PROHARTCHIN 258\r\n\nWHITE NIGHTS\r\n\r\nA SENTIMENTAL STORY FROM THE DIARY OF A DREAMER\r\n\nFIRST NIGHT\r\n\r\nIt was a wonderful night, such a night as is only possible when we are\r\nyoung, dear reader. The sky was so starry, so bright that, looking at\r\nit, one could not help asking oneself whether ill-humoured and\r\ncapricious people could live under such a sky. That is a youthful\r\nquestion too, dear reader, very youthful, but may the Lord put it more\r\nfrequently into your heart!... Speaking of capricious and ill-humoured\r\npeople, I cannot help recalling my moral condition all that day. From\r\nearly morning I had been oppressed by a strange despondency. It suddenly\r\nseemed to me that I was lonely, that every one was forsaking me and\r\ngoing away from me. Of course, any one is entitled to ask who \"every\r\none\" was. For though I had been living almost eight years in Petersburg\r\nI had hardly an acquaintance. But what did I want with acquaintances? I\r\nwas acquainted with all Petersburg as it was; that was why I felt as\r\nthough they were all deserting me when all Petersburg packed up and went\r\nto its summer villa. I felt afraid of being left alone, and for three\r\nwhole days I wandered about the town in profound dejection, not knowing\r\nwhat to do with myself. Whether I walked in the Nevsky, went to the\r\nGardens or sauntered on the embankment, there was not one face of those\r\nI had been accustomed to meet at the same time and place all the year.\r\nThey, of course, do not know me, but I know them. I know them\r\nintimately, I have almost made a study of their faces, and am delighted\r\nwhen they are gay, and downcast when they are under a cloud. I have\r\nalmost struck up a friendship with one old man whom I meet every blessed\r\nday, at the same hour in Fontanka. Such a grave, pensive countenance; he\r\nis always whispering to himself and brandishing his left arm, while in\r\nhis right hand he holds a long gnarled stick with a gold knob. He even\r\nnotices me and takes a warm interest in me. If I happen not to be at a\r\ncertain time in the same spot in Fontanka, I am certain he feels\r\ndisappointed. That is how it is that we almost bow to each other,\r\nespecially when we are both in good humour. The other day, when we had\r\nnot seen each other for two days and met on the third, we were actually\r\ntouching our hats, but, realizing in time, dropped our hands and passed\r\neach other with a look of interest.\r\n\r\nI know the houses too. As I walk along they seem to run forward in the\r\nstreets to look out at me from every window, and almost to say:\r\n\"Good-morning! How do you do? I am quite well, thank God, and I am to\r\nhave a new storey in May,\" or, \"How are you? I am being redecorated\r\nto-morrow;\" or, \"I was almost burnt down and had such a fright,\" and so\r\non. I have my favourites among them, some are dear friends; one of them\r\nintends to be treated by the architect this summer. I shall go every day\r\non purpose to see that the operation is not a failure. God forbid! But I\r\nshall never forget an incident with a very pretty little house of a\r\nlight pink colour. It was such a charming little brick house, it looked\r\nso hospitably at me, and so proudly at its ungainly neighbours, that my\r\nheart rejoiced whenever I happened to pass it. Suddenly last week I\r\nwalked along the street, and when I looked at my friend I heard a\r\nplaintive, \"They are painting me yellow!\" The villains! The barbarians!\r\nThey had spared nothing, neither columns, nor cornices, and my poor\r\nlittle friend was as yellow as a canary. It almost made me bilious. And\r\nto this day I have not had the courage to visit my poor disfigured\r\nfriend, painted the colour of the Celestial Empire.\r\n\r\nSo now you understand, reader, in what sense I am acquainted with all\r\nPetersburg.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned already that I had felt worried for three whole days\r\nbefore I guessed the cause of my uneasiness. And I felt ill at ease in\r\nthe street--this one had gone and that one had gone, and what had become\r\nof the other?--and at home I did not feel like myself either. For two\r\nevenings I was puzzling my brains to think what was amiss in my corner;\r\nwhy I felt so uncomfortable in it. And in perplexity I scanned my grimy\r\ngreen walls, my ceiling covered with a spider's web, the growth of which\r\nMatrona has so successfully encouraged. I looked over all my furniture,\r\nexamined every chair, wondering whether the trouble lay there (for if\r\none chair is not standing in the same position as it stood the day\r\nbefore, I am not myself). I looked at the window, but it was all in vain\r\n... I was not a bit the better for it! I even bethought me to send for\r\nMatrona, and was giving her some fatherly admonitions in regard to the\r\nspider's web and sluttishness in general; but she simply stared at me in\r\namazement and went away without saying a word, so that the spider's web\r\nis comfortably hanging in its place to this day. I only at last this\r\nmorning realized what was wrong. Aie! Why, they are giving me the slip\r\nand making off to their summer villas! Forgive the triviality of the\r\nexpression, but I am in no mood for fine language ... for everything\r\nthat had been in Petersburg had gone or was going away for the holidays;\r\nfor every respectable gentleman of dignified appearance who took a cab\r\nwas at once transformed, in my eyes, into a respectable head of a\r\nhousehold who after his daily duties were over, was making his way to\r\nthe bosom of his family, to the summer villa; for all the passers-by had\r\nnow quite a peculiar air which seemed to say to every one they met: \"We\r\nare only here for the moment, gentlemen, and in another two hours we\r\nshall be going off to the summer villa.\" If a window opened after\r\ndelicate fingers, white as snow, had tapped upon the pane, and the head\r\nof a pretty girl was thrust out, calling to a street-seller with pots of\r\nflowers--at once on the spot I fancied that those flowers were being\r\nbought not simply in order to enjoy the flowers and the spring in stuffy\r\ntown lodgings, but because they would all be very soon moving into the\r\ncountry and could take the flowers with them. What is more, I made such\r\nprogress in my new peculiar sort of investigation that I could\r\ndistinguish correctly from the mere air of each in what summer villa he\r\nwas living. The inhabitants of Kamenny and Aptekarsky Islands or of the\r\nPeterhof Road were marked by the studied elegance of their manner, their\r\nfashionable summer suits, and the fine carriages in which they drove to\r\ntown. Visitors to Pargolovo and places further away impressed one at\r\nfirst sight by their reasonable and dignified air; the tripper to\r\nKrestovsky Island could be recognized by his look of irrepressible\r\ngaiety. If I chanced to meet a long procession of waggoners walking\r\nlazily with the reins in their hands beside waggons loaded with regular\r\nmountains of furniture, tables, chairs, ottomans and sofas and domestic\r\nutensils of all sorts, frequently with a decrepit cook sitting on the\r\ntop of it all, guarding her master's property as though it were the\r\napple of her eye; or if I saw boats heavily loaded with household goods\r\ncrawling along the Neva or Fontanka to the Black River or the\r\nIslands--the waggons and the boats were multiplied tenfold, a\r\nhundredfold, in my eyes. I fancied that everything was astir and moving,\r\neverything was going in regular caravans to the summer villas. It seemed\r\nas though Petersburg threatened to become a wilderness, so that at last\r\nI felt ashamed, mortified and sad that I had nowhere to go for the\r\nholidays and no reason to go away. I was ready to go away with every\r\nwaggon, to drive off with every gentleman of respectable appearance who\r\ntook a cab; but no one--absolutely no one--invited me; it seemed they\r\nhad forgotten me, as though really I were a stranger to them!\r\n\r\nI took long walks, succeeding, as I usually did, in quite forgetting\r\nwhere I was, when I suddenly found myself at the city gates. Instantly I\r\nfelt lighthearted, and I passed the barrier and walked between\r\ncultivated fields and meadows, unconscious of fatigue, and feeling only\r\nall over as though a burden were falling off my soul. All the passers-by\r\ngave me such friendly looks that they seemed almost greeting me, they\r\nall seemed so pleased at something. They were all smoking cigars, every\r\none of them. And I felt pleased as I never had before. It was as though\r\nI had suddenly found myself in Italy--so strong was the effect of nature\r\nupon a half-sick townsman like me, almost stifling between city walls.\r\n\r\nThere is something inexpressibly touching in nature round Petersburg,\r\nwhen at the approach of spring she puts forth all her might, all the\r\npowers bestowed on her by Heaven, when she breaks into leaf, decks\r\nherself out and spangles herself with flowers.... Somehow I cannot help\r\nbeing reminded of a frail, consumptive girl, at whom one sometimes looks\r\nwith compassion, sometimes with sympathetic love, whom sometimes one\r\nsimply does not notice; though suddenly in one instant she becomes, as\r\nthough by chance, inexplicably lovely and exquisite, and, impressed and\r\nintoxicated, one cannot help asking oneself what power made those sad,\r\npensive eyes flash with such fire? What summoned the blood to those\r\npale, wan cheeks? What bathed with passion those soft features? What set\r\nthat bosom heaving? What so suddenly called strength, life and beauty\r\ninto the poor girl's face, making it gleam with such a smile, kindle\r\nwith such bright, sparkling laughter? You look round, you seek for some\r\none, you conjecture.... But the moment passes, and next day you meet,\r\nmaybe, the same pensive and preoccupied look as before, the same pale\r\nface, the same meek and timid movements, and even signs of remorse,\r\ntraces of a mortal anguish and regret for the fleeting distraction....\r\nAnd you grieve that the momentary beauty has faded so soon never to\r\nreturn, that it flashed upon you so treacherously, so vainly, grieve\r\nbecause you had not even time to love her....\r\n\r\nAnd yet my night was better than my day! This was how it happened.\r\n\r\nI came back to the town very late, and it had struck ten as I was going\r\ntowards my lodgings. My way lay along the canal embankment, where at\r\nthat hour you never meet a soul. It is true that I live in a very remote\r\npart of the town. I walked along singing, for when I am happy I am\r\nalways humming to myself like every happy man who has no friend or\r\nacquaintance with whom to share his joy. Suddenly I had a most\r\nunexpected adventure.\r\n\r\nLeaning on the canal railing stood a woman with her elbows on the rail,\r\nshe was apparently looking with great attention at the muddy water of\r\nthe canal. She was wearing a very charming yellow hat and a jaunty\r\nlittle black mantle. \"She's a girl, and I am sure she is dark,\" I\r\nthought. She did not seem to hear my footsteps, and did not even stir\r\nwhen I passed by with bated breath and loudly throbbing heart.\r\n\r\n\"Strange,\" I thought; \"she must be deeply absorbed in something,\" and\r\nall at once I stopped as though petrified. I heard a muffled sob. Yes! I\r\nwas not mistaken, the girl was crying, and a minute later I heard sob\r\nafter sob. Good Heavens! My heart sank. And timid as I was with women,\r\nyet this was such a moment!... I turned, took a step towards her, and\r\nshould certainly have pronounced the word \"Madam!\" if I had not known\r\nthat that exclamation has been uttered a thousand times in every Russian\r\nsociety novel. It was only that reflection stopped me. But while I was\r\nseeking for a word, the girl came to herself, looked round, started,\r\ncast down her eyes and slipped by me along the embankment. I at once\r\nfollowed her; but she, divining this, left the embankment, crossed the\r\nroad and walked along the pavement. I dared not cross the street after\r\nher. My heart was fluttering like a captured bird. All at once a chance\r\ncame to my aid.\r\n\r\nAlong the same side of the pavement there suddenly came into sight, not\r\nfar from the girl, a gentleman in evening dress, of dignified years,\r\nthough by no means of dignified carriage; he was staggering and\r\ncautiously leaning against the wall. The girl flew straight as an arrow,\r\nwith the timid haste one sees in all girls who do not want any one to\r\nvolunteer to accompany them home at night, and no doubt the staggering\r\ngentleman would not have pursued her, if my good luck had not prompted\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, without a word to any one, the gentleman set off and flew full\r\nspeed in pursuit of my unknown lady. She was racing like the wind, but\r\nthe staggering gentleman was overtaking--overtook her. The girl uttered\r\na shriek, and ... I bless my luck for the excellent knotted stick, which\r\nhappened on that occasion to be in my right hand. In a flash I was on\r\nthe other side of the street; in a flash the obtrusive gentleman had\r\ntaken in the position, had grasped the irresistible argument, fallen\r\nback without a word, and only when we were very far away protested\r\nagainst my action in rather vigorous language. But his words hardly\r\nreached us.\r\n\r\n\"Give me your arm,\" I said to the girl. \"And he won't dare to annoy us\r\nfurther.\"\r\n\r\nShe took my arm without a word, still trembling with excitement and\r\nterror. Oh, obtrusive gentleman! How I blessed you at that moment! I\r\nstole a glance at her, she was very charming and dark--I had guessed\r\nright.\r\n\r\nOn her black eyelashes there still glistened a tear--from her recent\r\nterror or her former grief--I don't know. But there was already a gleam\r\nof a smile on her lips. She too stole a glance at me, faintly blushed\r\nand looked down.\r\n\r\n\"There, you see; why did you drive me away? If I had been here, nothing\r\nwould have happened....\"\r\n\r\n\"But I did not know you; I thought that you too....\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, do you know me now?\"\r\n\r\n\"A little! Here, for instance, why are you trembling?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you are right at the first guess!\" I answered, delighted that my\r\ngirl had intelligence; that is never out of place in company with\r\nbeauty. \"Yes, from the first glance you have guessed the sort of man you\r\nhave to do with. Precisely; I am shy with women, I am agitated, I don't\r\ndeny it, as much so as you were a minute ago when that gentleman alarmed\r\nyou. I am in some alarm now. It's like a dream, and I never guessed even\r\nin my sleep that I should ever talk with any woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"What? Really?...\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; if my arm trembles, it is because it has never been held by a\r\npretty little hand like yours. I am a complete stranger to women; that\r\nis, I have never been used to them. You see, I am alone.... I don't even\r\nknow how to talk to them. Here, I don't know now whether I have not said\r\nsomething silly to you! Tell me frankly; I assure you beforehand that I\r\nam not quick to take offence?...\"\r\n\r\n\"No, nothing, nothing, quite the contrary. And if you insist on my\r\nspeaking frankly, I will tell you that women like such timidity; and if\r\nyou want to know more, I like it too, and I won't drive you away till I\r\nget home.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will make me,\" I said, breathless with delight, \"lose my timidity,\r\nand then farewell to all my chances....\"\r\n\r\n\"Chances! What chances--of what? That's not so nice.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, I am sorry, it was a slip of the tongue; but how can\r\nyou expect one at such a moment to have no desire....\"\r\n\r\n\"To be liked, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes; but do, for goodness' sake, be kind. Think what I am! Here,\r\nI am twenty-six and I have never seen any one. How can I speak well,\r\ntactfully, and to the point? It will seem better to you when I have told\r\nyou everything openly.... I don't know how to be silent when my heart is\r\nspeaking. Well, never mind.... Believe me, not one woman, never, never!\r\nNo acquaintance of any sort! And I do nothing but dream every day that\r\nat last I shall meet some one. Oh, if only you knew how often I have\r\nbeen in love in that way....\"\r\n\r\n\"How? With whom?...\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, with no one, with an ideal, with the one I dream of in my sleep. I\r\nmake up regular romances in my dreams. Ah, you don't know me! It's true,\r\nof course, I have met two or three women, but what sort of women were\r\nthey? They were all landladies, that.... But I shall make you laugh if I\r\ntell you that I have several times thought of speaking, just simply\r\nspeaking, to some aristocratic lady in the street, when she is alone, I\r\nneed hardly say; speaking to her, of course, timidly, respectfully,\r\npassionately; telling her that I am perishing in solitude, begging her\r\nnot to send me away; saying that I have no chance of making the\r\nacquaintance of any woman; impressing upon her that it is a positive\r\nduty for a woman not to repulse so timid a prayer from such a luckless\r\nman as me. That, in fact, all I ask is, that she should say two or three\r\nsisterly words with sympathy, should not repulse me at first sight;\r\nshould take me on trust and listen to what I say; should laugh at me if\r\nshe likes, encourage me, say two words to me, only two words, even\r\nthough we never meet again afterwards!... But you are laughing; however,\r\nthat is why I am telling you....\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be vexed; I am only laughing at your being your own enemy, and if\r\nyou had tried you would have succeeded, perhaps, even though it had been\r\nin the street; the simpler the better.... No kind-hearted woman, unless\r\nshe were stupid or, still more, vexed about something at the moment,\r\ncould bring herself to send you away without those two words which you\r\nask for so timidly.... But what am I saying? Of course she would take\r\nyou for a madman. I was judging by myself; I know a good deal about\r\nother people's lives.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, thank you,\" I cried; \"you don't know what you have done for me\r\nnow!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad! I am glad! But tell me how did you find out that I was the\r\nsort of woman with whom ... well, whom you think worthy ... of attention\r\nand friendship ... in fact, not a landlady as you say? What made you\r\ndecide to come up to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"What made me?... But you were alone; that gentleman was too insolent;\r\nit's night. You must admit that it was a duty....\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no; I mean before, on the other side--you know you meant to come up\r\nto me.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the other side? Really I don't know how to answer; I am afraid\r\nto.... Do you know I have been happy to-day? I walked along singing; I\r\nwent out into the country; I have never had such happy moments. You ...\r\nperhaps it was my fancy.... Forgive me for referring to it; I fancied\r\nyou were crying, and I ... could not bear to hear it ... it made my\r\nheart ache.... Oh, my goodness! Surely I might be troubled about you?\r\nSurely there was no harm in feeling brotherly compassion for you.... I\r\nbeg your pardon, I said compassion.... Well, in short, surely you would\r\nnot be offended at my involuntary impulse to go up to you?...\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop, that's enough, don't talk of it,\" said the girl, looking down,\r\nand pressing my hand. \"It's my fault for having spoken of it; but I am\r\nglad I was not mistaken in you.... But here I am home; I must go down\r\nthis turning, it's two steps from here.... Good-bye, thank you!...\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely ... surely you don't mean ... that we shall never see each other\r\nagain?... Surely this is not to be the end?\"\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" said the girl, laughing, \"at first you only wanted two words,\r\nand now.... However, I won't say anything ... perhaps we shall meet....\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall come here to-morrow,\" I said. \"Oh, forgive me, I am already\r\nmaking demands....\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you are not very patient ... you are almost insisting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen, listen!\" I interrupted her. \"Forgive me if I tell you something\r\nelse.... I tell you what, I can't help coming here to-morrow, I am a\r\ndreamer; I have so little real life that I look upon such moments as\r\nthis now, as so rare, that I cannot help going over such moments again\r\nin my dreams. I shall be dreaming of you all night, a whole week, a\r\nwhole year. I shall certainly come here to-morrow, just here to this\r\nplace, just at the same hour, and I shall be happy remembering to-day.\r\nThis place is dear to me already. I have already two or three such\r\nplaces in Petersburg. I once shed tears over memories ... like you....\r\nWho knows, perhaps you were weeping ten minutes ago over some memory....\r\nBut, forgive me, I have forgotten myself again; perhaps you have once\r\nbeen particularly happy here....\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" said the girl, \"perhaps I will come here to-morrow, too, at\r\nten o'clock. I see that I can't forbid you.... The fact is, I have to be\r\nhere; don't imagine that I am making an appointment with you; I tell you\r\nbeforehand that I have to be here on my own account. But ... well, I\r\ntell you straight out, I don't mind if you do come. To begin with,\r\nsomething unpleasant might happen as it did to-day, but never mind\r\nthat.... In short, I should simply like to see you ... to say two words\r\nto you. Only, mind, you must not think the worse of me now! Don't think\r\nI make appointments so lightly.... I shouldn't make it except that....\r\nBut let that be my secret! Only a compact beforehand....\"\r\n\r\n\"A compact! Speak, tell me, tell me all beforehand; I agree to anything,\r\nI am ready for anything,\" I cried delighted. \"I answer for myself, I\r\nwill be obedient, respectful ... you know me....\"\r\n\r\n\"It's just because I do know you that I ask you to come to-morrow,\" said\r\nthe girl, laughing. \"I know you perfectly. But mind you will come on the\r\ncondition, in the first place (only be good, do what I ask--you see, I\r\nspeak frankly), you won't fall in love with me.... That's impossible, I\r\nassure you. I am ready for friendship; here's my hand.... But you\r\nmustn't fall in love with me, I beg you!\"\r\n\r\n\"I swear,\" I cried, gripping her hand....\r\n\r\n\"Hush, don't swear, I know you are ready to flare up like gunpowder.\r\nDon't think ill of me for saying so. If only you knew.... I, too, have\r\nno one to whom I can say a word, whose advice I can ask. Of course, one\r\ndoes not look for an adviser in the street; but you are an exception. I\r\nknow you as though we had been friends for twenty years.... You won't\r\ndeceive me, will you?...\"\r\n\r\n\"You will see ... the only thing is, I don't know how I am going to\r\nsurvive the next twenty-four hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sleep soundly. Good-night, and remember that I have trusted you\r\nalready. But you exclaimed so nicely just now, 'Surely one can't be held\r\nresponsible for every feeling, even for brotherly sympathy!' Do you\r\nknow, that was so nicely said, that the idea struck me at once, that I\r\nmight confide in you?\"\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake do; but about what? What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait till to-morrow. Meanwhile, let that be a secret. So much the\r\nbetter for you; it will give it a faint flavour of romance. Perhaps I\r\nwill tell you to-morrow, and perhaps not.... I will talk to you a little\r\nmore beforehand; we will get to know each other better....\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, I will tell you all about myself to-morrow! But what has\r\nhappened? It is as though a miracle had befallen me.... My God, where am\r\nI? Come, tell me aren't you glad that you were not angry and did not\r\ndrive me away at the first moment, as any other woman would have done?\r\nIn two minutes you have made me happy for ever. Yes, happy; who knows,\r\nperhaps, you have reconciled me with myself, solved my doubts!...\r\nPerhaps such moments come upon me.... But there I will tell you all\r\nabout it to-morrow, you shall know everything, everything....\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, I consent; you shall begin....\"\r\n\r\n\"Agreed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye till to-morrow!\"\r\n\r\n\"Till to-morrow!\"\r\n\r\nAnd we parted. I walked about all night; I could not make up my mind to\r\ngo home. I was so happy.... To-morrow!\r\n\nSECOND NIGHT\r\n\r\n\"Well, so you have survived!\" she said, pressing both my hands.\r\n\r\n\"I've been here for the last two hours; you don't know what a state I\r\nhave been in all day.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, I know. But to business. Do you know why I have come? Not to\r\ntalk nonsense, as I did yesterday. I tell you what, we must behave more\r\nsensibly in future. I thought a great deal about it last night.\"\r\n\r\n\"In what way--in what must we be more sensible? I am ready for my part;\r\nbut, really, nothing more sensible has happened to me in my life than\r\nthis, now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really? In the first place, I beg you not to squeeze my hands so;\r\nsecondly, I must tell you that I spent a long time thinking about you\r\nand feeling doubtful to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how did it end?\"\r\n\r\n\"How did it end? The upshot of it is that we must begin all over again,\r\nbecause the conclusion I reached to-day was that I don't know you at\r\nall; that I behaved like a baby last night, like a little girl; and, of\r\ncourse, the fact of it is, that it's my soft heart that is to\r\nblame--that is, I sang my own praises, as one always does in the end\r\nwhen one analyses one's conduct. And therefore to correct my mistake,\r\nI've made up my mind to find out all about you minutely. But as I have\r\nno one from whom I can find out anything, you must tell me everything\r\nfully yourself. Well, what sort of man are you? Come, make\r\nhaste--begin--tell me your whole history.\"\r\n\r\n\"My history!\" I cried in alarm. \"My history! But who has told you I have\r\na history? I have no history....\"\r\n\r\n\"Then how have you lived, if you have no history?\" she interrupted,\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely without any history! I have lived, as they say, keeping\r\nmyself to myself, that is, utterly alone--alone, entirely alone. Do you\r\nknow what it means to be alone?\"\r\n\r\n\"But how alone? Do you mean you never saw any one?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, I see people, of course; but still I am alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, do you never talk to any one?\"\r\n\r\n\"Strictly speaking, with no one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are you then? Explain yourself! Stay, I guess: most likely, like me\r\nyou have a grandmother. She is blind and will never let me go anywhere,\r\nso that I have almost forgotten how to talk; and when I played some\r\npranks two years ago, and she saw there was no holding me in, she called\r\nme up and pinned my dress to hers, and ever since we sit like that for\r\ndays together; she knits a stocking, though she's blind, and I sit\r\nbeside her, sew or read aloud to her--it's such a queer habit, here for\r\ntwo years I've been pinned to her....\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Heavens! what misery! But no, I haven't a grandmother like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you haven't why do you sit at home?...\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen, do you want to know the sort of man I am?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes!\"\r\n\r\n\"In the strict sense of the word?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the very strictest sense of the word.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, I am a type!\"\r\n\r\n\"Type, type! What sort of type?\" cried the girl, laughing, as though she\r\nhad not had a chance of laughing for a whole year. \"Yes, it's very\r\namusing talking to you. Look, here's a seat, let us sit down. No one is\r\npassing here, no one will hear us, and--begin your history. For it's no\r\ngood your telling me, I know you have a history; only you are concealing\r\nit. To begin with, what is a type?\"\r\n\r\n\"A type? A type is an original, it's an absurd person!\" I said, infected\r\nby her childish laughter. \"It's a character. Listen; do you know what is\r\nmeant by a dreamer?\"\r\n\r\n\"A dreamer! Indeed I should think I do know. I am a dreamer myself.\r\nSometimes, as I sit by grandmother, all sorts of things come into my\r\nhead. Why, when one begins dreaming one lets one's fancy run away with\r\none--why, I marry a Chinese Prince!... Though sometimes it is a good\r\nthing to dream! But, goodness knows! Especially when one has something\r\nto think of apart from dreams,\" added the girl, this time rather\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\n\"Excellent! If you have been married to a Chinese Emperor, you will\r\nquite understand me. Come, listen.... But one minute, I don't know your\r\nname yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"At last! You have been in no hurry to think of it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my goodness! It never entered my head, I felt quite happy as it\r\nwas....\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is Nastenka.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nastenka! And nothing else?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing else! Why, is not that enough for you, you insatiable person?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not enough? On the contrary, it's a great deal, a very great deal,\r\nNastenka; you kind girl, if you are Nastenka for me from the first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so! Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, listen, Nastenka, now for this absurd history.\"\r\n\r\nI sat down beside her, assumed a pedantically serious attitude, and\r\nbegan as though reading from a manuscript:--\r\n\r\n\"There are, Nastenka, though you may not know it, strange nooks in\r\nPetersburg. It seems as though the same sun as shines for all Petersburg\r\npeople does not peep into those spots, but some other different new one,\r\nbespoken expressly for those nooks, and it throws a different light on\r\neverything. In these corners, dear Nastenka, quite a different life is\r\nlived, quite unlike the life that is surging round us, but such as\r\nperhaps exists in some unknown realm, not among us in our serious,\r\nover-serious, time. Well, that life is a mixture of something purely\r\nfantastic, fervently ideal, with something (alas! Nastenka) dingily\r\nprosaic and ordinary, not to say incredibly vulgar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Foo! Good Heavens! What a preface! What do I hear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Nastenka. (It seems to me I shall never be tired of calling you\r\nNastenka.) Let me tell you that in these corners live strange\r\npeople--dreamers. The dreamer--if you want an exact definition--is not a\r\nhuman being, but a creature of an intermediate sort. For the most part\r\nhe settles in some inaccessible corner, as though hiding from the light\r\nof day; once he slips into his corner, he grows to it like a snail, or,\r\nanyway, he is in that respect very much like that remarkable creature,\r\nwhich is an animal and a house both at once, and is called a tortoise.\r\nWhy do you suppose he is so fond of his four walls, which are invariably\r\npainted green, grimy, dismal and reeking unpardonably of tobacco smoke?\r\nWhy is it that when this absurd gentleman is visited by one of his few\r\nacquaintances (and he ends by getting rid of all his friends), why does\r\nthis absurd person meet him with such embarrassment, changing\r\ncountenance and overcome with confusion, as though he had only just\r\ncommitted some crime within his four walls; as though he had been\r\nforging counterfeit notes, or as though he were writing verses to be\r\nsent to a journal with an anonymous letter, in which he states that the\r\nreal poet is dead, and that his friend thinks it his sacred duty to\r\npublish his things? Why, tell me, Nastenka, why is it conversation is\r\nnot easy between the two friends? Why is there no laughter? Why does no\r\nlively word fly from the tongue of the perplexed newcomer, who at other\r\ntimes may be very fond of laughter, lively words, conversation about the\r\nfair sex, and other cheerful subjects? And why does this friend,\r\nprobably a new friend and on his first visit--for there will hardly be a\r\nsecond, and the friend will never come again--why is the friend himself\r\nso confused, so tongue-tied, in spite of his wit (if he has any), as he\r\nlooks at the downcast face of his host, who in his turn becomes utterly\r\nhelpless and at his wits' end after gigantic but fruitless efforts to\r\nsmooth things over and enliven the conversation, to show his knowledge\r\nof polite society, to talk, too, of the fair sex, and by such humble\r\nendeavour, to please the poor man, who like a fish out of water has\r\nmistakenly come to visit him? Why does the gentleman, all at once\r\nremembering some very necessary business which never existed, suddenly\r\nseize his hat and hurriedly make off, snatching away his hand from the\r\nwarm grip of his host, who was trying his utmost to show his regret and\r\nretrieve the lost position? Why does the friend chuckle as he goes out\r\nof the door, and swear never to come and see this queer creature again,\r\nthough the queer creature is really a very good fellow, and at the same\r\ntime he cannot refuse his imagination the little diversion of comparing\r\nthe queer fellow's countenance during their conversation with the\r\nexpression of an unhappy kitten treacherously captured, roughly handled,\r\nfrightened and subjected to all sorts of indignities by children, till,\r\nutterly crestfallen, it hides away from them under a chair in the dark,\r\nand there must needs at its leisure bristle up, spit, and wash its\r\ninsulted face with both paws, and long afterwards look angrily at life\r\nand nature, and even at the bits saved from the master's dinner for it\r\nby the sympathetic housekeeper?\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" interrupted Nastenka, who had listened to me all the time in\r\namazement, opening her eyes and her little mouth. \"Listen; I don't know\r\nin the least why it happened and why you ask me such absurd questions;\r\nall I know is, that this adventure must have happened word for word to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doubtless,\" I answered, with the gravest face.\r\n\r\n\"Well, since there is no doubt about it, go on,\" said Nastenka, \"because\r\nI want very much to know how it will end.\"\r\n\r\n\"You want to know, Nastenka, what our hero, that is I--for the hero of\r\nthe whole business was my humble self--did in his corner? You want to\r\nknow why I lost my head and was upset for the whole day by the\r\nunexpected visit of a friend? You want to know why I was so startled,\r\nwhy I blushed when the door of my room was opened, why I was not able to\r\nentertain my visitor, and why I was crushed under the weight of my own\r\nhospitality?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes, yes,\" answered Nastenka, \"that's the point. Listen. You\r\ndescribe it all splendidly, but couldn't you perhaps describe it a\r\nlittle less splendidly? You talk as though you were reading it out of a\r\nbook.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nastenka,\" I answered in a stern and dignified voice, hardly able to\r\nkeep from laughing, \"dear Nastenka, I know I describe splendidly, but,\r\nexcuse me, I don't know how else to do it. At this moment, dear\r\nNastenka, at this moment I am like the spirit of King Solomon when,\r\nafter lying a thousand years under seven seals in his urn, those seven\r\nseals were at last taken off. At this moment, Nastenka, when we have met\r\nat last after such a long separation--for I have known you for ages,\r\nNastenka, because I have been looking for some one for ages, and that is\r\na sign that it was you I was looking for, and it was ordained that we\r\nshould meet now--at this moment a thousand valves have opened in my\r\nhead, and I must let myself flow in a river of words, or I shall choke.\r\nAnd so I beg you not to interrupt me, Nastenka, but listen humbly and\r\nobediently, or I will be silent.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, no! Not at all. Go on! I won't say a word!\"\r\n\r\n\"I will continue. There is, my friend Nastenka, one hour in my day which\r\nI like extremely. That is the hour when almost all business, work and\r\nduties are over, and every one is hurrying home to dinner, to lie down,\r\nto rest, and on the way all are cogitating on other more cheerful\r\nsubjects relating to their evenings, their nights, and all the rest of\r\ntheir free time. At that hour our hero--for allow me, Nastenka, to tell\r\nmy story in the third person, for one feels awfully ashamed to tell it\r\nin the first person--and so at that hour our hero, who had his work too,\r\nwas pacing along after the others. But a strange feeling of pleasure set\r\nhis pale, rather crumpled-looking face working. He looked not with\r\nindifference on the evening glow which was slowly fading on the cold\r\nPetersburg sky. When I say he looked, I am lying: he did not look at it,\r\nbut saw it as it were without realizing, as though tired or preoccupied\r\nwith some other more interesting subject, so that he could scarcely\r\nspare a glance for anything about him. He was pleased because till next\r\nday he was released from business irksome to him, and happy as a\r\nschoolboy let out from the class-room to his games and mischief. Take a\r\nlook at him, Nastenka; you will see at once that joyful emotion has\r\nalready had an effect on his weak nerves and morbidly excited fancy. You\r\nsee he is thinking of something.... Of dinner, do you imagine? Of the\r\nevening? What is he looking at like that? Is it at that gentleman of\r\ndignified appearance who is bowing so picturesquely to the lady who\r\nrolls by in a carriage drawn by prancing horses? No, Nastenka; what are\r\nall those trivialities to him now! He is rich now with his _own\r\nindividual_ life; he has suddenly become rich, and it is not for\r\nnothing that the fading sunset sheds its farewell gleams so gaily before\r\nhim, and calls forth a swarm of impressions from his warmed heart. Now\r\nhe hardly notices the road, on which the tiniest details at other times\r\nwould strike him. Now 'the Goddess of Fancy' (if you have read\r\nZhukovsky, dear Nastenka) has already with fantastic hand spun her\r\ngolden warp and begun weaving upon it patterns of marvellous magic\r\nlife--and who knows, maybe, her fantastic hand has borne him to the\r\nseventh crystal heaven far from the excellent granite pavement on which\r\nhe was walking his way? Try stopping him now, ask him suddenly where he\r\nis standing now, through what streets he is going--he will, probably\r\nremember nothing, neither where he is going nor where he is standing\r\nnow, and flushing with vexation he will certainly tell some lie to save\r\nappearances. That is why he starts, almost cries out, and looks round\r\nwith horror when a respectable old lady stops him politely in the middle\r\nof the pavement and asks her way. Frowning with vexation he strides on,\r\nscarcely noticing that more than one passer-by smiles and turns round to\r\nlook after him, and that a little girl, moving out of his way in alarm,\r\nlaughs aloud, gazing open-eyed at his broad meditative smile and\r\ngesticulations. But fancy catches up in its playful flight the old\r\nwoman, the curious passers-by, and the laughing child, and the peasants\r\nspending their nights in their barges on Fontanka (our hero, let us\r\nsuppose, is walking along the canal-side at that moment), and\r\ncapriciously weaves every one and everything into the canvas like a fly\r\nin a spider's web. And it is only after the queer fellow has returned to\r\nhis comfortable den with fresh stores for his mind to work on, has sat\r\ndown and finished his dinner, that he comes to himself, when Matrona who\r\nwaits upon him--always thoughtful and depressed--clears the table and\r\ngives him his pipe; he comes to himself then and recalls with surprise\r\nthat he has dined, though he has absolutely no notion how it has\r\nhappened. It has grown dark in the room; his soul is sad and empty; the\r\nwhole kingdom of fancies drops to pieces about him, drops to pieces\r\nwithout a trace, without a sound, floats away like a dream, and he\r\ncannot himself remember what he was dreaming. But a vague sensation\r\nfaintly stirs his heart and sets it aching, some new desire temptingly\r\ntickles and excites his fancy, and imperceptibly evokes a swarm of fresh\r\nphantoms. Stillness reigns in the little room; imagination is fostered\r\nby solitude and idleness; it is faintly smouldering, faintly simmering,\r\nlike the water with which old Matrona is making her coffee as she moves\r\nquietly about in the kitchen close by. Now it breaks out spasmodically;\r\nand the book, picked up aimlessly and at random, drops from my dreamer's\r\nhand before he has reached the third page. His imagination is again\r\nstirred and at work, and again a new world, a new fascinating life opens\r\nvistas before him. A fresh dream--fresh happiness! A fresh rush of\r\ndelicate, voluptuous poison! What is real life to him! To his corrupted\r\neyes we live, you and I, Nastenka, so torpidly, slowly, insipidly; in\r\nhis eyes we are all so dissatisfied with our fate, so exhausted by our\r\nlife! And, truly, see how at first sight everything is cold, morose, as\r\nthough ill-humoured among us.... Poor things! thinks our dreamer. And it\r\nis no wonder that he thinks it! Look at these magic phantasms, which so\r\nenchantingly, so whimsically, so carelessly and freely group before him\r\nin such a magic, animated picture, in which the most prominent figure in\r\nthe foreground is of course himself, our dreamer, in his precious\r\nperson. See what varied adventures, what an endless swarm of ecstatic\r\ndreams. You ask, perhaps, what he is dreaming of. Why ask that?--why, of\r\neverything ... of the lot of the poet, first unrecognized, then crowned\r\nwith laurels; of friendship with Hoffmann, St. Bartholomew's Night, of\r\nDiana Vernon, of playing the hero at the taking of Kazan by Ivan\r\nVassilyevitch, of Clara Mowbray, of Effie Deans, of the council of the\r\nprelates and Huss before them, of the rising of the dead in 'Robert the\r\nDevil' (do you remember the music, it smells of the churchyard!), of\r\nMinna and Brenda, of the battle of Berezina, of the reading of a poem at\r\nCountess V. D.'s, of Danton, of Cleopatra _ei suoi amanti_, of a\r\nlittle house in Kolomna, of a little home of one's own and beside one a\r\ndear creature who listens to one on a winter's evening, opening her\r\nlittle mouth and eyes as you are listening to me now, my angel.... No,\r\nNastenka, what is there, what is there for him, voluptuous sluggard, in\r\nthis life, for which you and I have such a longing? He thinks that this\r\nis a poor pitiful life, not foreseeing that for him too, maybe, sometime\r\nthe mournful hour may strike, when for one day of that pitiful life he\r\nwould give all his years of phantasy, and would give them not only for\r\njoy and for happiness, but without caring to make distinctions in that\r\nhour of sadness, remorse and unchecked grief. But so far that\r\nthreatening has not arrived--he desires nothing, because he is superior\r\nto all desire, because he has everything, because he is satiated,\r\nbecause he is the artist of his own life, and creates it for himself\r\nevery hour to suit his latest whim. And you know this fantastic world of\r\nfairyland is so easily, so naturally created! As though it were not a\r\ndelusion! Indeed, he is ready to believe at some moments that all this\r\nlife is not suggested by feeling, is not mirage, not a delusion of the\r\nimagination, but that it is concrete, real, substantial! Why is it,\r\nNastenka, why is it at such moments one holds one's breath? Why, by what\r\nsorcery, through what incomprehensible caprice, is the pulse quickened,\r\ndoes a tear start from the dreamer's eye, while his pale moist cheeks\r\nglow, while his whole being is suffused with an inexpressible sense of\r\nconsolation? Why is it that whole sleepless nights pass like a flash in\r\ninexhaustible gladness and happiness, and when the dawn gleams rosy at\r\nthe window and daybreak floods the gloomy room with uncertain, fantastic\r\nlight, as in Petersburg, our dreamer, worn out and exhausted, flings\r\nhimself on his bed and drops asleep with thrills of delight in his\r\nmorbidly overwrought spirit, and with a weary sweet ache in his heart?\r\nYes, Nastenka, one deceives oneself and unconsciously believes that real\r\ntrue passion is stirring one's soul; one unconsciously believes that\r\nthere is something living, tangible in one's immaterial dreams! And is\r\nit delusion? Here love, for instance, is bound up with all its\r\nfathomless joy, all its torturing agonies in his bosom.... Only look at\r\nhim, and you will be convinced! Would you believe, looking at him, dear\r\nNastenka, that he has never known her whom he loves in his ecstatic\r\ndreams? Can it be that he has only seen her in seductive visions, and\r\nthat this passion has been nothing but a dream? Surely they must have\r\nspent years hand in hand together--alone the two of them, casting off\r\nall the world and each uniting his or her life with the other's? Surely\r\nwhen the hour of parting came she must have lain sobbing and grieving on\r\nhis bosom, heedless of the tempest raging under the sullen sky, heedless\r\nof the wind which snatches and bears away the tears from her black\r\neyelashes? Can all of that have been a dream--and that garden, dejected,\r\nforsaken, run wild, with its little moss-grown paths, solitary, gloomy,\r\nwhere they used to walk so happily together, where they hoped, grieved,\r\nloved, loved each other so long, \"so long and so fondly?\" And that queer\r\nancestral house where she spent so many years lonely and sad with her\r\nmorose old husband, always silent and splenetic, who frightened them,\r\nwhile timid as children they hid their love from each other? What\r\ntorments they suffered, what agonies of terror, how innocent, how pure\r\nwas their love, and how (I need hardly say, Nastenka) malicious people\r\nwere! And, good Heavens! surely he met her afterwards, far from their\r\nnative shores, under alien skies, in the hot south in the divinely\r\neternal city, in the dazzling splendour of the ball to the crash of\r\nmusic, in a _palazzo_ (it must be in a _palazzo_), drowned in\r\na sea of lights, on the balcony, wreathed in myrtle and roses, where,\r\nrecognizing him, she hurriedly removes her mask and whispering, 'I am\r\nfree,' flings herself trembling into his arms, and with a cry of\r\nrapture, clinging to one another, in one instant they forget their\r\nsorrow and their parting and all their agonies, and the gloomy house and\r\nthe old man and the dismal garden in that distant land, and the seat on\r\nwhich with a last passionate kiss she tore herself away from his arms\r\nnumb with anguish and despair.... Oh, Nastenka, you must admit that one\r\nwould start, betray confusion, and blush like a schoolboy who has just\r\nstuffed in his pocket an apple stolen from a neighbour's garden, when\r\nyour uninvited visitor, some stalwart, lanky fellow, a festive soul fond\r\nof a joke, opens your door and shouts out as though nothing were\r\nhappening: 'My dear boy, I have this minute come from Pavlovsk.' My\r\ngoodness! the old count is dead, unutterable happiness is close at\r\nhand--and people arrive from Pavlovsk!\"\r\n\r\nFinishing my pathetic appeal, I paused pathetically. I remembered that I\r\nhad an intense desire to force myself to laugh, for I was already\r\nfeeling that a malignant demon was stirring within me, that there was a\r\nlump in my throat, that my chin was beginning to twitch, and that my\r\neyes were growing more and more moist.\r\n\r\nI expected Nastenka, who listened to me opening her clever eyes, would\r\nbreak into her childish, irrepressible laugh; and I was already\r\nregretting that I had gone so far, that I had unnecessarily described\r\nwhat had long been simmering in my heart, about which I could speak as\r\nthough from a written account of it, because I had long ago passed\r\njudgment on myself and now could not resist reading it, making my\r\nconfession, without expecting to be understood; but to my surprise she\r\nwas silent, waiting a little, then she faintly pressed my hand and with\r\ntimid sympathy asked--\r\n\r\n\"Surely you haven't lived like that all your life?\"\r\n\r\n\"All my life, Nastenka,\" I answered; \"all my life, and it seems to me I\r\nshall go on so to the end.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, that won't do,\" she said uneasily, \"that must not be; and so,\r\nmaybe, I shall spend all my life beside grandmother. Do you know, it is\r\nnot at all good to live like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, Nastenka, I know!\" I cried, unable to restrain my feelings\r\nlonger. \"And I realize now, more than ever, that I have lost all my best\r\nyears! And now I know it and feel it more painfully from recognizing\r\nthat God has sent me you, my good angel, to tell me that and show it.\r\nNow that I sit beside you and talk to you it is strange for me to think\r\nof the future, for in the future--there is loneliness again, again this\r\nmusty, useless life; and what shall I have to dream of when I have been\r\nso happy in reality beside you! Oh, may you be blessed, dear girl, for\r\nnot having repulsed me at first, for enabling me to say that for two\r\nevenings, at least, I have lived.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, no!\" cried Nastenka and tears glistened in her eyes. \"No, it\r\nmustn't be so any more; we must not part like that! what are two\r\nevenings?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Nastenka, Nastenka! Do you know how far you have reconciled me to\r\nmyself? Do you know now that I shall not think so ill of myself, as I\r\nhave at some moments? Do you know that, maybe, I shall leave off\r\ngrieving over the crime and sin of my life? for such a life is a crime\r\nand a sin. And do not imagine that I have been exaggerating\r\nanything--for goodness' sake don't think that, Nastenka: for at times\r\nsuch misery comes over me, such misery.... Because it begins to seem to\r\nme at such times that I am incapable of beginning a life in real life,\r\nbecause it has seemed to me that I have lost all touch, all instinct for\r\nthe actual, the real; because at last I have cursed myself; because\r\nafter my fantastic nights I have moments of returning sobriety, which\r\nare awful! Meanwhile, you hear the whirl and roar of the crowd in the\r\nvortex of life around you; you hear, you see, men living in reality; you\r\nsee that life for them is not forbidden, that their life does not float\r\naway like a dream, like a vision; that their life is being eternally\r\nrenewed, eternally youthful, and not one hour of it is the same as\r\nanother; while fancy is so spiritless, monotonous to vulgarity and\r\neasily scared, the slave of shadows, of the idea, the slave of the first\r\ncloud that shrouds the sun, and overcasts with depression the true\r\nPetersburg heart so devoted to the sun--and what is fancy in depression!\r\nOne feels that this _inexhaustible_ fancy is weary at last and worn\r\nout with continual exercise, because one is growing into manhood,\r\noutgrowing one's old ideals: they are being shattered into fragments,\r\ninto dust; if there is no other life one must build one up from the\r\nfragments. And meanwhile the soul longs and craves for something else!\r\nAnd in vain the dreamer rakes over his old dreams, as though seeking a\r\nspark among the embers, to fan them into flame, to warm his chilled\r\nheart by the rekindled fire, and to rouse up in it again all that was so\r\nsweet, that touched his heart, that set his blood boiling, drew tears\r\nfrom his eyes, and so luxuriously deceived him! Do you know, Nastenka,\r\nthe point I have reached? Do you know that I am forced now to celebrate\r\nthe anniversary of my own sensations, the anniversary of that which was\r\nonce so sweet, which never existed in reality--for this anniversary is\r\nkept in memory of those same foolish, shadowy dreams--and to do this\r\nbecause those foolish dreams are no more, because I have nothing to earn\r\nthem with; you know even dreams do not come for nothing! Do you know\r\nthat I love now to recall and visit at certain dates the places where I\r\nwas once happy in my own way? I love to build up my present in harmony\r\nwith the irrevocable past, and I often wander like a shadow, aimless,\r\nsad and dejected, about the streets and crooked lanes of Petersburg.\r\nWhat memories they are! To remember, for instance, that here just a year\r\nago, just at this time, at this hour, on this pavement, I wandered just\r\nas lonely, just as dejected as to-day. And one remembers that then one's\r\ndreams were sad, and though the past was no better one feels as though\r\nit had somehow been better, and that life was more peaceful, that one\r\nwas free from the black thoughts that haunt one now; that one was free\r\nfrom the gnawing of conscience--the gloomy, sullen gnawing which now\r\ngives me no rest by day or by night. And one asks oneself where are\r\none's dreams. And one shakes one's head and says how rapidly the years\r\nfly by! And again one asks oneself what has one done with one's years.\r\nWhere have you buried your best days? Have you lived or not? Look, one\r\nsays to oneself, look how cold the world is growing. Some more years\r\nwill pass, and after them will come gloomy solitude; then will come old\r\nage trembling on its crutch, and after it misery and desolation. Your\r\nfantastic world will grow pale, your dreams will fade and die and will\r\nfall like the yellow leaves from the trees.... Oh, Nastenka! you know it\r\nwill be sad to be left alone, utterly alone, and to have not even\r\nanything to regret--nothing, absolutely nothing ... for all that you\r\nhave lost, all that, all was nothing, stupid, simple nullity, there has\r\nbeen nothing but dreams!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, don't work on my feelings any more,\" said Nastenka, wiping away a\r\ntear which was trickling down her cheek. \"Now it's over! Now we shall be\r\ntwo together. Now, whatever happens to me, we will never part. Listen; I\r\nam a simple girl, I have not had much education, though grandmother did\r\nget a teacher for me, but truly I understand you, for all that you have\r\ndescribed I have been through myself, when grandmother pinned me to her\r\ndress. Of course, I should not have described it so well as you have; I\r\nam not educated,\" she added timidly, for she was still feeling a sort of\r\nrespect for my pathetic eloquence and lofty style; \"but I am very glad\r\nthat you have been quite open with me. Now I know you thoroughly, all of\r\nyou. And do you know what? I want to tell you my history too, all\r\nwithout concealment, and after that you must give me advice. You are a\r\nvery clever man; will you promise to give me advice?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Nastenka,\" I cried, \"though I have never given advice, still less\r\nsensible advice, yet I see now that if we always go on like this that it\r\nwill be very sensible, and that each of us will give the other a great\r\ndeal of sensible advice! Well, my pretty Nastenka, what sort of advice\r\ndo you want? Tell me frankly; at this moment I am so gay and happy, so\r\nbold and sensible, that it won't be difficult for me to find words.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" Nastenka interrupted, laughing. \"I don't only want sensible\r\nadvice, I want warm brotherly advice, as though you had been fond of me\r\nall your life!\"\r\n\r\n\"Agreed, Nastenka, agreed!\" I cried delighted; \"and if I had been fond\r\nof you for twenty years, I couldn't have been fonder of you than I am\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your hand,\" said Nastenka.\r\n\r\n\"Here it is,\" said I, giving her my hand.\r\n\r\n\"And so let us begin my history!\"\r\n\nNASTENKA'S HISTORY\r\n\r\n\"Half my story you know already--that is, you know that I have an old\r\ngrandmother....\"\r\n\r\n\"If the other half is as brief as that ...\" I interrupted, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"Be quiet and listen. First of all you must agree not to interrupt me,\r\nor else, perhaps I shall get in a muddle! Come, listen quietly.\r\n\r\n\"I have an old grandmother. I came into her hands when I was quite a\r\nlittle girl, for my father and mother are dead. It must be supposed that\r\ngrandmother was once richer, for now she recalls better days. She taught\r\nme French, and then got a teacher for me. When I was fifteen (and now I\r\nam seventeen) we gave up having lessons. It was at that time that I got\r\ninto mischief; what I did I won't tell you; it's enough to say that it\r\nwasn't very important. But grandmother called me to her one morning and\r\nsaid that as she was blind she could not look after me; she took a pin\r\nand pinned my dress to hers, and said that we should sit like that for\r\nthe rest of our lives if, of course, I did not become a better girl. In\r\nfact, at first it was impossible to get away from her: I had to work, to\r\nread and to study all beside grandmother. I tried to deceive her once,\r\nand persuaded Fekla to sit in my place. Fekla is our charwoman, she is\r\ndeaf. Fekla sat there instead of me; grandmother was asleep in her\r\narmchair at the time, and I went off to see a friend close by. Well, it\r\nended in trouble. Grandmother woke up while I was out, and asked some\r\nquestions; she thought I was still sitting quietly in my place. Fekla\r\nsaw that grandmother was asking her something, but could not tell what\r\nit was; she wondered what to do, undid the pin and ran away....\"\r\n\r\nAt this point Nastenka stopped and began laughing. I laughed with her.\r\nShe left off at once.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you what, don't you laugh at grandmother. I laugh because it's\r\nfunny.... What can I do, since grandmother is like that; but yet I am\r\nfond of her in a way. Oh, well, I did catch it that time. I had to sit\r\ndown in my place at once, and after that I was not allowed to stir.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I forgot to tell you that our house belongs to us, that is to\r\ngrandmother; it is a little wooden house with three windows as old as\r\ngrandmother herself, with a little upper storey; well, there moved into\r\nour upper storey a new lodger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you had an old lodger,\" I observed casually.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of course,\" answered Nastenka, \"and one who knew how to hold his\r\ntongue better than you do. In fact, he hardly ever used his tongue at\r\nall. He was a dumb, blind, lame, dried-up little old man, so that at\r\nlast he could not go on living, he died; so then we had to find a new\r\nlodger, for we could not live without a lodger--the rent, together with\r\ngrandmother's pension, is almost all we have. But the new lodger, as\r\nluck would have it, was a young man, a stranger not of these parts. As\r\nhe did not haggle over the rent, grandmother accepted him, and only\r\nafterwards she asked me: 'Tell me, Nastenka, what is our lodger like--is\r\nhe young or old?' I did not want to lie, so I told grandmother that he\r\nwasn't exactly young and that he wasn't old.\r\n\r\n\"'And is he pleasant looking?' asked grandmother.\r\n\r\n\"Again I did not want to tell a lie: 'Yes, he is pleasant looking,\r\ngrandmother,' I said. And grandmother said: 'Oh, what a nuisance, what a\r\nnuisance! I tell you this, grandchild, that you may not be looking after\r\nhim. What times these are! Why a paltry lodger like this, and he must be\r\npleasant looking too; it was very different in the old days!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Grandmother was always regretting the old days--she was younger in old\r\ndays, and the sun was warmer in old days, and cream did not turn so sour\r\nin old days--it was always the old days! I would sit still and hold my\r\ntongue and think to myself: why did grandmother suggest it to me? Why\r\ndid she ask whether the lodger was young and good-looking? But that was\r\nall, I just thought it, began counting my stitches again, went on\r\nknitting my stocking, and forgot all about it.\r\n\r\n\"Well, one morning the lodger came in to see us; he asked about a\r\npromise to paper his rooms. One thing led to another. Grandmother was\r\ntalkative, and she said: 'Go, Nastenka, into my bedroom and bring me my\r\nreckoner.' I jumped up at once; I blushed all over, I don't know why,\r\nand forgot I was sitting pinned to grandmother; instead of quietly\r\nundoing the pin, so that the lodger should not see--I jumped so that\r\ngrandmother's chair moved. When I saw that the lodger knew all about me\r\nnow, I blushed, stood still as though I had been shot, and suddenly\r\nbegan to cry--I felt so ashamed and miserable at that minute, that I\r\ndidn't know where to look! Grandmother called out, 'What are you waiting\r\nfor?' and I went on worse than ever. When the lodger saw, saw that I was\r\nashamed on his account, he bowed and went away at once!\r\n\r\n\"After that I felt ready to die at the least sound in the passage. 'It's\r\nthe lodger,' I kept thinking; I stealthily undid the pin in case. But it\r\nalways turned out not to be, he never came. A fortnight passed; the\r\nlodger sent word through Fyokla that he had a great number of French\r\nbooks, and that they were all good books that I might read, so would not\r\ngrandmother like me to read them that I might not be dull? Grandmother\r\nagreed with gratitude, but kept asking if they were moral books, for if\r\nthe books were immoral it would be out of the question, one would learn\r\nevil from them.\"\r\n\r\n\"'And what should I learn, grandmother? What is there written in them?'\r\n\r\n\"'Ah,' she said, 'what's described in them, is how young men seduce\r\nvirtuous girls; how, on the excuse that they want to marry them, they\r\ncarry them off from their parents' houses; how afterwards they leave\r\nthese unhappy girls to their fate, and they perish in the most pitiful\r\nway. I read a great many books,' said grandmother, 'and it is all so\r\nwell described that one sits up all night and reads them on the sly. So\r\nmind you don't read them, Nastenka,' said she. 'What books has he sent?'\r\n\r\n\"'They are all Walter Scott's novels, grandmother.'\r\n\r\n\"'Walter Scott's novels! But stay, isn't there some trick about it?\r\nLook, hasn't he stuck a love-letter among them?'\r\n\r\n\"'No, grandmother,' I said, 'there isn't a love-letter.'\r\n\r\n\"'But look under the binding; they sometimes stuff it under the\r\nbindings, the rascals!'\r\n\r\n\"'No, grandmother, there is nothing under the binding.'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, that's all right.'\r\n\r\n\"So we began reading Walter Scott, and in a month or so we had read\r\nalmost half. Then he sent us more and more. He sent us Pushkin, too; so\r\nthat at last I could not get on without a book and left off dreaming of\r\nhow fine it would be to marry a Chinese Prince.\r\n\r\n\"That's how things were when I chanced one day to meet our lodger on the\r\nstairs. Grandmother had sent me to fetch something. He stopped, I\r\nblushed and he blushed; he laughed, though, said good-morning to me,\r\nasked after grandmother, and said, 'Well, have you read the books?' I\r\nanswered that I had. 'Which did you like best?' he asked. I said,\r\n'Ivanhoe, and Pushkin best of all,' and so our talk ended for that time.\r\n\r\n\"A week later I met him again on the stairs. That time grandmother had\r\nnot sent me, I wanted to get something for myself. It was past two, and\r\nthe lodger used to come home at that time. 'Good-afternoon,' said he. I\r\nsaid good-afternoon, too.\r\n\r\n\"'Aren't you dull,' he said, 'sitting all day with your grandmother?'\r\n\r\n\"When he asked that, I blushed, I don't know why; I felt ashamed, and\r\nagain I felt offended--I suppose because other people had begun to ask\r\nme about that. I wanted to go away without answering, but I hadn't the\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n\"'Listen,' he said, 'you are a good girl. Excuse my speaking to you like\r\nthat, but I assure you that I wish for your welfare quite as much as\r\nyour grandmother. Have you no friends that you could go and visit?'\r\n\r\n\"I told him I hadn't any, that I had had no friend but Mashenka, and she\r\nhad gone away to Pskov.\r\n\r\n\"'Listen,' he said, 'would you like to go to the theatre with me?'\r\n\r\n\"'To the theatre. What about grandmother?'\r\n\r\n\"'But you must go without your grandmother's knowing it,' he said.\r\n\r\n\"'No,' I said, 'I don't want to deceive grandmother. Good-bye.'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, good-bye,' he answered, and said nothing more.\r\n\r\n\"Only after dinner he came to see us; sat a long time talking to\r\ngrandmother; asked her whether she ever went out anywhere, whether she\r\nhad acquaintances, and suddenly said: 'I have taken a box at the opera\r\nfor this evening; they are giving _The Barber of Seville_. My friends\r\nmeant to go, but afterwards refused, so the ticket is left on my hands.'\r\n'_The Barber of Seville_,' cried grandmother; 'why, the same they used\r\nto act in old days?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, it's the same barber,' he said, and glanced at me. I saw what it\r\nmeant and turned crimson, and my heart began throbbing with suspense.\r\n\r\n\"'To be sure, I know it,' said grandmother; 'why, I took the part of\r\nRosina myself in old days, at a private performance!'\r\n\r\n\"'So wouldn't you like to go to-day?' said the lodger. 'Or my ticket\r\nwill be wasted.'\r\n\r\n\"'By all means let us go,' said grandmother; why shouldn't we? And my\r\nNastenka here has never been to the theatre.'\r\n\r\n\"My goodness, what joy! We got ready at once, put on our best clothes,\r\nand set off. Though grandmother was blind, still she wanted to hear the\r\nmusic; besides, she is a kind old soul, what she cared most for was to\r\namuse me, we should never have gone of ourselves.\r\n\r\n\"What my impressions of _The Barber of Seville_ were I won't tell you;\r\nbut all that evening our lodger looked at me so nicely, talked so\r\nnicely, that I saw at once that he had meant to test me in the morning\r\nwhen he proposed that I should go with him alone. Well, it was joy! I\r\nwent to bed so proud, so gay, my heart beat so that I was a little\r\nfeverish, and all night I was raving about _The Barber of Seville_.\r\n\r\n\"I expected that he would come and see us more and more often after\r\nthat, but it wasn't so at all. He almost entirely gave up coming. He\r\nwould just come in about once a month, and then only to invite us to the\r\ntheatre. We went twice again. Only I wasn't at all pleased with that; I\r\nsaw that he was simply sorry for me because I was so hardly treated by\r\ngrandmother, and that was all. As time went on, I grew more and more\r\nrestless, I couldn't sit still, I couldn't read, I couldn't work;\r\nsometimes I laughed and did something to annoy grandmother, at another\r\ntime I would cry. At last I grew thin and was very nearly ill. The opera\r\nseason was over, and our lodger had quite given up coming to see us;\r\nwhenever we met--always on the same staircase, of course--he would bow\r\nso silently, so gravely, as though he did not want to speak, and go down\r\nto the front door, while I went on standing in the middle of the stairs,\r\nas red as a cherry, for all the blood rushed to my head at the sight of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Now the end is near. Just a year ago, in May, the lodger came to us and\r\nsaid to grandmother that he had finished his business here, and that he\r\nmust go back to Moscow for a year. When I heard that, I sank into a\r\nchair half dead; grandmother did not notice anything; and having\r\ninformed us that he should be leaving us, he bowed and went away.\r\n\r\n\"What was I to do? I thought and thought and fretted and fretted, and at\r\nlast I made up my mind. Next day he was to go away, and I made up my\r\nmind to end it all that evening when grandmother went to bed. And so it\r\nhappened. I made up all my clothes in a parcel--all the linen I\r\nneeded--and with the parcel in my hand, more dead than alive, went\r\nupstairs to our lodger. I believe I must have stayed an hour on the\r\nstaircase. When I opened his door he cried out as he looked at me. He\r\nthought I was a ghost, and rushed to give me some water, for I could\r\nhardly stand up. My heart beat so violently that my head ached, and I\r\ndid not know what I was doing. When I recovered I began by laying my\r\nparcel on his bed, sat down beside it, hid my face in my hands and went\r\ninto floods of tears. I think he understood it all at once, and looked\r\nat me so sadly that my heart was torn.\r\n\r\n\"'Listen,' he began, 'listen, Nastenka, I can't do anything; I am a poor\r\nman, for I have nothing, not even a decent berth. How could we live, if\r\nI were to marry you?'\r\n\r\n\"We talked a long time; but at last I got quite frantic, I said I could\r\nnot go on living with grandmother, that I should run away from her, that\r\nI did not want to be pinned to her, and that I would go to Moscow if he\r\nliked, because I could not live without him. Shame and pride and love\r\nwere all clamouring in me at once, and I fell on the bed almost in\r\nconvulsions, I was so afraid of a refusal.\r\n\r\n\"He sat for some minutes in silence, then got up, came up to me and took\r\nme by the hand.\r\n\r\n\"'Listen, my dear good Nastenka, listen; I swear to you that if I am\r\never in a position to marry, you shall make my happiness. I assure you\r\nthat now you are the only one who could make me happy. Listen, I am\r\ngoing to Moscow and shall be there just a year; I hope to establish my\r\nposition. When I come back, if you still love me, I swear that we will\r\nbe happy. Now it is impossible, I am not able, I have not the right to\r\npromise anything. Well, I repeat, if it is not within a year it will\r\ncertainly be some time; that is, of course, if you do not prefer any one\r\nelse, for I cannot and dare not bind you by any sort of promise.'\r\n\r\n\"That was what he said to me, and next day he went away. We agreed\r\ntogether not to say a word to grandmother: that was his wish. Well, my\r\nhistory is nearly finished now. Just a year has past. He has arrived; he\r\nhas been here three days, and, and----\"\r\n\r\n\"And what?\" I cried, impatient to hear the end.\r\n\r\n\"And up to now has not shown himself!\" answered Nastenka, as though\r\nscrewing up all her courage. \"There's no sign or sound of him.\"\r\n\r\nHere she stopped, paused for a minute, bent her head, and covering her\r\nface with her hands broke into such sobs that it sent a pang to my heart\r\nto hear them. I had not in the least expected such a _denouement_.\r\n\r\n\"Nastenka,\" I began timidly in an ingratiating voice, \"Nastenka! For\r\ngoodness' sake don't cry! How do you know? Perhaps he is not here\r\nyet....\"\r\n\r\n\"He is, he is,\" Nastenka repeated. \"He is here, and I know it. We _made\r\nan agreement_ at the time, that evening, before he went away: when we\r\nsaid all that I have told you, and had come to an understanding, then we\r\ncame out here for a walk on this embankment. It was ten o'clock; we sat\r\non this seat. I was not crying then; it was sweet to me to hear what he\r\nsaid.... And he said that he would come to us directly he arrived, and\r\nif I did not refuse him, then we would tell grandmother about it all.\r\nNow he is here, I know it, and yet he does not come!\"\r\n\r\nAnd again she burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\"Good God, can I do nothing to help you in your sorrow?\" I cried jumping\r\nup from the seat in utter despair. \"Tell me, Nastenka, wouldn't it be\r\npossible for me to go to him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Would that be possible?\" she asked suddenly, raising her head.\r\n\r\n\"No, of course not,\" I said pulling myself up; \"but I tell you what,\r\nwrite a letter.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, that's impossible, I can't do that,\" she answered with decision,\r\nbending her head and not looking at me.\r\n\r\n\"How impossible--why is it impossible?\" I went on, clinging to my idea.\r\n\"But, Nastenka, it depends what sort of letter; there are letters and\r\nletters and.... Ah, Nastenka, I am right; trust to me, trust to me, I\r\nwill not give you bad advice. It can all be arranged! You took the first\r\nstep--why not now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't. I can't! It would seem as though I were forcing myself on\r\nhim....\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, my good little Nastenka,\" I said, hardly able to conceal a smile;\r\n\"no, no, you have a right to, in fact, because he made you a promise.\r\nBesides, I can see from everything that he is a man of delicate feeling;\r\nthat he behaved very well,\" I went on, more and more carried away by the\r\nlogic of my own arguments and convictions. \"How did he behave? He bound\r\nhimself by a promise: he said that if he married at all he would marry\r\nno one but you; he gave you full liberty to refuse him at once.... Under\r\nsuch circumstances you may take the first step; you have the right; you\r\nare in the privileged position--if, for instance, you wanted to free him\r\nfrom his promise....\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen; how would you write?\"\r\n\r\n\"Write what?\"\r\n\r\n\"This letter.\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you how I would write: 'Dear Sir.'...\"\r\n\r\n\"Must I really begin like that, 'Dear Sir'?\"\r\n\r\n\"You certainly must! Though, after all, I don't know, I imagine....\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, what next?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Dear Sir,--I must apologize for----' But, no, there's no need to\r\napologize; the fact itself justifies everything. Write simply:--\r\n\r\n \"'I am writing to you. Forgive me my impatience; but I have\r\n been happy for a whole year in hope; am I to blame for being\r\n unable to endure a day of doubt now? Now that you have come,\r\n perhaps you have changed your mind. If so, this letter is to\r\n tell you that I do not repine, nor blame you. I do not blame\r\n you because I have no power over your heart, such is my\r\n fate!\r\n\r\n \"'You are an honourable man. You will not smile or be vexed\r\n at these impatient lines. Remember they are written by a\r\n poor girl; that she is alone; that she has no one to direct\r\n her, no one to advise her, and that she herself could never\r\n control her heart. But forgive me that a doubt has\r\n stolen--if only for one instant--into my heart. You are not\r\n capable of insulting, even in thought, her who so loved and\r\n so loves you.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes; that's exactly what I was thinking!\" cried Nastenka, and her\r\neyes beamed with delight. \"Oh, you have solved my difficulties: God has\r\nsent you to me! Thank you, thank you!\"\r\n\r\n\"What for? What for? For God's sending me?\" I answered, looking\r\ndelighted at her joyful little face. \"Why, yes; for that too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Nastenka! Why, one thanks some people for being alive at the same\r\ntime with one; I thank you for having met me, for my being able to\r\nremember you all my life!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, enough, enough! But now I tell you what, listen: we made an\r\nagreement then that as soon as he arrived he would let me know, by\r\nleaving a letter with some good simple people of my acquaintance who\r\nknow nothing about it; or, if it were impossible to write a letter to\r\nme, for a letter does not always tell everything, he would be here at\r\nten o'clock on the day he arrived, where we had arranged to meet. I know\r\nhe has arrived already; but now it's the third day, and there's no sign\r\nof him and no letter. It's impossible for me to get away from\r\ngrandmother in the morning. Give my letter to-morrow to those kind\r\npeople I spoke to you about: they will send it on to him, and if there\r\nis an answer you bring it to-morrow at ten o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the letter, the letter! You see, you must write the letter first!\r\nSo perhaps it must all be the day after to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"The letter ...\" said Nastenka, a little confused, \"the letter ...\r\nbut....\"\r\n\r\nBut she did not finish. At first she turned her little face away from\r\nme, flushed like a rose, and suddenly I felt in my hand a letter which\r\nhad evidently been written long before, all ready and sealed up. A\r\nfamiliar sweet and charming reminiscence floated through my mind.\r\n\r\n\"R, o--Ro; s, i--si; n, a--na,\" I began.\r\n\r\n\"Rosina!\" we both hummed together; I almost embracing her with delight,\r\nwhile she blushed as only she could blush, and laughed through the tears\r\nwhich gleamed like pearls on her black eyelashes.\r\n\r\n\"Come, enough, enough! Good-bye now,\" she said speaking rapidly. \"Here\r\nis the letter, here is the address to which you are to take it.\r\nGood-bye, till we meet again! Till to-morrow!\"\r\n\r\nShe pressed both my hands warmly, nodded her head, and flew like an\r\narrow down her side street. I stood still for a long time following her\r\nwith my eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Till to-morrow! till to-morrow!\" was ringing in my ears as she vanished\r\nfrom my sight.\r\n\nTHIRD NIGHT\r\n\r\nTo-day was a gloomy, rainy day without a glimmer of sunlight, like the\r\nold age before me. I am oppressed by such strange thoughts, such gloomy\r\nsensations; questions still so obscure to me are crowding into my\r\nbrain--and I seem to have neither power nor will to settle them. It's\r\nnot for me to settle all this!\r\n\r\nTo-day we shall not meet. Yesterday, when we said good-bye, the clouds\r\nbegan gathering over the sky and a mist rose. I said that to-morrow it\r\nwould be a bad day; she made no answer, she did not want to speak\r\nagainst her wishes; for her that day was bright and clear, not one cloud\r\nshould obscure her happiness.\r\n\r\n\"If it rains we shall not see each other,\" she said, \"I shall not come.\"\r\n\r\nI thought that she would not notice to-day's rain, and yet she has not\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nYesterday was our third interview, our third white night....\r\n\r\nBut how fine joy and happiness makes any one! How brimming over with\r\nlove the heart is! One seems longing to pour out one's whole heart; one\r\nwants everything to be gay, everything to be laughing. And how\r\ninfectious that joy is! There was such a softness in her words, such a\r\nkindly feeling in her heart towards me yesterday.... How solicitous and\r\nfriendly she was; how tenderly she tried to give me courage! Oh, the\r\ncoquetry of happiness! While I ... I took it all for the genuine thing,\r\nI thought that she....\r\n\r\nBut, my God, how could I have thought it? How could I have been so\r\nblind, when everything had been taken by another already, when nothing\r\nwas mine; when, in fact, her very tenderness to me, her anxiety, her\r\nlove ... yes, love for me, was nothing else but joy at the thought of\r\nseeing another man so soon, desire to include me, too, in her\r\nhappiness?... When he did not come, when we waited in vain, she frowned,\r\nshe grew timid and discouraged. Her movements, her words, were no longer\r\nso light, so playful, so gay; and, strange to say, she redoubled her\r\nattentiveness to me, as though instinctively desiring to lavish on me\r\nwhat she desired for herself so anxiously, if her wishes were not\r\naccomplished. My Nastenka was so downcast, so dismayed, that I think she\r\nrealized at last that I loved her, and was sorry for my poor love. So\r\nwhen we are unhappy we feel the unhappiness of others more; feeling is\r\nnot destroyed but concentrated....\r\n\r\nI went to meet her with a full heart, and was all impatience. I had no\r\npresentiment that I should feel as I do now, that it would not all end\r\nhappily. She was beaming with pleasure; she was expecting an answer. The\r\nanswer was himself. He was to come, to run at her call. She arrived a\r\nwhole hour before I did. At first she giggled at everything, laughed at\r\nevery word I said. I began talking, but relapsed into silence.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know why I am so glad,\" she said, \"so glad to look at you?--why\r\nI like you so much to-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" I asked, and my heart began throbbing.\r\n\r\n\"I like you because you have not fallen in love with me. You know that\r\nsome men in your place would have been pestering and worrying me, would\r\nhave been sighing and miserable, while you are so nice!\"\r\n\r\nThen she wrung my hand so hard that I almost cried out. She laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Goodness, what a friend you are!\" she began gravely a minute later.\r\n\"God sent you to me. What would have happened to me if you had not been\r\nwith me now? How disinterested you are! How truly you care for me! When\r\nI am married we will be great friends, more than brother and sister; I\r\nshall care almost as I do for him....\"\r\n\r\nI felt horribly sad at that moment, yet something like laughter was\r\nstirring in my soul.\r\n\r\n\"You are very much upset,\" I said; \"you are frightened; you think he\r\nwon't come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh dear!\" she answered; \"if I were less happy, I believe I should cry\r\nat your lack of faith, at your reproaches. However, you have made me\r\nthink and have given me a lot to think about; but I shall think later,\r\nand now I will own that you are right. Yes, I am somehow not myself; I\r\nam all suspense, and feel everything as it were too lightly. But hush!\r\nthat's enough about feelings....\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment we heard footsteps, and in the darkness we saw a figure\r\ncoming towards us. We both started; she almost cried out; I dropped her\r\nhand and made a movement as though to walk away. But we were mistaken,\r\nit was not he.\r\n\r\n\"What are you afraid of? Why did you let go of my hand?\" she said,\r\ngiving it to me again. \"Come, what is it? We will meet him together; I\r\nwant him to see how fond we are of each other.\"\r\n\r\n\"How fond we are of each other!\" I cried. (\"Oh, Nastenka, Nastenka,\" I\r\nthought, \"how much you have told me in that saying! Such fondness at\r\n_certain_ moments makes the heart cold and the soul heavy. Your hand is\r\ncold, mine burns like fire. How blind you are, Nastenka!... Oh, how\r\nunbearable a happy person is sometimes! But I could not be angry with\r\nyou!\")\r\n\r\nAt last my heart was too full.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Nastenka!\" I cried. \"Do you know how it has been with me all\r\nday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, how, how? Tell me quickly! Why have you said nothing all this\r\ntime?\"\r\n\r\n\"To begin with, Nastenka, when I had carried out all your commissions,\r\ngiven the letter, gone to see your good friends, then ... then I went\r\nhome and went to bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that all?\" she interrupted, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, almost all,\" I answered restraining myself, for foolish tears were\r\nalready starting into my eyes. \"I woke an hour before our appointment,\r\nand yet, as it were, I had not been asleep. I don't know what happened\r\nto me. I came to tell you all about it, feeling as though time were\r\nstanding still, feeling as though one sensation, one feeling must remain\r\nwith me from that time for ever; feeling as though one minute must go on\r\nfor all eternity, and as though all life had come to a standstill for\r\nme.... When I woke up it seemed as though some musical motive long\r\nfamiliar, heard somewhere in the past, forgotten and voluptuously sweet,\r\nhad come back to me now. It seemed to me that it had been clamouring at\r\nmy heart all my life, and only now....\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh my goodness, my goodness,\" Nastenka interrupted, \"what does all that\r\nmean? I don't understand a word.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Nastenka, I wanted somehow to convey to you that strange\r\nimpression....\" I began in a plaintive voice, in which there still lay\r\nhid a hope, though a very faint one.\r\n\r\n\"Leave off. Hush!\" she said, and in one instant the sly puss had\r\nguessed.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she became extraordinarily talkative, gay, mischievous; she\r\ntook my arm, laughed, wanted me to laugh too, and every confused word I\r\nuttered evoked from her prolonged ringing laughter.... I began to feel\r\nangry, she had suddenly begun flirting.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know,\" she began, \"I feel a little vexed that you are not in\r\nlove with me? There's no understanding human nature! But all the same,\r\nMr. Unapproachable, you cannot blame me for being so simple; I tell you\r\neverything, everything, whatever foolish thought comes into my head.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen! That's eleven, I believe,\" I said as the slow chime of a bell\r\nrang out from a distant tower. She suddenly stopped, left off laughing\r\nand began to count.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it's eleven,\" she said at last in a timid, uncertain voice.\r\n\r\nI regretted at once that I had frightened her, making her count the\r\nstrokes, and I cursed myself for my spiteful impulse; I felt sorry for\r\nher, and did not know how to atone for what I had done.\r\n\r\nI began comforting her, seeking for reasons for his not coming,\r\nadvancing various arguments, proofs. No one could have been easier to\r\ndeceive than she was at that moment; and, indeed, any one at such a\r\nmoment listens gladly to any consolation, whatever it may be, and is\r\noverjoyed if a shadow of excuse can be found.\r\n\r\n\"And indeed it's an absurd thing,\" I began, warming to my task and\r\nadmiring the extraordinary clearness of my argument, \"why, he could not\r\nhave come; you have muddled and confused me, Nastenka, so that I too,\r\nhave lost count of the time.... Only think: he can scarcely have\r\nreceived the letter; suppose he is not able to come, suppose he is going\r\nto answer the letter, could not come before to-morrow. I will go for it\r\nas soon as it's light to-morrow and let you know at once. Consider,\r\nthere are thousands of possibilities; perhaps he was not at home when\r\nthe letter came, and may not have read it even now! Anything may happen,\r\nyou know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes!\" said Nastenka. \"I did not think of that. Of course anything\r\nmay happen?\" she went on in a tone that offered no opposition, though\r\nsome other far-away thought could be heard like a vexatious discord in\r\nit. \"I tell you what you must do,\" she said, \"you go as early as\r\npossible to-morrow morning, and if you get anything let me know at once.\r\nYou know where I live, don't you?\"\r\n\r\nAnd she began repeating her address to me.\r\n\r\nThen she suddenly became so tender, so solicitous with me. She seemed to\r\nlisten attentively to what I told her; but when I asked her some\r\nquestion she was silent, was confused, and turned her head away. I\r\nlooked into her eyes--yes, she was crying.\r\n\r\n\"How can you? How can you? Oh, what a baby you are! what\r\nchildishness!... Come, come!\"\r\n\r\nShe tried to smile, to calm herself, but her chin was quivering and her\r\nbosom was still heaving.\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking about you,\" she said after a minute's silence. \"You are\r\nso kind that I should be a stone if I did not feel it. Do you know what\r\nhas occurred to me now? I was comparing you two. Why isn't he you? Why\r\nisn't he like you? He is not as good as you, though I love him more than\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nI made no answer. She seemed to expect me to say something.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, it may be that I don't understand him fully yet. You know I\r\nwas always as it were afraid of him; he was always so grave, as it were\r\nso proud. Of course I know it's only that he seems like that, I know\r\nthere is more tenderness in his heart than in mine.... I remember how he\r\nlooked at me when I went in to him--do you remember?--with my bundle;\r\nbut yet I respect him too much, and doesn't that show that we are not\r\nequals?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Nastenka, no,\" I answered, \"it shows that you love him more than\r\nanything in the world, and far more than yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, supposing that is so,\" answered Nastenka naively. \"But do you know\r\nwhat strikes me now? Only I am not talking about him now, but speaking\r\ngenerally; all this came into my mind some time ago. Tell me, how is it\r\nthat we can't all be like brothers together? Why is it that even the\r\nbest of men always seem to hide something from other people and to keep\r\nsomething back? Why not say straight out what is in one's heart, when\r\none knows that one is not speaking idly? As it is every one seems\r\nharsher than he really is, as though all were afraid of doing injustice\r\nto their feelings, by being too quick to express them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Nastenka, what you say is true; but there are many reasons for\r\nthat,\" I broke in suppressing my own feelings at that moment more than\r\never.\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" she answered with deep feeling. \"Here you, for instance, are\r\nnot like other people! I really don't know how to tell you what I feel;\r\nbut it seems to me that you, for instance ... at the present moment ...\r\nit seems to me that you are sacrificing something for me,\" she added\r\ntimidly, with a fleeting glance at me. \"Forgive me for saying so, I am a\r\nsimple girl you know. I have seen very little of life, and I really\r\nsometimes don't know how to say things,\" she added in a voice that\r\nquivered with some hidden feeling, while she tried to smile; \"but I only\r\nwanted to tell you that I am grateful, that I feel it all too.... Oh,\r\nmay God give you happiness for it! What you told me about your dreamer\r\nis quite untrue now--that is, I mean, it's not true of you. You are\r\nrecovering, you are quite a different man from what you described. If\r\nyou ever fall in love with some one, God give you happiness with her! I\r\nwon't wish anything for her, for she will be happy with you. I know, I\r\nam a woman myself, so you must believe me when I tell you so.\"\r\n\r\nShe ceased speaking, and pressed my hand warmly. I too could not speak\r\nwithout emotion. Some minutes passed.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it's clear he won't come to-night,\" she said at last raising her\r\nhead. \"It's late.\"\r\n\r\n\"He will come to-morrow,\" I said in the most firm and convincing tone.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she added with no sign of her former depression. \"I see for\r\nmyself now that he could not come till to-morrow. Well, good-bye, till\r\nto-morrow. If it rains perhaps I shall not come. But the day after\r\nto-morrow, I shall come. I shall come for certain, whatever happens; be\r\nsure to be here, I want to see you, I will tell you everything.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then when we parted she gave me her hand and said, looking at me\r\ncandidly: \"We shall always be together, shan't we?\"\r\n\r\nOh, Nastenka, Nastenka! If only you knew how lonely I am now!\r\n\r\nAs soon as it struck nine o'clock I could not stay indoors, but put on\r\nmy things, and went out in spite of the weather. I was there, sitting on\r\nour seat. I went to her street, but I felt ashamed, and turned back\r\nwithout looking at their windows, when I was two steps from her door. I\r\nwent home more depressed than I had ever been before. What a damp,\r\ndreary day! If it had been fine I should have walked about all night....\r\n\r\nBut to-morrow, to-morrow! To-morrow she will tell me everything. The\r\nletter has not come to-day, however. But that was to be expected. They\r\nare together by now....\r\n\nFOURTH NIGHT\r\n\r\nMy God, how it has all ended! What it has all ended in! I arrived at\r\nnine o'clock. She was already there. I noticed her a good way off; she\r\nwas standing as she had been that first time, with her elbows on the\r\nrailing, and she did not hear me coming up to her.\r\n\r\n\"Nastenka!\" I called to her, suppressing my agitation with an effort.\r\n\r\nShe turned to me quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" she said. \"Well? Make haste!\"\r\n\r\nI looked at her in perplexity.\r\n\r\n\"Well, where is the letter? Have you brought the letter?\" she repeated\r\nclutching at the railing.\r\n\r\n\"No, there is no letter,\" I said at last. \"Hasn't he been to you yet?\"\r\nShe turned fearfully pale and looked at me for a long time without\r\nmoving. I had shattered her last hope.\r\n\r\n\"Well, God be with him,\" she said at last in a breaking voice; \"God be\r\nwith him if he leaves me like that.\"\r\n\r\nShe dropped her eyes, then tried to look at me and could not. For\r\nseveral minutes she was struggling with her emotion. All at once she\r\nturned away, leaning her elbows against the railing and burst into\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n\"Oh don't, don't!\" I began; but looking at her I had not the heart to go\r\non, and what was I to say to her?\r\n\r\n\"Don't try and comfort me,\" she said; \"don't talk about him; don't tell\r\nme that he will come, that he has not cast me off so cruelly and so\r\ninhumanly as he has. What for--what for? Can there have been something\r\nin my letter, that unlucky letter?\"\r\n\r\nAt that point sobs stifled her voice; my heart was torn as I looked at\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how inhumanly cruel it is!\" she began again. \"And not a line, not a\r\nline! He might at least have written that he does not want me, that he\r\nrejects me--but not a line for three days! How easy it is for him to\r\nwound, to insult a poor, defenceless girl, whose only fault is that she\r\nloves him! Oh, what I've suffered during these three days! Oh, dear!\r\nWhen I think that I was the first to go to him, that I humbled myself\r\nbefore him, cried, that I begged of him a little love!... and after\r\nthat! Listen,\" she said, turning to me, and her black eyes flashed, \"it\r\nisn't so! It can't be so; it isn't natural. Either you are mistaken or\r\nI; perhaps he has not received the letter? Perhaps he still knows\r\nnothing about it? How could any one--judge for yourself, tell me, for\r\ngoodness' sake explain it to me, I can't understand it--how could any\r\none behave with such barbarous coarseness as he has behaved to me? Not\r\none word! Why, the lowest creature on earth is treated more\r\ncompassionately. Perhaps he has heard something, perhaps some one has\r\ntold him something about me,\" she cried, turning to me inquiringly:\r\n\"What do you think?\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Nastenka, I shall go to him to-morrow in your name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will question him about everything; I will tell him everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"You write a letter. Don't say no, Nastenka, don't say no! I will make\r\nhim respect your action, he shall hear all about it, and if----\"\r\n\r\n\"No, my friend, no,\" she interrupted. \"Enough! Not another word, not\r\nanother line from me--enough! I don't know him; I don't love him any\r\nmore. I will ... forget him.\"\r\n\r\nShe could not go on.\r\n\r\n\"Calm yourself, calm yourself! Sit here, Nastenka,\" I said, making her\r\nsit down on the seat.\r\n\r\n\"I am calm. Don't trouble. It's nothing! It's only tears, they will soon\r\ndry. Why, do you imagine I shall do away with myself, that I shall throw\r\nmyself into the river?\"\r\n\r\nMy heart was full: I tried to speak, but I could not.\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" she said taking my hand. \"Tell me: you wouldn't have behaved\r\nlike this, would you? You would not have abandoned a girl who had come\r\nto you of herself, you would not have thrown into her face a shameless\r\ntaunt at her weak foolish heart? You would have taken care of her? You\r\nwould have realized that she was alone, that she did not know how to\r\nlook after herself, that she could not guard herself from loving you,\r\nthat it was not her fault, not her fault--that she had done nothing....\r\nOh dear, oh dear!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nastenka!\" I cried at last, unable to control my emotion. \"Nastenka,\r\nyou torture me! You wound my heart, you are killing me, Nastenka! I\r\ncannot be silent! I must speak at last, give utterance to what is\r\nsurging in my heart!\"\r\n\r\nAs I said this I got up from the seat. She took my hand and looked at me\r\nin surprise.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter with you?\" she said at last.\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" I said resolutely. \"Listen to me, Nastenka! What I am going to\r\nsay to you now is all nonsense, all impossible, all stupid! I know that\r\nthis can never be, but I cannot be silent. For the sake of what you are\r\nsuffering now, I beg you beforehand to forgive me!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it? What is it?\" she said drying her tears and looking at me\r\nintently, while a strange curiosity gleamed in her astonished eyes.\r\n\"What is the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's impossible, but I love you, Nastenka! There it is! Now everything\r\nis told,\" I said with a wave of my hand. \"Now you will see whether you\r\ncan go on talking to me as you did just now, whether you can listen to\r\nwhat I am going to say to you.\"...\r\n\r\n\"Well, what then?\" Nastenka interrupted me. \"What of it? I knew you\r\nloved me long ago, only I always thought that you simply liked me very\r\nmuch.... Oh dear, oh dear!\"\r\n\r\n\"At first it was simply liking, Nastenka, but now, now! I am just in the\r\nsame position as you were when you went to him with your bundle. In a\r\nworse position than you, Nastenka, because he cared for no one else as\r\nyou do.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you saying to me! I don't understand you in the least. But\r\ntell me, what's this for; I don't mean what for, but why are you ... so\r\nsuddenly.... Oh dear, I am talking nonsense! But you....\"\r\n\r\nAnd Nastenka broke off in confusion. Her cheeks flamed; she dropped her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\"What's to be done, Nastenka, what am I to do? I am to blame. I have\r\nabused your.... But no, no, I am not to blame, Nastenka; I feel that, I\r\nknow that, because my heart tells me I am right, for I cannot hurt you\r\nin any way, I cannot wound you! I was your friend, but I am still your\r\nfriend, I have betrayed no trust. Here my tears are falling, Nastenka.\r\nLet them flow, let them flow--they don't hurt anybody. They will dry,\r\nNastenka.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sit down, sit down,\" she said, making me sit down on the seat. \"Oh, my\r\nGod!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Nastenka, I won't sit down; I cannot stay here any longer, you\r\ncannot see me again; I will tell you everything and go away. I only want\r\nto say that you would never have found out that I loved you. I should\r\nhave kept my secret. I would not have worried you at such a moment with\r\nmy egoism. No! But I could not resist it now; you spoke of it yourself,\r\nit is your fault, your fault and not mine. You cannot drive me away from\r\nyou.\"...\r\n\r\n\"No, no, I don't drive you away, no!\" said Nastenka, concealing her\r\nconfusion as best she could, poor child.\r\n\r\n\"You don't drive me away? No! But I meant to run from you myself. I will\r\ngo away, but first I will tell you all, for when you were crying here I\r\ncould not sit unmoved, when you wept, when you were in torture at\r\nbeing--at being--I will speak of it, Nastenka--at being forsaken, at\r\nyour love being repulsed, I felt that in my heart there was so much love\r\nfor you, Nastenka, so much love! And it seemed so bitter that I could\r\nnot help you with my love, that my heart was breaking and I ... I could\r\nnot be silent, I had to speak, Nastenka, I had to speak!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes! tell me, talk to me,\" said Nastenka with an indescribable\r\ngesture. \"Perhaps you think it strange that I talk to you like this, but\r\n... speak! I will tell you afterwards! I will tell you everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are sorry for me, Nastenka, you are simply sorry for me, my dear\r\nlittle friend! What's done can't be mended. What is said cannot be taken\r\nback. Isn't that so? Well, now you know. That's the starting-point. Very\r\nwell. Now it's all right, only listen. When you were sitting crying I\r\nthought to myself (oh, let me tell you what I was thinking!), I thought,\r\nthat (of course it cannot be, Nastenka), I thought that you ... I\r\nthought that you somehow ... quite apart from me, had ceased to love\r\nhim. Then--I thought that yesterday and the day before yesterday,\r\nNastenka--then I would--I certainly would--have succeeded in making you\r\nlove me; you know, you said yourself, Nastenka, that you almost loved\r\nme. Well, what next? Well, that's nearly all I wanted to tell you; all\r\nthat is left to say is how it would be if you loved me, only that,\r\nnothing more! Listen, my friend--for any way you are my friend--I am, of\r\ncourse, a poor, humble man, of no great consequence; but that's not the\r\npoint (I don't seem to be able to say what I mean, Nastenka, I am so\r\nconfused), only I would love you, I would love you so, that even if you\r\nstill loved him, even if you went on loving the man I don't know, you\r\nwould never feel that my love was a burden to you. You would only feel\r\nevery minute that at your side was beating a grateful, grateful heart, a\r\nwarm heart ready for your sake.... Oh Nastenka, Nastenka! What have you\r\ndone to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't cry; I don't want you to cry,\" said Nastenka getting up quickly\r\nfrom the seat. \"Come along, get up, come with me, don't cry, don't cry,\"\r\nshe said, drying her tears with her handkerchief; \"let us go now; maybe\r\nI will tell you something.... If he has forsaken me now, if he has\r\nforgotten me, though I still love him (I do not want to deceive you) ...\r\nbut listen, answer me. If I were to love you, for instance, that is, if\r\nI only.... Oh my friend, my friend! To think, to think how I wounded\r\nyou, when I laughed at your love, when I praised you for not falling in\r\nlove with me. Oh dear! How was it I did not foresee this, how was it I\r\ndid not foresee this, how could I have been so stupid? But.... Well, I\r\nhave made up my mind, I will tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Nastenka, do you know what? I'll go away, that's what I'll\r\ndo. I am simply tormenting you. Here you are remorseful for having\r\nlaughed at me, and I won't have you ... in addition to your sorrow....\r\nOf course it is my fault, Nastenka, but good-bye!\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay, listen to me: can you wait?\"\r\n\r\n\"What for? How?\"\r\n\r\n\"I love him; but I shall get over it, I must get over it, I cannot fail\r\nto get over it; I am getting over it, I feel that.... Who knows? Perhaps\r\nit will all end to-day, for I hate him, for he has been laughing at me,\r\nwhile you have been weeping here with me, for you have not repulsed me\r\nas he has, for you love me while he has never loved me, for in fact, I\r\nlove you myself.... Yes, I love you! I love you as you love me; I have\r\ntold you so before, you heard it yourself--I love you because you are\r\nbetter than he is, because you are nobler than he is, because, because\r\nhe----\"\r\n\r\nThe poor girl's emotion was so violent that she could not say more; she\r\nlaid her head upon my shoulder, then upon my bosom, and wept bitterly. I\r\ncomforted her, I persuaded her, but she could not stop crying; she kept\r\npressing my hand, and saying between her sobs: \"Wait, wait, it will be\r\nover in a minute! I want to tell you ... you mustn't think that these\r\ntears--it's nothing, it's weakness, wait till it's over.\"... At last she\r\nleft off crying, dried her eyes and we walked on again. I wanted to\r\nspeak, but she still begged me to wait. We were silent.... At last she\r\nplucked up courage and began to speak.\r\n\r\n\"It's like this,\" she began in a weak and quivering voice, in which,\r\nhowever, there was a note that pierced my heart with a sweet pang;\r\n\"don't think that I am so light and inconstant, don't think that I can\r\nforget and change so quickly. I have loved him for a whole year, and I\r\nswear by God that I have never, never, even in thought, been unfaithful\r\nto him.... He has despised me, he has been laughing at me--God forgive\r\nhim! But he has insulted me and wounded my heart. I ... I do not love\r\nhim, for I can only love what is magnanimous, what understands me, what\r\nis generous; for I am like that myself and he is not worthy of me--well,\r\nthat's enough of him. He has done better than if he had deceived my\r\nexpectations later, and shown me later what he was.... Well, it's over!\r\nBut who knows, my dear friend,\" she went on pressing my hand, \"who\r\nknows, perhaps my whole love was a mistaken feeling, a delusion--perhaps\r\nit began in mischief, in nonsense, because I was kept so strictly by\r\ngrandmother? Perhaps I ought to love another man, not him, a different\r\nman, who would have pity on me and ... and.... But don't let us say any\r\nmore about that,\" Nastenka broke off, breathless with emotion, \"I only\r\nwanted to tell you ... I wanted to tell you that if, although I love him\r\n(no, did love him), if, in spite of this you still say.... If you feel\r\nthat your love is so great that it may at last drive from my heart my\r\nold feeling--if you will have pity on me--if you do not want to leave me\r\nalone to my fate, without hope, without consolation--if you are ready to\r\nlove me always as you do now--I swear to you that gratitude ... that my\r\nlove will be at last worthy of your love.... Will you take my hand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nastenka!\" I cried breathless with sobs. \"Nastenka, oh Nastenka!\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough, enough! Well, now it's quite enough,\" she said, hardly able to\r\ncontrol herself. \"Well, now all has been said, hasn't it! Hasn't it? You\r\nare happy--I am happy too. Not another word about it, wait; spare me ...\r\ntalk of something else, for God's sake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Nastenka, yes! Enough about that, now I am happy. I---- Yes,\r\nNastenka, yes, let us talk of other things, let us make haste and talk.\r\nYes! I am ready.\"\r\n\r\nAnd we did not know what to say: we laughed, we wept, we said thousands\r\nof things meaningless and incoherent; at one moment we walked along the\r\npavement, then suddenly turned back and crossed the road; then we\r\nstopped and went back again to the embankment; we were like children.\r\n\r\n\"I am living alone now, Nastenka,\" I began, \"but to-morrow! Of course\r\nyou know, Nastenka, I am poor, I have only got twelve hundred roubles,\r\nbut that doesn't matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not, and granny has her pension, so she will be no burden. We\r\nmust take granny.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course we must take granny. But there's Matrona.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and we've got Fyokla too!\"\r\n\r\n\"Matrona is a good woman, but she has one fault: she has no imagination,\r\nNastenka, absolutely none; but that doesn't matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right--they can live together; only you must move to us\r\nto-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"To you? How so? All right, I am ready.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, hire a room from us. We have a top floor, it's empty. We had an\r\nold lady lodging there, but she has gone away; and I know granny would\r\nlike to have a young man. I said to her, 'Why a young man?' And she\r\nsaid, 'Oh, because I am old; only don't you fancy, Nastenka, that I want\r\nhim as a husband for you.' So I guessed it was with that idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Nastenka!\"\r\n\r\nAnd we both laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Come, that's enough, that's enough. But where do you live? I've\r\nforgotten.\"\r\n\r\n\"Over that way, near X bridge, Barannikov's Buildings.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's that big house?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that big house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I know, a nice house; only you know you had better give it up and\r\ncome to us as soon as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow, Nastenka, to-morrow; I owe a little for my rent there but\r\nthat doesn't matter. I shall soon get my salary.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you know I will perhaps give lessons; I will learn something\r\nmyself and then give lessons.\"\r\n\r\n\"Capital! And I shall soon get a bonus.\"\r\n\r\n\"So by to-morrow you will be my lodger.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we will go to _The Barber of Seville_, for they are soon going to\r\ngive it again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we'll go,\" said Nastenka, \"but better see something else and not\r\n_The Barber of Seville_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, something else. Of course that will be better, I did not\r\nthink----\"\r\n\r\nAs we talked like this we walked along in a sort of delirium, a sort of\r\nintoxication, as though we did not know what was happening to us. At one\r\nmoment we stopped and talked for a long time at the same place; then we\r\nwent on again, and goodness knows where we went; and again tears and\r\nagain laughter. All of a sudden Nastenka would want to go home, and I\r\nwould not dare to detain her but would want to see her to the house; we\r\nset off, and in a quarter of an hour found ourselves at the embankment\r\nby our seat. Then she would sigh, and tears would come into her eyes\r\nagain; I would turn chill with dismay.... But she would press my hand\r\nand force me to walk, to talk, to chatter as before.\r\n\r\n\"It's time I was home at last; I think it must be very late,\" Nastenka\r\nsaid at last. \"We must give over being childish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Nastenka, only I shan't sleep to-night; I am not going home.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I shall sleep either; only see me home.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think so!\"\r\n\r\n\"Only this time we really must get to the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must, we must.\"\r\n\r\n\"Honour bright? For you know one must go home some time!\"\r\n\r\n\"Honour bright,\" I answered laughing.\r\n\r\n\"Well, come along!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come along! Look at the sky, Nastenka. Look! To-morrow it will be a\r\nlovely day; what a blue sky, what a moon! Look; that yellow cloud is\r\ncovering it now, look, look! No, it has passed by. Look, look!\"\r\n\r\nBut Nastenka did not look at the cloud; she stood mute as though turned\r\nto stone; a minute later she huddled timidly close up to me. Her hand\r\ntrembled in my hand; I looked at her. She pressed still more closely to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nAt that moment a young man passed by us. He suddenly stopped, looked at\r\nus intently, and then again took a few steps on. My heart began\r\nthrobbing.\r\n\r\n\"Who is it, Nastenka?\" I said in an undertone.\r\n\r\n\"It's he,\" she answered in a whisper, huddling up to me, still more\r\nclosely, still more tremulously.... I could hardly stand on my feet.\r\n\r\n\"Nastenka, Nastenka! It's you!\" I heard a voice behind us and at the\r\nsame moment the young man took several steps towards us.\r\n\r\nMy God, how she cried out! How she started! How she tore herself out of\r\nmy arms and rushed to meet him! I stood and looked at them, utterly\r\ncrushed. But she had hardly given him her hand, had hardly flung herself\r\ninto his arms, when she turned to me again, was beside me again in a\r\nflash, and before I knew where I was she threw both arms round my neck\r\nand gave me a warm, tender kiss. Then, without saying a word to me, she\r\nrushed back to him again, took his hand, and drew him after her.\r\n\r\nI stood a long time looking after them. At last the two vanished from my\r\nsight.\r\n\nMORNING\r\n\r\nMy night ended with the morning. It was a wet day. The rain was falling\r\nand beating disconsolately upon my window pane; it was dark in the room\r\nand grey outside. My head ached and I was giddy; fever was stealing over\r\nmy limbs.\r\n\r\n\"There's a letter for you, sir; the postman brought it,\" Matrona said\r\nstooping over me.\r\n\r\n\"A letter? From whom?\" I cried jumping up from my chair.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, sir, better look--maybe it is written there whom it is\r\nfrom.\"\r\n\r\nI broke the seal. It was from her!\r\n\r\n * * * * *\r\n\r\n\"Oh, forgive me, forgive me! I beg you on my knees to forgive me! I\r\ndeceived you and myself. It was a dream, a mirage.... My heart aches for\r\nyou to-day; forgive me, forgive me!\r\n\r\n\"Don't blame me, for I have not changed to you in the least. I told you\r\nthat I would love you, I love you now, I more than love you. Oh, my God!\r\nIf only I could love you both at once! Oh, if only you were he!\"\r\n\r\n[\"Oh, if only he were you,\" echoed in my mind. I remembered your words,\r\nNastenka!]\r\n\r\n\"God knows what I would do for you now! I know that you are sad and\r\ndreary. I have wounded you, but you know when one loves a wrong is soon\r\nforgotten. And you love me.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, yes, thank you for that love! For it will live in my memory\r\nlike a sweet dream which lingers long after awakening; for I shall\r\nremember for ever that instant when you opened your heart to me like a\r\nbrother and so generously accepted the gift of my shattered heart to\r\ncare for it, nurse it, and heal it.... If you forgive me, the memory of\r\nyou will be exalted by a feeling of everlasting gratitude which will\r\nnever be effaced from my soul.... I will treasure that memory: I will be\r\ntrue to it, I will not betray it, I will not betray my heart: it is too\r\nconstant. It returned so quickly yesterday to him to whom it has always\r\nbelonged.\r\n\r\n\"We shall meet, you will come to us, you will not leave us, you will be\r\nfor ever a friend, a brother to me. And when you see me you will give me\r\nyour hand ... yes? You will give it to me, you have forgiven me, haven't\r\nyou? You love me _as before_?\r\n\r\n\"Oh, love me, do not forsake me, because I love you so at this moment,\r\nbecause I am worthy of your love, because I will deserve it ... my dear!\r\nNext week I am to be married to him. He has come back in love, he has\r\nnever forgotten me. You will not be angry at my writing about him. But I\r\nwant to come and see you with him; you will like him, won't you?\r\n\r\n \"Forgive me, remember and love your\r\n \"NASTENKA.\"\r\n\r\n * * * * *\r\n\r\nI read that letter over and over again for a long time; tears gushed to\r\nmy eyes. At last it fell from my hands and I hid my face.\r\n\r\n\"Dearie! I say, dearie----\" Matrona began.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Matrona?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have taken all the cobwebs off the ceiling; you can have a wedding or\r\ngive a party.\"\r\n\r\nI looked at Matrona. She was still a hearty, _youngish_ old woman, but I\r\ndon't know why all at once I suddenly pictured her with lustreless eyes,\r\na wrinkled face, bent, decrepit.... I don't know why I suddenly pictured\r\nmy room grown old like Matrona. The walls and the floors looked\r\ndiscoloured, everything seemed dingy; the spiders' webs were thicker\r\nthan ever. I don't know why, but when I looked out of the window it\r\nseemed to me that the house opposite had grown old and dingy too, that\r\nthe stucco on the columns was peeling off and crumbling, that the\r\ncornices were cracked and blackened, and that the walls, of a vivid deep\r\nyellow, were patchy.\r\n\r\nEither the sunbeams suddenly peeping out from the clouds for a moment\r\nwere hidden again behind a veil of rain, and everything had grown dingy\r\nagain before my eyes; or perhaps the whole vista of my future flashed\r\nbefore me so sad and forbidding, and I saw myself just as I was now,\r\nfifteen years hence, older, in the same room, just as solitary, with the\r\nsame Matrona grown no cleverer for those fifteen years.\r\n\r\nBut to imagine that I should bear you a grudge, Nastenka! That I should\r\ncast a dark cloud over your serene, untroubled happiness; that by my\r\nbitter reproaches I should cause distress to your heart, should poison\r\nit with secret remorse and should force it to throb with anguish at the\r\nmoment of bliss; that I should crush a single one of those tender\r\nblossoms which you have twined in your dark tresses when you go with him\r\nto the altar.... Oh never, never! May your sky be clear, may your sweet\r\nsmile be bright and untroubled, and may you be blessed for that moment\r\nof blissful happiness which you gave to another, lonely and grateful\r\nheart!\r\n\r\nMy God, a whole moment of happiness! Is that too little for the whole of\r\na man's life?\r\n\n NOTES FROM UNDERGROUND[1]\r\n A NOVEL\r\n\r\n PART I\r\n UNDERGROUND\r\n\nI\r\n\r\nI am a sick man.... I am a spiteful man. I am an unattractive man. I\r\nbelieve my liver is diseased. However, I know nothing at all about my\r\ndisease, and do not know for certain what ails me. I don't consult a\r\ndoctor for it, and never have, though I have a respect for medicine and\r\ndoctors. Besides, I am extremely superstitious, sufficiently so to\r\nrespect medicine, anyway (I am well-educated enough not to be\r\nsuperstitious, but I am superstitious). No, I refuse to consult a doctor\r\nfrom spite. That you probably will not understand. Well, I understand\r\nit, though. Of course, I can't explain who it is precisely that I am\r\nmortifying in this case by my spite: I am perfectly well aware that I\r\ncannot \"pay out\" the doctors by not consulting them; I know better than\r\nany one that by all this I am only injuring myself and no one else. But\r\nstill, if I don't consult a doctor it is from spite. My liver is bad,\r\nwell--let it get worse!\r\n\r\n [Footnote 1: The author of the diary and the diary itself\r\n are, of course, imaginary. Nevertheless it is clear that\r\n such persons as the writer of these notes not only may, but\r\n positively must, exist in our society, when we consider the\r\n circumstances in the midst of which our society is formed. I\r\n have tried to expose to the view of the public more\r\n distinctly than is commonly done, one of the characters of\r\n the recent past. He is one of the representatives of a\r\n generation still living. In this fragment, entitled\r\n \"Underground,\" this person introduces himself and his views,\r\n and, as it were, tries to explain the causes owing to which\r\n he has made his appearance and was bound to make his\r\n appearance in our midst. In the second fragment there are\r\n added the actual notes of this person concerning certain\r\n events in his life.--AUTHOR'S NOTE.]\r\n\r\nI have been going on like that for a long time--twenty years. Now I am\r\nforty. I used to be in the government service, but am no longer. I was a\r\nspiteful official. I was rude and took pleasure in being so. I did not\r\ntake bribes, you see, so I was bound to find a recompense in that, at\r\nleast. (A poor jest, but I will not scratch it out. I wrote it thinking\r\nit would sound very witty; but now that I have seen myself that I only\r\nwanted to show off in a despicable way, I will not scratch it out on\r\npurpose!)\r\n\r\nWhen petitioners used to come for information to the table at which I\r\nsat, I used to grind my teeth at them, and felt intense enjoyment when I\r\nsucceeded in making anybody unhappy. I almost always did succeed. For\r\nthe most part they were all timid people--of course, they were\r\npetitioners. But of the uppish ones there was one officer in particular\r\nI could not endure. He simply would not be humble, and clanked his sword\r\nin a disgusting way. I carried on a feud with him for eighteen months\r\nover that sword. At last I got the better of him. He left off clanking\r\nit. That happened in my youth, though.\r\n\r\nBut do you know, gentlemen, what was the chief point about my spite?\r\nWhy, the whole point, the real sting of it lay in the fact that\r\ncontinually, even in the moment of the acutest spleen, I was inwardly\r\nconscious with shame that I was not only not a spiteful but not even an\r\nembittered man, that I was simply scaring sparrows at random and amusing\r\nmyself by it. I might foam at the mouth, but bring me a doll to play\r\nwith, give me a cup of tea with sugar in it, and maybe I should be\r\nappeased. I might even be genuinely touched, though probably I should\r\ngrind my teeth at myself afterwards and lie awake at night with shame\r\nfor months after. That was my way.\r\n\r\nI was lying when I said just now that I was a spiteful official. I was\r\nlying from spite. I was simply amusing myself with the petitioners and\r\nwith the officer, and in reality I never could become spiteful. I was\r\nconscious every moment in myself of many, very many elements absolutely\r\nopposite to that. I felt them positively swarming in me, these opposite\r\nelements. I knew that they had been swarming in me all my life and\r\ncraving some outlet from me, but I would not let them, would not let\r\nthem, purposely would not let them come out. They tormented me till I\r\nwas ashamed: they drove me to convulsions and--sickened me, at last, how\r\nthey sickened me! Now, are not you fancying, gentlemen, that I am\r\nexpressing remorse for something now, that I am asking your forgiveness\r\nfor something? I am sure you are fancying that.... However, I assure you\r\nI do not care if you are....\r\n\r\nIt was not only that I could not become spiteful, I did not know how to\r\nbecome anything: neither spiteful nor kind, neither a rascal nor an\r\nhonest man, neither a hero nor an insect. Now, I am living out my life\r\nin my corner, taunting myself with the spiteful and useless consolation\r\nthat an intelligent man cannot become anything seriously, and it is only\r\nthe fool who becomes anything. Yes, a man in the nineteenth century must\r\nand morally ought to be pre-eminently a characterless creature; a man of\r\ncharacter, an active man is pre-eminently a limited creature. That is my\r\nconviction of forty years. I am forty years old now, and you know forty\r\nyears is a whole life-time; you know it is extreme old age. To live\r\nlonger than forty years is bad manners, is vulgar, immoral. Who does\r\nlive beyond forty? Answer that, sincerely and honestly. I will tell you\r\nwho do: fools and worthless fellows. I tell all old men that to their\r\nface, all these venerable old men, all these silver-haired and reverend\r\nseniors! I tell the whole world that to its face! I have a right to say\r\nso, for I shall go on living to sixty myself. To seventy! To eighty!...\r\nStay, let me take breath....\r\n\r\nYou imagine no doubt, gentlemen, that I want to amuse you. You are\r\nmistaken in that, too. I am by no means such a mirthful person as you\r\nimagine, or as you may imagine; however, irritated by all this babble\r\n(and I feel that you are irritated) you think fit to ask me who am\r\nI--then my answer is, I am a collegiate assessor. I was in the service\r\nthat I might have something to eat (and solely for that reason), and\r\nwhen last year a distant relation left me six thousand roubles in his\r\nwill I immediately retired from the service and settled down in my\r\ncorner. I used to live in this corner before, but now I have settled\r\ndown in it. My room is a wretched, horrid one in the outskirts of the\r\ntown. My servant is an old country-woman, ill-natured from stupidity,\r\nand, moreover, there is always a nasty smell about her. I am told that\r\nthe Petersburg climate is bad for me, and that with my small means it is\r\nvery expensive to live in Petersburg. I know all that better than all\r\nthese sage and experienced counsellors and monitors.... But I am\r\nremaining in Petersburg; I am not going away from Petersburg! I am not\r\ngoing away because ... ech! Why, it is absolutely no matter whether I am\r\ngoing away or not going away.\r\n\r\nBut what can a decent man speak of with most pleasure?\r\n\r\nAnswer: Of himself.\r\n\r\nWell, so I will talk about myself.\r\n\nII\r\n\r\nI want now to tell you, gentlemen, whether you care to hear it or not,\r\nwhy I could not even become an insect. I tell you solemnly, that I have\r\nmany times tried to become an insect. But I was not equal even to that.\r\nI swear, gentlemen, that to be too conscious is an illness--a real\r\nthorough-going illness. For man's everyday needs, it would have been\r\nquite enough to have the ordinary human consciousness, that is, half or\r\na quarter of the amount which falls to the lot of a cultivated man of\r\nour unhappy nineteenth century, especially one who has the fatal\r\nill-luck to inhabit Petersburg, the most theoretical and intentional\r\ntown on the whole terrestrial globe. (There are intentional and\r\nunintentional towns.) It would have been quite enough, for instance, to\r\nhave the consciousness by which all so-called direct persons and men of\r\naction live. I bet you think I am writing all this from affectation, to\r\nbe witty at the expense of men of action; and what is more, that from\r\nill-bred affectation, I am clanking a sword like my officer. But,\r\ngentlemen, whoever can pride himself on his diseases and even swagger\r\nover them?\r\n\r\nThough, after all, every one does do that; people do pride themselves on\r\ntheir diseases, and I do, may be, more than any one. We will not dispute\r\nit; my contention was absurd. But yet I am firmly persuaded that a great\r\ndeal of consciousness, every sort of consciousness, in fact, is a\r\ndisease. I stick to that. Let us leave that, too, for a minute. Tell me\r\nthis: why does it happen that at the very, yes, at the very moments when\r\nI am most capable of feeling every refinement of all that is \"good and\r\nbeautiful,\" as they used to say at one time, it would, as though of\r\ndesign, happen to me not only to feel but to do such ugly things, such\r\nthat.... Well, in short, actions that all, perhaps, commit; but which,\r\nas though purposely, occurred to me at the very time when I was most\r\nconscious that they ought not to be committed. The more conscious I was\r\nof goodness and of all that was \"good and beautiful,\" the more deeply I\r\nsank into my mire and the more ready I was to sink in it altogether. But\r\nthe chief point was that all this was, as it were, not accidental in me,\r\nbut as though it were bound to be so. It was as though it were my most\r\nnormal condition, and not in the least disease or depravity, so that at\r\nlast all desire in me to struggle against this depravity passed. It\r\nended by my almost believing (perhaps actually believing) that this was\r\nperhaps my normal condition. But at first, in the beginning, what\r\nagonies I endured in that struggle! I did not believe it was the same\r\nwith other people, and all my life I hid this fact about myself as a\r\nsecret. I was ashamed (even now, perhaps, I am ashamed): I got to the\r\npoint of feeling a sort of secret abnormal, despicable enjoyment in\r\nreturning home to my corner on some disgusting Petersburg night, acutely\r\nconscious that that day I had committed a loathsome action again, that\r\nwhat was done could never be undone, and secretly, inwardly gnawing,\r\ngnawing at myself for it, tearing and consuming myself till at last the\r\nbitterness turned into a sort of shameful accursed sweetness, and at\r\nlast--into positive real enjoyment! Yes, into enjoyment, into enjoyment!\r\nI insist upon that. I have spoken of this because I keep wanting to know\r\nfor a fact whether other people feel such enjoyment? I will explain; the\r\nenjoyment was just from the too intense consciousness of one's own\r\ndegradation; it was from feeling oneself that one had reached the last\r\nbarrier, that it was horrible, but that it could not be otherwise; that\r\nthere was no escape for you; that you never could become a different\r\nman; that even if time and faith were still left you to change into\r\nsomething different you would most likely not wish to change; or if you\r\ndid wish to, even then you would do nothing; because perhaps in reality\r\nthere was nothing for you to change into.\r\n\r\nAnd the worst of it was, and the root of it all, that it was all in\r\naccord with the normal fundamental laws of over-acute consciousness, and\r\nwith the inertia that was the direct result of those laws, and that\r\nconsequently one was not only unable to change but could do absolutely\r\nnothing. Thus it would follow, as the result of acute consciousness,\r\nthat one is not to blame in being a scoundrel; as though that were any\r\nconsolation to the scoundrel once he has come to realize that he\r\nactually is a scoundrel. But enough.... Ech, I have talked a lot of\r\nnonsense, but what have I explained? How is enjoyment in this to be\r\nexplained? But I will explain it. I will get to the bottom of it! That\r\nis why I have taken up my pen....\r\n\r\nI, for instance, have a great deal of _amour propre_. I am as suspicious\r\nand prone to take offence as a humpback or a dwarf. But upon my word I\r\nsometimes have had moments when if I had happened to be slapped in the\r\nface I should, perhaps, have been positively glad of it. I say, in\r\nearnest, that I should probably have been able to discover even in that\r\na peculiar sort of enjoyment--the enjoyment, of course, of despair; but\r\nin despair there are the most intense enjoyments, especially when one is\r\nvery acutely conscious of the hopelessness of one's position. And when\r\none is slapped in the face--why then the consciousness of being rubbed\r\ninto a pulp would positively overwhelm one. The worst of it is, look at\r\nit which way one will, it still turns out that I was always the most to\r\nblame in everything. And what is most humiliating of all, to blame for\r\nno fault of my own but, so to say, through the laws of nature. In the\r\nfirst place, to blame because I am cleverer than any of the people\r\nsurrounding me. (I have always considered myself cleverer than any of\r\nthe people surrounding me, and sometimes, would you believe it, have\r\nbeen positively ashamed of it. At any rate, I have all my life, as it\r\nwere, turned my eyes away and never could look people straight in the\r\nface.) To blame, finally, because even if I had had magnanimity, I\r\nshould only have had more suffering from the sense of its uselessness. I\r\nshould certainly have never been able to do anything from being\r\nmagnanimous--neither to forgive, for my assailant would perhaps have\r\nslapped me from the laws of nature, and one cannot forgive the laws of\r\nnature; nor to forget, for even if it were owing to the laws of nature,\r\nit is insulting all the same. Finally, even if I had wanted to be\r\nanything but magnanimous, had desired on the contrary to revenge myself\r\non my assailant, I could not have revenged myself on any one for\r\nanything because I should certainly never have made up my mind to do\r\nanything, even if I had been able to. Why should I not have made up my\r\nmind? About that in particular I want to say a few words.\r\n\nIII\r\n\r\nWith people who know how to revenge themselves and to stand up for\r\nthemselves in general, how is it done? Why, when they are possessed, let\r\nus suppose, by the feeling of revenge, then for the time there is\r\nnothing else but that feeling left in their whole being. Such a\r\ngentleman simply dashes straight for his object like an infuriated bull\r\nwith its horns down, and nothing but a wall will stop him. (By the way:\r\nfacing the wall, such gentlemen--that is, the \"direct\" persons and men\r\nof action--are genuinely nonplussed. For them a wall is not an evasion,\r\nas for us people who think and consequently do nothing; it is not an\r\nexcuse for turning aside, an excuse for which we are always very glad,\r\nthough we scarcely believe in it ourselves, as a rule. No, they are\r\nnonplussed in all sincerity. The wall has for them something\r\ntranquillizing, morally soothing, final--maybe even something mysterious\r\n... but of the wall later.)\r\n\r\nWell, such a direct person I regard as the real normal man, as his\r\ntender mother nature wished to see him when she graciously brought him\r\ninto being on the earth. I envy such a man till I am green in the face.\r\nHe is stupid. I am not disputing that, but perhaps the normal man should\r\nbe stupid, how do you know? Perhaps it is very beautiful, in fact. And I\r\nam the more persuaded of that suspicion, if one can call it so, by the\r\nfact that if you take, for instance, the antithesis of the normal man,\r\nthat is, the man of acute consciousness, who has come, of course, not\r\nout of the lap of nature but out of a retort (this is almost mysticism,\r\ngentlemen, but I suspect this, too), this retort-made man is sometimes\r\nso nonplussed in the presence of his antithesis that with all his\r\nexaggerated consciousness he genuinely thinks of himself as a mouse and\r\nnot a man. It may be an acutely conscious mouse, yet it is a mouse,\r\nwhile the other is a man, and therefore, et caetera, et caetera. And the\r\nworst of it is, he himself, his very own self, looks on himself as a\r\nmouse; no one asks him to do so; and that is an important point. Now let\r\nus look at this mouse in action. Let us suppose, for instance, that it\r\nfeels insulted, too (and it almost always does feel insulted), and wants\r\nto revenge itself, too. There may even be a greater accumulation of\r\nspite in it than in _l'homme de la nature et de la verite_. The base and\r\nnasty desire to vent that spite on its assailant rankles perhaps even\r\nmore nastily in it than in _l'homme de la nature et de la verite_. For\r\nthrough his innate stupidity the latter looks upon his revenge as\r\njustice pure and simple; while in consequence of his acute consciousness\r\nthe mouse does not believe in the justice of it. To come at last to the\r\ndeed itself, to the very act of revenge. Apart from the one fundamental\r\nnastiness the luckless mouse succeeds in creating around it so many\r\nother nastinesses in the form of doubts and questions, adds to the one\r\nquestion so many unsettled questions that there inevitably works up\r\naround it a sort of fatal brew, a stinking mess, made up of its doubts,\r\nemotions, and of the contempt spat upon it by the direct men of action\r\nwho stand solemnly about it as judges and arbitrators, laughing at it\r\ntill their healthy sides ache. Of course the only thing left for it is\r\nto dismiss all that with a wave of its paw, and, with a smile of assumed\r\ncontempt in which it does not even itself believe, creep ignominiously\r\ninto its mouse-hole. There in its nasty, stinking, underground home our\r\ninsulted, crushed and ridiculed mouse promptly becomes absorbed in cold,\r\nmalignant and, above all, everlasting spite. For forty years together it\r\nwill remember its injury down to the smallest, most ignominious details,\r\nand every time will add, of itself, details still more ignominious,\r\nspitefully teasing and tormenting itself with its own imagination. It\r\nwill itself be ashamed of its imaginings, but yet it will recall it all,\r\nit will go over and over every detail, it will invent unheard of things\r\nagainst itself, pretending that those things might happen, and will\r\nforgive nothing. Maybe it will begin to revenge itself, too, but, as it\r\nwere, piecemeal, in trivial ways, from behind the stove, incognito,\r\nwithout believing either in its own right to vengeance, or in the\r\nsuccess of its revenge, knowing that from all its efforts at revenge it\r\nwill suffer a hundred times more than he on whom it revenges itself,\r\nwhile he, I daresay, will not even scratch himself. On its deathbed it\r\nwill recall it all over again, with interest accumulated over all the\r\nyears and....\r\n\r\nBut it is just in that cold, abominable half despair, half belief, in\r\nthat conscious burying oneself alive for grief in the underworld for\r\nforty years, in that acutely recognized and yet partly doubtful\r\nhopelessness of one's position, in that hell of unsatisfied desires\r\nturned inward, in that fever of oscillations, of resolutions determined\r\nfor ever and repented of again a minute later--that the savour of that\r\nstrange enjoyment of which I have spoken lies. It is so subtle, so\r\ndifficult of analysis, that persons who are a little limited, or even\r\nsimply persons of strong nerves, will not understand a single atom of\r\nit. \"Possibly,\" you will add on your own account with a grin, \"people\r\nwill not understand it either who have never received a slap in the\r\nface,\" and in that way you will politely hint to me that I, too,\r\nperhaps, have had the experience of a slap in the face in my life, and\r\nso I speak as one who knows. I bet that you are thinking that. But set\r\nyour minds at rest, gentlemen, I have not received a slap in the face,\r\nthough it is absolutely a matter of indifference to me what you may\r\nthink about it. Possibly, I even regret, myself, that I have given so\r\nfew slaps in the face during my life. But enough ... not another word on\r\nthat subject of such extreme interest to you.\r\n\r\nI will continue calmly concerning persons with strong nerves who do not\r\nunderstand a certain refinement of enjoyment. Though in certain\r\ncircumstances these gentlemen bellow their loudest like bulls, though\r\nthis, let us suppose, does them the greatest credit, yet, as I have said\r\nalready, confronted with the impossible they subside at once. The\r\nimpossible means the stone wall! What stone wall? Why, of course, the\r\nlaws of nature, the deductions of natural science, mathematics. As soon\r\nas they prove to you, for instance, that you are descended from a\r\nmonkey, then it is no use scowling, accept it for a fact. When they\r\nprove to you that in reality one drop of your own fat must be dearer to\r\nyou than a hundred thousand of your fellow creatures, and that this\r\nconclusion is the final solution of all so-called virtues and duties and\r\nall such prejudices and fancies, then you have just to accept it, there\r\nis no help for it, for twice two is a law of mathematics. Just try\r\nrefuting it.\r\n\r\n\"Upon my word, they will shout at you, it is no use protesting: it is a\r\ncase of twice two makes four! Nature does not ask your permission, she\r\nhas nothing to do with your wishes, and whether you like her laws or\r\ndislike them, you are bound to accept her as she is, and consequently\r\nall her conclusions. A wall, you see, is a wall ... and so on, and so\r\non.\"\r\n\r\nMerciful Heavens! but what do I care for the laws of nature and\r\narithmetic, when, for some reason I dislike those laws and the fact that\r\ntwice two makes four? Of course I cannot break through the wall by\r\nbattering my head against it if I really have not the strength to knock\r\nit down, but I am not going to be reconciled to it simply because it is\r\na stone wall and I have not the strength.\r\n\r\nAs though such a stone wall really were a consolation, and really did\r\ncontain some word of conciliation, simply because it is as true as twice\r\ntwo makes four. Oh, absurdity of absurdities! How much better it is to\r\nunderstand it all, to recognize it all, all the impossibilities and the\r\nstone wall; not to be reconciled to one of those impossibilities and\r\nstone walls if it disgusts you to be reconciled to it; by the way of the\r\nmost inevitable, logical combinations to reach the most revolting\r\nconclusions on the everlasting theme, that even for the stone wall you\r\nare yourself somehow to blame, though again it is as clear as day you\r\nare not to blame in the least, and therefore grinding your teeth in\r\nsilent impotence to sink into luxurious inertia, brooding on the fact\r\nthat there is no one even for you to feel vindictive against, that you\r\nhave not, and perhaps never will have, an object for your spite, that it\r\nis a sleight of hand, a bit of juggling, a card-sharper's trick, that it\r\nis simply a mess, no knowing what and no knowing who, but in spite of\r\nall these uncertainties and jugglings, still there is an ache in you,\r\nand the more you do not know, the worse the ache.\r\n\nIV\r\n\r\n\"Ha, ha, ha! You will be finding enjoyment in toothache next,\" you cry,\r\nwith a laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Well? Even in toothache there is enjoyment,\" I answer. I had toothache\r\nfor a whole month and I know there is. In that case, of course, people\r\nare not spiteful in silence, but moan; but they are not candid moans,\r\nthey are malignant moans, and the malignancy is the whole point. The\r\nenjoyment of the sufferer finds expression in those moans; if he did not\r\nfeel enjoyment in them he would not moan. It is a good example,\r\ngentlemen, and I will develop it. Those moans express in the first place\r\nall the aimlessness of your pain, which is so humiliating to your\r\nconsciousness; the whole legal system of nature on which you spit\r\ndisdainfully, of course, but from which you suffer all the same while\r\nshe does not. They express the consciousness that you have no enemy to\r\npunish, but that you have pain; the consciousness that in spite of all\r\npossible Vagenheims you are in complete slavery to your teeth; that if\r\nsome one wishes it, your teeth will leave off aching, and if he does\r\nnot, they will go on aching another three months; and that finally if\r\nyou are still contumacious and still protest, all that is left you for\r\nyour own gratification is to thrash yourself or beat your wall with your\r\nfist as hard as you can, and absolutely nothing more. Well, these mortal\r\ninsults, these jeers on the part of some one unknown, end at last in an\r\nenjoyment which sometimes reaches the highest degree of voluptuousness.\r\nI ask you, gentlemen, listen sometimes to the moans of an educated man\r\nof the nineteenth century suffering from toothache, on the second or\r\nthird day of the attack, when he is beginning to moan, not as he moaned\r\non the first day, that is, not simply because he has toothache, not just\r\nas any coarse peasant, but as a man affected by progress and European\r\ncivilization, a man who is \"divorced from the soil and the national\r\nelements,\" as they express it now-a-days. His moans become nasty,\r\ndisgustingly malignant, and go on for whole days and nights. And of\r\ncourse he knows himself that he is doing himself no sort of good with\r\nhis moans; he knows better than any one that he is only lacerating and\r\nharassing himself and others for nothing; he knows that even the\r\naudience before whom he is making his efforts, and his whole family,\r\nlisten to him with loathing, do not put a ha'porth of faith in him, and\r\ninwardly understand that he might moan differently, more simply, without\r\ntrills and flourishes, and that he is only amusing himself like that\r\nfrom ill-humour, from malignancy. Well, in all these recognitions and\r\ndisgraces it is that there lies a voluptuous pleasure. As though he\r\nwould say: \"I am worrying you, I am lacerating your hearts, I am keeping\r\nevery one in the house awake. Well, stay awake then, you, too, feel\r\nevery minute that I have toothache. I am not a hero to you now, as I\r\ntried to seem before, but simply a nasty person, an impostor. Well, so\r\nbe it, then! I am very glad that you see through me. It is nasty for you\r\nto hear my despicable moans: well, let it be nasty; here I will let you\r\nhave a nastier flourish in a minute....\" You do not understand even now,\r\ngentlemen? No, it seems our development and our consciousness must go\r\nfurther to understand all the intricacies of this pleasure. You laugh?\r\nDelighted. My jests, gentlemen, are of course in bad taste, jerky,\r\ninvolved, lacking self-confidence. But of course that is because I do\r\nnot respect myself. Can a man of perception respect himself at all?\r\n\nV\r\n\r\nCome, can a man who attempts to find enjoyment in the very feeling of\r\nhis own degradation possibly have a spark of respect for himself? I am\r\nnot saying this now from any mawkish kind of remorse. And, indeed, I\r\ncould never endure saying, \"Forgive me, Papa, I won't do it again,\" not\r\nbecause I am incapable of saying that--on the contrary, perhaps just\r\nbecause I have been too capable of it, and in what a way, too! As though\r\nof design I used to get into trouble in cases when I was not to blame in\r\nany way. That was the nastiest part of it. At the same time I was\r\ngenuinely touched and penitent, I used to shed tears and, of course,\r\ndeceived myself, though I was not acting in the least and there was a\r\nsick feeling in my heart at the time.... For that one could not blame\r\neven the laws of nature, though the laws of nature have continually all\r\nmy life offended me more than anything. It is loathsome to remember it\r\nall, but it was loathsome even then. Of course, a minute or so later I\r\nwould realize wrathfully that it was all a lie, a revolting lie, an\r\naffected lie, that is, all this penitence, this emotion, these vows of\r\nreform. You will ask why did I worry myself with such antics: answer,\r\nbecause it was very dull to sit with one's hands folded, and so one\r\nbegan cutting capers. That is really it. Observe yourselves more\r\ncarefully, gentlemen, then you will understand that it is so. I invented\r\nadventures for myself and made up a life, so as at least to live in some\r\nway. How many times it has happened to me--well, for instance, to take\r\noffence simply on purpose, for nothing; and one knows oneself, of\r\ncourse, that one is offended at nothing, that one is putting it on, but\r\nyet one brings oneself, at last to the point of being really offended.\r\nAll my life I have had an impulse to play such pranks, so that in the\r\nend I could not control it in myself. Another time, twice, in fact, I\r\ntried hard to be in love. I suffered, too, gentlemen, I assure you. In\r\nthe depth of my heart there was no faith in my suffering, only a faint\r\nstir of mockery, but yet I did suffer, and in the real, orthodox way; I\r\nwas jealous, beside myself ... and it was all from _ennui_, gentlemen,\r\nall from _ennui_; inertia overcame me. You know the direct, legitimate\r\nfruit of consciousness is inertia, that is, conscious\r\nsitting-with-the-hands-folded. I have referred to this already. I\r\nrepeat, I repeat with emphasis: all \"direct\" persons and men of action\r\nare active just because they are stupid and limited. How explain that? I\r\nwill tell you: in consequence of their limitation they take immediate\r\nand secondary causes for primary ones, and in that way persuade\r\nthemselves more quickly and easily than other people do that they have\r\nfound an infallible foundation for their activity, and their minds are\r\nat ease and you know that is the chief thing. To begin to act, you know,\r\nyou must first have your mind completely at ease and no trace of doubt\r\nleft in it. Why, how am I, for example to set my mind at rest? Where are\r\nthe primary causes on which I am to build? Where are my foundations?\r\nWhere am I to get them from? I exercise myself in reflection, and\r\nconsequently with me every primary cause at once draws after itself\r\nanother still more primary, and so on to infinity. That is just the\r\nessence of every sort of consciousness and reflection. It must be a case\r\nof the laws of nature again. What is the result of it in the end? Why,\r\njust the same. Remember I spoke just now of vengeance. (I am sure you\r\ndid not take it in.) I said that a man revenges himself because he sees\r\njustice in it. Therefore he has found a primary cause, that is, justice.\r\nAnd so he is at rest on all sides, and consequently he carries out his\r\nrevenge calmly and successfully, being persuaded that he is doing a just\r\nand honest thing. But I see no justice in it, I find no sort of virtue\r\nin it either, and consequently if I attempt to revenge myself, it is\r\nonly out of spite. Spite, of course, might overcome everything, all my\r\ndoubts, and so might serve quite successfully in place of a primary\r\ncause, precisely because it is not a cause. But what is to be done if I\r\nhave not even spite (I began with that just now, you know)? In\r\nconsequence again of those accursed laws of consciousness, anger in me\r\nis subject to chemical disintegration. You look into it, the object\r\nflies off into air, your reasons evaporate, the criminal is not to be\r\nfound, the wrong becomes not a wrong but a phantom, something like the\r\ntoothache, for which no one is to blame, and consequently there is only\r\nthe same outlet left again--that is, to beat the wall as hard as you\r\ncan. So you give it up with a wave of the hand because you have not\r\nfound a fundamental cause. And try letting yourself be carried away by\r\nyour feelings, blindly, without reflection, without a primary cause,\r\nrepelling consciousness at least for a time; hate or love, if only not\r\nto sit with your hands folded. The day after to-morrow, at the latest,\r\nyou will begin despising yourself for having knowingly deceived\r\nyourself. Result: a soap-bubble and inertia. Oh, gentlemen, do you know,\r\nperhaps I consider myself an intelligent man, only because all my life I\r\nhave been able neither to begin nor to finish anything. Granted I am a\r\nbabbler, a harmless vexatious babbler, like all of us. But what is to be\r\ndone if the direct and sole vocation of every intelligent man is babble,\r\nthat is, the intentional pouring of water through a sieve?\r\n\nVI\r\n\r\nOh, if I had done nothing simply from laziness! Heavens, how I should\r\nhave respected myself, then. I should have respected myself because I\r\nshould at least have been capable of being lazy; there would at least\r\nhave been one quality, as it were, positive in me, in which I could have\r\nbelieved myself. Question: What is he? Answer: A sluggard; how very\r\npleasant it would have been to hear that of oneself! It would mean that\r\nI was positively defined, it would mean that there was something to say\r\nabout me. \"Sluggard\"--why, it is a calling and vocation, it is a career.\r\nDo not jest, it is so. I should then be a member of the best club by\r\nright, and should find my occupation in continually respecting myself. I\r\nknew a gentleman who prided himself all his life on being a connoisseur\r\nof Lafitte. He considered this as his positive virtue, and never doubted\r\nhimself. He died, not simply with a tranquil, but with a triumphant,\r\nconscience, and he was quite right, too. Then I should have chosen a\r\ncareer for myself, I should have been a sluggard and a glutton, not a\r\nsimple one, but, for instance, one with sympathies for everything good\r\nand beautiful. How do you like that? I have long had visions of it. That\r\n\"good and beautiful\" weighs heavily on my mind at forty. But that is at\r\nforty; then--oh, then it would have been different! I should have found\r\nfor myself a form of activity in keeping with it, to be precise,\r\ndrinking to the health of everything \"good and beautiful.\" I should have\r\nsnatched at every opportunity to drop a tear into my glass and then to\r\ndrain it to all that is \"good and beautiful.\" I should then have turned\r\neverything into the good and the beautiful; in the nastiest,\r\nunquestionable trash, I should have sought out the good and the\r\nbeautiful. I should have exuded tears like a wet sponge. An artist, for\r\ninstance, paints a picture worthy of Gay. At once I drink to the health\r\nof the artist who painted the picture worthy of Gay, because I love all\r\nthat is \"good and beautiful.\" An author has written _As you will_: at\r\nonce I drink to the health of \"any one you will\" because I love all that\r\nis \"good and beautiful.\"\r\n\r\nI should claim respect for doing so. I should persecute any one who\r\nwould not show me respect. I should live at ease, I should die with\r\ndignity, why, it is charming, perfectly charming! And what a good round\r\nbelly I should have grown, what a treble chin I should have established,\r\nwhat a ruby nose I should have coloured for myself, so that every one\r\nwould have said, looking at me: \"Here is an asset! Here is something\r\nreal and solid!\" And, say what you like, it is very agreeable to hear\r\nsuch remarks about oneself in this negative age.\r\n\nVII\r\n\r\nBut these are all golden dreams. Oh, tell me, who was it first\r\nannounced, who was it first proclaimed, that man only does nasty things\r\nbecause he does not know his own interests; and that if he were\r\nenlightened, if his eyes were opened to his real normal interests, man\r\nwould at once cease to do nasty things, would at once become good and\r\nnoble because, being enlightened and understanding his real advantage,\r\nhe would see his own advantage in the good and nothing else, and we all\r\nknow that not one man can, consciously, act against his own interests,\r\nconsequently, so to say, through necessity, he would begin doing good?\r\nOh, the babe! Oh, the pure, innocent child! Why, in the first place,\r\nwhen in all these thousands of years has there been a time when man has\r\nacted only from his own interest? What is to be done with the millions\r\nof facts that bear witness that men, _consciously_, that is fully\r\nunderstanding their real interests, have left them in the background and\r\nhave rushed headlong on another path, to meet peril and danger,\r\ncompelled to this course by nobody and by nothing, but, as it were,\r\nsimply disliking the beaten track, and have obstinately, wilfully,\r\nstruck out another difficult, absurd way, seeking it almost in the\r\ndarkness. So, I suppose, this obstinacy and perversity were pleasanter\r\nto them than any advantage.... Advantage! What is advantage? And will\r\nyou take it upon yourself to define with perfect accuracy in what the\r\nadvantage of man consists? And what if it so happens that a man's\r\nadvantage, _sometimes_, not only may, but even must, consist in his\r\ndesiring in certain cases what is harmful to himself and not\r\nadvantageous? And if so, if there can be such a case, the whole\r\nprinciple falls into dust. What do you think--are there such cases? You\r\nlaugh; laugh away, gentlemen, but only answer me: have man's advantages\r\nbeen reckoned up with perfect certainty? Are there not some which not\r\nonly have not been included but cannot possibly be included under any\r\nclassification? You see, you gentlemen have, to the best of my\r\nknowledge, taken your whole register of human advantages from the\r\naverages of statistical figures and politico-economical formulas. Your\r\nadvantages are prosperity, wealth, freedom, peace--and so on, and so on.\r\nSo that the man who should, for instance, go openly and knowingly in\r\nopposition to all that list would, to your thinking, and indeed mine,\r\ntoo, of course, be an obscurantist or an absolute madman: would not he?\r\nBut, you know, this is what is surprising: why does it so happen that\r\nall these statisticians, sages and lovers of humanity, when they reckon\r\nup human advantages invariably leave out one? They don't even take it\r\ninto their reckoning in the form in which it should be taken, and the\r\nwhole reckoning depends upon that. It would be no great matter, they\r\nwould simply have to take it, this advantage, and add it to the list.\r\nBut the trouble is, that this strange advantage does not fall under any\r\nclassification and is not in place in any list. I have a friend for\r\ninstance.... Ech! gentlemen, but of course he is your friend, too; and\r\nindeed there is no one, no one, to whom he is not a friend! When he\r\nprepares for any undertaking this gentleman immediately explains to you,\r\nelegantly and clearly, exactly how he must act in accordance with the\r\nlaws of reason and truth. What is more, he will talk to you with\r\nexcitement and passion of the true normal interests of man; with irony\r\nhe will upbraid the shortsighted fools who do not understand their own\r\ninterests, nor the true significance of virtue; and, within a quarter of\r\nan hour, without any sudden outside provocation, but simply through\r\nsomething inside him which is stronger than all his interests, he will\r\ngo off on quite a different tack--that is, act in direct opposition to\r\nwhat he has just been saying about himself, in opposition to the laws of\r\nreason, in opposition to his own advantage, in fact in opposition to\r\neverything.... I warn you that my friend is a compound personality, and\r\ntherefore it is difficult to blame him as an individual. The fact is,\r\ngentlemen, it seems there must really exist something that is dearer to\r\nalmost every man than his greatest advantages, or (not to be illogical)\r\nthere is a most advantageous advantage (the very one omitted of which we\r\nspoke just now) which is more important and more advantageous than all\r\nother advantages, for the sake of which a man if necessary is ready to\r\nact in opposition to all laws; that is, in opposition to reason, honour,\r\npeace, prosperity--in fact, in opposition to all those excellent and\r\nuseful things if only he can attain that fundamental, most advantageous\r\nadvantage which is dearer to him than all. \"Yes, but it's advantage all\r\nthe same\" you will retort. But excuse me, I'll make the point clear, and\r\nit is not a case of playing upon words. What matters is, that this\r\nadvantage is remarkable from the very fact that it breaks down all our\r\nclassifications, and continually shatters every system constructed by\r\nlovers of mankind for the benefit of mankind. In fact, it upsets\r\neverything. But before I mention this advantage to you, I want to\r\ncompromise myself personally, and therefore I boldly declare that all\r\nthese fine systems, all these theories for explaining to mankind their\r\nreal normal interests, in order that inevitably striving to pursue these\r\ninterests they may at once become good and noble--are, in my opinion, so\r\nfar, mere logical exercises! Yes, logical exercises. Why, to maintain\r\nthis theory of the regeneration of mankind by means of the pursuit of\r\nhis own advantage is to my mind almost the same thing as ... as to\r\naffirm, for instance, following Buckle, that through civilization\r\nmankind becomes softer, and consequently less bloodthirsty and less\r\nfitted for warfare. Logically it does seem to follow from his arguments.\r\nBut man has such a predilection for systems and abstract deductions that\r\nhe is ready to distort the truth intentionally, he is ready to deny the\r\nevidence of his senses only to justify his logic. I take this example\r\nbecause it is the most glaring instance of it. Only look about you:\r\nblood is being spilt in streams, and in the merriest way, as though it\r\nwere champagne. Take the whole of the nineteenth century in which Buckle\r\nlived. Take Napoleon--the Great and also the present one. Take North\r\nAmerica--the eternal union. Take the farce of Schleswig-Holstein.... And\r\nwhat is it that civilization softens in us? The only gain of\r\ncivilization for mankind is the greater capacity for variety of\r\nsensations--and absolutely nothing more. And through the development of\r\nthis many-sidedness man may come to finding enjoyment in bloodshed. In\r\nfact, this has already happened to him. Have you noticed that it is the\r\nmost civilized gentlemen who have been the subtlest slaughterers, to\r\nwhom the Attilas and Stenka Razins could not hold a candle, and if they\r\nare not so conspicuous as the Attilas and Stenka Razins it is simply\r\nbecause they are so often met with, are so ordinary and have become so\r\nfamiliar to us. In any case civilization has made mankind if not more\r\nbloodthirsty, at least more vilely, more loathsomely bloodthirsty. In\r\nold days he saw justice in bloodshed and with his conscience at peace\r\nexterminated those he thought proper. Now we do think bloodshed\r\nabominable and yet we engage in this abomination, and with more energy\r\nthan ever. Which is worse? Decide that for yourselves. They say that\r\nCleopatra (excuse an instance from Roman history) was fond of sticking\r\ngold pins into her slave-girls' breasts and derived gratification from\r\ntheir screams and writhings. You will say that that was in the\r\ncomparatively barbarous times; that these are barbarous times too,\r\nbecause also, comparatively speaking, pins are stuck in even now; that\r\nthough man has now learned to see more clearly than in barbarous ages,\r\nhe is still far from having learnt to act as reason and science would\r\ndictate. But yet you are fully convinced that he will be sure to learn\r\nwhen he gets rid of certain old bad habits, and when common sense and\r\nscience have completely re-educated human nature and turned it in a\r\nnormal direction. You are confident that then man will cease from\r\n_intentional_ error and will, so to say, be compelled not to want to set\r\nhis will against his normal interests. That is not all; then, you say,\r\nscience itself will teach man (though to my mind it's a superfluous\r\nluxury) that he never has really had any caprice or will of his own, and\r\nthat he himself is something of the nature of a piano-key or the stop of\r\nan organ, and that there are, besides, things called the laws of nature;\r\nso that everything he does is not done by his willing it, but is done of\r\nitself, by the laws of nature. Consequently we have only to discover\r\nthese laws of nature, and man will no longer have to answer for his\r\nactions and life will become exceedingly easy for him. All human actions\r\nwill then, of course, be tabulated according to these laws,\r\nmathematically, like tables of logarithms up to 108,000, and entered in\r\nan index; or, better still, there would be published certain edifying\r\nworks of the nature of encyclopaedic lexicons, in which everything will\r\nbe so clearly calculated and explained that there will be no more\r\nincidents or adventures in the world.\r\n\r\nThen--this is all what you say--new economic relations will be\r\nestablished, all ready-made and worked out with mathematical exactitude,\r\nso that every possible question will vanish in the twinkling of an eye,\r\nsimply because every possible answer to it will be provided. Then the\r\n\"Palace of Crystal\" will be built. Then.... In fact, those will be\r\nhalcyon days. Of course there is no guaranteeing (this is my comment)\r\nthat it will not be, for instance, frightfully dull then (for what will\r\none have to do when everything will be calculated and tabulated?), but on\r\nthe other hand everything will be extraordinarily rational. Of course\r\nboredom may lead you to anything. It is boredom sets one sticking golden\r\npins into people, but all that would not matter. What is bad (this is my\r\ncomment again) is that I dare say people will be thankful for the gold\r\npins then. Man is stupid, you know, phenomenally stupid; or rather he is\r\nnot at all stupid, but he is so ungrateful that you could not find\r\nanother like him in all creation. I, for instance, would not be in the\r\nleast surprised if all of a sudden, _a propos_ of nothing, in the midst\r\nof general prosperity a gentleman with an ignoble, or rather with a\r\nreactionary and ironical, countenance were to arise and, putting his\r\narms akimbo, say to us all: \"I say, gentlemen, hadn't we better kick\r\nover the whole show and scatter rationalism to the winds, simply to send\r\nthese logarithms to the devil, and to enable us to live once more at our\r\nown sweet foolish will!\" That again would not matter; but what is\r\nannoying is that he would be sure to find followers--such is the nature\r\nof man. And all that for the most foolish reason, which, one would\r\nthink, was hardly worth mentioning: that is, that man everywhere and at\r\nall times, whoever he may be, has preferred to act as he chose and not\r\nin the least as his reason and advantage dictated. And one may choose\r\nwhat is contrary to one's own interests, and sometimes one _positively\r\nought_ (that is my idea). One's own free unfettered choice, one's own\r\ncaprice, however wild it may be, one's own fancy worked up at times to\r\nfrenzy--is that very \"most advantageous advantage\" which we have\r\noverlooked, which comes under no classification and against which all\r\nsystems and theories are continually being shattered to atoms. And how\r\ndo these wiseacres know that man wants a normal, a virtuous choice? What\r\nhas made them conceive that man must want a rationally advantageous\r\nchoice? What man wants is simply _independent_ choice, whatever that\r\nindependence may cost and wherever it may lead. And choice, of course,\r\nthe devil only knows what choice....\r\n\nVIII\r\n\r\n\"Ha! ha! ha! But you know there is no such thing as choice in reality,\r\nsay what you like,\" you will interpose with a chuckle. \"Science has\r\nsucceeded in so far analysing man that we know already that choice and\r\nwhat is called freedom of will is nothing else than----\"\r\n\r\nStay, gentlemen, I meant to begin with that myself. I confess, I was\r\nrather frightened. I was just going to say that the devil only knows\r\nwhat choice depends on, and that perhaps that was a very good thing, but\r\nI remembered the teaching of science ... and pulled myself up. And here\r\nyou have begun upon it. Indeed, if there really is some day discovered a\r\nformula for all our desires and caprices--that is, an explanation of\r\nwhat they depend upon, by what laws they arise, how they develop, what\r\nthey are aiming at in one case and in another and so on, that is a real\r\nmathematical formula--then, most likely, man will at once cease to feel\r\ndesire, indeed, he will be certain to. For who would want to choose by\r\nrule? Besides, he will at once be transformed from a human being into an\r\norgan-stop or something of the sort; for what is a man without desires,\r\nwithout free will and without choice, if not a stop in an organ? What do\r\nyou think? Let us reckon the chances--can such a thing happen or not?\r\n\r\n\"H'm!\" you decide. \"Our choice is usually mistaken from a false view of\r\nour advantage. We sometimes choose absolute nonsense because in our\r\nfoolishness we see in that nonsense the easiest means for attaining a\r\nsupposed advantage. But when all that is explained and worked out on\r\npaper (which is perfectly possible, for it is contemptible and senseless\r\nto suppose that some laws of nature man will never understand), then\r\ncertainly so-called desires will no longer exist. For if a desire should\r\ncome into conflict with reason we shall then reason and not desire,\r\nbecause it will be impossible retaining our reason to be _senseless_ in\r\nour desires, and in that way knowingly act against reason and desire to\r\ninjure ourselves. And as all choice and reasoning can be really\r\ncalculated--because there will some day be discovered the laws of our\r\nso-called free will--so, joking apart, there may one day be something\r\nlike a table constructed of them, so that we really shall choose in\r\naccordance with it. If, for instance, some day they calculate and prove\r\nto me that I made a long nose at some one because I could not help\r\nmaking a long nose at him and that I had to do it in that particular\r\nway, what _freedom_ is left me, especially if I am a learned man and\r\nhave taken my degree somewhere? Then I should be able to calculate my\r\nwhole life for thirty years beforehand. In short, if this could be\r\narranged there would be nothing left for us to do; anyway, we should\r\nhave to understand that. And, in fact, we ought unwearyingly to repeat\r\nto ourselves that at such and such a time and in such and such\r\ncircumstances nature does not ask our leave; that we have got to take\r\nher as she is and not fashion her to suit our fancy, and if we really\r\naspire to formulas and tables of rules, and well, even ... to the\r\nchemical retort, there's no help for it, we must accept the retort too,\r\nor else it will be accepted without our consent....\"\r\n\r\nYes, but here I come to a stop! Gentlemen, you must excuse me for being\r\nover-philosophical; it's the result of forty years underground! Allow me\r\nto indulge my fancy. You see, gentlemen, reason is an excellent thing,\r\nthere's no disputing that, but reason is nothing but reason and\r\nsatisfies only the rational side of man's nature, while will is a\r\nmanifestation of the whole life, that is, of the whole human life\r\nincluding reason and all the impulses. And although our life, in this\r\nmanifestation of it, is often worthless, yet it is life and not simply\r\nextracting square roots. Here I, for instance, quite naturally want to\r\nlive, in order to satisfy all my capacities for life, and not simply my\r\ncapacity for reasoning, that is, not simply one twentieth of my capacity\r\nfor life. What does reason know? Reason only knows what it has succeeded\r\nin learning (some things, perhaps, it will never learn; this is a poor\r\ncomfort, but why not say so frankly?) and human nature acts as a whole,\r\nwith everything that is in it, consciously or unconsciously, and, even\r\nif it goes wrong, it lives. I suspect, gentlemen, that you are looking\r\nat me with compassion; you tell me again that an enlightened and\r\ndeveloped man, such, in short, as the future man will be, cannot\r\nconsciously desire anything disadvantageous to himself, that that can be\r\nproved mathematically. I thoroughly agree, it can--by mathematics. But I\r\nrepeat for the hundredth time, there is one case, one only, when man may\r\nconsciously, purposely, desire what is injurious to himself, what is\r\nstupid, very stupid--simply in order to have the right to desire for\r\nhimself even what is very stupid and not to be bound by an obligation to\r\ndesire only what is sensible. Of course, this very stupid thing, this\r\ncaprice of ours, may be in reality, gentlemen, more advantageous for us\r\nthan anything else on earth, especially in certain cases. And in\r\nparticular it may be more advantageous than any advantage even when it\r\ndoes us obvious harm, and contradicts the soundest conclusions of our\r\nreason concerning our advantage--for in any circumstances it preserves\r\nfor us what is most precious and most important--that is, our\r\npersonality, our individuality. Some, you see, maintain that this really\r\nis the most precious thing for mankind; choice can, of course, if it\r\nchooses, be in agreement with reason; and especially if this be not\r\nabused but kept within bounds. It is profitable and sometimes even\r\npraiseworthy. But very often, and even most often, choice is utterly and\r\nstubbornly opposed to reason ... and ... and ... do you know that that,\r\ntoo, is profitable, sometimes even praiseworthy? Gentlemen, let us\r\nsuppose that man is not stupid. (Indeed one cannot refuse to suppose\r\nthat, if only from the one consideration, that, if man is stupid, then\r\nwho is wise?) But if he is not stupid, he is monstrously ungrateful!\r\nPhenomenally ungrateful. In fact, I believe that the best definition of\r\nman is the ungrateful biped. But that is not all, that is not his worst\r\ndefect; his worst defect is his perpetual moral obliquity,\r\nperpetual--from the days of the Flood to the Schleswig-Holstein period.\r\nMoral obliquity and consequently lack of good sense; for it has long\r\nbeen accepted that lack of good sense is due to no other cause than\r\nmoral obliquity. Put it to the test and cast your eyes upon the history\r\nof mankind. What will you see? Is it a grand spectacle? Grand, if you\r\nlike. Take the Colossus of Rhodes, for instance, that's worth something.\r\nWith good reason Mr. Anaevsky testifies of it that some say that it is\r\nthe work of man's hands, while others maintain that it has been created\r\nby nature herself. Is it many-coloured? May be it is many-coloured, too:\r\nif one takes the dress uniforms, military and civilian, of all peoples\r\nin all ages--that alone is worth something, and if you take the undress\r\nuniforms you will never get to the end of it; no historian would be\r\nequal to the job. Is it monotonous? May be it's monotonous too: it's\r\nfighting and fighting; they are fighting now, they fought first and they\r\nfought last--you will admit, that it is almost too monotonous. In short,\r\none may say anything about the history of the world--anything that might\r\nenter the most disordered imagination. The only thing one can't say is\r\nthat it's rational. The very word sticks in one's throat. And, indeed,\r\nthis is the odd thing that is continually happening: there are\r\ncontinually turning up in life moral and rational persons, sages and\r\nlovers of humanity who make it their object to live all their lives as\r\nmorally and rationally as possible, to be, so to speak, a light to their\r\nneighbours simply in order to show them that it is possible to live\r\nmorally and rationally in this world. And yet we all know that those\r\nvery people sooner or later have been false to themselves, playing some\r\nqueer trick, often a most unseemly one. Now I ask you: what can be\r\nexpected of man since he is a being endowed with such strange qualities?\r\nShower upon him every earthly blessing, drown him in a sea of happiness,\r\nso that nothing but bubbles of bliss can be seen on the surface; give\r\nhim economic prosperity, such that he should have nothing else to do but\r\nsleep, eat cakes and busy himself with the continuation of his species,\r\nand even then out of sheer ingratitude, sheer spite, man would play you\r\nsome nasty trick. He would even risk his cakes and would deliberately\r\ndesire the most fatal rubbish, the most uneconomical absurdity, simply\r\nto introduce into all this positive good sense his fatal fantastic\r\nelement. It is just his fantastic dreams, his vulgar folly that he will\r\ndesire to retain, simply in order to prove to himself--as though that\r\nwere so necessary--that men still are men and not the keys of a piano,\r\nwhich the laws of nature threaten to control so completely that soon one\r\nwill be able to desire nothing but by the calendar. And that is not all:\r\neven if man really were nothing but a piano-key, even if this were\r\nproved to him by natural science and mathematics, even then he would not\r\nbecome reasonable, but would purposely do something perverse out of\r\nsimple ingratitude, simply to gain his point. And if he does not find\r\nmeans he will contrive destruction and chaos, will contrive sufferings\r\nof all sorts, only to gain his point! He will launch a curse upon the\r\nworld, and as only man can curse (it is his privilege, the primary\r\ndistinction between him and other animals), may be by his curse alone he\r\nwill attain his object--that is, convince himself that he is a man and\r\nnot a piano-key! If you say that all this, too, can be calculated and\r\ntabulated--chaos and darkness and curses, so that the mere possibility\r\nof calculating it all beforehand would stop it all, and reason would\r\nreassert itself, then man would purposely go mad in order to be rid of\r\nreason and gain his point! I believe in it, I answer for it, for the\r\nwhole work of man really seems to consist in nothing but proving to\r\nhimself every minute that he is a man and not a piano-key! It may be at\r\nthe cost of his skin, it may be by cannibalism! And this being so, can\r\none help being tempted to rejoice that it has not yet come off, and that\r\ndesire still depends on something we don't know?\r\n\r\nYou will scream at me (that is, if you condescend to do so) that no one\r\nis touching my free will, that all they are concerned with is that my\r\nwill should of itself, of its own free will, coincide with my own normal\r\ninterests, with the laws of nature and arithmetic.\r\n\r\nGood Heavens, gentlemen, what sort of free will is left when we come to\r\ntabulation and arithmetic, when it will all be a case of twice two make\r\nfour? Twice two makes four without my will. As if free will meant that!\r\n\nIX\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I am joking, and I know myself that my jokes are not\r\nbrilliant, but you know one can't take everything as a joke. I am,\r\nperhaps, jesting against the grain. Gentlemen, I am tormented by\r\nquestions; answer them for me. You, for instance, want to cure men of\r\ntheir old habits and reform their will in accordance with science and\r\ngood sense. But how do you know, not only that it is possible, but also\r\nthat it is _desirable_, to reform man in that way? And what leads you to\r\nthe conclusion that man's inclinations _need_ reforming? In short, how\r\ndo you know that such a reformation will be a benefit to man? And to go\r\nto the root of the matter, why are you so positively convinced that not\r\nto act against his real normal interests guaranteed by the conclusions\r\nof reason and arithmetic is certainly always advantageous for man and\r\nmust always be a law for mankind? So far, you know, this is only your\r\nsupposition. It may be the law of logic, but not the law of humanity.\r\nYou think, gentlemen, perhaps that I am mad? Allow me to defend myself.\r\nI agree that man is pre-eminently a creative animal, predestined to\r\nstrive consciously for an object and to engage in engineering--that is,\r\nincessantly and eternally to make new roads, _wherever they may lead_.\r\nBut the reason why he wants sometimes to go off at a tangent may just be\r\nthat he is _predestined_ to make the road, and perhaps, too, that\r\nhowever stupid the \"direct\" practical man may be, the thought sometimes\r\nwill occur to him that the road almost always does lead _somewhere_, and\r\nthat the destination it leads to is less important than the process of\r\nmaking it, and that the chief thing is to save the well-conducted child\r\nfrom despising engineering, and so giving way to the fatal idleness,\r\nwhich, as we all know, is the mother of all the vices. Man likes to make\r\nroads and to create, that is a fact beyond dispute. But why has he such\r\na passionate love for destruction and chaos also? Tell me that! But on\r\nthat point I want to say a couple of words myself. May it not be that he\r\nloves chaos and destruction (there can be no disputing that he does\r\nsometimes love it) because he is instinctively afraid of attaining his\r\nobject and completing the edifice he is constructing? Who knows, perhaps\r\nhe only loves that edifice from a distance, and is by no means in love\r\nwith it at close quarters; perhaps he only loves building it and does\r\nnot want to live in it, but will leave it, when completed, for the use\r\nof _les animaux domestiques_--such as the ants, the sheep, and so on.\r\nNow the ants have quite a different taste. They have a marvellous\r\nedifice of that pattern which endures for ever--the ant-heap.\r\n\r\nWith the ant-heap the respectable race of ants began and with the\r\nant-heap they will probably end, which does the greatest credit to their\r\nperseverance and good sense. But man is a frivolous and incongruous\r\ncreature, and perhaps, like a chess player, loves the process of the\r\ngame, not the end of it. And who knows (there is no saying with\r\ncertainty), perhaps the only goal on earth to which mankind is striving\r\nlies in this incessant process of attaining, in other words, in life\r\nitself, and not in the thing to be attained, which must always be\r\nexpressed as a formula, as positive as twice two makes four, and such\r\npositiveness is not life, gentlemen, but is the beginning of death.\r\nAnyway, man has always been afraid of this mathematical certainty, and I\r\nam afraid of it now. Granted that man does nothing but seek that\r\nmathematical certainty, he traverses oceans, sacrifices his life in the\r\nquest, but to succeed, really to find it, he dreads, I assure you. He\r\nfeels that when he has found it there will be nothing for him to look\r\nfor. When workmen have finished their work they do at least receive\r\ntheir pay, they go to the tavern, then they are taken to the\r\npolice-station--and there is occupation for a week. But where can man\r\ngo? Anyway, one can observe a certain awkwardness about him when he has\r\nattained such objects. He loves the process of attaining, but does not\r\nquite like to have attained, and that, of course, is very absurd. In\r\nfact, man is a comical creature; there seems to be a kind of jest in it\r\nall. But yet mathematical certainty is, after all, something\r\ninsufferable. Twice two makes four seems to me simply a piece of\r\ninsolence. Twice two makes four is a pert coxcomb who stands with arms\r\nakimbo barring your path and spitting. I admit that twice two makes four\r\nis an excellent thing, but if we are to give everything its due, twice\r\ntwo makes five is sometimes a very charming thing too.\r\n\r\nAnd why are you so firmly, so triumphantly, convinced that only the\r\nnormal and the positive--in other words, only what is conducive to\r\nwelfare--is for the advantage of man? Is not reason in error as regards\r\nadvantage? Does not man, perhaps, love something besides well-being?\r\nPerhaps he is just as fond of suffering? Perhaps suffering is just as\r\ngreat a benefit to him as well-being? Man is sometimes extraordinarily,\r\npassionately, in love with suffering, and that is a fact. There is no\r\nneed to appeal to universal history to prove that; only ask yourself, if\r\nyou are a man and have lived at all. As far as my personal opinion is\r\nconcerned, to care only for well-being seems to me positively ill-bred.\r\nWhether it's good or bad, it is sometimes very pleasant, too, to smash\r\nthings. I hold no brief for suffering nor for well-being either. I am\r\nstanding for ... my caprice, and for its being guaranteed to me when\r\nnecessary. Suffering would be out of place in vaudevilles, for instance;\r\nI know that. In the \"Palace of Crystal\" it is unthinkable; suffering\r\nmeans doubt, negation, and what would be the good of a \"palace of\r\ncrystal\" if there could be any doubt about it? And yet I think man will\r\nnever renounce real suffering, that is, destruction and chaos. Why,\r\nsuffering is the sole origin of consciousness. Though I did lay it down\r\nat the beginning that consciousness is the greatest misfortune for man,\r\nyet I know man prizes it and would not give it up for any satisfaction.\r\nConsciousness, for instance, is infinitely superior to twice two makes\r\nfour. Once you have mathematical certainty there is nothing left to do\r\nor to understand. There will be nothing left but to bottle up your five\r\nsenses and plunge into contemplation. While if you stick to\r\nconsciousness, even though the same result is attained, you can at least\r\nflog yourself at times, and that will, at any rate, liven you up.\r\nReactionary as it is, corporal punishment is better than nothing.\r\n\nX\r\n\r\nYou believe in a palace of crystal that can never be destroyed--a palace\r\nat which one will not be able to put out one's tongue or make a long\r\nnose on the sly. And perhaps that is just why I am afraid of this\r\nedifice, that it is of crystal and can never be destroyed and that one\r\ncannot put one's tongue out at it even on the sly.\r\n\r\nYou see, if it were not a palace, but a hen-house, I might creep into it\r\nto avoid getting wet, and yet I would not call the hen-house a palace\r\nout of gratitude to it for keeping me dry. You laugh and say that in\r\nsuch circumstances a hen-house is as good as a mansion. Yes, I answer,\r\nif one had to live simply to keep out of the rain.\r\n\r\nBut what is to be done if I have taken it into my head that that is not\r\nthe only object in life, and that if one must live one had better live\r\nin a mansion. That is my choice, my desire. You will only eradicate it\r\nwhen you have changed my preference. Well, do change it, allure me with\r\nsomething else, give me another ideal. But meanwhile I will not take a\r\nhen-house for a mansion. The palace of crystal may be an idle dream, it\r\nmay be that it is inconsistent with the laws of nature and that I have\r\ninvented it only through my own stupidity, through the old-fashioned\r\nirrational habits of my generation. But what does it matter to me that\r\nit is inconsistent? That makes no difference since it exists in my\r\ndesires, or rather exists as long as my desires exist. Perhaps you are\r\nlaughing again? Laugh away; I will put up with any mockery rather than\r\npretend that I am satisfied when I am hungry. I know, anyway, that I\r\nwill not be put off with a compromise, with a recurring zero, simply\r\nbecause it is consistent with the laws of nature and actually exists. I\r\nwill not accept as the crown of my desires a block of buildings with\r\ntenements for the poor on a lease of a thousand years, and perhaps with\r\na sign-board of a dentist hanging out. Destroy my desires, eradicate my\r\nideals, show me something better, and I will follow you. You will say,\r\nperhaps, that it is not worth your trouble; but in that case I can give\r\nyou the same answer. We are discussing things seriously; but if you\r\nwon't deign to give me your attention, I will drop your acquaintance. I\r\ncan retreat into my underground hole.\r\n\r\nBut while I am alive and have desires I would rather my hand were\r\nwithered off than bring one brick to such a building! Don't remind me\r\nthat I have just rejected the palace of crystal for the sole reason that\r\none cannot put out one's tongue at it. I did not say because I am so\r\nfond of putting my tongue out. Perhaps the thing I resented was, that of\r\nall your edifices there has not been one at which one could not put out\r\none's tongue. On the contrary, I would let my tongue be cut off out of\r\ngratitude if things could be so arranged that I should lose all desire\r\nto put it out. It is not my fault that things cannot be so arranged, and\r\nthat one must be satisfied with model flats. Then why am I made with\r\nsuch desires? Can I have been constructed simply in order to come to the\r\nconclusion that all my construction is a cheat? Can this be my whole\r\npurpose? I do not believe it.\r\n\r\nBut do you know what: I am convinced that we underground folk ought to\r\nbe kept on a curb. Though we may sit forty years underground without\r\nspeaking, when we do come out into the light of day and break out we\r\ntalk and talk and talk....\r\n\nXI\r\n\r\nThe long and the short of it is, gentlemen, that it is better to do\r\nnothing! Better conscious inertia! And so hurrah for underground! Though\r\nI have said that I envy the normal man to the last drop of my bile, yet\r\nI should not care to be in his place such as he is now (though I shall\r\nnot cease envying him). No, no; anyway the underground life is more\r\nadvantageous. There, at any rate, one can.... Oh, but even now I am\r\nlying! I am lying because I know myself that it is not underground that\r\nis better, but something different, quite different, for which I am\r\nthirsting, but which I cannot find! Damn underground!\r\n\r\nI will tell you another thing that would be better, and that is, if I\r\nmyself believed in anything of what I have just written. I swear to you,\r\ngentlemen, there is not one thing, not one word of what I have written\r\nthat I really believe. That is, I believe it, perhaps, but at the same\r\ntime I feel and suspect that I am lying like a cobbler.\r\n\r\n\"Then why have you written all this?\" you will say to me.\r\n\r\n\"I ought to put you underground for forty years without anything to do\r\nand then come to you in your cellar, to find out what stage you have\r\nreached! How can a man be left with nothing to do for forty years?\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't that shameful, isn't that humiliating?\" you will say, perhaps,\r\nwagging your heads contemptuously. \"You thirst for life and try to\r\nsettle the problems of life by a logical tangle. And how persistent, how\r\ninsolent are your sallies, and at the same time what a scare you are in!\r\nYou talk nonsense and are pleased with it; you say impudent things and\r\nare in continual alarm and apologizing for them. You declare that you\r\nare afraid of nothing and at the same time try to ingratiate yourself in\r\nour good opinion. You declare that you are gnashing your teeth and at\r\nthe same time you try to be witty so as to amuse us. You know that your\r\nwitticisms are not witty, but you are evidently well satisfied with\r\ntheir literary value. You may, perhaps, have really suffered, but you\r\nhave no respect for your own suffering. You may have sincerity, but you\r\nhave no modesty; out of the pettiest vanity you expose your sincerity to\r\npublicity and ignominy. You doubtlessly mean to say something, but hide\r\nyour last word through fear, because you have not the resolution to\r\nutter it, and only have a cowardly impudence. You boast of\r\nconsciousness, but you are not sure of your ground, for though your mind\r\nworks, yet your heart is darkened and corrupt, and you cannot have a\r\nfull, genuine consciousness without a pure heart. And how intrusive you\r\nare, how you insist and grimace! Lies, lies, lies!\"\r\n\r\nOf course I have myself made up all the things you say. That, too, is\r\nfrom underground. I have been for forty years listening to you through a\r\ncrack under the floor. I have invented them myself, there was nothing\r\nelse I could invent. It is no wonder that I have learned it by heart and\r\nit has taken a literary form....\r\n\r\nBut can you really be so credulous as to think that I will print all\r\nthis and give it to you to read too? And another problem: why do I call\r\nyou \"gentlemen,\" why do I address you as though you really were my\r\nreaders? Such confessions as I intend to make are never printed nor\r\ngiven to other people to read. Anyway, I am not strong-minded enough for\r\nthat, and I don't see why I should be. But you see a fancy has occurred\r\nto me and I want to realize it at all costs. Let me explain.\r\n\r\nEvery man has reminiscences which he would not tell to every one, but\r\nonly to his friends. He has other matters in his mind which he would not\r\nreveal even to his friends, but only to himself, and that in secret. But\r\nthere are other things which a man is afraid to tell even to himself,\r\nand every decent man has a number of such things stored away in his\r\nmind. The more decent he is, the greater the number of such things in\r\nhis mind. Anyway, I have only lately determined to remember some of my\r\nearly adventures. Till now I have always avoided them, even with a\r\ncertain uneasiness. Now, when I am not only recalling them, but have\r\nactually decided to write an account of them, I want to try the\r\nexperiment whether one can, even with oneself, be perfectly open and not\r\ntake fright at the whole truth. I will observe, in parenthesis, that\r\nHeine says that a true autobiography is almost an impossibility, and\r\nthat man is bound to lie about himself. He considers that Rousseau\r\ncertainly told lies about himself in his confessions, and even\r\nintentionally lied, out of vanity. I am convinced that Heine is right; I\r\nquite understand how sometimes one may, out of sheer vanity, attribute\r\nregular crimes to oneself, and indeed I can very well conceive that kind\r\nof vanity. But Heine judged of people who made their confessions to the\r\npublic. I write only for myself, and I wish to declare once and for all\r\nthat if I write as though I were addressing readers, that is simply\r\nbecause it is easier for me to write in that form. It is a form, an\r\nempty form--I shall never have readers. I have made this plain\r\nalready....\r\n\r\nI don't wish to be hampered by any restrictions in the compilation of my\r\nnotes. I shall not attempt any system or method. I will jot things down\r\nas I remember them.\r\n\r\nBut here, perhaps, some one will catch at the word and ask me: if you\r\nreally don't reckon on readers, why do you make such compacts with\r\nyourself--and on paper too--that is, that you won't attempt any system\r\nor method, that you jot things down as you remember them, and so on, and\r\nso on? Why are you explaining? Why do you apologize?\r\n\r\nWell, there it is, I answer.\r\n\r\nThere is a whole psychology in all this, though. Perhaps it is simply\r\nthat I am a coward. And perhaps that I purposely imagine an audience\r\nbefore me in order that I may be more dignified while I write. There are\r\nperhaps thousands of reasons. Again, what is my object precisely in\r\nwriting? If it is not for the benefit of the public why should I not\r\nsimply recall these incidents in my own mind without putting them on\r\npaper?\r\n\r\nQuite so; but yet it is more imposing on paper. There is something more\r\nimpressive in it; I shall be better able to criticize myself and improve\r\nmy style. Besides, I shall perhaps obtain actual relief from writing.\r\nTo-day, for instance, I am particularly oppressed by one memory of a\r\ndistant past. It came back vividly to my mind a few days ago, and has\r\nremained haunting me like an annoying tune that one cannot get rid of.\r\nAnd yet I must get rid of it somehow. I have hundreds of such\r\nreminiscences; but at times some one stands out from the hundred and\r\noppresses me. For some reason I believe that if I write it down I should\r\nget rid of it. Why not try?\r\n\r\nBesides, I am bored, and I never have anything to do. Writing will be a\r\nsort of work. They say work makes man kind-hearted and honest. Well,\r\nhere is a chance for me, anyway.\r\n\r\nSnow is falling to-day, yellow and dingy. It fell yesterday, too, and a\r\nfew days ago. I fancy it is the wet snow that has reminded me of that\r\nincident which I cannot shake off now. And so let it be a story _a\r\npropos_ of the falling snow.\r\n\n PART II\r\n\r\n A PROPOS OF THE WET SNOW\r\n\n When from dark error's subjugation\r\n My words of passionate exhortation\r\n Had wrenched thy fainting spirit free;\r\n And writhing prone in thine affliction\r\n Thou didst recall with malediction\r\n The vice that had encompassed thee:\r\n And when thy slumbering conscience, fretting\r\n By recollection's torturing flame,\r\n Thou didst reveal the hideous setting\r\n Of thy life's current ere I came:\r\n When suddenly I saw thee sicken,\r\n And weeping, hide thine anguished face,\r\n Revolted, maddened, horror-stricken,\r\n At memories of foul disgrace.\r\n\r\n NEKRASSOV (_translated by Juliet Soskice_).\r\n\nI\r\n\r\nAt that time I was only twenty-four. My life was even then gloomy,\r\nill-regulated, and as solitary as that of a savage. I made friends with\r\nno one and positively avoided talking, and buried myself more and more\r\nin my hole. At work in the office I never looked at any one, and I was\r\nperfectly well aware that my companions looked upon me, not only as a\r\nqueer fellow, but even looked upon me--I always fancied this--with a\r\nsort of loathing. I sometimes wondered why it was that nobody except me\r\nfancied that he was looked upon with aversion? One of the clerks had a\r\nmost repulsive, pock-marked face, which looked positively villainous. I\r\nbelieve I should not have dared to look at any one with such an\r\nunsightly countenance. Another had such a very dirty old uniform that\r\nthere was an unpleasant odour in his proximity. Yet not one of these\r\ngentlemen showed the slightest self-consciousness--either about their\r\nclothes or their countenance or their character in any way. Neither of\r\nthem ever imagined that they were looked at with repulsion; if they had\r\nimagined it they would not have minded--so long as their superiors did\r\nnot look at them in that way. It is clear to me now that, owing to my\r\nunbounded vanity and to the high standard I set for myself, I often\r\nlooked at myself with furious discontent, which verged on loathing, and\r\nso I inwardly attributed the same feeling to every one. I hated my face,\r\nfor instance: I thought it disgusting, and even suspected that there was\r\nsomething base in my expression, and so every day when I turned up at\r\nthe office I tried to behave as independently as possible, and to assume\r\na lofty expression, so that I might not be suspected of being abject.\r\n\"My face may be ugly,\" I thought, \"but let it be lofty, expressive, and,\r\nabove all, _extremely_ intelligent.\" But I was positively and painfully\r\ncertain that it was impossible for my countenance ever to express those\r\nqualities. And what was worst of all, I thought it actually stupid\r\nlooking, and I would have been quite satisfied if I could have looked\r\nintelligent. In fact, I would even have put up with looking base if, at\r\nthe same time, my face could have been thought strikingly intelligent.\r\n\r\nOf course, I hated my fellow clerks one and all, and I despised them\r\nall, yet at the same time I was, as it were, afraid of them. In fact, it\r\nhappened at times that I thought more highly of them than of myself. It\r\nsomehow happened quite suddenly that I alternated between despising them\r\nand thinking them superior to myself. A cultivated and decent man cannot\r\nbe vain without setting a fearfully high standard for himself, and\r\nwithout despising and almost hating himself at certain moments. But\r\nwhether I despised them or thought them superior I dropped my eyes\r\nalmost every time I met any one. I even made experiments whether I could\r\nface so and so's looking at me, and I was always the first to drop my\r\neyes. This worried me to distraction. I had a sickly dread, too, of\r\nbeing ridiculous, and so had a slavish passion for the conventional in\r\neverything external. I loved to fall into the common rut, and had a\r\nwhole-hearted terror of any kind of eccentricity in myself. But how\r\ncould I live up to it? I was morbidly sensitive, as a man of our age\r\nshould be. They were all stupid, and as like one another as so many\r\nsheep. Perhaps I was the only one in the office who fancied that I was a\r\ncoward and a slave, and I fancied it just because I was more highly\r\ndeveloped. But it was not only that I fancied it, it really was so. I\r\nwas a coward and a slave. I say this without the slightest\r\nembarrassment. Every decent man of our age must be a coward and a slave.\r\nThat is his normal condition. Of that I am firmly persuaded. He is made\r\nand constructed to that very end. And not only at the present time owing\r\nto some casual circumstances, but always, at all times, a decent man is\r\nbound to be a coward and a slave. It is the law of nature for all decent\r\npeople all over the earth. If any one of them happens to be valiant\r\nabout something, he need not be comforted nor carried away by that; he\r\nwould show the white feather just the same before something else. That\r\nis how it invariably and inevitably ends. Only donkeys and mules are\r\nvaliant, and they only till they are pushed up to the wall. It is not\r\nworth while to pay attention to them for they really are of no\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance, too, worried me in those days: that there was no\r\none like me and I was unlike any one else. \"I am alone and they are\r\n_every one_,\" I thought--and pondered.\r\n\r\nFrom that it is evident that I was still a youngster.\r\n\r\nThe very opposite sometimes happened. It was loathsome sometimes to go\r\nto the office; things reached such a point that I often came home ill.\r\nBut all at once, _a propos_ of nothing, there would come a phase of\r\nscepticism and indifference (everything happened in phases to me), and I\r\nwould laugh myself at my intolerance and fastidiousness, I would\r\nreproach myself with being _romantic_. At one time I was unwilling to\r\nspeak to any one, while at other times I would not only talk, but go to\r\nthe length of contemplating making friends with them. All my\r\nfastidiousness would suddenly, for no rhyme or reason, vanish. Who\r\nknows, perhaps I never had really had it, and it had simply been\r\naffected, and got out of books. I have not decided that question even\r\nnow. Once I quite made friends with them, visited their homes, played\r\npreference, drank vodka, talked of promotions.... But here let me make a\r\ndigression.\r\n\r\nWe Russians, speaking generally, have never had those foolish\r\ntranscendental \"romantics\"--German, and still more French--on whom\r\nnothing produces any effect; if there were an earthquake, if all France\r\nperished at the barricades, they would still be the same, they would not\r\neven have the decency to affect a change, but would still go on singing\r\ntheir transcendental songs to the hour of their death, because they are\r\nfools. We, in Russia, have no fools; that is well known. That is what\r\ndistinguishes us from foreign lands. Consequently these transcendental\r\nnatures are not found amongst us in their pure form. The idea that they\r\nare is due to our \"realistic\" journalists and critics of that day,\r\nalways on the look out for Kostanzhoglos and Uncle Pyotr Ivanitchs and\r\nfoolishly accepting them as our ideal; they have slandered our\r\nromantics, taking them for the same transcendental sort as in Germany or\r\nFrance. On the contrary, the characteristics of our \"romantics\" are\r\nabsolutely and directly opposed to the transcendental European type, and\r\nno European standard can be applied to them. (Allow me to make use of\r\nthis word \"romantic\"--an old-fashioned and much respected word which has\r\ndone good service and is familiar to all). The characteristics of our\r\nromantic are to understand everything, _to see everything and to see it\r\noften incomparably more clearly than our most realistic minds see it_;\r\nto refuse to accept anyone or anything, but at the same time not to\r\ndespise anything; to give way, to yield, from policy; never to lose\r\nsight of a useful practical object (such as rent-free quarters at the\r\ngovernment expense, pensions, decorations), to keep their eye on that\r\nobject through all the enthusiasms and volumes of lyrical poems, and at\r\nthe same time to preserve \"the good and the beautiful\" inviolate within\r\nthem to the hour of their death, and to preserve themselves also,\r\nincidentally, like some precious jewel wrapped in cotton wool if only\r\nfor the benefit of \"the good and the beautiful.\" Our \"romantic\" is a man\r\nof great breadth and the greatest rogue of all our rogues, I assure\r\nyou.... I can assure you from experience, indeed. Of course, that is, if\r\nhe is intelligent. But what am I saying! The romantic is always\r\nintelligent, and I only meant to observe that although we have had\r\nfoolish romantics they don't count, and they were only so because in the\r\nflower of their youth they degenerated into Germans, and to preserve\r\ntheir precious jewel more comfortably, settled somewhere out there--by\r\npreference in Weimar or the Black Forest.\r\n\r\nI, for instance, genuinely despised my official work and did not openly\r\nabuse it simply because I was in it myself and got a salary for it.\r\nAnyway, take note, I did not openly abuse it. Our romantic would rather\r\ngo out of his mind--a thing, however, which very rarely happens--than\r\ntake to open abuse, unless he had some other career in view; and he is\r\nnever kicked out. At most, they would take him to the lunatic asylum as\r\n\"the King of Spain\" if he should go very mad. But it is only the thin,\r\nfair people who go out of their minds in Russia. Innumerable \"romantics\"\r\nattain later in life to considerable rank in the service. Their\r\nmany-sidedness is remarkable! And what a faculty they have for the most\r\ncontradictory sensations! I was comforted by this thought even in those\r\ndays, and I am of the same opinion now. That is why there are so many\r\n\"broad natures\" among us who never lose their ideal even in the depths\r\nof degradation; and though they never stir a finger for their ideal,\r\nthough they are arrant thieves and knaves, yet they tearfully cherish\r\ntheir first ideal and are extraordinarily honest at heart. Yes, it is\r\nonly among us that the most incorrigible rogue can be absolutely and\r\nloftily honest at heart without in the least ceasing to be a rogue. I\r\nrepeat, our romantics, frequently, become such accomplished rascals (I\r\nuse the term \"rascals\" affectionately), suddenly display such a sense of\r\nreality and practical knowledge that their bewildered superiors and the\r\npublic generally can only ejaculate in amazement.\r\n\r\nTheir many-sidedness is really amazing, and goodness knows what it may\r\ndevelop into later on, and what the future has in store for us. It is\r\nnot a poor material! I do not say this from any foolish or boastful\r\npatriotism. But I feel sure that you are again imagining that I am\r\njoking. Or perhaps it's just the contrary, and you are convinced that I\r\nreally think so. Anyway, gentlemen, I shall welcome both views as an\r\nhonour and a special favour. And do forgive my digression.\r\n\r\nI did not, of course, maintain friendly relations with my comrades and\r\nsoon was at loggerheads with them, and in my youth and inexperience I\r\neven gave up bowing to them, as though I had cut off all relations.\r\nThat, however, only happened to me once. As a rule, I was always alone.\r\n\r\nIn the first place I spent most of my time at home, reading. I tried to\r\nstifle all that was continually seething within me by means of external\r\nimpressions. And the only external means I had was reading. Reading, of\r\ncourse, was a great help--exciting me, giving me pleasure and pain. But\r\nat times it bored me fearfully. One longed for movement in spite of\r\neverything, and I plunged all at once into dark, underground, loathsome\r\nvice of the pettiest kind. My wretched passions were acute, smarting,\r\nfrom my continual, sickly irritability. I had hysterical impulses, with\r\ntears and convulsions. I had no resource except reading, that is, there\r\nwas nothing in my surroundings which I could respect and which attracted\r\nme. I was overwhelmed with depression, too; I had an hysterical craving\r\nfor incongruity and for contrast, and so I took to vice. I have not said\r\nall this to justify myself.... But, no! I am lying. I did want to\r\njustify myself. I make that little observation for my own benefit,\r\ngentlemen. I don't want to lie. I vowed to myself I would not.\r\n\r\nAnd so, furtively, timidly, in solitude, at night, I indulged in filthy\r\nvice, with a feeling of shame which never deserted me, even at the most\r\nloathsome moments, and which at such moments nearly made me curse.\r\nAlready even then I had my underground world in my soul. I was fearfully\r\nafraid of being seen, of being met, of being recognized. I visited\r\nvarious obscure haunts.\r\n\r\nOne night as I was passing a tavern I saw through a lighted window some\r\ngentlemen fighting with billiard cues, and saw one of them thrown out of\r\nwindow. At other times I should have felt very much disgusted, but I was\r\nin such a mood at the time, that I actually envied the gentleman thrown\r\nout of window--and I envied him so much that I even went into the tavern\r\nand into the billiard-room. \"Perhaps,\" I thought, \"I'll have a fight,\r\ntoo, and they'll throw me out of window.\"\r\n\r\nI was not drunk--but what is one to do--depression will drive a man to\r\nsuch a pitch of hysteria? But nothing happened. It seemed that I was not\r\neven equal to being thrown out of window and I went away without having\r\nmy fight.\r\n\r\nAn officer put me in my place from the first moment.\r\n\r\nI was standing by the billiard-table and in my ignorance blocking up the\r\nway, and he wanted to pass; he took me by the shoulders and without a\r\nword--without a warning or explanation--moved me from where I was\r\nstanding to another spot and passed by as though he had not noticed me.\r\nI could have forgiven blows, but I could not forgive his having moved me\r\nwithout noticing me.\r\n\r\nDevil knows what I would have given for a real regular quarrel--a more\r\ndecent, a more _literary_ one, so to speak. I had been treated like a\r\nfly. This officer was over six foot, while I was a spindly little\r\nfellow. But the quarrel was in my hands. I had only to protest and I\r\ncertainly would have been thrown out of the window. But I changed my\r\nmind and preferred to beat a resentful retreat.\r\n\r\nI went out of the tavern straight home, confused and troubled, and the\r\nnext night I went out again with the same lewd intentions, still more\r\nfurtively, abjectly and miserably than before, as it were, with tears in\r\nmy eyes--but still I did go out again. Don't imagine, though, it was\r\ncowardice made me slink away from the officer: I never have been a\r\ncoward at heart, though I have always been a coward in action. Don't be\r\nin a hurry to laugh--I assure you I can explain it all.\r\n\r\nOh, if only that officer had been one of the sort who would consent to\r\nfight a duel! But no, he was one of those gentlemen (alas, long\r\nextinct!) who preferred fighting with cues or, like Gogol's Lieutenant\r\nPirogov, appealing to the police. They did not fight duels and would\r\nhave thought a duel with a civilian like me an utterly unseemly\r\nprocedure in any case--and they looked upon the duel altogether as\r\nsomething impossible, something free-thinking and French. But they were\r\nquite ready to bully, especially when they were over six foot.\r\n\r\nI did not slink away through cowardice, but through an unbounded vanity.\r\nI was afraid not of his six foot, not of getting a sound thrashing and\r\nbeing thrown out of the window; I should have had physical courage\r\nenough, I assure you; but I had not the moral courage. What I was afraid\r\nof was that every one present, from the insolent marker down to the\r\nlowest little stinking, pimply clerk in a greasy collar, would jeer at\r\nme and fail to understand when I began to protest and to address them in\r\nliterary language. For of the point of honour--not of honour, but of the\r\npoint of honour (_point d'honneur_)--one cannot speak among us except in\r\nliterary language. You can't allude to the \"point of honour\" in ordinary\r\nlanguage. I was fully convinced (the sense of reality, in spite of all\r\nmy romanticism!) that they would all simply split their sides with\r\nlaughter, and that the officer would not simply beat me, that is,\r\nwithout insulting me, but would certainly prod me in the back with his\r\nknee, kick me round the billiard table, and only then perhaps have pity\r\nand drop me out of the window.\r\n\r\nOf course, this trivial incident could not with me end in that. I often\r\nmet that officer afterwards in the street and noticed him very\r\ncarefully. I am not quite sure whether he recognized me, I imagine not;\r\nI judge from certain signs. But I--I stared at him with spite and hatred\r\nand so it went on ... for several years! My resentment grew even deeper\r\nwith years. At first I began making stealthy inquiries about this\r\nofficer. It was difficult for me to do so, for I knew no one. But one\r\nday I heard some one shout his surname in the street as I was following\r\nhim at a distance, as though I were tied to him--and so I learnt his\r\nsurname. Another time I followed him to his flat, and for ten kopecks\r\nlearned from the porter where he lived, on which storey, whether he\r\nlived alone or with others, and so on--in fact, everything one could\r\nlearn from a porter. One morning, though I had never tried my hand with\r\nthe pen, it suddenly occurred to me to write a satire on this officer in\r\nthe form of a novel which would unmask his villainy. I wrote the novel\r\nwith relish. I did unmask his villainy, I even exaggerated it; at first\r\nI so altered his surname that it could easily be recognized, but on\r\nsecond thoughts I changed it, and sent the story to the\r\n_Otetchestvenniya Zapiski_. But at that time such attacks were not the\r\nfashion and my story was not printed. That was a great vexation to me.\r\n\r\nSometimes I was positively choked with resentment. At last I determined\r\nto challenge my enemy to a duel. I composed a splendid, charming letter\r\nto him, imploring him to apologize to me, and hinting rather plainly at\r\na duel in case of refusal. The letter was so composed that if the\r\nofficer had had the least understanding of the good and the beautiful he\r\nwould certainly have flung himself on my neck and have offered me his\r\nfriendship. And how fine that would have been! How we should have got on\r\ntogether! \"He could have shielded me with his higher rank, while I could\r\nhave improved his mind with my culture, and, well ... my ideas, and all\r\nsorts of things might have happened.\" Only fancy, this was two years\r\nafter his insult to me, and my challenge would have been a ridiculous\r\nanachronism, in spite of all the ingenuity of my letter in disguising\r\nand explaining away the anachronism. But, thank God (to this day I thank\r\nthe Almighty with tears in my eyes) I did not send the letter to him.\r\nCold shivers run down my back when I think of what might have happened\r\nif I had sent it.\r\n\r\nAnd all at once I revenged myself in the simplest way, by a stroke of\r\ngenius! A brilliant thought suddenly dawned upon me. Sometimes on\r\nholidays I used to stroll along the sunny side of the Nevsky about four\r\no'clock in the afternoon. Though it was hardly a stroll so much as a\r\nseries of innumerable miseries, humiliations and resentments; but no\r\ndoubt that was just what I wanted. I used to wriggle along in a most\r\nunseemly fashion, like an eel, continually moving aside to make way for\r\ngenerals, for officers of the guards and the hussars, or for ladies. At\r\nsuch minutes there used to be a convulsive twinge at my heart, and I\r\nused to feel hot all down my back at the mere thought of the\r\nwretchedness of my attire, of the wretchedness and abjectness of my\r\nlittle scurrying figure. This was a regular martyrdom, a continual,\r\nintolerable humiliation at the thought, which passed into an incessant\r\nand direct sensation, that I was a mere fly in the eyes of all this\r\nworld, a nasty, disgusting fly--more intelligent, more highly developed,\r\nmore refined in feeling than any of them, of course--but a fly that was\r\ncontinually making way for every one, insulted and injured by every one.\r\nWhy I inflicted this torture upon myself, why I went to the Nevsky, I\r\ndon't know. I felt simply drawn there at every possible opportunity.\r\n\r\nAlready then I began to experience a rush of the enjoyment of which I\r\nspoke in the first chapter. After my affair with the officer I felt even\r\nmore drawn there than before: it was on the Nevsky that I met him most\r\nfrequently, there I could admire him. He, too, went there chiefly on\r\nholidays. He, too, turned out of his path for generals and persons of\r\nhigh rank, and he, too, wriggled between them like an eel; but people,\r\nlike me, or even better dressed like me, he simply walked over; he made\r\nstraight for them as though there was nothing but empty space before\r\nhim, and never, under any circumstances, turned aside. I gloated over my\r\nresentment watching him and ... always resentfully made way for him. It\r\nexasperated me that even in the street I could not be on an even footing\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n\"Why must you invariably be the first to move aside?\" I kept asking\r\nmyself in hysterical rage, waking up sometimes at three o'clock in the\r\nmorning. \"Why is it you and not he? There's no regulation about it;\r\nthere's no written law. Let the making way be equal as it usually is\r\nwhen refined people meet: he moves half-way and you move half-way; you\r\npass with mutual respect.\"\r\n\r\nBut that never happened, and I always moved aside, while he did not even\r\nnotice my making way for him. And lo and behold a bright idea dawned\r\nupon me! \"What,\" I thought, \"if I meet him and don't move on one side?\r\nWhat if I don't move aside on purpose, even if I knock up against him?\r\nHow would that be?\" This audacious idea took such a hold on me that it\r\ngave me no peace. I was dreaming of it continually, horribly, and I\r\npurposely went more frequently to the Nevsky in order to picture more\r\nvividly how I should do it when I did do it. I was delighted. This\r\nintention seemed to me more and more practical and possible.\r\n\r\n\"Of course I shall not really push him,\" I thought, already more\r\ngood-natured in my joy. \"I will simply not turn aside, will run up\r\nagainst him, not very violently, but just shouldering each other--just\r\nas much as decency permits. I will push against him just as much as he\r\npushes against me.\" At last I made up my mind completely. But my\r\npreparations took a great deal of time. To begin with, when I carried\r\nout my plan I should need to be looking rather more decent, and so I had\r\nto think of my get-up. \"In case of emergency, if, for instance, there\r\nwere any sort of public scandal (and the public there is of the most\r\n_recherche_: the Countess walks there; Prince D. walks there; all the\r\nliterary world is there), I must be well dressed; that inspires respect\r\nand of itself puts us on an equal footing in the eyes of society.\"\r\n\r\nWith this object I asked for some of my salary in advance, and bought at\r\nTchurkin's a pair of black gloves and a decent hat. Black gloves seemed\r\nto me both more dignified and _bon ton_ than the lemon-coloured ones\r\nwhich I had contemplated at first. \"The colour is too gaudy, it looks as\r\nthough one were trying to be conspicuous,\" and I did not take the\r\nlemon-coloured ones. I had got ready long beforehand a good shirt, with\r\nwhite bone studs; my overcoat was the only thing that held me back. The\r\ncoat in itself was a very good one, it kept me warm; but it was wadded\r\nand it had a raccoon collar which was the height of vulgarity. I had to\r\nchange the collar at any sacrifice, and to have a beaver one like an\r\nofficer's. For this purpose I began visiting the Gostiny Dvor and after\r\nseveral attempts I pitched upon a piece of cheap German beaver. Though\r\nthese German beavers soon grow shabby and look wretched, yet at first\r\nthey look exceedingly well, and I only needed it for one occasion. I\r\nasked the price; even so, it was too expensive. After thinking it over\r\nthoroughly I decided to sell my raccoon collar. The rest of the money--a\r\nconsiderable sum for me, I decided to borrow from Anton Antonitch\r\nSyetotchkin, my immediate superior, an unassuming person, though grave\r\nand judicious. He never lent money to any one, but I had, on entering\r\nthe service, been specially recommended to him by an important personage\r\nwho had got me my berth. I was horribly worried. To borrow from Anton\r\nAntonitch seemed to me monstrous and shameful. I did not sleep for two\r\nor three nights. Indeed, I did not sleep well at that time, I was in a\r\nfever; I had a vague sinking at my heart or else a sudden throbbing,\r\nthrobbing, throbbing! Anton Antonitch was surprised at first, then he\r\nfrowned, then he reflected, and did after all lend me the money,\r\nreceiving from me a written authorization to take from my salary a\r\nfortnight later the sum that he had lent me.\r\n\r\nIn this way everything was at last ready. The handsome beaver replaced\r\nthe mean-looking raccoon, and I began by degrees to get to work. It\r\nwould never have done to act off-hand, at random; the plan had to be\r\ncarried out skilfully, by degrees. But I must confess that after many\r\nefforts I began to despair: we simply could not run into each other. I\r\nmade every preparation, I was quite determined--it seemed as though we\r\nshould run into one another directly--and before I knew what I was doing\r\nI had stepped aside for him again and he had passed without noticing me.\r\nI even prayed as I approached him that God would grant me determination.\r\nOne time I had made up my mind thoroughly, but it ended in my stumbling\r\nand falling at his feet because at the very last instant when I was six\r\ninches from him my courage failed me. He very calmly stepped over me,\r\nwhile I flew on one side like a ball. That night I was ill again,\r\nfeverish and delirious.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly it ended most happily. The night before I had made up my\r\nmind not to carry out my fatal plan and to abandon it all, and with that\r\nobject I went to the Nevsky for the last time, just to see how I would\r\nabandon it all. Suddenly, three paces from my enemy, I unexpectedly made\r\nup my mind--I closed my eyes, and we ran full tilt, shoulder to\r\nshoulder, against one another! I did not budge an inch and passed him on\r\na perfectly equal footing! He did not even look round and pretended not\r\nto notice it; but he was only pretending, I am convinced of that. I am\r\nconvinced of that to this day! Of course, I got the worst of it--he was\r\nstronger, but that was not the point. The point was that I had attained\r\nmy object, I had kept up my dignity, I had not yielded a step, and had\r\nput myself publicly on an equal social footing with him. I returned home\r\nfeeling that I was fully avenged for everything. I was delighted. I was\r\ntriumphant and sang Italian arias. Of course, I will not describe to you\r\nwhat happened to me three days later; if you have read my first chapter\r\nyou can guess that for yourself. The officer was afterwards transferred;\r\nI have not seen him now for fourteen years. What is the dear fellow\r\ndoing now? Whom is he walking over?\r\n\nII\r\n\r\nBut the period of my dissipation would end and I always felt very sick\r\nafterwards. It was followed by remorse--I tried to drive it away: I felt\r\ntoo sick. By degrees, however, I grew used to that too. I grew used to\r\neverything, or rather I voluntarily resigned myself to enduring it. But\r\nI had a means of escape that reconciled everything--that was to find\r\nrefuge in \"the good and the beautiful,\" in dreams, of course. I was a\r\nterrible dreamer, I would dream for three months on end, tucked away in\r\nmy corner, and you may believe me that at those moments I had no\r\nresemblance to the gentleman who, in the perturbation of his chicken\r\nheart, put a collar of German beaver on his great coat. I suddenly\r\nbecame a hero. I would not have admitted my six-foot lieutenant even if\r\nhe had called on me. I could not even picture him before me then. What\r\nwere my dreams and how I could satisfy myself with them--it is hard to\r\nsay now, but at the time I was satisfied with them. Though, indeed, even\r\nnow, I am to some extent satisfied with them. Dreams were particularly\r\nsweet and vivid after a spell of dissipation; they came with remorse and\r\nwith tears, with curses and transports. There were moments of such\r\npositive intoxication, of such happiness, that there was not the\r\nfaintest trace of irony within me, on my honour. I had faith, hope,\r\nlove. I believed blindly at such times that by some miracle, by some\r\nexternal circumstance, all this would suddenly open out, expand; that\r\nsuddenly a vista of suitable activity--beneficent, good, and, above all,\r\n_ready made_ (what sort of activity I had no idea, but the great thing\r\nwas that it should be all ready for me)--would rise up before me--and I\r\nshould come out into the light of day, almost riding a white horse and\r\ncrowned with laurel. Anything but the foremost place I could not\r\nconceive for myself, and for that very reason I quite contentedly\r\noccupied the lowest in reality. Either to be a hero or to grovel in the\r\nmud--there was nothing between. That was my ruin, for when I was in the\r\nmud I comforted myself with the thought that at other times I was a\r\nhero, and the hero was a cloak for the mud: for an ordinary man it was\r\nshameful to defile himself, but a hero was too lofty to be utterly\r\ndefiled, and so he might defile himself. It is worth noting that these\r\nattacks of the \"good and the beautiful\" visited me even during the\r\nperiod of dissipation and just at the times when I was touching the\r\nbottom. They came in separate spurts, as though reminding me of\r\nthemselves, but did not banish the dissipation by their appearance. On\r\nthe contrary, they seemed to add a zest to it by contrast, and were only\r\nsufficiently present to serve as an appetizing sauce. That sauce was\r\nmade up of contradictions and sufferings, of agonizing inward analysis\r\nand all these pangs and pin-pricks gave a certain piquancy, even a\r\nsignificance to my dissipation--in fact, completely answered the purpose\r\nof an appetizing sauce. There was a certain depth of meaning in it. And\r\nI could hardly have resigned myself to the simple, vulgar, direct\r\ndebauchery of a clerk and have endured all the filthiness of it. What\r\ncould have allured me about it then and have drawn me at night into the\r\nstreet? No, I had a lofty way of getting out of it all.\r\n\r\nAnd what loving-kindness, oh Lord, what loving-kindness I felt at times\r\nin those dreams of mine! in those \"flights into the good and the\r\nbeautiful;\" though it was fantastic love, though it was never applied to\r\nanything human in reality, yet there was so much of this love that one\r\ndid not feel afterwards even the impulse to apply it in reality; that\r\nwould have been superfluous. Everything, however, passed satisfactorily\r\nby a lazy and fascinating transition into the sphere of art, that is,\r\ninto the beautiful forms of life, lying ready, largely stolen from the\r\npoets and novelists and adapted to all sorts of needs and uses. I, for\r\ninstance, was triumphant over every one; every one, of course, was in\r\ndust and ashes, and was forced spontaneously to recognize my\r\nsuperiority, and I forgave them all. I was a poet and a grand gentleman,\r\nI fell in love; I came in for countless millions and immediately devoted\r\nthem to humanity, and at the same time I confessed before all the people\r\nmy shameful deeds, which, of course, were not merely shameful, but had\r\nin them much that was \"good and beautiful,\" something in the Manfred\r\nstyle. Every one would kiss me and weep (what idiots they would be if\r\nthey did not), while I should go barefoot and hungry preaching new ideas\r\nand fighting a victorious Austerlitz against the obscurantists. Then the\r\nband would play a march, an amnesty would be declared, the Pope would\r\nagree to retire from Rome to Brazil; then there would be a ball for the\r\nwhole of Italy at the Villa Borghese on the shores of the Lake of Como,\r\nthe Lake of Como being for that purpose transferred to the neighbourhood\r\nof Rome; then would come a scene in the bushes, and so on, and so on--as\r\nthough you did not know all about it? You will say that it is vulgar and\r\ncontemptible to drag all this into public after all the tears and\r\ntransports which I have myself confessed. But why is it contemptible?\r\nCan you imagine that I am ashamed of it all, and that it was stupider\r\nthan anything in your life, gentlemen? And I can assure you that some of\r\nthese fancies were by no means badly composed.... It did not all happen\r\non the shores of Lake Como. And yet you are right--it really is vulgar\r\nand contemptible. And most contemptible of all it is that now I am\r\nattempting to justify myself to you. And even more contemptible than\r\nthat is my making this remark now. But that's enough, or there will be\r\nno end to it: each step will be more contemptible than the last....\r\n\r\nI could never stand more than three months of dreaming at a time without\r\nfeeling an irresistible desire to plunge into society. To plunge into\r\nsociety meant to visit my superior at the office, Anton Antonitch\r\nSyetotchkin. He was the only permanent acquaintance I have had in my\r\nlife, and wonder at the fact myself now. But I only went to see him when\r\nthat phase came over me, and when my dreams had reached such a point of\r\nbliss that it became essential at once to embrace my fellows and all\r\nmankind; and for that purpose I needed, at least, one human being,\r\nactually existing. I had to call on Anton Antonitch, however, on\r\nTuesday--his at-home day; so I had always to time my passionate desire\r\nto embrace humanity so that it might fall on a Tuesday.\r\n\r\nThis Anton Antonitch lived on the fourth storey in a house in Five\r\nCorners, in four low-pitched rooms, one smaller than the other, of a\r\nparticularly frugal and sallow appearance. He had two daughters and\r\ntheir aunt, who used to pour out the tea. Of the daughters one was\r\nthirteen and another fourteen, they both had snub noses, and I was\r\nawfully shy of them because they were always whispering and giggling\r\ntogether. The master of the house usually sat in his study on a leather\r\ncouch in front of the table with some grey-headed gentleman, usually a\r\ncolleague from our office or some other department. I never saw more\r\nthan two or three visitors there, always the same. They talked about the\r\nexcise duty; about business in the senate, about salaries, about\r\npromotions, about His Excellency, and the best means of pleasing him,\r\nand so on. I had the patience to sit like a fool beside these people for\r\nfour hours at a stretch, listening to them without knowing what to say\r\nto them or venturing to say a word. I became stupified, several times I\r\nfelt myself perspiring, I was overcome by a sort of paralysis; but this\r\nwas pleasant and good for me. On returning home I deferred for a time my\r\ndesire to embrace all mankind.\r\n\r\nI had however one other acquaintance of a sort, Simonov, who was an old\r\nschoolfellow. I had a number of schoolfellows indeed in Petersburg, but\r\nI did not associate with them and had even given up nodding to them in\r\nthe street. I believe I had transferred into the department I was in\r\nsimply to avoid their company and to cut off all connection with my\r\nhateful childhood. Curses on that school and all those terrible years of\r\npenal servitude! In short, I parted from my schoolfellows as soon as I\r\ngot out into the world. There were two or three left to whom I nodded in\r\nthe street. One of them was Simonov, who had been in no way\r\ndistinguished at school, was of a quiet and equable disposition; but I\r\ndiscovered in him a certain independence of character and even honesty.\r\nI don't even suppose that he was particularly stupid. I had at one time\r\nspent some rather soulful moments with him, but these had not lasted\r\nlong and had somehow been suddenly clouded over. He was evidently\r\nuncomfortable at these reminiscences, and was, I fancy, always afraid\r\nthat I might take up the same tone again. I suspected that he had an\r\naversion for me, but still I went on going to see him, not being quite\r\ncertain of it.\r\n\r\nAnd so on one occasion, unable to endure my solitude and knowing that as\r\nit was Thursday Anton Antonitch's door would be closed, I thought of\r\nSimonov. Climbing up to his fourth storey I was thinking that the man\r\ndisliked me and that it was a mistake to go and see him. But as it\r\nalways happened that such reflections impelled me, as though purposely,\r\nto put myself into a false position, I went in. It was almost a year\r\nsince I had last seen Simonov.\r\n\nIII\r\n\r\nI found two of my old schoolfellows with him. They seemed to be\r\ndiscussing an important matter. All of them took scarcely any notice of\r\nmy entrance, which was strange, for I had not met them for years.\r\nEvidently they looked upon me as something on the level of a common fly.\r\nI had not been treated like that even at school, though they all hated\r\nme. I knew, of course, that they must despise me now for my lack of\r\nsuccess in the service, and for my having let myself sink so low, going\r\nabout badly dressed and so on--which seemed to them a sign of my\r\nincapacity and insignificance. But I had not expected such contempt.\r\nSimonov was positively surprised at my turning up. Even in old days he\r\nhad always seemed surprised at my coming. All this disconcerted me: I\r\nsat down, feeling rather miserable, and began listening to what they\r\nwere saying.\r\n\r\nThey were engaged in warm and earnest conversation about a farewell\r\ndinner which they wanted to arrange for the next day to a comrade of\r\ntheirs called Zverkov, an officer in the army, who was going away to a\r\ndistant province. This Zverkov had been all the time at school with me\r\ntoo. I had begun to hate him particularly in the upper forms. In the\r\nlower forms he had simply been a pretty, playful boy whom everybody\r\nliked. I had hated him, however, even in the lower forms, just because\r\nhe was a pretty and playful boy. He was always bad at his lessons and\r\ngot worse and worse as he went on; however, he left with a good\r\ncertificate, as he had powerful interest. During his last year at school\r\nhe came in for an estate of two hundred serfs, and as almost all of us\r\nwere poor he took up a swaggering tone among us. He was vulgar in the\r\nextreme, but at the same time he was a good-natured fellow, even in his\r\nswaggering. In spite of superficial, fantastic and sham notions of\r\nhonour and dignity, all but very few of us positively grovelled before\r\nZverkov, and the more so the more he swaggered. And it was not from any\r\ninterested motive that they grovelled, but simply because he had been\r\nfavoured by the gifts of nature. Moreover, it was, as it were, an\r\naccepted idea among us that Zverkov was a specialist in regard to tact\r\nand the social graces. This last fact particularly infuriated me. I\r\nhated the abrupt self-confident tone of his voice, his admiration of his\r\nown witticisms, which were often frightfully stupid, though he was bold\r\nin his language; I hated his handsome, but stupid face (for which I\r\nwould, however, have gladly exchanged my intelligent one), and the\r\nfree-and-easy military manners in fashion in the \"'forties.\" I hated the\r\nway in which he used to talk of his future conquests of women (he did\r\nnot venture to begin his attack upon women until he had the epaulettes\r\nof an officer, and was looking forward to them with impatience), and\r\nboasted of the duels he would constantly be fighting. I remember how I,\r\ninvariably so taciturn, suddenly fastened upon Zverkov, when one day\r\ntalking at a leisure moment with his schoolfellows of his future\r\nrelations with the fair sex, and growing as sportive as a puppy in the\r\nsun, he all at once declared that he would not leave a single village\r\ngirl on his estate unnoticed, that that was his _droit de seigneur_, and\r\nthat if the peasants dared to protest he would have them all flogged and\r\ndouble the tax on them, the bearded rascals. Our servile rabble\r\napplauded, but I attacked him, not from compassion for the girls and\r\ntheir fathers, but simply because they were applauding such an insect. I\r\ngot the better of him on that occasion, but though Zverkov was stupid he\r\nwas lively and impudent, and so laughed it off, and in such a way that\r\nmy victory was not really complete: the laugh was on his side. He got\r\nthe better of me on several occasions afterwards, but without malice,\r\njestingly, casually. I remained angrily and contemptuously silent and\r\nwould not answer him. When we left school he made advances to me; I did\r\nnot rebuff them, for I was flattered, but we soon parted and quite\r\nnaturally. Afterwards I heard of his barrack-room success as a\r\nlieutenant, and of the fast life he was leading. Then there came other\r\nrumours--of his successes in the service. By then he had taken to\r\ncutting me in the street, and I suspected that he was afraid of\r\ncompromising himself by greeting a personage as insignificant as me. I\r\nsaw him once in the theatre, in the third tier of boxes. By then he was\r\nwearing shoulder-straps. He was twisting and twirling about,\r\ningratiating himself with the daughters of an ancient General. In three\r\nyears he had gone off considerably, though he was still rather handsome\r\nand adroit. One could see that by the time he was thirty he would be\r\ncorpulent. So it was to this Zverkov that my schoolfellows were going to\r\ngive a dinner on his departure. They had kept up with him for those\r\nthree years, though privately they did not consider themselves on an\r\nequal footing with him, I am convinced of that.\r\n\r\nOf Simonov's two visitors, one was Ferfitchkin, a Russianized German--a\r\nlittle fellow with the face of a monkey, a blockhead who was always\r\nderiding every one, a very bitter enemy of mine from our days in the\r\nlower forms--a vulgar, impudent, swaggering fellow, who affected a most\r\nsensitive feeling of personal honour, though, of course, he was a\r\nwretched little coward at heart. He was one of those worshippers of\r\nZverkov who made up to the latter from interested motives, and often\r\nborrowed money from him. Simonov's other visitor, Trudolyubov, was a\r\nperson in no way remarkable--a tall young fellow, in the army, with a\r\ncold face, fairly honest, though he worshipped success of every sort,\r\nand was only capable of thinking of promotion. He was some sort of\r\ndistant relation of Zverkov's, and this, foolish as it seems, gave him a\r\ncertain importance among us. He always thought me of no consequence\r\nwhatever; his behaviour to me, though not quite courteous, was\r\ntolerable.\r\n\r\n\"Well, with seven roubles each,\" said Trudolyubov, \"twenty-one roubles\r\nbetween the three of us, we ought to be able to get a good dinner.\r\nZverkov, of course, won't pay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not, since we are inviting him,\" Simonov decided.\r\n\r\n\"Can you imagine,\" Ferfitchkin interrupted hotly and conceitedly, like\r\nsome insolent flunkey boasting of his master the General's decorations,\r\n\"can you imagine that Zverkov will let us pay alone? He will accept from\r\ndelicacy, but he will order half a dozen bottles of champagne.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do we want half a dozen for the four of us?\" observed Trudolyubov,\r\ntaking notice only of the half dozen.\r\n\r\n\"So the three of us, with Zverkov for the fourth, twenty-one roubles, at\r\nthe Hotel de Paris at five o'clock to-morrow,\" Simonov, who had been\r\nasked to make the arrangements, concluded finally.\r\n\r\n\"How twenty-one roubles?\" I asked in some agitation, with a show of\r\nbeing offended; \"if you count me it will not be twenty-one, but\r\ntwenty-eight roubles.\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that to invite myself so suddenly and unexpectedly would\r\nbe positively graceful, and that they would all be conquered at once and\r\nwould look at me with respect.\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to join, too?\" Simonov observed, with no appearance of\r\npleasure, seeming to avoid looking at me. He knew me through and\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nIt infuriated me that he knew me so thoroughly.\r\n\r\n\"Why not? I am an old schoolfellow of his, too, I believe, and I must\r\nown I feel hurt that you have left me out,\" I said, boiling over again.\r\n\r\n\"And where were we to find you?\" Ferfitchkin put in roughly.\r\n\r\n\"You never were on good terms with Zverkov,\" Trudolyubov added,\r\nfrowning.\r\n\r\nBut I had already clutched at the idea and would not give it up.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me that no one has a right to form an opinion upon that,\" I\r\nretorted in a shaking voice, as though something tremendous had\r\nhappened. \"Perhaps that is just my reason for wishing it now, that I\r\nhave not always been on good terms with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there's no making you out ... with these refinements,\" Trudolyubov\r\njeered.\r\n\r\n\"We'll put your name down,\" Simonov decided, addressing me. \"To-morrow\r\nat five o'clock at the Hotel de Paris.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about the money?\" Ferfitchkin began in an undertone, indicating me\r\nto Simonov, but he broke off, for even Simonov was embarrassed.\r\n\r\n\"That will do,\" said Trudolyubov, getting up. \"If he wants to come so\r\nmuch, let him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it's a private thing, between us friends,\" Ferfitchkin said\r\ncrossly, as he, too, picked up his hat. \"It's not an official\r\ngathering.\"\r\n\r\n\"We do not want at all, perhaps....\"\r\n\r\nThey went away. Ferfitchkin did not greet me in any way as he went out,\r\nTrudolyubov barely nodded. Simonov, with whom I was left _tete-a-tete_,\r\nwas in a state of vexation and perplexity, and looked at me queerly. He\r\ndid not sit down and did not ask me to.\r\n\r\n\"H'm ... yes ... to-morrow, then. Will you pay your subscription now? I\r\njust ask so as to know,\" he muttered in embarrassment.\r\n\r\nI flushed crimson, and as I did so I remembered that I had owed Simonov\r\nfifteen roubles for ages--which I had, indeed, never forgotten, though I\r\nhad not paid it.\r\n\r\n\"You will understand, Simonov, that I could have no idea when I came\r\nhere.... I am very much vexed that I have forgotten....\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, all right, that doesn't matter. You can pay to-morrow after\r\nthe dinner. I simply wanted to know.... Please don't....\"\r\n\r\nHe broke off and began pacing the room still more vexed. As he walked he\r\nbegan to stamp with his heels.\r\n\r\n\"Am I keeping you?\" I asked, after two minutes of silence.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" he said, starting, \"that is--to be truthful--yes. I have to go and\r\nsee some one ... not far from here,\" he added in an apologetic voice,\r\nsomewhat abashed.\r\n\r\n\"My goodness, why didn't you say so?\" I cried, seizing my cap, with an\r\nastonishingly free-and-easy air, which was the last thing I should have\r\nexpected of myself.\r\n\r\n\"It's close by ... not two paces away,\" Simonov repeated, accompanying\r\nme to the front door with a fussy air which did not suit him at all. \"So\r\nfive o'clock, punctually, to-morrow,\" he called down the stairs after\r\nme. He was very glad to get rid of me. I was in a fury.\r\n\r\n\"What possessed me, what possessed me to force myself upon them?\" I\r\nwondered, grinding my teeth as I strode along the street, \"for a\r\nscoundrel, a pig like that Zverkov! Of course, I had better not go; of\r\ncourse, I must just snap my fingers at them. I am not bound in any way.\r\nI'll send Simonov a note by to-morrow's post....\"\r\n\r\nBut what made me furious was that I knew for certain that I should go,\r\nthat I should make a point of going; and the more tactless, the more\r\nunseemly my going would be, the more certainly I would go.\r\n\r\nAnd there was a positive obstacle to my going: I had no money. All I had\r\nwas nine roubles, I had to give seven of that to my servant, Apollon,\r\nfor his monthly wages. That was all I paid him--he had to keep himself.\r\n\r\nNot to pay him was impossible, considering his character. But I will\r\ntalk about that fellow, about that plague of mine, another time.\r\n\r\nHowever, I knew I should go and should not pay him his wages.\r\n\r\nThat night I had the most hideous dreams. No wonder; all the evening I\r\nhad been oppressed by memories of my miserable days at school, and I\r\ncould not shake them off. I was sent to the school by distant relations,\r\nupon whom I was dependent and of whom I have heard nothing since--they\r\nsent me there a forlorn, silent boy, already crushed by their\r\nreproaches, already troubled by doubt, and looking with savage distrust\r\nat every one. My schoolfellows met me with spiteful and merciless jibes\r\nbecause I was not like any of them. But I could not endure their taunts;\r\nI could not give in to them with the ignoble readiness with which they\r\ngave in to one another. I hated them from the first, and shut myself\r\naway from every one in timid, wounded and disproportionate pride. Their\r\ncoarseness revolted me. They laughed cynically at my face, at my clumsy\r\nfigure; and yet what stupid faces they had themselves. In our school the\r\nboys' faces seemed in a special way to degenerate and grow stupider. How\r\nmany fine-looking boys came to us! In a few years they became repulsive.\r\nEven at sixteen I wondered at them morosely; even then I was struck by\r\nthe pettiness of their thoughts, the stupidity of their pursuits, their\r\ngames, their conversations. They had no understanding of such essential\r\nthings, they took no interest in such striking, impressive subjects,\r\nthat I could not help considering them inferior to myself. It was not\r\nwounded vanity that drove me to it, and for God's sake do not thrust\r\nupon me your hackneyed remarks, repeated to nausea, that \"I was only a\r\ndreamer,\" while they even then had an understanding of life. They\r\nunderstood nothing, they had no idea of real life, and I swear that that\r\nwas what made me most indignant with them. On the contrary, the most\r\nobvious, striking reality they accepted with fantastic stupidity and\r\neven at that time were accustomed to respect success. Everything that\r\nwas just, but oppressed and looked down upon, they laughed at\r\nheartlessly and shamefully. They took rank for intelligence; even at\r\nsixteen they were already talking about a snug berth. Of course, a great\r\ndeal of it was due to their stupidity, to the bad examples with which\r\nthey had always been surrounded in their childhood and boyhood. They\r\nwere monstrously depraved. Of course a great deal of that, too, was\r\nsuperficial and an assumption of cynicism; of course there were glimpses\r\nof youth and freshness even in their depravity; but even that freshness\r\nwas not attractive, and showed itself in a certain rakishness. I hated\r\nthem horribly, though perhaps I was worse than any of them. They repaid\r\nme in the same way, and did not conceal their aversion for me. But by\r\nthen I did not desire their affection: on the contrary I continually\r\nlonged for their humiliation. To escape from their derision I purposely\r\nbegan to make all the progress I could with my studies and forced my way\r\nto the very top. This impressed them. Moreover, they all began by\r\ndegrees to grasp that I had already read books none of them could read,\r\nand understood things (not forming part of our school curriculum) of\r\nwhich they had not even heard. They took a savage and sarcastic view of\r\nit, but were morally impressed, especially as the teachers began to\r\nnotice me on those grounds. The mockery ceased, but the hostility\r\nremained, and cold and strained relations became permanent between us.\r\nIn the end I could not put up with it: with years a craving for society,\r\nfor friends, developed in me. I attempted to get on friendly terms with\r\nsome of my schoolfellows; but somehow or other my intimacy with them was\r\nalways strained and soon ended of itself. Once, indeed, I did have a\r\nfriend. But I was already a tyrant at heart; I wanted to exercise\r\nunbounded sway over him; I tried to instil into him a contempt for his\r\nsurroundings; I required of him a disdainful and complete break with\r\nthose surroundings. I frightened him with my passionate affection; I\r\nreduced him to tears, to hysterics. He was a simple and devoted soul;\r\nbut when he devoted himself to me entirely I began to hate him\r\nimmediately and repulsed him--as though all I needed him for was to win\r\na victory over him, to subjugate him and nothing else. But I could not\r\nsubjugate all of them; my friend was not at all like them either, he\r\nwas, in fact, a rare exception. The first thing I did on leaving school\r\nwas to give up the special job for which I had been destined so as to\r\nbreak all ties, to curse my past and shake the dust from off my feet....\r\nAnd goodness knows why, after all that, I should go trudging off to\r\nSimonov's!\r\n\r\nEarly next morning I roused myself and jumped out of bed with\r\nexcitement, as though it were all about to happen at once. But I\r\nbelieved that some radical change in my life was coming, and would\r\ninevitably come that day. Owing to its rarity, perhaps, any external\r\nevent, however trivial, always made me feel as though some radical\r\nchange in my life were at hand. I went to the office, however, as usual,\r\nbut sneaked away home two hours earlier to get ready. The great thing, I\r\nthought, is not to be the first to arrive, or they will think I am\r\noverjoyed at coming. But there were thousands of such great points to\r\nconsider, and they all agitated and overwhelmed me. I polished my boots\r\na second time with my own hands; nothing in the world would have induced\r\nApollon to clean them twice a day, as he considered that it was more\r\nthan his duties required of him. I stole the brushes to clean them from\r\nthe passage, being careful he should not detect it, for fear of his\r\ncontempt. Then I minutely examined my clothes and thought that\r\neverything looked old, worn and threadbare. I had let myself get too\r\nslovenly. My uniform, perhaps, was tidy, but I could not go out to\r\ndinner in my uniform. The worst of it was that on the knee of my\r\ntrousers was a big yellow stain. I had a foreboding that that stain\r\nwould deprive me of nine-tenths of my personal dignity. I knew, too,\r\nthat it was very poor to think so. \"But this is no time for thinking:\r\nnow I am in for the real thing,\" I thought, and my heart sank. I knew,\r\ntoo, perfectly well even then, that I was monstrously exaggerating the\r\nfacts. But how could I help it? I could not control myself and was\r\nalready shaking with fever. With despair I pictured to myself how coldly\r\nand disdainfully that \"scoundrel\" Zverkov would meet me; with what\r\ndull-witted, invincible contempt the blockhead Trudolyubov would look at\r\nme; with what impudent rudeness the insect Ferfitchkin would snigger at\r\nme in order to curry favour with Zverkov; how completely Simonov would\r\ntake it all in, and how he would despise me for the abjectness of my\r\nvanity and lack of spirit--and, worst of all, how paltry, _unliterary_,\r\ncommonplace it would all be. Of course, the best thing would be not to\r\ngo at all. But that was most impossible of all: if I feel impelled to do\r\nanything, I seem to be pitchforked into it. I should have jeered at\r\nmyself ever afterwards: \"So you funked it, you funked it, you funked the\r\n_real thing_!\" On the contrary, I passionately longed to show all that\r\n\"rabble\" that I was by no means such a spiritless creature as I seemed\r\nto myself. What is more, even in the acutest paroxysm of this cowardly\r\nfever, I dreamed of getting the upper hand, of dominating them, carrying\r\nthem away, making them like me--if only for my \"elevation of thought and\r\nunmistakable wit.\" They would abandon Zverkov, he would sit on one side,\r\nsilent and ashamed, while I should crush him. Then, perhaps, we would be\r\nreconciled and drink to our everlasting friendship; but what was most\r\nbitter and most humiliating for me was that I knew even then, knew fully\r\nand for certain, that I needed nothing of all this really, that I did\r\nnot really want to crush, to subdue, to attract them, and that I did not\r\ncare a straw really for the result, even if I did achieve it. Oh, how I\r\nprayed for the day to pass quickly! In unutterable anguish I went to the\r\nwindow, opened the movable pane and looked out into the troubled\r\ndarkness of the thickly falling wet snow. At last my wretched little\r\nclock hissed out five. I seized my hat and trying not to look at\r\nApollon, who had been all day expecting his month's wages, but in his\r\nfoolishness was unwilling to be the first to speak about it, I slipt\r\nbetween him and the door and jumping into a high-class sledge, on which\r\nI spent my last half rouble, I drove up in grand style to the Hotel de\r\nParis.\r\n\nIV\r\n\r\nI had been certain the day before that I should be the first to arrive.\r\nBut it was not a question of being the first to arrive. Not only were\r\nthey not there, but I had difficulty in finding our room. The table was\r\nnot laid even. What did it mean? After a good many questions I elicited\r\nfrom the waiters that the dinner had been ordered not for five, but for\r\nsix o'clock. This was confirmed at the buffet too. I felt really ashamed\r\nto go on questioning them. It was only twenty-five minutes past five. If\r\nthey changed the dinner hour they ought at least to have let me\r\nknow--that is what the post is for, and not to have put me in an absurd\r\nposition in my own eyes and ... and even before the waiters. I sat down;\r\nthe servant began laying the table; I felt even more humiliated when he\r\nwas present. Towards six o'clock they brought in candles, though there\r\nwere lamps burning in the room. It had not occurred to the waiter,\r\nhowever, to bring them in at once when I arrived. In the next room two\r\ngloomy, angry-looking persons were eating their dinners in silence at\r\ntwo different tables. There was a great deal of noise, even shouting, in\r\na room further away; one could hear the laughter of a crowd of people,\r\nand nasty little shrieks in French: there were ladies at the dinner. It\r\nwas sickening, in fact. I rarely passed more unpleasant moments, so much\r\nso that when they did arrive all together punctually at six I was\r\noverjoyed to see them, as though they were my deliverers, and even\r\nforgot that it was incumbent upon me to show resentment.\r\n\r\nZverkov walked in at the head of them; evidently he was the leading\r\nspirit. He and all of them were laughing; but, seeing me, Zverkov drew\r\nhimself up a little, walked up to me deliberately with a slight, rather\r\njaunty bend from the waist. He shook hands with me in a friendly, but\r\nnot over-friendly, fashion, with a sort of circumspect courtesy like\r\nthat of a General, as though in giving me his hand he were warding off\r\nsomething. I had imagined, on the contrary, that on coming in he would\r\nat once break into his habitual thin, shrill laugh and fall to making\r\nhis insipid jokes and witticisms. I had been preparing for them ever\r\nsince the previous day, but I had not expected such condescension, such\r\nhigh-official courtesy. So, then, he felt himself ineffably superior to\r\nme in every respect! If he only meant to insult me by that high-official\r\ntone, it would not matter, I thought--I could pay him back for it one\r\nway or another. But what if, in reality, without the least desire to be\r\noffensive, that sheepshead had a notion in earnest that he was superior\r\nto me and could only look at me in a patronizing way? The very\r\nsupposition made me gasp.\r\n\r\n\"I was surprised to hear of your desire to join us,\" he began, lisping\r\nand drawling, which was something new. \"You and I seem to have seen\r\nnothing of one another. You fight shy of us. You shouldn't. We are not\r\nsuch terrible people as you think. Well, anyway, I am glad to renew our\r\nacquaintance.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he turned carelessly to put down his hat on the window.\r\n\r\n\"Have you been waiting long?\" Trudolyubov inquired.\r\n\r\n\"I arrived at five o'clock as you told me yesterday,\" I answered aloud,\r\nwith an irritability that threatened an explosion.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't you let him know that we had changed the hour?\" said Trudolyubov\r\nto Simonov.\r\n\r\n\"No, I didn't. I forgot,\" the latter replied, with no sign of regret,\r\nand without even apologizing to me he went off to order the _hors\r\nd'oeuvres_.\r\n\r\n\"So you've been here a whole hour? Oh, poor fellow!\" Zverkov cried\r\nironically, for to his notions this was bound to be extremely funny.\r\nThat rascal Ferfitchkin followed with his nasty little snigger like a\r\npuppy yapping. My position struck him, too, as exquisitely ludicrous and\r\nembarrassing.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't funny at all!\" I cried to Ferfitchkin, more and more\r\nirritated. \"It wasn't my fault, but other people's. They neglected to\r\nlet me know. It was ... it was ... it was simply absurd.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not only absurd, but something else as well,\" muttered\r\nTrudolyubov, naively taking my part. \"You are not hard enough upon it.\r\nIt was simply rudeness--unintentional, of course. And how could Simonov\r\n... h'm!\"\r\n\r\n\"If a trick like that had been played on me,\" observed Ferfitchkin, \"I\r\nshould....\"\r\n\r\n\"But you should have ordered something for yourself,\" Zverkov\r\ninterrupted, \"or simply asked for dinner without waiting for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will allow that I might have done that without your permission,\" I\r\nrapped out. \"If I waited, it was....\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us sit down, gentlemen,\" cried Simonov, coming in. \"Everything is\r\nready; I can answer for the champagne; it is capitally frozen.... You\r\nsee, I did not know your address, where was I to look for you?\" he\r\nsuddenly turned to me, but again he seemed to avoid looking at me.\r\nEvidently he had something against me. It must have been what happened\r\nyesterday.\r\n\r\nAll sat down; I did the same. It was a round table. Trudolyubov was on\r\nmy left, Simonov on my right. Zverkov was sitting opposite, Ferfitchkin\r\nnext to him, between him and Trudolyubov.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, are you ... in a government office?\" Zverkov went on attending\r\nto me. Seeing that I was embarrassed he seriously thought that he ought\r\nto be friendly to me, and, so to speak, cheer me up.\r\n\r\n\"Does he want me to throw a bottle at his head?\" I thought, in a fury.\r\nIn my novel surroundings I was unnaturally ready to be irritated.\r\n\r\n\"In the N---- office,\" I answered jerkily, with my eyes on my plate.\r\n\r\n\"And ha-ave you a go-od berth? I say, what ma-a-de you leave your\r\noriginal job?\"\r\n\r\n\"What ma-a-de me was that I wanted to leave my original job,\" I drawled\r\nmore than he, hardly able to control myself. Ferfitchkin went off into a\r\nguffaw. Simonov looked at me ironically. Trudolyubov left off eating and\r\nbegan looking at me with curiosity.\r\n\r\nZverkov winced, but he tried not to notice it.\r\n\r\n\"And the remuneration?\"\r\n\r\n\"What remuneration?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean, your sa-a-lary?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why are you cross-examining me?\" However, I told him at once what my\r\nsalary was. I turned horribly red.\r\n\r\n\"It is not very handsome,\" Zverkov observed majestically.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you can't afford to dine at cafes on that,\" Ferfitchkin added\r\ninsolently.\r\n\r\n\"To my thinking it's very poor,\" Trudolyubov observed gravely.\r\n\r\n\"And how thin you have grown! How you have changed!\" added Zverkov, with\r\na shade of venom in his voice, scanning me and my attire with a sort of\r\ninsolent compassion.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, spare his blushes,\" cried Ferfitchkin, sniggering.\r\n\r\n\"My dear sir, allow me to tell you I am not blushing,\" I broke out at\r\nlast; \"do you hear? I am dining here, at this cafe, at my own expense,\r\nnot at other people's--note that, Mr. Ferfitchkin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wha-at? Isn't every one here dining at his own expense? You would seem\r\nto be....\" Ferfitchkin flew out at me, turning as red as a lobster, and\r\nlooking me in the face with fury.\r\n\r\n\"Tha-at,\" I answered, feeling I had gone too far, \"and I imagine it\r\nwould be better to talk of something more intelligent.\"\r\n\r\n\"You intend to show off your intelligence, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't disturb yourself, that would be quite out of place here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why are you clacking away like that, my good sir, eh? Have you gone out\r\nof your wits in your office?\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough, gentlemen, enough!\" Zverkov cried, authoritatively.\r\n\r\n\"How stupid it is!\" muttered Simonov.\r\n\r\n\"It really is stupid. We have met here, a company of friends, for a\r\nfarewell dinner to a comrade and you carry on an altercation,\" said\r\nTrudolyubov, rudely addressing himself to me alone. \"You invited\r\nyourself to join us, so don't disturb the general harmony.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough, enough!\" cried Zverkov. \"Give over, gentlemen, it's out of\r\nplace. Better let me tell you how I nearly got married the day before\r\nyesterday....\"\r\n\r\nAnd then followed a burlesque narrative of how this gentleman had almost\r\nbeen married two days before. There was not a word about the marriage,\r\nhowever, but the story was adorned with generals, colonels and\r\nkammer-junkers, while Zverkov almost took the lead among them. It was\r\ngreeted with approving laughter; Ferfitchkin positively squealed.\r\n\r\nNo one paid any attention to me, and I sat crushed and humiliated.\r\n\r\n\"Good Heavens, these are not the people for me!\" I thought. \"And what a\r\nfool I have made of myself before them! I let Ferfitchkin go too far,\r\nthough. The brutes imagine they are doing me an honour in letting me sit\r\ndown with them. They don't understand that it's an honour to them and\r\nnot to me! I've grown thinner! My clothes! Oh, damn my trousers! Zverkov\r\nnoticed the yellow stain on the knee as soon as he came in.... But\r\nwhat's the use! I must get up at once, this very minute, take my hat and\r\nsimply go without a word ... with contempt! And to-morrow I can send a\r\nchallenge. The scoundrels! As though I cared about the seven roubles.\r\nThey may think.... Damn it! I don't care about the seven roubles. I'll\r\ngo this minute!\"\r\n\r\nOf course I remained. I drank sherry and Lafitte by the glassful in my\r\ndiscomfiture. Being unaccustomed to it, I was quickly affected. My\r\nannoyance increased as the wine went to my head. I longed all at once to\r\ninsult them all in a most flagrant manner and then go away. To seize the\r\nmoment and show what I could do, so that they would say, \"He's clever,\r\nthough he is absurd,\" and ... and ... in fact, damn them all!\r\n\r\nI scanned them all insolently with my drowsy eyes. But they seemed to\r\nhave forgotten me altogether. They were noisy, vociferous, cheerful.\r\nZverkov was talking all the time. I began listening. Zverkov was talking\r\nof some exuberant lady whom he had at last led on to declaring her love\r\n(of course, he was lying like a horse), and how he had been helped in\r\nthis affair by an intimate friend of his, a Prince Kolya, an officer in\r\nthe hussars, who had three thousand serfs.\r\n\r\n\"And yet this Kolya, who has three thousand serfs, has not put in an\r\nappearance here to-night to see you off,\" I cut in suddenly.\r\n\r\nFor a minute every one was silent. \"You are drunk already.\" Trudolyubov\r\ndeigned to notice me at last, glancing contemptuously in my direction.\r\nZverkov, without a word, examined me as though I were an insect. I\r\ndropped my eyes. Simonov made haste to fill up the glasses with\r\nchampagne.\r\n\r\nTrudolyubov raised his glass, as did every one else but me.\r\n\r\n\"Your health and good luck on the journey!\" he cried to Zverkov. \"To old\r\ntimes, to our future, hurrah!\"\r\n\r\nThey all tossed off their glasses, and crowded round Zverkov to kiss\r\nhim. I did not move; my full glass stood untouched before me.\r\n\r\n\"Why, aren't you going to drink it?\" roared Trudolyubov, losing patience\r\nand turning menacingly to me.\r\n\r\n\"I want to make a speech separately, on my own account ... and then I'll\r\ndrink it, Mr. Trudolyubov.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spiteful brute!\" muttered Simonov. I drew myself up in my chair and\r\nfeverishly seized my glass, prepared for something extraordinary, though\r\nI did not know myself precisely what I was going to say.\r\n\r\n\"_Silence!_\" cried Ferfitchkin. \"Now for a display of wit!\"\r\n\r\nZverkov waited very gravely, knowing what was coming.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Lieutenant Zverkov,\" I began, \"let me tell you that I hate phrases,\r\nphrasemongers and men in corsets ... that's the first point, and there\r\nis a second one to follow it.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a general stir.\r\n\r\n\"The second point is: I hate ribaldry and ribald talkers. Especially\r\nribald talkers! The third point: I love justice, truth and honesty.\" I\r\nwent on almost mechanically, for I was beginning to shiver with horror\r\nmyself and had no idea how I came to be talking like this. \"I love\r\nthought, Monsieur Zverkov; I love true comradeship, on an equal footing\r\nand not.... H'm ... I love.... But, however, why not? I will drink your\r\nhealth, too, Mr. Zverkov. Seduce the Circassian girls, shoot the enemies\r\nof the fatherland and ... and ... to your health, Monsieur Zverkov!\"\r\n\r\nZverkov got up from his seat, bowed to me and said:\r\n\r\n\"I am very much obliged to you.\" He was frightfully offended and turned\r\npale.\r\n\r\n\"Damn the fellow!\" roared Trudolyubov, bringing his fist down on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\"Well, he wants a punch in the face for that,\" squealed Ferfitchkin.\r\n\r\n\"We ought to turn him out,\" muttered Simonov.\r\n\r\n\"Not a word, gentlemen, not a movement!\" cried Zverkov solemnly,\r\nchecking the general indignation. \"I thank you all, but I can show him\r\nfor myself how much value I attach to his words.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Ferfitchkin, you will give me satisfaction to-morrow for your words\r\njust now!\" I said aloud, turning with dignity to Ferfitchkin.\r\n\r\n\"A duel, you mean? Certainly,\" he answered. But probably I was so\r\nridiculous as I challenged him and it was so out of keeping with my\r\nappearance that everyone, including Ferfitchkin, was prostrate with\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, let him alone, of course! He is quite drunk,\" Trudolyubov said\r\nwith disgust.\r\n\r\n\"I shall never forgive myself for letting him join us,\" Simonov muttered\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"Now is the time to throw a bottle at their heads,\" I thought to myself.\r\nI picked up the bottle ... and filled my glass.... \"No, I'd better sit\r\non to the end,\" I went on thinking; \"you would be pleased, my friends if\r\nI went away. Nothing will induce me to go. I'll go on sitting here and\r\ndrinking to the end, on purpose, as a sign that I don't think you of the\r\nslightest consequence. I will go on sitting and drinking, because this\r\nis a public-house and I paid my entrance money. I'll sit here and drink,\r\nfor I look upon you as so many pawns, as inanimate pawns. I'll sit here\r\nand drink ... and sing if I want to, yes, sing, for I have the right to\r\n... to sing.... H'm!\"\r\n\r\nBut I did not sing. I simply tried not to look at any of them. I assumed\r\nmost unconcerned attitudes and waited with impatience for them to speak\r\n_first_. But alas, they did not address me! And oh, how I wished, how I\r\nwished at that moment to be reconciled to them! It struck eight, at last\r\nnine. They moved from the table to the sofa. Zverkov stretched himself\r\non a lounge and put one foot on a round table. Wine was brought there.\r\nHe did, as a fact, order three bottles on his own account. I, of course,\r\nwas not invited to join them. They all sat round him on the sofa. They\r\nlistened to him, almost with reverence. It was evident that they were\r\nfond of him. \"What for? What for?\" I wondered. From time to time they\r\nwere moved to drunken enthusiasm and kissed each other. They talked of\r\nthe Caucasus, of the nature of true passion, of snug berths in the\r\nservice, of the income of an hussar called Podharzhevsky, whom none of\r\nthem knew personally, and rejoiced in the largeness of it, of the\r\nextraordinary grace and beauty of a Princess D., whom none of them had\r\never seen; then it came to Shakespeare's being immortal.\r\n\r\nI smiled contemptuously and walked up and down the other side of the\r\nroom, opposite the sofa, from the table to the stove and back again. I\r\ntried my very utmost to show them that I could do without them, and yet\r\nI purposely made a noise with my boots, thumping with my heels. But it\r\nwas all in vain. They paid no attention. I had the patience to walk up\r\nand down in front of them from eight o'clock till eleven, in the same\r\nplace, from the table to the stove and back again. \"I walk up and down\r\nto please myself and no one can prevent me.\" The waiter who came into\r\nthe room stopped, from time to time, to look at me. I was somewhat giddy\r\nfrom turning round so often; at moments it seemed to me that I was in\r\ndelirium. During those three hours I was three times soaked with sweat\r\nand dry again. At times, with an intense, acute pang I was stabbed to\r\nthe heart by the thought that ten years, twenty years, forty years would\r\npass, and that even in forty years I would remember with loathing and\r\nhumiliation those filthiest, most ludicrous, and most awful moments of\r\nmy life. No one could have gone out of his way to degrade himself more\r\nshamelessly, and I fully realized it, fully, and yet I went on pacing up\r\nand down from the table to the stove. \"Oh, if you only knew what\r\nthoughts and feelings I am capable of, how cultured I am!\" I thought at\r\nmoments, mentally addressing the sofa on which my enemies were sitting.\r\nBut my enemies behaved as though I were not in the room. Once--only\r\nonce--they turned towards me, just when Zverkov was talking about\r\nShakespeare, and I suddenly gave a contemptuous laugh. I laughed in such\r\nan affected and disgusting way that they all at once broke off their\r\nconversation, and silently and gravely for two minutes watched me\r\nwalking up and down from the table to the stove, _taking no notice of\r\nthem_. But nothing came of it: they said nothing, and two minutes later\r\nthey ceased to notice me again. It struck eleven.\r\n\r\n\"Friends,\" cried Zverkov getting up from the sofa, \"let us all be off\r\nnow, _there_!\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, of course,\" the others assented. I turned sharply to\r\nZverkov. I was so harassed, so exhausted, that I would have cut my\r\nthroat to put an end to it. I was in a fever; my hair, soaked with\r\nperspiration, stuck to my forehead and temples.\r\n\r\n\"Zverkov, I beg your pardon,\" I said abruptly and resolutely.\r\n\"Ferfitchkin, yours too, and every one's, every one's: I have insulted\r\nyou all!\"\r\n\r\n\"Aha! A duel is not in your line, old man,\" Ferfitchkin hissed\r\nvenomously.\r\n\r\nIt sent a sharp pang to my heart.\r\n\r\n\"No, it's not the duel I am afraid of, Ferfitchkin! I am ready to fight\r\nyou to-morrow, after we are reconciled. I insist upon it, in fact, and\r\nyou cannot refuse. I want to show you that I am not afraid of a duel.\r\nYou shall fire first and I shall fire into the air.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is comforting himself,\" said Simonov.\r\n\r\n\"He's simply raving,\" said Trudolyubov.\r\n\r\n\"But let us pass. Why are you barring our way? What do you want?\"\r\nZverkov answered disdainfully.\r\n\r\nThey were all flushed; their eyes were bright: they had been drinking\r\nheavily.\r\n\r\n\"I ask for your friendship, Zverkov; I insulted you, but....\"\r\n\r\n\"Insulted? _You_ insulted _me_? Understand, sir, that you never, under\r\nany circumstances, could possibly insult _me_.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that's enough for you. Out of the way!\" concluded Trudolyubov.\r\n\r\n\"Olympia is mine, friends, that's agreed!\" cried Zverkov.\r\n\r\n\"We won't dispute your right, we won't dispute your right,\" the others\r\nanswered, laughing.\r\n\r\nI stood as though spat upon. The party went noisily out of the room.\r\nTrudolyubov struck up some stupid song. Simonov remained behind for a\r\nmoment to tip the waiters. I suddenly went up to him.\r\n\r\n\"Simonov! give me six roubles!\" I said, with desperate resolution.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me in extreme amazement, with vacant eyes. He, too, was\r\ndrunk.\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean you are coming with us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've no money,\" he snapped out, and with a scornful laugh he went out\r\nof the room.\r\n\r\nI clutched at his overcoat. It was a nightmare.\r\n\r\n\"Simonov, I saw you had money. Why do you refuse me? Am I a scoundrel?\r\nBeware of refusing me: if you knew, if you knew why I am asking! My\r\nwhole future, my whole plans depend upon it!\"\r\n\r\nSimonov pulled out the money and almost flung it at me.\r\n\r\n\"Take it, if you have no sense of shame!\" he pronounced pitilessly, and\r\nran to overtake them.\r\n\r\nI was left for a moment alone. Disorder, the remains of dinner, a broken\r\nwine-glass on the floor, spilt wine, cigarette ends, fumes of drink and\r\ndelirium in my brain, an agonizing misery in my heart and finally the\r\nwaiter, who had seen and heard all and was looking inquisitively into my\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"I am going there!\" I cried. \"Either they shall all go down on their\r\nknees to beg for my friendship, or I will give Zverkov a slap in the\r\nface!\"\r\n\nV\r\n\r\n\"So this is it, this is it at last--contact with real life,\" I muttered\r\nas I ran headlong downstairs. \"This is very different from the Pope's\r\nleaving Rome and going to Brazil, very different from the ball on Lake\r\nComo!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a scoundrel,\" a thought flashed through my mind, \"if you laugh\r\nat this now.\"\r\n\r\n\"No matter!\" I cried, answering myself. \"Now everything is lost!\"\r\n\r\nThere was no trace to be seen of them, but that made no difference--I\r\nknew where they had gone.\r\n\r\nAt the steps was standing a solitary night sledge-driver in a rough\r\npeasant coat, powdered over with the still falling, wet, and as it were\r\nwarm, snow. It was hot and steamy. The little shaggy piebald horse was\r\nalso covered with snow and coughing, I remember that very well. I made a\r\nrush for the roughly made sledge; but as soon as I raised my foot to get\r\ninto it, the recollection of how Simonov had just given me six roubles\r\nseemed to double me up and I tumbled into the sledge like a sack.\r\n\r\n\"No, I must do a great deal to make up for all that,\" I cried. \"But I\r\nwill make up for it or perish on the spot this very night. Start!\"\r\n\r\nWe set off. There was a perfect whirl in my head.\r\n\r\n\"They won't go down on their knees to beg for my friendship. That is a\r\nmirage, cheap mirage, revolting, romantic and fantastical--that's\r\nanother ball on Lake Como. And so I am bound to slap Zverkov's face! It\r\nis my duty to. And so it is settled; I am flying to give him a slap in\r\nthe face. Hurry up!\"\r\n\r\nThe driver tugged at the reins.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as I go in I'll give it him. Ought I before giving him the slap\r\nto say a few words by way of preface? No. I'll simply go in and give it\r\nhim. They will all be sitting in the drawing-room, and he with Olympia\r\non the sofa. That damned Olympia! She laughed at my looks on one\r\noccasion and refused me. I'll pull Olympia's hair, pull Zverkov's ears!\r\nNo, better one ear, and pull him by it round the room. Maybe they will\r\nall begin beating me and will kick me out. That's most likely, indeed.\r\nNo matter! Anyway, I shall first slap him; the initiative will be mine;\r\nand by the laws of honour that is everything: he will be branded and\r\ncannot wipe off the slap by any blows, by nothing but a duel. He will be\r\nforced to fight. And let them beat me now. Let them, the ungrateful\r\nwretches! Trudolyubov will beat me hardest, he is so strong; Ferfitchkin\r\nwill be sure to catch hold sideways and tug at my hair. But no matter,\r\nno matter! That's what I am going for. The blockheads will be forced at\r\nlast to see the tragedy of it all! When they drag me to the door I shall\r\ncall out to them that in reality they are not worth my little finger.\r\nGet on, driver, get on!\" I cried to the driver. He started and flicked\r\nhis whip, I shouted so savagely.\r\n\r\n\"We shall fight at daybreak, that's a settled thing. I've done with the\r\noffice. Ferfitchkin made a joke about it just now. But where can I get\r\npistols? Nonsense! I'll get my salary in advance and buy them. And\r\npowder, and bullets? That's the second's business. And how can it all be\r\ndone by daybreak? And where am I to get a second? I have no friends.\r\nNonsense!\" I cried, lashing myself up more and more. \"It's of no\r\nconsequence! the first person I meet in the street is bound to be my\r\nsecond, just as he would be bound to pull a drowning man out of water.\r\nThe most eccentric things may happen. Even if I were to ask the director\r\nhimself to be my second to-morrow, he would be bound to consent, if only\r\nfrom a feeling of chivalry, and to keep the secret! Anton Antonitch....\"\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that at that very minute the disgusting absurdity of my\r\nplan and the other side of the question was clearer and more vivid to my\r\nimagination than it could be to any one on earth. But....\r\n\r\n\"Get on, driver, get on, you rascal, get on!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ugh, sir!\" said the son of toil.\r\n\r\nCold shivers suddenly ran down me. Wouldn't it be better ... to go\r\nstraight home? My God, my God! Why did I invite myself to this dinner\r\nyesterday? But no, it's impossible. And my walking up and down for three\r\nhours from the table to the stove? No, they, they and no one else must\r\npay for my walking up and down! They must wipe out this dishonour! Drive\r\non!\r\n\r\nAnd what if they give me into custody? They won't dare! They'll be\r\nafraid of the scandal. And what if Zverkov is so contemptuous that he\r\nrefuses to fight a duel? He is sure to; but in that case I'll show them\r\n... I will turn up at the posting station when he is setting off\r\nto-morrow, I'll catch him by the leg, I'll pull off his coat when he\r\ngets into the carriage. I'll get my teeth into his hand, I'll bite him.\r\n\"See what lengths you can drive a desperate man to!\" He may hit me on\r\nthe head and they may belabour me from behind. I will shout to the\r\nassembled multitude: \"Look at this young puppy who is driving off to\r\ncaptivate the Circassian girls after letting me spit in his face!\"\r\n\r\nOf course, after that everything will be over! The office will have\r\nvanished off the face of the earth. I shall be arrested, I shall be\r\ntried, I shall be dismissed from the service, thrown in prison, sent to\r\nSiberia. Never mind! In fifteen years when they let me out of prison I\r\nwill trudge off to him, a beggar, in rags. I shall find him in some\r\nprovincial town. He will be married and happy. He will have a grown-up\r\ndaughter.... I shall say to him: \"Look, monster, at my hollow cheeks and\r\nmy rags! I've lost everything--my career, my happiness, art, science,\r\n_the woman I loved_, and all through you. Here are pistols. I have come\r\nto discharge my pistol and ... and I ... forgive you. Then I shall fire\r\ninto the air and he will hear nothing more of me....\"\r\n\r\nI was actually on the point of tears, though I knew perfectly well at\r\nthat moment that all this was out of Pushkin's _Silvio_ and Lermontov's\r\n_Masquerade_. And all at once I felt horribly ashamed, so ashamed that I\r\nstopped the horse, got out of the sledge, and stood still in the snow in\r\nthe middle of the street. The driver gazed at me, sighing and\r\nastonished.\r\n\r\nWhat was I to do? I could not go on there--it was evidently stupid, and\r\nI could not leave things as they were, because that would seem as\r\nthough.... Heavens, how could I leave things! And after such insults!\r\n\"No!\" I cried, throwing myself into the sledge again. \"It is ordained!\r\nIt is fate! Drive on, drive on!\"\r\n\r\nAnd in my impatience I punched the sledge-driver on the back of the\r\nneck.\r\n\r\n\"What are you up to? What are you hitting me for?\" the peasant shouted,\r\nbut he whipped up his nag so that it began kicking.\r\n\r\nThe wet snow was falling in big flakes; I unbuttoned myself, regardless\r\nof it. I forgot everything else, for I had finally decided on the slap,\r\nand felt with horror that it was going to happen _now, at once_, and\r\nthat _no force could stop it_. The deserted street lamps gleamed\r\nsullenly in the snowy darkness like torches at a funeral. The snow\r\ndrifted under my great-coat, under my coat, under my cravat, and melted\r\nthere. I did not wrap myself up--all was lost, anyway.\r\n\r\nAt last we arrived. I jumped out, almost unconscious, ran up the steps\r\nand began knocking and kicking at the door. I felt fearfully weak,\r\nparticularly in my legs and my knees. The door was opened quickly as\r\nthough they knew I was coming. As a fact, Simonov had warned them that\r\nperhaps another gentleman would arrive, and this was a place in which\r\none had to give notice and to observe certain precautions. It was one of\r\nthose \"millinery establishments\" which were abolished by the police a\r\ngood time ago. By day it really was a shop; but at night, if one had an\r\nintroduction, one might visit it for other purposes.\r\n\r\nI walked rapidly through the dark shop into the familiar drawing-room,\r\nwhere there was only one candle burning, and stood still in amazement:\r\nthere was no one there. \"Where are they?\" I asked somebody. But by now,\r\nof course, they had separated. Before me was standing a person with a\r\nstupid smile, the \"madam\" herself, who had seen me before. A minute\r\nlater a door opened and another person came in.\r\n\r\nTaking no notice of anything I strode about the room, and, I believe, I\r\ntalked to myself. I felt as though I had been saved from death and was\r\nconscious of this, joyfully, all over: I should have given that slap, I\r\nshould certainly, certainly have given it! But now they were not here\r\nand ... everything had vanished and changed! I looked round. I could not\r\nrealize my condition yet. I looked mechanically at the girl who had come\r\nin: and had a glimpse of a fresh, young, rather pale face, with\r\nstraight, dark eyebrows, and with grave, as it were wondering, eyes that\r\nattracted me at once; I should have hated her if she had been smiling. I\r\nbegan looking at her more intently and, as it were, with effort. I had\r\nnot fully collected my thoughts. There was something simple and\r\ngood-natured in her face, but something strangely grave. I am sure that\r\nthis stood in her way here, and no one of those fools had noticed her.\r\nShe could not, however, have been called a beauty, though she was tall,\r\nstrong-looking, and well built. She was very simply dressed. Something\r\nloathsome stirred within me. I went straight up to her.\r\n\r\nI chanced to look into the glass. My harassed face struck me as\r\nrevolting in the extreme, pale, angry, abject, with dishevelled hair.\r\n\"No matter, I am glad of it,\" I thought; \"I am glad that I shall seem\r\nrepulsive to her; I like that.\"\r\n\nVI\r\n\r\n... Somewhere behind a screen a clock began wheezing, as though\r\noppressed by something, as though some one were strangling it. After an\r\nunnaturally prolonged wheezing there followed a shrill, nasty, and as it\r\nwere unexpectedly rapid, chime--as though some one were suddenly jumping\r\nforward. It struck two. I woke up, though I had indeed not been asleep\r\nbut lying half conscious.\r\n\r\nIt was almost completely dark in the narrow, cramped, low-pitched room,\r\ncumbered up with an enormous wardrobe and piles of cardboard boxes and\r\nall sorts of frippery and litter. The candle end that had been burning\r\non the table was going out and gave a faint flicker from time to time.\r\nIn a few minutes there would be complete darkness.\r\n\r\nI was not long in coming to myself; everything came back to my mind at\r\nonce, without an effort, as though it had been in ambush to pounce upon\r\nme again. And, indeed, even while I was unconscious a point seemed\r\ncontinually to remain in my memory unforgotten, and round it my dreams\r\nmoved drearily. But strange to say, everything that had happened to me\r\nin that day seemed to me now, on waking, to be in the far, far away\r\npast, as though I had long, long ago lived all that down.\r\n\r\nMy head was full of fumes. Something seemed to be hovering over me,\r\nrousing me, exciting me, and making me restless. Misery and spite seemed\r\nsurging up in me again and seeking an outlet. Suddenly I saw beside me\r\ntwo wide open eyes scrutinizing me curiously and persistently. The look\r\nin those eyes was coldly detached, sullen, as it were utterly remote; it\r\nweighed upon me.\r\n\r\nA grim idea came into my brain and passed all over my body, as a\r\nhorrible sensation, such as one feels when one goes into a damp and\r\nmouldy cellar. There was something unnatural in those two eyes,\r\nbeginning to look at me only now. I recalled, too, that during those two\r\nhours I had not said a single word to this creature, and had, in fact,\r\nconsidered it utterly superfluous; in fact, the silence had for some\r\nreason gratified me. Now I suddenly realized vividly the hideous\r\nidea--revolting as a spider--of vice, which, without love, grossly and\r\nshamelessly begins with that in which true love finds its consummation.\r\nFor a long time we gazed at each other like that, but she did not drop\r\nher eyes before mine and her expression did not change, so that at last\r\nI felt uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n\"What is your name?\" I asked abruptly, to put an end to it.\r\n\r\n\"Liza,\" she answered almost in a whisper, but somehow far from\r\ngraciously, and she turned her eyes away.\r\n\r\nI was silent.\r\n\r\n\"What weather! The snow ... it's disgusting!\" I said, almost to myself,\r\nputting my arm under my head despondently, and gazing at the ceiling.\r\n\r\nShe made no answer. This was horrible.\r\n\r\n\"Have you always lived in Petersburg?\" I asked a minute later, almost\r\nangrily, turning my head slightly towards her.\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where do you come from?\"\r\n\r\n\"From Riga,\" she answered reluctantly.\r\n\r\n\"Are you a German?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Russian.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you been here long?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"In this house?\"\r\n\r\n\"A fortnight.\"\r\n\r\nShe spoke more and more jerkily. The candle went out; I could no longer\r\ndistinguish her face.\r\n\r\n\"Have you a father and mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes ... no ... I have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"There ... in Riga.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing? Why, what class are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tradespeople.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you always lived with them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"How old are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Twenty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you leave them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, for no reason.\"\r\n\r\nThat answer meant \"Let me alone; I feel sick, sad.\"\r\n\r\nWe were silent.\r\n\r\nGod knows why I did not go away. I felt myself more and more sick and\r\ndreary. The images of the previous day began of themselves, apart from\r\nmy will, flitting through my memory in confusion. I suddenly recalled\r\nsomething I had seen that morning when, full of anxious thoughts, I was\r\nhurrying to the office.\r\n\r\n\"I saw them carrying a coffin out yesterday and they nearly dropped it,\"\r\nI suddenly said aloud, not that I desired to open the conversation, but\r\nas it were by accident.\r\n\r\n\"A coffin?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, in the Haymarket; they were bringing it up out of a cellar.\"\r\n\r\n\"From a cellar?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not from a cellar, but from a basement. Oh, you know ... down below ...\r\nfrom a house of ill-fame. It was filthy all round.... Egg-shells, litter\r\n... a stench. It was loathsome.\"\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\n\"A nasty day to be buried,\" I began, simply to avoid being silent.\r\n\r\n\"Nasty, in what way?\"\r\n\r\n\"The snow, the wet.\" (I yawned.)\r\n\r\n\"It makes no difference,\" she said suddenly, after a brief silence.\r\n\r\n\"No, it's horrid.\" (I yawned again.) \"The gravediggers must have sworn\r\nat getting drenched by the snow. And there must have been water in the\r\ngrave.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why water in the grave?\" she asked, with a sort of curiosity, but\r\nspeaking even more harshly and abruptly than before.\r\n\r\nI suddenly began to feel provoked.\r\n\r\n\"Why, there must have been water at the bottom a foot deep. You can't\r\ndig a dry grave in Volkovo Cemetery.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? Why, the place is waterlogged. It's a regular marsh. So they bury\r\nthem in water. I've seen it myself ... many times.\"\r\n\r\n(I had never seen it once, indeed I had never been in Volkovo, and had\r\nonly heard stories of it.)\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to say, you don't mind how you die?\"\r\n\r\n\"But why should I die?\" she answered, as though defending herself.\r\n\r\n\"Why, some day you will die, and you will die just the same as that dead\r\nwoman. She was ... a girl like you. She died of consumption.\"\r\n\r\n\"A wench would have died in hospital....\" (She knows all about it\r\nalready: she said \"wench,\" not \"girl.\")\r\n\r\n\"She was in debt to her madam,\" I retorted, more and more provoked by\r\nthe discussion; \"and went on earning money for her up to the end, though\r\nshe was in consumption. Some sledge-drivers standing by were talking\r\nabout her to some soldiers and telling them so. No doubt they knew her.\r\nThey were laughing. They were going to meet in a pot-house to drink to\r\nher memory.\"\r\n\r\nA great deal of this was my invention. Silence followed, profound\r\nsilence. She did not stir.\r\n\r\n\"And is it better to die in a hospital?\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it just the same? Besides, why should I die?\" she added\r\nirritably.\r\n\r\n\"If not now, a little later.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why a little later?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, indeed? Now you are young, pretty, fresh, you fetch a high price.\r\nBut after another year of this life you will be very different--you will\r\ngo off.\"\r\n\r\n\"In a year?\"\r\n\r\n\"Anyway, in a year you will be worth less,\" I continued malignantly.\r\n\"You will go from here to something lower, another house; a year\r\nlater--to a third, lower and lower, and in seven years you will come to\r\na basement in the Haymarket. That will be if you were lucky. But it\r\nwould be much worse if you got some disease, consumption, say ... and\r\ncaught a chill, or something or other. It's not easy to get over an\r\nillness in your way of life. If you catch anything you may not get rid\r\nof it. And so you would die.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, then I shall die,\" she answered, quite vindictively, and she\r\nmade a quick movement.\r\n\r\n\"But one is sorry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sorry for whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sorry for life.\"\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\n\"Have you been engaged to be married? Eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I am not cross-examining you. It's nothing to me. Why are you so\r\ncross? Of course you may have had your own troubles. What is it to me?\r\nIt's simply that I felt sorry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sorry for whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sorry for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No need,\" she whispered hardly audibly, and again made a faint\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nThat incensed me at once. What! I was so gentle with her, and she....\r\n\r\n\"Why, do you think that you are on the right path?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what's wrong, that you don't think. Realize it while there is\r\nstill time. There still is time. You are still young, good-looking; you\r\nmight love, be married, be happy....\"\r\n\r\n\"Not all married women are happy,\" she snapped out in the rude abrupt\r\ntone she had used at first.\r\n\r\n\"Not all, of course, but anyway it is much better than the life here.\r\nInfinitely better. Besides, with love one can live even without\r\nhappiness. Even in sorrow life is sweet; life is sweet, however one\r\nlives. But here what is there but ... foulness. Phew!\"\r\n\r\nI turned away with disgust; I was no longer reasoning coldly. I began to\r\nfeel myself what I was saying and warmed to the subject. I was already\r\nlonging to expound the cherished ideas I had brooded over in my corner.\r\nSomething suddenly flared up in me. An object had appeared before me.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind my being here, I am not an example for you. I am, perhaps,\r\nworse than you are. I was drunk when I came here, though,\" I hastened,\r\nhowever, to say in self-defence. \"Besides, a man is no example for a\r\nwoman. It's a different thing. I may degrade and defile myself, but I am\r\nnot any one's slave. I come and go, and that's an end of it. I shake it\r\noff, and I am a different man. But you are a slave from the start. Yes,\r\na slave! You give up everything, your whole freedom. If you want to\r\nbreak your chains afterwards, you won't be able to: you will be more and\r\nmore fast in the snares. It is an accursed bondage. I know it. I won't\r\nspeak of anything else, maybe you won't understand, but tell me: no\r\ndoubt you are in debt to your madam? There, you see,\" I added, though\r\nshe made no answer, but only listened in silence, entirely absorbed,\r\n\"that's a bondage for you! You will never buy your freedom. They will\r\nsee to that. It's like selling your soul to the devil.... And besides\r\n... perhaps I, too, am just as unlucky--how do you know--and wallow in\r\nthe mud on purpose, out of misery? You know, men take to drink from\r\ngrief; well, maybe I am here from grief. Come, tell me, what is there\r\ngood here? Here you and I ... came together ... just now and did not say\r\none word to one another all the time, and it was only afterwards you\r\nbegan staring at me like a wild creature, and I at you. Is that loving?\r\nIs that how one human being should meet another? It's hideous, that's\r\nwhat it is!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" she assented sharply and hurriedly.\r\n\r\nI was positively astounded by the promptitude of this \"Yes.\" So the same\r\nthought may have been straying through her mind when she was staring at\r\nme just before. So she, too, was capable of certain thoughts? \"Damn it\r\nall, this was interesting, this was a point of likeness!\" I thought,\r\nalmost rubbing my hands. And indeed it's easy to turn a young soul like\r\nthat!\r\n\r\nIt was the exercise of my power that attracted me most.\r\n\r\nShe turned her head nearer to me, and it seemed to me in the darkness\r\nthat she propped herself on her arm. Perhaps she was scrutinizing me.\r\nHow I regretted that I could not see her eyes. I heard her deep\r\nbreathing.\r\n\r\n\"Why have you come here?\" I asked her, with a note of authority already\r\nin my voice.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how nice it would be to be living in your father's house! It's warm\r\nand free; you have a home of your own.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what if it's worse than this?\"\r\n\r\n\"I must take the right tone,\" flashed through my mind. \"I may not get\r\nfar with sentimentality.\" But it was only a momentary thought. I swear\r\nshe really did interest me. Besides, I was exhausted and moody. And\r\ncunning so easily goes hand-in-hand with feeling.\r\n\r\n\"Who denies it!\" I hastened to answer. \"Anything may happen. I am\r\nconvinced that some one has wronged you, and that you are more sinned\r\nagainst than sinning. Of course, I know nothing of your story, but it's\r\nnot likely a girl like you has come here of her own inclination....\"\r\n\r\n\"A girl like me?\" she whispered, hardly audibly; but I heard it.\r\n\r\nDamn it all, I was flattering her. That was horrid. But perhaps it was a\r\ngood thing.... She was silent.\r\n\r\n\"See, Liza, I will tell you about myself. If I had had a home from\r\nchildhood, I shouldn't be what I am now. I often think that. However bad\r\nit may be at home, anyway they are your father and mother, and not\r\nenemies, strangers. Once a year at least, they'll show their love of\r\nyou. Anyway, you know you are at home. I grew up without a home; and\r\nperhaps that's why I've turned so ... unfeeling.\"\r\n\r\nI waited again. \"Perhaps she doesn't understand,\" I thought, \"and,\r\nindeed, it is absurd--it's moralizing.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I were a father and had a daughter, I believe I should love my\r\ndaughter more than my sons, really,\" I began indirectly, as though\r\ntalking of something else, to distract her attention. I must confess I\r\nblushed.\r\n\r\n\"Why so?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nAh! so she was listening!\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, Liza. I knew a father who was a stern, austere man, but\r\nused to go down on his knees to his daughter, used to kiss her hands,\r\nher feet, he couldn't make enough of her, really. When she danced at\r\nparties he used to stand for five hours at a stretch, gazing at her. He\r\nwas mad over her: I understand that! She would fall asleep tired at\r\nnight, and he would wake to kiss her in her sleep and make the sign of\r\nthe cross over her. He would go about in a dirty old coat, he was stingy\r\nto every one else, but would spend his last penny for her, giving her\r\nexpensive presents, and it was his greatest delight when she was pleased\r\nwith what he gave her. Fathers always love their daughters more than the\r\nmothers do. Some girls live happily at home! And I believe I should\r\nnever let my daughters marry.\"\r\n\r\n\"What next?\" she said, with a faint smile.\r\n\r\n\"I should be jealous, I really should. To think that she should kiss any\r\none else! That she should love a stranger more than her father! It's\r\npainful to imagine it. Of course, that's all nonsense, of course every\r\nfather would be reasonable at last. But I believe before I should let\r\nher marry, I should worry myself to death; I should find fault with all\r\nher suitors. But I should end by letting her marry whom she herself\r\nloved. The one whom the daughter loves always seems the worst to the\r\nfather, you know. That is always so. So many family troubles come from\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some are glad to sell their daughters, rather than marrying them\r\nhonourably.\"\r\n\r\nAh, so that was it!\r\n\r\n\"Such a thing, Liza, happens in those accursed families in which there\r\nis neither love nor God,\" I retorted warmly, \"and where there is no\r\nlove, there is no sense either. There are such families, it's true, but\r\nI am not speaking of them. You must have seen wickedness in your own\r\nfamily, if you talk like that. Truly, you must have been unlucky. H'm!\r\n... that sort of thing mostly comes about through poverty.\"\r\n\r\n\"And is it any better with the gentry? Even among the poor, honest\r\npeople live happily.\"\r\n\r\n\"H'm ... yes. Perhaps. Another thing, Liza, man is fond of reckoning up\r\nhis troubles, but does not count his joys. If he counted them up as he\r\nought, he would see that every lot has enough happiness provided for it.\r\nAnd what if all goes well with the family, if the blessing of God is\r\nupon it, if the husband is a good one, loves you, cherishes you, never\r\nleaves you! There is happiness in such a family! Even sometimes there is\r\nhappiness in the midst of sorrow; and indeed sorrow is everywhere. If\r\nyou marry _you will find out for yourself_. But think of the first years\r\nof married life with one you love: what happiness, what happiness there\r\nsometimes is in it! And indeed it's the ordinary thing. In those early\r\ndays even quarrels with one's husband end happily. Some women get up\r\nquarrels with their husbands just because they love them. Indeed, I knew\r\na woman like that: she seemed to say that because she loved him, she\r\nwould torment him and make him feel it. You know that you may torment a\r\nman on purpose through love. Women are particularly given to that,\r\nthinking to themselves 'I will love him so, I will make so much of him\r\nafterwards, that it's no sin to torment him a little now.' And all in\r\nthe house rejoice in the sight of you, and you are happy and gay and\r\npeaceful and honourable.... Then there are some women who are jealous.\r\nIf he went off anywhere--I knew one such woman, she couldn't restrain\r\nherself, but would jump up at night and run off on the sly to find out\r\nwhere he was, whether he was with some other woman. That's a pity. And\r\nthe woman knows herself it's wrong, and her heart fails her and she\r\nsuffers, but she loves--it's all through love. And how sweet it is to\r\nmake it up after quarrels, to own herself in the wrong or to forgive\r\nhim! And they are both so happy all at once--as though they had met\r\nanew, been married over again; as though their love had begun afresh.\r\nAnd no one, no one should know what passes between husband and wife if\r\nthey love one another. And whatever quarrels there may be between them\r\nthey ought not to call in their own mother to judge between them and\r\ntell tales of one another. They are their own judges. Love is a holy\r\nmystery and ought to be hidden from all other eyes, whatever happens.\r\nThat makes it holier and better. They respect one another more, and much\r\nis built on respect. And if once there has been love, if they have been\r\nmarried for love, why should love pass away? Surely one can keep it! It\r\nis rare that one cannot keep it. And if the husband is kind and\r\nstraightforward, why should not love last? The first phase of married\r\nlove will pass, it is true, but then there will come a love that is\r\nbetter still. Then there will be the union of souls, they will have\r\neverything in common, there will be no secrets between them. And once\r\nthey have children, the most difficult times will seem to them happy, so\r\nlong as there is love and courage. Even toil will be a joy, you may deny\r\nyourself bread for your children and even that will be a joy. They will\r\nlove you for it afterwards; so you are laying by for your future. As the\r\nchildren grow up you feel that you are an example, a support for them;\r\nthat even after you die your children will always keep your thoughts and\r\nfeelings, because they have received them from you, they will take on\r\nyour semblance and likeness. So you see this is a great duty. How can it\r\nfail to draw the father and mother nearer? People say it's a trial to\r\nhave children. Who says that? It is heavenly happiness! Are you fond of\r\nlittle children, Liza? I am awfully fond of them. You know--a little\r\nrosy baby boy at your bosom, and what husband's heart is not touched,\r\nseeing his wife nursing his child! A plump little rosy baby, sprawling\r\nand snuggling, chubby little hands and feet, clean tiny little nails, so\r\ntiny that it makes one laugh to look at them; eyes that look as if they\r\nunderstand everything. And while it sucks it clutches at your bosom with\r\nits little hand, plays. When its father comes up, the child tears itself\r\naway from the bosom, flings itself back, looks at its father, laughs, as\r\nthough it were fearfully funny and falls to sucking again. Or it will\r\nbite its mother's breast when its little teeth are coming, while it\r\nlooks sideways at her with its little eyes as though to say, 'Look, I am\r\nbiting!' Is not all that happiness when they are the three together,\r\nhusband, wife and child? One can forgive a great deal for the sake of\r\nsuch moments. Yes, Liza, one must first learn to live oneself before one\r\nblames others!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's by pictures, pictures like that one must get at you,\" I thought to\r\nmyself, though I did speak with real feeling, and all at once I flushed\r\ncrimson. \"What if she were suddenly to burst out laughing, what should I\r\ndo then?\" That idea drove me to fury. Towards the end of my speech I\r\nreally was excited, and now my vanity was somehow wounded. The silence\r\ncontinued. I almost nudged her.\r\n\r\n\"Why are you----\" she began and stopped. But I understood: there was a\r\nquiver of something different in her voice, not abrupt, harsh and\r\nunyielding as before, but something soft and shamefaced, so shamefaced\r\nthat I suddenly felt ashamed and guilty.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" I asked, with tender curiosity.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you....\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you ... speak somehow like a book,\" she said, and again there was\r\na note of irony in her voice.\r\n\r\nThat remark sent a pang to my heart. It was not what I was expecting.\r\n\r\nI did not understand that she was hiding her feelings under irony, that\r\nthis is usually the last refuge of modest and chaste-souled people when\r\nthe privacy of their soul is coarsely and intrusively invaded, and that\r\ntheir pride makes them refuse to surrender till the last moment and\r\nshrink from giving expression to their feelings before you. I ought to\r\nhave guessed the truth from the timidity with which she had repeatedly\r\napproached her sarcasm, only bringing herself to utter it at last with\r\nan effort. But I did not guess, and an evil feeling took possession of\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"Wait a bit!\" I thought.\r\n\nVII\r\n\r\n\"Oh, hush, Liza! How can you talk about being like a book, when it makes\r\neven me, an outsider, feel sick? Though I don't look at it as an\r\noutsider, for, indeed, it touches me to the heart.... Is it possible, is\r\nit possible that you do not feel sick at being here yourself? Evidently\r\nhabit does wonders! God knows what habit can do with any one. Can you\r\nseriously think that you will never grow old, that you will always be\r\ngood-looking, and that they will keep you here for ever and ever? I say\r\nnothing of the loathsomeness of the life here.... Though let me tell you\r\nthis about it--about your present life, I mean; here though you are\r\nyoung now, attractive, nice, with soul and feeling, yet you know as soon\r\nas I came to myself just now I felt at once sick at being here with you!\r\nOne can only come here when one is drunk. But if you were anywhere else,\r\nliving as good people live, I should perhaps be more than attracted by\r\nyou, should fall in love with you, should be glad of a look from you,\r\nlet alone a word; I should hang about your door, should go down on my\r\nknees to you, should look upon you as my betrothed and think it an\r\nhonour to be allowed to. I should not dare to have an impure thought\r\nabout you. But here, you see, I know that I have only to whistle and you\r\nhave to come with me whether you like it or not. I don't consult your\r\nwishes, but you mine. The lowest labourer hires himself as a workman but\r\nhe doesn't make a slave of himself altogether; besides, he knows that he\r\nwill be free again presently. But when are you free? Only think what you\r\nare giving up here? What is it you are making a slave of? It is your\r\nsoul, together with your body; you are selling your soul which you have\r\nno right to dispose of! You give your love to be outraged by every\r\ndrunkard! Love! But that's everything, you know, it's a priceless\r\ndiamond, it's a maiden's treasure, love--why, a man would be ready to\r\ngive his soul, to face death to gain that love. But how much is your\r\nlove worth now? You are sold, all of you, body and soul, and there is no\r\nneed to strive for love when you can have everything without love. And\r\nyou know there is no greater insult to a girl than that, do you\r\nunderstand? To be sure, I have heard that they comfort you, poor fools,\r\nthey let you have lovers of your own here. But you know that's simply a\r\nfarce, that's simply a sham, it's just laughing at you, and you are\r\ntaken in by it! Why, do you suppose he really loves you, that lover of\r\nyours? I don't believe it. How can he love you when he knows you may be\r\ncalled away from him any minute? He would be a low fellow if he did!\r\nWill he have a grain of respect for you? What have you in common with\r\nhim? He laughs at you and robs you--that is all his love amounts to! You\r\nare lucky if he does not beat you. Very likely he does beat you, too.\r\nAsk him, if you have got one, whether he will marry you. He will laugh\r\nin your face, if he doesn't spit in it or give you a blow--though maybe\r\nhe is not worth a bad halfpenny himself. And for what have you ruined\r\nyour life, if you come to think of it? For the coffee they give you to\r\ndrink and the plentiful meals? But with what object are they feeding you\r\nup? An honest girl couldn't swallow the food, for she would know what\r\nshe was being fed for. You are in debt here, and, of course, you will\r\nalways be in debt, and you will go on in debt to the end, till the\r\nvisitors here begin to scorn you. And that will soon happen, don't rely\r\nupon your youth--all that flies by express train here, you know. You\r\nwill be kicked out. And not simply kicked out; long before that she'll\r\nbegin nagging at you, scolding you, abusing you, as though you had not\r\nsacrificed your health for her, had not thrown away your youth and your\r\nsoul for her benefit, but as though you had ruined her, beggared her,\r\nrobbed her. And don't expect any one to take your part: the others, your\r\ncompanions, will attack you, too, to win her favour, for all are in\r\nslavery here, and have lost all conscience and pity here long ago. They\r\nhave become utterly vile, and nothing on earth is viler, more loathsome,\r\nand more insulting than their abuse. And you are laying down everything\r\nhere, unconditionally, youth and health and beauty and hope, and at\r\ntwenty-two you will look like a woman of five-and-thirty, and you will\r\nbe lucky if you are not diseased, pray to God for that! No doubt you are\r\nthinking now that you have a gay time and no work to do! Yet there is no\r\nwork harder or more dreadful in the world or ever has been. One would\r\nthink that the heart alone would be worn out with tears. And you won't\r\ndare to say a word, not half a word when they drive you away from here;\r\nyou will go away as though you were to blame. You will change to another\r\nhouse, then to a third, then somewhere else, till you come down at last\r\nto the Haymarket. There you will be beaten at every turn; that is good\r\nmanners there, the visitors don't know how to be friendly without\r\nbeating you. You don't believe that it is so hateful there? Go and look\r\nfor yourself some time, you can see with your own eyes. Once, one New\r\nYear's Day, I saw a woman at a door. They had turned her out as a joke,\r\nto give her a taste of the frost because she had been crying so much,\r\nand they shut the door behind her. At nine o'clock in the morning she\r\nwas already quite drunk, dishevelled, half-naked, covered with bruises,\r\nher face was powdered, but she had a black eye, blood was trickling from\r\nher nose and her teeth; some cabman had just given her a drubbing. She\r\nwas sitting on the stone steps, a salt fish of some sort was in her\r\nhand; she was crying, wailing something about her luck and beating with\r\nthe fish on the steps, and cabmen and drunken soldiers were crowding in\r\nthe doorway taunting her. You don't believe that you will ever be like\r\nthat? I should be sorry to believe it, too, but how do you know; maybe\r\nten years, eight years ago that very woman with the salt fish came here\r\nfresh as a cherub, innocent, pure, knowing no evil, blushing at every\r\nword. Perhaps she was like you, proud, ready to take offence, not like\r\nthe others; perhaps she looked like a queen, and knew what happiness was\r\nin store for the man who should love her and whom she should love. Do\r\nyou see how it ended? And what if at that very minute when she was\r\nbeating on the filthy steps with that fish, drunken and\r\ndishevelled--what if at that very minute she recalled the pure early\r\ndays in her father's house, when she used to go to school and the\r\nneighbour's son watched for her on the way, declaring that he would love\r\nher as long as he lived, that he would devote his life to her, and when\r\nthey vowed to love one another for ever and be married as soon as they\r\nwere grown up! No, Liza, it would be happy for you if you were to die\r\nsoon of consumption in some corner, in some cellar like that woman just\r\nnow. In the hospital, do you say? You will be lucky if they take you,\r\nbut what if you are still of use to the madam here? Consumption is a\r\nqueer disease, it is not like fever. The patient goes on hoping till the\r\nlast minute and says he is all right. He deludes himself. And that just\r\nsuits your madam. Don't doubt it, that's how it is; you have sold your\r\nsoul, and what is more you owe money, so you daren't say a word. But\r\nwhen you are dying, all will abandon you, all will turn away from you,\r\nfor then there will be nothing to get from you. What's more, they will\r\nreproach you for cumbering the place, for being so long over dying.\r\nHowever you beg you won't get a drink of water without abuse: 'Whenever\r\nare you going off, you nasty hussy, you won't let us sleep with your\r\nmoaning, you make the gentlemen sick.' That's true, I have heard such\r\nthings said myself. They will thrust you dying into the filthiest corner\r\nin the cellar--in the damp and darkness; what will your thoughts be,\r\nlying there alone? When you die, strange hands will lay you out, with\r\ngrumbling and impatience; no one will bless you, no one will sigh for\r\nyou, they only want to get rid of you as soon as may be; they will buy a\r\ncoffin, take you to the grave as they did that poor woman to-day, and\r\ncelebrate your memory at the tavern. In the grave sleet, filth, wet\r\nsnow--no need to put themselves out for you--'Let her down, Vanuha; it's\r\njust like her luck--even here, she is head-foremost, the hussy. Shorten\r\nthe cord, you rascal.' 'It's all right as it is.' 'All right, is it?\r\nWhy, she's on her side! She was a fellow-creature, after all! But, never\r\nmind, throw the earth on her.' And they won't care to waste much time\r\nquarrelling over you. They will scatter the wet blue clay as quick as\r\nthey can and go off to the tavern ... and there your memory on earth\r\nwill end; other women have children to go to their graves, fathers,\r\nhusbands. While for you neither tear, nor sigh, nor remembrance; no one\r\nin the whole world will ever come to you, your name will vanish from the\r\nface of the earth--as though you had never existed, never been born at\r\nall! Nothing but filth and mud, however you knock at your coffin lid at\r\nnight, when the dead arise, however you cry: 'Let me out, kind people,\r\nto live in the light of day! My life was no life at all; my life has\r\nbeen thrown away like a dish-clout; it was drunk away in the tavern at\r\nthe Haymarket; let me out, kind people, to live in the world again.'\"\r\n\r\nAnd I worked myself up to such a pitch that I began to have a lump in my\r\nthroat myself, and ... and all at once I stopped, sat up in dismay, and\r\nbending over apprehensively, began to listen with a beating heart. I had\r\nreason to be troubled.\r\n\r\nI had felt for some time that I was turning her soul upside down and\r\nrending her heart, and--and the more I was convinced of it, the more\r\neagerly I desired to gain my object as quickly and as effectually as\r\npossible. It was the exercise of my skill that carried me away; yet it\r\nwas not merely sport....\r\n\r\nI knew I was speaking stiffly, artificially, even bookishly, in fact, I\r\ncould not speak except \"like a book.\" But that did not trouble me: I\r\nknew, I felt that I should be understood and that this very bookishness\r\nmight be an assistance. But now, having attained my effect, I was\r\nsuddenly panic-stricken. Never before had I witnessed such despair! She\r\nwas lying on her face, thrusting her face into the pillow and clutching\r\nit in both hands. Her heart was being torn. Her youthful body was\r\nshuddering all over as though in convulsions. Suppressed sobs rent her\r\nbosom and suddenly burst out in weeping and wailing, then she pressed\r\ncloser into the pillow: she did not want any one here, not a living\r\nsoul, to know of her anguish and her tears. She bit the pillow, bit her\r\nhand till it bled (I saw that afterwards), or, thrusting her fingers\r\ninto her dishevelled hair seemed rigid with the effort of restraint,\r\nholding her breath and clenching her teeth. I began saying something,\r\nbegging her to calm herself, but felt that I did not dare; and all at\r\nonce, in a sort of cold shiver, almost in terror, began fumbling in the\r\ndark, trying hurriedly to get dressed to go. It was dark: though I tried\r\nmy best I could not finish dressing quickly. Suddenly I felt a box of\r\nmatches and a candlestick with a whole candle in it. As soon as the room\r\nwas lighted up, Liza sprang up, sat up in bed, and with a contorted\r\nface, with a half insane smile, looked at me almost senselessly. I sat\r\ndown beside her and took her hands; she came to herself, made an\r\nimpulsive movement towards me, would have caught hold of me, but did not\r\ndare, and slowly bowed her head before me.\r\n\r\n\"Liza, my dear, I was wrong ... forgive me, my dear,\" I began, but she\r\nsqueezed my hand in her fingers so tightly that I felt I was saying the\r\nwrong thing and stopped.\r\n\r\n\"This is my address, Liza, come to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will come,\" she answered resolutely, her head still bowed.\r\n\r\n\"But now I am going, good-bye ... till we meet again.\"\r\n\r\nI got up; she, too, stood up and suddenly flushed all over, gave a\r\nshudder, snatched up a shawl that was lying on a chair and muffled\r\nherself in it to her chin. As she did this she gave another sickly\r\nsmile, blushed and looked at me strangely. I felt wretched; I was in\r\nhaste to get away--to disappear.\r\n\r\n\"Wait a minute,\" she said suddenly, in the passage just at the doorway,\r\nstopping me with her hand on my overcoat. She put down the candle in hot\r\nhaste and ran off; evidently she had thought of something or wanted to\r\nshow me something. As she ran away she flushed, her eyes shone, and\r\nthere was a smile on her lips--what was the meaning of it? Against my\r\nwill I waited: she came back a minute later with an expression that\r\nseemed to ask forgiveness for something. In fact, it was not the same\r\nface, not the same look as the evening before: sullen, mistrustful and\r\nobstinate. Her eyes now were imploring, soft, and at the same time\r\ntrustful, caressing, timid. The expression with which children look at\r\npeople they are very fond of, of whom they are asking a favour. Her eyes\r\nwere a light hazel, they were lovely eyes, full of life, and capable of\r\nexpressing love as well as sullen hatred.\r\n\r\nMaking no explanation, as though I, as a sort of higher being, must\r\nunderstand everything without explanations, she held out a piece of\r\npaper to me. Her whole face was positively beaming at that instant with\r\nnaive, almost childish, triumph. I unfolded it. It was a letter to her\r\nfrom a medical student or some one of that sort--a very high-flown and\r\nflowery, but extremely respectful, love-letter. I don't recall the words\r\nnow, but I remember well that through the high-flown phrases there was\r\napparent a genuine feeling, which cannot be feigned. When I had finished\r\nreading it I met her glowing, questioning, and childishly impatient eyes\r\nfixed upon me. She fastened her eyes upon my face and waited impatiently\r\nfor what I should say. In a few words, hurriedly, but with a sort of joy\r\nand pride, she explained to me that she had been to a dance somewhere in\r\na private house, a family of \"very nice people, _who knew nothing_,\r\nabsolutely nothing, for she had only come here so lately and it had all\r\nhappened ... and she hadn't made up her mind to stay and was certainly\r\ngoing away as soon as she had paid her debt ... and at that party there\r\nhad been the student who had danced with her all the evening. He had\r\ntalked to her, and it turned out that he had known her in old days at\r\nRiga when he was a child, they had played together, but a very long time\r\nago--and he knew her parents, but _about this_ he knew nothing, nothing\r\nwhatever, and had no suspicion! And the day after the dance (three days\r\nago) he had sent her that letter through the friend with whom she had\r\ngone to the party ... and ... well, that was all.\"\r\n\r\nShe dropped her shining eyes with a sort of bashfulness as she finished.\r\n\r\nThe poor girl was keeping that student's letter as a precious treasure,\r\nand had run to fetch it, her only treasure, because she did not want me\r\nto go away without knowing that she, too, was honestly and genuinely\r\nloved; that she, too, was addressed respectfully. No doubt that letter\r\nwas destined to lie in her box and lead to nothing. But none the less, I\r\nam certain that she would keep it all her life as a precious treasure,\r\nas her pride and justification, and now at such a minute she had thought\r\nof that letter and brought it with naive pride to raise herself in my\r\neyes that I might see, that I, too, might think well of her. I said\r\nnothing, pressed her hand and went out. I so longed to get away.... I\r\nwalked all the way home, in spite of the fact that the melting snow was\r\nstill falling in heavy flakes. I was exhausted, shattered, in\r\nbewilderment. But behind the bewilderment the truth was already\r\ngleaming. The loathsome truth.\r\n\nVIII\r\n\r\nIt was some time, however, before I consented to recognize that truth.\r\nWaking up in the morning after some hours of heavy, leaden sleep, and\r\nimmediately realizing all that had happened on the previous day, I was\r\npositively amazed at my last night's _sentimentality_ with Liza, at all\r\nthose \"outcries of horror and pity.\" \"To think of having such an attack\r\nof womanish hysteria, pah!\" I concluded. And what did I thrust my\r\naddress upon her for? What if she comes? Let her come, though; it\r\ndoesn't matter.... But _obviously_, that was not now the chief and the\r\nmost important matter: I had to make haste and at all costs save my\r\nreputation in the eyes of Zverkov and Simonov as quickly as possible;\r\nthat was the chief business. And I was so taken up that morning that I\r\nactually forgot all about Liza.\r\n\r\nFirst of all I had at once to repay what I had borrowed the day before\r\nfrom Simonov. I resolved on a desperate measure: to borrow fifteen\r\nroubles straight off from Anton Antonitch. As luck would have it he was\r\nin the best of humours that morning, and gave it to me at once, on the\r\nfirst asking. I was so delighted at this that, as I signed the I O U\r\nwith a swaggering air, I told him casually that the night before \"I had\r\nbeen keeping it up with some friends at the Hotel de Paris; we were\r\ngiving a farewell party to a comrade, in fact, I might say a friend of\r\nmy childhood, and you know--a desperate rake, fearfully spoilt--of\r\ncourse, he belongs to a good family, and has considerable means, a\r\nbrilliant career; he is witty, charming, a regular Lovelace, you\r\nunderstand; we drank an extra 'half-dozen' and....\"\r\n\r\nAnd it went off all right; all this was uttered very easily,\r\nunconstrainedly and complacently.\r\n\r\nOn reaching home I promptly wrote to Simonov.\r\n\r\nTo this hour I am lost in admiration when I recall the truly\r\ngentlemanly, good-humoured, candid tone of my letter. With tact and\r\ngood-breeding, and, above all, entirely without superfluous words, I\r\nblamed myself for all that had happened. I defended myself, \"if I really\r\nmay be allowed to defend myself,\" by alleging that being utterly\r\nunaccustomed to wine, I had been intoxicated with the first glass, which\r\nI said, I had drunk before they arrived, while I was waiting for them at\r\nthe Hotel de Paris between five and six o'clock. I begged Simonov's\r\npardon especially; I asked him to convey my explanations to all the\r\nothers, especially to Zverkov, whom \"I seemed to remember as though in a\r\ndream\" I had insulted. I added that I would have called upon all of them\r\nmyself, but my head ached, and besides I had not the face to. I was\r\nparticularly pleased with a certain lightness, almost carelessness\r\n(strictly within the bounds of politeness, however), which was apparent\r\nin my style, and better than any possible arguments, gave them at once\r\nto understand that I took rather an independent view of \"all that\r\nunpleasantness last night;\" that I was by no means so utterly crushed as\r\nyou, my friends, probably imagine; but on the contrary, looked upon it\r\nas a gentleman serenely respecting himself should look upon it. \"On a\r\nyoung hero's past no censure is cast!\"\r\n\r\n\"There is actually an aristocratic playfulness about it!\" I thought\r\nadmiringly, as I read over the letter. And it's all because I am an\r\nintellectual and cultivated man! Another man in my place would not have\r\nknown how to extricate himself, but here I have got out of it and am as\r\njolly as ever again, and all because I am \"a cultivated and educated man\r\nof our day.\" And, indeed, perhaps, everything was due to the wine\r\nyesterday. H'm! ... no, it was not the wine. I did not drink anything at\r\nall between five and six when I was waiting for them. I had lied to\r\nSimonov; I had lied shamelessly; and indeed I wasn't ashamed now....\r\nHang it all though, the great thing was that I was rid of it.\r\n\r\nI put six roubles in the letter, sealed it up, and asked Apollon to take\r\nit to Simonov. When he learned that there was money in the letter,\r\nApollon became more respectful and agreed to take it. Towards evening I\r\nwent out for a walk. My head was still aching and giddy after yesterday.\r\nBut as evening came on and the twilight grew denser, my impressions and,\r\nfollowing them, my thoughts, grew more and more different and confused.\r\nSomething was not dead within me, in the depths of my heart and\r\nconscience it would not die, and it showed itself in acute depression.\r\nFor the most part I jostled my way through the most crowded business\r\nstreets, along Myeshtchansky Street, along Sadovy Street and in Yusupov\r\nGarden. I always liked particularly sauntering along these streets in\r\nthe dusk, just when there were crowds of working people of all sorts\r\ngoing home from their daily work, with faces looking cross with anxiety.\r\nWhat I liked was just that cheap bustle, that bare prose. On this\r\noccasion the jostling of the streets irritated me more than ever. I\r\ncould not make out what was wrong with me, I could not find the clue,\r\nsomething seemed rising up continually in my soul, painfully, and\r\nrefusing to be appeased. I returned home completely upset, it was just\r\nas though some crime were lying on my conscience.\r\n\r\nThe thought that Liza was coming worried me continually. It seemed queer\r\nto me that of all my recollections of yesterday this tormented me, as it\r\nwere, especially, as it were, quite separately. Everything else I had\r\nquite succeeded in forgetting by the evening; I dismissed it all and was\r\nstill perfectly satisfied with my letter to Simonov. But on this point I\r\nwas not satisfied at all. It was as though I were worried only by Liza.\r\n\"What if she comes,\" I thought incessantly, \"well, it doesn't matter,\r\nlet her come! H'm! it's horrid that she should see, for instance, how I\r\nlive. Yesterday I seemed such a hero to her, while now, h'm! It's\r\nhorrid, though, that I have let myself go so, the room looks like a\r\nbeggar's. And I brought myself to go out to dinner in such a suit! And\r\nmy American leather sofa with the stuffing sticking out. And my\r\ndressing-gown, which will not cover me, such tatters, and she will see\r\nall this and she will see Apollon. That beast is certain to insult her.\r\nHe will fasten upon her in order to be rude to me. And I, of course,\r\nshall be panic-stricken as usual, I shall begin bowing and scraping\r\nbefore her and pulling my dressing-gown round me, I shall begin smiling,\r\ntelling lies. Oh, the beastliness! And it isn't the beastliness of it\r\nthat matters most! There is something more important, more loathsome,\r\nviler! Yes, viler! And to put on that dishonest lying mask again!\"...\r\n\r\nWhen I reached that thought I fired up all at once.\r\n\r\n\"Why dishonest? How dishonest? I was speaking sincerely last night. I\r\nremember there was real feeling in me, too. What I wanted was to excite\r\nan honourable feeling in her.... Her crying was a good thing, it will\r\nhave a good effect.\"\r\n\r\nYet I could not feel at ease. All that evening, even when I had come\r\nback home, even after nine o'clock, when I calculated that Liza could\r\nnot possibly come, she still haunted me, and what was worse, she came\r\nback to my mind always in the same position. One moment out of all that\r\nhad happened last night stood vividly before my imagination; the moment\r\nwhen I struck a match and saw her pale, distorted face, with its look of\r\ntorture. And what a pitiful, what an unnatural, what a distorted smile\r\nshe had at that moment! But I did not know then, that fifteen years\r\nlater I should still in my imagination see Liza, always with the\r\npitiful, distorted, inappropriate smile which was on her face at that\r\nminute.\r\n\r\nNext day I was ready again to look upon it all as nonsense, due to\r\nover-excited nerves, and, above all, as _exaggerated_. I was always\r\nconscious of that weak point of mine, and sometimes very much afraid of\r\nit. \"I exaggerate everything, that is where I go wrong,\" I repeated to\r\nmyself every hour. But, however, \"Liza will very likely come all the\r\nsame,\" was the refrain with which all my reflections ended. I was so\r\nuneasy that I sometimes flew into a fury: \"She'll come, she is certain\r\nto come!\" I cried, running about the room, \"if not to-day, she will come\r\nto-morrow; she'll find me out! The damnable romanticism of these pure\r\nhearts! Oh, the vileness--oh, the silliness--oh, the stupidity of these\r\n'wretched sentimental souls!' Why, how fail to understand? How could one\r\nfail to understand?...\"\r\n\r\nBut at this point I stopped short, and in great confusion, indeed.\r\n\r\nAnd how few, how few words, I thought, in passing, were needed; how\r\nlittle of the idyllic (and affectedly, bookishly, artificially idyllic\r\ntoo) had sufficed to turn a whole human life at once according to my\r\nwill. That's virginity, to be sure! Freshness of soil!\r\n\r\nAt times a thought occurred to me, to go to her, \"to tell her all,\" and\r\nbeg her not to come to me. But this thought stirred such wrath in me\r\nthat I believed I should have crushed that \"damned\" Liza if she had\r\nchanced to be near me at the time. I should have insulted her, have spat\r\nat her, have turned her out, have struck her!\r\n\r\nOne day passed, however, another and another; she did not come and I\r\nbegan to grow calmer. I felt particularly bold and cheerful after nine\r\no'clock, I even sometimes began dreaming, and rather sweetly: I, for\r\ninstance, became the salvation of Liza, simply through her coming to me\r\nand my talking to her.... I develop her, educate her. Finally, I notice\r\nthat she loves me, loves me passionately. I pretend not to understand (I\r\ndon't know, however, why I pretend, just for effect, perhaps). At last\r\nall confusion, transfigured, trembling and sobbing, she flings herself\r\nat my feet and says that I am her saviour, and that she loves me better\r\nthan anything in the world. I am amazed, but.... \"Liza,\" I say, \"can you\r\nimagine that I have not noticed your love, I saw it all, I divined it,\r\nbut I did not dare to approach you first, because I had an influence\r\nover you and was afraid that you would force yourself, from gratitude,\r\nto respond to my love, would try to rouse in your heart a feeling which\r\nwas perhaps absent, and I did not wish that ... because it would be\r\ntyranny ... it would be indelicate (in short, I launch off at that point\r\ninto European, inexplicably lofty subtleties a la George Sand), but now,\r\nnow you are mine, you are my creation, you are pure, you are good, you\r\nare my noble wife.\r\n\r\n 'Into my house come bold and free,\r\n Its rightful mistress there to be.'\"\r\n\r\nThen we begin living together, go abroad and so on, and so on. In fact,\r\nin the end it seemed vulgar to me myself, and I began putting out my\r\ntongue at myself.\r\n\r\nBesides, they won't let her out, \"the hussy!\" I thought. They don't let\r\nthem go out very readily, especially in the evening (for some reason I\r\nfancied she would come in the evening, and at seven o'clock precisely).\r\nThough she did say she was not altogether a slave there yet, and had\r\ncertain rights; so, h'm! Damn it all, she will come, she is sure to\r\ncome!\r\n\r\nIt was a good thing, in fact, that Apollon distracted my attention at\r\nthat time by his rudeness. He drove me beyond all patience! He was the\r\nbane of my life, the curse laid upon me by Providence. We had been\r\nsquabbling continually for years, and I hated him. My God, how I hated\r\nhim! I believe I had never hated any one in my life as I hated him,\r\nespecially at some moments. He was an elderly, dignified man, who worked\r\npart of his time as a tailor. But for some unknown reason he despised me\r\nbeyond all measure, and looked down upon me insufferably. Though,\r\nindeed, he looked down upon every one. Simply to glance at that flaxen,\r\nsmoothly brushed head, at the tuft of hair he combed up on his forehead\r\nand oiled with sunflower oil, at that dignified mouth, compressed into\r\nthe shape of the letter V, made one feel one was confronting a man who\r\nnever doubted of himself. He was a pedant, to the most extreme point,\r\nthe greatest pedant I had met on earth, and with that had a vanity only\r\nbefitting Alexander of Macedon. He was in love with every button on his\r\ncoat, every nail on his fingers--absolutely in love with them, and he\r\nlooked it! In his behaviour to me he was a perfect tyrant, he spoke very\r\nlittle to me, and if he chanced to glance at me he gave me a firm,\r\nmajestically self-confident and invariably ironical look that drove me\r\nsometimes to fury. He did his work with the air of doing me the greatest\r\nfavour. Though he did scarcely anything for me, and did not, indeed,\r\nconsider himself bound to do anything. There could be no doubt that he\r\nlooked upon me as the greatest fool on earth, and that \"he did not get\r\nrid of me\" was simply that he could get wages from me every month. He\r\nconsented to do nothing for me for seven roubles a month. Many sins\r\nshould be forgiven me for what I suffered from him. My hatred reached\r\nsuch a point that sometimes his very step almost threw me into\r\nconvulsions. What I loathed particularly was his lisp. His tongue must\r\nhave been a little too long or something of that sort, for he\r\ncontinually lisped, and seemed to be very proud of it, imagining that it\r\ngreatly added to his dignity. He spoke in a slow, measured tone, with\r\nhis hands behind his back and his eyes fixed on the ground. He maddened\r\nme particularly when he read aloud the psalms to himself behind his\r\npartition. Many a battle I waged over that reading! But he was awfully\r\nfond of reading aloud in the evenings, in a slow, even, sing-song voice,\r\nas though over the dead. It is interesting that that is how he has\r\nended: he hires himself out to read the psalms over the dead, and at the\r\nsame time he kills rats and makes blacking. But at that time I could not\r\nget rid of him, it was as though he were chemically combined with my\r\nexistence. Besides, nothing would have induced him to consent to leave\r\nme. I could not live in furnished lodgings: my lodging was my private\r\nsolitude, my shell, my cave, in which I concealed myself from all\r\nmankind, and Apollon seemed to me, for some reason, an integral part of\r\nthat flat, and for seven years I could not turn him away.\r\n\r\nTo be two or three days behind with his wages, for instance, was\r\nimpossible. He would have made such a fuss, I should not have known\r\nwhere to hide my head. But I was so exasperated with every one during\r\nthose days, that I made up my mind for some reason and with some object\r\nto _punish_ Apollon and not to pay him for a fortnight the wages that\r\nwere owing him. I had for a long time--for the last two years--been\r\nintending to do this, simply in order to teach him not to give himself\r\nairs with me, and to show him that if I liked I could withhold his\r\nwages. I purposed to say nothing to him about it, and was purposely\r\nsilent indeed, in order to score off his pride and force him to be the\r\nfirst to speak of his wages. Then I would take the seven roubles out of\r\na drawer, show him I have the money put aside on purpose, but that I\r\nwon't, I won't, I simply won't pay him his wages, I won't just because\r\nthat is \"what I wish,\" because \"I am master, and it is for me to\r\ndecide,\" because he has been disrespectful, because he has been rude;\r\nbut if he were to ask respectfully I might be softened and give it to\r\nhim, otherwise he might wait another fortnight, another three weeks, a\r\nwhole month....\r\n\r\nBut angry as I was, yet he got the better of me. I could not hold out\r\nfor four days. He began as he always did begin in such cases, for there\r\nhad been such cases already, there had been attempts (and it may be\r\nobserved I knew all this beforehand, I knew his nasty tactics by heart).\r\nHe would begin by fixing upon me an exceedingly severe stare, keeping it\r\nup for several minutes at a time, particularly on meeting me or seeing\r\nme out of the house. If I held out and pretended not to notice these\r\nstares, he would, still in silence, proceed to further tortures. All at\r\nonce, _a propos_ of nothing, he would walk softly and smoothly into my\r\nroom, when I was pacing up and down or reading, stand at the door, one\r\nhand behind his back and one foot behind the other, and fix upon me a\r\nstare more than severe, utterly contemptuous. If I suddenly asked him\r\nwhat he wanted, he would make me no answer, but continue staring at me\r\npersistently for some seconds, then, with a peculiar compression of his\r\nlips and a most significant air, deliberately turn round and\r\ndeliberately go back to his room. Two hours later he would come out\r\nagain and again present himself before me in the same way. It had\r\nhappened that in my fury I did not even ask him what he wanted, but\r\nsimply raised my head sharply and imperiously and began staring back at\r\nhim. So we stared at one another for two minutes; at last he turned with\r\ndeliberation and dignity and went back again for two hours.\r\n\r\nIf I were still not brought to reason by all this, but persisted in my\r\nrevolt, he would suddenly begin sighing while he looked at me, long,\r\ndeep sighs as though measuring by them the depths of my moral\r\ndegradation, and, of course, it ended at last by his triumphing\r\ncompletely: I raged and shouted, but still was forced to do what he\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\nThis time the usual staring manoeuvres had scarcely begun when I lost\r\nmy temper and flew at him in a fury. I was irritated beyond endurance\r\napart from him.\r\n\r\n\"Stay,\" I cried, in a frenzy, as he was slowly and silently turning,\r\nwith one hand behind his back, to go to his room, \"stay! Come back, come\r\nback, I tell you!\" and I must have bawled so unnaturally, that he turned\r\nround and even looked at me with some wonder. However, he persisted in\r\nsaying nothing, and that infuriated me.\r\n\r\n\"How dare you come and look at me like that without being sent for?\r\nAnswer!\"\r\n\r\nAfter looking at me calmly for half a minute, he began turning round\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"Stay!\" I roared, running up to him, \"don't stir! There. Answer, now:\r\nwhat did you come in to look at?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you have any order to give me it's my duty to carry it out,\" he\r\nanswered, after another silent pause, with a slow, measured lisp,\r\nraising his eyebrows and calmly twisting his head from one side to\r\nanother, all this with exasperating composure.\r\n\r\n\"That's not what I am asking you about, you torturer!\" I shouted,\r\nturning crimson with anger. \"I'll tell you why you came here myself: you\r\nsee, I don't give you your wages, you are so proud you don't want to bow\r\ndown and ask for it, and so you come to punish me with your stupid\r\nstares, to worry me and you have no sus...pic...ion how stupid it\r\nis--stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid!\"...\r\n\r\nHe would have turned round again without a word, but I seized him.\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" I shouted to him. \"Here's the money, do you see, here it is\"\r\n(I took it out of the table drawer); \"here's the seven roubles complete,\r\nbut you are not going to have it, you ... are ... not ... going ... to\r\n... have it until you come respectfully with bowed head to beg my\r\npardon. Do you hear?\"\r\n\r\n\"That cannot be,\" he answered, with the most unnatural self-confidence.\r\n\r\n\"It shall be so,\" I said, \"I give you my word of honour, it shall be!\"\r\n\r\n\"And there's nothing for me to beg your pardon for,\" he went on, as\r\nthough he had not noticed my exclamations at all. \"Why, besides, you\r\ncalled me a 'torturer,' for which I can summon you at the police-station\r\nat any time for insulting behaviour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go, summon me,\" I roared, \"go at once, this very minute, this very\r\nsecond! You are a torturer all the same! a torturer!\"\r\n\r\nBut he merely looked at me, then turned, and regardless of my loud calls\r\nto him, he walked to his room with an even step and without looking\r\nround.\r\n\r\n\"If it had not been for Liza nothing of this would have happened,\" I\r\ndecided inwardly. Then, after waiting a minute, I went myself behind his\r\nscreen with a dignified and solemn air, though my heart was beating\r\nslowly and violently.\r\n\r\n\"Apollon,\" I said quietly and emphatically, though I was breathless, \"go\r\nat once without a minute's delay and fetch the police-officer.\"\r\n\r\nHe had meanwhile settled himself at his table, put on his spectacles and\r\ntaken up some sewing. But, hearing my order, he burst into a guffaw.\r\n\r\n\"At once, go this minute! Go on, or else you can't imagine what will\r\nhappen.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are certainly out of your mind,\" he observed, without even raising\r\nhis head, lisping as deliberately as ever and threading his needle.\r\n\"Whoever heard of a man sending for the police against himself? And as\r\nfor being frightened--you are upsetting yourself about nothing, for\r\nnothing will come of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go!\" I shrieked, clutching him by the shoulder. I felt I should strike\r\nhim in a minute.\r\n\r\nBut I did not notice the door from the passage softly and slowly open at\r\nthat instant and a figure come in, stop short, and begin staring at us\r\nin perplexity. I glanced, nearly swooned with shame, and rushed back to\r\nmy room. There, clutching at my hair with both hands, I leaned my head\r\nagainst the wall and stood motionless in that position.\r\n\r\nTwo minutes later I heard Apollon's deliberate footsteps. \"There is some\r\nwoman asking for you,\" he said, looking at me with peculiar severity.\r\nThen he stood aside and let in Liza. He would not go away, but stared at\r\nus sarcastically.\r\n\r\n\"Go away, go away,\" I commanded in desperation. At that moment my clock\r\nbegan whirring and wheezing and struck seven.\r\n\nIX\r\n\r\n \"Into my house come bold and free,\r\n Its rightful mistress there to be.\"\r\n\r\nI stood before her crushed, crestfallen, revoltingly confused, and I\r\nbelieve I smiled as I did my utmost to wrap myself in the skirts of my\r\nragged wadded dressing-gown--exactly as I had imagined the scene not\r\nlong before in a fit of depression. After standing over us for a couple\r\nof minutes Apollon went away, but that did not make me more at ease.\r\nWhat made it worse was that she, too, was overwhelmed with confusion,\r\nmore so, in fact, than I should have expected. At the sight of me, of\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down,\" I said mechanically, moving a chair up to the table, and I\r\nsat down on the sofa. She obediently sat down at once and gazed at me\r\nopen-eyed, evidently expecting something from me at once. This naivete\r\nof expectation drove me to fury, but I restrained myself.\r\n\r\nShe ought to have tried not to notice, as though everything had been as\r\nusual, while instead of that, she ... and I dimly felt that I should\r\nmake her pay dearly for _all this_.\r\n\r\n\"You have found me in a strange position, Liza,\" I began, stammering and\r\nknowing that this was the wrong way to begin. \"No, no, don't imagine\r\nanything,\" I cried, seeing that she had suddenly flushed. \"I am not\r\nashamed of my poverty.... On the contrary I look with pride on my\r\npoverty. I am poor but honourable.... One can be poor and honourable,\" I\r\nmuttered. \"However ... would you like tea?\"...\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she was beginning.\r\n\r\n\"Wait a minute.\"\r\n\r\nI leapt up and ran to Apollon. I had to get out of the room somehow.\r\n\r\n\"Apollon,\" I whispered in feverish haste, flinging down before him the\r\nseven roubles which had remained all the time in my clenched fist, \"here\r\nare your wages, you see I give them to you; but for that you must come\r\nto my rescue: bring me tea and a dozen rusks from the restaurant. If you\r\nwon't go, you'll make me a miserable man! You don't know what this woman\r\nis.... This is--everything! You may be imagining something.... But you\r\ndon't know what that woman is!\"...\r\n\r\nApollon, who had already sat down to his work and put on his spectacles\r\nagain, at first glanced askance at the money without speaking or putting\r\ndown his needle; then, without paying the slightest attention to me or\r\nmaking any answer he went on busying himself with his needle, which he\r\nhad not yet threaded. I waited before him for three minutes with my arms\r\ncrossed _a la Napoleon_. My temples were moist with sweat. I was pale, I\r\nfelt it. But, thank God, he must have been moved to pity, looking at me.\r\nHaving threaded his needle he deliberately got up from his seat,\r\ndeliberately moved back his chair, deliberately took off his spectacles,\r\ndeliberately counted the money, and finally asking me over his shoulder:\r\n\"Shall I get a whole portion?\" deliberately walked out of the room. As I\r\nwas going back to Liza, the thought occurred to me on the way: shouldn't\r\nI run away just as I was in my dressing-gown, no matter where, and then\r\nlet happen what would.\r\n\r\nI sat down again. She looked at me uneasily. For some minutes we were\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\n\"I will kill him,\" I shouted suddenly, striking the table with my fist\r\nso that the ink spurted out of the inkstand.\r\n\r\n\"What are you saying!\" she cried, starting.\r\n\r\n\"I will kill him! kill him!\" I shrieked, suddenly striking the table in\r\nabsolute frenzy, and at the same time fully understanding how stupid it\r\nwas to be in such a frenzy. \"You don't know, Liza, what that torturer is\r\nto me. He is my torturer.... He has gone now to fetch some rusks;\r\nhe....\"\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly I burst into tears. It was an hysterical attack. How\r\nashamed I felt in the midst of my sobs; but still I could not restrain\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nShe was frightened.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter? What is wrong?\" she cried, fussing about me.\r\n\r\n\"Water, give me water, over there!\" I muttered in a faint voice, though\r\nI was inwardly conscious that I could have got on very well without\r\nwater and without muttering in a faint voice. But I was, what is called,\r\n_putting it on_, to save appearances, though the attack was a genuine\r\none.\r\n\r\nShe gave me water, looking at me in bewilderment. At that moment Apollon\r\nbrought in the tea. It suddenly seemed to me that this commonplace,\r\nprosaic tea was horribly undignified and paltry after all that had\r\nhappened, and I blushed crimson. Liza looked at Apollon with positive\r\nalarm. He went out without a glance at either of us.\r\n\r\n\"Liza, do you despise me?\" I asked, looking at her fixedly, trembling\r\nwith impatience to know what she was thinking.\r\n\r\nShe was confused, and did not know what to answer.\r\n\r\n\"Drink your tea,\" I said to her angrily. I was angry with myself, but,\r\nof course, it was she who would have to pay for it. A horrible spite\r\nagainst her suddenly surged up in my heart; I believe I could have\r\nkilled her. To revenge myself on her I swore inwardly not to say a word\r\nto her all the time. \"She is the cause of it all,\" I thought.\r\n\r\nOur silence lasted for five minutes. The tea stood on the table; we did\r\nnot touch it. I had got to the point of purposely refraining from\r\nbeginning in order to embarrass her further; it was awkward for her to\r\nbegin alone. Several times she glanced at me with mournful perplexity. I\r\nwas obstinately silent. I was, of course, myself the chief sufferer,\r\nbecause I was fully conscious of the disgusting meanness of my spiteful\r\nstupidity, and yet at the same time I could not restrain myself.\r\n\r\n\"I want to ... get away ... from there altogether,\" she began, to break\r\nthe silence in some way, but, poor girl, that was just what she ought\r\nnot to have spoken about at such a stupid moment to a man so stupid as I\r\nwas. My heart positively ached with pity for her tactless and\r\nunnecessary straightforwardness. But something hideous at once stifled\r\nall compassion in me; it even provoked me to greater venom. I did not\r\ncare what happened. Another five minutes passed.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I am in your way,\" she began timidly, hardly audibly, and was\r\ngetting up.\r\n\r\nBut as soon as I saw this first impulse of wounded dignity I positively\r\ntrembled with spite, and at once burst out.\r\n\r\n\"Why have you come to me, tell me that, please?\" I began, gasping for\r\nbreath and regardless of logical connection in my words. I longed to\r\nhave it all out at once, at one burst; I did not even trouble how to\r\nbegin. \"Why have you come? Answer, answer,\" I cried, hardly knowing what\r\nI was doing. \"I'll tell you, my good girl, why you have come. You've\r\ncome because I talked sentimental stuff to you then. So now you are soft\r\nas butter and longing for fine sentiments again. So you may as well know\r\nthat I was laughing at you then. And I am laughing at you now. Why are\r\nyou shuddering? Yes, I was laughing at you! I had been insulted just\r\nbefore, at dinner, by the fellows who came that evening before me. I\r\ncame to you, meaning to thrash one of them, an officer; but I didn't\r\nsucceed, I didn't find him; I had to avenge the insult on some one to\r\nget back my own again; you turned up, I vented my spleen on you and\r\nlaughed at you. I had been humiliated, so I wanted to humiliate; I had\r\nbeen treated like a rag, so I wanted to show my power.... That's what it\r\nwas, and you imagined I had come there on purpose to save you. Yes? You\r\nimagined that? You imagined that?\"\r\n\r\nI knew that she would perhaps be muddled and not take it all in exactly,\r\nbut I knew, too, that she would grasp the gist of it, very well indeed.\r\nAnd so, indeed, she did. She turned white as a handkerchief, tried to\r\nsay something, and her lips worked painfully; but she sank on a chair as\r\nthough she had been felled by an axe. And all the time afterwards she\r\nlistened to me with her lips parted and her eyes wide open, shuddering\r\nwith awful terror. The cynicism, the cynicism of my words overwhelmed\r\nher....\r\n\r\n\"Save you!\" I went on, jumping up from my chair and running up and down\r\nthe room before her. \"Save you from what? But perhaps I am worse than\r\nyou myself. Why didn't you throw it in my teeth when I was giving you\r\nthat sermon: 'But what did you come here yourself for? was it to read us\r\na sermon?' Power, power was what I wanted then, sport was what I wanted,\r\nI wanted to wring out your tears, your humiliation, your hysteria--that\r\nwas what I wanted then! Of course, I couldn't keep it up then, because I\r\nam a wretched creature, I was frightened, and, the devil knows why, gave\r\nyou my address in my folly. Afterwards, before I got home, I was cursing\r\nand swearing at you because of that address, I hated you already because\r\nof the lies I had told you. Because I only like playing with words, only\r\ndreaming, but, do you know, what I really want is that you should all go\r\nto hell. That is what I want. I want peace; yes, I'd sell the whole\r\nworld for a farthing, straight off, so long as I was left in peace. Is\r\nthe world to go to pot, or am I to go without my tea? I say that the\r\nworld may go to pot for me so long as I always get my tea. Did you know\r\nthat, or not? Well, anyway, I know that I am a blackguard, a scoundrel,\r\nan egoist, a sluggard. Here I have been shuddering for the last three\r\ndays at the thought of your coming. And do you know what has worried me\r\nparticularly for these three days? That I posed as such a hero to you,\r\nand now you would see me in a wretched torn dressing-gown, beggarly,\r\nloathsome. I told you just now that I was not ashamed of my poverty; so\r\nyou may as well know that I am ashamed of it; I am more ashamed of it\r\nthan of anything, more afraid of it than of being found out if I were a\r\nthief, because I am as vain as though I had been skinned and the very\r\nair blowing on me hurt. Surely by now you must realize that I shall\r\nnever forgive you for having found me in this wretched dressing-gown,\r\njust as I was flying at Apollon like a spiteful cur. The saviour, the\r\nformer hero, was flying like a mangy, unkempt sheep-dog at his lackey,\r\nand the lackey was jeering at him! And I shall never forgive you for the\r\ntears I could not help shedding before you just now, like some silly\r\nwoman put to shame! And for what I am confessing to you now, I shall\r\nnever forgive _you_ either! Yes--you must answer for it all because you\r\nturned up like this, because I am a blackguard, because I am the\r\nnastiest, stupidest, absurdest and most envious of all the worms on\r\nearth, who are not a bit better than I am, but, the devil knows why, are\r\nnever put to confusion; while I shall always be insulted by every louse,\r\nthat is my doom! And what is it to me that you don't understand a word\r\nof this! And what do I care, what do I care about you, and whether you\r\ngo to ruin there or not? Do you understand? How I shall hate you now\r\nafter saying this, for having been here and listening. Why, it's not\r\nonce in a lifetime a man speaks out like this, and then it is in\r\nhysterics!... What more do you want? Why do you still stand confronting\r\nme, after all this? Why are you worrying me? Why don't you go?\"\r\n\r\nBut at this point a strange thing happened. I was so accustomed to think\r\nand imagine everything from books, and to picture everything in the\r\nworld to myself just as I had made it up in my dreams beforehand, that I\r\ncould not all at once take in this strange circumstance. What happened\r\nwas this: Liza, insulted and crushed by me, understood a great deal more\r\nthan I imagined. She understood from all this what a woman understands\r\nfirst of all, if she feels genuine love, that is, that I was myself\r\nunhappy.\r\n\r\nThe frightened and wounded expression on her face was followed first by\r\na look of sorrowful perplexity. When I began calling myself a scoundrel\r\nand a blackguard and my tears flowed (the tirade was accompanied\r\nthroughout by tears) her whole face worked convulsively. She was on the\r\npoint of getting up and stopping me; when I finished she took no notice\r\nof my shouting: \"Why are you here, why don't you go away?\" but realized\r\nonly that it must have been very bitter to me to say all this. Besides,\r\nshe was so crushed, poor girl; she considered herself infinitely beneath\r\nme; how could she feel anger or resentment? She suddenly leapt up from\r\nher chair with an irresistible impulse and held out her hands, yearning\r\ntowards me, though still timid and not daring to stir.... At this point\r\nthere was a revulsion in my heart, too. Then she suddenly rushed to me,\r\nthrew her arms round me and burst into tears. I, too, could not restrain\r\nmyself, and sobbed as I never had before.\r\n\r\n\"They won't let me.... I can't be good!\" I managed to articulate; then I\r\nwent to the sofa, fell on it face downwards, and sobbed on it for a\r\nquarter of an hour in genuine hysterics. She came close to me, put her\r\narms round me and stayed motionless in that position. But the trouble\r\nwas that the hysterics could not go on for ever, and (I am writing the\r\nloathsome truth) lying face downwards on the sofa with my face thrust\r\ninto my nasty leather pillow, I began by degrees to be aware of a\r\nfar-away, involuntary but irresistible feeling that it would be awkward\r\nnow for me to raise my head and look Liza straight in the face. Why was\r\nI ashamed? I don't know, but I was ashamed. The thought, too, came into\r\nmy overwrought brain that our parts now were completely changed, that\r\nshe was now the heroine, while I was just such a crushed and humiliated\r\ncreature as she had been before me that night--four days before.... And\r\nall this came into my mind during the minutes I was lying on my face on\r\nthe sofa.\r\n\r\nMy God! surely I was not envious of her then.\r\n\r\nI don't know, to this day I cannot decide, and at the time, of course, I\r\nwas still less able to understand what I was feeling than now. I cannot\r\nget on without domineering and tyrannizing over some one, but ... there\r\nis no explaining anything by reasoning and so it is useless to reason.\r\n\r\nI conquered myself, however, and raised my head; I had to do so sooner\r\nor later ... and I am convinced to this day that it was just because I\r\nwas ashamed to look at her that another feeling was suddenly kindled and\r\nflamed up in my heart ... a feeling of mastery and possession. My eyes\r\ngleamed with passion, and I gripped her hands tightly. How I hated her\r\nand how I was drawn to her at that minute! The one feeling intensified\r\nthe other. It was almost like an act of vengeance. At first there was a\r\nlook of amazement, even of terror on her face, but only for one instant.\r\nShe warmly and rapturously embraced me.\r\n\nX\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour later I was rushing up and down the room in\r\nfrenzied impatience, from minute to minute I went up to the screen and\r\npeeped through the crack at Liza. She was sitting on the ground with her\r\nhead leaning against the bed, and must have been crying. But she did not\r\ngo away, and that irritated me. This time she understood it all. I had\r\ninsulted her finally, but ... there's no need to describe it. She\r\nrealized that my outburst of passion had been simply revenge, a fresh\r\nhumiliation, and that to my earlier, almost causeless hatred was added\r\nnow a _personal hatred_, born of envy.... Though I do not maintain\r\npositively that she understood all this distinctly; but she certainly\r\ndid fully understand that I was a despicable man, and what was worse,\r\nincapable of loving her.\r\n\r\nI know I shall be told that this is incredible--but it is incredible to\r\nbe as spiteful and stupid as I was; it may be added that it was strange\r\nI should not love her, or at any rate, appreciate her love. Why is it\r\nstrange? In the first place, by then I was incapable of love, for I\r\nrepeat, with me loving meant tyrannizing and showing my moral\r\nsuperiority. I have never in my life been able to imagine any other sort\r\nof love, and have nowadays come to the point of sometimes thinking that\r\nlove really consists in the right--freely given by the beloved\r\nobject--to tyrannize over her.\r\n\r\nEven in my underground dreams I did not imagine love except as a\r\nstruggle. I began it always with hatred and ended it with moral\r\nsubjugation, and afterwards I never knew what to do with the subjugated\r\nobject. And what is there to wonder at in that, since I had succeeded in\r\nso corrupting myself, since I was so out of touch with \"real life,\" as\r\nto have actually thought of reproaching her, and putting her to shame\r\nfor having come to me to hear \"fine sentiments\"; and did not even guess\r\nthat she had come not to hear fine sentiments, but to love me, because\r\nto a woman all reformation, all salvation from any sort of ruin, and all\r\nmoral renewal is included in love and can only show itself in that form.\r\n\r\nI did not hate her so much, however, when I was running about the room\r\nand peeping through the crack in the screen. I was only insufferably\r\noppressed by her being here. I wanted her to disappear. I wanted\r\n\"peace,\" to be left alone in my underground world. Real life oppressed\r\nme with its novelty so much that I could hardly breathe.\r\n\r\nBut several minutes passed and she still remained, without stirring, as\r\nthough she were unconscious. I had the shamelessness to tap softly at\r\nthe screen as though to remind her.... She started, sprang up, and flew\r\nto seek her kerchief, her hat, her coat, as though making her escape\r\nfrom me.... Two minutes later she came from behind the screen and looked\r\nwith heavy eyes at me. I gave a spiteful grin, which was forced,\r\nhowever, to _keep up appearances_, and I turned away from her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye,\" she said, going towards the door.\r\n\r\nI ran up to her, seized her hand, opened it, thrust something in it and\r\nclosed it again. Then I turned at once and dashed away in haste to the\r\nother corner of the room to avoid seeing, anyway....\r\n\r\nI did mean a moment since to tell a lie--to write that I did this\r\naccidentally, not knowing what I was doing through foolishness, through\r\nlosing my head. But I don't want to lie, and so I will say straight out\r\nthat I opened her hand and put the money in it ... from spite. It came\r\ninto my head to do this while I was running up and down the room and she\r\nwas sitting behind the screen. But this I can say for certain: though I\r\ndid that cruel thing purposely, it was not an impulse from the heart,\r\nbut came from my evil brain. This cruelty was so affected, so purposely\r\nmade up, so completely a product of the brain, of books, that I could\r\nnot even keep it up a minute--first I dashed away to avoid seeing her,\r\nand then in shame and despair rushed after Liza. I opened the door in\r\nthe passage and began listening.\r\n\r\n\"Liza! Liza!\" I cried on the stairs, but in a low voice, not boldly.\r\n\r\nThere was no answer, but I fancied I heard her footsteps, lower down on\r\nthe stairs.\r\n\r\n\"Liza!\" I cried, more loudly.\r\n\r\nNo answer. But at that minute I heard the stiff outer glass door open\r\nheavily with a creak and slam violently, the sound echoed up the stairs.\r\n\r\nShe had gone. I went back to my room in hesitation. I felt horribly\r\noppressed.\r\n\r\nI stood still at the table, beside the chair on which she had sat and\r\nlooked aimlessly before me. A minute passed, suddenly I started;\r\nstraight before me on the table I saw.... In short, I saw a crumpled\r\nblue five-rouble note, the one I had thrust into her hand a minute\r\nbefore. It was the same note; it could be no other, there was no other\r\nin the flat. So she had managed to fling it from her hand on the table\r\nat the moment when I had dashed into the further corner.\r\n\r\nWell! I might have expected that she would do that. Might I have\r\nexpected it? No, I was such an egoist, I was so lacking in respect for\r\nmy fellow-creatures that I could not even imagine she would do so. I\r\ncould not endure it. A minute later I flew like a madman to dress,\r\nflinging on what I could at random and ran headlong after her. She could\r\nnot have got two hundred paces away when I ran out into the street.\r\n\r\nIt was a still night and the snow was coming down in masses and falling\r\nalmost perpendicularly, covering the pavement and the empty street as\r\nthough with a pillow. There was no one in the street, no sound was to be\r\nheard. The street lamps gave a disconsolate and useless glimmer. I ran\r\ntwo hundred paces to the cross-roads and stopped short.\r\n\r\nWhere had she gone? And why was I running after her?\r\n\r\nWhy? To fall down before her, to sob with remorse, to kiss her feet, to\r\nentreat her forgiveness! I longed for that, my whole breast was being\r\nrent to pieces, and never, never shall I recall that minute with\r\nindifference. But--what for? I thought. Should I not begin to hate her,\r\nperhaps, even to-morrow, just because I had kissed her feet to-day?\r\nShould I give her happiness? Had I not recognized that day, for the\r\nhundredth time, what I was worth? Should I not torture her?\r\n\r\nI stood in the snow, gazing into the troubled darkness and pondered\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\"And will it not be better?\" I mused fantastically, afterwards at home,\r\nstifling the living pang of my heart with fantastic dreams. \"Will it not\r\nbe better that she should keep the resentment of the insult for ever?\r\nResentment--why, it is purification; it is a most stinging and painful\r\nconsciousness! To-morrow I should have defiled her soul and have\r\nexhausted her heart, while now the feeling of insult will never die in\r\nher heart, and however loathsome the filth awaiting her--the feeling of\r\ninsult will elevate and purify her ... by hatred ... h'm! ... perhaps,\r\ntoo, by forgiveness.... Will all that make things easier for her\r\nthough?...\"\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, I will ask on my own account here, an idle question: which\r\nis better--cheap happiness or exalted sufferings? Well, which is better?\r\n\r\nSo I dreamed as I sat at home that evening, almost dead with the pain in\r\nmy soul. Never had I endured such suffering and remorse, yet could there\r\nhave been the faintest doubt when I ran out from my lodging that I\r\nshould turn back half-way? I never met Liza again and I have heard\r\nnothing of her. I will add, too, that I remained for a long time\r\nafterwards pleased with the phrase about the benefit from resentment and\r\nhatred in spite of the fact that I almost fell ill from misery.\r\n\r\n * * * * *\r\n\r\nEven now, so many years later, all this is somehow a very evil memory. I\r\nhave many evil memories now, but ... hadn't I better end my \"Notes\"\r\nhere? I believe I made a mistake in beginning to write them, anyway I\r\nhave felt ashamed all the time I've been writing this story; so it's\r\nhardly literature so much as a corrective punishment. Why, to tell long\r\nstories, showing how I have spoiled my life through morally rotting in\r\nmy corner, through lack of fitting environment, through divorce from\r\nreal life, and rankling spite in my underground world, would certainly\r\nnot be interesting; a novel needs a hero, and all the traits for an\r\nanti-hero are _expressly_ gathered together here, and what matters most,\r\nit all produces an unpleasant impression, for we are all divorced from\r\nlife, we are all cripples, every one of us, more or less. We are so\r\ndivorced from it that we feel at once a sort of loathing for real life,\r\nand so cannot bear to be reminded of it. Why, we have come almost to\r\nlooking upon real life as an effort, almost as hard work, and we are all\r\nprivately agreed that it is better in books. And why do we fuss and fume\r\nsometimes? Why are we perverse and ask for something else? We don't know\r\nwhat ourselves. It would be the worse for us if our petulant prayers\r\nwere answered. Come, try, give any one of us, for instance, a little\r\nmore independence, untie our hands, widen the spheres of our activity,\r\nrelax the control and we ... yes, I assure you ... we should be begging\r\nto be under control again at once. I know that you will very likely be\r\nangry with me for that, and will begin shouting and stamping. Speak for\r\nyourself, you will say, and for your miseries in your underground holes,\r\nand don't dare to say all of us--excuse me, gentlemen, I am not\r\njustifying myself with that \"all of us.\" As for what concerns me in\r\nparticular I have only in my life carried to an extreme what you have\r\nnot dared to carry half-way, and what's more, you have taken your\r\ncowardice for good sense, and have found comfort in deceiving\r\nyourselves. So that perhaps, after all, there is more life in me than in\r\nyou. Look into it more carefully! Why, we don't even know what living\r\nmeans now, what it is, and what it is called? Leave us alone without\r\nbooks and we shall be lost and in confusion at once. We shall not know\r\nwhat to join on to, what to cling to, what to love and what to hate,\r\nwhat to respect and what to despise. We are oppressed at being men--men\r\nwith a real individual body and blood, we are ashamed of it, we think it\r\na disgrace and try to contrive to be some sort of impossible generalized\r\nman. We are stillborn, and for generations past have been begotten, not\r\nby living fathers, and that suits us better and better. We are\r\ndeveloping a taste for it. Soon we shall contrive to be born somehow\r\nfrom an idea. But enough; I don't want to write more from \"Underground.\"\r\n\r\n [_The notes of this paradoxalist do not end here, however.\r\n He could not refrain from going on with them, but it seems\r\n to us that we may stop here._]\r\n\nA FAINT HEART\r\n\r\nA STORY\r\n\nUnder the same roof in the same flat on the same fourth storey lived two\r\nyoung men, colleagues in the service, Arkady Ivanovitch Nefedevitch and\r\nVasya Shumkov.... The author of course, feels the necessity of\r\nexplaining to the reader why one is given his full title, while the\r\nother's name is abbreviated, if only that such a mode of expression may\r\nnot be regarded as unseemly and rather familiar. But, to do so, it would\r\nfirst be necessary to explain and describe the rank and years and\r\ncalling and duty in the service, and even, indeed, the characters of the\r\npersons concerned; and since there are so many writers who begin in that\r\nway, the author of the proposed story, solely in order to be unlike them\r\n(that is, some people will perhaps say, entirely on account of his\r\nboundless vanity), decides to begin straightaway with action. Having\r\ncompleted this introduction, he begins.\r\n\r\nTowards six o'clock on New Year's Eve Shumkov returned home. Arkady\r\nIvanovitch, who was lying on the bed, woke up and looked at his friend\r\nwith half-closed eyes. He saw that Vasya had on his very best trousers\r\nand a very clean shirt front. That, of course, struck him. \"Where had\r\nVasya to go like that? And he had not dined at home either!\" Meanwhile,\r\nShumkov had lighted a candle, and Arkady Ivanovitch guessed immediately\r\nthat his friend was intending to wake him accidentally. Vasya did, in\r\nfact, clear his throat twice, walked twice up and down the room, and at\r\nlast, quite accidentally, let the pipe, which he had begun filling in\r\nthe corner by the stove, slip out of his hands. Arkady Ivanovitch\r\nlaughed to himself.\r\n\r\n\"Vasya, give over pretending!\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Arkasha, you are not asleep?\"\r\n\r\n\"I really cannot say for certain; it seems to me I am not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Arkasha! How are you, dear boy? Well, brother! Well, brother!...\r\nYou don't know what I have to tell you!\"\r\n\r\n\"I certainly don't know; come here.\"\r\n\r\nAs though expecting this, Vasya went up to him at once, not at all\r\nanticipating, however, treachery from Arkady Ivanovitch. The other\r\nseized him very adroitly by the arms, turned him over, held him down,\r\nand began, as it is called, \"strangling\" his victim, and apparently this\r\nproceeding afforded the lighthearted Arkady Ivanovitch great\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"Caught!\" he cried. \"Caught!\"\r\n\r\n\"Arkasha, Arkasha, what are you about? Let me go. For goodness sake, let\r\nme go, I shall crumple my dress coat!\"\r\n\r\n\"As though that mattered! What do you want with a dress coat? Why were\r\nyou so confiding as to put yourself in my hands? Tell me, where have you\r\nbeen? Where have you dined?\"\r\n\r\n\"Arkasha, for goodness sake, let me go!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where have you dined?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's about that I want to tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell away, then.\"\r\n\r\n\"But first let me go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit of it, I won't let you go till you tell me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Arkasha! Arkasha! But do you understand, I can't--it is utterly\r\nimpossible!\" cried Vasya, helplessly wriggling out of his friend's\r\npowerful clutches, \"you know there are subjects!\"\r\n\r\n\"How--subjects?\"...\r\n\r\n\"Why, subjects that you can't talk about in such a position without\r\nlosing your dignity; it's utterly impossible; it would make it\r\nridiculous, and this is not a ridiculous matter, it is important.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here, he's going in for being important! That's a new idea! You tell me\r\nso as to make me laugh, that's how you must tell me; I don't want\r\nanything important; or else you are no true friend of mine. Do you call\r\nyourself a friend? Eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Arkasha, I really can't!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't want to hear....\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Arkasha!\" began Vasya, lying across the bed and doing his utmost\r\nto put all the dignity possible into his words. \"Arkasha! If you like, I\r\nwill tell you; only....\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what?...\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I am engaged to be married!\"\r\n\r\nWithout uttering another word Arkady Ivanovitch took Vasya up in his\r\narms like a baby, though the latter was by no means short, but rather\r\nlong and thin, and began dexterously carrying him up and down the room,\r\npretending that he was hushing him to sleep.\r\n\r\n\"I'll put you in your swaddling clothes, Master Bridegroom,\" he kept\r\nsaying. But seeing that Vasya lay in his arms, not stirring or uttering\r\na word, he thought better of it at once, and reflecting that the joke\r\nhad gone too far, set him down in the middle of the room and kissed him\r\non the cheek in the most genuine and friendly way.\r\n\r\n\"Vasya, you are not angry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Arkasha, listen....\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, it's New Year's Eve.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm all right; but why are you such a madman, such a scatterbrain?\r\nHow many times I have told you: Arkasha, it's really not funny, not\r\nfunny at all!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, you are not angry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm all right; am I ever angry with any one! But you have wounded\r\nme, do you understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"But how have I wounded you? In what way?\"\r\n\r\n\"I come to you as to a friend, with a full heart, to pour out my soul to\r\nyou, to tell you of my happiness....\"\r\n\r\n\"What happiness? Why don't you speak?...\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, I am going to get married!\" Vasya answered with vexation, for\r\nhe really was a little exasperated.\r\n\r\n\"You! You are going to get married! So you really mean it?\" Arkasha\r\ncried at the top of his voice. \"No, no ... but what's this? He talks\r\nlike this and his tears are flowing.... Vasya, my little Vasya, don't,\r\nmy little son! Is it true, really?\" And Arkady Ivanovitch flew to hug\r\nhim again.\r\n\r\n\"Well, do you see, how it is now?\" said Vasya. \"You are kind, of course,\r\nyou are a friend, I know that. I come to you with such joy, such\r\nrapture, and all of a sudden I have to disclose all the joy of my heart,\r\nall my rapture struggling across the bed, in an undignified way.... You\r\nunderstand, Arkasha,\" Vasya went on, half laughing. \"You see, it made it\r\nseem comic: and in a sense I did not belong to myself at that minute. I\r\ncould not let this be slighted.... What's more, if you had asked me her\r\nname, I swear, I would sooner you killed me than have answered you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Vasya, why did you not speak! You should have told me all about it\r\nsooner and I would not have played the fool!\" cried Arkady Ivanovitch in\r\ngenuine despair.\r\n\r\n\"Come, that's enough, that's enough! Of course, that's how it is.... You\r\nknow what it all comes from--from my having a good heart. What vexes me\r\nis, that I could not tell you as I wanted to, making you glad and happy,\r\ntelling you nicely and initiating you into my secret properly....\r\nReally, Arkasha, I love you so much that I believe if it were not for\r\nyou I shouldn't be getting married, and, in fact, I shouldn't be living\r\nin this world at all!\"\r\n\r\nArkady Ivanovitch, who was excessively sentimental, cried and laughed at\r\nonce as he listened to Vasya. Vasya did the same. Both flew to embrace\r\none another again and forgot the past.\r\n\r\n\"How is it--how is it? Tell me all about it, Vasya! I am astonished,\r\nexcuse me, brother, but I am utterly astonished; it's a perfect\r\nthunderbolt, by Jove! Nonsense, nonsense, brother, you have made it up,\r\nyou've really made it up, you are telling fibs!\" cried Arkady\r\nIvanovitch, and he actually looked into Vasya's face with genuine\r\nuncertainty, but seeing in it the radiant confirmation of a positive\r\nintention of being married as soon as possible, threw himself on the bed\r\nand began rolling from side to side in ecstasy till the walls shook.\r\n\r\n\"Vasya, sit here,\" he said at last, sitting down on the bed.\r\n\r\n\"I really don't know, brother, where to begin!\"\r\n\r\nThey looked at one another in joyful excitement.\r\n\r\n\"Who is she, Vasya?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Artemyevs!...\" Vasya pronounced, in a voice weak with emotion.\r\n\r\n\"No?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I did buzz into your ears about them at first, and then I shut\r\nup, and you noticed nothing. Ah, Arkasha, if you knew how hard it was to\r\nkeep it from you; but I was afraid, afraid to speak! I thought it would\r\nall go wrong, and you know I was in love, Arkasha! My God! my God! You\r\nsee this was the trouble,\" he began, pausing continually from agitation,\r\n\"she had a suitor a year ago, but he was suddenly ordered somewhere; I\r\nknew him--he was a fellow, bless him! Well, he did not write at all, he\r\nsimply vanished. They waited and waited, wondering what it meant....\r\nFour months ago he suddenly came back married, and has never set foot\r\nwithin their doors! It was coarse--shabby! And they had no one to stand\r\nup for them. She cried and cried, poor girl, and I fell in love with her\r\n... indeed, I had been in love with her long before, all the time! I\r\nbegan comforting her, and was always going there.... Well, and I really\r\ndon't know how it has all come about, only she came to love me; a week\r\nago I could not restrain myself, I cried, I sobbed, and told her\r\neverything--well, that I love her--everything, in fact!... 'I am ready\r\nto love you, too, Vassily Petrovitch, only I am a poor girl, don't make\r\na mock of me; I don't dare to love any one.' Well, brother, you\r\nunderstand! You understand?... On that we got engaged on the spot. I\r\nkept thinking and thinking and thinking and thinking, I said to her,\r\n'How are we to tell your mother?' She said, 'It will be hard, wait a\r\nlittle; she's afraid, and now maybe she would not let you have me; she\r\nkeeps crying, too.' Without telling her I blurted it out to her mother\r\nto-day. Lizanka fell on her knees before her, I did the same ... well,\r\nshe gave us her blessing. Arkasha, Arkasha! My dear fellow! We will live\r\ntogether. No, I won't part from you for anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Vasya, look at you as I may, I can't believe it. I don't believe it, I\r\nswear. I keep feeling as though.... Listen, how can you be engaged to be\r\nmarried?... How is it I didn't know, eh? Do you know, Vasya, I will\r\nconfess it to you now. I was thinking of getting married myself; but now\r\nsince you are going to be married, it is just as good! Be happy, be\r\nhappy!...\"\r\n\r\n\"Brother, I feel so lighthearted now, there is such sweetness in my soul\r\n...\" said Vasya, getting up and pacing about the room excitedly. \"Don't\r\nyou feel the same? We shall be poor, of course, but we shall be happy;\r\nand you know it is not a wild fancy; our happiness is not a fairy tale;\r\nwe shall be happy in reality!...\"\r\n\r\n\"Vasya, Vasya, listen!\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" said Vasya, standing before Arkady Ivanovitch.\r\n\r\n\"The idea occurs to me; I am really afraid to say it to you.... Forgive\r\nme, and settle my doubts. What are you going to live on? You know I am\r\ndelighted that you are going to be married, of course, I am delighted,\r\nand I don't know what to do with myself, but--what are you going to live\r\non? Eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, good Heavens! What a fellow you are, Arkasha!\" said Vasya, looking\r\nat Nefedevitch in profound astonishment. \"What do you mean? Even her old\r\nmother, even she did not think of that for two minutes when I put it all\r\nclearly before her. You had better ask what they are living on! They\r\nhave five hundred roubles a year between the three of them: the pension,\r\nwhich is all they have, since the father died. She and her old mother\r\nand her little brother, whose schooling is paid for out of that income\r\ntoo--that is how they live! It's you and I are the capitalists! Some\r\ngood years it works out to as much as seven hundred for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, Vasya, excuse me; I really ... you know I ... I am only thinking\r\nhow to prevent things going wrong. How do you mean, seven hundred? It's\r\nonly three hundred....\"\r\n\r\n\"Three hundred!... And Yulian Mastakovitch? Have you forgotten him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yulian Mastakovitch? But you know that's uncertain, brother; that's not\r\nthe same thing as three hundred roubles of secure salary, where every\r\nrouble is a friend you can trust. Yulian Mastakovitch, of course, he's a\r\ngreat man, in fact, I respect him, I understand him, though he is so far\r\nabove us; and, by Jove, I love him, because he likes you and gives you\r\nsomething for your work, though he might not pay you, but simply order a\r\nclerk to work for him--but you will agree, Vasya.... Let me tell you,\r\ntoo, I am not talking nonsense. I admit in all Petersburg you won't find\r\na handwriting like your handwriting, I am ready to allow that to you,\"\r\nNefedevitch concluded, not without enthusiasm. \"But, God forbid! you may\r\ndisplease him all at once, you may not satisfy him, your work with him\r\nmay stop, he may take another clerk--all sorts of things may happen, in\r\nfact! You know, Yulian Mastakovitch may be here to-day and gone\r\nto-morrow....\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Arkasha, the ceiling might fall on our heads this minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, of course, of course, I mean nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"But listen, hear what I have got to say--you know, I don't see how he\r\ncan part with me.... No, hear what I have to say! hear what I have to\r\nsay! You see, I perform all my duties punctually; you know how kind he\r\nis, you know, Arkasha, he gave me fifty roubles in silver to-day!\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he really, Vasya? A bonus for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bonus, indeed, it was out of his own pocket. He said: 'Why, you have\r\nhad no money for five months, brother, take some if you want it; thank\r\nyou, I am satisfied with you.'... Yes, really! 'Yes, you don't work for\r\nme for nothing,' said he. He did, indeed, that's what he said. It\r\nbrought tears into my eyes, Arkasha. Good Heavens, yes!\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, Vasya, have you finished copying those papers?...\"\r\n\r\n\"No.... I haven't finished them yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Vas...ya! My angel! What have you been doing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Arkasha, it doesn't matter, they are not wanted for another two\r\ndays, I have time enough....\"\r\n\r\n\"How is it you have not done them?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right, that's all right. You look so horror-stricken that\r\nyou turn me inside out and make my heart ache! You are always going on\r\nat me like this! He's for ever crying out: Oh, oh, oh!!! Only consider,\r\nwhat does it matter? Why, I shall finish it, of course I shall finish\r\nit....\"\r\n\r\n\"What if you don't finish it?\" cried Arkady, jumping up, \"and he has\r\nmade you a present to-day! And you going to be married.... Tut, tut,\r\ntut!...\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all right, it's all right,\" cried Shumkov, \"I shall sit down\r\ndirectly, I shall sit down this minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you come to leave it, Vasya?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Arkasha! How could I sit down to work! Have I been in a fit state?\r\nWhy, even at the office I could scarcely sit still, I could scarcely\r\nbear the beating of my heart.... Oh! oh! Now I shall work all night, and\r\nI shall work all to-morrow night, and the night after, too--and I shall\r\nfinish it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there a great deal left?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't hinder me, for goodness' sake, don't hinder me; hold your\r\ntongue.\"\r\n\r\nArkady Ivanovitch went on tip-toe to the bed and sat down, then suddenly\r\nwanted to get up, but was obliged to sit down again, remembering that he\r\nmight interrupt him, though he could not sit still for excitement: it\r\nwas evident that the news had thoroughly upset him, and the first thrill\r\nof delight had not yet passed off. He glanced at Shumkov; the latter\r\nglanced at him, smiled, and shook his finger at him, then, frowning\r\nseverely (as though all his energy and the success of his work depended\r\nupon it), fixed his eyes on the papers.\r\n\r\nIt seemed that he, too, could not yet master his emotion; he kept\r\nchanging his pen, fidgeting in his chair, re-arranging things, and\r\nsetting to work again, but his hand trembled and refused to move.\r\n\r\n\"Arkasha, I've talked to them about you,\" he cried suddenly, as though\r\nhe had just remembered it.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" cried Arkasha, \"I was just wanting to ask you that. Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll tell you everything afterwards. Of course, it is my own\r\nfault, but it quite went out of my head that I didn't mean to say\r\nanything till I had written four pages, but I thought of you and of\r\nthem. I really can't write, brother, I keep thinking about you....\"\r\n\r\nVasya smiled.\r\n\r\nA silence followed.\r\n\r\n\"Phew! What a horrid pen,\" cried Shumkov, flinging it on the table in\r\nvexation. He took another.\r\n\r\n\"Vasya! listen! one word....\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, make haste, and for the last time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you a great deal left to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, brother!\" Vasya frowned, as though there could be nothing more\r\nterrible and murderous in the whole world than such a question. \"A lot,\r\na fearful lot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, I have an idea----\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, never mind, never mind; go on writing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, what? what?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's past six, Vasya.\"\r\n\r\nHere Nefedevitch smiled and winked slyly at Vasya, though with a certain\r\ntimidity, not knowing how Vasya would take it.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what is it?\" said Vasya, throwing down his pen, looking him\r\nstraight in the face and actually turning pale with excitement.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what?\"\r\n\r\n\"For goodness sake, what is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you what, you are excited, you won't get much done.... Stop,\r\nstop, stop! I have it, I have it--listen,\" said Nefedevitch, jumping up\r\nfrom the bed in delight, preventing Vasya from speaking and doing his\r\nutmost to ward off all objections; \"first of all you must get calm, you\r\nmust pull yourself together, mustn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Arkasha, Arkasha!\" cried Vasya, jumping up from his chair, \"I will work\r\nall night, I will, really.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, of course, you won't go to bed till morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't go to bed, I won't go to bed at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, that won't do, that won't do: you must sleep, go to bed at five. I\r\nwill call you at eight. To-morrow is a holiday; you can sit and scribble\r\naway all day long.... Then the night and--but have you a great deal left\r\nto do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, look, look!\"\r\n\r\nVasya, quivering with excitement and suspense, showed the manuscript:\r\n\"Look!\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, brother, that's not much.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear fellow, there's some more of it,\" said Vasya, looking very\r\ntimidly at Nefedevitch, as though the decision whether he was to go or\r\nnot depended upon the latter.\r\n\r\n\"How much?\"\r\n\r\n\"Two signatures.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what's that? Come, I tell you what. We shall have time to finish\r\nit, by Jove, we shall!\"\r\n\r\n\"Arkasha!\"\r\n\r\n\"Vasya, listen! To-night, on New Year's Eve, every one is at home with\r\nhis family. You and I are the only ones without a home or relations....\r\nOh, Vasya!\"\r\n\r\nNefedevitch clutched Vasya and hugged him in his leonine arms.\r\n\r\n\"Arkasha, it's settled.\"\r\n\r\n\"Vasya, boy, I only wanted to say this. You see, Vasya--listen,\r\nbandy-legs, listen!...\"\r\n\r\nArkady stopped, with his mouth open, because he could not speak for\r\ndelight. Vasya held him by the shoulders, gazed into his face and moved\r\nhis lips, as though he wanted to speak for him.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he brought out at last.\r\n\r\n\"Introduce me to them to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Arkady, let us go to tea there. I tell you what, I tell you what. We\r\nwon't even stay to see in the New Year, we'll come away earlier,\" cried\r\nVasya, with genuine inspiration.\r\n\r\n\"That is, we'll go for two hours, neither more nor less....\"\r\n\r\n\"And then separation till I have finished....\"\r\n\r\n\"Vasya, boy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Arkady!\"\r\n\r\nThree minutes later Arkady was dressed in his best. Vasya did nothing\r\nbut brush himself, because he had been in such haste to work that he had\r\nnot changed his trousers.\r\n\r\nThey hurried out into the street, each more pleased than the other.\r\nTheir way lay from the Petersburg Side to Kolomna. Arkady Ivanovitch\r\nstepped out boldly and vigorously, so that from his walk alone one could\r\nsee how glad he was at the good fortune of his friend, who was more and\r\nmore radiant with happiness. Vasya trotted along with shorter steps,\r\nthough his deportment was none the less dignified. Arkady Ivanovitch, in\r\nfact, had never seen him before to such advantage. At that moment he\r\nactually felt more respect for him, and Vasya's physical defect, of\r\nwhich the reader is not yet aware (Vasya was slightly deformed), which\r\nalways called forth a feeling of loving sympathy in Arkady Ivanovitch's\r\nkind heart, contributed to the deep tenderness the latter felt for him\r\nat this moment, a tenderness of which Vasya was in every way worthy.\r\nArkady Ivanovitch felt ready to weep with happiness, but he restrained\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going, where are you going, Vasya? It is nearer this\r\nway,\" he cried, seeing that Vasya was making in the direction of\r\nVoznesenky.\r\n\r\n\"Hold your tongue, Arkasha.\"\r\n\r\n\"It really is nearer, Vasya.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what, Arkasha?\" Vasya began mysteriously, in a voice\r\nquivering with joy, \"I tell you what, I want to take Lizanka a little\r\npresent.\"\r\n\r\n\"What sort of present?\"\r\n\r\n\"At the corner here, brother, is Madame Leroux's, a wonderful shop.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well.\"\r\n\r\n\"A cap, my dear, a cap; I saw such a charming little cap to-day. I\r\ninquired, I was told it was the _facon Manon Lescaut_--a delightful\r\nthing. Cherry-coloured ribbons, and if it is not dear ... Arkasha, even\r\nif it is dear....\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you are superior to any of the poets, Vasya. Come along.\"\r\n\r\nThey ran along, and two minutes later went into the shop. They were met\r\nby a black-eyed Frenchwoman with curls, who, from the first glance at\r\nher customers, became as joyous and happy as they, even happier, if one\r\nmay say so. Vasya was ready to kiss Madame Leroux in his delight....\r\n\r\n\"Arkasha,\" he said in an undertone, casting a casual glance at all the\r\ngrand and beautiful things on little wooden stands on the huge table,\r\n\"lovely things! What's that? What's this? This one, for instance, this\r\nlittle sweet, do you see?\" Vasya whispered, pointing to a charming cap\r\nfurther away, which was not the one he meant to buy, because he had\r\nalready from afar descried and fixed his eyes upon the real, famous one,\r\nstanding at the other end. He looked at it in such a way that one might\r\nhave supposed some one was going to steal it, or as though the cap\r\nitself might take wings and fly into the air just to prevent Vasya from\r\nobtaining it.\r\n\r\n\"Look,\" said Arkady Ivanovitch, pointing to one, \"I think that's\r\nbetter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Arkasha, that does you credit; I begin to respect you for your\r\ntaste,\" said Vasya, resorting to cunning with Arkasha in the tenderness\r\nof his heart, \"your cap is charming, but come this way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is there a better one, brother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Look; this way.\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said Arkady, doubtfully.\r\n\r\nBut when Vasya, incapable of restraining himself any longer, took it\r\nfrom the stand from which it seemed to fly spontaneously, as though\r\ndelighted at falling at last into the hands of so good a customer, and\r\nthey heard the rustle of its ribbons, ruches and lace, an unexpected cry\r\nof delight broke from the powerful chest of Arkady Ivanovitch. Even\r\nMadame Leroux, while maintaining her incontestable dignity and\r\npre-eminence in matters of taste, and remaining mute from condescension,\r\nrewarded Vasya with a smile of complete approbation, everything in her\r\nglance, gesture and smile saying at once: \"Yes, you have chosen rightly,\r\nand are worthy of the happiness which awaits you.\"\r\n\r\n\"It has been dangling its charms in coy seclusion,\" cried Vasya,\r\ntransferring his tender feelings to the charming cap. \"You have been\r\nhiding on purpose, you sly little pet!\" And he kissed it, that is the\r\nair surrounding it, for he was afraid to touch his treasure.\r\n\r\n\"Retiring as true worth and virtue,\" Arkady added enthusiastically,\r\nquoting humorously from a comic paper he had read that morning. \"Well,\r\nVasya?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah, Arkasha! You are witty to-day. I predict you will make a\r\nsensation, as women say. Madame Leroux, Madame Leroux!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is your pleasure?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear Madame Leroux.\"\r\n\r\nMadame Leroux looked at Arkady Ivanovitch and smiled condescendingly.\r\n\r\n\"You wouldn't believe how I adore you at this moment.... Allow me to\r\ngive you a kiss....\" And Vasya kissed the shopkeeper.\r\n\r\nShe certainly at that moment needed all her dignity to maintain her\r\nposition with such a madcap. But I contend that the innate, spontaneous\r\ncourtesy and grace with which Madame Leroux received Vasya's enthusiasm,\r\nwas equally befitting. She forgave him, and how tactfully, how\r\ngraciously, she knew how to behave in the circumstances. How could she\r\nhave been angry with Vasya?\r\n\r\n\"Madame Leroux, how much?\"\r\n\r\n\"Five roubles in silver,\" she answered, straightening herself with a new\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\"And this one, Madame Leroux?\" said Arkady Ivanovitch, pointing to his\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\n\"That one is eight roubles.\"\r\n\r\n\"There, you see--there, you see! Come, Madame Leroux, tell me which is\r\nnicer, more graceful, more charming, which of them suits you best?\"\r\n\r\n\"The second is richer, but your choice _c'est plus coquet_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we will take it.\"\r\n\r\nMadame Leroux took a sheet of very delicate paper, pinned it up, and the\r\npaper with the cap wrapped in it seemed even lighter than the paper\r\nalone. Vasya took it carefully, almost holding his breath, bowed to\r\nMadame Leroux, said something else very polite to her and left the shop.\r\n\r\n\"I am a lady's man, I was born to be a lady's man,\" said Vasya, laughing\r\na little noiseless, nervous laugh and dodging the passers-by, whom he\r\nsuspected of designs for crushing his precious cap.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Arkady, brother,\" he began a minute later, and there was a note\r\nof triumph, of infinite affection in his voice. \"Arkady, I am so happy,\r\nI am so happy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Vasya! how glad I am, dear boy!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Arkasha, no. I know that there is no limit to your affection for\r\nme; but you cannot be feeling one-hundredth part of what I am feeling at\r\nthis moment. My heart is so full, so full! Arkasha, I am not worthy of\r\nsuch happiness. I feel that, I am conscious of it. Why has it come to\r\nme?\" he said, his voice full of stifled sobs. \"What have I done to\r\ndeserve it? Tell me. Look what lots of people, what lots of tears, what\r\nsorrow, what work-a-day life without a holiday, while I, I am loved by a\r\ngirl like that, I.... But you will see her yourself immediately, you\r\nwill appreciate her noble heart. I was born in a humble station, now I\r\nhave a grade in the service and an independent income--my salary. I was\r\nborn with a physical defect, I am a little deformed. See, she loves me\r\nas I am. Yulian Mastakovitch was so kind, so attentive, so gracious\r\nto-day; he does not often talk to me; he came up to me: 'Well, how goes\r\nit, Vasya' (yes, really, he called me Vasya), 'are you going to have a\r\ngood time for the holiday, eh?' he laughed.\r\n\r\n\"'Well, the fact is, Your Excellency, I have work to do,' but then I\r\nplucked up courage and said: 'and maybe I shall have a good time, too,\r\nYour Excellency.' I really said it. He gave me the money, on the spot,\r\nthen he said a couple of words more to me. Tears came into my eyes,\r\nbrother, I actually cried, and he, too, seemed touched, he patted me on\r\nthe shoulder, and said: 'Feel always, Vasya, as you feel this now.'\"\r\n\r\nVasya paused for an instant. Arkady Ivanovitch turned away, and he, too,\r\nwiped away a tear with his fist.\r\n\r\n\"And, and ...\" Vasya went on, \"I have never spoken to you of this,\r\nArkady.... Arkady, you make me so happy with your affection, without you\r\nI could not live,--no, no, don't say anything, Arkady, let me squeeze\r\nyour hand, let me ... tha...ank ... you....\" Again Vasya could not\r\nfinish.\r\n\r\nArkady Ivanovitch longed to throw himself on Vasya's neck, but as they\r\nwere crossing the road and heard almost in their ears a shrill: \"Hi!\r\nthere!\" they ran frightened and excited to the pavement.\r\n\r\nArkady Ivanovitch was positively relieved. He set down Vasya's outburst\r\nof gratitude to the exceptional circumstances of the moment. He was\r\nvexed. He felt that he had done so little for Vasya hitherto. He felt\r\nactually ashamed of himself when Vasya began thanking him for so little.\r\nBut they had all their lives before them, and Arkady Ivanovitch breathed\r\nmore freely.\r\n\r\nThe Artemyevs had quite given up expecting them. The proof of it was\r\nthat they had already sat down to tea! And the old, it seems, are\r\nsometimes more clear-sighted than the young, even when the young are so\r\nexceptional. Lizanka had very earnestly maintained, \"He isn't coming, he\r\nisn't coming, Mamma; I feel in my heart he is not coming;\" while her\r\nmother on the contrary declared \"that she had a feeling that he would\r\ncertainly come, that he would not stay away, that he would run round,\r\nthat he could have no office work now, on New Year's Eve.\" Even as\r\nLizanka opened the door she did not in the least expect to see them, and\r\ngreeted them breathlessly, with her heart throbbing like a captured\r\nbird's, flushing and turning as red as a cherry, a fruit which she\r\nwonderfully resembled. Good Heavens, what a surprise it was! What a\r\njoyful \"Oh!\" broke from her lips. \"Deceiver! My darling!\" she cried,\r\nthrowing her arms round Vasya's neck. But imagine her amazement, her\r\nsudden confusion: just behind Vasya, as though trying to hide behind his\r\nback, stood Arkady Ivanovitch, a trifle out of countenance. It must be\r\nadmitted that he was awkward in the company of women, very awkward\r\nindeed, in fact on one occasion something occurred ... but of that later.\r\nYou must put yourself in his place, however. There was nothing to laugh\r\nat; he was standing in the entry, in his goloshes and overcoat, and in a\r\ncap with flaps over the ears, which he would have hastened to pull off,\r\nbut he had, all twisted round in a hideous way, a yellow knitted scarf,\r\nwhich, to make things worse, was knotted at the back. He had to\r\ndisentangle all this, to take it off as quickly as possible, to show\r\nhimself to more advantage, for there is no one who does not prefer to\r\nshow himself to advantage. And then Vasya, vexatious insufferable Vasya,\r\nof course always the same dear kind Vasya, but now insufferable,\r\nruthless Vasya. \"Here,\" he shouted, \"Lizanka, I have brought you my\r\nArkady? What do you think of him? He is my best friend, embrace him,\r\nkiss him, Lizanka, give him a kiss in advance; afterwards--you will know\r\nhim better--you can take it back again.\"\r\n\r\nWell, what, I ask you, was Arkady Ivanovitch to do? And he had only\r\nuntwisted half of the scarf so far. I really am sometimes ashamed of\r\nVasya's excess of enthusiasm; it is, of course, the sign of a good\r\nheart, but ... it's awkward, not nice!\r\n\r\nAt last both went in.... The mother was unutterably delighted to make\r\nArkady Ivanovitch's acquaintance, \"she had heard so much about him, she\r\nhad....\" But she did not finish. A joyful \"Oh!\" ringing musically\r\nthrough the room interrupted her in the middle of a sentence. Good\r\nHeavens! Lizanka was standing before the cap which had suddenly been\r\nunfolded before her gaze; she clasped her hands with the utmost\r\nsimplicity, smiling such a smile.... Oh, Heavens! why had not Madame\r\nLeroux an even lovelier cap?\r\n\r\nOh, Heavens! but where could you find a lovelier cap? It was quite\r\nfirst-rate. Where could you get a better one? I mean it seriously. This\r\ningratitude on the part of lovers moves me, in fact, to indignation and\r\neven wounds me a little. Why, look at it for yourself, reader, look,\r\nwhat could be more beautiful than this little love of a cap? Come, look\r\nat it.... But, no, no, my strictures are uncalled for; they had by now\r\nall agreed with me; it had been a momentary aberration; the blindness,\r\nthe delirium of feeling; I am ready to forgive them.... But then you\r\nmust look.... You must excuse me, kind reader, I am still talking about\r\nthe cap: made of tulle, light as a feather, a broad cherry-coloured\r\nribbon covered with lace passing between the tulle and the ruche, and at\r\nthe back two wide long ribbons--they would fall down a little below the\r\nnape of the neck.... All that the cap needed was to be tilted a little\r\nto the back of the head; come, look at it; I ask you, after that ... but\r\nI see you are not looking ... you think it does not matter. You are\r\nlooking in a different direction.... You are looking at two big tears,\r\nbig as pearls, that rose in two jet black eyes, quivered for one instant\r\non the eyelashes, and then dropped on the ethereal tulle of which Madame\r\nLeroux's artistic masterpiece was composed.... And again I feel vexed,\r\nthose two tears were scarcely a tribute to the cap.... No, to my mind,\r\nsuch a gift should be given in cool blood, as only then can its full\r\nworth be appreciated. I am, I confess, dear reader, entirely on the side\r\nof the cap.\r\n\r\nThey sat down--Vasya with Lizanka and the old mother with Arkady\r\nIvanovitch; they began to talk, and Arkady Ivanovitch did himself\r\ncredit, I am glad to say that for him. One would hardly, indeed, have\r\nexpected it of him. After a couple of words about Vasya he most\r\nsuccessfully turned the conversation to Yulian Mastakovitch, his patron.\r\nAnd he talked so cleverly, so cleverly that the subject was not\r\nexhausted for an hour. You ought to have seen with what dexterity, what\r\ntact, Arkady Ivanovitch touched upon certain peculiarities of Yulian\r\nMastakovitch which directly or indirectly affected Vasya. The mother was\r\nfascinated, genuinely fascinated; she admitted it herself; she purposely\r\ncalled Vasya aside, and said to him that his friend was a most excellent\r\nand charming young man, and, what was of most account, such a serious,\r\nsteady young man. Vasya almost laughed aloud with delight. He remembered\r\nhow the serious Arkady had tumbled him on his bed for a quarter of an\r\nhour. Then the mother signed to Vasya to follow her quietly and\r\ncautiously into the next room. It must be admitted that she treated\r\nLizanka rather unfairly: she behaved treacherously to her daughter, in\r\nthe fullness of her heart, of course, and showed Vasya on the sly the\r\npresent Lizanka was preparing to give him for the New Year. It was a\r\npaper-case, embroidered in beads and gold in a very choice design: on\r\none side was depicted a stag, absolutely lifelike, running swiftly, and\r\nso well done! On the other side was the portrait of a celebrated\r\nGeneral, also an excellent likeness. I cannot describe Vasya's raptures.\r\nMeanwhile, time was not being wasted in the parlour. Lizanka went\r\nstraight up to Arkady Ivanovitch. She took his hand, she thanked him for\r\nsomething, and Arkady Ivanovitch gathered that she was referring to her\r\nprecious Vasya. Lizanka was, indeed, deeply touched: she had heard that\r\nArkady Ivanovitch was such a true friend of her betrothed, so loved him,\r\nso watched over him, guiding him at every step with helpful advice, that\r\nshe, Lizanka, could hardly help thanking him, could not refrain from\r\nfeeling grateful, and hoping that Arkady Ivanovitch might like her, if\r\nonly half as well as Vasya. Then she began questioning him as to whether\r\nVasya was careful of his health, expressed some apprehensions in regard\r\nto his marked impulsiveness of character, and his lack of knowledge of\r\nmen and practical life; she said that she would in time watch over him\r\nreligiously, that she would take care of and cherish his lot, and\r\nfinally, she hoped that Arkady Ivanovitch would not leave them, but\r\nwould live with them.\r\n\r\n\"We three shall live like one,\" she cried, with extremely naive\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nBut it was time to go. They tried, of course, to keep them, but Vasya\r\nanswered point blank that it was impossible. Arkady Ivanovitch said the\r\nsame. The reason was, of course, inquired into, and it came out at once\r\nthat there was work to be done entrusted to Vasya by Yulian\r\nMastakovitch, urgent, necessary, dreadful work, which must be handed in\r\non the morning of the next day but one, and that it was not only\r\nunfinished, but had been completely laid aside. The mamma sighed when\r\nshe heard of this, while Lizanka was positively scared, and hurried\r\nVasya off in alarm. The last kiss lost nothing from this haste; though\r\nbrief and hurried it was only the more warm and ardent. At last they\r\nparted and the two friends set off home.\r\n\r\nBoth began at once confiding to each other their impressions as soon as\r\nthey found themselves in the street. And could they help it? Indeed,\r\nArkady Ivanovitch was in love, desperately in love, with Lizanka. And to\r\nwhom could he better confide his feelings than to Vasya, the happy man\r\nhimself. And so he did; he was not bashful, but confessed everything at\r\nonce to Vasya. Vasya laughed heartily and was immensely delighted, and\r\neven observed that this was all that was needed to make them greater\r\nfriends than ever. \"You have guessed my feelings, Vasya,\" said Arkady\r\nIvanovitch. \"Yes, I love her as I love you; she will be my good angel as\r\nwell as yours, for the radiance of your happiness will be shed on me,\r\ntoo, and I can bask in its warmth. She will keep house for me too,\r\nVasya; my happiness will be in her hands. Let her keep house for me as\r\nshe will for you. Yes, friendship for you is friendship for her; you are\r\nnot separable for me now, only I shall have two beings like you instead\r\nof one....\" Arkady paused in the fullness of his feelings, while Vasya\r\nwas shaken to the depths of his being by his friend's words. The fact\r\nis, he had never expected anything of the sort from Arkady. Arkady\r\nIvanovitch was not very great at talking as a rule, he was not fond of\r\ndreaming, either; now he gave way to the liveliest, freshest,\r\nrainbow-tinted day-dreams. \"How I will protect and cherish you both,\" he\r\nbegan again. \"To begin with, Vasya, I will be godfather to all your\r\nchildren, every one of them; and secondly, Vasya, we must bestir\r\nourselves about the future. We must buy furniture, and take a lodging so\r\nthat you and she and I can each have a little room to ourselves. Do you\r\nknow, Vasya, I'll run about to-morrow and look at the notices, on the\r\ngates! Three ... no, two rooms, we should not need more. I really\r\nbelieve, Vasya, I talked nonsense this morning, there will be money\r\nenough; why, as soon as I glanced into her eyes I calculated at once\r\nthat there would be enough to live on. It will all be for her. Oh, how\r\nwe will work! Now, Vasya, we might venture up to twenty-five roubles for\r\nrent. A lodging is everything, brother. Nice rooms ... and at once a man\r\nis cheerful, and his dreams are of the brightest hues. And, besides,\r\nLizanka will keep the purse for both of us: not a farthing will be\r\nwasted. Do you suppose I would go to a restaurant? What do you take me\r\nfor? Not on any account. And then we shall get a bonus and reward, for\r\nwe shall be zealous in the service--oh! how we shall work, like oxen\r\ntoiling in the fields.... Only fancy,\" and Arkady Ivanovitch's voice was\r\nfaint with pleasure, \"all at once and quite unexpected, twenty-five or\r\nthirty roubles.... Whenever there's an extra, there'll be a cap or a\r\nscarf or a pair of little stockings. She must knit me a scarf; look what\r\na horrid one I've got, the nasty yellow thing, it did me a bad turn\r\nto-day! And you wore a nice one, Vasya, to introduce me while I had my\r\nhead in a halter.... Though never mind that now. And look here, I\r\nundertake all the silver. I am bound to give you some little\r\npresent,--that will be an honour, that will flatter my vanity.... My\r\nbonuses won't fail me, surely; you don't suppose they would give them to\r\nSkorohodov? No fear, they won't be landed in that person's pocket. I'll\r\nbuy you silver spoons, brother, good knives--not silver knives, but\r\nthoroughly good ones; and a waistcoat, that is a waistcoat for myself. I\r\nshall be best man, of course. Only now, brother, you must keep at it,\r\nyou must keep at it. I shall stand over you with a stick, brother,\r\nto-day and to-morrow and all night; I shall worry you to work. Finish,\r\nmake haste and finish, brother. And then again to spend the evening, and\r\nthen again both of us happy; we will go in for loto. We will spend the\r\nevening there--oh, it's jolly! Oh, the devil! How, vexing it is I can't\r\nhelp you. I should like to take it and write it all for you.... Why is\r\nit our handwriting is not alike?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Vasya. \"Yes, I must make haste. I think it must be\r\neleven o'clock; we must make haste.... To work!\" And saying this, Vasya,\r\nwho had been all the time alternately smiling and trying to interrupt\r\nwith some enthusiastic rejoinder the flow of his friend's feelings, and\r\nhad, in short, been showing the most cordial response, suddenly\r\nsubsided, sank into silence, and almost ran along the street. It seemed\r\nas though some burdensome idea had suddenly chilled his feverish head;\r\nhe seemed all at once dispirited.\r\n\r\nArkady Ivanovitch felt quite uneasy; he scarcely got an answer to his\r\nhurried questions from Vasya, who confined himself to a word or two,\r\nsometimes an irrelevant exclamation.\r\n\r\n\"Why, what is the matter with you, Vasya?\" he cried at last, hardly able\r\nto keep up with him. \"Can you really be so uneasy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, brother, that's enough chatter!\" Vasya answered, with vexation.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be depressed, Vasya--come, come,\" Arkady interposed. \"Why, I have\r\nknown you write much more in a shorter time! What's the matter? You've\r\nsimply a talent for it! You can write quickly in an emergency; they are\r\nnot going to lithograph your copy. You've plenty of time!... The only\r\nthing is that you are excited now, and preoccupied, and the work won't\r\ngo so easily.\"\r\n\r\nVasya made no reply, or muttered something to himself, and they both ran\r\nhome in genuine anxiety.\r\n\r\nVasya sat down to the papers at once. Arkady Ivanovitch was quiet and\r\nsilent; he noiselessly undressed and went to bed, keeping his eyes fixed\r\non Vasya.... A sort of panic came over him.... \"What is the matter with\r\nhim?\" he thought to himself, looking at Vasya's face that grew whiter\r\nand whiter, at his feverish eyes, at the anxiety that was betrayed in\r\nevery movement he made, \"why, his hand is shaking ... what a stupid! Why\r\ndid I not advise him to sleep for a couple of hours, till he had slept\r\noff his nervous excitement, any way.\" Vasya had just finished a page, he\r\nraised his eyes, glanced casually at Arkady and at once, looking down,\r\ntook up his pen again.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Vasya,\" Arkady Ivanovitch began suddenly, \"wouldn't it be best\r\nto sleep a little now? Look, you are in a regular fever.\"\r\n\r\nVasya glanced at Arkady with vexation, almost with anger, and made no\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Vasya, you'll make yourself ill.\"\r\n\r\nVasya at once changed his mind. \"How would it be to have tea, Arkady?\"\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n\"How so? Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"It will do me good. I am not sleepy, I'm not going to bed! I am going\r\non writing. But now I should like to rest and have a cup of tea, and the\r\nworst moment will be over.\"\r\n\r\n\"First-rate, brother Vasya, delightful! Just so. I was wanting to\r\npropose it myself. And I can't think why it did not occur to me to do\r\nso. But I say, Mavra won't get up, she won't wake for anything....\"\r\n\r\n\"True.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's no matter, though,\" cried Arkady Ivanovitch, leaping out of bed.\r\n\"I will set the samovar myself. It won't be the first time....\"\r\n\r\nArkady Ivanovitch ran to the kitchen and set to work to get the samovar;\r\nVasya meanwhile went on writing. Arkady Ivanovitch, moreover, dressed\r\nand ran out to the baker's, so that Vasya might have something to\r\nsustain him for the night. A quarter of an hour later the samovar was on\r\nthe table. They began drinking tea, but conversation flagged. Vasya\r\nstill seemed preoccupied.\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow,\" he said at last, as though he had just thought of it, \"I\r\nshall have to take my congratulations for the New Year....\"\r\n\r\n\"You need not go at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, brother, I must,\" said Vasya.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I will sign the visitors' book for you everywhere.... How can you?\r\nYou work to-morrow. You must work to-night, till five o'clock in the\r\nmorning, as I said, and then get to bed. Or else you will be good for\r\nnothing to-morrow. I'll wake you at eight o'clock, punctually.\"\r\n\r\n\"But will it be all right, your signing for me?\" said Vasya, half\r\nassenting.\r\n\r\n\"Why, what could be better? Everyone does it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am really afraid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, why?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all right, you know, with other people, but Yulian Mastakovitch\r\n... he has been so kind to me, you know, Arkasha, and when he notices\r\nit's not my own signature----\"\r\n\r\n\"Notices! why, what a fellow you are, really, Vasya! How could he\r\nnotice?... Come, you know I can imitate your signature awfully well, and\r\nmake just the same flourish to it, upon my word I can. What nonsense!\r\nWho would notice?\"\r\n\r\nVasya, made no reply, but emptied his glass hurriedly.... Then he shook\r\nhis head doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"Vasya, dear boy! Ah, if only we succeed! Vasya, what's the matter with\r\nyou, you quite frighten me! Do you know, Vasya, I am not going to bed\r\nnow, I am not going to sleep! Show me, have you a great deal left?\"\r\n\r\nVasya gave Arkady such a look that his heart sank, and his tongue failed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Vasya, what is the matter? What are you thinking? Why do you look like\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Arkady, I really must go to-morrow to wish Yulian Mastakovitch a happy\r\nNew Year.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, go then!\" said Arkady, gazing at him open-eyed, in uneasy\r\nexpectation. \"I say, Vasya, do write faster; I am advising you for your\r\ngood, I really am! How often Yulian Mastakovitch himself has said that\r\nwhat he likes particularly about your writing is its legibility. Why, it\r\nis all that Skoroplehin cares for, that writing should be good and\r\ndistinct like a copy, so as afterwards to pocket the paper and take it\r\nhome for his children to copy; he can't buy copybooks, the blockhead!\r\nYulian Mastakovitch is always saying, always insisting: 'Legible,\r\nlegible, legible!'... What is the matter? Vasya, I really don't know\r\nhow to talk to you ... it quite frightens me ... you crush me with your\r\ndepression.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all right, it's all right,\" said Vasya, and he fell back in his\r\nchair as though fainting. Arkady was alarmed.\r\n\r\n\"Will you have some water? Vasya! Vasya!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't, don't,\" said Vasya, pressing his hand. \"I am all right, I only\r\nfeel sad, I can't tell why. Better talk of something else; let me forget\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Calm yourself, for goodness' sake, calm yourself, Vasya. You will\r\nfinish it all right, on my honour, you will. And even if you don't\r\nfinish, what will it matter? You talk as though it were a crime!\"\r\n\r\n\"Arkady,\" said Vasya, looking at his friend with such meaning that\r\nArkady was quite frightened, for Vasya had never been so agitated\r\nbefore.... \"If I were alone, as I used to be.... No! I don't mean that.\r\nI keep wanting to tell you as a friend, to confide in you.... But why\r\nworry you, though?... You see, Arkady, to some much is given, others do\r\na little thing as I do. Well, if gratitude, appreciation, is expected of\r\nyou ... and you can't give it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Vasya, I don't understand you in the least.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have never been ungrateful,\" Vasya went on softly, as though speaking\r\nto himself, \"but if I am incapable of expressing all I feel, it seems as\r\nthough ... it seems, Arkady, as though I am really ungrateful, and\r\nthat's killing me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What next, what next! As though gratitude meant nothing more than your\r\nfinishing that copy in time? Just think what you are saying, Vasya? Is\r\nthat the whole expression of gratitude?\"\r\n\r\nVasya sank into silence at once, and looked open-eyed at Arkady, as\r\nthough his unexpected argument had settled all his doubts. He even\r\nsmiled, but the same melancholy expression came back to his face at\r\nonce. Arkady, taking this smile as a sign that all his uneasiness was\r\nover, and the look that succeeded it as an indication that he was\r\ndetermined to do better, was greatly relieved.\r\n\r\n\"Well, brother Arkasha, you will wake up,\" said Vasya, \"keep an eye on\r\nme; if I fall asleep it will be dreadful. I'll set to work now....\r\nArkasha?\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's nothing, I only ... I meant....\"\r\n\r\nVasya settled himself, and said no more, Arkady got into bed. Neither of\r\nthem said one word about their friends, the Artemyevs. Perhaps both of\r\nthem felt that they had been a little to blame, and that they ought not\r\nto have gone for their jaunt when they did. Arkady soon fell asleep,\r\nstill worried about Vasya. To his own surprise he woke up exactly at\r\neight o'clock in the morning. Vasya was asleep in his chair with the pen\r\nin his hand, pale and exhausted; the candle had burnt out. Mavra was\r\nbusy getting the samovar ready in the kitchen.\r\n\r\n\"Vasya, Vasya!\" Arkady cried in alarm, \"when did you fall asleep?\"\r\n\r\nVasya opened his eyes and jumped up from his chair.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" he cried, \"I must have fallen asleep....\"\r\n\r\nHe flew to the papers--everything was right; all were in order; there\r\nwas not a blot of ink, nor spot of grease from the candle on them.\r\n\r\n\"I think I must have fallen asleep about six o'clock,\" said Vasya. \"How\r\ncold it is in the night! Let us have tea, and I will go on again....\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you feel better?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, I'm all right, I'm all right now.\"\r\n\r\n\"A happy New Year to you, brother Vasya.\"\r\n\r\n\"And to you too, brother, the same to you, dear boy.\"\r\n\r\nThey embraced each other. Vasya's chin was quivering and his eyes were\r\nmoist. Arkady Ivanovitch was silent, he felt sad. They drank their tea\r\nhastily.\r\n\r\n\"Arkady, I've made up my mind, I am going myself to Yulian\r\nMastakovitch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, he wouldn't notice----\"\r\n\r\n\"But my conscience feels ill at ease, brother.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you know it's for his sake you are sitting here; it's for his sake\r\nyou are wearing yourself out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what, brother, I'll go round and see....\"\r\n\r\n\"Whom?\" asked Vasya.\r\n\r\n\"The Artemyevs. I'll take them your good wishes for the New Year as well\r\nas mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear fellow! Well, I'll stay here; and I see it's a good idea of\r\nyours; I shall be working here, I shan't waste my time. Wait one minute,\r\nI'll write a note.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, do brother, do, there's plenty of time. I've still to wash and\r\nshave and to brush my best coat. Well, Vasya, we are going to be\r\ncontented and happy. Embrace me, Vasya.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, if only we may, brother....\"\r\n\r\n\"Does Mr. Shumkov live here?\" they heard a child's voice on the stairs.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my dear, yes,\" said Mavra, showing the visitor in.\r\n\r\n\"What's that? What is it?\" cried Vasya, leaping up from the table and\r\nrushing to the entry, \"Petinka, you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, I have the honour to wish you a happy New Year, Vassily\r\nPetrovitch,\" said a pretty boy of ten years old with curly black hair.\r\n\"Sister sends you her love, and so does Mamma, and Sister told me to\r\ngive you a kiss for her.\"\r\n\r\nVasya caught the messenger up in the air and printed a long,\r\nenthusiastic kiss on his lips, which were very much like Lizanka's.\r\n\r\n\"Kiss him, Arkady,\" he said handing Petya to him, and without touching\r\nthe ground the boy was transferred to Arkady Ivanovitch's powerful and\r\neager arms.\r\n\r\n\"Will you have some breakfast, dear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank-you, very much. We have had it already, we got up early to-day,\r\nthe others have gone to church. Sister was two hours curling my hair,\r\nand pomading it, washing me and mending my trousers, for I tore them\r\nyesterday, playing with Sashka in the street, we were snowballing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, well!\"\r\n\r\n\"So she dressed me up to come and see you, and then pomaded my head and\r\nthen gave me a regular kissing. She said: 'Go to Vasya, wish him a happy\r\nNew Year, and ask whether they are happy, whether they had a good night,\r\nand ...' to ask something else,--oh yes! whether you had finished the\r\nwork you spoke of yesterday ... when you were there. Oh, I've got it all\r\nwritten down,\" said the boy, reading from a slip of paper which he took\r\nout of his pocket. \"Yes, they were uneasy.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be finished! It will be! Tell her that it will be. I shall\r\nfinish it, on my word of honour!\"\r\n\r\n\"And something else.... Oh yes, I forgot. Sister sent a little note and\r\na present, and I was forgetting it!...\"\r\n\r\n\"My goodness! Oh, you little darling! Where is it? where is it? That's\r\nit, oh! Look, brother, see what she writes. The dar--ling, the precious!\r\nYou know I saw there yesterday a paper-case for me; it's not finished,\r\nso she says, 'I am sending you a lock of my hair, and the other will\r\ncome later.' Look, brother, look!\"\r\n\r\nAnd overwhelmed with rapture he showed Arkady Ivanovitch a curl of\r\nluxuriant, jet-black hair; then he kissed it fervently and put it in his\r\nbreast pocket, nearest his heart.\r\n\r\n\"Vasya, I shall get you a locket for that curl,\" Arkady Ivanovitch said\r\nresolutely at last.\r\n\r\n\"And we are going to have hot veal, and to-morrow brains. Mamma wants to\r\nmake cakes ... but we are not going to have millet porridge,\" said the\r\nboy, after a moment's thought, to wind up his budget of interesting\r\nitems.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! what a pretty boy,\" cried Arkady Ivanovitch. \"Vasya, you are the\r\nhappiest of mortals.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy finished his tea, took from Vasya a note, a thousand kisses, and\r\nwent out happy and frolicsome as before.\r\n\r\n\"Well, brother,\" began Arkady Ivanovitch, highly delighted, \"you see how\r\nsplendid it all is; you see. Everything is going well, don't be\r\ndowncast, don't be uneasy. Go ahead! Get it done, Vasya, get it done.\r\nI'll be home at two o'clock. I'll go round to them, and then to Yulian\r\nMastakovitch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, good-bye, brother; good-bye.... Oh! if only.... Very good, you\r\ngo, very good,\" said Vasya, \"then I really won't go to Yulian\r\nMastakovitch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay, brother, stay, tell them ... well, whatever you think fit. Kiss\r\nher ... and give me a full account of everything afterwards.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, come--of course, I know all about it. This happiness has upset\r\nyou. The suddenness of it all; you've not been yourself since yesterday.\r\nYou have not got over the excitement of yesterday. Well, it's settled.\r\nNow try and get over it, Vasya. Good-bye, good-bye!\"\r\n\r\nAt last the friends parted. All the morning Arkady Ivanovitch was\r\npreoccupied, and could think of nothing but Vasya. He knew his weak,\r\nhighly nervous character. \"Yes, this happiness has upset him, I was\r\nright there,\" he said to himself. \"Upon my word, he has made me quite\r\ndepressed, too, that man will make a tragedy of anything! What a\r\nfeverish creature! Oh, I must save him! I must save him!\" said Arkady,\r\nnot noticing that he himself was exaggerating into something serious a\r\nslight trouble, in reality quite trivial. Only at eleven o'clock he\r\nreached the porter's lodge of Yulian Mastakovitch's house, to add his\r\nmodest name to the long list of illustrious persons who had written\r\ntheir names on a sheet of blotted and scribbled paper in the porter's\r\nlodge. What was his surprise when he saw just above his own the\r\nsignature of Vasya Shumkov! It amazed him. \"What's the matter with him?\"\r\nhe thought. Arkady Ivanovitch, who had just been so buoyant with hope,\r\ncame out feeling upset. There was certainly going to be trouble, but\r\nhow? And in what form?\r\n\r\nHe reached the Artemyevs with gloomy forebodings; he seemed\r\nabsent-minded from the first, and after talking a little with Lizanka\r\nwent away with tears in his eyes; he was really anxious about Vasya. He\r\nwent home running, and on the Neva came full tilt upon Vasya himself.\r\nThe latter, too, was uneasy.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going?\" cried Arkady Ivanovitch.\r\n\r\nVasya stopped as though he had been caught in a crime.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's nothing, brother, I wanted to go for a walk.\"\r\n\r\n\"You could not stand it, and have been to the Artemyevs? Oh, Vasya,\r\nVasya! Why did you go to Yulian Mastakovitch?\"\r\n\r\nVasya did not answer, but then with a wave of his hand, he said:\r\n\"Arkady, I don't know what is the matter with me. I....\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, come, Vasya. I know what it is. Calm yourself. You've been\r\nexcited, and overwrought ever since yesterday. Only think, it's not much\r\nto bear. Everybody's fond of you, everybody's ready to do anything for\r\nyou; your work is getting on all right; you will get it done, you will\r\ncertainly get it done. I know that you have been imagining something,\r\nyou have had apprehensions about something....\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it's all right, it's all right....\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you remember, Vasya, do you remember it was the same with you once\r\nbefore; do you remember, when you got your promotion, in your joy and\r\nthankfulness you were so zealous that you spoilt all your work for a\r\nweek? It is just the same with you now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, Arkady; but now it is different, it is not that at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is it different? And very likely the work is not urgent at all,\r\nwhile you are killing yourself....\"\r\n\r\n\"It's nothing, it's nothing. I am all right, it's nothing. Well, come\r\nalong!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, are you going home, and not to them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, brother, how could I have the face to turn up there?... I have\r\nchanged my mind. It was only that I could not stay on alone without you;\r\nnow you are coming back with me I'll sit down to write again. Let us\r\ngo!\"\r\n\r\nThey walked along and for some time were silent. Vasya was in haste.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you ask me about them?\" said Arkady Ivanovitch.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes! Well, Arkasha, what about them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Vasya, you are not like yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I am all right, I am all right. Tell me everything, Arkasha,\" said\r\nVasya, in an imploring voice, as though to avoid further explanations.\r\nArkady Ivanovitch sighed. He felt utterly at a loss, looking at Vasya.\r\n\r\nHis account of their friends roused Vasya. He even grew talkative. They\r\nhad dinner together. Lizanka's mother had filled Arkady Ivanovitch's\r\npockets with little cakes, and eating them the friends grew more\r\ncheerful. After dinner Vasya promised to take a nap, so as to sit up all\r\nnight. He did, in fact, lie down. In the morning, some one whom it was\r\nimpossible to refuse had invited Arkady Ivanovitch to tea. The friends\r\nparted. Arkady promised to come back as soon as he could, by eight\r\no'clock if possible. The three hours of separation seemed to him like\r\nthree years. At last he got away and rushed back to Vasya. When he went\r\ninto the room, he found it in darkness. Vasya was not at home. He asked\r\nMavra. Mavra said that he had been writing all the time, and had not\r\nslept at all, then he had paced up and down the room, and after that, an\r\nhour before, he had run out, saying he would be back in half-an-hour;\r\n\"and when, says he, Arkady Ivanovitch comes in, tell him, old woman,\r\nsays he,\" Mavra told him in conclusion, \"that I have gone out for a\r\nwalk,\" and he repeated the order three or four times.\r\n\r\n\"He is at the Artemyevs,\" thought Arkady Ivanovitch, and he shook his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nA minute later he jumped up with renewed hope.\r\n\r\n\"He has simply finished,\" he thought, \"that's all it is; he couldn't\r\nwait, but ran off there. But, no! he would have waited for me.... Let's\r\nhave a peep what he has there.\"\r\n\r\nHe lighted a candle, and ran to Vasya's writing-table: the work had made\r\nprogress and it looked as though there were not much left to do. Arkady\r\nIvanovitch was about to investigate further, when Vasya himself walked\r\nin....\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you are here?\" he cried, with a start of dismay.\r\n\r\nArkady Ivanovitch was silent. He was afraid to question Vasya. The\r\nlatter dropped his eyes and remained silent too, as he began sorting the\r\npapers. At last their eyes met. The look in Vasya's was so beseeching,\r\nimploring, and broken, that Arkady shuddered when he saw it. His heart\r\nquivered and was full.\r\n\r\n\"Vasya, my dear boy, what is it? What's wrong?\" he cried, rushing to him\r\nand squeezing him in his arms. \"Explain to me, I don't understand you,\r\nand your depression. What is the matter with you, my poor, tormented\r\nboy? What is it? Tell me all about it, without hiding anything. It can't\r\nbe only this----\"\r\n\r\nVasya held him tight and could say nothing. He could scarcely breathe.\r\n\r\n\"Don't, Vasya, don't! Well, if you don't finish it, what then? I don't\r\nunderstand you; tell me your trouble. You see it is for your sake I....\r\nOh dear! oh dear!\" he said, walking up and down the room and clutching\r\nat everything he came across, as though seeking at once some remedy for\r\nVasya. \"I will go to Yulian Mastakovitch instead of you to-morrow. I\r\nwill ask him--entreat him--to let you have another day. I will explain\r\nit all to him, anything, if it worries you so....\"\r\n\r\n\"God forbid!\" cried Vasya, and turned as white as the wall. He could\r\nscarcely stand on his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Vasya! Vasya!\"\r\n\r\nVasya pulled himself together. His lips were quivering; he tried to say\r\nsomething, but could only convulsively squeeze Arkady's hand in silence.\r\nHis hand was cold. Arkady stood facing him, full of anxious and\r\nmiserable suspense. Vasya raised his eyes again.\r\n\r\n\"Vasya, God bless you, Vasya! You wring my heart, my dear boy, my\r\nfriend.\"\r\n\r\nTears gushed from Vasya's eyes; he flung himself on Arkady's bosom.\r\n\r\n\"I have deceived you, Arkady,\" he said. \"I have deceived you. Forgive\r\nme, forgive me! I have been faithless to your friendship....\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Vasya? What is the matter?\" asked Arkady, in real alarm.\r\n\r\n\"Look!\"\r\n\r\nAnd with a gesture of despair Vasya tossed out of the drawer on to the\r\ntable six thick manuscripts, similar to the one he had copied.\r\n\r\n\"What's this?\"\r\n\r\n\"What I have to get through by the day after to-morrow. I haven't done a\r\nquarter! Don't ask me, don't ask me how it has happened,\" Vasya went on,\r\nspeaking at once of what was distressing him so terribly. \"Arkady, dear\r\nfriend, I don't know myself what came over me. I feel as though I were\r\ncoming out of a dream. I have wasted three weeks doing nothing. I kept\r\n... I ... kept going to see her.... My heart was aching, I was tormented\r\nby ... the uncertainty ... I could not write. I did not even think about\r\nit. Only now, when happiness is at hand for me, I have come to my\r\nsenses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Vasya,\" began Arkady Ivanovitch resolutely, \"Vasya, I will save you. I\r\nunderstand it all. It's a serious matter; I will save you. Listen!\r\nlisten to me: I will go to Yulian Mastakovitch to-morrow.... Don't shake\r\nyour head; no, listen! I will tell him exactly how it has all been; let\r\nme do that ... I will explain to him.... I will go into everything. I\r\nwill tell him how crushed you are, how you are worrying yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know that you are killing me now?\" Vasya brought out, turning\r\ncold with horror.\r\n\r\nArkady Ivanovitch turned pale, but at once controlling himself, laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Is that all? Is that all?\" he said. \"Upon my word, Vasya, upon my word!\r\nAren't you ashamed? Come, listen! I see that I am grieving you. You see\r\nI understand you; I know what is passing in your heart. Why, we have\r\nbeen living together for five years, thank God! You are such a kind,\r\nsoft-hearted fellow, but weak, unpardonably weak. Why, even Lizaveta\r\nMikalovna has noticed it. And you are a dreamer, and that's a bad thing,\r\ntoo; you may go from bad to worse, brother. I tell you, I know what you\r\nwant! You would like Yulian Mastakovitch, for instance, to be beside\r\nhimself and, maybe, to give a ball, too, from joy, because you are going\r\nto get married.... Stop, stop! you are frowning. You see that at one\r\nword from me you are offended on Yulian Mastakovitch's account. I'll let\r\nhim alone. You know I respect him just as much as you do. But argue as\r\nyou may, you can't prevent my thinking that you would like there to be\r\nno one unhappy in the whole world when you are getting married.... Yes,\r\nbrother, you must admit that you would like me, for instance, your best\r\nfriend, to come in for a fortune of a hundred thousand all of a sudden,\r\nyou would like all the enemies in the world to be suddenly, for no rhyme\r\nor reason, reconciled, so that in their joy they might all embrace one\r\nanother in the middle of the street, and then, perhaps, come here to\r\ncall on you. Vasya, my dear boy, I am not laughing; it is true; you've\r\nsaid as much to me long ago, in different ways. Because you are happy,\r\nyou want every one, absolutely every one, to become happy at once. It\r\nhurts you and troubles you to be happy alone. And so you want at once to\r\ndo your utmost to be worthy of that happiness, and maybe to do some\r\ngreat deed to satisfy your conscience. Oh! I understand how ready you\r\nare to distress yourself for having suddenly been remiss just where you\r\nought to have shown your zeal, your capacity ... well, maybe your\r\ngratitude, as you say. It is very bitter for you to think that Yulian\r\nMastakovitch may frown and even be angry when he sees that you have not\r\njustified the expectations he had of you. It hurts you to think that you\r\nmay hear reproaches from the man you look upon as your benefactor--and\r\nat such a moment! when your heart is full of joy and you don't know on\r\nwhom to lavish your gratitude.... Isn't that true? It is, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\nArkady Ivanovitch, whose voice was trembling, paused, and drew a deep\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\nVasya looked affectionately at his friend. A smile passed over his lips.\r\nHis face even lighted up, as though with a gleam of hope.\r\n\r\n\"Well, listen, then,\" Arkady Ivanovitch began again, growing more\r\nhopeful, \"there's no necessity that you should forfeit Yulian\r\nMastakovitch's favour.... Is there, dear boy? Is there any question of\r\nit? And since it is so,\" said Arkady, jumping up, \"I shall sacrifice\r\nmyself for you. I am going to-morrow to Yulian Mastakovitch, and don't\r\noppose me. You magnify your failure to a crime, Vasya. Yulian\r\nMastakovitch is magnanimous and merciful, and, what is more, he is not\r\nlike you. He will listen to you and me, and get us out of our trouble,\r\nbrother Vasya. Well, are you calmer?\"\r\n\r\nVasya pressed his friend's hands with tears in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Hush, hush, Arkady,\" he said, \"the thing is settled. I haven't\r\nfinished, so very well; if I haven't finished, I haven't finished, and\r\nthere's no need for you to go. I will tell him all about it, I will go\r\nmyself. I am calmer now, I am perfectly calm; only you mustn't go....\r\nBut listen....\"\r\n\r\n\"Vasya, my dear boy,\" Arkady Ivanovitch cried joyfully, \"I judged from\r\nwhat you said. I am glad that you have thought better of things and have\r\nrecovered yourself. But whatever may befall you, whatever happens, I am\r\nwith you, remember that. I see that it worries you to think of my\r\nspeaking to Yulian Mastakovitch--and I won't say a word, not a word, you\r\nshall tell him yourself. You see, you shall go to-morrow.... Oh no, you\r\nhad better not go, you'll go on writing here, you see, and I'll find out\r\nabout this work, whether it is very urgent or not, whether it must be\r\ndone by the time or not, and if you don't finish it in time what will\r\ncome of it. Then I will run back to you. Do you see, do you see! There\r\nis still hope; suppose the work is not urgent--it may be all right.\r\nYulian Mastakovitch may not remember, then all is saved.\"\r\n\r\nVasya shook his head doubtfully. But his grateful eyes never left his\r\nfriend's face.\r\n\r\n\"Come, that's enough, I am so weak, so tired,\" he said, sighing. \"I\r\ndon't want to think about it. Let us talk of something else. I won't\r\nwrite either now; do you know I'll only finish two short pages just to\r\nget to the end of a passage. Listen ... I have long wanted to ask you,\r\nhow is it you know me so well?\"\r\n\r\nTears dropped from Vasya's eyes on Arkady's hand.\r\n\r\n\"If you knew, Vasya, how fond I am of you, you would not ask that--yes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, Arkady, I don't know that, because I don't know why you are\r\nso fond of me. Yes, Arkady, do you know, even your love has been killing\r\nme? Do you know, ever so many times, particularly when I am thinking of\r\nyou in bed (for I always think of you when I am falling asleep), I shed\r\ntears, and my heart throbs at the thought ... at the thought.... Well,\r\nat the thought that you are so fond of me, while I can do nothing to\r\nrelieve my heart, can do nothing to repay you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see, Vasya, you see what a fellow you are! Why, how upset you are\r\nnow,\" said Arkady, whose heart ached at that moment and who remembered\r\nthe scene in the street the day before.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense, you want me to be calm, but I never have been so calm and\r\nhappy! Do you know.... Listen, I want to tell you all about it, but I am\r\nafraid of wounding you.... You keep scolding me and being vexed; and I\r\nam afraid.... See how I am trembling now, I don't know why. You see,\r\nthis is what I want to say. I feel as though I had never known myself\r\nbefore--yes! Yes, I only began to understand other people too,\r\nyesterday. I did not feel or appreciate things fully, brother. My heart\r\n... was hard.... Listen how has it happened, that I have never done good\r\nto any one, any one in the world, because I couldn't--I am not even\r\npleasant to look at.... But everybody does me good! You, to begin with:\r\ndo you suppose I don't see that? Only I said nothing; only I said\r\nnothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, Vasya!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Arkasha! ... it's all right,\" Vasya interrupted, hardly able to\r\narticulate for tears. \"I talked to you yesterday about Yulian\r\nMastakovitch. And you know yourself how stern and severe he is, even you\r\nhave come in for a reprimand from him; yet he deigned to jest with me\r\nyesterday, to show his affection, and kind-heartedness, which he\r\nprudently conceals from every one....\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, Vasya, that only shows you deserve your good fortune.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Arkasha! How I longed to finish all this.... No, I shall ruin my\r\ngood luck! I feel that! Oh no, not through that,\" Vasya added, seeing\r\nthat Arkady glanced at the heap of urgent work lying on the table,\r\n\"that's nothing, that's only paper covered with writing ... it's\r\nnonsense! That matter's settled.... I went to see them to-day, Arkasha;\r\nI did not go in. I felt depressed and sad. I simply stood at the door.\r\nShe was playing the piano, I listened. You see, Arkady,\" he went on,\r\ndropping his voice, \"I did not dare to go in.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, Vasya--what is the matter with you? You look at one so\r\nstrangely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's nothing, I feel a little sick; my legs are trembling; it's\r\nbecause I sat up last night. Yes! Everything looks green before my eyes.\r\nIt's here, here----\"\r\n\r\nHe pointed to his heart. He fainted. When he came to himself Arkady\r\ntried to take forcible measures. He tried to compel him to go to bed.\r\nNothing would induce Vasya to consent. He shed tears, wrung his hands,\r\nwanted to write, was absolutely set on finishing his two pages. To avoid\r\nexciting him Arkady let him sit down to the work.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know,\" said Vasya, as he settled himself in his place, \"an idea\r\nhas occurred to me? There is hope.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled to Arkady, and his pale face lighted up with a gleam of hope.\r\n\r\n\"I will take him what is done the day after to-morrow. About the rest I\r\nwill tell a lie. I will say it has been burnt, that it has been sopped\r\nin water, that I have lost it.... That, in fact, I have not finished it;\r\nI cannot lie. I will explain, do you know, what? I'll explain to him all\r\nabout it. I will tell him how it was that I could not. I'll tell him\r\nabout my love; he has got married himself just lately, he'll understand\r\nme. I will do it all, of course, respectfully, quietly; he will see my\r\ntears and be touched by them....\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of course, you must go, you must go and explain to him.... But\r\nthere's no need of tears! Tears for what? Really, Vasya, you quite scare\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'll go, I'll go. But now let me write, let me write, Arkasha. I\r\nam not interfering with any one, let me write!\"\r\n\r\nArkady flung himself on the bed. He had no confidence in Vasya, no\r\nconfidence at all. \"Vasya was capable of anything, but to ask\r\nforgiveness for what? how? That was not the point. The point was, that\r\nVasya had not carried out his obligations, that Vasya felt guilty _in\r\nhis own eyes_, felt that he was ungrateful to destiny, that Vasya was\r\ncrushed, overwhelmed by happiness and thought himself unworthy of it;\r\nthat, in fact, he was simply trying to find an excuse to go off his head\r\non that point, and that he had not recovered from the unexpectedness of\r\nwhat had happened the day before; that's what it is,\" thought Arkady\r\nIvanovitch. \"I must save him. I must reconcile him to himself. He will\r\nbe his own ruin.\" He thought and thought, and resolved to go at once\r\nnext day to Yulian Mastakovitch, and to tell him all about it.\r\n\r\nVasya was sitting writing. Arkady Ivanovitch, worn out, lay down to\r\nthink things over again, and only woke at daybreak.\r\n\r\n\"Damnation! Again!\" he cried, looking at Vasya; the latter was still\r\nsitting writing.\r\n\r\nArkady rushed up to him, seized him and forcibly put him to bed. Vasya\r\nwas smiling: his eyes were closing with sleep. He could hardly speak.\r\n\r\n\"I wanted to go to bed,\" he said. \"Do you know, Arkady, I have an idea;\r\nI shall finish. I made my pen go faster! I could not have sat at it any\r\nlonger; wake me at eight o'clock.\"\r\n\r\nWithout finishing his sentence, he dropped asleep and slept like the\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n\"Mavra,\" said Arkady Ivanovitch to Mavra, who came in with the tea, \"he\r\nasked to be waked in an hour. Don't wake him on any account! Let him\r\nsleep ten hours, if he can. Do you understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't get the dinner, don't bring in the wood, don't make a noise or it\r\nwill be the worse for you. If he asks for me, tell him I have gone to\r\nthe office--do you understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand, bless you, sir; let him sleep and welcome! I am glad my\r\ngentlemen should sleep well, and I take good care of their things. And\r\nabout that cup that was broken, and you blamed me, your honour, it\r\nwasn't me, it was poor pussy broke it, I ought to have kept an eye on\r\nher. 'S-sh, you confounded thing,' I said.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, be quiet, be quiet!\"\r\n\r\nArkady Ivanovitch followed Mavra out into the kitchen, asked for the key\r\nand locked her up there. Then he went to the office. On the way he\r\nconsidered how he could present himself before Yulian Mastakovitch, and\r\nwhether it would be appropriate and not impertinent. He went into the\r\noffice timidly, and timidly inquired whether His Excellency were there;\r\nreceiving the answer that he was not and would not be, Arkady Ivanovitch\r\ninstantly thought of going to his flat, but reflected very prudently\r\nthat if Yulian Mastakovitch had not come to the office he would\r\ncertainly be busy at home. He remained. The hours seemed to him endless.\r\nIndirectly he inquired about the work entrusted to Shumkov, but no one\r\nknew anything about this. All that was known was that Yulian\r\nMastakovitch did employ him on special jobs, but what they were--no one\r\ncould say. At last it struck three o'clock, and Arkady Ivanovitch rushed\r\nout, eager to get home. In the vestibule he was met by a clerk, who told\r\nhim that Vassily Petrovitch Shumkov had come about one o'clock and\r\nasked, the clerk added, \"whether you were here, and whether Yulian\r\nMastakovitch had been here.\" Hearing this Arkady Ivanovitch took a\r\nsledge and hastened home beside himself with alarm.\r\n\r\nShumkov was at home. He was walking about the room in violent\r\nexcitement. Glancing at Arkady Ivanovitch, he immediately controlled\r\nhimself, reflected, and hastened to conceal his emotion. He sat down to\r\nhis papers without a word. He seemed to avoid his friend's questions,\r\nseemed to be bothered by them, to be pondering to himself on some plan,\r\nand deciding to conceal his decision, because he could not reckon\r\nfurther on his friend's affection. This struck Arkady, and his heart\r\nached with a poignant and oppressive pain. He sat on the bed and began\r\nturning over the leaves of some book, the only one he had in his\r\npossession, keeping his eye on poor Vasya. But Vasya remained\r\nobstinately silent, writing, and not raising his head. So passed several\r\nhours, and Arkady's misery reached an extreme point. At last, at eleven\r\no'clock, Vasya lifted his head and looked with a fixed, vacant stare at\r\nArkady. Arkady waited. Two or three minutes passed; Vasya did not speak.\r\n\r\n\"Vasya!\" cried Arkady.\r\n\r\nVasya made no answer.\r\n\r\n\"Vasya!\" he repeated, jumping up from the bed, \"Vasya, what is the\r\nmatter with you? What is it?\" he cried, running up to him.\r\n\r\nVasya raised his eyes and again looked at him with the same vacant,\r\nfixed stare.\r\n\r\n\"He's in a trance!\" thought Arkady, trembling all over with fear. He\r\nseized a bottle of water, raised Vasya, poured some water on his head,\r\nmoistened his temples, rubbed his hands in his own--and Vasya came to\r\nhimself. \"Vasya, Vasya!\" cried Arkady, unable to restrain his tears.\r\n\"Vasya, save yourself, rouse yourself, rouse yourself!...\" He could say\r\nno more, but held him tight in his arms. A look as of some oppressive\r\nsensation passed over Vasya's face; he rubbed his forehead and clutched\r\nat his head, as though he were afraid it would burst.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what is the matter with me,\" he added, at last. \"I feel\r\ntorn to pieces. Come, it's all right, it's all right! Give over, Arkady;\r\ndon't grieve,\" he repeated, looking at him with sad, exhausted eyes.\r\n\"Why be so anxious? Come!\"\r\n\r\n\"You, you comforting me!\" cried Arkady, whose heart was torn. \"Vasya,\"\r\nhe said at last, \"lie down and have a little nap, won't you? Don't wear\r\nyourself out for nothing! You'll set to work better afterwards.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Vasya, \"by all means, I'll lie down, very good. Yes!\r\nyou see I meant to finish, but now I've changed my mind, yes....\"\r\n\r\nAnd Arkady led him to the bed.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Vasya,\" he said firmly, \"we must settle this matter finally.\r\nTell me what were you thinking about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said Vasya, with a flourish of his weak hand turning over on the\r\nother side.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Vasya, come, make up your mind. I don't want to hurt you. I can't\r\nbe silent any longer. You won't sleep till you've made up your mind, I\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\n\"As you like, as you like,\" Vasya repeated enigmatically.\r\n\r\n\"He will give in,\" thought Arkady Ivanovitch.\r\n\r\n\"Attend to me, Vasya,\" he said, \"remember what I say, and I will save\r\nyou to-morrow; to-morrow I will decide your fate! What am I saying, your\r\nfate? You have so frightened me, Vasya, that I am using your own words.\r\nFate, indeed! It's simply nonsense, rubbish! You don't want to lose\r\nYulian Mastakovitch's favour--affection, if you like. No! And you won't\r\nlose it, you will see. I----\"\r\n\r\nArkady Ivanovitch would have said more, but Vasya interrupted him. He\r\nsat up in bed, put both arms round Arkady Ivanovitch's neck and kissed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Enough,\" he said in a weak voice, \"enough! Say no more about that!\"\r\n\r\nAnd again he turned his face to the wall.\r\n\r\n\"My goodness!\" thought Arkady, \"my goodness! What is the matter with\r\nhim? He is utterly lost. What has he in his mind! He will be his own\r\nundoing.\"\r\n\r\nArkady looked at him in despair.\r\n\r\n\"If he were to fall ill,\" thought Arkady, \"perhaps it would be better.\r\nHis trouble would pass off with illness, and that might be the best way\r\nof settling the whole business. But what nonsense I am talking. Oh, my\r\nGod!\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Vasya seemed to be asleep. Arkady Ivanovitch was relieved. \"A\r\ngood sign,\" he thought. He made up his mind to sit beside him all night.\r\nBut Vasya was restless; he kept twitching and tossing about on the bed,\r\nand opening his eyes for an instant. At last exhaustion got the upper\r\nhand, he slept like the dead. It was about two o'clock in the morning,\r\nArkady Ivanovitch began to doze in the chair with his elbow on the\r\ntable!\r\n\r\nHe had a strange and agitated dream. He kept fancying that he was not\r\nasleep, and that Vasya was still lying on the bed. But strange to say,\r\nhe fancied that Vasya was pretending, that he was deceiving him, that he\r\nwas getting up, stealthily watching him out of the corner of his eye,\r\nand was stealing up to the writing table. Arkady felt a scalding pain at\r\nhis heart; he felt vexed and sad and oppressed to see Vasya not trusting\r\nhim, hiding and concealing himself from him. He tried to catch hold of\r\nhim, to call out, to carry him to the bed. Then Vasya kept shrieking in\r\nhis arms, and he laid on the bed a lifeless corpse. He opened his eyes\r\nand woke up; Vasya was sitting before him at the table, writing.\r\n\r\nHardly able to believe his senses, Arkady glanced at the bed; Vasya was\r\nnot there. Arkady jumped up in a panic, still under the influence of his\r\ndream. Vasya did not stir; he went on writing. All at once Arkady\r\nnoticed with horror that Vasya was moving a dry pen over the paper, was\r\nturning over perfectly blank pages, and hurrying, hurrying to fill up\r\nthe paper as though he were doing his work in a most thorough and\r\nefficient way. \"No, this is not a trance,\" thought Arkady Ivanovitch,\r\nand he trembled all over.\r\n\r\n\"Vasya, Vasya, speak to me,\" he cried, clutching him by the shoulder.\r\nBut Vasya did not speak; he went on as before, scribbling with a dry pen\r\nover the paper.\r\n\r\n\"At last I have made the pen go faster,\" he said, without looking up at\r\nArkady.\r\n\r\nArkady seized his hand and snatched away the pen.\r\n\r\nA moan broke from Vasya. He dropped his hand and raised his eyes to\r\nArkady; then with an air of misery and exhaustion he passed his hand\r\nover his forehead as though he wanted to shake off some leaden weight\r\nthat was pressing upon his whole being, and slowly, as though lost in\r\nthought, he let his head sink on his breast.\r\n\r\n\"Vasya, Vasya!\" cried Arkady in despair. \"Vasya!\"\r\n\r\nA minute later Vasya looked at him, tears stood in his large blue eyes,\r\nand his pale, mild face wore a look of infinite suffering. He whispered\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\n\"What, what is it?\" cried Arkady, bending down to him.\r\n\r\n\"What for, why are they doing it to me?\" whispered Vasya. \"What for?\r\nWhat have I done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Vasya, what is it? What are you afraid of? What is it?\" cried Arkady,\r\nwringing his hands in despair.\r\n\r\n\"Why are they sending me for a soldier?\" said Vasya, looking his friend\r\nstraight in the face. \"Why is it? What have I done?\"\r\n\r\nArkady's hair stood on end with horror; he refused to believe his ears.\r\nHe stood over him, half dead.\r\n\r\nA minute later he pulled himself together. \"It's nothing, it's only for\r\nthe minute,\" he said to himself, with pale face and blue, quivering\r\nlips, and he hastened to put on his outdoor things. He meant to run\r\nstraight for a doctor. All at once Vasya called to him. Arkady rushed to\r\nhim and clasped him in his arms like a mother whose child is being torn\r\nfrom her.\r\n\r\n\"Arkady, Arkady, don't tell any one! Don't tell any one, do you hear? It\r\nis my trouble, I must bear it alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it--what is it? Rouse yourself, Vasya, rouse yourself!\"\r\n\r\nVasya sighed, and slow tears trickled down his cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"Why kill her? How is she to blame?\" he muttered in an agonized,\r\nheartrending voice. \"The sin is mine, the sin is mine!\"\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Farewell, my love! Farewell, my love!\" he whispered, shaking his\r\nluckless head. Arkady started, pulled himself together and would have\r\nrushed for the doctor. \"Let us go, it is time,\" cried Vasya, carried\r\naway by Arkady's last movement. \"Let us go, brother, let us go; I am\r\nready. You lead the way.\" He paused and looked at Arkady with a downcast\r\nand mistrustful face.\r\n\r\n\"Vasya, for goodness' sake, don't follow me! Wait for me here. I will\r\ncome back to you directly, directly,\" said Arkady Ivanovitch, losing his\r\nhead and snatching up his cap to run for a doctor. Vasya sat down at\r\nonce, he was quiet and docile; but there was a gleam of some desperate\r\nresolution in his eye. Arkady turned back, snatched up from the table an\r\nopen penknife, looked at the poor fellow for the last time, and ran out\r\nof the flat.\r\n\r\nIt was eight o'clock. It had been broad daylight for some time in the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nHe found no one. He was running about for a full hour. All the doctors\r\nwhose addresses he had got from the house porter when he inquired of the\r\nlatter whether there were no doctor living in the building, had gone\r\nout, either to their work or on their private affairs. There was one who\r\nsaw patients. This one questioned at length and in detail the servant\r\nwho announced that Nefedevitch had called, asking him who it was, from\r\nwhom he came, what was the matter, and concluded by saying that he could\r\nnot go, that he had a great deal to do, and that patients of that kind\r\nought to be taken to a hospital.\r\n\r\nThen Arkady, exhausted, agitated, and utterly taken aback by this turn\r\nof affairs, cursed all the doctors on earth, and rushed home in the\r\nutmost alarm about Vasya. He ran into the flat. Mavra, as though there\r\nwere nothing the matter, went on scrubbing the floor, breaking up wood\r\nand preparing to light the stove. He went into the room; there was no\r\ntrace of Vasya, he had gone out.\r\n\r\n\"Which way? Where? Where will the poor fellow be off to?\" thought\r\nArkady, frozen with terror. He began questioning Mavra. She knew\r\nnothing, had neither seen nor heard him go out, God bless him!\r\nNefedevitch rushed off to the Artemyevs'.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to him for some reason that he must be there.\r\n\r\nIt was ten o'clock by the time he arrived. They did not expect him, knew\r\nnothing and had heard nothing. He stood before them frightened,\r\ndistressed, and asked where was Vasya? The mother's legs gave way under\r\nher; she sank back on the sofa. Lizanka, trembling with alarm, began\r\nasking what had happened. What could he say? Arkady Ivanovitch got out\r\nof it as best he could, invented some tale which of course was not\r\nbelieved, and fled, leaving them distressed and anxious. He flew to his\r\ndepartment that he might not be too late there, and he let them know\r\nthat steps might be taken at once. On the way it occurred to him that\r\nVasya would be at Yulian Mastakovitch's. That was more likely than\r\nanything: Arkady had thought of that first of all, even before the\r\nArtemyevs'. As he drove by His Excellency's door, he thought of\r\nstopping, but at once told the driver to go straight on. He made up his\r\nmind to try and find out whether anything had happened at the office,\r\nand if he were not there to go to His Excellency, ostensibly to report\r\non Vasya. Some one must be informed of it.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he got into the waiting-room he was surrounded by\r\nfellow-clerks, for the most part young men of his own standing in the\r\nservice. With one voice they began asking him what had happened to\r\nVasya? At the same time they all told him that Vasya had gone out of his\r\nmind, and thought that he was to be sent for a soldier as a punishment\r\nfor having neglected his work. Arkady Ivanovitch, answering them in all\r\ndirections, or rather avoiding giving a direct answer to any one, rushed\r\ninto the inner room. On the way he learned that Vasya was in Yulian\r\nMastakovitch's private room, that every one had been there and that\r\nEsper Ivanovitch had gone in there too. He was stopped on the way. One\r\nof the senior clerks asked him who he was and what he wanted? Without\r\ndistinguishing the person he said something about Vasya and went\r\nstraight into the room. He heard Yulian Mastakovitch's voice from\r\nwithin. \"Where are you going?\" some one asked him at the very door.\r\nArkady Ivanovitch was almost in despair; he was on the point of turning\r\nback, but through the open door he saw his poor Vasya. He pushed the\r\ndoor and squeezed his way into the room. Every one seemed to be in\r\nconfusion and perplexity, because Yulian Mastakovitch was apparently\r\nmuch chagrined. All the more important personages were standing about\r\nhim talking, and coming to no decision. At a little distance stood\r\nVasya. Arkady's heart sank when he looked at him. Vasya was standing,\r\npale, with his head up, stiffly erect, like a recruit before a new\r\nofficer, with his feet together and his hands held rigidly at his sides.\r\nHe was looking Yulian Mastakovitch straight in the face. Arkady was\r\nnoticed at once, and some one who knew that they lodged together\r\nmentioned the fact to His Excellency. Arkady was led up to him. He tried\r\nto make some answer to the questions put to him, glanced at Yulian\r\nMastakovitch and seeing on his face a look of genuine compassion, began\r\ntrembling and sobbing like a child. He even did more, he snatched His\r\nExcellency's hand and held it to his eyes, wetting it with his tears, so\r\nthat Yulian Mastakovitch was obliged to draw it hastily away, and waving\r\nit in the air, said, \"Come, my dear fellow, come! I see you have a good\r\nheart.\" Arkady sobbed and turned an imploring look on every one. It\r\nseemed to him that they were all brothers of his dear Vasya, that they\r\nwere all worried and weeping about him. \"How, how has it happened? how\r\nhas it happened?\" asked Yulian Mastakovitch. \"What has sent him out of\r\nhis mind?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gra--gra--gratitude!\" was all Arkady Ivanovitch could articulate.\r\n\r\nEvery one heard his answer with amazement, and it seemed strange and\r\nincredible to every one that a man could go out of his mind from\r\ngratitude. Arkady explained as best he could.\r\n\r\n\"Good Heavens! what a pity!\" said Yulian Mastakovitch at last. \"And the\r\nwork entrusted to him was not important, and not urgent in the least. It\r\nwas not worth while for a man to kill himself over it! Well, take him\r\naway!\"... At this point Yulian Mastakovitch turned to Arkady Ivanovitch\r\nagain, and began questioning him once more. \"He begs,\" he said, pointing\r\nto Vasya, \"that some girl should not be told of this. Who is she--his\r\nbetrothed, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\nArkady began to explain. Meanwhile Vasya seemed to be thinking of\r\nsomething, as though he were straining his memory to the utmost to\r\nrecall some important, necessary matter, which was particularly wanted\r\nat this moment. From time to time he looked round with a distressed\r\nface, as though hoping some one would remind him of what he had\r\nforgotten. He fastened his eyes on Arkady. All of a sudden there was a\r\ngleam of hope in his eyes; he moved with the left leg forward, took\r\nthree steps as smartly as he could, clicking with his right boot as\r\nsoldiers do when they move forward at the call from their officer. Every\r\none was waiting to see what would happen.\r\n\r\n\"I have a physical defect and am small and weak, and I am not fit for\r\nmilitary service, Your Excellency,\" he said abruptly.\r\n\r\nAt that every one in the room felt a pang at his heart, and firm as was\r\nYulian Mastakovitch's character, tears trickled from his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Take him away,\" he said, with a wave of his hands.\r\n\r\n\"Present!\" said Vasya in an undertone; he wheeled round to the left and\r\nmarched out of the room. All who were interested in his fate followed\r\nhim out. Arkady pushed his way out behind the others. They made Vasya\r\nsit down in the waiting-room till the carriage came which had been\r\nordered to take him to the hospital. He sat down in silence and seemed\r\nin great anxiety. He nodded to any one he recognized as though saying\r\ngood-bye. He looked round towards the door every minute, and prepared\r\nhimself to set off when he should be told it was time. People crowded in\r\na close circle round him; they were all shaking their heads and\r\nlamenting. Many of them were much impressed by his story, which had\r\nsuddenly become known. Some discussed his illness, while others\r\nexpressed their pity and high opinion of Vasya, saying that he was such\r\na quiet, modest young man, that he had been so promising; people\r\ndescribed what efforts he had made to learn, how eager he was for\r\nknowledge, how he had worked to educate himself. \"He had risen by his\r\nown efforts from a humble position,\" some one observed. They spoke with\r\nemotion of His Excellency's affection for him. Some of them fell to\r\nexplaining why Vasya was possessed by the idea that he was being sent\r\nfor a soldier, because he had not finished his work. They said that the\r\npoor fellow had so lately belonged to the class liable for military\r\nservice and had only received his first grade through the good offices\r\nof Yulian Mastakovitch, who had had the cleverness to discover his\r\ntalent, his docility, and the rare mildness of his disposition. In fact,\r\nthere was a great number of views and theories.\r\n\r\nA very short fellow-clerk of Vasya's was conspicuous as being\r\nparticularly distressed. He was not very young, probably about thirty.\r\nHe was pale as a sheet, trembling all over and smiling queerly, perhaps\r\nbecause any scandalous affair or terrible scene both frightens, and at\r\nthe same time somewhat rejoices the outside spectator. He kept running\r\nround the circle that surrounded Vasya, and as he was so short, stood on\r\ntiptoe and caught at the button of every one--that is, of those with\r\nwhom he felt entitled to take such a liberty--and kept saying that he\r\nknew how it had all happened, that it was not so simple, but a very\r\nimportant matter, that it couldn't be left without further inquiry; then\r\nstood on tiptoe again, whispered in some one's ear, nodded his head\r\nagain two or three times, and ran round again. At last everything was\r\nover. The porter made his appearance, and an attendant from the hospital\r\nwent up to Vasya and told him it was time to start. Vasya jumped up in a\r\nflutter and went with them, looking about him. He was looking about for\r\nsome one.\r\n\r\n\"Vasya, Vasya!\" cried Arkady Ivanovitch, sobbing. Vasya stopped, and\r\nArkady squeezed his way up to him. They flung themselves into each\r\nother's arms in a last bitter embrace. It was sad to see them. What\r\nmonstrous calamity was wringing the tears from their eyes! What were\r\nthey weeping for? What was their trouble? Why did they not understand\r\none another?\r\n\r\n\"Here, here, take it! Take care of it,\" said Shumkov, thrusting a paper\r\nof some kind into Arkady's hand. \"They will take it away from me. Bring\r\nit me later on; bring it ... take care of it....\" Vasya could not\r\nfinish, they called to him. He ran hurriedly downstairs, nodding to\r\nevery one, saying good-bye to every one. There was despair in his face.\r\nAt last he was put in the carriage and taken away. Arkady made haste to\r\nopen the paper: it was Liza's curl of black hair, from which Vasya had\r\nnever parted. Hot tears gushed from Arkady's eyes: oh, poor Liza!\r\n\r\nWhen office hours were over, he went to the Artemyevs'. There is no need\r\nto describe what happened there! Even Petya, little Petya, though he\r\ncould not quite understand what had happened to dear Vasya, went into a\r\ncorner, hid his face in his little hands, and sobbed in the fullness of\r\nhis childish heart. It was quite dusk when Arkady returned home. When he\r\nreached the Neva he stood still for a minute and turned a keen glance up\r\nthe river into the smoky frozen thickness of the distance, which was\r\nsuddenly flushed crimson with the last purple and blood-red glow of\r\nsunset, still smouldering on the misty horizon.... Night lay over the\r\ncity, and the wide plain of the Neva, swollen with frozen snow, was\r\nshining in the last gleams of the sun with myriads of sparks of gleaming\r\nhoar frost. There was a frost of twenty degrees. A cloud of frozen steam\r\nhung about the overdriven horses and the hurrying people. The condensed\r\natmosphere quivered at the slightest sound, and from all the roofs on\r\nboth sides of the river, columns of smoke rose up like giants and\r\nfloated across the cold sky, intertwining and untwining as they went, so\r\nthat it seemed new buildings were rising up above the old, a new town\r\nwas taking shape in the air.... It seemed as if all that world, with all\r\nits inhabitants, strong and weak, with all their habitations, the\r\nrefuges of the poor, or the gilded palaces for the comfort of the\r\npowerful of this world was at that twilight hour like a fantastic vision\r\nof fairy-land, like a dream which in its turn would vanish and pass away\r\nlike vapour into the dark blue sky. A strange thought came to poor\r\nVasya's forlorn friend. He started, and his heart seemed at that instant\r\nflooded with a hot rush of blood kindled by a powerful, overwhelming\r\nsensation he had never known before. He seemed only now to understand\r\nall the trouble, and to know why his poor Vasya had gone out of his\r\nmind, unable to bear his happiness. His lips twitched, his eyes lighted\r\nup, he turned pale, and as it were had a clear vision into something\r\nnew.\r\n\r\nHe became gloomy and depressed, and lost all his gaiety. His old lodging\r\ngrew hateful to him--he took a new room. He did not care to visit the\r\nArtemyevs, and indeed he could not. Two years later he met Lizanka in\r\nchurch. She was by then married; beside her walked a wet nurse with a\r\ntiny baby. They greeted each other, and for a long time avoided all\r\nmention of the past. Liza said that, thank God, she was happy, that she\r\nwas not badly off, that her husband was a kind man and that she was fond\r\nof him.... But suddenly in the middle of a sentence her eyes filled with\r\ntears, her voice failed, she turned away, and bowed down to the church\r\npavement to hide her grief.\r\n\nA CHRISTMAS TREE AND A WEDDING\r\n\r\nA STORY\r\n\nThe other day I saw a wedding ... but no, I had better tell you about\r\nthe Christmas tree. The wedding was nice, I liked it very much; but the\r\nother incident was better. I don't know how it was that, looking at that\r\nwedding, I thought of that Christmas tree. This was what happened. Just\r\nfive years ago, on New Year's Eve, I was invited to a children's party.\r\nThe giver of the party was a well-known and business-like personage,\r\nwith connections, with a large circle of acquaintances, and a good many\r\nschemes on hand, so that it may be supposed that this party was an\r\nexcuse for getting the parents together and discussing various\r\ninteresting matters in an innocent, casual way. I was an outsider; I had\r\nno interesting matter to contribute, and so I spent the evening rather\r\nindependently. There was another gentleman present who was, I fancied,\r\nof no special rank or family, and who, like me, had simply turned up at\r\nthis family festivity. He was the first to catch my eye. He was a tall,\r\nlanky man, very grave and very correctly dressed. But one could see that\r\nhe was in no mood for merrymaking and family festivity; whenever he\r\nwithdrew into a corner he left off smiling and knitted his bushy black\r\nbrows. He had not a single acquaintance in the party except his host.\r\nOne could see that he was fearfully bored, but that he was valiantly\r\nkeeping up the part of a man perfectly happy and enjoying himself. I\r\nlearned afterwards that this was a gentleman from the provinces, who had\r\na critical and perplexing piece of business in Petersburg, who had\r\nbrought a letter of introduction to our host, for whom our host was, by\r\nno means _con amore_, using his interest, and whom he had invited, out\r\nof civility, to his children's party. He did not play cards, cigars were\r\nnot offered him, every one avoided entering into conversation with him,\r\nmost likely recognizing the bird from its feathers; and so my gentleman\r\nwas forced to sit the whole evening stroking his whiskers simply to have\r\nsomething to do with his hands. His whiskers were certainly very fine.\r\nBut he stroked them so zealously that, looking at him, one might have\r\nsupposed that the whiskers were created first and the gentleman only\r\nattached to them in order to stroke them.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this individual who assisted in this way at our host's\r\nfamily festivity (he had five fat, well-fed boys), I was attracted, too,\r\nby another gentleman. But he was quite of a different sort. He was a\r\npersonage. He was called Yulian Mastakovitch. From the first glance one\r\ncould see that he was an honoured guest, and stood in the same relation\r\nto our host as our host stood in relation to the gentleman who was\r\nstroking his whiskers. Our host and hostess said no end of polite things\r\nto him, waited on him hand and foot, pressed him to drink, flattered\r\nhim, brought their visitors up to be introduced to him, but did not take\r\nhim to be introduced to any one else. I noticed that tears glistened in\r\nour host's eyes when he remarked about the party that he had rarely\r\nspent an evening so agreeably. I felt as it were frightened in the\r\npresence of such a personage, and so, after admiring the children, I\r\nwent away into a little parlour, which was quite empty, and sat down in\r\nan arbour of flowers which filled up almost half the room.\r\n\r\nThe children were all incredibly sweet, and resolutely refused to model\r\nthemselves on the \"grown-ups,\" regardless of all the admonitions of\r\ntheir governesses and mammas. They stripped the Christmas tree to the\r\nlast sweetmeat in the twinkling of an eye, and had succeeded in breaking\r\nhalf the playthings before they knew what was destined for which.\r\nParticularly charming was a black-eyed, curly-headed boy, who kept\r\ntrying to shoot me with his wooden gun. But my attention was still more\r\nattracted by his sister, a girl of eleven, quiet, dreamy, pale, with\r\nbig, prominent, dreamy eyes, exquisite as a little Cupid. The children\r\nhurt her feelings in some way, and so she came away from them to the\r\nsame empty parlour in which I was sitting, and played with her doll in\r\nthe corner. The visitors respectfully pointed out her father, a wealthy\r\ncontractor, and some one whispered that three hundred thousand roubles\r\nwere already set aside for her dowry. I turned round to glance at the\r\ngroup who were interested in such a circumstance, and my eye fell on\r\nYulian Mastakovitch, who, with his hands behind his back and his head on\r\none side, was listening with the greatest attention to these gentlemen's\r\nidle gossip. Afterwards I could not help admiring the discrimination of\r\nthe host and hostess in the distribution of the children's presents. The\r\nlittle girl, who had already a portion of three hundred thousand\r\nroubles, received the costliest doll. Then followed presents diminishing\r\nin value in accordance with the rank of the parents of these happy\r\nchildren; finally, the child of lowest degree, a thin, freckled,\r\nred-haired little boy of ten, got nothing but a book of stories about\r\nthe marvels of nature and tears of devotion, etc., without pictures or\r\neven woodcuts. He was the son of a poor widow, the governess of the\r\nchildren of the house, an oppressed and scared little boy. He was\r\ndressed in a short jacket of inferior nankin. After receiving his book\r\nhe walked round the other toys for a long time; he longed to play with\r\nthe other children, but did not dare; it was evident that he already\r\nfelt and understood his position. I love watching children. Their first\r\nindependent approaches to life are extremely interesting. I noticed that\r\nthe red-haired boy was so fascinated by the costly toys of the other\r\nchildren, especially by a theatre in which he certainly longed to take\r\nsome part, that he made up his mind to sacrifice his dignity. He smiled\r\nand began playing with the other children, he gave away his apple to a\r\nfat-faced little boy who had a mass of goodies tied up in a\r\npocket-handkerchief already, and even brought himself to carry another\r\nboy on his back, simply not to be turned away from the theatre, but an\r\ninsolent youth gave him a heavy thump a minute later. The child did not\r\ndare to cry. Then the governess, his mother, made her appearance, and\r\ntold him not to interfere with the other children's playing. The boy\r\nwent away to the same room in which was the little girl. She let him\r\njoin her, and the two set to work very eagerly dressing the expensive\r\ndoll.\r\n\r\nI had been sitting more than half an hour in the ivy arbour, listening\r\nto the little prattle of the red-haired boy and the beauty with the\r\ndowry of three hundred thousand, who was nursing her doll, when Yulian\r\nMastakovitch suddenly walked into the room. He had taken advantage of\r\nthe general commotion following a quarrel among the children to step out\r\nof the drawing-room. I had noticed him a moment before talking very\r\ncordially to the future heiress's papa, whose acquaintance he had just\r\nmade, of the superiority of one branch of the service over another. Now\r\nhe stood in hesitation and seemed to be reckoning something on his\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\n\"Three hundred ... three hundred,\" he was whispering. \"Eleven ... twelve\r\n... thirteen,\" and so on. \"Sixteen--five years! Supposing it is at four\r\nper cent.--five times twelve is sixty; yes, to that sixty ... well, in\r\nfive years we may assume it will be four hundred. Yes!... But he won't\r\nstick to four per cent., the rascal. He can get eight or ten. Well, five\r\nhundred, let us say, five hundred at least ... that's certain; well, say\r\na little more for frills. H'm!...\"\r\n\r\nHis hesitation was at an end, he blew his nose and was on the point of\r\ngoing out of the room when he suddenly glanced at the little girl and\r\nstopped short. He did not see me behind the pots of greenery. It seemed\r\nto me that he was greatly excited. Either his calculations had affected\r\nhis imagination or something else, for he rubbed his hands and could\r\nhardly stand still. This excitement reached its utmost limit when he\r\nstopped and bent another resolute glance at the future heiress. He was\r\nabout to move forward, but first looked round, then moving on tiptoe, as\r\nthough he felt guilty, he advanced towards the children. He approached\r\nwith a little smile, bent down and kissed her on the head. The child,\r\nnot expecting this attack, uttered a cry of alarm.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing here, sweet child?\" he asked in a whisper, looking\r\nround and patting the girl's cheek.\r\n\r\n\"We are playing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! With him?\" Yulian Mastakovitch looked askance at the boy. \"You had\r\nbetter go into the drawing-room, my dear,\" he said to him.\r\n\r\nThe boy looked at him open-eyed and did not utter a word. Yulian\r\nMastakovitch looked round him again, and again bent down to the little\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\n\"And what is this you've got--a dolly, dear child?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, a dolly,\" answered the child, frowning, and a little shy.\r\n\r\n\"A dolly ... and do you know, dear child, what your dolly is made of?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know ...\" the child answered in a whisper, hanging her head.\r\n\r\n\"It's made of rags, darling. You had better go into the drawing-room to\r\nyour playmates, boy,\" said Yulian Mastakovitch, looking sternly at the\r\nboy. The boy and girl frowned and clutched at each other. They did not\r\nwant to be separated.\r\n\r\n\"And do you know why they gave you that doll?\" asked Yulian\r\nMastakovitch, dropping his voice to a softer and softer tone.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because you have been a sweet and well-behaved child all the week.\"\r\n\r\nAt this point Yulian Mastakovitch, more excited than ever, speaking in\r\nmost dulcet tones, asked at last, in a hardly audible voice choked with\r\nemotion and impatience--\r\n\r\n\"And will you love me, dear little girl, when I come and see your papa\r\nand mamma?\"\r\n\r\nSaying this, Yulian Mastakovitch tried once more to kiss \"the dear\r\nlittle girl,\" but the red-haired boy, seeing that the little girl was on\r\nthe point of tears, clutched her hand and began whimpering from sympathy\r\nfor her. Yulian Mastakovitch was angry in earnest.\r\n\r\n\"Go away, go away from here, go away!\" he said to the boy. \"Go into the\r\ndrawing-room! Go in there to your playmates!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, he needn't, he needn't! You go away,\" said the little girl. \"Leave\r\nhim alone, leave him alone,\" she said, almost crying.\r\n\r\nSome one made a sound at the door. Yulian Mastakovitch instantly raised\r\nhis majestic person and took alarm. But the red-haired boy was even more\r\nalarmed than Yulian Mastakovitch; he abandoned the little girl and,\r\nslinking along by the wall, stole out of the parlour into the\r\ndining-room. To avoid arousing suspicion, Yulian Mastakovitch, too, went\r\ninto the dining-room. He was as red as a lobster, and, glancing into the\r\nlooking-glass, seemed to be ashamed at himself. He was perhaps vexed\r\nwith himself for his impetuosity and hastiness. Possibly, he was at\r\nfirst so much impressed by his calculations, so inspired and fascinated\r\nby them, that in spite of his seriousness and dignity he made up his\r\nmind to behave like a boy, and directly approach the object of his\r\nattentions, even though she could not be really the object of his\r\nattentions for another five years at least. I followed the estimable\r\ngentleman into the dining-room and there beheld a strange spectacle.\r\nYulian Mastakovitch, flushed with vexation and anger, was frightening\r\nthe red-haired boy, who, retreating from him, did not know where to run\r\nin his terror.\r\n\r\n\"Go away; what are you doing here? Go away, you scamp; are you after the\r\nfruit here, eh? Get along, you naughty boy! Get along, you sniveller, to\r\nyour playmates!\"\r\n\r\nThe panic-stricken boy in his desperation tried creeping under the\r\ntable. Then his persecutor, in a fury, took out his large batiste\r\nhandkerchief and began flicking it under the table at the child, who\r\nkept perfectly quiet. It must be observed that Yulian Mastakovitch was a\r\nlittle inclined to be fat. He was a sleek, red-faced, solidly built man,\r\npaunchy, with thick legs; what is called a fine figure of a man, round\r\nas a nut. He was perspiring, breathless, and fearfully flushed. At last\r\nhe was almost rigid, so great was his indignation and perhaps--who\r\nknows?--his jealousy. I burst into loud laughter. Yulian Mastakovitch\r\nturned round and, in spite of all his consequence, was overcome with\r\nconfusion. At that moment from the opposite door our host came in. The\r\nboy crept out from under the table and wiped his elbows and his knees.\r\nYulian Mastakovitch hastened to put to his nose the handkerchief which\r\nhe was holding in his hand by one end.\r\n\r\nOur host looked at the three of us in some perplexity; but as a man who\r\nknew something of life, and looked at it from a serious point of view,\r\nhe at once availed himself of the chance of catching his visitor by\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\"Here, this is the boy,\" he said, pointing to the red-haired boy, \"for\r\nwhom I had the honour to solicit your influence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Yulian Mastakovitch, who had hardly quite recovered himself.\r\n\r\n\"The son of my children's governess,\" said our host, in a tone of a\r\npetitioner, \"a poor woman, the widow of an honest civil servant; and\r\ntherefore ... and therefore, Yulian Mastakovitch, if it were possible\r\n...\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, no!\" Yulian Mastakovitch made haste to answer; \"no, excuse me,\r\nFilip Alexyevitch, it's quite impossible. I've made inquiries; there's\r\nno vacancy, and if there were, there are twenty applicants who have far\r\nmore claim than he.... I am very sorry, very sorry....\"\r\n\r\n\"What a pity,\" said our host. \"He is a quiet, well-behaved boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"A great rascal, as I notice,\" answered Yulian Mastakovitch, with a\r\nnervous twist of his lip. \"Get along, boy; why are you standing there?\r\nGo to your playmates,\" he said, addressing the child.\r\n\r\nAt that point he could not contain himself, and glanced at me out of one\r\neye. I, too, could not contain myself, and laughed straight in his face.\r\nYulian Mastakovitch turned away at once, and in a voice calculated to\r\nreach my ear, asked who was that strange young man? They whispered\r\ntogether and walked out of the room. I saw Yulian Mastakovitch\r\nafterwards shaking his head incredulously as our host talked to him.\r\n\r\nAfter laughing to my heart's content I returned to the drawing-room.\r\nThere the great man, surrounded by fathers and mothers of families,\r\nincluding the host and hostess, was saying something very warmly to a\r\nlady to whom he had just been introduced. The lady was holding by the\r\nhand the little girl with whom Yulian Mastakovitch had had the scene in\r\nthe parlour a little while before. Now he was launching into praises and\r\nraptures over the beauty, the talents, the grace and the charming\r\nmanners of the charming child. He was unmistakably making up to the\r\nmamma. The mother listened to him almost with tears of delight. The\r\nfather's lips were smiling. Our host was delighted at the general\r\nsatisfaction. All the guests, in fact, were sympathetically gratified;\r\neven the children's games were checked that they might not hinder the\r\nconversation: the whole atmosphere was saturated with reverence. I heard\r\nafterwards the mamma of the interesting child, deeply touched, beg\r\nYulian Mastakovitch, in carefully chosen phrases, to do her the special\r\nhonour of bestowing upon them the precious gift of his acquaintance, and\r\nheard with what unaffected delight Yulian Mastakovitch accepted the\r\ninvitation, and how afterwards the guests, dispersing in different\r\ndirections, moving away with the greatest propriety, poured out to one\r\nanother the most touchingly flattering comments upon the contractor, his\r\nwife, his little girl, and, above all, upon Yulian Mastakovitch.\r\n\r\n\"Is that gentleman married?\" I asked, almost aloud, of one of my\r\nacquaintances, who was standing nearest to Yulian Mastakovitch. Yulian\r\nMastakovitch flung a searching and vindictive glance at me.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" answered my acquaintance, chagrined to the bottom of his heart by\r\nthe awkwardness of which I had intentionally been guilty....\r\n\r\n * * * * *\r\n\r\nI passed lately by a certain church; I was struck by the crowd of people\r\nin carriages. I heard people talking of the wedding. It was a cloudy\r\nday, it was beginning to sleet. I made my way through the crowd at the\r\ndoor and saw the bridegroom. He was a sleek, well-fed, round, paunchy\r\nman, very gorgeously dressed up. He was running fussily about, giving\r\norders. At last the news passed through the crowd that the bride was\r\ncoming. I squeezed my way through the crowd and saw a marvellous beauty,\r\nwho could scarcely have reached her first season. But the beauty was\r\npale and melancholy. She looked preoccupied; I even fancied that her\r\neyes were red with recent weeping. The classic severity of every feature\r\nof her face gave a certain dignity and seriousness to her beauty. But\r\nthrough that sternness and dignity, through that melancholy, could be\r\nseen the look of childish innocence; something indescribably naive,\r\nfluid, youthful, which seemed mutely begging for mercy.\r\n\r\nPeople were saying that she was only just sixteen. Glancing attentively\r\nat the bridegroom, I suddenly recognized him as Yulian Mastakovitch,\r\nwhom I had not seen for five years. I looked at her. My God! I began to\r\nsqueeze my way as quickly as I could out of the church. I heard people\r\nsaying in the crowd that the bride was an heiress, that she had a dowry\r\nof five hundred thousand ... and a trousseau worth ever so much.\r\n\r\n\"It was a good stroke of business, though!\" I thought as I made my way\r\ninto the street.\r\n\nPOLZUNKOV\r\n\r\nA STORY\r\n\nI began to scrutinize the man closely. Even in his exterior there was\r\nsomething so peculiar that it compelled one, however far away one's\r\nthoughts might be, to fix one's eyes upon him and go off into the most\r\nirrepressible roar of laughter. That is what happened to me. I must\r\nobserve that the little man's eyes were so mobile, or perhaps he was so\r\nsensitive to the magnetism of every eye fixed upon him, that he almost\r\nby instinct guessed that he was being observed, turned at once to the\r\nobserver and anxiously analysed his expression. His continual mobility,\r\nhis turning and twisting, made him look strikingly like a dancing doll.\r\nIt was strange! He seemed afraid of jeers, in spite of the fact that he\r\nwas almost getting his living by being a buffoon for all the world, and\r\nexposed himself to every buffet in a moral sense and even in a physical\r\none, judging from the company he was in. Voluntary buffoons are not even\r\nto be pitied. But I noticed at once that this strange creature, this\r\nridiculous man, was by no means a buffoon by profession. There was still\r\nsomething gentlemanly in him. His very uneasiness, his continual\r\napprehensiveness about himself, were actually a testimony in his favour.\r\nIt seemed to me that his desire to be obliging was due more to kindness\r\nof heart than to mercenary considerations. He readily allowed them to\r\nlaugh their loudest at him and in the most unseemly way, to his face,\r\nbut at the same time--and I am ready to take my oath on it--his heart\r\nached and was sore at the thought that his listeners were so caddishly\r\nbrutal as to be capable of laughing, not at anything said or done, but\r\nat him, at his whole being, at his heart, at his head, at his\r\nappearance, at his whole body, flesh and blood. I am convinced that he\r\nfelt at that moment all the foolishness of his position; but the protest\r\ndied away in his heart at once, though it invariably sprang up again in\r\nthe most heroic way. I am convinced that all this was due to nothing\r\nelse but a kind heart, and not to fear of the inconvenience of being\r\nkicked out and being unable to borrow money from some one. This\r\ngentleman was for ever borrowing money, that is, he asked for alms in\r\nthat form, when after playing the fool and entertaining them at his\r\nexpense he felt in a certain sense entitled to borrow money from them.\r\nBut, good heavens! what a business the borrowing was! And with what a\r\ncountenance he asked for the loan! I could not have imagined that on\r\nsuch a small space as the wrinkled, angular face of that little man room\r\ncould be found, at one and the same time, for so many different\r\ngrimaces, for such strange, variously characteristic shades of feeling,\r\nsuch absolutely killing expressions. Everything was there--shame and an\r\nassumption of insolence, and vexation at the sudden flushing of his\r\nface, and anger and fear of failure, and entreaty to be forgiven for\r\nhaving dared to pester, and a sense of his own dignity, and a still\r\ngreater sense of his own abjectness--all this passed over his face like\r\nlightning. For six whole years he had struggled along in God's world in\r\nthis way, and so far had been unable to take up a fitting attitude at\r\nthe interesting moment of borrowing money! I need not say that he never\r\ncould grow callous and completely abject. His heart was too sensitive,\r\ntoo passionate! I will say more, indeed: in my opinion, he was one of\r\nthe most honest and honourable men in the world, but with a little\r\nweakness: of being ready to do anything abject at any one's bidding,\r\ngood-naturedly and disinterestedly, simply to oblige a fellow-creature.\r\nIn short, he was what is called \"a rag\" in the fullest sense of the\r\nword. The most absurd thing was, that he was dressed like any one else,\r\nneither worse nor better, tidily, even with a certain elaborateness, and\r\nactually had pretentions to respectability and personal dignity. This\r\nexternal equality and internal inequality, his uneasiness about himself\r\nand at the same time his continual self-depreciation--all this was\r\nstrikingly incongruous and provocative of laughter and pity. If he had\r\nbeen convinced in his heart (and in spite of his experience it did\r\nhappen to him at moments to believe this) that his audience were the\r\nmost good-natured people in the world, who were simply laughing at\r\nsomething amusing, and not at the sacrifice of his personal dignity, he\r\nwould most readily have taken off his coat, put it on wrong side\r\noutwards, and have walked about the streets in that attire for the\r\ndiversion of others and his own gratification. But equality he could\r\nnever anyhow attain. Another trait: the queer fellow was proud, and\r\neven, by fits and starts, when it was not too risky, generous. It was\r\nworth seeing and hearing how he could sometimes, not sparing himself,\r\nconsequently with pluck, almost with heroism, dispose of one of his\r\npatrons who had infuriated him to madness. But that was at moments....\r\nIn short, he was a martyr in the fullest sense of the word, but the most\r\nuseless and consequently the most comic martyr.\r\n\r\nThere was a general discussion going on among the guests. All at once I\r\nsaw our queer friend jump upon his chair, and call out at the top of his\r\nvoice, anxious for the exclusive attention of the company.\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" the master of the house whispered to me. \"He sometimes tells\r\nthe most curious stories.... Does he interest you?\"\r\n\r\nI nodded and squeezed myself into the group. The sight of a well-dressed\r\ngentleman jumping upon his chair and shouting at the top of his voice\r\ndid, in fact, draw the attention of all. Many who did not know the queer\r\nfellow looked at one another in perplexity, the others roared with\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n\"I knew Fedosey Nikolaitch. I ought to know Fedosey Nikolaitch better\r\nthan any one!\" cried the queer fellow from his elevation. \"Gentlemen,\r\nallow me to tell you something. I can tell you a good story about\r\nFedosey Nikolaitch! I know a story--exquisite!\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell it, Osip Mihalitch, tell it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen, listen.\"\r\n\r\n\"I begin; but, gentlemen, this is a peculiar story....\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, very good.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a comic story.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, excellent, splendid. Get on!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is an episode in the private life of your humble....\"\r\n\r\n\"But why do you trouble yourself to announce that it's comic?\"\r\n\r\n\"And even somewhat tragic!\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh???!\"\r\n\r\n\"In short, the story which it will afford you all pleasure to hear me\r\nnow relate, gentlemen--the story, in consequence of which I have come\r\ninto company so interesting and profitable....\"\r\n\r\n\"No puns!\"\r\n\r\n\"This story.\"\r\n\r\n\"In short the story--make haste and finish the introduction. The story,\r\nwhich has its value,\" a fair-haired young man with moustaches pronounced\r\nin a husky voice, dropping his hand into his coat pocket and, as though\r\nby chance, pulling out a purse instead of his handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\"The story, my dear sirs, after which I should like to see many of you\r\nin my place. And, finally, the story, in consequence of which I have not\r\nmarried.\"\r\n\r\n\"Married! A wife! Polzunkov tried to get married!!\"\r\n\r\n\"I confess I should like to see Madame Polzunkov.\"\r\n\r\n\"Allow me to inquire the name of the would-be Madame Polzunkov,\" piped a\r\nyouth, making his way up to the storyteller.\r\n\r\n\"And so for the first chapter, gentlemen. It was just six years ago, in\r\nspring, the thirty-first of March--note the date, gentlemen--on the\r\neve....\"\r\n\r\n\"Of the first of April!\" cried a young man with ringlets.\r\n\r\n\"You are extraordinarily quick at guessing. It was evening. Twilight was\r\ngathering over the district town of N., the moon was about to float out\r\n... everything in proper style, in fact. And so in the very late\r\ntwilight I, too, floated out of my poor lodging on the sly--after taking\r\nleave of my restricted granny, now dead. Excuse me, gentlemen, for\r\nmaking use of such a fashionable expression, which I heard for the last\r\ntime from Nikolay Nikolaitch. But my granny was indeed restricted: she\r\nwas blind, dumb, deaf, stupid--everything you please.... I confess I was\r\nin a tremor, I was prepared for great deeds; my heart was beating like a\r\nkitten's when some bony hand clutches it by the scruff of the neck.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, Monsieur Polzunkov.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you want?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell it more simply; don't over-exert yourself, please!\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Osip Mihalitch, a little taken aback. \"I went into the\r\nhouse of Fedosey Nikolaitch (the house that he had bought). Fedosey\r\nNikolaitch, as you know, is not a mere colleague, but the full-blown\r\nhead of a department. I was announced, and was at once shown into the\r\nstudy. I can see it now; the room was dark, almost dark, but candles\r\nwere not brought. Behold, Fedosey Nikolaitch walks in. There he and I\r\nwere left in the darkness....\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever happened to you?\" asked an officer.\r\n\r\n\"What do you suppose?\" asked Polzunkov, turning promptly, with a\r\nconvulsively working face, to the young man with ringlets. \"Well,\r\ngentlemen, a strange circumstance occurred, though indeed there was\r\nnothing strange in it: it was what is called an everyday affair--I\r\nsimply took out of my pocket a roll of paper ... and he a roll of\r\npaper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Paper notes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Paper notes; and we exchanged.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mind betting that there's a flavour of bribery about it,\"\r\nobserved a respectably dressed, closely cropped young gentleman.\r\n\r\n\"Bribery!\" Polzunkov caught him up.\r\n\r\n \"'Oh, may I be a Liberal,\r\n Such as many I have seen!'\r\n\r\nIf you, too, when it is your lot to serve in the provinces, do not warm\r\nyour hands at your country's hearth.... For as an author said: 'Even the\r\nsmoke of our native land is sweet to us.' She is our Mother, gentlemen,\r\nour Mother Russia; we are her babes, and so we suck her!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a roar of laughter.\r\n\r\n\"Only would you believe it, gentlemen, I have never taken bribes?\" said\r\nPolzunkov, looking round at the whole company distrustfully.\r\n\r\nA prolonged burst of Homeric laughter drowned Polzunkov's words in\r\nguffaws.\r\n\r\n\"It really is so, gentlemen....\"\r\n\r\nBut here he stopped, still looking round at every one with a strange\r\nexpression of face; perhaps--who knows?--at that moment the thought came\r\ninto his mind that he was more honest than many of all that honourable\r\ncompany.... Anyway, the serious expression of his face did not pass away\r\ntill the general merriment was quite over.\r\n\r\n\"And so,\" Polzunkov began again when all was still, \"though I never did\r\ntake bribes, yet that time I transgressed; I put in my pocket a bribe\r\n... from a bribe-taker ... that is, there were certain papers in my\r\nhands which, if I had cared to send to a certain person, it would have\r\ngone ill with Fedosey Nikolaitch.\"\r\n\r\n\"So then he bought them from you?\"\r\n\r\n\"He did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he give much?\"\r\n\r\n\"He gave as much as many a man nowadays would sell his conscience for\r\ncomplete, with all its variations ... if only he could get anything for\r\nit. But I felt as though I were scalded when I put the money in my\r\npocket. I really don't understand what always comes over me,\r\ngentlemen--but I was more dead than alive, my lips twitched and my legs\r\ntrembled; well, I was to blame, to blame, entirely to blame. I was\r\nutterly conscience-stricken; I was ready to beg Fedosey Nikolaitch's\r\nforgiveness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what did he do--did he forgive you?\"\r\n\r\n\"But I didn't ask his forgiveness.... I only mean that that is how I\r\nfelt. Then I have a sensitive heart, you know. I saw he was looking me\r\nstraight in the face. 'Have you no fear of God, Osip Mihailitch?' said\r\nhe. Well, what could I do? From a feeling of propriety I put my head on\r\none side and I flung up my hands. 'In what way,' said I, 'have I no fear\r\nof God, Fedosey Nikolaitch?' But I just said that from a feeling of\r\npropriety.... I was ready to sink into the earth. 'After being so long a\r\nfriend of our family, after being, I may say, like a son--and who knows\r\nwhat Heaven had in store for us, Osip Mihailitch?--and all of a sudden\r\nto inform against me--to think of that now!... What am I to think of\r\nmankind after that, Osip Mihailitch?' Yes, gentlemen, he did read me a\r\nlecture! 'Come,' he said, 'you tell me what I am to think of mankind\r\nafter that, Osip Mihailitch.' 'What is he to think?' I thought; and do\r\nyou know, there was a lump in my throat, and my voice was quivering, and\r\nknowing my hateful weakness, I snatched up my hat. 'Where are you off\r\nto, Osip Mihailitch? Surely on the eve of such a day you cannot bear\r\nmalice against me? What wrong have I done you?...' 'Fedosey Nikolaitch,'\r\nI said, 'Fedosey Nikolaitch....' In fact, I melted, gentlemen, I melted\r\nlike a sugar-stick. And the roll of notes that was lying in my pocket,\r\nthat, too, seemed screaming out: 'You ungrateful brigand, you accursed\r\nthief!' It seemed to weigh a hundredweight ... (if only it had weighed a\r\nhundredweight!).... 'I see,' says Fedosey Nikolaitch, 'I see your\r\npenitence ... you know to-morrow....' 'St. Mary of Egypt's day....'\r\n'Well, don't weep,' said Fedosey Nikolaitch, 'that's enough: you've\r\nerred, and you are penitent! Come along! Maybe I may succeed in bringing\r\nyou back again into the true path,' says he ... 'maybe, my modest\r\nPenates' (yes,'Penates,' I remember he used that expression, the rascal)\r\n'will warm,' says he, 'your harden ... I will not say hardened, but\r\nerring heart....' He took me by the arm, gentlemen, and led me to his\r\nfamily circle. A cold shiver ran down my back; I shuddered! I thought\r\nwith what eyes shall I present myself--you must know, gentlemen ... eh,\r\nwhat shall I say?--a delicate position had arisen here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not Madame Polzunkov?\"\r\n\r\n\"Marya Fedosyevna, only she was not destined, you know, to bear the name\r\nyou have given her; she did not attain that honour. Fedosey Nikolaitch\r\nwas right, you see, when he said that I was almost looked upon as a son\r\nin the house; it had been so, indeed, six months before, when a certain\r\nretired junker called Mihailo Maximitch Dvigailov, was still living. But\r\nby God's will he died, and he put off settling his affairs till death\r\nsettled his business for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ough!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, never mind, gentlemen, forgive me, it was a slip of the tongue.\r\nIt's a bad pun, but it doesn't matter it's being bad--what happened was\r\nfar worse, when I was left, so to say, with nothing in prospect but a\r\nbullet through the brain, for that junker, though he would not admit me\r\ninto his house (he lived in grand style, for he had always known how to\r\nfeather his nest), yet perhaps correctly he believed me to be his son.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aha!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that was how it was! So they began to cold-shoulder me at Fedosey\r\nNikolaitch's. I noticed things, I kept quiet; but all at once, unluckily\r\nfor me (or perhaps luckily!), a cavalry officer galloped into our little\r\ntown like snow on our head. His business--buying horses for the\r\narmy--was light and active, in cavalry style, but he settled himself\r\nsolidly at Fedosey Nikolaitch's, as though he were laying siege to it! I\r\napproached the subject in a roundabout way, as my nasty habit is; I said\r\none thing and another, asking him what I had done to be treated so,\r\nsaying that I was almost like a son to him, and when might I expect him\r\nto behave more like a father.... Well, he began answering me. And when\r\nhe begins to speak you are in for a regular epic in twelve cantos, and\r\nall you can do is to listen, lick your lips and throw up your hands in\r\ndelight. And not a ha'p'orth of sense, at least there's no making out\r\nthe sense. You stand puzzled like a fool--he puts you in a fog, he\r\ntwists about like an eel and wriggles away from you. It's a special\r\ngift, a real gift--it's enough to frighten people even if it is no\r\nconcern of theirs. I tried one thing and another, and went hither and\r\nthither. I took the lady songs and presented her with sweets and thought\r\nof witty things to say to her. I tried sighing and groaning. 'My heart\r\naches,' I said, 'it aches from love.' And I went in for tears and secret\r\nexplanations. Man is foolish, you know.... I never reminded myself that\r\nI was thirty ... not a bit of it! I tried all my arts. It was no go. It\r\nwas a failure, and I gained nothing but jeers and gibes. I was\r\nindignant, I was choking with anger. I slunk off and would not set foot\r\nin the house. I thought and thought and made up my mind to denounce him.\r\nWell, of course, it was a shabby thing--I meant to give away a friend, I\r\nconfess. I had heaps of material and splendid material--a grand case. It\r\nbrought me fifteen hundred roubles when I changed it and my report on it\r\nfor bank notes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, so that was the bribe!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, that was the bribe--and it was a bribe-taker who had to pay\r\nit--and I didn't do wrong, I can assure you! Well, now I will go on: he\r\ndrew me, if you will kindly remember, more dead than alive into the room\r\nwhere they were having tea. They all met me, seeming as it were\r\noffended, that is, not exactly offended, but hurt--so hurt that it was\r\nsimply.... They seemed shattered, absolutely shattered, and at the same\r\ntime there was a look of becoming dignity on their faces, a gravity in\r\ntheir expression, something fatherly, parental ... the prodigal son had\r\ncome back to them--that's what it had come to! They made me sit down to\r\ntea, but there was no need to do that: I felt as though a samovar was\r\ntoiling in my bosom and my feet were like ice. I was humbled, I was\r\ncowed. Marya Fominishna, his wife, addressed me familiarly from the\r\nfirst word.\r\n\r\n\"'How is it you have grown so thin, my boy?'\r\n\r\n\"'I've not been very well, Marya Fominishna,' I said. My wretched voice\r\nshook.\r\n\r\n\"And then quite suddenly--she must have been waiting for a chance to get\r\na dig at me, the old snake--she said--\r\n\r\n\"'I suppose your conscience felt ill at ease, Osip Mihalitch, my dear!\r\nOur fatherly hospitality was a reproach to you! You have been punished\r\nfor the tears I have shed.'\r\n\r\n\"Yes, upon my word, she really said that--she had the conscience to say\r\nit. Why, that was nothing to her, she was a terror! She did nothing but\r\nsit there and pour out tea. But if you were in the market, my darling, I\r\nthought you'd shout louder than any fishwife there.... That's the kind\r\nof woman she was. And then, to my undoing, the daughter, Marya\r\nFedosyevna, came in, in all her innocence, a little pale and her eyes\r\nred as though she had been weeping. I was bowled over on the spot like a\r\nfool. But it turned out afterwards that the tears were a tribute to the\r\ncavalry officer. He had made tracks for home and taken his hook for good\r\nand all; for you know it was high time for him to be off--I may as well\r\nmention the fact here; not that his leave was up precisely, but you\r\nsee.... It was only later that the loving parents grasped the position\r\nand had found out all that had happened.... What could they do? They\r\nhushed their trouble up--an addition to the family!\r\n\r\n\"Well, I could not help it--as soon as I looked at her I was done for; I\r\nstole a glance at my hat, I wanted to get up and make off. But there was\r\nno chance of that, they took away my hat.... I must confess, I did think\r\nof getting off without it. 'Well!' I thought--but no, they latched the\r\ndoors. There followed friendly jokes, winking, little airs and graces. I\r\nwas overcome with embarrassment, said something stupid, talked nonsense,\r\nabout love. My charmer sat down to the piano and with an air of wounded\r\nfeeling sang the song about the hussar who leaned upon the sword--that\r\nfinished me off!\r\n\r\n\"'Well,' said Fedosey Nikolaitch, 'all is forgotten, come to my arms!'\r\n\r\n\"I fell just as I was, with my face on his waistcoat.\r\n\r\n\"'My benefactor! You are a father to me!' said I. And I shed floods of\r\nhot tears. Lord, have mercy on us, what a to-do there was! He cried, his\r\ngood lady cried, Mashenka cried ... there was a flaxen-headed creature\r\nthere, she cried too.... That wasn't enough: the younger children crept\r\nout of all the corners (the Lord had filled their quiver full) and they\r\nhowled too.... Such tears, such emotion, such joy! They found their\r\nprodigal, it was like a soldier's return to his home. Then followed\r\nrefreshments, we played forfeits, and 'I have a pain'--'Where is\r\nit?'--'In my heart'--'Who gave it you?' My charmer blushed. The old man\r\nand I had some punch--they won me over and did for me completely.\r\n\r\n\"I returned to my grandmother with my head in a whirl. I was laughing\r\nall the way home; for full two hours I paced up and down our little\r\nroom. I waked up my old granny and told her of my happiness.\r\n\r\n\"'But did he give you any money, the brigand?'\r\n\r\n\"'He did, granny, he did, my dear--luck has come to us all of a heap:\r\nwe've only to open our hand and take it.'\r\n\r\n\"I waked up Sofron.\r\n\r\n\"'Sofron,' I said, 'take off my boots.'\r\n\r\n\"Sofron pulled off my boots.\r\n\r\n\"'Come, Sofron, congratulate me now, give me a kiss! I am going to get\r\nmarried, my lad, I am going to get married. You can get jolly drunk\r\nto-morrow, you can have a spree, my dear soul--your master is getting\r\nmarried.'\r\n\r\n\"My heart was full of jokes and laughter. I was beginning to drop off to\r\nsleep, but something made me get up again. I sat in thought: to-morrow\r\nis the first of April, a bright and playful day--what should I do? And I\r\nthought of something. Why, gentlemen, I got out of bed, lighted a\r\ncandle, and sat down to the writing-table just as I was. I was in a\r\nfever of excitement, quite carried away--you know, gentlemen, what it is\r\nwhen a man is quite carried away? I wallowed joyfully in the mud, my\r\ndear friends. You see what I am like; they take something from you, and\r\nyou give them something else as well and say, 'Take that, too.' They\r\nstrike you on the cheek and in your joy you offer them your whole back.\r\nThen they try to lure you like a dog with a bun, and you embrace them\r\nwith your foolish paws and fall to kissing them with all your heart and\r\nsoul. Why, see what I am doing now, gentlemen! You are laughing and\r\nwhispering--I see it! After I have told you all my story you will begin\r\nto turn me into ridicule, you will begin to attack me, but yet I go on\r\ntalking and talking and talking! And who tells me to? Who drives me to\r\ndo it? Who is standing behind my back whispering to me, 'Speak, speak\r\nand tell them'? And yet I do talk, I go on telling you, I try to please\r\nyou as though you were my brothers, all my dearest friends.... Ech!\"\r\n\r\nThe laughter which had sprung up by degrees on all sides completely\r\ndrowned at last the voice of the speaker, who really seemed worked up\r\ninto a sort of ecstasy. He paused, for several minutes his eyes strayed\r\nabout the company, then suddenly, as though carried away by a whirlwind,\r\nhe waved his hand, burst out laughing himself, as though he really found\r\nhis position amusing, and fell to telling his story again.\r\n\r\n\"I scarcely slept all night, gentlemen. I was scribbling all night: you\r\nsee, I thought of a trick. Ech, gentlemen, the very thought of it makes\r\nme ashamed. It wouldn't have been so bad if it all had been done at\r\nnight--I might have been drunk, blundered, been silly and talked\r\nnonsense--but not a bit of it! I woke up in the morning as soon as it\r\nwas light, I hadn't slept more than an hour or two, and was in the same\r\nmind. I dressed, I washed, I curled and pomaded my hair, put on my new\r\ndress coat and went straight off to spend the holiday with Fedosey\r\nNikolaitch, and I kept the joke I had written in my hat. He met me again\r\nwith open arms, and invited me again to his fatherly waistcoat. But I\r\nassumed an air of dignity. I had the joke I thought of the night before\r\nin my mind. I drew a step back.\r\n\r\n\"'No, Fedosey Nikolaitch, but will you please read this letter,' and I\r\ngave it him together with my daily report. And do you know what was in\r\nit? Why, 'for such and such reasons the aforesaid Osip Mihalitch asks to\r\nbe discharged,' and under my petition I signed my full rank! Just think\r\nwhat a notion! Good Lord, it was the cleverest thing I could think of!\r\nAs to-day was the first of April, I was pretending, for the sake of a\r\njoke, that my resentment was not over, that I had changed my mind in the\r\nnight and was grumpy, and more offended than ever, as though to say, 'My\r\ndear benefactor, I don't want to know you nor your daughter either. I\r\nput the money in my pocket yesterday, so I am secure--so here's my\r\npetition for a transfer to be discharged. I don't care to serve under\r\nsuch a chief as Fedosey Nikolaitch. I want to go into a different office\r\nand then, maybe, I'll inform.' I pretended to be a regular scoundrel, I\r\nwanted to frighten them. And a nice way of frightening them, wasn't it?\r\nA pretty thing, gentlemen, wasn't it? You see, my heart had grown tender\r\ntowards them since the day before, so I thought I would have a little\r\njoke at the family--I would tease the fatherly heart of Fedosey\r\nNikolaitch.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as he took my letter and opened it, I saw his whole countenance\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n\"'What's the meaning of this, Osip Mihalitch?'\r\n\r\n\"And like a little fool I said--\r\n\r\n\"'The first of April! Many happy returns of the day, Fedosey\r\nNikolaitch!' just like a silly school-boy who hides behind his\r\ngrandmother's arm-chair and then shouts 'oof' into her ear suddenly at\r\nthe top of his voice, meaning to frighten her. Yes ... yes, I feel quite\r\nashamed to talk about it, gentlemen! No, I won't tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense! What happened then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense, nonsense! Tell us! Yes, do,\" rose on all sides.\r\n\r\n\"There was an outcry and a hullabaloo, my dear friends! Such\r\nexclamations of surprise! And 'you mischievous fellow, you naughty man,'\r\nand what a fright I had given them--and all so sweet that I felt ashamed\r\nand wondered how such a holy place could be profaned by a sinner like\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"'Well, my dear boy,' piped the mamma, 'you gave me such a fright that\r\nmy legs are all of a tremble still, I can hardly stand on my feet! I ran\r\nto Masha as though I were crazy: \"Mashenka,\" I said, \"what will become\r\nof us! See how _your_ friend has turned out!\" and I was unjust to you,\r\nmy dear boy. You must forgive an old woman like me, I was taken in!\r\nWell, I thought, when he got home last night, he got home late, he began\r\nthinking and perhaps he fancied that we sent for him on purpose,\r\nyesterday, that we wanted to get hold of him. I turned cold at the\r\nthought! Give over, Mashenka, don't go on winking at me--Osip Mihalitch\r\nisn't a stranger! I am your mother, I am not likely to say any harm!\r\nThank God, I am not twenty, but turned forty-five.'\r\n\r\n\"Well, gentlemen, I almost flopped at her feet on the spot. Again there\r\nwere tears, again there were kisses. Jokes began. Fedosey Nikolaitch,\r\ntoo, thought he would make April fools of us. He told us the fiery bird\r\nhad flown up with a letter in her diamond beak! He tried to take us in,\r\ntoo--didn't we laugh? weren't we touched? Foo! I feel ashamed to talk\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\n\"Well, my good friends, the end is not far off now. One day\r\npassed, two, three, a week; I was regularly engaged to her. I should\r\nthink so! The wedding rings were ordered, the day was fixed, only they\r\ndid not want to make it public for a time--they wanted to wait for the\r\nInspector's visit to be over. I was all impatience for the Inspector's\r\narrival--my happiness depended upon him. I was in a hurry to get his\r\nvisit over. And in the excitement and rejoicing Fedosey Nikolaitch threw\r\nall the work upon me: writing up the accounts, making up the reports,\r\nchecking the books, balancing the totals. I found things in terrible\r\ndisorder--everything had been neglected, there were muddles and\r\nirregularities everywhere. Well, I thought, I must do my best for my\r\nfather-in-law! And he was ailing all the time, he was taken ill, it\r\nappears; he seemed to get worse day by day. And, indeed, I grew as thin\r\nas a rake myself, I was afraid I would break down. However, I finished\r\nthe work grandly. I got things straight for him in time.\r\n\r\n\"Suddenly they sent a messenger for me. I ran headlong--what could it\r\nbe? I saw my Fedosey Nikolaitch, his head bandaged up in a vinegar\r\ncompress, frowning, sighing, and moaning.\r\n\r\n\"'My dear boy, my son,' he said, 'if I die, to whom shall I leave you,\r\nmy darlings?'\r\n\r\n\"His wife trailed in with all his children; Mashenka was in tears and I\r\nblubbered, too.\r\n\r\n\"'Oh no,' he said. 'God will be merciful, He will not visit my\r\ntransgressions on you.'\r\n\r\n\"Then he dismissed them all, told me to shut the door after them, and we\r\nwere left alone, _tete-a-tete_.\r\n\r\n\"'I have a favour to ask of you.'\r\n\r\n\"'What favour?'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, my dear boy, there is no rest for me even on my deathbed. I am\r\nin want.'\r\n\r\n\"'How so?' I positively flushed crimson, I could hardly speak.\r\n\r\n\"'Why, I had to pay some of my own money into the Treasury. I grudge\r\nnothing for the public weal, my boy! I don't grudge my life. Don't you\r\nimagine any ill. I am sad to think that slanderers have blackened my\r\nname to you.... You were mistaken, my hair has gone white from grief.\r\nThe Inspector is coming down upon us and Matveyev is seven thousand\r\nroubles short, and I shall have to answer for it.... Who else? It will\r\nbe visited upon me, my boy: where were my eyes? And how can we get it\r\nfrom Matveyev? He has had trouble enough already: why should I bring the\r\npoor fellow to ruin?'\r\n\r\n\"'Holy saints!' I thought, 'what a just man! What a heart!'\r\n\r\n\"'And I don't want to take my daughter's money, which has been set aside\r\nfor her dowry: that sum is sacred. I have money of my own, it's true,\r\nbut I have lent it all to friends--how is one to collect it all in a\r\nminute?'\r\n\r\n\"I simply fell on my knees before him. 'My benefactor!' I cried, 'I've\r\nwronged you, I have injured you; it was slanderers who wrote against\r\nyou; don't break my heart, take back your money!'\r\n\r\n\"He looked at me and there were tears in his eyes. 'That was just what I\r\nexpected from you, my son. Get up! I forgave you at the time for the\r\nsake of my daughter's tears--now my heart forgives you freely! You have\r\nhealed my wounds. I bless you for all time!'\r\n\r\n\"Well, when he blessed me, gentlemen, I scurried home as soon as I\r\ncould. I got the money:\r\n\r\n\"'Here, father, here's the money. I've only spent fifty roubles.'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, that's all right,' he said. 'But now every trifle may count; the\r\ntime is short, write a report dated some days ago that you were short of\r\nmoney and had taken fifty roubles on account. I'll tell the authorities\r\nyou had it in advance.'\r\n\r\n\"Well, gentlemen, what do you think? I did write that report, too!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what then? What happened? How did it end?\"\r\n\r\n\"As soon as I had written the report, gentlemen, this is how it ended.\r\nThe next day, in the early morning, an envelope with a government seal\r\narrived. I looked at it and what had I got? The sack! That is,\r\ninstructions to hand over my work, to deliver the accounts--and to go\r\nabout my business!\"\r\n\r\n\"How so?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just what I cried at the top of my voice, 'How so?' Gentlemen,\r\nthere was a ringing in my ears. I thought there was no special reason\r\nfor it--but no, the Inspector had arrived in the town. My heart sank.\r\n'It's not for nothing,' I thought. And just as I was I rushed off to\r\nFedosey Nikolaitch.\r\n\r\n\"'How is this?' I said.\r\n\r\n\"'What do you mean?' he said.\r\n\r\n\"'Why, I am dismissed.'\r\n\r\n\"'Dismissed? how?'\r\n\r\n\"'Why, look at this!'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, what of it?'\r\n\r\n\"'Why, but I didn't ask for it!'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, you did--you sent in your papers on the first of--April.' (I had\r\nnever taken that letter back!)\r\n\r\n\"'Fedosey Nikolaitch! I can't believe my ears, I can't believe my eyes!\r\nIs this you?'\r\n\r\n\"'It is me, why?'\r\n\r\n\"'My God!'\r\n\r\n\"'I am sorry, sir. I am very sorry that you made up your mind to retire\r\nfrom the service so early. A young man ought to be in the service, and\r\nyou've begun to be a little light-headed of late. And as for your\r\ncharacter, set your mind at rest: I'll see to that! Your behaviour has\r\nalways been so exemplary!'\r\n\r\n\"'But that was a little joke, Fedosey Nikolaitch! I didn't mean it, I\r\njust gave you the letter for your fatherly ... that's all.'\r\n\r\n\"'That's all? A queer joke, sir! Does one jest with documents like that?\r\nWhy, you are sometimes sent to Siberia for such jokes. Now, good-bye. I\r\nam busy. We have the Inspector here--the duties of the service before\r\neverything; you can kick up your heels, but we have to sit here at work.\r\nBut I'll get you a character---- Oh, another thing: I've just bought a\r\nhouse from Matveyev. We are moving in in a day or two. So I expect I\r\nshall not have the pleasure of seeing you at our new residence. _Bon\r\nvoyage!_'\r\n\r\n\"I ran home.\r\n\r\n\"'We are lost, granny!'\r\n\r\n\"She wailed, poor dear, and then I saw the page from Fedosey\r\nNikolaitch's running up with a note and a bird-cage, and in the cage\r\nthere was a starling. In the fullness of my heart I had given her the\r\nstarling. And in the note there were the words: 'April 1st,' and nothing\r\nmore. What do you think of that, gentlemen?\"\r\n\r\n\"What happened then? What happened then?\"\r\n\r\n\"What then! I met Fedosey Nikolaitch once, I meant to tell him to his\r\nface he was a scoundrel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"But somehow I couldn't bring myself to it, gentlemen.\"\r\n\nA LITTLE HERO\r\n\r\nA STORY\r\n\nAt that time I was nearly eleven, I had been sent in July to spend the\r\nholiday in a village near Moscow with a relation of mine called T.,\r\nwhose house was full of guests, fifty, or perhaps more.... I don't\r\nremember, I didn't count. The house was full of noise and gaiety. It\r\nseemed as though it were a continual holiday, which would never end. It\r\nseemed as though our host had taken a vow to squander all his vast\r\nfortune as rapidly as possible, and he did indeed succeed, not long ago,\r\nin justifying this surmise, that is, in making a clean sweep of it all\r\nto the last stick.\r\n\r\nFresh visitors used to drive up every minute. Moscow was close by, in\r\nsight, so that those who drove away only made room for others, and the\r\neverlasting holiday went on its course. Festivities succeeded one\r\nanother, and there was no end in sight to the entertainments. There were\r\nriding parties about the environs; excursions to the forest or the\r\nriver; picnics, dinners in the open air; suppers on the great terrace of\r\nthe house, bordered with three rows of gorgeous flowers that flooded\r\nwith their fragrance the fresh night air, and illuminated the brilliant\r\nlights which made our ladies, who were almost every one of them pretty\r\nat all times, seem still more charming, with their faces excited by the\r\nimpressions of the day, with their sparkling eyes, with their\r\ninterchange of spritely conversation, their peals of ringing laughter;\r\ndancing, music, singing; if the sky were overcast tableaux vivants,\r\ncharades, proverbs were arranged, private theatricals were got up. There\r\nwere good talkers, story-tellers, wits.\r\n\r\nCertain persons were prominent in the foreground. Of course backbiting\r\nand slander ran their course, as without them the world could not get\r\non, and millions of persons would perish of boredom, like flies. But as\r\nI was at that time eleven I was absorbed by very different interests,\r\nand either failed to observe these people, or if I noticed anything, did\r\nnot see it all. It was only afterwards that some things came back to my\r\nmind. My childish eyes could only see the brilliant side of the picture,\r\nand the general animation, splendour, and bustle--all that, seen and\r\nheard for the first time, made such an impression upon me that for the\r\nfirst few days, I was completely bewildered and my little head was in a\r\nwhirl.\r\n\r\nI keep speaking of my age, and of course I was a child, nothing more\r\nthan a child. Many of these lovely ladies petted me without dreaming of\r\nconsidering my age. But strange to say, a sensation which I did not\r\nmyself understand already had possession of me; something was already\r\nwhispering in my heart, of which till then it had had no knowledge, no\r\nconception, and for some reason it began all at once to burn and throb,\r\nand often my face glowed with a sudden flush. At times I felt as it were\r\nabashed, and even resentful of the various privileges of my childish\r\nyears. At other times a sort of wonder overwhelmed me, and I would go\r\noff into some corner where I could sit unseen, as though to take breath\r\nand remember something--something which it seemed to me I had remembered\r\nperfectly till then, and now had suddenly forgotten, something without\r\nwhich I could not show myself anywhere, and could not exist at all.\r\n\r\nAt last it seemed to me as though I were hiding something from every\r\none. But nothing would have induced me to speak of it to any one,\r\nbecause, small boy that I was, I was ready to weep with shame. Soon in\r\nthe midst of the vortex around me I was conscious of a certain\r\nloneliness. There were other children, but all were either much older or\r\nyounger than I; besides, I was in no mood for them. Of course nothing\r\nwould have happened to me if I had not been in an exceptional position.\r\nIn the eyes of those charming ladies I was still the little unformed\r\ncreature whom they at once liked to pet, and with whom they could play\r\nas though he were a little doll. One of them particularly, a\r\nfascinating, fair woman, with very thick luxuriant hair, such as I had\r\nnever seen before and probably shall never see again, seemed to have\r\ntaken a vow never to leave me in peace. I was confused, while she was\r\namused by the laughter which she continually provoked from all around us\r\nby her wild, giddy pranks with me, and this apparently gave her immense\r\nenjoyment. At school among her schoolfellows she was probably nicknamed\r\nthe Tease. She was wonderfully good-looking, and there was something in\r\nher beauty which drew one's eyes from the first moment. And certainly\r\nshe had nothing in common with the ordinary modest little fair girls,\r\nwhite as down and soft as white mice, or pastors' daughters. She was not\r\nvery tall, and was rather plump, but had soft, delicate, exquisitely cut\r\nfeatures. There was something quick as lightning in her face, and indeed\r\nshe was like fire all over, light, swift, alive. Her big open eyes\r\nseemed to flash sparks; they glittered like diamonds, and I would never\r\nexchange such blue sparkling eyes for any black ones, were they blacker\r\nthan any Andalusian orb. And, indeed, my blonde was fully a match for\r\nthe famous brunette whose praises were sung by a great and well-known\r\npoet, who, in a superb poem, vowed by all Castille that he was ready to\r\nbreak his bones to be permitted only to touch the mantle of his divinity\r\nwith the tip of his finger. Add to that, that _my_ charmer was the\r\nmerriest in the world, the wildest giggler, playful as a child, although\r\nshe had been married for the last five years. There was a continual\r\nlaugh upon her lips, fresh as the morning rose that, with the first ray\r\nof sunshine, opens its fragrant crimson bud with the cool dewdrops still\r\nhanging heavy upon it.\r\n\r\nI remember that the day after my arrival private theatricals were being\r\ngot up. The drawing-room was, as they say, packed to overflowing; there\r\nwas not a seat empty, and as I was somehow late I had to enjoy the\r\nperformance standing. But the amusing play attracted me to move\r\nforwarder and forwarder, and unconsciously I made my way to the first\r\nrow, where I stood at last leaning my elbows on the back of an armchair,\r\nin which a lady was sitting. It was my blonde divinity, but we had not\r\nyet made acquaintance. And I gazed, as it happened, at her marvellous,\r\nfascinating shoulders, plump and white as milk, though it did not matter\r\nto me in the least whether I stared at a woman's exquisite shoulders or\r\nat the cap with flaming ribbons that covered the grey locks of a\r\nvenerable lady in the front row. Near my blonde divinity sat a spinster\r\nlady not in her first youth, one of those who, as I chanced to observe\r\nlater, always take refuge in the immediate neighbourhood of young and\r\npretty women, selecting such as are not fond of cold-shouldering young\r\nmen. But that is not the point, only this lady, noting my fixed gaze,\r\nbent down to her neighbour and with a simper whispered something in her\r\near. The blonde lady turned at once, and I remember that her glowing\r\neyes so flashed upon me in the half dark, that, not prepared to meet\r\nthem, I started as though I were scalded. The beauty smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Do you like what they are acting?\" she asked, looking into my face with\r\na shy and mocking expression.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I answered, still gazing at her with a sort of wonder that\r\nevidently pleased her.\r\n\r\n\"But why are you standing? You'll get tired. Can't you find a seat?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just it, I can't,\" I answered, more occupied with my grievance\r\nthan with the beauty's sparkling eyes, and rejoicing in earnest at\r\nhaving found a kind heart to whom I could confide my troubles. \"I have\r\nlooked everywhere, but all the chairs are taken,\" I added, as though\r\ncomplaining to her that all the chairs were taken.\r\n\r\n\"Come here,\" she said briskly, quick to act on every decision, and,\r\nindeed, on every mad idea that flashed on her giddy brain, \"come here,\r\nand sit on my knee.\"\r\n\r\n\"On your knee,\" I repeated, taken aback. I have mentioned already that I\r\nhad begun to resent the privileges of childhood and to be ashamed of\r\nthem in earnest. This lady, as though in derision, had gone ever so much\r\nfurther than the others. Moreover, I had always been a shy and bashful\r\nboy, and of late had begun to be particularly shy with women.\r\n\r\n\"Why yes, on my knee. Why don't you want to sit on my knee?\" she\r\npersisted, beginning to laugh more and more, so that at last she was\r\nsimply giggling, goodness knows at what, perhaps at her freak, or\r\nperhaps at my confusion. But that was just what she wanted.\r\n\r\nI flushed, and in my confusion looked round trying to find where to\r\nescape; but seeing my intention she managed to catch hold of my hand to\r\nprevent me from going away, and pulling it towards her, suddenly, quite\r\nunexpectedly, to my intense astonishment, squeezed it in her mischievous\r\nwarm fingers, and began to pinch my fingers till they hurt so much that\r\nI had to do my very utmost not to cry out, and in my effort to control\r\nmyself made the most absurd grimaces. I was, besides, moved to the\r\ngreatest amazement, perplexity, and even horror, at the discovery that\r\nthere were ladies so absurd and spiteful as to talk nonsense to boys,\r\nand even pinch their fingers, for no earthly reason and before\r\neverybody. Probably my unhappy face reflected my bewilderment, for the\r\nmischievous creature laughed in my face, as though she were crazy, and\r\nmeantime she was pinching my fingers more and more vigorously. She was\r\nhighly delighted in playing such a mischievous prank and completely\r\nmystifying and embarrassing a poor boy. My position was desperate. In\r\nthe first place I was hot with shame, because almost every one near had\r\nturned round to look at us, some in wonder, others with laughter,\r\ngrasping at once that the beauty was up to some mischief. I dreadfully\r\nwanted to scream, too, for she was wringing my fingers with positive\r\nfury just because I didn't scream; while I, like a Spartan, made up my\r\nmind to endure the agony, afraid by crying out of causing a general\r\nfuss, which was more than I could face. In utter despair I began at last\r\nstruggling with her, trying with all my might to pull away my hand, but\r\nmy persecutor was much stronger than I was. At last I could bear it no\r\nlonger, and uttered a shriek--that was all she was waiting for!\r\nInstantly she let me go, and turned away as though nothing had happened,\r\nas though it was not she who had played the trick but some one else,\r\nexactly like some schoolboy who, as soon as the master's back is turned,\r\nplays some trick on some one near him, pinches some small weak boy,\r\ngives him a flip, a kick, or a nudge with his elbows, and instantly\r\nturns again, buries himself in his book and begins repeating his lesson,\r\nand so makes a fool of the infuriated teacher who flies down like a hawk\r\nat the noise.\r\n\r\nBut luckily for me the general attention was distracted at the moment by\r\nthe masterly acting of our host, who was playing the chief part in the\r\nperformance, some comedy of Scribe's. Every one began to applaud; under\r\ncover of the noise I stole away and hurried to the furthest end of the\r\nroom, from which, concealed behind a column, I looked with horror\r\ntowards the place where the treacherous beauty was sitting. She was\r\nstill laughing, holding her handkerchief to her lips. And for a long\r\ntime she was continually turning round, looking for me in every\r\ndirection, probably regretting that our silly tussle was so soon over,\r\nand hatching some other trick to play on me.\r\n\r\nThat was the beginning of our acquaintance, and from that evening she\r\nwould never let me alone. She persecuted me without consideration or\r\nconscience, she became my tyrant and tormentor. The whole absurdity of\r\nher jokes with me lay in the fact that she pretended to be head over\r\nears in love with me, and teased me before every one. Of course for a\r\nwild creature as I was all this was so tiresome and vexatious that it\r\nalmost reduced me to tears, and I was sometimes put in such a difficult\r\nposition that I was on the point of fighting with my treacherous\r\nadmirer. My naive confusion, my desperate distress, seemed to egg her on\r\nto persecute me more; she knew no mercy, while I did not know how to get\r\naway from her. The laughter which always accompanied us, and which she\r\nknew so well how to excite, roused her to fresh pranks. But at last\r\npeople began to think that she went a little too far in her jests. And,\r\nindeed, as I remember now, she did take outrageous liberties with a\r\nchild such as I was.\r\n\r\nBut that was her character; she was a spoilt child in every respect. I\r\nheard afterwards that her husband, a very short, very fat, and very\r\nred-faced man, very rich and apparently very much occupied with\r\nbusiness, spoilt her more than any one. Always busy and flying round, he\r\ncould not stay two hours in one place. Every day he drove into Moscow,\r\nsometimes twice in the day, and always, as he declared himself, on\r\nbusiness. It would be hard to find a livelier and more good-natured face\r\nthan his facetious but always well-bred countenance. He not only loved\r\nhis wife to the point of weakness, softness: he simply worshipped her\r\nlike an idol.\r\n\r\nHe did not restrain her in anything. She had masses of friends, male and\r\nfemale. In the first place, almost everybody liked her; and secondly,\r\nthe feather-headed creature was not herself over particular in the\r\nchoice of her friends, though there was a much more serious foundation\r\nto her character than might be supposed from what I have just said about\r\nher. But of all her friends she liked best of all one young lady, a\r\ndistant relation, who was also of our party now. There existed between\r\nthem a tender and subtle affection, one of those attachments which\r\nsometimes spring up at the meeting of two dispositions often the very\r\nopposite of each other, of which one is deeper, purer and more austere,\r\nwhile the other, with lofty humility, and generous self-criticism,\r\nlovingly gives way to the other, conscious of the friend's superiority\r\nand cherishing the friendship as a happiness. Then begins that tender\r\nand noble subtlety in the relations of such characters, love and\r\ninfinite indulgence on the one side, on the other love and respect--a\r\nrespect approaching awe, approaching anxiety as to the impression made\r\non the friend so highly prized, and an eager, jealous desire to get\r\ncloser and closer to that friend's heart in every step in life.\r\n\r\nThese two friends were of the same age, but there was an immense\r\ndifference between them in everything--in looks, to begin with. Madame\r\nM. was also very handsome, but there was something special in her beauty\r\nthat strikingly distinguished her from the crowd of pretty women; there\r\nwas something in her face that at once drew the affection of all to her,\r\nor rather, which aroused a generous and lofty feeling of kindliness in\r\nevery one who met her. There are such happy faces. At her side everyone\r\ngrew as it were better, freer, more cordial; and yet her big mournful\r\neyes, full of fire and vigour, had a timid and anxious look, as though\r\nevery minute dreading something antagonistic and menacing, and this\r\nstrange timidity at times cast so mournful a shade over her mild, gentle\r\nfeatures which recalled the serene faces of Italian Madonnas, that\r\nlooking at her one soon became oneself sad, as though for some trouble\r\nof one's own. The pale, thin face, in which, through the irreproachable\r\nbeauty of the pure, regular lines and the mournful severity of some mute\r\nhidden grief, there often flitted the clear looks of early childhood,\r\ntelling of trustful years and perhaps simple-hearted happiness in the\r\nrecent past, the gentle but diffident, hesitating smile, all aroused\r\nsuch unaccountable sympathy for her that every heart was unconsciously\r\nstirred with a sweet and warm anxiety that powerfully interceded on her\r\nbehalf even at a distance, and made even strangers feel akin to her. But\r\nthe lovely creature seemed silent and reserved, though no one could have\r\nbeen more attentive and loving if any one needed sympathy. There are\r\nwomen who are like sisters of mercy in life. Nothing can be hidden from\r\nthem, nothing, at least, that is a sore or wound of the heart. Any one\r\nwho is suffering may go boldly and hopefully to them without fear of\r\nbeing a burden, for few men know the infinite patience of love,\r\ncompassion and forgiveness that may be found in some women's hearts.\r\nPerfect treasures of sympathy, consolation and hope are laid up in these\r\npure hearts, so often full of suffering of their own--for a heart which\r\nloves much grieves much--though their wounds are carefully hidden from\r\nthe curious eye, for deep sadness is most often mute and concealed. They\r\nare not dismayed by the depth of the wound, nor by its foulness and its\r\nstench; any one who comes to them is deserving of help; they are, as it\r\nwere, born for heroism.... Mme. M. was tall, supple and graceful, but\r\nrather thin. All her movements seemed somehow irregular, at times slow,\r\nsmooth, and even dignified, at times childishly hasty; and yet, at the\r\nsame time, there was a sort of timid humility in her gestures, something\r\ntremulous and defenceless, though it neither desired nor asked for\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned already that the outrageous teasing of the treacherous\r\nfair lady abashed me, flabbergasted me, and wounded me to the quick. But\r\nthere was for that another secret, strange and foolish reason, which I\r\nconcealed, at which I shuddered as at a skeleton. At the very thought of\r\nit, brooding, utterly alone and overwhelmed, in some dark mysterious\r\ncorner to which the inquisitorial mocking eye of the blue-eyed rogue\r\ncould not penetrate, I almost gasped with confusion, shame and fear--in\r\nshort, I was in love; that perhaps is nonsense, that could hardly have\r\nbeen. But why was it, of all the faces surrounding me, only her face\r\ncaught my attention? Why was it that it was only she whom I cared to\r\nfollow with my eyes, though I certainly had no inclination in those days\r\nto watch ladies and seek their acquaintance? This happened most\r\nfrequently on the evenings when we were all kept indoors by bad weather,\r\nand when, lonely, hiding in some corner of the big drawing-room, I\r\nstared about me aimlessly, unable to find anything to do, for except my\r\nteasing ladies, few people ever addressed me, and I was insufferably\r\nbored on such evenings. Then I stared at the people round me, listened\r\nto the conversation, of which I often did not understand one word, and\r\nat that time the mild eyes, the gentle smile and lovely face of Mme. M.\r\n(for she was the object of my passion) for some reason caught my\r\nfascinated attention; and the strange vague, but unutterably sweet\r\nimpression remained with me. Often for hours together I could not tear\r\nmyself away from her; I studied every gesture, every movement she made,\r\nlistened to every vibration of her rich, silvery, but rather muffled\r\nvoice; but strange to say, as the result of all my observations, I felt,\r\nmixed with a sweet and timid impression, a feeling of intense curiosity.\r\nIt seemed as though I were on the verge of some mystery.\r\n\r\nNothing distressed me so much as being mocked at in the presence of Mme.\r\nM. This mockery and humorous persecution, as I thought, humiliated me.\r\nAnd when there was a general burst of laughter at my expense, in which\r\nMme. M. sometimes could not help joining, in despair, beside myself with\r\nmisery, I used to tear myself from my tormentor and run away upstairs,\r\nwhere I remained in solitude the rest of the day, not daring to show my\r\nface in the drawing-room. I did not yet, however, understand my shame\r\nnor my agitation; the whole process went on in me unconsciously. I had\r\nhardly said two words to Mme. M., and indeed I should not have dared to.\r\nBut one evening after an unbearable day I turned back from an expedition\r\nwith the rest of the company. I was horribly tired and made my way home\r\nacross the garden. On a seat in a secluded avenue I saw Mme. M. She was\r\nsitting quite alone, as though she had purposely chosen this solitary\r\nspot, her head was drooping and she was mechanically twisting her\r\nhandkerchief. She was so lost in thought that she did not hear me till I\r\nreached her.\r\n\r\nNoticing me, she got up quickly from her seat, turned round, and I saw\r\nher hurriedly wipe her eyes with her handkerchief. She was crying.\r\nDrying her eyes, she smiled to me and walked back with me to the house.\r\nI don't remember what we talked about; but she frequently sent me off on\r\none pretext or another, to pick a flower, or to see who was riding in\r\nthe next avenue. And when I walked away from her, she at once put her\r\nhandkerchief to her eyes again and wiped away rebellious tears, which\r\nwould persist in rising again and again from her heart and dropping from\r\nher poor eyes. I realized that I was very much in her way when she sent\r\nme off so often, and, indeed, she saw herself that I noticed it all, but\r\nyet could not control herself, and that made my heart ache more and more\r\nfor her. I raged at myself at that moment and was almost in despair;\r\ncursed myself for my awkwardness and lack of resource, and at the same\r\ntime did not know how to leave her tactfully, without betraying that I\r\nhad noticed her distress, but walked beside her in mournful\r\nbewilderment, almost in alarm, utterly at a loss and unable to find a\r\nsingle word to keep up our scanty conversation.\r\n\r\nThis meeting made such an impression on me that I stealthily watched\r\nMme. M. the whole evening with eager curiosity, and never took my eyes\r\noff her. But it happened that she twice caught me unawares watching her,\r\nand on the second occasion, noticing me, she gave me a smile. It was the\r\nonly time she smiled that evening. The look of sadness had not left her\r\nface, which was now very pale. She spent the whole evening talking to an\r\nill-natured and quarrelsome old lady, whom nobody liked owing to her\r\nspying and backbiting habits, but of whom every one was afraid, and\r\nconsequently every one felt obliged to be polite to her....\r\n\r\nAt ten o'clock Mme. M.'s husband arrived. Till that moment I watched her\r\nvery attentively, never taking my eyes off her mournful face; now at the\r\nunexpected entrance of her husband I saw her start, and her pale face\r\nturned suddenly as white as a handkerchief. It was so noticeable that\r\nother people observed it. I overheard a fragmentary conversation from\r\nwhich I guessed that Mme. M. was not quite happy; they said her husband\r\nwas as jealous as an Arab, not from love, but from vanity. He was before\r\nall things a European, a modern man, who sampled the newest ideas and\r\nprided himself upon them. In appearance he was a tall, dark-haired,\r\nparticularly thick-set man, with European whiskers, with a\r\nself-satisfied, red face, with teeth white as sugar, and with an\r\nirreproachably gentlemanly deportment. He was called a _clever man_.\r\nSuch is the name given in certain circles to a peculiar species of\r\nmankind which grows fat at other people's expense, which does absolutely\r\nnothing and has no desire to do anything, and whose heart has turned\r\ninto a lump of fat from everlasting slothfulness and idleness. You\r\ncontinually hear from such men that there is nothing they can do owing\r\nto certain very complicated and hostile circumstances, which \"thwart\r\ntheir genius,\" and that it was \"sad to see the waste of their talents.\"\r\nThis is a fine phrase of theirs, their _mot d'ordre_, their watchword, a\r\nphrase which these well-fed, fat friends of ours bring out at every\r\nminute, so that it has long ago bored us as an arrant Tartuffism, an\r\nempty form of words. Some, however, of these amusing creatures, who\r\ncannot succeed in finding anything to do--though, indeed, they never\r\nseek it--try to make every one believe that they have not a lump of fat\r\nfor a heart, but on the contrary, something _very deep_, though what\r\nprecisely the greatest surgeon would hardly venture to decide--from\r\ncivility, of course. These gentlemen make their way in the world through\r\nthe fact that all their instincts are bent in the direction of coarse\r\nsneering, short-sighted censure and immense conceit. Since they have\r\nnothing else to do but note and emphasize the mistakes and weaknesses of\r\nothers, and as they have precisely as much good feeling as an oyster, it\r\nis not difficult for them with such powers of self-preservation to get\r\non with people fairly successfully. They pride themselves extremely upon\r\nthat. They are, for instance, as good as persuaded that almost the whole\r\nworld owes them something; that it is theirs, like an oyster which they\r\nkeep in reserve; that all are fools except themselves; that every one is\r\nlike an orange or a sponge, which they will squeeze as soon as they want\r\nthe juice; that they are the masters everywhere, and that all this\r\nacceptable state of affairs is solely due to the fact that they are\r\npeople of so much intellect and character. In their measureless conceit\r\nthey do not admit any defects in themselves, they are like that species\r\nof practical rogues, innate Tartuffes and Falstaffs, who are such\r\nthorough rogues that at last they have come to believe that that is as\r\nit should be, that is, that they should spend their lives in\r\nknavishness; they have so often assured every one that they are honest\r\nmen, that they have come to believe that they are honest men, and that\r\ntheir roguery is honesty. They are never capable of inner judgment\r\nbefore their conscience, of generous self-criticism; for some things\r\nthey are too fat. Their own priceless personality, their Baal and\r\nMoloch, their magnificent _ego_ is always in their foreground\r\neverywhere. All nature, the whole world for them is no more than a\r\nsplendid mirror created for the little god to admire himself continually\r\nin it, and to see no one and nothing behind himself; so it is not\r\nstrange that he sees everything in the world in such a hideous light. He\r\nhas a phrase in readiness for everything and--the acme of ingenuity on\r\nhis part--the most fashionable phrase. It is just these people, indeed,\r\nwho help to make the fashion, proclaiming at every cross-road an idea in\r\nwhich they scent success. A fine nose is just what they have for\r\nsniffing a fashionable phrase and making it their own before other\r\npeople get hold of it, so that it seems to have originated with them.\r\nThey have a particular store of phrases for proclaiming their profound\r\nsympathy for humanity, for defining what is the most correct and\r\nrational form of philanthropy, and continually attacking romanticism, in\r\nother words, everything fine and true, each atom of which is more\r\nprecious than all their mollusc tribe. But they are too coarse to\r\nrecognize the truth in an indirect, roundabout and unfinished form, and\r\nthey reject everything that is immature, still fermenting and unstable.\r\nThe well-nourished man has spent all his life in merry-making, with\r\neverything provided, has done nothing himself and does not know how hard\r\nevery sort of work is, and so woe betide you if you jar upon his fat\r\nfeelings by any sort of roughness; he'll never forgive you for that, he\r\nwill always remember it and will gladly avenge it. The long and short of\r\nit is, that my hero is neither more nor less than a gigantic, incredibly\r\nswollen bag, full of sentences, fashionable phrases, and labels of all\r\nsorts and kinds.\r\n\r\nM. M., however, had a speciality and was a very remarkable man; he was a\r\nwit, good talker and story-teller, and there was always a circle round\r\nhim in every drawing-room. That evening he was particularly successful\r\nin making an impression. He took possession of the conversation; he was\r\nin his best form, gay, pleased at something, and he compelled the\r\nattention of all; but Mme. M. looked all the time as though she were\r\nill; her face was so sad that I fancied every minute that tears would\r\nbegin quivering on her long eyelashes. All this, as I have said,\r\nimpressed me extremely and made me wonder. I went away with a feeling of\r\nstrange curiosity, and dreamed all night of M. M., though till then I\r\nhad rarely had dreams.\r\n\r\nNext day, early in the morning, I was summoned to a rehearsal of some\r\ntableaux vivants in which I had to take part. The tableaux vivants,\r\ntheatricals, and afterwards a dance were all fixed for the same evening,\r\nfive days later--the birthday of our host's younger daughter. To this\r\nentertainment, which was almost improvised, another hundred guests were\r\ninvited from Moscow and from surrounding villas, so that there was a\r\ngreat deal of fuss, bustle and commotion. The rehearsal, or rather\r\nreview of the costumes, was fixed so early in the morning because our\r\nmanager, a well-known artist, a friend of our host's, who had consented\r\nthrough affection for him to undertake the arrangement of the tableaux\r\nand the training of us for them, was in haste now to get to Moscow to\r\npurchase properties and to make final preparations for the fete, as\r\nthere was no time to lose. I took part in one tableau with Mme. M. It\r\nwas a scene from mediaeval life and was called \"The Lady of the Castle\r\nand Her Page.\"\r\n\r\nI felt unutterably confused on meeting Mme. M. at the rehearsal. I kept\r\nfeeling that she would at once read in my eyes all the reflections, the\r\ndoubts, the surmises, that had arisen in my mind since the previous day.\r\nI fancied, too, that I was, as it were, to blame in regard to her, for\r\nhaving come upon her tears the day before and hindered her grieving, so\r\nthat she could hardly help looking at me askance, as an unpleasant\r\nwitness and unforgiven sharer of her secret. But, thank goodness, it\r\nwent off without any great trouble; I was simply not noticed. I think\r\nshe had no thoughts to spare for me or for the rehearsal; she was\r\nabsent-minded, sad and gloomily thoughtful; it was evident that she was\r\nworried by some great anxiety. As soon as my part was over I ran away to\r\nchange my clothes, and ten minutes later came out on the verandah into\r\nthe garden. Almost at the same time Mme. M. came out by another door,\r\nand immediately afterwards coming towards us appeared her self-satisfied\r\nhusband, who was returning from the garden, after just escorting into it\r\nquite a crowd of ladies and there handing them over to a competent\r\n_cavaliere servente_. The meeting of the husband and wife was evidently\r\nunexpected. Mme. M., I don't know why, grew suddenly confused, and a\r\nfaint trace of vexation was betrayed in her impatient movement. The\r\nhusband, who had been carelessly whistling an air and with an air of\r\nprofundity stroking his whiskers, now, on meeting his wife, frowned and\r\nscrutinized her, as I remember now, with a markedly inquisitorial stare.\r\n\r\n\"You are going into the garden?\" he asked, noticing the parasol and book\r\nin her hand.\r\n\r\n\"No, into the copse,\" she said, with a slight flush.\r\n\r\n\"Alone?\"\r\n\r\n\"With him,\" said Mme. M., pointing to me. \"I always go a walk alone in\r\nthe morning,\" she added, speaking in an uncertain, hesitating voice, as\r\npeople do when they tell their first lie.\r\n\r\n\"H'm ... and I have just taken the whole party there. They have all met\r\nthere together in the flower arbour to see N. off. He is going away, you\r\nknow.... Something has gone wrong in Odessa. Your cousin\" (he meant the\r\nfair beauty) \"is laughing and crying at the same time; there is no\r\nmaking her out. She says, though, that you are angry with N. about\r\nsomething and so wouldn't go and see him off. Nonsense, of course?\"\r\n\r\n\"She's laughing,\" said Mme. M., coming down the verandah steps.\r\n\r\n\"So this is your daily _cavaliere servente_,\" added M. M., with a wry\r\nsmile, turning his lorgnette upon me.\r\n\r\n\"Page!\" I cried, angered by the lorgnette and the jeer; and laughing\r\nstraight in his face I jumped down the three steps of the verandah at\r\none bound.\r\n\r\n\"A pleasant walk,\" muttered M. M., and went on his way.\r\n\r\nOf course, I immediately joined Mme. M. as soon as she indicated me to\r\nher husband, and looked as though she had invited me to do so an hour\r\nbefore, and as though I had been accompanying her on her walks every\r\nmorning for the last month. But I could not make out why she was so\r\nconfused, so embarrassed, and what was in her mind when she brought\r\nherself to have recourse to her little lie? Why had she not simply said\r\nthat she was going alone? I did not know how to look at her, but\r\noverwhelmed with wonder I began by degrees very naively peeping into her\r\nface; but just as an hour before at the rehearsal she did not notice\r\neither my looks or my mute question. The same anxiety, only more intense\r\nand more distinct, was apparent in her face, in her agitation, in her\r\nwalk. She was in haste, and walked more and more quickly and kept\r\nlooking uneasily down every avenue, down every path in the wood that led\r\nin the direction of the garden. And I, too, was expecting something.\r\nSuddenly there was the sound of horses' hoofs behind us. It was the\r\nwhole party of ladies and gentlemen on horseback escorting N., the\r\ngentleman who was so suddenly deserting us.\r\n\r\nAmong the ladies was my fair tormentor, of whom M. M. had told us that\r\nshe was in tears. But characteristically she was laughing like a child,\r\nand was galloping briskly on a splendid bay horse. On reaching us N.\r\ntook off his hat, but did not stop, nor say one word to Mme. M. Soon all\r\nthe cavalcade disappeared from our sight. I glanced at Mme. M. and\r\nalmost cried out in wonder; she was standing as white as a handkerchief\r\nand big tears were gushing from her eyes. By chance our eyes met: Mme.\r\nM. suddenly flushed and turned away for an instant, and a distinct look\r\nof uneasiness and vexation flitted across her face. I was in the way,\r\nworse even than last time, that was clearer than day, but how was I to\r\nget away?\r\n\r\nAnd, as though guessing my difficulty, Mme. M. opened the book which she\r\nhad in her hand, and colouring and evidently trying not to look at me\r\nshe said, as though she had only suddenly realized it--\r\n\r\n\"Ah! It is the second part. I've made a mistake; please bring me the\r\nfirst.\"\r\n\r\nI could not but understand. My part was over, and I could not have been\r\nmore directly dismissed.\r\n\r\nI ran off with her book and did not come back. The first part lay\r\nundisturbed on the table that morning....\r\n\r\nBut I was not myself; in my heart there was a sort of haunting terror. I\r\ndid my utmost not to meet Mme. M. But I looked with wild curiosity at\r\nthe self-satisfied person of M. M., as though there must be something\r\nspecial about him now. I don't understand what was the meaning of my\r\nabsurd curiosity. I only remember that I was strangely perplexed by all\r\nthat I had chanced to see that morning. But the day was only just\r\nbeginning and it was fruitful in events for me.\r\n\r\nDinner was very early that day. An expedition to a neighbouring hamlet\r\nto see a village festival that was taking place there had been fixed for\r\nthe evening, and so it was necessary to be in time to get ready. I had\r\nbeen dreaming for the last three days of this excursion, anticipating\r\nall sorts of delights. Almost all the company gathered together on the\r\nverandah for coffee. I cautiously followed the others and concealed\r\nmyself behind the third row of chairs. I was attracted by curiosity, and\r\nyet I was very anxious not to be seen by Mme. M. But as luck would have\r\nit I was not far from my fair tormentor. Something miraculous and\r\nincredible was happening to her that day; she looked twice as handsome.\r\nI don't know how and why this happens, but such miracles are by no means\r\nrare with women. There was with us at this moment a new guest, a tall,\r\npale-faced young man, the official admirer of our fair beauty, who had\r\njust arrived from Moscow as though on purpose to replace N., of whom\r\nrumour said that he was desperately in love with the same lady. As for\r\nthe newly arrived guest, he had for a long time past been on the same\r\nterms as Benedick with Beatrice, in Shakespeare's _Much Ado about\r\nNothing_. In short, the fair beauty was in her very best form that day.\r\nHer chatter and her jests were so full of grace, so trustfully naive, so\r\ninnocently careless, she was persuaded of the general enthusiasm with\r\nsuch graceful self-confidence that she really was all the time the\r\ncentre of peculiar adoration. A throng of surprised and admiring\r\nlisteners was continually round her, and she had never been so\r\nfascinating. Every word she uttered was marvellous and seductive, was\r\ncaught up and handed round in the circle, and not one word, one jest,\r\none sally was lost. I fancy no one had expected from her such taste,\r\nsuch brilliance, such wit. Her best qualities were, as a rule, buried\r\nunder the most harum-scarum wilfulness, the most schoolboyish pranks,\r\nalmost verging on buffoonery; they were rarely noticed, and, when they\r\nwere, were hardly believed in, so that now her extraordinary brilliancy\r\nwas accompanied by an eager whisper of amazement among all. There was,\r\nhowever, one peculiar and rather delicate circumstance, judging at least\r\nby the part in it played by Mme. M.'s husband, which contributed to her\r\nsuccess. The madcap ventured--and I must add to the satisfaction of\r\nalmost every one or, at any rate, to the satisfaction of all the young\r\npeople--to make a furious attack upon him, owing to many causes,\r\nprobably of great consequence in her eyes. She carried on with him a\r\nregular cross-fire of witticisms, of mocking and sarcastic sallies, of\r\nthat most illusive and treacherous kind that, smoothly wrapped up on the\r\nsurface, hit the mark without giving the victim anything to lay hold of,\r\nand exhaust him in fruitless efforts to repel the attack, reducing him\r\nto fury and comic despair.\r\n\r\nI don't know for certain, but I fancy the whole proceeding was not\r\nimprovised but premeditated. This desperate duel had begun earlier, at\r\ndinner. I call it desperate because M. M. was not quick to surrender. He\r\nhad to call upon all his presence of mind, all his sharp wit and rare\r\nresourcefulness not to be completely covered with ignominy. The conflict\r\nwas accompanied by the continual and irrepressible laughter of all who\r\nwitnessed and took part in it. That day was for him very different from\r\nthe day before. It was noticeable that Mme. M. several times did her\r\nutmost to stop her indiscreet friend, who was certainly trying to depict\r\nthe jealous husband in the most grotesque and absurd guise, in the guise\r\nof \"a bluebeard\" it must be supposed, judging from all probabilities,\r\nfrom what has remained in my memory and finally from the part which I\r\nmyself was destined to play in the affair.\r\n\r\nI was drawn into it in a most absurd manner, quite unexpectedly. And as\r\nill-luck would have it at that moment I was standing where I could be\r\nseen, suspecting no evil and actually forgetting the precautions I had\r\nso long practised. Suddenly I was brought into the foreground as a sworn\r\nfoe and natural rival of M. M., as desperately in love with his wife, of\r\nwhich my persecutress vowed and swore that she had proofs, saying that\r\nonly that morning she had seen in the copse....\r\n\r\nBut before she had time to finish I broke in at the most desperate\r\nminute. That minute was so diabolically calculated, was so treacherously\r\nprepared to lead up to its finale, its ludicrous _denouement_, and was\r\nbrought out with such killing humour that a perfect outburst of\r\nirrepressible mirth saluted this last sally. And though even at the time\r\nI guessed that mine was not the most unpleasant part in the performance,\r\nyet I was so confused, so irritated and alarmed that, full of misery and\r\ndespair, gasping with shame and tears, I dashed through two rows of\r\nchairs, stepped forward, and addressing my tormentor, cried, in a voice\r\nbroken with tears and indignation:\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you ashamed ... aloud ... before all the ladies ... to tell such\r\na wicked ... lie?... Like a small child ... before all these men....\r\nWhat will they say?... A big girl like you ... and married!...\"\r\n\r\nBut I could not go on, there was a deafening roar of applause. My\r\noutburst created a perfect furore. My naive gesture, my tears, and\r\nespecially the fact that I seemed to be defending M. M., all this\r\nprovoked such fiendish laughter, that even now I cannot help laughing at\r\nthe mere recollection of it. I was overcome with confusion, senseless\r\nwith horror and, burning with shame, hiding my face in my hands rushed\r\naway, knocked a tray out of the hands of a footman who was coming in at\r\nthe door, and flew upstairs to my own room. I pulled out the key, which\r\nwas on the outside of the door, and locked myself in. I did well, for\r\nthere was a hue and cry after me. Before a minute had passed my door was\r\nbesieged by a mob of the prettiest ladies. I heard their ringing\r\nlaughter, their incessant chatter, their trilling voices; they were all\r\ntwittering at once, like swallows. All of them, every one of them,\r\nbegged and besought me to open the door, if only for a moment; swore\r\nthat no harm should come to me, only that they wanted to smother me with\r\nkisses. But ... what could be more horrible than this novel threat? I\r\nsimply burned with shame the other side of the door, hiding my face in\r\nthe pillows and did not open, did not even respond. The ladies kept up\r\ntheir knocking for a long time, but I was deaf and obdurate as only a\r\nboy of eleven could be.\r\n\r\nBut what could I do now? Everything was laid bare, everything had been\r\nexposed, everything I had so jealously guarded and concealed!...\r\nEverlasting disgrace and shame had fallen on me! But it is true that I\r\ncould not myself have said why I was frightened and what I wanted to\r\nhide; yet I was frightened of something and had trembled like a leaf at\r\nthe thought of _that something's_ being discovered. Only till that\r\nminute I had not known what it was: whether it was good or bad, splendid\r\nor shameful, praiseworthy or reprehensible? Now in my distress, in the\r\nmisery that had been forced upon me, I learned that it was _absurd_ and\r\n_shameful_. Instinctively I felt at the same time that this verdict was\r\nfalse, inhuman, and coarse; but I was crushed, annihilated;\r\nconsciousness seemed checked in me and thrown into confusion; I could\r\nnot stand up against that verdict, nor criticize it properly. I was\r\nbefogged; I only felt that my heart had been inhumanly and shamelessly\r\nwounded, and was brimming over with impotent tears. I was irritated; but\r\nI was boiling with indignation and hate such as I had never felt before,\r\nfor it was the first time in my life that I had known real sorrow,\r\ninsult, and injury--and it was truly that, without any exaggeration. The\r\nfirst untried, unformed feeling had been so coarsely handled in me, a\r\nchild. The first fragrant, virginal modesty had been so soon exposed and\r\ninsulted, and the first and perhaps very real and aesthetic impression\r\nhad been so outraged. Of course there was much my persecutors did not\r\nknow and did not divine in my sufferings. One circumstance, which I had\r\nnot succeeded in analysing till then, of which I had been as it were\r\nafraid, partly entered into it. I went on lying on my bed in despair and\r\nmisery, hiding my face in my pillow, and I was alternately feverish and\r\nshivery. I was tormented by two questions: first, what had the wretched\r\nfair beauty seen, and, in fact, what could she have seen that morning in\r\nthe copse between Mme. M. and me? And secondly, how could I now look\r\nMme. M. in the face without dying on the spot of shame and despair?\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary noise in the yard roused me at last from the state of\r\nsemi-consciousness into which I had fallen. I got up and went to the\r\nwindow. The whole yard was packed with carriages, saddle-horses, and\r\nbustling servants. It seemed that they were all setting off; some of the\r\ngentlemen had already mounted their horses, others were taking their\r\nplaces in the carriages.... Then I remembered the expedition to the\r\nvillage fete, and little by little an uneasiness came over me; I began\r\nanxiously looking for my pony in the yard; but there was no pony there,\r\nso they must have forgotten me. I could not restrain myself, and rushed\r\nheadlong downstairs, thinking no more of unpleasant meetings or my\r\nrecent ignominy....\r\n\r\nTerrible news awaited me. There was neither a horse nor seat in any of\r\nthe carriages to spare for me; everything had been arranged, all the\r\nseats were taken, and I was forced to give place to others. Overwhelmed\r\nby this fresh blow, I stood on the steps and looked mournfully at the\r\nlong rows of coaches, carriages, and chaises, in which there was not the\r\ntiniest corner left for me, and at the smartly dressed ladies, whose\r\nhorses were restlessly curvetting.\r\n\r\nOne of the gentlemen was late. They were only waiting for his arrival to\r\nset off. His horse was standing at the door, champing the bit, pawing\r\nthe earth with his hoofs, and at every moment starting and rearing. Two\r\nstable-boys were carefully holding him by the bridle, and every one else\r\napprehensively stood at a respectful distance from him.\r\n\r\nA most vexatious circumstance had occurred, which prevented my going. In\r\naddition to the fact that new visitors had arrived, filling up all the\r\nseats, two of the horses had fallen ill, one of them being my pony. But\r\nI was not the only person to suffer: it appeared that there was no horse\r\nfor our new visitor, the pale-faced young man of whom I have spoken\r\nalready. To get over this difficulty our host had been obliged to have\r\nrecourse to the extreme step of offering his fiery unbroken stallion,\r\nadding, to satisfy his conscience, that it was impossible to ride him,\r\nand that they had long intended to sell the beast for its vicious\r\ncharacter, if only a purchaser could be found.\r\n\r\nBut, in spite of his warning, the visitor declared that he was a good\r\nhorseman, and in any case ready to mount anything rather than not go.\r\nOur host said no more, but now I fancied that a sly and ambiguous smile\r\nwas straying on his lips. He waited for the gentleman who had spoken so\r\nwell of his own horsemanship, and stood, without mounting his horse,\r\nimpatiently rubbing his hands and continually glancing towards the door;\r\nsome similar feeling seemed shared by the two stable-boys, who were\r\nholding the stallion, almost breathless with pride at seeing themselves\r\nbefore the whole company in charge of a horse which might any minute\r\nkill a man for no reason whatever. Something akin to their master's sly\r\nsmile gleamed, too, in their eyes, which were round with expectation,\r\nand fixed upon the door from which the bold visitor was to appear. The\r\nhorse himself, too, behaved as though he were in league with our host\r\nand the stable-boys. He bore himself proudly and haughtily, as though he\r\nfelt that he were being watched by several dozen curious eyes and were\r\nglorying in his evil reputation exactly as some incorrigible rogue might\r\nglory in his criminal exploits. He seemed to be defying the bold man who\r\nwould venture to curb his independence.\r\n\r\nThat bold man did at last make his appearance. Conscience-stricken at\r\nhaving kept every one waiting, hurriedly drawing on his gloves, he came\r\nforward without looking at anything, ran down the steps, and only raised\r\nhis eyes as he stretched out his hand to seize the mane of the waiting\r\nhorse. But he was at once disconcerted by his frantic rearing and a\r\nwarning scream from the frightened spectators. The young man stepped\r\nback and looked in perplexity at the vicious horse, which was quivering\r\nall over, snorting with anger, and rolling his bloodshot eyes\r\nferociously, continually rearing on his hind legs and flinging up his\r\nfore legs as though he meant to bolt into the air and carry the two\r\nstable-boys with him. For a minute the young man stood completely\r\nnonplussed; then, flushing slightly with some embarrassment, he raised\r\nhis eyes and looked at the frightened ladies.\r\n\r\n\"A very fine horse!\" he said, as though to himself, \"and to my thinking\r\nit ought to be a great pleasure to ride him; but ... but do you know, I\r\nthink I won't go?\" he concluded, turning to our host with the broad,\r\ngood-natured smile which so suited his kind and clever face.\r\n\r\n\"Yet I consider you are an excellent horseman, I assure you,\" answered\r\nthe owner of the unapproachable horse, delighted, and he warmly and even\r\ngratefully pressed the young man's hand, \"just because from the first\r\nmoment you saw the sort of brute you had to deal with,\" he added with\r\ndignity. \"Would you believe me, though I have served twenty-three years\r\nin the hussars, yet I've had the pleasure of being laid on the ground\r\nthree times, thanks to that beast, that is, as often as I mounted the\r\nuseless animal. Tancred, my boy, there's no one here fit for you! Your\r\nrider, it seems, must be some Ilya Muromets, and he must be sitting\r\nquiet now in the village of Kapatcharovo, waiting for your teeth to fall\r\nout. Come, take him away, he has frightened people enough. It was a\r\nwaste of time to bring him out,\" he cried, rubbing his hands\r\ncomplacently.\r\n\r\nIt must be observed that Tancred was no sort of use to his master and\r\nsimply ate corn for nothing; moreover, the old hussar had lost his\r\nreputation for a knowledge of horseflesh by paying a fabulous sum for\r\nthe worthless beast, which he had purchased only for his beauty ... yet\r\nhe was delighted now that Tancred had kept up his reputation, had\r\ndisposed of another rider, and so had drawn closer on himself fresh\r\nsenseless laurels.\r\n\r\n\"So you are not going?\" cried the blonde beauty, who was particularly\r\nanxious that her _cavaliere servente_ should be in attendance on this\r\noccasion. \"Surely you are not frightened?\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon my word I am,\" answered the young man.\r\n\r\n\"Are you in earnest?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, do you want me to break my neck?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then make haste and get on my horse; don't be afraid, it is very quiet.\r\nWe won't delay them, they can change the saddles in a minute! I'll try\r\nto take yours. Surely Tancred can't always be so unruly.\"\r\n\r\nNo sooner said than done, the madcap leaped out of the saddle and was\r\nstanding before us as she finished the last sentence.\r\n\r\n\"You don't know Tancred, if you think he will allow your wretched\r\nside-saddle to be put on him! Besides, I would not let you break your\r\nneck, it would be a pity!\" said our host, at that moment of inward\r\ngratification affecting, as his habit was, a studied brusqueness and\r\neven coarseness of speech which he thought in keeping with a jolly good\r\nfellow and an old soldier, and which he imagined to be particularly\r\nattractive to the ladies. This was one of his favourite fancies, his\r\nfavourite whim, with which we were all familiar.\r\n\r\n\"Well, cry-baby, wouldn't you like to have a try? You wanted so much to\r\ngo?\" said the valiant horsewoman, noticing me and pointing tauntingly at\r\nTancred, because I had been so imprudent as to catch her eye, and she\r\nwould not let me go without a biting word, that she might not have\r\ndismounted from her horse absolutely for nothing.\r\n\r\n\"I expect you are not such a---- We all know you are a hero and would be\r\nashamed to be afraid; especially when you will be looked at, you fine\r\npage,\" she added, with a fleeting glance at Mme. M., whose carriage was\r\nthe nearest to the entrance.\r\n\r\nA rush of hatred and vengeance had flooded my heart, when the fair\r\nAmazon had approached us with the intention of mounting Tancred.... But\r\nI cannot describe what I felt at this unexpected challenge from the\r\nmadcap. Everything was dark before my eyes when I saw her glance at Mme.\r\nM. For an instant an idea flashed through my mind ... but it was only a\r\nmoment, less than a moment, like a flash of gunpowder; perhaps it was\r\nthe last straw, and I suddenly now was moved to rage as my spirit rose,\r\nso that I longed to put all my enemies to utter confusion, and to\r\nrevenge myself on all of them and before everyone, by showing the sort\r\nof person I was. Or whether by some miracle, some prompting from\r\nmediaeval history, of which I had known nothing till then, sent whirling\r\nthrough my giddy brain, images of tournaments, paladins, heroes, lovely\r\nladies, the clash of swords, shouts and the applause of the crowd, and\r\namidst those shouts the timid cry of a frightened heart, which moves the\r\nproud soul more sweetly than victory and fame--I don't know whether all\r\nthis romantic nonsense was in my head at the time, or whether, more\r\nlikely, only the first dawning of the inevitable nonsense that was in\r\nstore for me in the future, anyway, I felt that my hour had come. My\r\nheart leaped and shuddered, and I don't remember how, at one bound, I\r\nwas down the steps and beside Tancred.\r\n\r\n\"You think I am afraid?\" I cried, boldly and proudly, in such a fever\r\nthat I could hardly see, breathless with excitement, and flushing till\r\nthe tears scalded my cheeks. \"Well, you shall see!\" And clutching at\r\nTancred's mane I put my foot in the stirrup before they had time to make\r\na movement to stop me; but at that instant Tancred reared, jerked his\r\nhead, and with a mighty bound forward wrenched himself out of the hands\r\nof the petrified stable-boys, and dashed off like a hurricane, while\r\nevery one cried out in horror.\r\n\r\nGoodness knows how I got my other leg over the horse while it was in\r\nfull gallop; I can't imagine, either, how I did not lose hold of the\r\nreins. Tancred bore me beyond the trellis gate, turned sharply to the\r\nright and flew along beside the fence regardless of the road. Only at\r\nthat moment I heard behind me a shout from fifty voices, and that shout\r\nwas echoed in my swooning heart with such a feeling of pride and\r\npleasure that I shall never forget that mad moment of my boyhood. All\r\nthe blood rushed to my head, bewildering me and overpowering my fears. I\r\nwas beside myself. There certainly was, as I remember it now, something\r\nof the knight-errant about the exploit.\r\n\r\nMy knightly exploits, however, were all over in an instant or it would\r\nhave gone badly with the knight. And, indeed, I do not know how I\r\nescaped as it was. I did know how to ride, I had been taught. But my\r\npony was more like a sheep than a riding horse. No doubt I should have\r\nbeen thrown off Tancred if he had had time to throw me, but after\r\ngalloping fifty paces he suddenly took fright at a huge stone which lay\r\nacross the road and bolted back. He turned sharply, galloping at full\r\nspeed, so that it is a puzzle to me even now that I was not sent\r\nspinning out of the saddle and flying like a ball for twenty feet, that\r\nI was not dashed to pieces, and that Tancred did not dislocate his leg\r\nby such a sudden turn. He rushed back to the gate, tossing his head\r\nfuriously, bounding from side to side as though drunk with rage,\r\nflinging his legs at random in the air, and at every leap trying to\r\nshake me off his back as though a tiger had leaped on him and were\r\nthrusting its teeth and claws into his back.\r\n\r\nIn another instant I should have flown off; I was falling; but several\r\ngentlemen flew to my rescue. Two of them intercepted the way into the\r\nopen country, two others galloped up, closing in upon Tancred so that\r\ntheir horses' sides almost crushed my legs, and both of them caught him\r\nby the bridle. A few seconds later we were back at the steps.\r\n\r\nThey lifted me down from the horse, pale and scarcely breathing. I was\r\nshaking like a blade of grass in the wind; it was the same with Tancred,\r\nwho was standing, his hoofs as it were thrust into the earth and his\r\nwhole body thrown back, puffing his fiery breath from red and streaming\r\nnostrils, twitching and quivering all over, seeming overwhelmed with\r\nwounded pride and anger at a child's being so bold with impunity. All\r\naround me I heard cries of bewilderment, surprise, and alarm.\r\n\r\nAt that moment my straying eyes caught those of Mme. M., who looked pale\r\nand agitated, and--I can never forget that moment--in one instant my\r\nface was flooded with colour, glowed and burned like fire; I don't know\r\nwhat happened to me, but confused and frightened by my own feelings I\r\ntimidly dropped my eyes to the ground. But my glance was noticed, it was\r\ncaught, it was stolen from me. All eyes turned on Mme. M., and finding\r\nherself unawares the centre of attention, she, too, flushed like a child\r\nfrom some naive and involuntary feeling and made an unsuccessful effort\r\nto cover her confusion by laughing....\r\n\r\nAll this, of course, was very absurd-looking from outside, but at that\r\nmoment an extremely naive and unexpected circumstance saved me from\r\nbeing laughed at by every one, and gave a special colour to the whole\r\nadventure. The lovely persecutor who was the instigator of the whole\r\nescapade, and who till then had been my irreconcileable foe, suddenly\r\nrushed up to embrace and kiss me. She had hardly been able to believe\r\nher eyes when she saw me dare to accept her challenge, and pick up the\r\ngauntlet she had flung at me by glancing at Mme. M. She had almost died\r\nof terror and self-reproach when I had flown off on Tancred; now, when\r\nit was all over, and particularly when she caught the glance at Mme. M.,\r\nmy confusion and my sudden flush of colour, when the romantic strain in\r\nher frivolous little head had given a new secret, unspoken significance\r\nto the moment--she was moved to such enthusiasm over my \"knightliness,\"\r\nthat touched, joyful and proud of me, she rushed up and pressed me to\r\nher bosom. She lifted the most naive, stern-looking little face, on\r\nwhich there quivered and gleamed two little crystal tears, and gazing at\r\nthe crowd that thronged about her said in a grave, earnest voice, such\r\nas they had never heard her use before, pointing to me: \"Mais c'est tres\r\nserieux, messieurs, ne riez pas!\" She did not notice that all were\r\nstanding, as though fascinated, admiring her bright enthusiasm. Her\r\nswift, unexpected action, her earnest little face, the simple-hearted\r\nnaivete, the unexpected feeling betrayed by the tears that welled in her\r\ninvariably laughter-loving eyes, were such a surprise that every one\r\nstood before her as though electrified by her expression, her rapid,\r\nfiery words and gestures. It seemed as though no one could take his eyes\r\noff her for fear of missing that rare moment in her enthusiastic face.\r\nEven our host flushed crimson as a tulip, and people declared that they\r\nheard him confess afterwards that \"to his shame\" he had been in love for\r\na whole minute with his charming guest. Well, of course, after this I\r\nwas a knight, a hero.\r\n\r\n\"De Lorge! Toggenburg!\" was heard in the crowd.\r\n\r\nThere was a sound of applause.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah for the rising generation!\" added the host.\r\n\r\n\"But he is coming with us, he certainly must come with us,\" said the\r\nbeauty; \"we will find him a place, we must find him a place. He shall\r\nsit beside me, on my knee ... but no, no! That's a mistake!...\" she\r\ncorrected herself, laughing, unable to restrain her mirth at our first\r\nencounter. But as she laughed she stroked my hand tenderly, doing all\r\nshe could to soften me, that I might not be offended.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, of course,\" several voices chimed in; \"he must go, he has\r\nwon his place.\"\r\n\r\nThe matter was settled in a trice. The same old maid who had brought\r\nabout my acquaintance with the blonde beauty was at once besieged with\r\nentreaties from all the younger people to remain at home and let me have\r\nher seat. She was forced to consent, to her intense vexation, with a\r\nsmile and a stealthy hiss of anger. Her protectress, who was her usual\r\nrefuge, my former foe and new friend, called to her as she galloped off\r\non her spirited horse, laughing like a child, that she envied her and\r\nwould have been glad to stay at home herself, for it was just going to\r\nrain and we should all get soaked.\r\n\r\nAnd she was right in predicting rain. A regular downpour came on within\r\nan hour and the expedition was done for. We had to take shelter for some\r\nhours in the huts of the village, and had to return home between nine\r\nand ten in the evening in the damp mist that followed the rain. I began\r\nto be a little feverish. At the minute when I was starting, Mme. M. came\r\nup to me and expressed surprise that my neck was uncovered and that I\r\nhad nothing on over my jacket. I answered that I had not had time to get\r\nmy coat. She took out a pin and pinned up the turned down collar of my\r\nshirt, took off her own neck a crimson gauze kerchief, and put it round\r\nmy neck that I might not get a sore throat. She did this so hurriedly\r\nthat I had not time even to thank her.\r\n\r\nBut when we got home I found her in the little drawing-room with the\r\nblonde beauty and the pale-faced young man who had gained glory for\r\nhorsemanship that day by refusing to ride Tancred. I went up to thank\r\nher and give back the scarf. But now, after all my adventures, I felt\r\nsomehow ashamed. I wanted to make haste and get upstairs, there at my\r\nleisure to reflect and consider. I was brimming over with impressions.\r\nAs I gave back the kerchief I blushed up to my ears, as usual.\r\n\r\n\"I bet he would like to keep the kerchief,\" said the young man laughing.\r\n\"One can see that he is sorry to part with your scarf.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it, that's it!\" the fair lady put in. \"What a boy! Oh!\" she\r\nsaid, shaking her head with obvious vexation, but she stopped in time at\r\na grave glance from Mme. M., who did not want to carry the jest too far.\r\n\r\nI made haste to get away.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you are a boy,\" said the madcap, overtaking me in the next room\r\nand affectionately taking me by both hands, \"why, you should have simply\r\nnot returned the kerchief if you wanted so much to have it. You should\r\nhave said you put it down somewhere, and that would have been the end of\r\nit. What a simpleton! Couldn't even do that! What a funny boy!\"\r\n\r\nAnd she tapped me on the chin with her finger, laughing at my having\r\nflushed as red as a poppy.\r\n\r\n\"I am your friend now, you know; am I not? Our enmity is over, isn't it?\r\nYes or no?\"\r\n\r\nI laughed and pressed her fingers without a word.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, why are you so ... why are you so pale and shivering? Have you\r\ncaught a chill?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I don't feel well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, poor fellow! That's the result of over-excitement. Do you know\r\nwhat? You had better go to bed without sitting up for supper, and you\r\nwill be all right in the morning. Come along.\"\r\n\r\nShe took me upstairs, and there was no end to the care she lavished on\r\nme. Leaving me to undress she ran downstairs, got me some tea, and\r\nbrought it up herself when I was in bed. She brought me up a warm quilt\r\nas well. I was much impressed and touched by all the care and attention\r\nlavished on me; or perhaps I was affected by the whole day, the\r\nexpedition and feverishness. As I said good-night to her I hugged her\r\nwarmly, as though she were my dearest and nearest friend, and in my\r\nexhausted state all the emotions of the day came back to me in a rush; I\r\nalmost shed tears as I nestled to her bosom. She noticed my overwrought\r\ncondition, and I believe my madcap herself was a little touched.\r\n\r\n\"You are a very good boy,\" she said, looking at me with gentle eyes,\r\n\"please don't be angry with me. You won't, will you?\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, we became the warmest and truest of friends.\r\n\r\nIt was rather early when I woke up, but the sun was already flooding the\r\nwhole room with brilliant light. I jumped out of bed feeling perfectly\r\nwell and strong, as though I had had no fever the day before; indeed, I\r\nfelt now unutterably joyful. I recalled the previous day and felt that I\r\nwould have given any happiness if I could at that minute have embraced\r\nmy new friend, the fair-haired beauty, again, as I had the night before;\r\nbut it was very early and every one was still asleep. Hurriedly dressing\r\nI went out into the garden and from there into the copse. I made my way\r\nwhere the leaves were thickest, where the fragrance of the trees was\r\nmore resinous, and where the sun peeped in most gaily, rejoicing that it\r\ncould penetrate the dense darkness of the foliage. It was a lovely\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nGoing on further and further, before I was aware of it I had reached the\r\nfurther end of the copse and came out on the river Moskva. It flowed at\r\nthe bottom of the hill two hundred paces below. On the opposite bank of\r\nthe river they were mowing. I watched whole rows of sharp scythes gleam\r\nall together in the sunlight at every swing of the mower and then vanish\r\nagain like little fiery snakes going into hiding; I watched the cut\r\ngrass flying on one side in dense rich swathes and being laid in long\r\nstraight lines. I don't know how long I spent in contemplation. At last\r\nI was roused from my reverie by hearing a horse snorting and impatiently\r\npawing the ground twenty paces from me, in the track which ran from the\r\nhigh road to the manor house. I don't know whether I heard this horse as\r\nsoon as the rider rode up and stopped there, or whether the sound had\r\nlong been in my ears without rousing me from my dreaming. Moved by\r\ncuriosity I went into the copse, and before I had gone many steps I\r\ncaught the sound of voices speaking rapidly, though in subdued tones. I\r\nwent up closer, carefully parting the branches of the bushes that edged\r\nthe path, and at once sprang back in amazement. I caught a glimpse of a\r\nfamiliar white dress and a soft feminine voice resounded like music in\r\nmy heart. It was Mme. M. She was standing beside a man on horseback who,\r\nstooping down from the saddle, was hurriedly talking to her, and to my\r\namazement I recognized him as N., the young man who had gone away the\r\nmorning before and over whose departure M. M. had been so busy. But\r\npeople had said at the time that he was going far away to somewhere in\r\nthe South of Russia, and so I was very much surprised at seeing him with\r\nus again so early, and alone with Mme. M.\r\n\r\nShe was moved and agitated as I had never seen her before, and tears\r\nwere glistening on her cheeks. The young man was holding her hand and\r\nstooping down to kiss it. I had come upon them at the moment of parting.\r\nThey seemed to be in haste. At last he took out of his pocket a sealed\r\nenvelope, gave it to Mme. M., put one arm round her, still not\r\ndismounting, and gave her a long, fervent kiss. A minute later he lashed\r\nhis horse and flew past me like an arrow. Mme. M. looked after him for\r\nsome moments, then pensively and disconsolately turned homewards. But\r\nafter going a few steps along the track she seemed suddenly to recollect\r\nherself, hurriedly parted the bushes and walked on through the copse.\r\n\r\nI followed her, surprised and perplexed by all that I had seen. My heart\r\nwas beating violently, as though from terror. I was, as it were,\r\nbenumbed and befogged; my ideas were shattered and turned upside down;\r\nbut I remember I was, for some reason, very sad. I got glimpses from\r\ntime to time through the green foliage of her white dress before me: I\r\nfollowed her mechanically, never losing sight of her, though I trembled\r\nat the thought that she might notice me. At last she came out on the\r\nlittle path that led to the house. After waiting half a minute I, too,\r\nemerged from the bushes; but what was my amazement when I saw lying on\r\nthe red sand of the path a sealed packet, which I recognized, from the\r\nfirst glance, as the one that had been given to Mme. M. ten minutes\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nI picked it up. On both sides the paper was blank, there was no address\r\non it. The envelope was not large, but it was fat and heavy, as though\r\nthere were three or more sheets of notepaper in it.\r\n\r\nWhat was the meaning of this envelope? No doubt it would explain the\r\nwhole mystery. Perhaps in it there was said all that N. had scarcely\r\nhoped to express in their brief, hurried interview. He had not even\r\ndismounted.... Whether he had been in haste or whether he had been\r\nafraid of being false to himself at the hour of parting--God only\r\nknows....\r\n\r\nI stopped, without coming out on the path, threw the envelope in the\r\nmost conspicuous place on it, and kept my eyes upon it, supposing that\r\nMme. M. would notice the loss and come back and look for it. But after\r\nwaiting four minutes I could stand it no longer, I picked up my find\r\nagain, put it in my pocket, and set off to overtake Mme. M. I came upon\r\nher in the big avenue in the garden. She was walking straight towards\r\nthe house with a swift and hurried step, though she was lost in thought,\r\nand her eyes were on the ground. I did not know what to do. Go up to\r\nher, give it her? That would be as good as saying that I knew\r\neverything, that I had seen it all. I should betray myself at the first\r\nword. And how should I look, at her? How would she look at me. I kept\r\nexpecting that she would discover her loss and return on her tracks.\r\nThen I could, unnoticed, have flung the envelope on the path and she\r\nwould have found it. But no! We were approaching the house; she had\r\nalready been noticed....\r\n\r\nAs ill-luck would have it every one had got up very early that day,\r\nbecause, after the unsuccessful expedition of the evening before, they\r\nhad arranged something new, of which I had heard nothing. All were\r\npreparing to set off, and were having breakfast in the verandah. I\r\nwaited for ten minutes, that I might not be seen with Mme. M., and\r\nmaking a circuit of the garden approached the house from the other side\r\na long time after her. She was walking up and down the verandah with her\r\narms folded, looking pale and agitated, and was obviously trying her\r\nutmost to suppress the agonizing, despairing misery which could be\r\nplainly discerned in her eyes, her walk, her every movement. Sometimes\r\nshe went down the verandah steps and walked a few paces among the\r\nflower-beds in the direction of the garden; her eyes were impatiently,\r\ngreedily, even incautiously, seeking something on the sand of the path\r\nand on the floor of the verandah. There could be no doubt she had\r\ndiscovered her loss and imagined she had dropped the letter somewhere\r\nhere, near the house--yes, that must be so, she was convinced of it.\r\n\r\nSome one noticed that she was pale and agitated, and others made the\r\nsame remark. She was besieged with questions about her health and\r\ncondolences. She had to laugh, to jest, to appear lively. From time to\r\ntime she looked at her husband, who was standing at the end of the\r\nterrace talking to two ladies, and the poor woman was overcome by the\r\nsame shudder, the same embarrassment, as on the day of his first\r\narrival. Thrusting my hand into my pocket and holding the letter tight\r\nin it, I stood at a little distance from them all, praying to fate that\r\nMme. M. should notice me. I longed to cheer her up, to relieve her\r\nanxiety if only by a glance; to say a word to her on the sly. But when\r\nshe did chance to look at me I dropped my eyes.\r\n\r\nI saw her distress and I was not mistaken. To this day I don't know her\r\nsecret. I know nothing but what I saw and what I have just described.\r\nThe intrigue was not such, perhaps, as one might suppose at the first\r\nglance. Perhaps that kiss was the kiss of farewell, perhaps it was the\r\nlast slight reward for the sacrifice made to her peace and honour. N.\r\nwas going away, he was leaving her, perhaps for ever. Even that letter I\r\nwas holding in my hand--who can tell what it contained! How can one\r\njudge? and who can condemn? And yet there is no doubt that the sudden\r\ndiscovery of her secret would have been terrible--would have been a\r\nfatal blow for her. I still remember her face at that minute, it could\r\nnot have shown more suffering. To feel, to know, to be convinced, to\r\nexpect, as though it were one's execution, that in a quarter of an hour,\r\nin a minute perhaps, all might be discovered, the letter might be found\r\nby some one, picked up; there was no address on it, it might be opened,\r\nand then.... What then? What torture could be worse than what was\r\nawaiting her? She moved about among those who would be her judges. In\r\nanother minute their smiling flattering faces would be menacing and\r\nmerciless. She would read mockery, malice and icy contempt on those\r\nfaces, and then her life would be plunged in everlasting darkness, with\r\nno dawn to follow.... Yes, I did not understand it then as I understand\r\nit now. I could only have vague suspicions and misgivings, and a\r\nheart-ache at the thought of her danger, which I could not fully\r\nunderstand. But whatever lay hidden in her secret, much was expiated, if\r\nexpiation were needed, by those moments of anguish of which I was\r\nwitness and which I shall never forget.\r\n\r\nBut then came a cheerful summons to set off; immediately every one was\r\nbustling about gaily; laughter and lively chatter were heard on all\r\nsides. Within two minutes the verandah was deserted. Mme. M. declined to\r\njoin the party, acknowledging at last that she was not well. But, thank\r\nGod, all the others set off, every one was in haste, and there was no\r\ntime to worry her with commiseration, inquiries, and advice. A few\r\nremained at home. Her husband said a few words to her; she answered that\r\nshe would be all right directly, that he need not be uneasy, that there\r\nwas no occasion for her to lie down, that she would go into the garden,\r\nalone ... with me ... here she glanced at me. Nothing could be more\r\nfortunate! I flushed with pleasure, with delight; a minute later we were\r\non the way.\r\n\r\nShe walked along the same avenues and paths by which she had returned\r\nfrom the copse, instinctively remembering the way she had come, gazing\r\nbefore her with her eyes fixed on the ground, looking about intently\r\nwithout answering me, possibly forgetting that I was walking beside her.\r\n\r\nBut when we had already reached the place where I had picked up the\r\nletter, and the path ended, Mme. M. suddenly stopped, and in a voice\r\nfaint and weak with misery said that she felt worse, and that she would\r\ngo home. But when she reached the garden fence she stopped again and\r\nthought a minute; a smile of despair came on her lips, and utterly worn\r\nout and exhausted, resigned, and making up her mind to the worst, she\r\nturned without a word and retraced her steps, even forgetting to tell me\r\nof her intention.\r\n\r\nMy heart was torn with sympathy, and I did not know what to do.\r\n\r\nWe went, or rather I led her, to the place from which an hour before I\r\nhad heard the tramp of a horse and their conversation. Here, close to a\r\nshady elm tree, was a seat hewn out of one huge stone, about which grew\r\nivy, wild jasmine, and dog-rose; the whole wood was dotted with little\r\nbridges, arbours, grottoes, and similar surprises. Mme. M. sat down on\r\nthe bench and glanced unconsciously at the marvellous view that lay open\r\nbefore us. A minute later she opened her book, and fixed her eyes upon\r\nit without reading, without turning the pages, almost unconscious of\r\nwhat she was doing. It was about half-past nine. The sun was already\r\nhigh and was floating gloriously in the deep, dark blue sky, as though\r\nmelting away in its own light. The mowers were by now far away; they\r\nwere scarcely visible from our side of the river; endless ridges of mown\r\ngrass crept after them in unbroken succession, and from time to time the\r\nfaintly stirring breeze wafted their fragrance to us. The never ceasing\r\nconcert of those who \"sow not, neither do they reap\" and are free as the\r\nair they cleave with their sportive wings was all about us. It seemed as\r\nthough at that moment every flower, every blade of grass was exhaling\r\nthe aroma of sacrifice, was saying to its Creator, \"Father, I am blessed\r\nand happy.\"\r\n\r\nI glanced at the poor woman, who alone was like one dead amidst all this\r\njoyous life; two big tears hung motionless on her lashes, wrung from her\r\nheart by bitter grief. It was in my power to relieve and console this\r\npoor, fainting heart, only I did not know how to approach the subject,\r\nhow to take the first step. I was in agonies. A hundred times I was on\r\nthe point of going up to her, but every time my face glowed like fire.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a bright idea dawned upon me. I had found a way of doing it; I\r\nrevived.\r\n\r\n\"Would you like me to pick you a nosegay?\" I said, in such a joyful\r\nvoice that Mme M. immediately raised her head and looked at me intently.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, do,\" she said at last in a weak voice, with a faint smile, at once\r\ndropping her eyes on the book again.\r\n\r\n\"Or soon they will be mowing the grass here and there will be no\r\nflowers,\" I cried, eagerly setting to work.\r\n\r\nI had soon picked my nosegay, a poor, simple one, I should have been\r\nashamed to take it indoors; but how light my heart was as I picked the\r\nflowers and tied them up! The dog-rose and the wild jasmine I picked\r\ncloser to the seat, I knew that not far off there was a field of rye,\r\nnot yet ripe. I ran there for cornflowers; I mixed them with tall ears\r\nof rye, picking out the finest and most golden. Close by I came upon a\r\nperfect nest of forget-me-nots, and my nosegay was almost complete.\r\nFarther away in the meadow there were dark-blue campanulas and wild\r\npinks, and I ran down to the very edge of the river to get yellow\r\nwater-lilies. At last, making my way back, and going for an instant into\r\nthe wood to get some bright green fan-shaped leaves of the maple to put\r\nround the nosegay, I happened to come across a whole family of pansies,\r\nclose to which, luckily for me, the fragrant scent of violets betrayed\r\nthe little flower hiding in the thick lush grass and still glistening\r\nwith drops of dew. The nosegay was complete. I bound it round with fine\r\nlong grass which twisted into a rope, and I carefully lay the letter in\r\nthe centre, hiding it with the flowers, but in such a way that it could\r\nbe very easily noticed if the slightest attention were bestowed upon my\r\nnosegay.\r\n\r\nI carried it to Mme. M.\r\n\r\nOn the way it seemed to me that the letter was lying too much in view: I\r\nhid it a little more. As I got nearer I thrust it still further in the\r\nflowers; and finally, when I was on the spot, I suddenly poked it so\r\ndeeply into the centre of the nosegay that it could not be noticed at\r\nall from outside. My cheeks were positively flaming. I wanted to hide my\r\nface in my hands and run away at once, but she glanced at my flowers as\r\nthough she had completely forgotten that I had gathered them.\r\nMechanically, almost without looking, she held out her hand and took my\r\npresent; but at once laid it on the seat as though I had handed it to\r\nher for that purpose and dropped her eyes to her book again, seeming\r\nlost in thought. I was ready to cry at this mischance. \"If only my\r\nnosegay were close to her,\" I thought; \"if only she had not forgotten\r\nit!\" I lay down on the grass not far off, put my right arm under my\r\nhead, and closed my eyes as though I were overcome by drowsiness. But I\r\nwaited, keeping my eyes fixed on her.\r\n\r\nTen minutes passed, it seemed to me that she was getting paler and paler\r\n... fortunately a blessed chance came to my aid.\r\n\r\nThis was a big, golden bee, brought by a kindly breeze, luckily for me.\r\nIt first buzzed over my head, and then flew up to Mme. M. She waved it\r\noff once or twice, but the bee grew more and more persistent. At last\r\nMme. M. snatched up my nosegay and waved it before my face. At that\r\ninstant the letter dropped out from among the flowers and fell straight\r\nupon the open book. I started. For some time Mme. M., mute with\r\namazement, stared first at the letter and then at the flowers which she\r\nwas holding in her hands, and she seemed unable to believe her eyes. All\r\nat once she flushed, started, and glanced at me. But I caught her\r\nmovement and I shut my eyes tight, pretending to be asleep. Nothing\r\nwould have induced me to look her straight in the face at that moment.\r\nMy heart was throbbing and leaping like a bird in the grasp of some\r\nvillage boy. I don't remember how long I lay with my eyes shut, two or\r\nthree minutes. At last I ventured to open them. Mme. M. was greedily\r\nreading the letter, and from her glowing cheeks, her sparkling, tearful\r\neyes, her bright face, every feature of which was quivering with joyful\r\nemotion, I guessed that there was happiness in the letter and all her\r\nmisery was dispersed like smoke. An agonizing, sweet feeling gnawed at\r\nmy heart, it was hard for me to go on pretending....\r\n\r\nI shall never forget that minute!\r\n\r\nSuddenly, a long way off, we heard voices--\r\n\r\n\"Mme. M.! Natalie! Natalie!\"\r\n\r\nMme. M. did not answer, but she got up quickly from the seat, came up to\r\nme and bent over me. I felt that she was looking straight into my face.\r\nMy eyelashes quivered, but I controlled myself and did not open my eyes.\r\nI tried to breathe more evenly and quietly, but my heart smothered me\r\nwith its violent throbbing. Her burning breath scorched my cheeks; she\r\nbent close down to my face as though trying to make sure. At last a kiss\r\nand tears fell on my hand, the one which was lying on my breast.\r\n\r\n\"Natalie! Natalie! where are you,\" we heard again, this time quite\r\nclose.\r\n\r\n\"Coming,\" said Mme. M., in her mellow, silvery voice, which was so\r\nchoked and quivering with tears and so subdued that no one but I could\r\nhear that, \"Coming!\"\r\n\r\nBut at that instant my heart at last betrayed me and seemed to send all\r\nmy blood rushing to my face. At that instant a swift, burning kiss\r\nscalded my lips. I uttered a faint cry. I opened my eyes, but at once\r\nthe same gauze kerchief fell upon them, as though she meant to screen me\r\nfrom the sun. An instant later she was gone. I heard nothing but the\r\nsound of rapidly retreating steps. I was alone....\r\n\r\nI pulled off her kerchief and kissed it, beside myself with rapture; for\r\nsome moments I was almost frantic.... Hardly able to breathe, leaning on\r\nmy elbow on the grass, I stared unconsciously before me at the\r\nsurrounding slopes, streaked with cornfields, at the river that flowed\r\ntwisting and winding far away, as far as the eye could see, between\r\nfresh hills and villages that gleamed like dots all over the sunlit\r\ndistance--at the dark-blue, hardly visible forests, which seemed as\r\nthough smoking at the edge of the burning sky, and a sweet stillness\r\ninspired by the triumphant peacefulness of the picture gradually brought\r\ncalm to my troubled heart. I felt more at ease and breathed more freely,\r\nbut my whole soul was full of a dumb, sweet yearning, as though a veil\r\nhad been drawn from my eyes as though at a foretaste of something. My\r\nfrightened heart, faintly quivering with expectation, was groping\r\ntimidly and joyfully towards some conjecture ... and all at once my\r\nbosom heaved, began aching as though something had pierced it, and\r\ntears, sweet tears, gushed from my eyes. I hid my face in my hands, and\r\nquivering like a blade of grass, gave myself up to the first\r\nconsciousness and revelation of my heart, the first vague glimpse of my\r\nnature. My childhood was over from that moment.\r\n\r\n * * * * *\r\n\r\nWhen two hours later I returned home I did not find Mme. M. Through some\r\nsudden chance she had gone back to Moscow with her husband. I never saw\r\nher again.\r\n\nMR. PROHARTCHIN\r\n\r\nA STORY\r\n\nIn the darkest and humblest corner of Ustinya Fyodorovna's flat lived\r\nSemyon Ivanovitch Prohartchin, a well-meaning elderly man, who did not\r\ndrink. Since Mr. Prohartchin was of a very humble grade in the service,\r\nand received a salary strictly proportionate to his official capacity,\r\nUstinya Fyodorovna could not get more than five roubles a month from him\r\nfor his lodging. Some people said that she had her own reasons for\r\naccepting him as a lodger; but, be that as it may, as though in despite\r\nof all his detractors, Mr. Prohartchin actually became her favourite, in\r\nan honourable and virtuous sense, of course. It must be observed that\r\nUstinya Fyodorovna, a very respectable woman, who had a special\r\npartiality for meat and coffee, and found it difficult to keep the\r\nfasts, let rooms to several other boarders who paid twice as much as\r\nSemyon Ivanovitch, yet not being quiet lodgers, but on the contrary all\r\nof them \"spiteful scoffers\" at her feminine ways and her forlorn\r\nhelplessness, stood very low in her good opinion, so that if it had not\r\nbeen for the rent they paid, she would not have cared to let them stay,\r\nnor indeed to see them in her flat at all. Semyon Ivanovitch had become\r\nher favourite from the day when a retired, or, perhaps more correctly\r\nspeaking, discharged clerk, with a weakness for strong drink, was\r\ncarried to his last resting-place in Volkovo. Though this gentleman had\r\nonly one eye, having had the other knocked out owing, in his own words,\r\nto his valiant behaviour; and only one leg, the other having been broken\r\nin the same way owing to his valour; yet he had succeeded in winning all\r\nthe kindly feeling of which Ustinya Fyodorovna was capable, and took the\r\nfullest advantage of it, and would probably have gone on for years\r\nliving as her devoted satellite and toady if he had not finally drunk\r\nhimself to death in the most pitiable way. All this had happened at\r\nPeski, where Ustinya Fyodorovna only had three lodgers, of whom, when\r\nshe moved into a new flat and set up on a larger scale, letting to about\r\na dozen new boarders, Mr. Prohartchin was the only one who remained.\r\n\r\nWhether Mr. Prohartchin had certain incorrigible defects, or whether his\r\ncompanions were, every one of them, to blame, there seemed to be\r\nmisunderstandings on both sides from the first. We must observe here\r\nthat all Ustinya Fyodorovna's new lodgers without exception got on\r\ntogether like brothers; some of them were in the same office; each one\r\nof them by turns lost all his money to the others at faro, preference\r\nand _bixe_; they all liked in a merry hour to enjoy what they called the\r\nfizzing moments of life in a crowd together; they were fond, too, at\r\ntimes of discussing lofty subjects, and though in the end things rarely\r\npassed off without a dispute, yet as all prejudices were banished from\r\nthe whole party the general harmony was not in the least disturbed\r\nthereby. The most remarkable among the lodgers were Mark Ivanovitch, an\r\nintelligent and well-read man; then Oplevaniev; then Prepolovenko, also\r\na nice and modest person; then there was a certain Zinovy Prokofyevitch,\r\nwhose object in life was to get into aristocratic society; then there\r\nwas Okeanov, the copying clerk, who had in his time almost wrested the\r\ndistinction of prime favourite from Semyon Ivanovitch; then another\r\ncopying clerk called Sudbin; the plebeian Kantarev; there were others\r\ntoo. But to all these people Semyon Ivanovitch was, as it were, not one\r\nof themselves. No one wished him harm, of course, for all had from the\r\nvery first done Prohartchin justice, and had decided in Mark\r\nIvanovitch's words that he, Prohartchin, was a good and harmless fellow,\r\nthough by no means a man of the world, trustworthy, and not a flatterer,\r\nwho had, of course, his failings; but that if he were sometimes unhappy\r\nit was due to nothing else but lack of imagination. What is more, Mr.\r\nProhartchin, though deprived in this way of imagination, could never\r\nhave made a particularly favourable impression from his figure or\r\nmanners (upon which scoffers are fond of fastening), yet his figure did\r\nnot put people against him. Mark Ivanovitch, who was an intelligent\r\nperson, formally undertook Semyon Ivanovitch's defence, and declared in\r\nrather happy and flowery language that Prohartchin was an elderly and\r\nrespectable man, who had long, long ago passed the age of romance. And\r\nso, if Semyon Ivanovitch did not know how to get on with people, it must\r\nhave been entirely his own fault.\r\n\r\nThe first thing they noticed was the unmistakable parsimony and\r\nniggardliness of Semyon Ivanovitch. That was at once observed and noted,\r\nfor Semyon Ivanovitch would never lend any one his teapot, even for a\r\nmoment; and that was the more unjust as he himself hardly ever drank\r\ntea, but when he wanted anything drank, as a rule, rather a pleasant\r\ndecoction of wild flowers and certain medicinal herbs, of which he\r\nalways had a considerable store. His meals, too, were quite different\r\nfrom the other lodgers'. He never, for instance, permitted himself to\r\npartake of the whole dinner, provided daily by Ustinya Fyodorovna for\r\nthe other boarders. The dinner cost half a rouble; Semyon Ivanovitch\r\npaid only twenty-five kopecks in copper, and never exceeded it, and so\r\ntook either a plate of soup with pie, or a plate of beef; most\r\nfrequently he ate neither soup nor beef, but he partook in moderation of\r\nwhite bread with onion, curd, salted cucumber, or something similar,\r\nwhich was a great deal cheaper, and he would only go back to his half\r\nrouble dinner when he could stand it no longer....\r\n\r\nHere the biographer confesses that nothing would have induced him to\r\nallude to such realistic and low details, positively shocking and\r\noffensive to some lovers of the heroic style, if it were not that these\r\ndetails exhibit one peculiarity, one characteristic, in the hero of this\r\nstory; for Mr. Prohartchin was by no means so poor as to be unable to\r\nhave regular and sufficient meals, though he sometimes made out that he\r\nwas. But he acted as he did regardless of obloquy and people's\r\nprejudices, simply to satisfy his strange whims, and from frugality and\r\nexcessive carefulness: all this, however, will be much clearer later on.\r\nBut we will beware of boring the reader with the description of all\r\nSemyon Ivanovitch's whims, and will omit, for instance, the curious and\r\nvery amusing description of his attire; and, in fact, if it were not for\r\nUstinya Fyodorovna's own reference to it we should hardly have alluded\r\neven to the fact that Semyon Ivanovitch never could make up his mind to\r\nsend his linen to the wash, or if he ever did so it was so rarely that\r\nin the intervals one might have completely forgotten the existence of\r\nlinen on Semyon Ivanovitch. From the landlady's evidence it appeared\r\nthat \"Semyon Ivanovitch, bless his soul, poor lamb, for twenty years had\r\nbeen tucked away in his corner, without caring what folks thought, for\r\nall the days of his life on earth he was a stranger to socks,\r\nhandkerchiefs, and all such things,\" and what is more, Ustinya\r\nFyodorovna had seen with her own eyes, thanks to the decrepitude of the\r\nscreen, that the poor dear man sometimes had had nothing to cover his\r\nbare skin.\r\n\r\nSuch were the rumours in circulation after Semyon Ivanovitch's death.\r\nBut in his lifetime (and this was one of the most frequent occasions of\r\ndissension) he could not endure it if any one, even somebody on friendly\r\nterms with him, poked his inquisitive nose uninvited into his corner,\r\neven through an aperture in the decrepit screen. He was a taciturn man\r\ndifficult to deal with and prone to ill health. He did not like people\r\nto give him advice, he did not care for people who put themselves\r\nforward either, and if any one jeered at him or gave him advice unasked,\r\nhe would fall foul of him at once, put him to shame, and settle his\r\nbusiness. \"You are a puppy, you are a featherhead, you are not one to\r\ngive advice, so there--you mind your own business, sir. You'd better\r\ncount the stitches in your own socks, sir, so there!\"\r\n\r\nSemyon Ivanovitch was a plain man, and never used the formal mode of\r\naddress to any one. He could not bear it either when some one who knew\r\nhis little ways would begin from pure sport pestering him with\r\nquestions, such as what he had in his little trunk.... Semyon Ivanovitch\r\nhad one little trunk. It stood under his bed, and was guarded like the\r\napple of his eye; and though every one knew that there was nothing in it\r\nexcept old rags, two or three pairs of damaged boots and all sorts of\r\nrubbish, yet Mr. Prohartchin prized his property very highly, and they\r\nused even to hear him at one time express dissatisfaction with his old,\r\nbut still sound, lock, and talk of getting a new one of a special German\r\npattern with a secret spring and various complications. When on one\r\noccasion Zinovy Prokofyevitch, carried away by the thoughtlessness of\r\nyouth, gave expression to the very coarse and unseemly idea, that Semyon\r\nIvanovitch was probably hiding and treasuring something in his box to\r\nleave to his descendants, every one who happened to be by was stupefied\r\nat the extraordinary effects of Zinovy Prokofyevitch's sally. At first\r\nMr. Prohartchin could not find suitable terms for such a crude and\r\ncoarse idea. For a long time words dropped from his lips quite\r\nincoherently, and it was only after a while they made out that Semyon\r\nIvanovitch was reproaching Zinovy Prokofyevitch for some shabby action\r\nin the remote past; then they realized that Semyon Ivanovitch was\r\npredicting that Zinovy Prokofyevitch would never get into aristocratic\r\nsociety, and that the tailor to whom he owed a bill for his suits would\r\nbeat him--would certainly beat him--because the puppy had not paid him\r\nfor so long; and finally, \"You puppy, you,\" Semyon Ivanovitch added,\r\n\"here you want to get into the hussars, but you won't, I tell you,\r\nyou'll make a fool of yourself. And I tell you what, you puppy, when\r\nyour superiors know all about it they will take and make you a copying\r\nclerk; so that will be the end of it! Do you hear, puppy?\" Then Semyon\r\nIvanovitch subsided, but after lying down for five hours, to the intense\r\nastonishment of every one he seemed to have reached a decision, and\r\nbegan suddenly reproaching and abusing the young man again, at first to\r\nhimself and afterwards addressing Zinovy Prokofyevitch. But the matter\r\ndid not end there, and in the evening, when Mark Ivanovitch and\r\nPrepolovenko made tea and asked Okeanov to drink it with them, Semyon\r\nIvanovitch got up from his bed, purposely joined them, subscribing his\r\nfifteen or twenty kopecks, and on the pretext of a sudden desire for a\r\ncup of tea began at great length going into the subject, and explaining\r\nthat he was a poor man, nothing but a poor man, and that a poor man like\r\nhim had nothing to save. Mr. Prohartchin confessed that he was a poor\r\nman on this occasion, he said, simply because the subject had come up;\r\nthat the day before yesterday he had meant to borrow a rouble from that\r\nimpudent fellow, but now he should not borrow it for fear the puppy\r\nshould brag, that that was the fact of the matter, and that his salary\r\nwas such that one could not buy enough to eat, and that finally, a poor\r\nman, as you see, he sent his sister-in-law in Tver five roubles every\r\nmonth, that if he did not send his sister-in-law in Tver five roubles\r\nevery month his sister-in-law would die, and if his sister-in-law, who\r\nwas dependent on him, were dead, he, Semyon Ivanovitch, would long ago\r\nhave bought himself a new suit.... And Semyon Ivanovitch went on talking\r\nin this way at great length about being a poor man, about his\r\nsister-in-law and about roubles, and kept repeating the same thing over\r\nand over again to impress it on his audience till he got into a regular\r\nmuddle and relapsed into silence. Only three days later, when they had\r\nall forgotten about him, and no one was thinking of attacking him, he\r\nadded something in conclusion to the effect that when Zinovy\r\nProkofyevitch went into the hussars the impudent fellow would have his\r\nleg cut off in the war, and then he would come with a wooden leg and\r\nsay; \"Semyon Ivanovitch, kind friend, give me something to eat!\" and\r\nthen Semyon Ivanovitch would not give him something to eat, and would\r\nnot look at the insolent fellow; and that's how it would be, and he\r\ncould just make the best of it.\r\n\r\nAll this naturally seemed very curious and at the same time fearfully\r\namusing. Without much reflection, all the lodgers joined together for\r\nfurther investigation, and simply from curiosity determined to make a\r\nfinal onslaught on Semyon Ivanovitch _en masse_. And as Mr. Prohartchin,\r\ntoo, had of late--that is, ever since he had begun living in the same\r\nflat with them--been very fond of finding out everything about them and\r\nasking inquisitive questions, probably for private reasons of his own,\r\nrelations sprang up between the opposed parties without any preparation\r\nor effort on either side, as it were by chance and of itself. To get\r\ninto relations Semyon Ivanovitch always had in reserve his peculiar,\r\nrather sly, and very ingenuous manoeuvre, of which the reader has\r\nlearned something already. He would get off his bed about tea-time, and\r\nif he saw the others gathered together in a group to make tea he would\r\ngo up to them like a quiet, sensible, and friendly person, hand over his\r\ntwenty kopecks, as he was entitled to do, and announce that he wished to\r\njoin them. Then the young men would wink at one another, and so\r\nindicating that they were in league together against Semyon Ivanovitch,\r\nwould begin a conversation, at first strictly proper and decorous. Then\r\none of the wittier of the party would, _a propos_ of nothing, fall to\r\ntelling them news consisting most usually of entirely false and quite\r\nincredible details. He would say, for instance, that some one had heard\r\nHis Excellency that day telling Demid Vassilyevitch that in his opinion\r\nmarried clerks were more trustworthy than unmarried, and more suitable\r\nfor promotion; for they were steady, and that their capacities were\r\nconsiderably improved by marriage, and that therefore he--that is, the\r\nspeaker--in order to improve and be better fitted for promotion, was\r\ndoing his utmost to enter the bonds of matrimony as soon as possible\r\nwith a certain Fevronya Prokofyevna. Or he would say that it had more\r\nthan once been remarked about certain of his colleagues that they were\r\nentirely devoid of social graces and of well-bred, agreeable manners,\r\nand consequently unable to please ladies in good society, and that,\r\ntherefore, to eradicate this defect it would be suitable to deduct\r\nsomething from their salary, and with the sum so obtained, to hire a\r\nhall, where they could learn to dance, acquire the outward signs of\r\ngentlemanliness and good-breeding, courtesy, respect for their seniors,\r\nstrength of will, a good and grateful heart and various agreeable\r\nqualities. Or he would say that it was being arranged that some of the\r\nclerks, beginning with the most elderly, were to be put through an\r\nexamination in all sorts of subjects to raise their standard of culture,\r\nand in that way, the speaker would add, all sorts of things would come\r\nto light, and certain gentlemen would have to lay their cards on the\r\ntable--in short, thousands of similar very absurd rumours were\r\ndiscussed. To keep it up, every one believed the story at once, showed\r\ninterest in it, asked questions, applied it to themselves; and some of\r\nthem, assuming a despondent air, began shaking their heads and asking\r\nevery one's advice, saying what were they to do if they were to come\r\nunder it? It need hardly be said that a man far less credulous and\r\nsimple-hearted than Mr. Prohartchin would have been puzzled and carried\r\naway by a rumour so unanimously believed. Moreover, from all\r\nappearances, it might be safely concluded that Semyon Ivanovitch was\r\nexceedingly stupid and slow to grasp any new unusual idea, and that when\r\nhe heard anything new, he had always first, as it were, to chew it over\r\nand digest it, to find out the meaning, and struggling with it in\r\nbewilderment, at last perhaps to overcome it, though even then in a\r\nquite special manner peculiar to himself alone....\r\n\r\nIn this way curious and hitherto unexpected qualities began to show\r\nthemselves in Semyon Ivanovitch.... Talk and tittle-tattle followed, and\r\nby devious ways it all reached the office at last, with additions. What\r\nincreased the sensation was the fact that Mr. Prohartchin, who had\r\nlooked almost exactly the same from time immemorial, suddenly, _a\r\npropos_ of nothing, wore quite a different countenance. His face was\r\nuneasy, his eyes were timid and had a scared and rather suspicious\r\nexpression. He took to walking softly, starting and listening, and to\r\nput the finishing touch to his new characteristics developed a passion\r\nfor investigating the truth. He carried his love of truth at last to\r\nsuch a pitch as to venture, on two occasions, to inquire of Demid\r\nVassilyevitch himself concerning the credibility of the strange rumours\r\nthat reached him daily by dozens, and if we say nothing here of the\r\nconsequence of the action of Semyon Ivanovitch, it is for no other\r\nreason but a sensitive regard for his reputation. It was in this way\r\npeople came to consider him as misanthropic and regardless of the\r\nproprieties. Then they began to discover that there was a great deal\r\nthat was fantastical about him, and in this they were not altogether\r\nmistaken, for it was observed on more than one occasion that Semyon\r\nIvanovitch completely forgot himself, and sitting in his seat with his\r\nmouth open and his pen in the air, as though frozen or petrified, looked\r\nmore like the shadow of a rational being than that rational being\r\nitself. It sometimes happened that some innocently gaping gentleman, on\r\nsuddenly catching his straying, lustreless, questioning eyes, was scared\r\nand all of a tremor, and at once inserted into some important document\r\neither a smudge or some quite inappropriate word. The impropriety of\r\nSemyon Ivanovitch's behaviour embarrassed and annoyed all really\r\nwell-bred people.... At last no one could feel any doubt of the\r\neccentricity of Semyon Ivanovitch's mind, when one fine morning the\r\nrumour was all over the office that Mr. Prohartchin had actually\r\nfrightened Demid Vassilyevitch himself, for, meeting him in the\r\ncorridor, Semyon Ivanovitch had been so strange and peculiar that he had\r\nforced his superior to beat a retreat.... The news of Semyon\r\nIvanovitch's behaviour reached him himself at last. Hearing of it he got\r\nup at once, made his way carefully between the chairs and tables,\r\nreached the entry, took down his overcoat with his own hand, put it on,\r\nwent out, and disappeared for an indefinite period. Whether he was led\r\ninto this by alarm or some other impulse we cannot say, but no trace was\r\nseen of him for a time either at home or at the office....\r\n\r\nWe will not attribute Semyon Ivanovitch's fate simply to his\r\neccentricity, yet we must observe to the reader that our hero was a very\r\nretiring man, unaccustomed to society, and had, until he made the\r\nacquaintance of the new lodgers, lived in complete unbroken solitude,\r\nand had been marked by his quietness and even a certain mysteriousness;\r\nfor he had spent all the time that he lodged at Peski lying on his bed\r\nbehind the screen, without talking or having any sort of relations with\r\nany one. Both his old fellow-lodgers lived exactly as he did: they, too\r\nwere, somehow mysterious people and spent fifteen years lying behind\r\ntheir screens. The happy, drowsy hours and days trailed by, one after\r\nthe other, in patriarchal stagnation, and as everything around them went\r\nits way in the same happy fashion, neither Semyon Ivanovitch nor Ustinya\r\nFyodorovna could remember exactly when fate had brought them together.\r\n\r\n\"It may be ten years, it may be twenty, it may be even twenty-five\r\naltogether,\" she would say at times to her new lodgers, \"since he\r\nsettled with me, poor dear man, bless his heart!\" And so it was very\r\nnatural that the hero of our story, being so unaccustomed to society was\r\ndisagreeably surprised when, a year before, he, a respectable and modest\r\nman, had found himself, suddenly in the midst of a noisy and boisterous\r\ncrew, consisting of a dozen young fellows, his colleagues at the office,\r\nand his new house-mates.\r\n\r\nThe disappearance of Semyon Ivanovitch made no little stir in the\r\nlodgings. One thing was that he was the favourite; another, that his\r\npassport, which had been in the landlady's keeping, appeared to have\r\nbeen accidentally mislaid. Ustinya Fyodorovna raised a howl, as was her\r\ninvariable habit on all critical occasions. She spent two days in\r\nabusing and upbraiding the lodgers. She wailed that they had chased away\r\nher lodger like a chicken, and all those spiteful scoffers had been the\r\nruin of him; and on the third day she sent them all out to hunt for the\r\nfugitive and at all costs to bring him back, dead or alive. Towards\r\nevening Sudbin first came back with the news that traces had been\r\ndiscovered, that he had himself seen the runaway in Tolkutchy Market and\r\nother places, had followed and stood close to him, but had not dared to\r\nspeak to him; he had been near him in a crowd watching a house on fire\r\nin Crooked Lane. Half an hour later Okeanov and Kantarev came in and\r\nconfirmed Sudbin's story, word for word; they, too, had stood near, had\r\nfollowed him quite close, had stood not more than ten paces from him,\r\nbut they also had not ventured to speak to him, but both observed that\r\nSemyon Ivanovitch was walking with a drunken cadger. The other lodgers\r\nwere all back and together at last, and after listening attentively they\r\nmade up their minds that Prohartchin could not be far off and would not\r\nbe long in returning; but they said that they had all known beforehand\r\nthat he was about with a drunken cadger. This drunken cadger was a\r\nthoroughly bad lot, insolent and cringing, and it seemed evident that he\r\nhad got round Semyon Ivanovitch in some way. He had turned up just a\r\nweek before Semyon Ivanovitch's disappearance in company with Remnev,\r\nhad spent a little time in the flat telling them that he had suffered in\r\nthe cause of justice, that he had formerly been in the service in the\r\nprovinces, that an inspector had come down on them, that he and his\r\nassociates had somehow suffered in a good cause, that he had come to\r\nPetersburg and fallen at the feet of Porfiry Grigoryevitch, that he had\r\nbeen got, by interest, into a department; but through the cruel\r\npersecution of fate he had been discharged from there too, and that\r\nafterwards through reorganization the office itself had ceased to exist,\r\nand that he had not been included in the new revised staff of clerks\r\nowing as much to direct incapacity for official work as to capacity for\r\nsomething else quite irrelevant--all this mixed up with his passion for\r\njustice and of course the trickery of his enemies. After finishing his\r\nstory, in the course of which Mr. Zimoveykin more than once kissed his\r\nsullen and unshaven friend Remnev, he bowed down to all in the room in\r\nturn, not forgetting Avdotya the servant, called them all his\r\nbenefactors, and explained that he was an undeserving, troublesome,\r\nmean, insolent and stupid man, and that good people must not be hard on\r\nhis pitiful plight and simplicity. After begging for their kind\r\nprotection Mr. Zimoveykin showed his livelier side, grew very cheerful,\r\nkissed Ustinya Fyodorovna's hands, in spite of her modest protests that\r\nher hand was coarse and not like a lady's; and towards evening promised\r\nto show the company his talent in a remarkable character dance. But next\r\nday his visit ended in a lamentable _denouement_. Either because there\r\nhad been too much character in the character-dance, or because he had,\r\nin Ustinya Fyodorovna's own words, somehow \"insulted her and treated her\r\nas no lady, though she was on friendly terms with Yaroslav Ilyitch\r\nhimself, and if she liked might long ago have been an officer's wife,\"\r\nZimoveykin had to steer for home next day. He went away, came back\r\nagain, was again turned out with ignominy, then wormed his way into\r\nSemyon Ivanovitch's good graces, robbed him incidentally of his new\r\nbreeches, and now it appeared he had led Semyon Ivanovitch astray.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the landlady knew that Semyon Ivanovitch was alive and well,\r\nand that there was no need to hunt for his passport, she promptly left\r\noff grieving and was pacified. Meanwhile some of the lodgers determined\r\nto give the runaway a triumphal reception; they broke the bolt and moved\r\naway the screen from Mr. Prohartchin's bed, rumpled up the bed a little,\r\ntook the famous box, put it at the foot of the bed; and on the bed laid\r\nthe sister-in-law, that is, a dummy made up of an old kerchief, a cap\r\nand a mantle of the landlady's, such an exact counterfeit of a\r\nsister-in-law that it might have been mistaken for one. Having finished\r\ntheir work they waited for Semyon Ivanovitch to return, meaning to tell\r\nhim that his sister-in-law had arrived from the country and was there\r\nbehind his screen, poor thing! But they waited and waited.\r\n\r\nAlready, while they waited, Mark Ivanovitch had staked and lost half a\r\nmonth's salary to Prepolovenko and Kantarev; already Okeanov's nose had\r\ngrown red and swollen playing \"flips on the nose\" and \"three cards;\"\r\nalready Avdotya the servant had almost had her sleep out and had twice\r\nbeen on the point of getting up to fetch the wood and light the stove,\r\nand Zinovy Prokofyevitch, who kept running out every minute to see\r\nwhether Semyon Ivanovitch were coming, was wet to the skin; but there\r\nwas no sign of any one yet--neither Semyon Ivanovitch nor the drunken\r\ncadger. At last every one went to bed, leaving the sister-in-law behind\r\nthe screen in readiness for any emergency; and it was not till four\r\no'clock that a knock was heard at the gate, but when it did come it was\r\nso loud that it quite made up to the expectant lodgers for all the\r\nwearisome trouble they had been through. It was he--he himself--Semyon\r\nIvanovitch, Mr. Prohartchin, but in such a condition that they all cried\r\nout in dismay, and no one thought about the sister-in-law. The lost man\r\nwas unconscious. He was brought in, or more correctly carried in, by a\r\nsopping and tattered night-cabman. To the landlady's question where the\r\npoor dear man had got so groggy, the cabman answered: \"Why, he is not\r\ndrunk and has not had a drop, that I can tell you, for sure; but\r\nseemingly a faintness has come over him, or some sort of a fit, or maybe\r\nhe's been knocked down by a blow.\"\r\n\r\nThey began examining him, propping the culprit against the stove to do\r\nso more conveniently, and saw that it really was not a case of\r\ndrunkenness, nor had he had a blow, but that something else was wrong,\r\nfor Semyon Ivanovitch could not utter a word, but seemed twitching in a\r\nsort of convulsion, and only blinked, fixing his eyes in bewilderment\r\nfirst on one and then on another of the spectators, who were all attired\r\nin night array. Then they began questioning the cabman, asking where he\r\nhad got him from. \"Why, from folks out Kolomna way,\" he answered. \"Deuce\r\nknows what they are, not exactly gentry, but merry, rollicking\r\ngentlemen; so he was like this when they gave him to me; whether they\r\nhad been fighting, or whether he was in some sort of a fit, goodness\r\nknows what it was; but they were nice, jolly gentlemen!\"\r\n\r\nSemyon Ivanovitch was taken, lifted high on the shoulders of two or\r\nthree sturdy fellows, and carried to his bed. When Semyon Ivanovitch on\r\nbeing put in bed felt the sister-in-law, and put his feet on his sacred\r\nbox, he cried out at the top of his voice, squatted up almost on his\r\nheels, and trembling and shaking all over, with his hands and his body\r\nhe cleared a space as far as he could in his bed, while gazing with a\r\ntremulous but strangely resolute look at those present, he seemed as it\r\nwere to protest that he would sooner die than give up the hundredth part\r\nof his poor belongings to any one....\r\n\r\nSemyon Ivanovitch lay for two or three days closely barricaded by the\r\nscreen, and so cut off from all the world and all its vain anxieties.\r\nNext morning, of course, every one had forgotten about him; time,\r\nmeanwhile, flew by as usual, hour followed hour and day followed day.\r\nThe sick man's heavy, feverish brain was plunged in something between\r\nsleep and delirium; but he lay quietly and did not moan or complain; on\r\nthe contrary he kept still and silent and controlled himself, lying low\r\nin his bed, just as the hare lies close to the earth when it hears the\r\nhunter. At times a long depressing stillness prevailed in the flat, a\r\nsign that the lodgers had all gone to the office, and Semyon Ivanovitch,\r\nwaking up, could relieve his depression by listening to the bustle in\r\nthe kitchen, where the landlady was busy close by; or to the regular\r\nflop of Avdotya's down-trodden slippers as, sighing and moaning, she\r\ncleared away, rubbed and polished, tidying all the rooms in the flat.\r\nWhole hours passed by in that way, drowsy, languid, sleepy, wearisome,\r\nlike the water that dripped with a regular sound from the locker into\r\nthe basin in the kitchen. At last the lodgers would arrive, one by one\r\nor in groups, and Semyon Ivanovitch could very conveniently hear them\r\nabusing the weather, saying they were hungry, making a noise, smoking,\r\nquarrelling, and making friends, playing cards, and clattering the cups\r\nas they got ready for tea. Semyon Ivanovitch mechanically made an effort\r\nto get up and join them, as he had a right to do at tea; but he at once\r\nsank back into drowsiness, and dreamed that he had been sitting a long\r\ntime at the tea-table, having tea with them and talking, and that Zinovy\r\nProkofyevitch had already seized the opportunity to introduce into the\r\nconversation some scheme concerning sisters-in-law and the moral\r\nrelation of various worthy people to them. At this point Semyon\r\nIvanovitch was in haste to defend himself and reply. But the mighty\r\nformula that flew from every tongue--\"It has more than once been\r\nobserved\"--cut short all his objections, and Semyon Ivanovitch could do\r\nnothing better than begin dreaming again that to-day was the first of\r\nthe month and that he was receiving money in his office.\r\n\r\nUndoing the paper round it on the stairs, he looked about him quickly,\r\nand made haste as fast as he could to subtract half of the lawful wages\r\nhe had received and conceal it in his boot. Then on the spot, on the\r\nstairs, quite regardless of the fact that he was in bed and asleep, he\r\nmade up his mind when he reached home to give his landlady what was due\r\nfor board and lodging; then to buy certain necessities, and to show any\r\none it might concern, as it were casually and unintentionally, that some\r\nof his salary had been deducted, that now he had nothing left to send\r\nhis sister-in-law; then to speak with commiseration of his\r\nsister-in-law, to say a great deal about her the next day and the day\r\nafter, and ten days later to say something casually again about her\r\npoverty, that his companions might not forget. Making this determination\r\nhe observed that Andrey Efimovitch, that everlastingly silent, bald\r\nlittle man who sat in the office three rooms from where Semyon\r\nIvanovitch sat, and hadn't said a word to him for twenty years, was\r\nstanding on the stairs, that he, too, was counting his silver roubles,\r\nand shaking his head, he said to him: \"Money!\" \"If there's no money\r\nthere will be no porridge,\" he added grimly as he went down the stairs,\r\nand just at the door he ended: \"And I have seven children, sir.\" Then\r\nthe little bald man, probably equally unconscious that he was acting as\r\na phantom and not as a substantial reality, held up his hand about\r\nthirty inches from the floor, and waving it vertically, muttered that\r\nthe eldest was going to school, then glancing with indignation at Semyon\r\nIvanovitch, as though it were Mr. Prohartchin's fault that he was the\r\nfather of seven, pulled his old hat down over his eyes, and with a whisk\r\nof his overcoat he turned to the left and disappeared. Semyon Ivanovitch\r\nwas quite frightened, and though he was fully convinced of his own\r\ninnocence in regard to the unpleasant accumulation of seven under one\r\nroof, yet it seemed to appear that in fact no one else was to blame but\r\nSemyon Ivanovitch. Panic-stricken he set off running, for it seemed to\r\nhim that the bald gentleman had turned back, was running after him, and\r\nmeant to search him and take away all his salary, insisting upon the\r\nindisputable number seven, and resolutely denying any possible claim of\r\nany sort of sisters-in-law upon Semyon Ivanovitch. Prohartchin ran and\r\nran, gasping for breath.... Beside him was running, too, an immense\r\nnumber of people, and all of them were jingling their money in the\r\ntailpockets of their skimpy little dress-coats; at last every one ran\r\nup, there was the noise of fire engines, and whole masses of people\r\ncarried him almost on their shoulders up to that same house on fire\r\nwhich he had watched last time in company with the drunken cadger. The\r\ndrunken cadger--alias Mr. Zimoveykin--was there now, too, he met Semyon\r\nIvanovitch, made a fearful fuss, took him by the arm, and led him into\r\nthe thickest part of the crowd. Just as then in reality, all about them\r\nwas the noise and uproar of an immense crowd of people, flooding the\r\nwhole of Fontanka Embankment between the two bridges, as well as all the\r\nsurrounding streets and alleys; just as then, Semyon Ivanovitch, in\r\ncompany with the drunken cadger, was carried along behind a fence, where\r\nthey were squeezed as though in pincers in a huge timber-yard full of\r\nspectators who had gathered from the street, from Tolkutchy Market and\r\nfrom all the surrounding houses, taverns, and restaurants. Semyon\r\nIvanovitch saw all this and felt as he had done at the time; in the\r\nwhirl of fever and delirium all sorts of strange figures began flitting\r\nbefore him. He remembered some of them. One of them was a gentleman who\r\nhad impressed every one extremely, a man seven feet high, with whiskers\r\nhalf a yard long, who had been standing behind Semyon Ivanovitch's back\r\nduring the fire, and had given him encouragement from behind, when our\r\nhero had felt something like ecstasy and had stamped as though intending\r\nthereby to applaud the gallant work of the firemen, from which he had an\r\nexcellent view from his elevated position. Another was the sturdy lad\r\nfrom whom our hero had received a shove by way of a lift on to another\r\nfence, when he had been disposed to climb over it, possibly to save some\r\none. He had a glimpse, too, of the figure of the old man with a sickly\r\nface, in an old wadded dressing-gown, tied round the waist, who had made\r\nhis appearance before the fire in a little shop buying sugar and tobacco\r\nfor his lodger, and who now, with a milk-can and a quart pot in his\r\nhands, made his way through the crowd to the house in which his wife and\r\ndaughter were burning together with thirteen and a half roubles in the\r\ncorner under the bed. But most distinct of all was the poor, sinful\r\nwoman of whom he had dreamed more than once during his illness--she\r\nstood before him now as she had done then, in wretched bark shoes and\r\nrags, with a crutch and a wicker-basket on her back. She was shouting\r\nmore loudly than the firemen or the crowd, waving her crutch and her\r\narms, saying that her own children had turned her out and that she had\r\nlost two coppers in consequence. The children and the coppers, the\r\ncoppers and the children, were mingled together in an utterly\r\nincomprehensible muddle, from which every one withdrew baffled, after\r\nvain efforts to understand. But the woman would not desist, she kept\r\nwailing, shouting, and waving her arms, seeming to pay no attention\r\neither to the fire up to which she had been carried by the crowd from\r\nthe street or to the people about her, or to the misfortune of\r\nstrangers, or even to the sparks and red-hot embers which were beginning\r\nto fall in showers on the crowd standing near. At last Mr. Prohartchin\r\nfelt that a feeling of terror was coming upon him; for he saw clearly\r\nthat all this was not, so to say, an accident, and that he would not get\r\noff scot-free. And, indeed, upon the woodstack, close to him, was a\r\npeasant, in a torn smock that hung loose about him, with his hair and\r\nbeard singed, and he began stirring up all the people against Semyon\r\nIvanovitch. The crowd pressed closer and closer, the peasant shouted,\r\nand foaming at the mouth with horror, Mr. Prohartchin suddenly realized\r\nthat this peasant was a cabman whom he had cheated five years before in\r\nthe most inhuman way, slipping away from him without paying through a\r\nside gate and jerking up his heels as he ran as though he were barefoot\r\non hot bricks. In despair Mr. Prohartchin tried to speak, to scream, but\r\nhis voice failed him. He felt that the infuriated crowd was twining\r\nround him like a many-coloured snake, strangling him, crushing him. He\r\nmade an incredible effort and awoke. Then he saw that he was on fire,\r\nthat all his corner was on fire, that his screen was on fire, that the\r\nwhole flat was on fire, together with Ustinya Fyodorovna and all her\r\nlodgers, that his bed was burning, his pillow, his quilt, his box, and\r\nlast of all, his precious mattress. Semyon Ivanovitch jumped up,\r\nclutched at the mattress and ran dragging it after him. But in the\r\nlandlady's room into which, regardless of decorum, our hero ran just as\r\nhe was, barefoot and in his shirt, he was seized, held tight, and\r\ntriumphantly carried back behind the screen, which meanwhile was not on\r\nfire--it seemed that it was rather Semyon Ivanovitch's head that was on\r\nfire--and was put back to bed. It was just as some tattered, unshaven,\r\nill-humoured organ-grinder puts away in his travelling box the Punch who\r\nhas been making an upset, drubbing all the other puppets, selling his\r\nsoul to the devil, and who at last ends his existence, till the next\r\nperformance, in the same box with the devil, the negroes, the Pierrot,\r\nand Mademoiselle Katerina with her fortunate lover, the captain.\r\n\r\nImmediately every one, old and young, surrounded Semyon Ivanovitch,\r\nstanding in a row round his bed and fastening eyes full of expectation\r\non the invalid. Meantime he had come to himself, but from shame or some\r\nother feeling, began pulling up the quilt over him, apparently wishing\r\nto hide himself under it from the attention of his sympathetic friends.\r\nAt last Mark Ivanovitch was the first to break silence, and as a\r\nsensible man he began saying in a very friendly way that Semyon\r\nIvanovitch must keep calm, that it was too bad and a shame to be ill,\r\nthat only little children behaved like that, that he must get well and\r\ngo to the office. Mark Ivanovitch ended by a little joke, saying that no\r\nregular salary had yet been fixed for invalids, and as he knew for a\r\nfact that their grade would be very low in the service, to his thinking\r\nanyway, their calling or condition did not promise great and substantial\r\nadvantages. In fact, it was evident that they were all taking genuine\r\ninterest in Semyon Ivanovitch's fate and were very sympathetic. But with\r\nincomprehensible rudeness, Semyon Ivanovitch persisted in lying in bed\r\nin silence, and obstinately pulling the quilt higher and higher over his\r\nhead. Mark Ivanovitch, however, would not be gainsaid, and restraining\r\nhis feelings, said something very honeyed to Semyon Ivanovitch again,\r\nknowing that that was how he ought to treat a sick man. But Semyon\r\nIvanovitch would not feel this: on the contrary he muttered something\r\nbetween his teeth with the most distrustful air, and suddenly began\r\nglancing askance from right to left in a hostile way, as though he would\r\nhave reduced his sympathetic friends to ashes with his eyes. It was no\r\nuse letting it stop there. Mark Ivanovitch lost patience, and seeing\r\nthat the man was offended and completely exasperated, and had simply\r\nmade up his mind to be obstinate, told him straight out, without any\r\nsoftening suavity, that it was time to get up, that it was no use lying\r\nthere, that shouting day and night about houses on fire, sisters-in-law,\r\ndrunken cadgers, locks, boxes and goodness knows what, was all stupid,\r\nimproper, and degrading, for if Semyon Ivanovitch did not want to sleep\r\nhimself he should not hinder other people, and please would he bear it\r\nin mind.\r\n\r\nThis speech produced its effects, for Semyon Ivanovitch, turning\r\npromptly to the orator, articulated firmly, though in a hoarse voice,\r\n\"You hold your tongue, puppy! You idle speaker, you foul-mouthed man! Do\r\nyou hear, young dandy? Are you a prince, eh? Do you understand what I\r\nsay?\"\r\n\r\nHearing such insults, Mark Ivanovitch fired up, but realizing that he\r\nhad to deal with a sick man, magnanimously overcame his resentment and\r\ntried to shame him out of his humour, but was cut short in that too; for\r\nSemyon Ivanovitch observed at once that he would not allow people to\r\nplay with him for all that Mark Ivanovitch wrote poetry. Then followed a\r\nsilence of two minutes; at last recovering from his amazement Mark\r\nIvanovitch, plainly, clearly, in well-chosen language, but with\r\nfirmness, declared that Semyon Ivanovitch ought to understand that he\r\nwas among gentlemen, and \"you ought to understand, sir, how to behave\r\nwith gentlemen.\"\r\n\r\nMark Ivanovitch could on occasion speak effectively and liked to impress\r\nhis hearers, but, probably from the habit of years of silence, Semyon\r\nIvanovitch talked and acted somewhat abruptly; and, moreover, when he\r\ndid on occasion begin a long sentence, as he got further into it every\r\nword seemed to lead to another word, that other word to a third word,\r\nthat third to a fourth and so on, so that his mouth seemed brimming\r\nover; he began stuttering, and the crowding words took to flying out in\r\npicturesque disorder. That was why Semyon Ivanovitch, who was a sensible\r\nman, sometimes talked terrible nonsense. \"You are lying,\" he said now.\r\n\"You booby, you loose fellow! You'll come to want--you'll go begging,\r\nyou seditious fellow, you--you loafer. Take that, you poet!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you are still raving, aren't you, Semyon Ivanovitch?\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you what,\" answered Semyon Ivanovitch, \"fools rave, drunkards\r\nrave, dogs rave, but a wise man acts sensibly. I tell you, you don't\r\nknow your own business, you loafer, you educated gentleman, you learned\r\nbook! Here, you'll get on fire and not notice your head's burning off.\r\nWhat do you think of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why ... you mean.... How do you mean, burn my head off, Semyon\r\nIvanovitch?\"\r\n\r\nMark Ivanovitch said no more, for every one saw clearly that Semyon\r\nIvanovitch was not yet in his sober senses, but delirious.\r\n\r\nBut the landlady could not resist remarking at this point that the house\r\nin Crooked Lane had been burnt owing to a bald wench; that there was a\r\nbald-headed wench living there, that she had lighted a candle and set\r\nfire to the lumber room; but nothing would happen in her place, and\r\neverything would be all right in the flats.\r\n\r\n\"But look here, Semyon Ivanovitch,\" cried Zinovy Prokofyevitch, losing\r\npatience and interrupting the landlady, \"you old fogey, you old crock,\r\nyou silly fellow--are they making jokes with you now about your\r\nsister-in-law or examinations in dancing? Is that it? Is that what you\r\nthink?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, I tell you what,\" answered our hero, sitting up in bed and making\r\na last effort in a paroxysm of fury with his sympathetic friends. \"Who's\r\nthe fool? You are the fool, a dog is a fool, you joking gentleman. But I\r\nam not going to make jokes to please you, sir; do you hear, puppy? I am\r\nnot your servant, sir.\"\r\n\r\nSemyon Ivanovitch would have said something more, but he fell back in\r\nbed helpless. His sympathetic friends were left gaping in perplexity,\r\nfor they understood now what was wrong with Semyon Ivanovitch and did\r\nnot know how to begin. Suddenly the kitchen door creaked and opened, and\r\nthe drunken cadger--alias Mr. Zimoveykin--timidly thrust in his head,\r\ncautiously sniffing round the place as his habit was. It seemed as\r\nthough he had been expected, every one waved to him at once to come\r\nquickly, and Zimoveykin, highly delighted, with the utmost readiness and\r\nhaste jostled his way to Semyon Ivanovitch's bedside.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that Zimoveykin had spent the whole night in vigil and in\r\ngreat exertions of some sort. The right side of his face was plastered\r\nup; his swollen eyelids were wet from his running eyes, his coat and all\r\nhis clothes were torn, while the whole left side of his attire was\r\nbespattered with something extremely nasty, possibly mud from a puddle.\r\nUnder his arm was somebody's violin, which he had been taking somewhere\r\nto sell. Apparently they had not made a mistake in summoning him to\r\ntheir assistance, for seeing the position of affairs, he addressed the\r\ndelinquent at once, and with the air of a man who knows what he is about\r\nand feels that he has the upper hand, said: \"What are you thinking\r\nabout? Get up, Senka. What are you doing, a clever chap like you? Be\r\nsensible, or I shall pull you out of bed if you are obstreperous. Don't\r\nbe obstreperous!\"\r\n\r\nThis brief but forcible speech surprised them all; still more were they\r\nsurprised when they noticed that Semyon Ivanovitch, hearing all this and\r\nseeing this person before him, was so flustered and reduced to such\r\nconfusion and dismay that he could scarcely mutter through his teeth in\r\na whisper the inevitable protest.\r\n\r\n\"Go away, you wretch,\" he said. \"You are a wretched creature--you are a\r\nthief! Do you hear? Do you understand? You are a great swell, my fine\r\ngentleman, you regular swell.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, my boy,\" Zimoveykin answered emphatically, retaining all his\r\npresence of mind, \"you're wrong there, you wise fellow, you regular\r\nProhartchin,\" Zimoveykin went on, parodying Semyon Ivanovitch and\r\nlooking round gleefully. \"Don't be obstreperous! Behave yourself, Senka,\r\nbehave yourself, or I'll give you away, I'll tell them all about it, my\r\nlad, do you understand?\"\r\n\r\nApparently Semyon Ivanovitch did understand, for he started when he\r\nheard the conclusion of the speech, and began looking rapidly about him\r\nwith an utterly desperate air.\r\n\r\nSatisfied with the effect, Mr. Zimoveykin would have continued, but Mark\r\nIvanovitch checked his zeal, and waiting till Semyon Ivanovitch was\r\nstill and almost calm again began judiciously impressing on the uneasy\r\ninvalid at great length that, \"to harbour ideas such as he now had in\r\nhis head was, first, useless, and secondly, not only useless, but\r\nharmful; and, in fact, not so much harmful as positively immoral; and\r\nthe cause of it all was that Semyon Ivanovitch was not only a bad\r\nexample, but led them all into temptation.\"\r\n\r\nEvery one expected satisfactory results from this speech. Moreover by\r\nnow Semyon Ivanovitch was quite quiet and replied in measured terms. A\r\nquiet discussion followed. They appealed to him in a friendly way,\r\ninquiring what he was so frightened of. Semyon Ivanovitch answered, but\r\nhis answers were irrelevant. They answered him, he answered them. There\r\nwere one or two more observations on both sides and then every one\r\nrushed into discussion, for suddenly such a strange and amazing subject\r\ncropped up, that they did not know how to express themselves. The\r\nargument at last led to impatience, impatience led to shouting, and\r\nshouting even to tears; and Mark Ivanovitch went away at last foaming at\r\nthe mouth and declaring that he had never known such a blockhead.\r\nOplevaniev spat in disgust, Okeanov was frightened, Zinovy Prokofyevitch\r\nbecame tearful, while Ustinya Fyodorovna positively howled, wailing that\r\nher lodger was leaving them and had gone off his head, that he would\r\ndie, poor dear man, without a passport and without telling any one,\r\nwhile she was a lone, lorn woman and that she would be dragged from\r\npillar to post. In fact, they all saw clearly at last that the seed they\r\nhad sown had yielded a hundred-fold, that the soil had been too\r\nproductive, and that in their company, Semyon Ivanovitch had succeeded\r\nin overstraining his wits completely and in the most irrevocable manner.\r\nEvery one subsided into silence, for though they saw that Semyon\r\nIvanovitch was frightened, the sympathetic friends were frightened too.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" cried Mark Ivanovitch; \"but what are you afraid of? What have\r\nyou gone off your head about? Who's thinking about you, my good sir?\r\nHave you the right to be afraid? Who are you? What are you? Nothing,\r\nsir. A round nought, sir, that is what you are. What are you making a\r\nfuss about? A woman has been run over in the street, so are you going to\r\nbe run over? Some drunkard did not take care of his pocket, but is that\r\nany reason why your coat-tails should be cut off? A house is burnt down,\r\nso your head is to be burnt off, is it? Is that it, sir, is that it?\"\r\n\r\n\"You ... you ... you stupid!\" muttered Semyon Ivanovitch, \"if your nose\r\nwere cut off you would eat it up with a bit of bread and not notice it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I may be a dandy,\" shouted Mark Ivanovitch, not listening; \"I may be a\r\nregular dandy, but I have not to pass an examination to get married--to\r\nlearn dancing; the ground is firm under me, sir. Why, my good man,\r\nhaven't you room enough? Is the floor giving way under your feet, or\r\nwhat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, they won't ask you, will they? They'll shut one up and that will\r\nbe the end of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"The end of it? That's what's up? What's your idea now, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, they kicked out the drunken cadger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but you see that was a drunkard, and you are a man, and so am I.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am a man. It's there all right one day and then it's gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gone! But what do you mean by it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, the office! The off--off--ice!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you blessed man, but of course the office is wanted and\r\nnecessary.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is wanted, I tell you; it's wanted to-day and it's wanted to-morrow,\r\nbut the day after to-morrow it will not be wanted. You have heard what\r\nhappened?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, but they'll pay you your salary for the year, you doubting Thomas,\r\nyou man of little faith. They'll put you into another job on account of\r\nyour age.\"\r\n\r\n\"Salary? But what if I have spent my salary, if thieves come and take my\r\nmoney? And I have a sister-in-law, do you hear? A sister-in-law! You\r\nbattering-ram....\"\r\n\r\n\"A sister-in-law! You are a man....\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am; I am a man. But you are a well-read gentleman and a fool, do\r\nyou hear?--you battering-ram--you regular battering-ram! That's what you\r\nare! I am not talking about your jokes; but there are jobs such that all\r\nof a sudden they are done away with. And Demid--do you hear?--Demid\r\nVassilyevitch says that the post will be done away with....\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, bless you, with your Demid! You sinner, why, you know....\"\r\n\r\n\"In a twinkling of an eye you'll be left without a post, then you'll\r\njust have to make the best of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you are simply raving, or clean off your head! Tell us plainly,\r\nwhat have you done? Own up if you have done something wrong! It's no use\r\nbeing ashamed! Are you off your head, my good man, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's off his head! He's gone off his head!\" they all cried, and wrung\r\ntheir hands in despair, while the landlady threw both her arms round\r\nMark Ivanovitch for fear he should tear Semyon Ivanovitch to pieces.\r\n\r\n\"You heathen, you heathenish soul, you wise man!\" Zimoveykin besought\r\nhim. \"Senka, you are not a man to take offence, you are a polite,\r\nprepossessing man. You are simple, you are good ... do you hear? It all\r\ncomes from your goodness. Here I am a ruffian and a fool, I am a beggar;\r\nbut good people haven't abandoned me, no fear; you see they treat me\r\nwith respect, I thank them and the landlady. Here, you see, I bow down\r\nto the ground to them; here, see, see, I am paying what is due to you,\r\nlandlady!\" At this point Zimoveykin swung off with pedantic dignity a\r\nlow bow right down to the ground.\r\n\r\nAfter that Semyon Ivanovitch would have gone on talking; but this time\r\nthey would not let him, they all intervened, began entreating him,\r\nassuring him, comforting him, and succeeded in making Semyon Ivanovitch\r\nthoroughly ashamed of himself, and at last, in a faint voice, he asked\r\nleave to explain himself.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then,\" he said, \"I am prepossessing, I am quiet, I am good,\r\nfaithful and devoted; to the last drop of my blood you know ... do you\r\nhear, you puppy, you swell? ... granted the job is going on, but you see\r\nI am poor. And what if they take it? do you hear, you swell? Hold your\r\ntongue and try to understand! They'll take it and that's all about it\r\n... it's going on, brother, and then not going on ... do you understand?\r\nAnd I shall go begging my bread, do you hear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Senka,\" Zimoveykin bawled frantically, drowning the general hubbub with\r\nhis voice. \"You are seditious! I'll inform against you! What are you\r\nsaying? Who are you? Are you a rebel, you sheep's head? A rowdy, stupid\r\nman they would turn off without a character. But what are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's just it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I am free, he's free, and here one lies and thinks....\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"What if they say I'm seditious?\"\r\n\r\n\"Se--di--tious? Senka, you seditious!\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay,\" cried Mr. Prohartchin, waving his hand and interrupting the\r\nrising uproar, \"that's not what I mean. Try to understand, only try to\r\nunderstand, you sheep. I am law-abiding. I am law-abiding to-day, I am\r\nlaw-abiding to-morrow, and then all of a sudden they kick me out and\r\ncall me seditious.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you saying?\" Mark Ivanovitch thundered at last, jumping up\r\nfrom the chair on which he had sat down to rest, running up to the bed\r\nand in a frenzy shaking with vexation and fury. \"What do you mean? You\r\nsheep! You've nothing to call your own. Why, are you the only person in\r\nthe world? Was the world made for you, do you suppose? Are you a\r\nNapoleon? What are you? Who are you? Are you a Napoleon, eh? Tell me,\r\nare you a Napoleon?\"\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Prohartchin did not answer this question. Not because he was\r\novercome with shame at being a Napoleon, and was afraid of taking upon\r\nhimself such a responsibility--no, he was incapable of disputing\r\nfurther, or saying anything.... His illness had reached a crisis. Tiny\r\nteardrops gushed suddenly from his glittering, feverish, grey eyes. He\r\nhid his burning head in his bony hands that were wasted by illness, sat\r\nup in bed, and sobbing, began to say that he was quite poor, that he was\r\na simple, unlucky man, that he was foolish and unlearned, he begged kind\r\nfolks to forgive him, to take care of him, to protect him, to give him\r\nfood and drink, not to leave him in want, and goodness knows what else\r\nSemyon Ivanovitch said. As he uttered this appeal he looked about him in\r\nwild terror, as though he were expecting the ceiling to fall or the\r\nfloor to give way. Every one felt his heart soften and move to pity as\r\nhe looked at the poor fellow. The landlady, sobbing and wailing like a\r\npeasant woman at her forlorn condition, laid the invalid back in bed\r\nwith her own hands. Mark Ivanovitch, seeing the uselessness of touching\r\nupon the memory of Napoleon, instantly relapsed into kindliness and came\r\nto her assistance. The others, in order to do something, suggested\r\nraspberry tea, saying that it always did good at once and that the\r\ninvalid would like it very much; but Zimoveykin contradicted them all,\r\nsaying there was nothing better than a good dose of camomile or\r\nsomething of the sort. As for Zinovy Prokofyevitch, having a good heart,\r\nhe sobbed and shed tears in his remorse, for having frightened Semyon\r\nIvanovitch with all sorts of absurdities, and gathering from the\r\ninvalid's last words that he was quite poor and needing assistance, he\r\nproceeded to get up a subscription for him, confining it for a time to\r\nthe tenants of the flat. Every one was sighing and moaning, every one\r\nfelt sorry and grieved, and yet all wondered how it was a man could be\r\nso completely panic-stricken. And what was he frightened about? It would\r\nhave been all very well if he had had a good post, had had a wife, a lot\r\nof children; it would have been excusable if he were being hauled up\r\nbefore the court on some charge or other; but he was a man utterly\r\ninsignificant, with nothing but a trunk and a German lock; he had been\r\nlying more than twenty years behind his screen, saying nothing, knowing\r\nnothing of the world nor of trouble, saving his half-pence, and now at a\r\nfrivolous, idle word the man had actually gone off his head, was utterly\r\npanic-stricken at the thought he might have a hard time of it.... And it\r\nnever occurred to him that every one has a hard time of it! \"If he would\r\nonly take that into consideration,\" Okeanov said afterwards, \"that we\r\nall have a hard time, then the man would have kept his head, would have\r\ngiven up his antics and would have put up with things, one way or\r\nanother.\"\r\n\r\nAll day long nothing was talked of but Semyon Ivanovitch. They went up\r\nto him, inquired after him, tried to comfort him; but by the evening he\r\nwas beyond that. The poor fellow began to be delirious, feverish. He\r\nsank into unconsciousness, so that they almost thought of sending for a\r\ndoctor; the lodgers all agreed together and undertook to watch over\r\nSemyon Ivanovitch and soothe him by turns through the night, and if\r\nanything happened to wake all the rest immediately. With the object of\r\nkeeping awake, they sat down to cards, setting beside the invalid his\r\nfriend, the drunken cadger, who had spent the whole day in the flat and\r\nhad asked leave to stay the night. As the game was played on credit and\r\nwas not at all interesting they soon got bored. They gave up the game,\r\nthen got into an argument about something, then began to be loud and\r\nnoisy, finally dispersed to their various corners, went on for a long\r\ntime angrily shouting and wrangling, and as all of them felt suddenly\r\nill-humoured they no longer cared to sit up, so went to sleep. Soon it\r\nwas as still in the flat as in an empty cellar, and it was the more like\r\none because it was horribly cold. The last to fall asleep was Okeanov.\r\n\"And it was between sleeping and waking,\" as he said afterwards, \"I\r\nfancied just before morning two men kept talking close by me.\" Okeanov\r\nsaid that he recognized Zimoveykin, and that Zimoveykin began waking his\r\nold friend Remnev just beside him, that they talked for a long time in a\r\nwhisper; then Zimoveykin went away and could be heard trying to unlock\r\nthe door into the kitchen. The key, the landlady declared afterwards,\r\nwas lying under her pillow and was lost that night. Finally--Okeanov\r\ntestified--he had fancied he had heard them go behind the screen to the\r\ninvalid and light a candle there, \"and I know nothing more,\" he said, \"I\r\nfell asleep, and woke up,\" as everybody else did, when every one in the\r\nflat jumped out of bed at the sound behind the screen of a shriek that\r\nwould have roused the dead, and it seemed to many of them that a candle\r\nwent out at that moment. A great hubbub arose, every one's heart stood\r\nstill; they rushed pell-mell at the shriek, but at that moment there was\r\na scuffle, with shouting, swearing, and fighting. They struck a light\r\nand saw that Zimoveykin and Remnev were fighting together, that they\r\nwere swearing and abusing one another, and as they turned the light on\r\nthem, one of them shouted: \"It's not me, it's this ruffian,\" and the\r\nother who was Zimoveykin, was shouting: \"Don't touch me, I've done\r\nnothing! I'll take my oath any minute!\" Both of them looked hardly like\r\nhuman beings; but for the first minute they had no attention to spare\r\nfor them; the invalid was not where he had been behind the screen. They\r\nimmediately parted the combatants and dragged them away, and saw that\r\nMr. Prohartchin was lying under the bed; he must, while completely\r\nunconscious, have dragged the quilt and pillow after him so that there\r\nwas nothing left on the bedstead but the bare mattress, old and greasy\r\n(he never had sheets). They pulled Semyon Ivanovitch out, stretched him\r\non the mattress, but soon realized that there was no need to make\r\ntrouble over him, that he was completely done for; his arms were stiff,\r\nand he seemed all to pieces. They stood over him, he still faintly\r\nshuddered and trembled all over, made an effort to do something with his\r\narms, could not utter a word, but blinked his eyes as they say heads do\r\nwhen still warm and bleeding, after being just chopped off by the\r\nexecutioner.\r\n\r\nAt last the body grew more and more still; the last faint convulsions\r\ndied away. Mr. Prohartchin had set off with his good deeds and his sins.\r\nWhether Semyon Ivanovitch had been frightened by something, whether he\r\nhad had a dream, as Remnev maintained afterwards, or there had been some\r\nother mischief--nobody knew; all that can be said is, that if the head\r\nclerk had made his appearance at that moment in the flat and had\r\nannounced that Semyon Ivanovitch was dismissed for sedition,\r\ninsubordination, and drunkenness; if some old draggle-tailed beggar\r\nwoman had come in at the door, calling herself Semyon Ivanovitch's\r\nsister-in-law; or if Semyon Ivanovitch had just received two hundred\r\nroubles as a reward; or if the house had caught fire and Semyon\r\nIvanovitch's head had been really burning--he would in all probability\r\nnot have deigned to stir a finger in any of these eventualities. While\r\nthe first stupefaction was passing over, while all present were\r\nregaining their powers of speech, were working themselves up into a\r\nfever of excitement, shouting and flying to conjectures and\r\nsuppositions; while Ustinya Fyodorovna was pulling the box from under\r\nhis bed, was rummaging in a fluster under the mattress and even in\r\nSemyon Ivanovitch's boots; while they cross-questioned Remnev and\r\nZimoveykin, Okeanov, who had hitherto been the quietest, humblest, and\r\nleast original of the lodgers, suddenly plucked up all his presence of\r\nmind and displayed all his latent talents, by taking up his hat and\r\nunder cover of the general uproar slipping out of the flat. And just\r\nwhen the horrors of disorder and anarchy had reached their height in the\r\nagitated flat, till then so tranquil, the door opened and suddenly there\r\ndescended upon them, like snow upon their heads, a personage of\r\ngentlemanly appearance, with a severe and displeased-looking face,\r\nbehind him Yaroslav Ilyitch, behind Yaroslav Ilyitch his subordinates\r\nand the functionaries whose duty it is to be present on such occasions,\r\nand behind them all, much embarrassed, Mr. Okeanov. The severe-looking\r\npersonage of gentlemanly appearance went straight up to Semyon\r\nIvanovitch, examined him, made a wry face, shrugged his shoulders and\r\nannounced what everybody knew, that is, that the dead man was dead, only\r\nadding that the same thing had happened a day or two ago to a gentleman\r\nof consequence, highly respected, who had died suddenly in his sleep.\r\nThen the personage of gentlemanly, but displeased-looking, appearance\r\nwalked away saying that they had troubled him for nothing, and took\r\nhimself off. His place was at once filled (while Remnev and Zimoveykin\r\nwere handed over to the custody of the proper functionaries), by\r\nYaroslav Ilyitch, who questioned some one, adroitly took possession of\r\nthe box, which the landlady was already trying to open, put the boots\r\nback in their proper place, observing that they were all in holes and no\r\nuse, asked for the pillow to be put back, called up Okeanov, asked for\r\nthe key of the box which was found in the pocket of the drunken cadger,\r\nand solemnly, in the presence of the proper officials, unlocked Semyon\r\nIvanovitch's property. Everything was displayed: two rags, a pair of\r\nsocks, half a handkerchief, an old hat, several buttons, some old soles,\r\nand the uppers of a pair of boots, that is, all sorts of odds and ends,\r\nscraps, rubbish, trash, which had a stale smell. The only thing of any\r\nvalue was the German lock. They called up Okeanov and cross-questioned\r\nhim sternly; but Okeanov was ready to take his oath. They asked for the\r\npillow, they examined it; it was extremely dirty, but in other respects\r\nit was like all other pillows. They attacked the mattress, they were\r\nabout to lift it up, but stopped for a moment's consideration, when\r\nsuddenly and quite unexpectedly something heavy fell with a clink on the\r\nfloor. They bent down and saw on the floor a screw of paper and in the\r\nscrew some dozen roubles. \"A-hey!\" said Yaroslav Ilyitch, pointing to a\r\nslit in the mattress from which hair and stuffing were sticking out.\r\nThey examined the slit and found that it had only just been made with a\r\nknife and was half a yard in length; they thrust hands into the gap and\r\npulled out a kitchen knife, probably hurriedly thrust in there after\r\nslitting the mattress. Before Yaroslav Ilyitch had time to pull the\r\nknife out of the slit and to say \"A-hey!\" again, another screw of money\r\nfell out, and after it, one at a time, two half roubles, a quarter\r\nrouble, then some small change, and an old-fashioned, solid five-kopeck\r\npiece--all this was seized upon. At this point it was realized that it\r\nwould not be amiss to cut up the whole mattress with scissors. They\r\nasked for scissors.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the guttering candle lighted up a scene that would have been\r\nextremely curious to a spectator. About a dozen lodgers were grouped\r\nround the bed in the most picturesque costumes, all unbrushed, unshaven,\r\nunwashed, sleepy-looking, just as they had gone to bed. Some were quite\r\npale, while others had drops of sweat upon their brows: some were\r\nshuddering, while others looked feverish. The landlady, utterly\r\nstupefied, was standing quietly with her hands folded waiting for\r\nYaroslav Ilyitch's good pleasure. From the stove above, the heads of\r\nAvdotya, the servant, and the landlady's favourite cat looked down with\r\nfrightened curiosity. The torn and broken screen lay cast on the floor,\r\nthe open box displayed its uninviting contents, the quilt and pillow lay\r\ntossed at random, covered with fluff from the mattress, and on the\r\nthree-legged wooden table gleamed the steadily growing heap of silver\r\nand other coins. Only Semyon Ivanovitch preserved his composure, lying\r\ncalmly on the bed and seeming to have no foreboding of his ruin. When\r\nthe scissors had been brought and Yaroslav Ilyitch's assistant, wishing\r\nto be of service, shook the mattress rather impatiently to ease it from\r\nunder the back of its owner, Semyon Ivanovitch with his habitual\r\ncivility made room a little, rolling on his side with his back to the\r\nsearchers; then at a second shake he turned on his face, finally gave\r\nway still further, and as the last slat in the bedstead was missing, he\r\nsuddenly and quite unexpectedly plunged head downward, leaving in view\r\nonly two bony, thin, blue legs, which stuck upwards like two branches of\r\na charred tree. As this was the second time that morning that Mr.\r\nProhartchin had poked his head under his bed it at once aroused\r\nsuspicion, and some of the lodgers, headed by Zinovy Prokofyevitch,\r\ncrept under it, with the intention of seeing whether there were\r\nsomething hidden there too. But they knocked their heads together for\r\nnothing, and as Yaroslav Ilyitch shouted to them, bidding them release\r\nSemyon Ivanovitch at once from his unpleasant position, two of the more\r\nsensible seized each a leg, dragged the unsuspected capitalist into the\r\nlight of day and laid him across the bed. Meanwhile the hair and flock\r\nwere flying about, the heap of silver grew--and, my goodness, what a lot\r\nthere was!... Noble silver roubles, stout solid rouble and a half\r\npieces, pretty half rouble coins, plebeian quarter roubles, twenty\r\nkopeck pieces, even the unpromising old crone's small fry of ten and\r\nfive kopeck silver pieces--all done up in separate bits of paper in the\r\nmost methodical and systematic way; there were curiosities also, two\r\ncounters of some sort, one napoleon d'or, one very rare coin of some\r\nunknown kind.... Some of the roubles were of the greatest antiquity,\r\nthey were rubbed and hacked coins of Elizabeth, German kreutzers, coins\r\nof Peter, of Catherine; there were, for instance, old fifteen-kopeck\r\npieces, now very rare, pierced for wearing as earrings, all much worn,\r\nyet with the requisite number of dots ... there was even copper, but all\r\nof that was green and tarnished.... They found one red note, but no\r\nmore. At last, when the dissection was quite over and the mattress case\r\nhad been shaken more than once without a clink, they piled all the money\r\non the table and set to work to count it. At the first glance one might\r\nwell have been deceived and have estimated it at a million, it was such\r\nan immense heap. But it was not a million, though it did turn out to be\r\na very considerable sum--exactly 2497 roubles and a half--so that if\r\nZinovy Prokofyevitch's subscription had been raised the day before there\r\nwould perhaps have been just 2500 roubles. They took the money, they put\r\na seal on the dead man's box, they listened to the landlady's\r\ncomplaints, and informed her when and where she ought to lodge\r\ninformation in regard to the dead man's little debt to her. A receipt\r\nwas taken from the proper person. At that point hints were dropped in\r\nregard to the sister-in-law; but being persuaded that in a certain sense\r\nthe sister-in-law was a myth, that is, a product of the defective\r\nimagination with which they had more than once reproached Semyon\r\nIvanovitch--they abandoned the idea as useless, mischievous and\r\ndisadvantageous to the good name of Mr. Prohartchin, and so the matter\r\nended.\r\n\r\nWhen the first shock was over, when the lodgers had recovered themselves\r\nand realized the sort of person their late companion had been, they all\r\nsubsided, relapsed into silence and began looking distrustfully at one\r\nanother. Some seemed to take Semyon Ivanovitch's behaviour very much to\r\nheart, and even to feel affronted by it. What a fortune! So the man had\r\nsaved up like this! Not losing his composure, Mark Ivanovitch proceeded\r\nto explain why Semyon Ivanovitch had been so suddenly panic-stricken;\r\nbut they did not listen to him. Zinovy Prokofyevitch was very\r\nthoughtful, Okeanov had had a little to drink, the others seemed rather\r\ncrestfallen, while a little man called Kantarev, with a nose like a\r\nsparrow's beak, left the flat that evening after very carefully packing\r\nup and cording all his boxes and bags, and coldly explaining to the\r\ncurious that times were hard and that the terms here were beyond his\r\nmeans. The landlady wailed without ceasing, lamenting for Semyon\r\nIvanovitch, and cursing him for having taken advantage of her lone, lorn\r\nstate. Mark Ivanovitch was asked why the dead man had not taken his\r\nmoney to the bank. \"He was too simple, my good soul, he hadn't enough\r\nimagination,\" answered Mark Ivanovitch.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and you have been too simple, too, my good woman,\" Okeanov put in.\r\n\"For twenty years the man kept himself close here in your flat, and here\r\nhe's been knocked down by a feather--while you went on cooking\r\ncabbage-soup and had no time to notice it.... Ah-ah, my good woman!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the poor dear,\" the landlady went on, \"what need of a bank! If he'd\r\nbrought me his pile and said to me: 'Take it, Ustinyushka, poor dear,\r\nhere is all I have, keep and board me in my helplessness, so long as I\r\nam on earth,' then, by the holy ikon I would have fed him, I would have\r\ngiven him drink, I would have looked after him. Ah, the sinner! ah, the\r\ndeceiver! He deceived me, he cheated me, a poor lone woman!\"\r\n\r\nThey went up to the bed again. Semyon Ivanovitch was lying properly now,\r\ndressed in his best, though, indeed, it was his only suit, hiding his\r\nrigid chin behind a cravat which was tied rather awkwardly, washed,\r\nbrushed, but not quite shaven, because there was no razor in the flat;\r\nthe only one, which had belonged to Zinovy Prokofyevitch, had lost its\r\nedge a year ago and had been very profitably sold at Tolkutchy Market;\r\nthe others used to go to the barber's.\r\n\r\nThey had not yet had time to clear up the disorder. The broken screen\r\nlay as before, and exposing Semyon Ivanovitch's seclusion, seemed like\r\nan emblem of the fact that death tears away the veil from all our\r\nsecrets, our shifty dodges and intrigues. The stuffing from the mattress\r\nlay about in heaps. The whole room, suddenly so still, might well have\r\nbeen compared by a poet to the ruined nest of a swallow, broken down and\r\ntorn to pieces by the storm, the nestlings and their mother killed, and\r\ntheir warm little bed of fluff, feather and flock scattered about\r\nthem.... Semyon Ivanovitch, however, looked more like a conceited,\r\nthievish old cock-sparrow. He kept quite quiet now, seemed to be lying\r\nlow, as though he were not guilty, as though he had had nothing to do\r\nwith the shameless, conscienceless, and unseemly duping and deception of\r\nall these good people. He did not heed now the sobs and wailing of his\r\nbereaved and wounded landlady. On the contrary, like a wary, callous\r\ncapitalist, anxious not to waste a minute in idleness even in the\r\ncoffin, he seemed to be wrapped up in some speculative calculation.\r\nThere was a look of deep reflection in his face, while his lips were\r\ndrawn together with a significant air, of which Semyon Ivanovitch during\r\nhis lifetime had not been suspected of being capable. He seemed, as it\r\nwere, to have grown shrewder, his right eye was, as it were, slyly\r\nscrewed up. Semyon Ivanovitch seemed wanting to say something, to make\r\nsome very important communication and explanation and without loss of\r\ntime, because things were complicated and there was not a minute to\r\nlose.... And it seemed as though they could hear him.\r\n\r\n\"What is it? Give over, do you hear, you stupid woman? Don't whine! Go\r\nto bed and sleep it off, my good woman, do you hear? I am dead; there's\r\nno need of a fuss now. What's the use of it, really? It's nice to lie\r\nhere.... Though I don't mean that, do you hear? You are a fine lady, you\r\nare a regular fine lady. Understand that; here I am dead now, but look\r\nhere, what if--that is, perhaps it can't be so--but I say what if I'm\r\nnot dead, what if I get up, do you hear? What would happen then?\"\r\n\n PRINTED IN GREAT BRITAIN BY RICHARD CLAY & SONS, LIMITED,\r\n BRUNSWICK ST., STAMFORD ST., S.E. 1, AND BUNGAY, SUFFOLK\r\n\n NOVELS BY FYODOR DOSTOEVSKY\r\n\r\n Translated from the Russian by\r\n CONSTANCE GARNETT.\r\n\n THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV\r\n THE IDIOT\r\n THE POSSESSED\r\n CRIME AND PUNISHMENT\r\n THE HOUSE OF THE DEAD\r\n THE INSULTED AND INJURED\r\n A RAW YOUTH\r\n THE ETERNAL HUSBAND, etc.\r\n THE GAMBLER, etc.\r\n WHITE NIGHTS, etc.\r\n AN HONEST THIEF, etc. (_shortly_)\r\n THE FRIEND OF THE FAMILY (_in progress_)\r\n\n NOVELS BY IVAN TURGENEV\r\n\r\n Translated from the Russian by\r\n CONSTANCE GARNETT.\r\n\n RUDIN\r\n A HOUSE OF GENTLEFOLK\r\n ON THE EVE\r\n FATHERS AND CHILDREN\r\n SMOKE\r\n VIRGIN SOIL (2 vols.)\r\n A SPORTSMAN'S SKETCHES (2 vols.)\r\n DREAM TALES AND PROSE POEMS\r\n THE TORRENTS OF SPRING\r\n A LEAR OF THE STEPPES, etc.\r\n THE DIARY OF A SUPERFLUOUS MAN, etc.\r\n A DESPERATE CHARACTER, etc.\r\n THE JEW, etc.\r\n\n NEW YORK\r\n THE MACMILLAN COMPANY\r\n\nTranscriber's Notes:\r\n\r\nThe list of novels translated by Constance Garnett was moved from front\r\nof book to the end.
