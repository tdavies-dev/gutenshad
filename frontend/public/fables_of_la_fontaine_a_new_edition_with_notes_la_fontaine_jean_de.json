      "title": "I.--THE GRASSHOPPER AND THE ANT.[1]",
      "content": "A Grasshopper gay\r\n Sang the summer away,\r\n And found herself poor\r\n By the winter's first roar.\r\n Of meat or of bread,\r\n Not a morsel she had!\r\n So a begging she went,\r\n To her neighbour the ant,\r\n For the loan of some wheat,\r\n Which would serve her to eat,\r\n Till the season came round.\r\n 'I will pay you,' she saith,\r\n 'On an animal's faith,\r\n Double weight in the pound\r\n Ere the harvest be bound.'\r\n The ant is a friend\r\n (And here she might mend)\r\n Little given to lend.\r\n 'How spent you the summer?'\r\n Quoth she, looking shame\r\n At the borrowing dame.\r\n 'Night and day to each comer\r\n I sang, if you please.'\r\n 'You sang! I'm at ease;\r\n For 'tis plain at a glance,\r\n Now, ma'am, you must dance.'\r\n\r\n[1] For the story of this fable, as for the stories of so many of the\r\n fables which follow, especially in the first six books, La Fontaine\r\n is indebted to the Father of Fable, Aesop the Phrygian. See account\r\n of Aesop in the Translator's Preface."

      "content": "Perch'd on a lofty oak,\r\n Sir Raven held a lunch of cheese;\r\n Sir Fox, who smelt it in the breeze,\r\n Thus to the holder spoke:--\r\n 'Ha! how do you do, Sir Raven?\r\n Well, your coat, sir, is a brave one!\r\n So black and glossy, on my word, sir,\r\n With voice to match, you were a bird, sir,\r\n Well fit to be the Phoenix of these days.'\r\n Sir Raven, overset with praise,\r\n Must show how musical his croak.\r\n Down fell the luncheon from the oak;\r\n Which snatching up, Sir Fox thus spoke:--\r\n 'The flatterer, my good sir,\r\n Aye liveth on his listener;\r\n Which lesson, if you please,\r\n Is doubtless worth the cheese.'\r\n A bit too late, Sir Raven swore\r\n The rogue should never cheat him more.\r\n\r\n[2] Both Aesop and Phaedrus have a version of this fable."

      "title": "III.--THE FROG THAT WISHED TO BE AS BIG AS THE OX.[3]",
      "content": "The tenant of a bog,\r\n An envious little frog,\r\n Not bigger than an egg,\r\n A stately bullock spies,\r\n And, smitten with his size,\r\n Attempts to be as big.\r\n With earnestness and pains,\r\n She stretches, swells, and strains,\r\n And says, 'Sis Frog, look here! see me!\r\n Is this enough?' 'No, no.'\r\n 'Well, then, is this?' 'Poh! poh!\r\n Enough! you don't begin to be.'\r\n And thus the reptile sits,\r\n Enlarging till she splits.\r\n The world is full of folks\r\n Of just such wisdom;--\r\n The lordly dome provokes\r\n The cit to build his dome;\r\n And, really, there is no telling\r\n How much great men set little ones a swelling.\r\n\r\n[3] The story of this fable is given in Horace, _Satires_, II. 3,\r\n Phaedrus and Corrozet have also versions of it. For an account of\r\n Phaedrus and his Fables see the Translator's Preface. Gilles Corrozet\r\n was one of the French fabulists immediately preceding La Fontaine.\r\n He was a Parisian bookseller-author who lived between 1516 and 1568."

      "content": "Two mules were bearing on their backs,\r\n One, oats; the other, silver of the tax.[4]\r\n The latter glorying in his load,\r\n March'd proudly forward on the road;\r\n And, from the jingle of his bell,\r\n 'Twas plain he liked his burden well.\r\n But in a wild-wood glen\r\n A band of robber men\r\n Rush'd forth upon the twain.\r\n Well with the silver pleased,\r\n They by the bridle seized\r\n The treasure-mule so vain.\r\n Poor mule! in struggling to repel\r\n His ruthless foes, he fell\r\n Stabb'd through; and with a bitter sighing,\r\n He cried, 'Is this the lot they promised me?\r\n My humble friend from danger free,\r\n While, weltering in my gore, I'm dying?'\r\n 'My friend,' his fellow-mule replied,\r\n 'It is not well to have one's work too high.\r\n If thou hadst been a miller's drudge, as I,\r\n Thou wouldst not thus have died.'\r\n\r\n[4] _The silver of the tax_.--An allusion to the French _gabelle_, or\r\n old salt tax, which, like all taxes levied upon the mass of the\r\n people, was a very productive one. Its collection caused several\r\n peasants' insurrections."

      "content": "A prowling wolf, whose shaggy skin\r\n (So strict the watch of dogs had been)\r\n Hid little but his bones,\r\n Once met a mastiff dog astray.\r\n A prouder, fatter, sleeker Tray,\r\n No human mortal owns.\r\n Sir Wolf in famish'd plight,\r\n Would fain have made a ration\r\n Upon his fat relation;\r\n But then he first must fight;\r\n And well the dog seem'd able\r\n To save from wolfish table\r\n His carcass snug and tight.\r\n So, then, in civil conversation\r\n The wolf express'd his admiration\r\n Of Tray's fine case. Said Tray, politely,\r\n 'Yourself, good sir, may be as sightly;\r\n Quit but the woods, advised by me.\r\n For all your fellows here, I see,\r\n Are shabby wretches, lean and gaunt,\r\n Belike to die of haggard want.\r\n With such a pack, of course it follows,\r\n One fights for every bit he swallows.\r\n Come, then, with me, and share\r\n On equal terms our princely fare.'\r\n 'But what with you\r\n Has one to do?'\r\n Inquires the wolf. 'Light work indeed,'\r\n Replies the dog; 'you only need\r\n To bark a little now and then,\r\n To chase off duns and beggar men,\r\n To fawn on friends that come or go forth,\r\n Your master please, and so forth;\r\n For which you have to eat\r\n All sorts of well-cook'd meat--\r\n Cold pullets, pigeons, savoury messes--\r\n Besides unnumber'd fond caresses.'\r\n The wolf, by force of appetite,\r\n Accepts the terms outright,\r\n Tears glistening in his eyes.\r\n But faring on, he spies\r\n A gall'd spot on the mastiff's neck.\r\n 'What's that?' he cries. 'O, nothing but a speck.'\r\n 'A speck?' 'Ay, ay; 'tis not enough to pain me;\r\n Perhaps the collar's mark by which they chain me.'\r\n 'Chain! chain you! What! run you not, then,\r\n Just where you please, and when?'\r\n 'Not always, sir; but what of that?'\r\n 'Enough for me, to spoil your fat!\r\n It ought to be a precious price\r\n Which could to servile chains entice;\r\n For me, I'll shun them while I've wit.'\r\n So ran Sir Wolf, and runneth yet.\r\n\r\n[5] Phaedrus, III. 7.--The references to the Fables of Phaedrus are to\r\n Bohn's edition, which is from the critical edition of Orellius, 1831."

And now, my bonny birds,\r\n Though you have disbelieved my words\r\n Thus far, take heed at last,--\r\n When you shall see the seed-time past,\r\n And men, no crops to labour for,\r\n On birds shall wage their cruel war,\r\n With deadly net and noose;\r\n Of flying then beware,\r\n Unless you take the air,\r\n Like woodcock, crane, or goose.\r\n But stop; you're not in plight\r\n For such adventurous flight,\r\n O'er desert waves and sands,\r\n In search of other lands.\r\n Hence, then, to save your precious souls,\r\n Remaineth but to say,\r\n 'Twill be the safest way,\r\n To chuck yourselves in holes.'\r\n Before she had thus far gone,\r\n The birdlings, tired of hearing,\r\n And laughing more than fearing,\r\n Set up a greater jargon\r\n Than did, before the Trojan slaughter,\r\n The Trojans round old Priam's daughter.[9]\r\n And many a bird, in prison grate,\r\n Lamented soon a Trojan fate.\r\n\r\n 'Tis thus we heed no instincts but our own;\r\n Believe no evil till the evil's done.\r\n\r\n[8] Aesop.\r\n[9] _Priam's daughter_.--Cassandra, who predicted the fall of Troy, and\r\n was not heeded."

The Duke De La Rochefoucauld.\r\n\r\n A man, who had no rivals in the love\r\n Which to himself he bore,\r\n Esteem'd his own dear beauty far above\r\n What earth had seen before.\r\n More than contented in his error,\r\n He lived the foe of every mirror.\r\n Officious fate, resolved our lover\r\n From such an illness should recover,\r\n Presented always to his eyes\r\n The mute advisers which the ladies prize;--\r\n Mirrors in parlours, inns, and shops,--\r\n Mirrors the pocket furniture of fops,--\r\n Mirrors on every lady's zone,[13]\r\n From which his face reflected shone.\r\n What could our dear Narcissus do?\r\n From haunts of men he now withdrew,\r\n On purpose that his precious shape\r\n From every mirror might escape.\r\n But in his forest glen alone,\r\n Apart from human trace,\r\n A watercourse,\r\n Of purest source,\r\n While with unconscious gaze\r\n He pierced its waveless face,\r\n Reflected back his own.\r\n Incensed with mingled rage and fright,\r\n He seeks to shun the odious sight;\r\n But yet that mirror sheet, so clear and still,\r\n He cannot leave, do what he will.\r\n\r\n Ere this, my story's drift you plainly see.\r\n From such mistake there is no mortal free.\r\n That obstinate self-lover\r\n The human soul doth cover;\r\n The mirrors follies are of others,\r\n In which, as all are genuine brothers,\r\n Each soul may see to life depicted\r\n Itself with just such faults afflicted;\r\n And by that charming placid brook,\r\n Needless to say, I mean your Maxim Book.\r\n\r\n[12] This is one of La Fontaine's most admired fables, and is one of the\r\n few for which he did not go for the groundwork to some older\r\n fabulist. The Duke de la Rochefoucauld, to whom it was dedicated,\r\n was the author of the famous \"Reflexions et Maximes Morales,\" which\r\n La Fontaine praises in the last lines of his fable. La\r\n Rochefoucauld was La Fontaine's friend and patron. The \"Maximes\"\r\n had achieved a second edition just prior to La Fontaine's\r\n publication of this first series of his Fables, in 1668. \"The\r\n Rabbits\" (Book X., Fable 15.), published in the second collection,\r\n in 1678-9, is also dedicated to the Duke, who died the following\r\n year, 1680. See Translator's Preface.\r\n[13] _Lady's zone_.--One of La Fontaine's commentators remarks upon\r\n this passage that it is no exaggeration of the foppishness of the\r\n times in which the poet wrote, and cites the instance that the\r\n canons of St. Martin of Tours wore mirrors on their shoes, even\r\n while officiating in church."

He leaves the table,\r\n No loss at all to 'ts noisy gabble.\r\n The men were Leda's twins, who knew\r\n What to a poet's praise was due,\r\n And, thanking, paid him by foretelling\r\n The downfall of the wrestler's dwelling.\r\n From which ill-fated pile, indeed,\r\n No sooner was the poet freed,\r\n Than, props and pillars failing,\r\n Which held aloft the ceiling\r\n So splendid o'er them,\r\n It downward loudly crash'd,\r\n The plates and flagons dash'd,\r\n And men who bore them;\r\n And, what was worse,\r\n Full vengeance for the man of verse,\r\n A timber broke the wrestler's thighs,\r\n And wounded many otherwise.\r\n The gossip Fame, of course, took care\r\n Abroad to publish this affair.\r\n 'A miracle!' the public cried, delighted.\r\n No more could god-beloved bard be slighted.\r\n His verse now brought him more than double,\r\n With neither duns, nor care, nor trouble.\r\n Whoe'er laid claim to noble birth\r\n Must buy his ancestors a slice,\r\n Resolved no nobleman on earth\r\n Should overgo him in the price.\r\n From which these serious lessons flow:--\r\n Fail not your praises to bestow\r\n On gods and godlike men. Again,\r\n To sell the product of her pain\r\n Is not degrading to the Muse.\r\n Indeed, her art they do abuse,\r\n Who think her wares to use,\r\n And yet a liberal pay refuse.\r\n Whate'er the great confer upon her,\r\n They're honour'd by it while they honour.\r\n Of old, Olympus and Parnassus\r\n In friendship heaved their sky-crown'd masses.\r\n\r\n[17] Phaedrus, IV. 24.\r\n[18] _Malherbe_.--See note to Fable I., Book III."

For ten long years the men of Troy,\r\n By means that only heroes can employ,\r\n Had held the allied hosts of Greece at bay,--\r\n Their minings, batterings, stormings day by day,\r\n Their hundred battles on the crimson plain,\r\n Their blood of thousand heroes, all in vain,--\r\n When, by Minerva's art, a horse of wood,\r\n Of lofty size before their city stood,\r\n Whose flanks immense the sage Ulysses hold,\r\n Brave Diomed, and Ajax fierce and bold,\r\n Whom, with their myrmidons, the huge machine\r\n Would bear within the fated town unseen,\r\n To wreak upon its very gods their rage--\r\n Unheard-of stratagem, in any age.\r\n Which well its crafty authors did repay....\r\n 'Enough, enough,' our critic folks will say;\r\n 'Your period excites alarm,\r\n Lest you should do your lungs some harm;\r\n And then your monstrous wooden horse,\r\n With squadrons in it at their ease,\r\n Is even harder to endorse\r\n Than Renard cheating Raven of his cheese.\r\n And, more than that, it fits you ill\r\n To wield the old heroic quill.'\r\n Well, then, a humbler tone, if such your will is:--\r\n Long sigh'd and pined the jealous Amaryllis\r\n For her Alcippus, in the sad belief,\r\n None, save her sheep and dog, would know her grief.\r\n Thyrsis, who knows, among the willows slips,\r\n And hears the gentle shepherdess's lips\r\n Beseech the kind and gentle zephyr\r\n To bear these accents to her lover....\r\n 'Stop!' says my censor:\r\n 'To laws of rhyme quite irreducible,\r\n That couplet needs again the crucible;\r\n Poetic men, sir,\r\n Must nicely shun the shocks\r\n Of rhymes unorthodox.'\r\n A curse on critics! hold your tongue!\r\n Know I not how to end my song?\r\n Of time and strength what greater waste\r\n Than my attempt to suit your taste?\r\n\r\n Some men, more nice than wise,\r\n There's nought that satisfies.\r\n\n[1] Phaedrus, Book IV. 7.\r\n[2] _The plants and trees_.--Aristotle's rule for pure fable is\r\n that its _dramatis personae_ should be animals only--excluding\r\n man. Dr. Johnson (writing upon Gay's Fables) agrees in this dictum\r\n \"generally.\" But hardly any of the fabulists, from Aesop downwards,\r\n seem to have bound themselves by the rule; and in this fable we have\r\n La Fontaine rather exulting in his assignment of speech, &c., not\r\n only to the lower animals but to \"plants and trees,\" &c., as well as\r\n otherwise defying the \"hard to suit,\" _i.e._, the critics.\r\n[3] _Half-a-dozen baby stories_.--Here La Fontaine exalts his muse\r\n as a fabulist. This is in reply to certain of his critics who\r\n pronounced his work puerile, and pretended to wish him to adopt the\r\n higher forms of poetry. Some of the fables of the first six Books\r\n were originally published in a semi-private way before 1668. See the\r\n Translators Preface.

Their enemy, this time,\r\n Upsoaring to a place sublime,\r\n Let fall upon his royal robes some dirt,\r\n Which Jove just shaking, with a sudden flirt,\r\n Threw out the eggs, no one knows whither.\r\n When Jupiter inform'd her how th' event\r\n Occurr'd by purest accident,\r\n The eagle raved; there was no reasoning with her;\r\n She gave out threats of leaving court,\r\n To make the desert her resort,\r\n And other brav'ries of this sort.\r\n Poor Jupiter in silence heard\r\n The uproar of his favourite bird.\r\n Before his throne the beetle now appear'd,\r\n And by a clear complaint the mystery clear'd.\r\n The god pronounced the eagle in the wrong.\r\n But still, their hatred was so old and strong,\r\n These enemies could not be reconciled;\r\n And, that the general peace might not be spoil'd,--\r\n The best that he could do,--the god arranged,\r\n That thence the eagle's pairing should be changed,\r\n To come when beetle folks are only found\r\n Conceal'd and dormant under ground.\r\n\r\n[14] Aesop."

De Maucroix.[2]\r\n\r\n Because the arts are plainly birthright matters,\r\n For fables we to ancient Greece are debtors;\r\n But still this field could not be reap'd so clean\r\n As not to let us, later comers, glean.\r\n The fiction-world hath deserts yet to dare,\r\n And, daily, authors make discoveries there.\r\n I'd fain repeat one which our man of song,\r\n Old Malherbe, told one day to young Racan.[3]\r\n Of Horace they the rivals and the heirs,\r\n Apollo's pets,--my masters, I should say,--\r\n Sole by themselves were met, I'm told, one day,\r\n Confiding each to each their thoughts and cares.\r\n Racan begins:--'Pray end my inward strife,\r\n For well you know, my friend, what's what in life,\r\n Who through its varied course, from stage to stage,\r\n Have stored the full experience of age;\r\n What shall I do? 'Tis time I chose profession.\r\n You know my fortune, birth, and disposition.\r\n Ought I to make the country my resort,\r\n Or seek the army, or to rise at court?\r\n There's nought but mixeth bitterness with charms;\r\n War hath its pleasures; hymen, its alarms.\r\n 'Twere nothing hard to take my natural bent,--\r\n But I've a world of people to content.'\r\n 'Content a world!' old Malherbe cries; 'who can, sir?\r\n Why, let me tell a story ere I answer.'\r\n\r\n 'A miller and his son, I've somewhere read,\r\n The first in years, the other but a lad,--\r\n A fine, smart boy, however, I should say,--\r\n To sell their ass went to a fair one day.\r\n In order there to get the highest price,\r\n They needs must keep their donkey fresh and nice;\r\n So, tying fast his feet, they swung him clear,\r\n And bore him hanging like a chandelier.\r\n Alas! poor, simple-minded country fellows!\r\n The first that sees their load, loud laughing, bellows,\r\n \"What farce is this to split good people's sides?\r\n The most an ass is not the one that rides!\"\r\n The miller, much enlighten'd by this talk,\r\n Untied his precious beast, and made him walk.\r\n The ass, who liked the other mode of travel,\r\n Bray'd some complaint at trudging on the gravel;\r\n Whereat, not understanding well the beast,\r\n The miller caused his hopeful son to ride,\r\n And walk'd behind, without a spark of pride.\r\n Three merchants pass'd, and, mightily displeased,\r\n The eldest of these gentlemen cried out,\r\n \"Ho there! dismount, for shame, you lubber lout!\r\n Nor make a foot-boy of your grey-beard sire;\r\n Change places, as the rights of age require.\"\r\n \"To please you, sirs,\" the miller said, \"I ought.\"\r\n So down the young and up the old man got.\r\n Three girls next passing, \"What a shame!\" says one,\r\n \"That boy should be obliged on foot to run,\r\n While that old chap, upon his ass astride,\r\n Should play the calf, and like a bishop ride!\"\r\n \"Please save your wit,\" the miller made reply,\r\n \"Tough veal, my girls, the calf as old as I.\"\r\n But joke on joke repeated changed his mind;\r\n So up he took, at last, his son behind.\r\n Not thirty yards ahead, another set\r\n Found fault. \"The biggest fools I ever met,\"\r\n Says one of them, \"such burdens to impose.\r\n The ass is faint, and dying with their blows.\r\n Is this, indeed, the mercy which these rustics\r\n Show to their honest, faithful, old domestics?\r\n If to the fair these lazy fellows ride,\r\n 'Twill be to sell thereat the donkey's hide!\"\r\n \"Zounds!\" cried the miller, \"precious little brains\r\n Hath he who takes, to please the world, such pains;\r\n But since we're in, we'll try what can be done.\"\r\n So off the ass they jump'd, himself and son,\r\n And, like a prelate, donkey march'd alone.\r\n Another man they met. \"These folks,\" said he,\r\n \"Enslave themselves to let their ass go free--\r\n The darling brute! If I might be so bold,\r\n I'd counsel them to have him set in gold.\r\n Not so went Nicholas his Jane[4] to woo,\r\n Who rode, we sing, his ass to save his shoe.\"\r\n \"Ass! ass!\" our man replied; \"we're asses three!\r\n I do avow myself an ass to be;\r\n But since my sage advisers can't agree,\r\n Their words henceforth shall not be heeded;\r\n I'll suit myself.\" And he succeeded.\r\n\r\n 'For you, choose army, love, or court;\r\n In town, or country, make resort;\r\n Take wife, or cowl; ride you, or walk;\r\n Doubt not but tongues will have their talk.'\r\n\r\n[1] The story of this fable has been used by most of the fabulists, from\r\n Aesop downwards.\r\n[2] In the original editions this fable is dedicated \"A. M. D. M.\" which\r\n initials stand for \"To M. De Maucroix,\" Canon of Rheims, an early and\r\n late friend and patron of the poet. See Translator's Preface.\r\n[3] _Old Malherbe and young Racan._--French poets. Malherbe was\r\n born in 1556, and died in 1628. La Fontaine owed to Malherbe's works\r\n the happy inspiration which led him to write poetry. See Translator's\r\n Preface. Honorat de Bueil, Marquis de Racan, was born at La Roche\r\n Racan in 1589. As a poet he was a pupil of Malherbe. His works\r\n were praised by Boileau, and he was one of the earliest members of\r\n the French Academy.\r\n[4] _Nicholas and his Jane._--An allusion to an old French song."

Rabelais also has a version: Book III. ch. 3.\r\n[6] _Boss_.--A word probably more familiar to hod-carriers than to\r\n lexicographers; qu. derived from the French _bosseman_, or the\r\n English _boatswain_, pronounced _bos'n_? It denotes a \"master\" of\r\n some practical \"art.\" Master Belly, says Rabelais, was the first\r\n Master of Arts in the world.--Translator. The name used by La\r\n Fontaine is \"Messer Gaster.\" To which he puts a footnote stating\r\n that he meant \"L'estomac.\" He took the name from Rabelais, Book IV.,\r\n ch. 57, where it occurs thus:--\"Messer Gaster est le premier maÃ®tre\r\n Ã¨s arts de ce monde.... Son mandement est nommÃ©: Faire le fault,\r\n sans delay, ou mourir.\"\r\n[7] _Menenius_.--See Translator's Preface.\r\n[8] _Rome_.--According to our republican notions of government,\r\n these people were somewhat imposed upon. Perhaps the fable finds a\r\n more appropriate application in the relation of employer to employed.\r\n I leave the fabulists and the political economists to settle the\r\n question between them.--Translator."

The woodman answer'd, 'Nay.'\r\n An axe of silver, bright and gay,\r\n Refused the honest woodman too.\r\n At last the finder brought to view\r\n An axe of iron, steel, and wood.\r\n 'That's mine,' he said, in joyful mood;\r\n 'With that I'll quite contented be.'\r\n The god replied, 'I give the three,\r\n As due reward of honesty.'\r\n This luck when neighbouring choppers knew,\r\n They lost their axes, not a few,\r\n And sent their prayers to Jupiter\r\n So fast, he knew not which to hear.\r\n His winged son, however, sent\r\n With gold and silver axes, went.\r\n Each would have thought himself a fool\r\n Not to have own'd the richest tool.\r\n But Mercury promptly gave, instead\r\n Of it, a blow upon the head.\r\n With simple truth to be contented,\r\n Is surest not to be repented;\r\n But still there are who would\r\n With evil trap the good,--\r\n Whose cunning is but stupid,\r\n For Jove is never dupÃ¨d.\r\n\r\n[1] Aesop.

O shame!\r\n The noose of rope and death sublime,'\r\n For that offence, were all too tame!\r\n And soon poor Grizzle felt the same.\r\n\r\n Thus human courts acquit the strong,\r\n And doom the weak, as therefore wrong.\r\n\r\n[4] One of the most original as well as one of the most beautiful of the\r\n poet's fables, yet much of the groundwork of its story may be traced\r\n in the Fables of Bidpaii and other collections.

He was the eldest brother of the Duke de Boufflers.\r\n In another _Letter_, March 3, 1672, Madame de SÃ©vignÃ©\r\n says:--\"Here is Fontaine's fable too, on the adventure of M. de\r\n Boufflers' curate, who was killed in the coach by his dead patron.\r\n There was something very extraordinary in the affair itself: the\r\n fable is pretty; but not to be compared to the one that follows it:\r\n I do not understand the Milk-pot.\"\r\n[16] This allusion to the preceding fable must be the \"milk-pot\" which\r\n Madame de SÃ©vignÃ© did \"not understand\" (_vide_ last note);\r\n Madame can hardly have meant the \"milk-pot\" fable, which is easily\r\n understood. She often saw La Fontaine's work before it was\r\n published, and the date of her letter quoted at p. 161 shows that\r\n she must so have seen the \"Curate and the Corpse,\" and that,\r\n perhaps, without so seeing the \"Dairywoman and the Pot of Milk.\""

No. Whence, then, the notion,\r\n From mountain top to ocean?\r\n The roughness of that satellite,\r\n Its hills and dales, of every grade,\r\n Effect a change of light and shade\r\n Deceptive to our feeble sight;\r\n So that, besides the human face,\r\n All sorts of creatures one might trace.\r\n Indeed, a living beast, I ween,\r\n Has lately been by England seen.\r\n All duly placed the telescope,\r\n And keen observers full of hope,\r\n An animal entirely new,\r\n In that fair planet, came to view.\r\n Abroad and fast the wonder flew;--\r\n Some change had taken place on high,\r\n Presaging earthly changes nigh;\r\n Perhaps, indeed, it might betoken\r\n The wars[30] that had already broken\r\n Out wildly o'er the Continent.\r\n The king to see the wonder went:\r\n (As patron of the sciences,\r\n No right to go more plain than his.)\r\n To him, in turn, distinct and clear,\r\n This lunar monster did appear.--\r\n A mouse, between the lenses caged,\r\n Had caused these wars, so fiercely waged!\r\n No doubt the happy English folks\r\n Laugh'd at it as the best of jokes.\r\n How soon will Mars afford the chance\r\n For like amusements here in France!\r\n He makes us reap broad fields of glory.\r\n Our foes may fear the battle-ground;\r\n For us, it is no sooner found,\r\n Than Louis, with fresh laurels crown'd,\r\n Bears higher up our country's story.\r\n The daughters, too, of Memory,--\r\n The Pleasures and the Graces,--\r\n Still show their cheering faces:\r\n We wish for peace, but do not sigh.\r\n The English Charles the secret knows\r\n To make the most of his repose.\r\n And more than this, he'll know the way,\r\n By valour, working sword in hand,\r\n To bring his sea-encircled land\r\n To share the fight it only sees to-day.\r\n Yet, could he but this quarrel quell,\r\n What incense-clouds would grateful swell!\r\n What deed more worthy of his fame!\r\n Augustus, Julius[31]--pray, which Caesar's name\r\n Shines now on story's page with purest flame?\r\n O people happy in your sturdy hearts!\r\n Say, when shall Peace pack up these bloody darts,\r\n And send us all, like you, to softer arts?\r\n\r\n[26] This fable is founded on a fact which occurred in the experience of\r\n the astronomer Sir Paul Neal, a member of the Royal Society of\r\n London.--Translator. Sir Paul Neal, whose _lapsus_ suggested\r\n this fable, thought he had discovered an animal in the moon.\r\n Unluckily, however, after having made his \"discovery\" known, it was\r\n found that the ground of it was simply the accidental presence of a\r\n mouse in the object-glass of his telescope. Samuel Butler, the\r\n author of \"Hudibras,\" has also made fun of this otherwise rather\r\n tragical episode in the early history of the Royal Society of\r\n London, _vide_ his \"Elephant in the Moon.\"\r\n[27] _One philosopher._--Democritus, the so-called \"laughing (or\r\n scoffing) philosopher.\" He lived B.C. about 400 years. Fable XXVI.,\r\n Book VIII., is devoted to him and how he was treated by his\r\n contemporaries.\r\n[28] _Another._--Epicurus, founder of the Epicurean philosophy. He\r\n lived B. C. about 300 years.\r\n[29] _Water crooks a stick_.--An allusion to the bent appearance\r\n which a stick has in water, consequent upon the refraction of light.\r\n[30] _The wars_.--This fable appears to have been composed about the\r\n beginning of the year 1677. The European powers then found\r\n themselves exhausted by wars, and desirous of peace. England, the\r\n only neutral, became, of course, the arbiter of the negotiations\r\n which ensued at Nimeguen. All the belligerent parties invoked her\r\n mediation. Charles II., however, felt himself exceedingly\r\n embarrassed by his secret connections with Louis XIV., which made\r\n him desire to prescribe conditions favourable to that monarch;\r\n while, on the other hand, he feared the people of England, if,\r\n treacherous to her interests, he should fail to favour the nations\r\n allied and combined against France.--Translator. _Vide_ Hume:\r\n who also says that the English king \"had actually in secret sold his\r\n neutrality to France, and he received remittances of 1,000,000\r\n livres a year, which was afterwards increased to 2,000,000 livres; a\r\n considerable sum in the embarrassed state of his revenue.\" Hume's\r\n _Hist.

      "content": "Address to Madame de la SabliÃ¨re.[1]\r\n\r\n You, Iris, 'twere an easy task to praise;\r\n But you refuse the incense of my lays.\r\n In this you are unlike all other mortals,\r\n Who welcome all the praise that seeks their portals;\r\n Not one who is not soothed by sound so sweet.\r\n For me to blame this humour were not meet,\r\n By gods and mortals shared in common,\r\n And, in the main, by lovely woman.\r\n That drink, so vaunted by the rhyming trade,\r\n That cheers the god who deals the thunder-blow,\r\n And oft intoxicates the gods below,--\r\n The nectar, Iris, is of praises made.\r\n You taste it not. But, in its place,\r\n Wit, science, even trifles grace\r\n Your bill of fare; but, for that matter,\r\n The world will not believe the latter.\r\n Well, leave the world in unbelief.\r\n Still science, trifles, fancies light as air,\r\n I hold, should mingle in a bill of fare,\r\n Each giving each its due relief;\r\n As, where the gifts of Flora fall,\r\n On different flowers we see\r\n Alight the busy bee,\r\n Educing sweet from all.\r\n Thus much premised, don't think it strange,\r\n Or aught beyond my muse's range,\r\n If e'en my fables should infold,\r\n Among their nameless trumpery,\r\n The traits of a philosophy\r\n Far-famed as subtle, charming, bold.\r\n They call it new--the men of wit;\r\n Perhaps you have not heard of it?[2]\r\n My verse will tell you what it means:--\r\n They say that beasts are mere machines;[3]\r\n That, in their doings, everything\r\n Is done by virtue of a spring--\r\n No sense, no soul, nor notion;\r\n But matter merely,--set in motion,\r\n Just such the watch in kind,\r\n Which joggeth on, to purpose blind.\r\n Now ope, and read within its breast--\r\n The place of soul is by its wheels possess'd.\r\n One moves a second, that a third,\r\n Till finally its sound is heard.\r\n And now the beast, our sages say,\r\n Is moved precisely in this way\r\n An object strikes it in a certain place:\r\n The spot thus struck, without a moment's space,\r\n To neighbouring parts the news conveys;\r\n Thus sense receives it through the chain,\r\n And takes impression.--How? Explain.--\r\n Not I. They say, by sheer necessity,\r\n From will as well as passion free,\r\n The animal is found the thrall\r\n Of movements which the vulgar call\r\n Joy, sadness, pleasure, pain, and love--\r\n The cause extrinsic and above.--\r\n Believe it not. What's this I hold?\r\n Why, sooth, it is a watch of gold--\r\n Its life, the mere unbending of a spring.\r\n And we?--are quite a different thing.\r\n Hear how Descartes--Descartes, whom all applaud,\r\n Whom pagans would have made a god,\r\n Who holds, in fact, the middle place\r\n 'Twixt ours and the celestial race,\r\n About as does the plodding ass\r\n From man to oyster as you pass--\r\n Hear how this author states the case\r\n 'Of all the tribes to being brought\r\n By our Creator out of nought,\r\n I only have the gift of thought.'\r\n Now, Iris, you will recollect\r\n We were by older science taught\r\n That when brutes think, they don't reflect.\r\n Descartes proceeds beyond the wall,\r\n And says they do not think at all.\r\n This you believe with ease;\r\n And so could I, if I should please.\r\n Still, in the forest, when, from morn\r\n Till midday, sounds of dog and horn\r\n Have terrified the stag forlorn;\r\n When he has doubled forth and back,\r\n And labour'd to confound his track,\r\n Till tired and spent with efforts vain--\r\n An ancient stag, of antlers ten;--\r\n He puts a younger in his place,\r\n All fresh, to weary out the chase.--\r\n What thoughts for one that merely grazes!\r\n The doublings, turnings, windings, mazes,\r\n The substituting fresher bait,\r\n Were worthy of a man of state--\r\n And worthy of a better fate!\r\n To yield to rascal dogs his breath\r\n Is all the honour of his death.\r\n And when the partridge danger spies,\r\n Before her brood have strength to rise,\r\n She wisely counterfeits a wound,\r\n And drags her wing upon the ground--\r\n Thus, from her home, beside some ancient log,\r\n Safe drawing off the sportsman and his dog;\r\n And while the latter seems to seize her,\r\n The victim of an easy chase--\r\n 'Your teeth are not for such as me, sir,'\r\n She cries,\r\n And flies,\r\n And laughs the former in his face.\r\n\r\n Far north, 'tis said, the people live\r\n In customs nearly primitive;\r\n That is to say, are bound\r\n In ignorance profound:--\r\n I mean the people human;\r\n For animals are dwelling there\r\n With skill such buildings to prepare\r\n As could on earth but few men.\r\n Firm laid across the torrent's course,\r\n Their work withstands its mighty force,\r\n So damming it from shore to shore,\r\n That, gliding smoothly o'er,\r\n In even sheets the waters pour.\r\n Their work, as it proceeds, they grade and bevel,\r\n Or bring it up to plumb or level;\r\n First lay their logs, and then with mortar smear,\r\n As if directed by an engineer.\r\n Each labours for the public good;\r\n The old command, the youthful brood\r\n Cut down, and shape, and place the wood.\r\n Compared with theirs, e'en Plato's model state\r\n Were but the work of some apprentice pate.\r\n Such are the beaver folks, who know\r\n Enough to house themselves from snow,\r\n And bridge, though they can swim, the pools.\r\n Meanwhile, our kinsmen are such fools,\r\n In spite of their example,\r\n They dwell in huts less ample,\r\n And cross the streams by swimming,\r\n However cold and brimming!\r\n Now that the skilful beaver,\r\n Is but a body void of spirit,\r\n From whomsoever I might hear it,\r\n I would believe it never.\r\n\r\n But I go farther in the case.\r\n Pray listen while I tell\r\n A thing which lately fell\r\n From one of truly royal race.[4]\r\n A prince beloved by Victory,\r\n The North's defender here shall be\r\n My voucher and your guaranty;\r\n Whose mighty name alone\r\n Commands the sultan's throne,\r\n The king whom Poland calls her own.\r\n This king declares (kings cannot lie, we hear)\r\n That, on his own frontier,\r\n Some animals there are;\r\n Engaged in ceaseless war;\r\n From age to age the quarrel runs,\r\n Transmitted down from sires to sons;\r\n (These beasts, he says, are to the fox akin;)\r\n And with more skill no war hath been,\r\n By highest military powers,\r\n Conducted in this age of ours\r\n Guards, piquets, scouts, and spies,\r\n And ambuscade that hidden lies,\r\n The foe to capture by surprise,\r\n And many a shrewd appliance\r\n Of that pernicious, cursed science,\r\n The daughter of the Stygian wave,\r\n And mother harsh of heroes brave,\r\n Those military creatures have.\r\n To chant their feats a bard we lack,\r\n Till Death shall give us Homer back.\r\n And should he such a wonder do,\r\n And, while his hand was in, release\r\n Old Epicurus' rival[5] too,\r\n What would the latter say to facts like these?\r\n Why, as I've said, that nature does such things\r\n In animals by means of springs;\r\n That Memory is but corporeal;\r\n And that to do the things array'd\r\n So proudly in my story all,\r\n The animal but needs her aid.\r\n At each return, the object, so to speak,\r\n Proceeds directly to her store\r\n With keenest optics--there to seek\r\n The image it had traced before,\r\n Which found, proceeds forthwith to act\r\n Just as at first it did, in fact,\r\n By neither thought nor reason back'd.\r\n Not so with us, beasts perpendicular;\r\n With us kind Heaven is more particular.\r\n Self-ruled by independent mind,\r\n We're not the sport of objects blind,\r\n Nor e'en to instinct are consign'd.\r\n I walk; I talk; I feel the sway\r\n Of power within\r\n This nice machine,\r\n It cannot but obey.\r\n This power, although with matter link'd,\r\n Is comprehended as distinct.\r\n Indeed 'tis comprehended better\r\n In truth and essence than is matter.\r\n O'er all our arts it is supreme.\r\n But how doth matter understand\r\n Or hear its sovereign lord's command?\r\n Here doth a difficulty seem:\r\n I see the tool obey the hand;\r\n But then the hand who guideth it;\r\n Who guides the stars in order fit?\r\n Perhaps each mighty world,\r\n Since from its Maker hurl'd,\r\n Some angel may have kept in custody.\r\n However that may be,\r\n A spirit dwells in such as we;\r\n It moves our limbs; we feel its mandates now;\r\n We see and know it rules, but know not how:\r\n Nor shall we know, indeed,\r\n Till in the breast of God we read.\r\n And, speaking in all verity,\r\n Descartes is just as ignorant as we;\r\n In things beyond a mortal's ken,\r\n He knows no more than other men.\r\n But, Iris, I confess to this,\r\n That in the beasts of which I speak\r\n Such spirit it were vain to seek,\r\n For man its only temple is.\r\n Yet beasts must have a place\r\n Beneath our godlike race,\r\n Which no mere plant requires\r\n Although the plant respires.\r\n\r\n But what shall one reply\r\n To what I next shall certify?\r\n Two rats in foraging fell on an egg,--\r\n For gentry such as they\r\n A genteel dinner every way;\r\n They needed not to find an ox's leg.\r\n Brimful of joy and appetite,\r\n They were about to sack the box,\r\n So tight without the aid of locks,\r\n When suddenly there came in sight\r\n A personage--Sir Pullet Fox.\r\n Sure, luck was never more untoward\r\n Since Fortune was a vixen froward!\r\n How should they save their egg--and bacon?\r\n Their plunder couldn't then be bagg'd;\r\n Should it in forward paws be taken,\r\n Or roll'd along, or dragg'd?\r\n Each method seem'd impossible,\r\n And each was then of danger full.\r\n Necessity, ingenious mother,\r\n Brought forth what help'd them from their pother.\r\n As still there was a chance to save their prey,--\r\n The spunger yet some hundred yards away,--\r\n One seized the egg, and turn'd upon his back,\r\n And then, in spite of many a thump and thwack,\r\n That would have torn, perhaps, a coat of mail,\r\n The other dragg'd him by the tail.\r\n Who dares the inference to blink,\r\n That beasts possess wherewith to think?\r\n\r\n Were I commission'd to bestow\r\n This power on creatures here below,\r\n The beasts should have as much of mind\r\n As infants of the human kind.\r\n Think not the latter, from their birth?\r\n It hence appears there are on earth\r\n That have the simple power of thought\r\n Where reason hath no knowledge wrought.\r\n And on this wise an equal power I'd yield\r\n To all the various tenants of the field;\r\n Not reason such as in ourselves we find,\r\n But something more than any mainspring blind.\r\n A speck of matter I would subtilise\r\n Almost beyond the reach of mental eyes;--\r\n An atom's essence, one might say,\r\n An extract of a solar ray,\r\n More quick and pungent than a flame of fire,--\r\n For if of flame the wood is sire,\r\n Cannot the flame, itself refined,\r\n Give some idea of the mind?\r\n Comes not the purest gold\r\n From lead, as we are told?\r\n To feel and choose, my work should soar--\r\n Unthinking judgment--nothing more.\r\n No monkey of my manufacture\r\n Should argue from his sense or fact, sure:\r\n But my allotment to mankind\r\n Should be of very different mind.\r\n We men should share in double measure,\r\n Or rather have a twofold treasure;\r\n The one the soul, the same in all\r\n That bear the name of animal--\r\n The sages, dunces, great and small,\r\n That tenant this our teeming ball;--\r\n The other still another soul,\r\n Which should to mortals here belong\r\n In common with the angel throng;\r\n Which, made an independent whole,\r\n Could pierce the skies to worlds of light,\r\n Within a point have room to be,--\r\n Its life a morn, sans noon or night.\r\n Exempt from all destructive change--\r\n A thing as real as it is strange.\r\n In infancy this child of day\r\n Should glimmer but a feeble ray.\r\n Its earthly organs stronger grown,\r\n The beam of reason, brightly thrown,\r\n Should pierce the darkness, thick and gross,\r\n That holds the other prison'd close.\r\n\r\n[1] _Madame de la SabliÃ¨re_.--See the following note; also the\r\n Translator's Preface.\r\n[2] _Perhaps you have not heard of it_?--Madame de la SabliÃ¨re was\r\n one of the most learned women of the age in which she lived, and knew\r\n more of the philosophy of Descartes, in which she was a believer,\r\n than our poet; but she dreaded the reputation of a \"blue-stocking,\"\r\n and for this reason La Fontaine addresses her as if she might be\r\n ignorant of the Cartesian theory.--Translator. MoliÃ¨re's _Femme\r\n Savante_, the object of which was to ridicule the French\r\n \"blue-stockings,\" had been only recently produced upon the stage\r\n (1672), hence Madame de la SabliÃ¨re's fears, and La Fontaine's\r\n delicate forbearance.\r\n[3] _Beasts are mere machines_.--At this time the discussion as to\r\n the mind in animals was very rife in the salons of Paris. Madame de\r\n SÃ©vignÃ© often alludes to it in her Letters. La Fontaine further\r\n contends against the \"mere machine\" theory in Fable IX., Book XI.\r\n[4] _One of truly royal race_.--John Sobieski.--Translator. At the\r\n time this was written, Sobieski's great victory over the Turks at\r\n Choczim (1673) was resounding throughout Europe, and had made him\r\n King of Poland (1674). Sobieski had previously been a frequent\r\n visitor at the house of Madame de la SabliÃ¨re, where La Fontaine had\r\n often met him. Sobieski is again alluded to as a guest of Madame de\r\n la SabliÃ¨re, in Fable XV., Book XII.\r\n[5] _Old Epicurus' rival_.--Descartes.--Translator."

'Let's trust,' replied\r\n The crawling beast, well gratified.\r\n So said, so done;\r\n The ox, with tardy pace, came on\r\n And, ruminating o'er the case,\r\n Declared, with very serious face,\r\n That years of his most painful toil\r\n Had clothed with Ceres' gifts our soil--\r\n Her gifts to men--but always sold\r\n To beasts for higher cost than gold;\r\n And that for this, for his reward,\r\n More blows than thanks return'd his lord;\r\n And then, when age had chill'd his blood,\r\n And men would quell the wrath of Heaven,\r\n Out must be pour'd the vital flood,\r\n For others' sins, all thankless given.\r\n So spake the ox; and then the man:--\r\n 'Away with such a dull declaimer!\r\n Instead of judge, it is his plan\r\n To play accuser and defamer.'\r\n A tree was next the arbitrator,\r\n And made the wrong of man still greater.\r\n It served as refuge from the heat,\r\n The showers, and storms which madly beat;\r\n It grew our gardens' greatest pride,\r\n Its shadow spreading far and wide,\r\n And bow'd itself with fruit beside:\r\n But yet a mercenary clown\r\n With cruel iron chopp'd it down.\r\n Behold the recompense for which,\r\n Year after year, it did enrich,\r\n With spring's sweet flowers, and autumn's fruits,\r\n And summer's shade, both men and brutes,\r\n And warm'd the hearth with many a limb\r\n Which winter from its top did trim!\r\n Why could not man have pruned and spared,\r\n And with itself for ages shared?--\r\n Much scorning thus to be convinced,\r\n The man resolved his cause to gain.\r\n Quoth he, 'My goodness is evinced\r\n By hearing this, 'tis very plain;'\r\n Then flung the serpent bag and all,\r\n With fatal force, against a wall.\r\n\r\n So ever is it with the great,\r\n With whom the whim doth always run,\r\n That Heaven all creatures doth create\r\n For their behoof beneath the sun--\r\n Count they four feet, or two, or none.\r\n If one should dare the fact dispute,\r\n He's straight set down a stupid brute.\r\n Now, grant it so,--such lords among,\r\n What should be done, or said, or sung?\r\n At distance speak, or hold your tongue.\r\n\r\n[6] Bidpaii."

What worse than death, prophetic hermit?'\r\n 'Perhaps, the compound heartache I may term it.'\r\n And never was there truer prophecy.\r\n Full many a courtier pest, by many a lie\r\n Contrived, and many a cruel slander,\r\n To make the king suspect the judge awry\r\n In both ability and candour.\r\n Cabals were raised, and dark conspiracies,\r\n Of men that felt aggrieved by his decrees.\r\n 'With wealth of ours he hath a palace built,'\r\n Said they. The king, astonish'd at his guilt,\r\n His ill-got riches ask'd to see.\r\n He found but mediocrity,\r\n Bespeaking strictest honesty.\r\n So much for his magnificence.\r\n Anon, his plunder was a hoard immense\r\n Of precious stones that fill'd an iron box\r\n All fast secur'd by half a score of locks.\r\n Himself the coffer oped, and sad surprise\r\n Befell those manufacturers of lies.\r\n The open'd lid disclosed no other matters\r\n Than, first, a shepherd's suit in tatters,\r\n And then a cap and jacket, pipe and crook,\r\n And scrip, mayhap with pebbles from the brook.\r\n 'O treasure sweet,' said he, 'that never drew\r\n The viper brood of envy's lies on you!\r\n I take you back, and leave this palace splendid,\r\n As some roused sleeper doth a dream that's ended.\r\n Forgive me, sire, this exclamation.\r\n In mounting up, my fall I had foreseen,\r\n Yet loved the height too well; for who hath been,\r\n Of mortal race, devoid of all ambition?'\r\n\r\n[17] Bidpaii (_The Hermit_).

And such a man as this is\r\n Was delegate from towns the Danube kisses,\r\n When not a nook on earth there linger'd\r\n By Roman avarice not finger'd.\r\n Before the senate thus he spoke:--\r\n 'Romans and senators who hear,\r\n I, first of all, the gods invoke,\r\n The powers whom mortals justly fear,\r\n That from my tongue there may not fall\r\n A word which I may need recall.\r\n Without their aid there enters nought\r\n To human hearts of good or just:\r\n Whoever leaves the same unsought,\r\n Is prone to violate his trust;\r\n The prey of Roman avarice,\r\n Ourselves are witnesses of this.\r\n Rome, by our crimes, our scourge has grown,\r\n More than by valour of her own.\r\n Romans, beware lest Heaven, some day,\r\n Exact for all our groans the pay,\r\n And, arming us, by just reverse,\r\n To do its vengeance, stern, but meet,\r\n Shall pour on you the vassal's curse,\r\n And place your necks beneath our feet!\r\n And wherefore not? For are you better\r\n Than hundreds of the tribes diverse\r\n Who clank the galling Roman fetter?\r\n What right gives you the universe?\r\n Why come and mar our quiet life?\r\n We till'd our acres free from strife;\r\n In arts our hands were skill'd to toil,\r\n As well as o'er the generous soil.\r\n What have you taught the Germans brave?\r\n Apt scholars, had but they\r\n Your appetite for sway,\r\n They might, instead of you, enslave,\r\n Without your inhumanity.\r\n That which your praetors perpetrate\r\n On us, as subjects of your state,\r\n My powers would fail me to relate.\r\n Profaned their altars and their rites,\r\n The pity of your gods our lot excites.\r\n Thanks to your representatives,\r\n In you they see but shameless thieves,\r\n Who plunder gods as well as men.\r\n By sateless avarice insane,\r\n The men that rule our land from this\r\n Are like the bottomless abyss.\r\n To satisfy their lust of gain,\r\n Both man and nature toil in vain.\r\n Recall them; for indeed we will\r\n Our fields for such no longer till.\r\n From all our towns and plains we fly\r\n For refuge to our mountains high.\r\n We quit our homes and tender wives,\r\n To lead with savage beasts our lives--\r\n No more to welcome into day\r\n A progeny for Rome a prey.\r\n And as to those already born--\r\n Poor helpless babes forlorn!--\r\n We wish them short career in time:\r\n Your praetors force us to the crime.\r\n Are they our teachers? Call them home,--\r\n They teach but luxury and vice,--\r\n Lest Germans should their likes become,\r\n In fell remorseless avarice.\r\n Have we a remedy at Rome?\r\n I'll tell you here how matters go.\r\n Hath one no present to bestow,\r\n No purple for a judge or so,\r\n The laws for him are deaf and dumb;\r\n Their minister has aye in store\r\n A thousand hindrances or more.\r\n I'm sensible that truths like these\r\n Are not the things to please.\r\n I've done. Let death avenge you here\r\n Of my complaint, a little too sincere.'\r\n\r\n He said no more; but all admired\r\n The thought with which his speech was fired;\r\n The eloquence and heart of oak\r\n With which the prostrate savage spoke.\r\n Indeed, so much were all delighted,\r\n As due revenge, the man was knighted.\r\n The praetors were at once displaced,\r\n And better men the office graced.\r\n The senate, also, by decree,\r\n Besought a copy of the speech,\r\n Which might to future speakers be\r\n A model for the use of each.\r\n Not long, howe'er, had Rome the sense\r\n To entertain such eloquence.\r\n\r\n[11] La Fontaine got the historical story embodied in this fable from\r\n Marcus Aurelius (as he acknowledges), probably through FranÃ§ois\r\n Cassandre's \"ParallÃ¨les Historiques,\" 1676, and the translation\r\n (from the Spanish of Guevara) titled the \"Horloge des Princes,\"\r\n which Grise and De Heberay published at Lyons in 1575.\r\n[12] Aesop and Socrates are usually represented as very ugly."

Was that a sin?--\r\n By Pilpay this remarkable affair\r\n Is placed beside the Ganges' flood.\r\n No human creature ventures, there,\r\n To shed of animals the blood:\r\n The deed not even royalty would dare.\r\n 'Know we,' they say,--both lord and liege,--\r\n 'This bird saw not the Trojan siege?\r\n Perhaps a hero's part he bore,\r\n And there the highest helmet wore.\r\n What once he was, he yet may be.\r\n Taught by Pythagoras are we,\r\n That we our forms with animals exchange;\r\n We're kites or pigeons for a while,\r\n Then biped plodders on the soil;\r\n And then\r\n As volatile, again\r\n The liquid air we range.--'\r\n Now since two versions of this tale exist,\r\n I'll give the other if you list.\r\n A certain falconer had caught\r\n A kite, and for his sovereign thought\r\n The bird a present rich and rare.\r\n It may be once a century\r\n Such game is taken from the air;\r\n For 'tis the pink of falconry.\r\n The captor pierced the courtier crowd,\r\n With zeal and sweat, as if for life;\r\n Of such a princely present proud,\r\n His hopes of fortune sprang full rife;\r\n When, slap, the savage made him feel\r\n His talons, newly arm'd with steel,\r\n By perching on his nasal member,\r\n As if it had been senseless timber.\r\n Outshriek'd the wight; but peals of laughter,\r\n Which threaten'd ceiling, roof, and rafter,\r\n From courtier, page, and monarch broke:\r\n Who had not laugh'd at such a joke?\r\n From me, so prone am I to such a sin,\r\n An empire had not held me in.\r\n I dare not say, that, had the pope been there,\r\n He would have join'd the laugh sonorous;\r\n But sad the king, I hold, who should not dare\r\n To lead, for such a cause, in such a chorus.\r\n The gods are laughers. Spite of ebon brows,\r\n Jove joints the laugh which he allows.\r\n As history saith, the thunderer's laugh went up\r\n When limping Vulcan served the nectar cup.\r\n Whether or not immortals here are wise,\r\n Good sense, I think, in my digression lies.\r\n For, since the moral's what we have in view,\r\n What could the falconer's fate have taught us new?\r\n Who does not notice, in the course of things,\r\n More foolish falconers than indulgent kings?\r\n\r\n[21] Bidpaii.\r\n[22] _Prince de Conti_.--This was Francis-Louis, Prince de la\r\n Roche-sur-Yon and de Conti, another of La Fontaine's great friends\r\n at court.

but how imperfectly!\r\n For could a heart that throbb'd to bless\r\n Its friends with boundless tenderness,--\r\n Or could that heaven-descended mind\r\n Which, in its matchless beauty, join'd\r\n The strength of man with woman's grace,--\r\n Be given to sculptor to express?\r\n O Iris, who canst charm the soul--\r\n Nay, bind it with supreme control,--\r\n Whom as myself I can but love,--\r\n (Nay, not that word: as I'm a man,\r\n Your court has placed it under ban,\r\n And we'll dismiss it,) pray approve\r\n My filling up this hasty plan!\r\n This sketch has here received a place,\r\n A simple anecdote to grace,\r\n Where friendship shows so sweet a face,\r\n That in its features you may find\r\n Somewhat accordant to your mind.\r\n Not that the tale may kings beseem;\r\n But he who winneth your esteem\r\n Is not a monarch placed above\r\n The need and influence of love,\r\n But simple mortal, void of crown,\r\n That would for friends his life lay down--\r\n Than which I know no friendlier act.\r\n Four animals, in league compact,\r\n Are now to give our noble race\r\n A useful lesson in the case.\r\n\r\n Rat, raven, tortoise, and gazelle,\r\n Once into firmest friendship fell.\r\n 'Twas in a home unknown to man\r\n That they their happiness began.\r\n But safe from man there's no retreat:\r\n Pierce you the loneliest wood,\r\n Or dive beneath the deepest flood,\r\n Or mount you where the eagles brood,--\r\n His secret ambuscade you meet.\r\n The light gazelle, in harmless play,\r\n Amused herself abroad one day,\r\n When, by mischance, her track was found\r\n And follow'd by the baying hound--\r\n That barbarous tool of barbarous man--\r\n From which far, far away she ran.\r\n At meal-time to the others\r\n The rat observed,--'My brothers,\r\n How happens it that we\r\n Are met to-day but three?\r\n Is Miss Gazelle so little steady?\r\n Hath she forgotten us already?'\r\n Out cried the tortoise at the word,--\r\n 'Were I, as Raven is, a bird,\r\n I'd fly this instant from my seat,\r\n And learn what accident, and where,\r\n Hath kept away our sister fair,--\r\n Our sister of the flying feet;\r\n For of her heart, dear rat,\r\n It were a shame to doubt of that.'\r\n The raven flew;\r\n He spied afar,--the face he knew,--\r\n The poor gazelle entangled in a snare,\r\n In anguish vainly floundering there.\r\n Straight back he turn'd, and gave the alarm;\r\n For to have ask'd the sufferer now,\r\n The why and wherefore, when and how,\r\n She had incurr'd so great a harm,--\r\n And lose in vain debate\r\n The turning-point of fate,\r\n As would the master of a school,--\r\n He was by no means such a fool.[30]\r\n On tidings of so sad a pith,\r\n The three their council held forthwith.\r\n By two it was the vote\r\n To hasten to the spot\r\n Where lay the poor gazelle.\r\n 'Our friend here in his shell,\r\n I think, will do as well\r\n To guard the house,' the raven said;\r\n 'For, with his creeping pace,\r\n When would he reach the place?\r\n Not till the deer were dead.'\r\n Eschewing more debate,\r\n They flew to aid their mate,\r\n That luckless mountain roe.\r\n The tortoise, too, resolved to go.\r\n Behold him plodding on behind,\r\n And plainly cursing in his mind,\r\n The fate that left his legs to lack,\r\n And glued his dwelling to his back.\r\n The snare was cut by Rongemail,\r\n (For so the rat they rightly hail).\r\n Conceive their joy yourself you may.\r\n Just then the hunter came that way,\r\n And, 'Who hath filch'd my prey?'\r\n Cried he, upon the spot\r\n Where now his prey was not.--\r\n A hole hid Rongemail;\r\n A tree the bird as well;\r\n The woods, the free gazelle.\r\n The hunter, well nigh mad,\r\n To find no inkling could be had,\r\n Espied the tortoise in his path,\r\n And straightway check'd his wrath.\r\n 'Why let my courage flag,\r\n Because my snare has chanced to miss?\r\n I'll have a supper out of this.'\r\n He said, and put it in his bag.\r\n And it had paid the forfeit so,\r\n Had not the raven told the roe,\r\n Who from her covert came,\r\n Pretending to be lame.\r\n The man, right eager to pursue,\r\n Aside his wallet threw,\r\n Which Rongemail took care\r\n To serve as he had done the snare;\r\n Thus putting to an end\r\n The hunter's supper on his friend.\r\n 'Tis thus sage Pilpay's tale I follow.\r\n Were I the ward of golden-hair'd Apollo,\r\n It were, by favour of that god, easy--\r\n And surely for your sake--\r\n As long a tale to make\r\n As is the Iliad or Odyssey.\r\n Grey Rongemail the hero's part should play,\r\n Though each would be as needful in his way.\r\n He of the mansion portable awoke\r\n Sir Raven by the words he spoke,\r\n To act the spy, and then the swift express.\r\n The light gazelle alone had had th' address\r\n The hunter to engage, and furnish time\r\n For Rongemail to do his deed sublime.\r\n Thus each his part perform'd. Which wins the prize?\r\n The heart, so far as in my judgment lies.[31]\r\n\r\n[27] Bidpaii.\r\n[28] _Madame de la SabliÃ¨re_.--See note to Fable I., Book X.: also\r\n Translator's Preface.\r\n[29] _Some mortals kneeling at her feet_.--In allusion to the\r\n distinguished company which assembled at the house of Madame de la\r\n SabliÃ¨re.

Stop, passenger,\r\n And say thou, with a falling tear,\r\n This youth here fell, unable to endure\r\n The ban of proud Alcimadure.\"'\r\n\r\n He would have added, but his heart\r\n Now felt the last, the fatal dart.\r\n Forth march'd the maid, in triumph deck'd,\r\n And of his murder little reck'd.\r\n In vain her steps her own attendants check'd,\r\n And plead\r\n That she, at least, should shed,\r\n Upon her lover dead,\r\n Some tears of due respect.\r\n The rosy god, of Cytherea born,\r\n She ever treated with the deepest scorn:\r\n Contemning him, his laws, and means of damage,\r\n She drew her train to dance around his image,\r\n When, woful to relate,\r\n The statue fell, and crush'd her with its weight!\r\n A voice forth issued from a cloud,--\r\n And echo bore the words aloud\r\n Throughout the air wide spread,--\r\n \"Let all now love--the insensible is dead.\"\r\n Meanwhile, down to the Stygian tide\r\n The shade of Daphnis hied,\r\n And quaked and wonder'd there to meet\r\n The maid, a ghostess, at his feet.\r\n All Erebus awaken'd wide,\r\n To hear that beauteous homicide\r\n Beg pardon of the swain who died--\r\n For being deaf to love confess'd,\r\n As was Ulysses to the prayer\r\n Of Ajax, begging him to spare,\r\n Or as was Dido's faithless guest.[44]\r\n\r\n[42] Theocritus, Idyl xxiii.\r\n[43] _Madame de la MÃ©sangÃ¨re._--This lady was the daughter of Madame\r\n de la SabliÃ¨re.--Translator. She was the lady termed La Marquise\r\n with whom Fontenelle sustained his imaginary \"conversation\" in the\r\n \"Plurality of Worlds,\" a book which became very popular both in\r\n France and England.\r\n[44] _Dido's faithless guest_.--Aeneas, with whom Dido, according to\r\n Virgil and Ovid, was in love, but who loved not, and sailed away."

      "content": "Three saints, for their salvation jealous,\r\n Pursued, with hearts alike most zealous,\r\n By routes diverse, their common aim.\r\n All highways lead to Rome: the same\r\n Of heaven our rivals deeming true,\r\n Each chose alone his pathway to pursue.\r\n Moved by the cares, delays, and crosses\r\n Attach'd to suits by legal process,\r\n One gave himself as judge, without reward,\r\n For earthly fortune having small regard.\r\n Since there are laws, to legal strife\r\n Man damns himself for half his life.\r\n For half?--Three-fourths!--perhaps the whole!\r\n The hope possess'd our umpire's soul,\r\n That on his plan he should be able\r\n To cure this vice detestable.--\r\n The second chose the hospitals.\r\n I give him praise: to solace pain\r\n Is charity not spent in vain,\r\n While men in part are animals.\r\n The sick--for things went then as now they go--\r\n Gave trouble to the almoner, I trow.\r\n Impatient, sour, complaining ever,\r\n As rack'd by rheum, or parch'd with fever,--\r\n 'His favourites are such and such;\r\n With them he watches over-much,\r\n And lets us die,' they say,--\r\n Such sore complaints from day to day\r\n Were nought to those that did await\r\n The reconciler of debate.\r\n His judgments suited neither side;\r\n Forsooth, in either party's view,\r\n He never held the balance true,\r\n But swerved in every cause he tried.\r\n\r\n Discouraged by such speech, the arbiter\r\n Betook himself to see the almoner.\r\n As both received but murmurs for their fees,\r\n They both retired, in not the best of moods,\r\n To break their troubles to the silent woods,\r\n And hold communion with the ancient trees.\r\n There, underneath a rugged mountain,\r\n Beside a clear and silent fountain,\r\n A place revered by winds, to sun unknown,\r\n They found the other saint, who lived alone.\r\n Forthwith they ask'd his sage advice.\r\n 'Your own,' he answer'd, 'must suffice;\r\n Who but yourselves your wants should know?\r\n To know one's self, is, here below,\r\n The first command of the Supreme.\r\n Have you obey'd among the bustling throngs?\r\n Such knowledge to tranquillity belongs;\r\n Elsewhere to seek were fallacy extreme.\r\n Disturb the water--do you see your face?\r\n See we ourselves within a troubled breast?\r\n A murky cloud in such a case,\r\n Though once it were a crystal vase!\r\n But, brothers, let it simply rest,\r\n And each shall see his features there impress'd.\r\n For inward thought a desert home is best.'\r\n\r\n Such was the hermit's answer brief;\r\n And, happily, it gain'd belief.\r\n\r\n But business, still, from life must not be stricken\r\n Since men will doubtless sue at law, and sicken,\r\n Physicians there must be, and advocates,--\r\n Whereof, thank God, no lack the world awaits,\r\n While wealth and honours are the well-known baits.\r\n Yet, in the stream of common wants when thrown,\r\n What busy mortal but forgets his own?\r\n O, you who give the public all your care,\r\n Be it as judge, or prince, or minister,\r\n Disturb'd by countless accidents most sinister,\r\n By adverse gales abased, debased by fair,--\r\n Yourself you never see, nor _see_ you aught.\r\n Comes there a moment's rest for serious thought,\r\n There comes a flatterer too, and brings it all to nought.\r\n This lesson seals our varied page:\r\n O, may it teach from age to age!\r\n To kings I give it, to the wise propose;\r\n Where could my labours better close?[45]\r\n\r\n[45] This fable was first printed in the \"Recueil de vers choisis du P.\r\n Bouhours,\" published in 1693, and afterwards given as the last of La\r\n Fontaine's Book XII.\r\n\n * * * * *\r\n\r\nFINIS.\r\n\r\n * * * * *\r\n\nINDEX TO THE FABLES.\r\n\nA.\r\n\r\nAbdera, People of, and Democritus.
