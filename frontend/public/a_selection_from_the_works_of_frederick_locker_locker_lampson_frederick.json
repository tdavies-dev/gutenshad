M. PRAED.\r\n\n Is human life a pleasant game\r\n That gives a palm to all?\r\n A fight for fortune, or for fame?\r\n A struggle, and a fall?\r\n Who views the Past, and all he prized,\r\n With tranquil exultation?\r\n And who can say, I've realised\r\n My fondest aspiration?\r\n\r\n Alas, not one! for rest assured\r\n That all are prone to quarrel\r\n With Fate, when worms destroy their gourd,\r\n Or mildew spoils their laurel:\r\n The prize may come to cheer our lot,\r\n But all too late--and granted\r\n 'Tis even better--still 'tis not\r\n Exactly what we wanted.\r\n\r\n My school-boy time! I wish to praise\r\n That bud of brief existence,\r\n The vision of my youthful days\r\n Now trembles in the distance.\r\n An envious vapour lingers here,\r\n And there I find a chasm;\r\n But much remains, distinct and clear,\r\n To sink enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n Such thoughts just now disturb my soul\r\n With reason good--for lately\r\n I took the train to Marley-knoll,\r\n And crossed the fields to Mately.\r\n I found old Wheeler at his gate,\r\n Who used rare sport to show me:\r\n My Mentor once on snares and bait--\r\n But Wheeler did not know me.\r\n\r\n \"Goodlord!\" at last exclaimed the churl,\r\n \"Are you the little chap, sir,\r\n What used to train his hair in curl,\r\n And wore a scarlet cap, sir?\"\r\n And then he fell to fill in blanks,\r\n And conjure up old faces;\r\n And talk of well-remembered pranks,\r\n In half forgotten places.\r\n\r\n It pleased the man to tell his brief\r\n And somewhat mournful story,\r\n Old Bliss's school had come to grief--\r\n And Bliss had \"gone to glory.\"\r\n His trees were felled, his house was razed--\r\n And what less keenly pained me,\r\n A venerable donkey grazed\r\n Exactly where he caned me.\r\n\r\n And where have all my playmates sped,\r\n Whose ranks were once so serried?\r\n Why some are wed, and some are dead,\r\n And some are only buried;\r\n Frank Petre, erst so full of fun,\r\n Is now St. Blaise's prior--\r\n And Travers, the attorney's son,\r\n Is member for the shire.\r\n\r\n Dame Fortune, that inconstant jade,\r\n Can smile when least expected,\r\n And those who languish in the shade,\r\n Need never be dejected.\r\n Poor Pat, who once did nothing right,\r\n Has proved a famous writer;\r\n While Mat \"shirked prayers\" (with all his might!)\r\n And wears, withal, his mitre.\r\n\r\n Dull maskers we! Life's festival\r\n Enchants the blithe new-comer;\r\n But seasons change, and where are all\r\n These friendships of our summer?\r\n Wan pilgrims flit athwart our track--\r\n Cold looks attend the meeting--\r\n We only greet them, glancing back,\r\n Or pass without a greeting!\r\n\r\n I owe old Bliss some rubs, but pride\r\n Constrains me to postpone 'em,\r\n He taught me something, 'ere he died,\r\n About _nil nisi bonum_.\r\n I've met with wiser, better men,\r\n But I forgive him wholly;\r\n Perhaps his jokes were sad--but then\r\n He used to storm so drolly.\r\n\r\n I still can laugh, is still my boast,\r\n But mirth has sounded gayer;\r\n And which provokes my laughter most--\r\n The preacher, or the player?\r\n Alack, I cannot laugh at what\r\n Once made us laugh so freely,\r\n For Nestroy and Grassot are not--\r\n And where is Mr. Keeley?\r\n\r\n O, shall I run away from hence,\r\n And dress and shave like Crusoe?\r\n Or join St. Blaise? No, Common Sense,\r\n Forbid that I should do so.\r\n I'd sooner dress your Little Miss\r\n As Paulet shaves his poodles!\r\n As soon propose for Betsy Bliss--\r\n Or get proposed for Boodle's.\r\n\r\n We prate of Life's illusive dyes,\r\n Yet still fond Hope enchants us;\r\n We all believe we near the prize,\r\n Till some fresh dupe supplants us!\r\n A bright reward, forsooth! And though\r\n No mortal has attained it,\r\n I still can hope, for well I know\r\n That Love has so ordained it.\r\n\r\n PARIS, _November, 1864_.\r\n\nBRAMBLE-RISE.\r\n\n What changes greet my wistful eyes\r\n In quiet little Bramble-Rise,\r\n Once smallest of its shire?\r\n How altered is each pleasant nook!\r\n The dumpy church used not to look\r\n So dumpy in the spire.\r\n\r\n This village is no longer mine;\r\n And though the Inn has changed its sign,\r\n The beer may not be stronger:\r\n The river, dwindled by degrees,\r\n Is now a brook,--the cottages\r\n Are cottages no longer.\r\n\r\n The thatch is slate, the plaster bricks,\r\n The trees have cut their ancient sticks,\r\n Or else the sticks are stunted:\r\n I'm sure these thistles once grew figs,\r\n These geese were swans, and once these pigs\r\n More musically grunted.\r\n\r\n Where early reapers whistled, shrill\r\n A whistle may be noted still,--\r\n The locomotive's ravings.\r\n New custom newer want begets,--\r\n My bank of early violets\r\n Is now a bank for savings!\r\n\r\n That voice I have not heard for long!\r\n So Patty still can sing the song\r\n A merry playmate taught her;\r\n I know the strain, but much suspect\r\n 'Tis not the child I recollect,\r\n But Patty,--Patty's daughter;\r\n\r\n And has she too outlived the spells\r\n Of breezy hills and silent dells\r\n Where childhood loved to ramble?\r\n Then Life was thornless to our ken,\r\n And, Bramble-Rise, thy hills were then\r\n A rise without a bramble.\r\n\r\n Whence comes the change? 'Twere easy told\r\n That some grow wise, and some grow cold,\r\n And all feel time and trouble:\r\n If Life an empty bubble be,\r\n How sad are those who will not see\r\n A rainbow in the bubble!\r\n\r\n And senseless too, for mistress Fate\r\n Is not the gloomy reprobate\r\n That mouldy sages thought her;\r\n My heart leaps up, and I rejoice\r\n As falls upon my ear thy voice,\r\n My frisky little daughter.\r\n\r\n Come hither, Pussy, perch on these\r\n Thy most unworthy father's knees,\r\n And tell him all about it:\r\n Are dolls but bran? Can men be base?\r\n When gazing on thy blessed face\r\n I'm quite prepared to doubt it.\r\n\r\n O, mayst thou own, my winsome elf,\r\n Some day a pet just like thyself,\r\n Her sanguine thoughts to borrow;\r\n Content to use her brighter eyes,--\r\n Accept her childish ecstacies,--\r\n If need be, share her sorrow!\r\n\r\n The wisdom of thy prattle cheers\r\n This heart; and when outworn in years\r\n And homeward I am starting,\r\n My Darling, lead me gently down\r\n To Life's dim strand: the dark waves frown,\r\n But weep not for our parting.\r\n\r\n Though Life is called a doleful jaunt,\r\n In sorrow rife, in sunshine scant,\r\n Though earthly joys, the wisest grant,\r\n Have no enduring basis;\r\n 'Tis something in a desert sere,\r\n For her so fresh--for me so drear,\r\n To find in Puss, my daughter dear,\r\n A little cool oasis!\r\n\r\n APRIL, 1857.\r\n\nTHE WIDOW'S MITE.\r\n\n The Widow had but only one,\r\n A puny and decrepit son;\r\n Yet, day and night,\r\n Though fretful oft, and weak, and small,\r\n A loving child, he was her all--\r\n The Widow's Mite.\r\n\r\n The Widow's might,--yes! so sustained,\r\n She battled onward, nor complained\r\n When friends were fewer:\r\n And, cheerful at her daily care,\r\n A little crutch upon the stair\r\n Was music to her.\r\n\r\n I saw her then,--and now I see,\r\n Though cheerful and resigned, still she\r\n Has sorrowed much:\r\n She has--HE gave it tenderly--\r\n Much faith--and, carefully laid by,\r\n A little crutch.\r\n\nON AN OLD MUFF\r\n\n Time has a magic wand!\r\n What is this meets my hand,\r\n Moth-eaten, mouldy, and\r\n Covered with fluff?\r\n Faded, and stiff, and scant;\r\n Can it be? no, it can't--\r\n Yes,--I declare 'tis Aunt\r\n Prudence's Muff!\r\n\r\n Years ago--twenty-three!\r\n Old Uncle Barnaby\r\n Gave it to Aunty P.--\r\n Laughing and teasing--\r\n \"Pru., of the breezy curls,\r\n Whisper these solemn churls,\r\n _What holds a pretty girl's\r\n Hand without squeezing?_\"\r\n\r\n Uncle was then a lad\r\n Gay, but, I grieve to add,\r\n Sinful: if smoking bad\r\n _Baccy's_ a vice:\r\n Glossy was then this mink\r\n Muff, lined with pretty pink\r\n Satin, which maidens think\r\n \"Awfully nice!\"\r\n\r\n I see, in retrospect,\r\n Aunt, in her best bedecked,\r\n Gliding, with mien erect,\r\n Gravely to Meeting:\r\n Psalm-book, and kerchief new,\r\n Peeped from the muff of Pru.--\r\n Young men--and pious too--\r\n Giving her greeting.\r\n\r\n Pure was the life she led\r\n Then--from this Muff, 'tis said,\r\n Tracts she distributed:--\r\n Scapegraces many,\r\n Seeing the grace they lacked,\r\n Followed her--one, in fact,\r\n Asked for--and got his tract\r\n Oftener than any.\r\n\r\n Love has a potent spell!\r\n Soon this bold Ne'er-do-well,\r\n Aunt's sweet susceptible\r\n Heart undermining,\r\n Slipped, so the scandal runs,\r\n Notes in the pretty nun's\r\n Muff--triple-cornered ones--\r\n Pink as its lining!\r\n\r\n Worse even, soon the jade\r\n Fled (to oblige her blade!)\r\n Whilst her friends thought that they'd\r\n Locked her up tightly:\r\n After such shocking games\r\n Aunt is of wedded dames\r\n Gayest--and now her name's\r\n Mrs. Golightly.\r\n\r\n In female conduct flaw\r\n Sadder I never saw,\r\n Still I've faith in the law\r\n Of compensation.\r\n Once Uncle went astray--\r\n Smoked, joked, and swore away--\r\n Sworn by, he's now, by a\r\n Large congregation!\r\n\r\n Changed is the Child of Sin,\r\n Now he's (he once was thin)\r\n Grave, with a double chin,--\r\n Blest be his fat form!\r\n Changed is the garb he wore,--\r\n Preacher was never more\r\n Prized than is Uncle for\r\n Pulpit or platform.\r\n\r\n If all's as best befits\r\n Mortals of slender wits,\r\n Then beg this Muff, and its\r\n Fair Owner pardon:\r\n _All's for the best_,--indeed\r\n Such is _my_ simple creed--\r\n Still I must go and weed\r\n Hard in my garden.\r\n\nA HUMAN SKULL.\r\n\n A human skull! I bought it passing cheap,--\r\n It might be dearer to its first employer;\r\n I thought mortality did well to keep\r\n Some mute memento of the Old Destroyer.\r\n\r\n Time was, some may have prized its blooming skin,\r\n Here lips were wooed perchance in transport tender;--\r\n Some may have chucked what was a dimpled chin,\r\n And never had my doubt about its gender!\r\n\r\n Did she live yesterday or ages back?\r\n What colour were the eyes when bright and waking?\r\n And were your ringlets fair, or brown, or black,\r\n Poor little head! that long has done with aching?\r\n\r\n It may have held (to shoot some random shots)\r\n Thy brains, Eliza Fry,--or Baron Byron's,\r\n The wits of Nelly Gwynn, or Doctor Watts,--\r\n Two quoted bards! two philanthropic sirens!\r\n\r\n But this I surely knew before I closed\r\n The bargain on the morning that I bought it;\r\n It was not half so bad as some supposed,\r\n Nor quite as good as many may have thought it.\r\n\r\n Who love, can need no special type of death;\r\n He bares his awful face too soon, too often;\r\n \"Immortelles\" bloom in Beauty's bridal wreath,\r\n And does not yon green elm contain a coffin?\r\n\r\n O, _cara_ mine, what lines of care are these?\r\n The heart still lingers with the golden hours,\r\n An Autumn tint is on the chestnut trees,\r\n And where is all that boasted wealth of flowers?\r\n\r\n If life no more can yield us what it gave,\r\n It still is linked with much that calls for praises;\r\n A very worthless rogue may dig the grave,\r\n But hands unseen will dress the turf with daisies.\r\n\nTO MY GRANDMOTHER.\r\n\r\n(SUGGESTED BY A PICTURE BY MR. ROMNEY.)\r\n\n This relative of mine\r\n Was she seventy and nine\r\n When she died?\r\n By the canvas may be seen\r\n How she looked at seventeen,--\r\n As a bride.\r\n\r\n Beneath a summer tree\r\n As she sits, her reverie\r\n Has a charm;\r\n Her ringlets are in taste,--\r\n What an arm! and what a waist\r\n For an arm!\r\n\r\n In bridal coronet,\r\n Lace, ribbons, and _coquette\r\n Falbala_;\r\n Were Romney's limning true,\r\n What a lucky dog were you,\r\n Grandpapa!\r\n\r\n Her lips are sweet as love,--\r\n They are parting! Do they move?\r\n Are they dumb?--\r\n Her eyes are blue, and beam\r\n Beseechingly, and seem\r\n To say, \"Come.\"\r\n\r\n What funny fancy slips\r\n From atween these cherry lips?\r\n Whisper me,\r\n Sweet deity, in paint,\r\n What canon says I mayn't\r\n Marry thee?\r\n\r\n That good-for-nothing Time\r\n Has a confidence sublime!\r\n When I first\r\n Saw this lady, in my youth,\r\n Her winters had, forsooth,\r\n Done their worst.\r\n\r\n Her locks (as white as snow)\r\n Once shamed the swarthy crow.\r\n By-and-by,\r\n That fowl's avenging sprite,\r\n Set his cloven foot for spite\r\n In her eye.\r\n\r\n Her rounded form was lean,\r\n And her silk was bombazine:--\r\n Well I wot,\r\n With her needles would she sit,\r\n And for hours would she knit,--\r\n Would she not?\r\n\r\n Ah, perishable clay!\r\n Her charms had dropt away\r\n One by one.\r\n But if she heaved a sigh\r\n With a burthen, it was, \"Thy\r\n Will be done.\"\r\n\r\n In travail, as in tears,\r\n With the fardel of her years\r\n Overprest,--\r\n In mercy was she borne\r\n Where the weary ones and worn\r\n Are at rest.\r\n\r\n I'm fain to meet you there,--\r\n If as witching as you were,\r\n Grandmamma!\r\n This nether world agrees\r\n That the better it must please\r\n Grandpapa.\r\n\nO TEMPORA MUTANTUR!\r\n\n Yes, here, once more, a traveller,\r\n I find the Angel Inn,\r\n Where landlord, maids, and serving-men\r\n Receive me with a grin:\r\n They surely can't remember _me_,\r\n My hair is grey and scanter;\r\n I'm changed, so changed since I was here--\r\n \"O tempora mutantur!\"\r\n\r\n The Angel's not much altered since\r\n That sunny month of June,\r\n Which brought me here with Pamela\r\n To spend our honeymoon!\r\n I recollect it down to e'en\r\n The shape of this decanter,--\r\n We've since been both much put about--\r\n \"O tempora mutantur!\"\r\n\r\n Ay, there's the clock, and looking-glass\r\n Reflecting me again;\r\n She vowed her Love was very fair--\r\n I see I'm very plain.\r\n And there's that daub of Prince Leeboo:\r\n 'Twas Pamela's fond banter\r\n To fancy it resembled me--\r\n \"O tempora mutantur!\"\r\n\r\n The curtains have been dyed; but there,\r\n Unbroken, is the same,\r\n The very same cracked pane of glass\r\n On which I scratched her name.\r\n Yes, there's her tiny flourish still,\r\n It used to so enchant her\r\n To link two happy names in one--\r\n \"O tempora mutantur!\"\r\n\r\n * * * * *\r\n\r\n What brought this wanderer here, and why\r\n Was Pamela away?\r\n It might be she had found her grave,\r\n Or he had found her gay.\r\n The fairest fade; the best of men\r\n May meet with a supplanter;--\r\n I wish the times would change their cry\r\n Of \"tempora mutantur.\"\r\n\nREPLY TO A LETTER ENCLOSING A LOCK OF HAIR.\r\n\n \"My darling wants to see you soon,\"--\r\n I bless the little maid, and thank her;\r\n To do her bidding, night and noon\r\n I draw on Hope--Love's kindest banker!\r\n\r\n _Old MSS._\r\n\r\n If you were false, and if I'm free,\r\n I still would be the slave of yore,\r\n Then joined our years were thirty-three,\r\n And now,--yes now, I'm thirty-four!\r\n And though you were not learned--well,\r\n I was not anxious you should grow so,--\r\n I trembled once beneath her spell\r\n Whose spelling was extremely so-so!\r\n\r\n Bright season! why will Memory\r\n Still haunt the path our rambles took;\r\n The sparrow's nest that made you cry,--\r\n The lilies captured in the brook.\r\n I lifted you from side to side,\r\n You seemed as light as that poor sparrow;\r\n I know who wished it twice as wide,\r\n I think you thought it rather narrow.\r\n\r\n Time was,--indeed, a little while!\r\n My pony did your heart compel;\r\n But once, beside the meadow-stile,\r\n I thought you loved me just as well;\r\n I kissed your cheek; in sweet surprise\r\n Your troubled gaze said plainly, \"Should he?\"\r\n But doubt soon fled those daisy eyes,--\r\n \"He could not wish to vex me, could he?\"\r\n\r\n As year succeeds to year, the more\r\n Imperfect life's fruition seems,\r\n Our dreams, as baseless as of yore,\r\n Are not the same enchanting dreams.\r\n The girls I love now vote me slow--\r\n How dull the boys who once seemed witty!\r\n Perhaps I'm getting old--I know\r\n I'm still romantic--more's the pity!\r\n\r\n Ah, vain regret! to few, perchance,\r\n Unknown--and profitless to all:\r\n The wisely-gay, as years advance,\r\n Are gaily-wise. Whate'er befall\r\n We'll laugh--at folly, whether seen\r\n Beneath a chimney or a steeple,\r\n At yours, at mine--our own, I mean,\r\n As well as that of other people.\r\n\r\n They cannot be complete in aught,\r\n Who are not humorously prone,\r\n A man without a merry thought\r\n Can hardly have a funny-bone!\r\n To say I hate your gloomy men\r\n Might be esteemed a strong assertion,\r\n If I've blue devils, now and then,\r\n I make them dance for my diversion.\r\n\r\n And here's your letter _debonnaire_!\r\n \"_My friend, my dear old friend of yore_,\"\r\n And is this curl your daughter's hair?\r\n I've seen the Titian tint before.\r\n Are we that pair who used to pass\r\n Long days beneath the chesnuts shady?\r\n You then were such a pretty lass!--\r\n I'm told you're now as fair a lady.\r\n\r\n I've laughed to hide the tear I shed,\r\n As when the Jester's bosom swells,\r\n And mournfully he shakes his head,\r\n We hear the jingle of his bells.\r\n A jesting vein your poet vexed,\r\n And this poor rhyme, the Fates determine,\r\n Without a parson, or a text,\r\n Has proved a somewhat prosy sermon.\r\n\nTHE OLD OAK-TREE AT HATFIELD BROADOAK.\r\n\n A mighty growth! The county side\r\n Lamented when the Giant died,\r\n For England loves her trees:\r\n What misty legends round him cling!\r\n How lavishly he once did fling\r\n His acorns to the breeze!\r\n\r\n To strike a thousand roots in fame,\r\n To give the district half its name,\r\n The fiat could not hinder;\r\n Last spring he put forth one green bough,--\r\n The red leaves hang there still,--but now\r\n His very props are tinder.\r\n\r\n Elate, the thunderbolt he braved,\r\n Long centuries his branches waved\r\n A welcome to the blast;\r\n An oak of broadest girth he grew,\r\n And woodman never dared to do\r\n What Time has done at last.\r\n\r\n The monarch wore a leafy crown,\r\n And wolves, ere wolves were hunted down,\r\n Found shelter at his foot;\r\n Unnumbered squirrels gambolled free,\r\n Glad music filled the gallant tree\r\n From stem to topmost shoot.\r\n\r\n And it were hard to fix the tale\r\n Of when he first peered forth a frail\r\n Petitioner for dew;\r\n No Saxon spade disturbed his root,\r\n The rabbit spared the tender shoot,\r\n And valiantly he grew,\r\n\r\n And showed some inches from the ground\r\n When Saint Augustine came and found\r\n Us very proper Vandals:\r\n When nymphs owned bluer eyes than hose,\r\n When England measured men by blows,\r\n And measured time by candles.\r\n\r\n Worn pilgrims blessed his grateful shade\r\n Ere Richard led the first crusade,\r\n And maidens led the dance\r\n Where, boy and man, in summer-time,\r\n Sweet Chaucer pondered o'er his rhyme;\r\n And Robin Hood, perchance,\r\n\r\n Stole hither to maid Marian,\r\n (And if they did not come, one can\r\n At any rate suppose it);\r\n They met beneath the mistletoe,--\r\n We did the same, and ought to know\r\n The reason why they chose it.\r\n\r\n And this was called the traitor's branch,--\r\n Stern Warwick hung six yeomen stanch\r\n Along its mighty fork;\r\n Uncivil wars for them! The fair\r\n Red rose and white still bloom,--but where\r\n Are Lancaster and York?\r\n\r\n Right mournfully his leaves he shed\r\n To shroud the graves of England's dead,\r\n By English falchion slain;\r\n And cheerfully, for England's sake,\r\n He sent his kin to sea with Drake,\r\n When Tudor humbled Spain.\r\n\r\n A time-worn tree, he could not bring\r\n His heart to screen the merry king,\r\n Or countenance his scandals;--\r\n Then men were measured by their wit,--\r\n And then the mimic statesmen lit\r\n At either end their candles!\r\n\r\n While Blake was busy with the Dutch\r\n They gave his poor old arms a crutch:\r\n And thrice four maids and men ate\r\n A meal within his rugged bark,\r\n When Coventry bewitched the park,\r\n And Chatham swayed the senate.\r\n\r\n His few remaining boughs were green,\r\n And dappled sunbeams danced between,\r\n Upon the dappled deer,\r\n When, clad in black, a pair were met\r\n To read the Waterloo Gazette,--\r\n They mourned their darling here.\r\n\r\n They joined their boy. The tree at last\r\n Lies prone--discoursing of the past,\r\n Some fancy-dreams awaking;\r\n Resigned, though headlong changes come,--\r\n Though nations arm to tuck of drum,\r\n And dynasties are quaking.\r\n\r\n Romantic spot! By honest pride\r\n Of eld tradition sanctified;\r\n My pensive vigil keeping,\r\n I feel thy beauty like a spell,\r\n And thoughts, and tender thoughts, upwell,\r\n That fill my heart to weeping.\r\n\r\n * * * * *\r\n\r\n The Squire affirms, with gravest look,\r\n His oak goes up to Domesday Book!--\r\n And some say even higher!\r\n We rode last week to see the ruin,\r\n We love the fair domain it grew in,\r\n And well we love the Squire.\r\n\r\n A nature loyally controlled,\r\n And fashioned in that righteous mould\r\n Of English gentleman;--\r\n My child may some day read these rhymes,--\r\n She loved her \"godpapa\" betimes,--\r\n The little Christian!\r\n\r\n I love the Past, its ripe pleasance,\r\n Its lusty thought, and dim romance,\r\n And heart-compelling ditties;\r\n But more, these ties, in mercy sent,\r\n With faith and true affection blent,\r\n And, wanting them, I were content\r\n To murmur, \"_Nunc dimittis_.\"\r\n\r\n HALLINGBURY, _April, 1859_.\r\n\nAN INVITATION TO ROME, AND THE REPLY.\r\n\nTHE INVITATION.\r\n\n O, come to Rome, it is a pleasant place,\r\n Your London sun is here seen shining brightly:\r\n The Briton too puts on a cheery face,\r\n And Mrs. Bull is _suave_ and even sprightly.\r\n The Romans are a kind and cordial race,\r\n The women charming, if one takes them rightly;\r\n I see them at their doors, as day is closing,\r\n More proud than duchesses--and more imposing.\r\n\r\n A \"_far niente_\" life promotes the graces;--\r\n They pass from dreamy bliss to wakeful glee,\r\n And in their bearing, and their speech, one traces\r\n A breadth of grace and depth of courtesy\r\n That are not found in more inclement places;\r\n Their clime and tongue seem much in harmony;\r\n The Cockney met in Middlesex, or Surrey,\r\n Is often cold--and always in a hurry.\r\n\r\n Though \"_far niente_\" is their passion, they\r\n Seem here most eloquent in things most slight;\r\n No matter what it is they have to say,\r\n The manner always sets the matter right.\r\n And when they've plagued or pleased you all the day\r\n They sweetly wish you \"a most happy night.\"\r\n Then, if they fib, and if their stories tease you,\r\n 'Tis always something that they've wished to please you.\r\n\r\n O, come to Rome, nor be content to read\r\n Alone of stately palaces and streets\r\n Whose fountains ever run with joyous speed,\r\n And never-ceasing murmur. Here one meets\r\n Great Memnon's monoliths--or, gay with weed,\r\n Rich capitals, as corner stones, or seats--\r\n The sites of vanished temples, where now moulder\r\n Old ruins, hiding ruin even older.\r\n\r\n Ay, come, and see the pictures, statues, churches,\r\n Although the last are commonplace, or florid.\r\n Some say 'tis here that superstition perches,--\r\n Myself I'm glad the marbles have been quarried.\r\n The sombre streets are worthy your researches:\r\n The ways are foul, the lava pavement's horrid,\r\n But pleasant sights, which squeamishness disparages,\r\n Are missed by all who roll about in carriages.\r\n\r\n About one fane I deprecate all sneering,\r\n For during Christmas-time I went there daily,\r\n Amused, or edified--or both--by hearing\r\n The little preachers of the _Ara Coeli_.\r\n Conceive a four-year-old _bambina_ rearing\r\n Her small form on a rostrum, tricked out gaily,\r\n And lisping, what for doctrine may be frightful,\r\n With action quite dramatic and delightful.\r\n\r\n O come! We'll charter such a pair of nags!\r\n The country's better seen when one is riding:\r\n We'll roam where yellow Tiber speeds or lags\r\n At will. The aqueducts are yet bestriding\r\n With giant march (now whole, now broken crags\r\n With flowers plumed) the swelling and subsiding\r\n Campagna, girt by purple hills, afar--\r\n That melt in light beneath the evening star.\r\n\r\n A drive to Palestrina will be pleasant--\r\n The wild fig grows where erst her turrets stood;\r\n There oft, in goat-skins clad, a sun-burnt peasant\r\n Like Pan comes frisking from his ilex wood,\r\n And seems to wake the past time in the present.\r\n Fair _contadina_, mark his mirthful mood,\r\n No antique satyr he. The nimble fellow\r\n Can join with jollity your _Salterello_.\r\n\r\n Old sylvan peace and liberty! The breath\r\n Of life to unsophisticated man.\r\n Here Mirth may pipe, here Love may weave his wreath,\r\n \"_Per dar' al mio bene_.\" When you can,\r\n Come share their leafy solitudes. Grim Death\r\n And Time are grudging of Life's little span:\r\n Wan Time speeds swiftly o'er the waving corn,\r\n Death grins from yonder cynical old thorn.\r\n\r\n I dare not speak of Michael Angelo--\r\n Such theme were all too splendid for my pen.\r\n And if I breathe the name of Sanzio\r\n (The brightest of Italian gentlemen),\r\n It is that love casts out my fear--and so\r\n I claim with him a kindredship. Ah! when\r\n We love, the name is on our hearts engraven,\r\n As is thy name, my own dear Bard of Avon!\r\n\r\n Nor is the Colosseum theme of mine,\r\n 'Twas built for poet of a larger daring;\r\n The world goes there with torches--I decline\r\n Thus to affront the moonbeams with their flaring.\r\n Some time in May our forces we'll combine\r\n (Just you and I) and try a midnight airing,\r\n And then I'll quote this rhyme to you--and then\r\n You'll muse upon the vanity of men.\r\n\r\n O come--I send a leaf of tender fern,\r\n 'Twas plucked where Beauty lingers round decay:\r\n The ashes buried in a sculptured urn\r\n Are not more dead than Rome--so dead to-day!\r\n That better time, for which the patriots yearn,\r\n Enchants the gaze, again to fade away.\r\n They wait and pine for what is long denied,\r\n And thus I wait till thou art by my side.\r\n\r\n Thou'rt far away! Yet, while I write, I still\r\n Seem gently, Sweet, to press thy hand in mine;\r\n I cannot bring myself to drop the quill,\r\n I cannot yet thy little hand resign!\r\n The plain is fading into darkness chill,\r\n The Sabine peaks are flushed with light divine,\r\n I watch alone, my fond thought wings to thee,\r\n O come to Rome--O come, O come to me!\r\n\nTHE REPLY.\r\n\n Dear Exile, I was pleased to get\r\n Your rhymes, I laid them up in cotton;\r\n You know that you are all to \"Pet,\"\r\n I feared that I was quite forgotten:\r\n Mama, who scolds me when I mope,\r\n Insists--and she is wise as gentle--\r\n That I am still in love--I hope\r\n That you are rather sentimental.\r\n\r\n Perhaps you think a child should not\r\n Be gay unless her slave is with her;\r\n Of course you love old Rome, and, what\r\n Is more, would like to coax me thither:\r\n What! quit this dear delightful maze\r\n Of calls and balls, to be intensely\r\n Discomfited in fifty ways--\r\n I like your confidence immensely!\r\n\r\n Some girls who love to ride and race,\r\n And live for dancing--like the Bruens,\r\n Confess that Rome's a charming place,\r\n In spite of all the stupid ruins:\r\n I think it might be sweet to pitch\r\n One's tent beside those banks of Tiber,\r\n And all that sort of thing--of which\r\n Dear Hawthorne's \"quite\" the best describer.\r\n\r\n To see stone pines, and marble gods,\r\n In garden alleys--red with roses--\r\n The Perch where Pio Nono nods;\r\n The Church where Raphael reposes.\r\n Make pleasant _giros_--when we may;\r\n Jump _stagionate_--where they're easy;\r\n And play croquet--the Bruens say\r\n There's turf behind the _Ludovisi_.\r\n\r\n I'll bring my books, though Mrs. Mee\r\n Says packing books is such a worry;\r\n I'll bring my \"Golden Treasury,\"\r\n Manzoni--and, of course, a \"Murray;\"\r\n A TUPPER, whom you men despise;\r\n A Dante--Auntie owns a quarto--\r\n I'll try and buy a smaller size,\r\n And read him on the _muro torto_.\r\n\r\n But can I go? _La Madre_ thinks\r\n It would be such an undertaking:--\r\n I wish we could consult a sphynx;--\r\n The thought alone has set her quaking.\r\n Papa--we do not mind Papa--\r\n Has got some \"notice\" of some \"motion,\"\r\n And could not stay; but, why not,--Ah,\r\n I've not the very slightest notion.\r\n\r\n The Browns have come to stay a week,\r\n They've brought the boys, I haven't thanked 'em,\r\n For Baby _Grand_, and Baby _Pic_,\r\n Are playing cricket in my sanctum:\r\n Your Rover too affects my den,\r\n And when I pat the dear old whelp, it ...\r\n It makes me think of you, and then ...\r\n And then I cry--I cannot help it.\r\n\r\n Ah, yes--before you left me, ere\r\n Our separation was impending,\r\n These eyes had seldom shed a tear--\r\n For mine was joy that knew no ending;\r\n Yes, soon there came a change, too soon:\r\n The first faint cloud that rose to grieve me\r\n Was knowledge I possessed the boon,\r\n And then a fear such bliss might leave me.\r\n\r\n This strain is sad: yet, understand,\r\n Your words have made my spirit better:\r\n And when I first took pen in hand,\r\n I meant to write a cheery letter;\r\n But skies were dull,--Rome sounded hot,\r\n I fancied I could live without it:\r\n I thought I'd go--I thought I'd not,\r\n And then I thought I'd think about it.\r\n\r\n The sun now glances o'er the Park,\r\n If tears are on my cheek, they glitter;\r\n I think I've kissed your rhymes, for--hark!\r\n My \"bulley\" gives a saucy twitter.\r\n Your blessed words extinguish doubt,\r\n A sudden breeze is gaily blowing,\r\n And, hark! The minster bells ring out--\r\n \"She ought to go! Of course she's going.\"\r\n\nOLD LETTERS.\r\n\n Old letters! wipe away the tear\r\n For vows and hopes so vainly worded?\r\n A pilgrim finds his journal here\r\n Since first his youthful loins were girded.\r\n\r\n Yes, here are wails from Clapham Grove,\r\n How could philosophy expect us\r\n To live with Dr. Wise, and love\r\n Rice pudding and the Greek Delectus?\r\n\r\n Explain why childhood's path is sown\r\n With moral and scholastic tin-tacks;\r\n Ere sin original was known,\r\n Did Adam groan beneath the syntax?\r\n\r\n How strange to parley with the dead!\r\n _Keep ye your green_, wan leaves? How many\r\n From Friendship's tree untimely shed!\r\n And here is one as sad as any;\r\n\r\n A ghastly bill! \"I disapprove,\"\r\n And yet She help'd me to defray it--\r\n What tokens of a Mother's love!\r\n O, bitter thought! I can't repay it.\r\n\r\n And here's the offer that I wrote\r\n In '33 to Lucy Diver;\r\n And here John Wylie's begging note,--\r\n He never paid me back a stiver.\r\n\r\n And here my feud with Major Spike,\r\n Our bet about the French Invasion;\r\n I must confess I acted like\r\n A donkey upon that occasion.\r\n\r\n Here's news from Paternoster Row!\r\n How mad I was when first I learnt it:\r\n They would not take my Book, and now\r\n I'd give a trifle to have burnt it.\r\n\r\n And here a pile of notes, at last,\r\n With \"love,\" and \"dove,\" and \"sever,\" \"never,\"--\r\n Though hope, though passion may be past,\r\n Their perfume is as sweet as ever.\r\n\r\n A human heart should beat for two,\r\n Despite the scoffs of single scorners;\r\n And all the hearths I ever knew\r\n Had got a pair of chimney corners.\r\n\r\n See here a double violet--\r\n Two locks of hair--a deal of scandal;\r\n I'll burn what only brings regret--\r\n Go, Betty, fetch a lighted candle.\r\n\nMY NEIGHBOUR ROSE.\r\n\n Though slender walls our hearths divide,\r\n No word has passed from either side,\r\n Your days, red-lettered all, must glide\r\n Unvexed by labour:\r\n I've seen you weep, and could have wept;\r\n I've heard you sing, and may have slept;\r\n Sometimes I hear your chimneys swept,\r\n My charming neighbour!\r\n\r\n Your pets are mine. Pray what may ail\r\n The pup, once eloquent of tail?\r\n I wonder why your nightingale\r\n Is mute at sunset!\r\n Your puss, demure and pensive, seems\r\n Too fat to mouse. She much esteems\r\n Yon sunny wall--and sleeps and dreams\r\n Of mice she once ate.\r\n\r\n Our tastes agree. I doat upon\r\n Frail jars, turquoise and celadon,\r\n The \"Wedding March\" of Mendelssohn,\r\n And _Penseroso_.\r\n When sorely tempted to purloin\r\n Your _pieta_ of Marc Antoine,\r\n Fair Virtue doth fair play enjoin,\r\n Fair Virtuoso!\r\n\r\n At times an Ariel, cruel-kind,\r\n Will kiss my lips, and stir your blind,\r\n And whisper low, \"She hides behind;\r\n Thou art not lonely.\"\r\n The tricksy sprite did erst assist\r\n At hushed Verona's moonlight tryst;\r\n Sweet Capulet! thou wert not kissed\r\n By light winds only.\r\n\r\n I miss the simple days of yore,\r\n When two long braids of hair you wore,\r\n And _chat botte_ was wondered o'er,\r\n In corner cosy.\r\n But gaze not back for tales like those:\r\n 'Tis all in order, I suppose,\r\n The Bud is now a blooming ROSE,--\r\n A rosy posy!\r\n\r\n Indeed, farewell to bygone years;\r\n How wonderful the change appears--\r\n For curates now and cavaliers\r\n In turn perplex you:\r\n The last are birds of feather gay,\r\n Who swear the first are birds of prey;\r\n I'd scare them all had I my way,\r\n But that might vex you.\r\n\r\n At times I've envied, it is true,\r\n That joyous hero, twenty-two,\r\n Who sent _bouquets_ and _billets-doux_,\r\n And wore a sabre.\r\n The rogue! how tenderly he wound\r\n His arm round one who never frowned;\r\n He loves you well. Now, is he bound\r\n To love _my_ neighbour?\r\n\r\n The bells are ringing. As is meet,\r\n White favours fascinate the street,\r\n Sweet faces greet me, rueful-sweet\r\n 'Twixt tears and laughter:\r\n They crowd the door to see her go--\r\n The bliss of one brings many woe--\r\n Oh! kiss the bride, and I will throw\r\n The old shoe after.\r\n\r\n What change in one short afternoon,--\r\n My Charming Neighbour gone,--so soon!\r\n Is yon pale orb her honey-moon\r\n Slow rising hither?\r\n O lady, wan and marvellous,\r\n How often have we communed thus;\r\n Sweet memories shall dwell with us,\r\n And joy go with her!\r\n\nPICCADILLY.\r\n\n Piccadilly!--shops, palaces, bustle, and breeze,\r\n The whirring of wheels, and the murmur of trees,\r\n By daylight, or nightlight,--or noisy, or stilly,--\r\n Whatever my mood is--I love Piccadilly.\r\n\r\n Wet nights, when the gas on the pavement is streaming,\r\n And young Love is watching, and old Love is dreaming,\r\n And Beauty is whirled off to conquest, where shrilly\r\n Cremona makes nimble thy toes, Piccadilly!\r\n\r\n Bright days, when we leisurely pace to and fro,\r\n And meet all the people we do or don't know,--\r\n Here is jolly old Brown, and his fair daughter Lillie;\r\n --No wonder, young pilgrim, you like Piccadilly!\r\n\r\n See yonder pair riding, how fondly they saunter!\r\n She smiles on her poet, whose heart's in a canter:\r\n Some envy her spouse, and some covet her filly,\r\n He envies them both,--he's an ass, Piccadilly!\r\n\r\n Now were I that gay bride, with a slave at my feet,\r\n I would choose me a house in my favourite street;\r\n Yes or no--I would carry my point, willy, nilly,\r\n If \"no,\"--pick a quarrel, if \"yes,\"--Piccadilly!\r\n\r\n From Primrose balcony, long ages ago,\r\n \"Old Q\" sat at gaze,--who now passes below?\r\n A frolicsome Statesman, the Man of the Day,\r\n A laughing philosopher, gallant and gay;\r\n No hero of story more manfully trod,\r\n Full of years, full of fame, and the world at his nod,\r\n _Heu, anni fugaces_! The wise and the silly,--\r\n Old P or old Q,--we must quit Piccadilly.\r\n\r\n Life is chequered,--a patchwork of smiles and of frowns;\r\n We value its ups, let us muse on its downs;\r\n\r\n There's a side that is bright, it will then turn us t'other,--\r\n One turn, if a good one, deserves such another.\r\n _These_ downs are delightful, _these_ ups are not hilly,--\r\n Let us turn one more turn ere we quit Piccadilly.\r\n\nTHE PILGRIMS OF PALL MALL.\r\n\n My little friend, so small and neat,\r\n Whom years ago I used to meet\r\n In Pall Mall daily;\r\n How cheerily you tripped away\r\n To work, it might have been to play,\r\n You tripped so gaily.\r\n\r\n And Time trips too. This moral means\r\n You then were midway in the teens\r\n That I was crowning;\r\n We never spoke, but when I smiled\r\n At morn or eve, I know, dear Child,\r\n You were not frowning.\r\n\r\n Each morning when we met, I think\r\n Some sentiment did us two link--\r\n Nor joy, nor sorrow;\r\n And then at eve, experience-taught,\r\n Our hearts returned upon the thought,--\r\n _We meet to-morrow_!\r\n\r\n And you were poor; and how?--and why?\r\n How kind to come! it was for my\r\n Especial grace meant!\r\n Had you a chamber near the stars,\r\n A bird,--some treasured plants in jars,\r\n About your casement?\r\n\r\n I often wander up and down,\r\n When morning bathes the silent town\r\n In golden glory:\r\n Perchance, unwittingly, I've heard\r\n Your thrilling-toned canary-bird\r\n From some third story.\r\n\r\n I've seen great changes since we met;--\r\n A patient little seamstress yet,\r\n With small means striving,\r\n Have you a Lilliputian spouse?\r\n And do you dwell in some doll's house?\r\n --Is baby thriving?\r\n\r\n Can bloom like thine--my heart grows chill--\r\n Have sought that bourne unwelcome still\r\n To bosom smarting?\r\n The most forlorn--what worms we are!--\r\n Would wish to finish this cigar\r\n Before departing.\r\n\r\n Sometimes I to Pall Mall repair,\r\n And see the damsels passing there;\r\n But if I try to\r\n Obtain one glance, they look discreet,\r\n As though they'd some one else to meet;--\r\n As have not _I_ too?\r\n\r\n Yet still I often think upon\r\n Our many meetings, come and gone!\r\n July--December!\r\n Now let us make a tryst, and when,\r\n Dear little soul, we meet again,--\r\n The mansion is preparing--then\r\n Thy Friend remember!\r\n\nGERALDINE.\r\n\n This simple child has claims\r\n On your sentiment--her name's\r\n Geraldine.\r\n Be tender--but beware,\r\n For she's frolicsome as fair,\r\n And fifteen.\r\n\r\n She has gifts that have not cloyed,\r\n For these gifts she has employed,\r\n And improved:\r\n She has bliss which lives and leans\r\n Upon loving--and that means\r\n She is loved.\r\n\r\n She has grace. A grace refined\r\n By sweet harmony of mind:\r\n And the Art,\r\n And the blessed Nature, too,\r\n Of a tender, and a true\r\n Little heart.\r\n\r\n And yet I must not vault\r\n Over any little fault\r\n That she owns:\r\n Or others might rebel,\r\n And might enviously swell\r\n In their zones.\r\n\r\n She is tricksy as the fays,\r\n Or her pussy when it plays\r\n With a string:\r\n She's a goose about her cat,\r\n And her ribbons--and all that\r\n Sort of thing.\r\n\r\n These foibles are a blot,\r\n Still she never can do what\r\n Is not nice,\r\n Such as quarrel, and give slaps--\r\n As I've known her get, perhaps,\r\n Once or twice.\r\n\r\n The spells that move her soul\r\n Are subtle--sad or droll--\r\n She can show\r\n That virtuoso whim\r\n Which consecrates our dim\r\n Long-ago.\r\n\r\n A love that is not sham\r\n For Stothard, Blake, and Lamb;\r\n And I've known\r\n Cordelia's sad eyes\r\n Cause angel-tears to rise\r\n In her own.\r\n\r\n Her gentle spirit yearns\r\n When she reads of Robin Burns--\r\n Luckless Bard!\r\n Had she blossomed in thy time,\r\n How rare had been the rhyme\r\n --And reward!\r\n\r\n Thrice happy then is he\r\n Who, planting such a Tree,\r\n Sees it bloom\r\n To shelter him--indeed\r\n We have sorrow as we speed\r\n To our doom!\r\n\r\n I am happy having grown\r\n Such a Sapling of my own;\r\n And I crave\r\n No garland for my brows,\r\n But peace beneath its boughs\r\n Till the grave.\r\n\n\"O DOMINE DEUS,\r\n\n \"O DOMINE DEUS,\r\n SPERAVI IN TE,\r\n O CARE MI JESU,\r\n NUNC LIBERA ME.\"\r\n\n Her quiet resting-place is far away,\r\n None dwelling there can tell you her sad story:\r\n The stones are mute. The stones could only say,\r\n \"A humble spirit passed away to glory.\"\r\n\r\n She loved the murmur of this mighty town,\r\n The lark rejoiced her from its lattice prison;\r\n A streamlet soothes her now,--the bird has flown,--\r\n Some dust is waiting there--a soul has risen.\r\n\r\n No city smoke to stain the heather bells,--\r\n Sigh, gentle winds, around my lone love sleeping,--\r\n She bore her burthen here, but now she dwells\r\n Where scorner never came, and none are weeping.\r\n\r\n O cough! O cruel cough! O gasping breath!\r\n These arms were round my darling at the latest:\r\n All scenes of death are woe--but painful death\r\n In those we dearly love is surely greatest!\r\n\r\n I could not die. HE willed it otherwise;\r\n My lot is here, and sorrow, wearing older,\r\n Weighs down the heart, but does not fill the eyes,\r\n And even friends may think that I am colder.\r\n\r\n I might have been more kind, more tender; now\r\n Repining wrings my bosom. I am grateful\r\n No eye can see this mark upon my brow,\r\n Yet even gay companionship is hateful.\r\n\r\n But when at times I steal away from these,\r\n And find her grave, and pray to be forgiven,\r\n And when I watch beside her on my knees,\r\n I think I am a little nearer heaven.\r\n\nTHE HOUSEMAID.\r\n\r\n \"Bright volumes of vapour through Lothbury glide.\"\r\n\n Alone she sits, with air resigned\r\n She watches by the window-blind:\r\n Poor girl! No doubt\r\n The pilgrims here despise thy lot:\r\n Thou canst not stir--because 'tis not\r\n Thy _Sunday out_.\r\n\r\n To play a game of hide and seek\r\n With dust and cobwebs all the week,\r\n Small pleasure yields:\r\n O dear, how nice it is to drop\r\n One's scrubbing-brush, one's pail and mop--\r\n And scour the fields!\r\n\r\n Poor Bodies some such Sundays know;\r\n They seldom come. How soon they go!\r\n But Souls can roam.\r\n And, lapt in visions airy-sweet,\r\n She sees in this too doleful street\r\n Her own loved Home!\r\n\r\n The road is now no road. She pranks\r\n A brawling stream with thymy banks;\r\n In Fancy's realm\r\n This post sustains no lamp--aloof\r\n It spreads above her parents' roof\r\n A gracious elm.\r\n\r\n How often has she valued there\r\n A father's aid--a mother's care:--\r\n She now has neither:\r\n And yet--such work in dreams is done,\r\n She still may sit and smile with one\r\n More dear than either.\r\n\r\n The poor can love through woe and pain,\r\n Although their homely speech is fain\r\n To halt in fetters:\r\n They feel as much, and do far more\r\n Than those, at times of meaner ore,\r\n Miscalled _their Betters_.\r\n\r\n Sometimes, on summer afternoons\r\n Of sundry sunny Mays and Junes--\r\n Meet Sunday weather,\r\n I pass her window by design,\r\n And wish her _Sunday out_ and mine\r\n Might fall together.\r\n\r\n For sweet it were my lot to dower\r\n With one brief joy, one white-robed flower;\r\n And prude, or preacher,\r\n Could hardly deem it much amiss\r\n To lay one on the path of this\r\n Forlorn young creature.\r\n\r\n Yet if her thought on wooing runs--\r\n And if her swain and she are ones\r\n Who fancy strolling,\r\n She'd like my nonsense less than his,\r\n And so it's better as it is--\r\n And that's consoling.\r\n\r\n Her dwelling is unknown to fame--\r\n Perchance she's fair--perchance her name\r\n Is _Car_, or _Kitty_;\r\n She may be _Jane_--she might be plain--\r\n For need the object of one's strain\r\n Be always pretty?\r\n\nTHE OLD GOVERNMENT CLERK.\r\n\n We knew an old Scribe, it was \"once on a time,\"--\r\n An era to set sober datists despairing;--\r\n Then let them despair! Darby sat in a chair\r\n Near the Cross that gave name to the village of Charing.\r\n\r\n Though silent and lean, Darby was not malign,--\r\n What hair he had left was more silver than sable;--\r\n He had also contracted a curve in his spine\r\n From bending too constantly over a table.\r\n\r\n His pay and expenditure, quite in accord,\r\n Were both on the strictest economy founded;\r\n His masters were known as the Sealing-wax Board,\r\n Who ruled where red tape and snug places abounded.\r\n\r\n In his heart he looked down on this dignified knot,--\r\n For why, the forefather of one of these senators,\r\n A rascal concerned in the Gunpowder Plot,\r\n Had been barber-surgeon to Darby's progenitors.\r\n\r\n Poor fool! Life is all a vagary of Luck,--\r\n Still, for thirty long years of genteel destitution\r\n He'd been writing State Papers, which means he had stuck\r\n Some heads and some tails to much circumlocution.\r\n\r\n This sounds rather weary and dreary; but, no!\r\n Though strictly inglorious, his days were quiescent,\r\n His red-tape was tied in a true-lover's bow\r\n Each night when returning to Rosemary Crescent.\r\n\r\n There Joan meets him smiling, the young ones are there,\r\n His coming is bliss to the half-dozen wee things;\r\n Of his advent the dog and the cat are aware,\r\n And Phyllis, neat-handed, is laying the tea-things.\r\n\r\n East wind! sob eerily! sing, kettle! cheerily!\r\n Baby's abed,--but its father will rock it;\r\n Little ones boast your permission to toast\r\n The cake that good fellow brought home in his pocket.\r\n\r\n This greeting the silent old Clerk understands,--\r\n His friends he can love, had he foes, he could mock them;\r\n So met, so surrounded, his bosom expands,--\r\n Some tongues have more need of such scenes to unlock them.\r\n\r\n And Darby, at least, is resigned to his lot,\r\n And Joan, rather proud of the sphere he's adorning,\r\n Has well-nigh forgotten that Gunpowder Plot,\r\n And _he_ won't recall it till ten the next morning.\r\n\r\n A kindly good man, quite a stranger to fame,\r\n His heart still is green, though his head shows a hoar lock;\r\n Perhaps his particular star is to blame,--\r\n It may be, he never took time by the forelock.\r\n\r\n A day must arrive when, in pitiful case,\r\n He will drop from his Branch, like a fruit more than mellow;\r\n Is he yet to be found in his usual place?\r\n Or is he already forgotten, poor fellow?\r\n\r\n If still at his duty he soon will arrive,--\r\n He passes this turning because it is shorter,--\r\n If not within sight as the clock's striking five,\r\n We shall see him before it is chiming the quarter.\r\n\nA WISH.\r\n\n To the south of the church, and beneath yonder yew,\r\n A pair of child-lovers I've seen,\r\n More than once were they there, and the years of the two,\r\n When added, might number thirteen.\r\n\r\n They sat on the grave that has never a stone\r\n The name of the dead to determine,\r\n It was Life paying Death a brief visit--alone\r\n A notable text for a sermon.\r\n\r\n They tenderly prattled; what was it they said?\r\n The turf on that hillock was new;\r\n Dear Little Ones, did ye know aught of the Dead,\r\n Or could he be heedful of you?\r\n\r\n I wish to believe, and believe it I must,\r\n Her father beneath them was laid:\r\n I wish to believe,--I will take it on trust,\r\n That father knew all that they said.\r\n\r\n My own, you are five, very nearly the age\r\n Of that poor little fatherless child:\r\n And some day a true-love your heart will engage,\r\n When on earth I my last may have smiled.\r\n\r\n Then visit my grave, like a good little lass,\r\n Where'er it may happen to be,\r\n And if any daisies should peer through the grass,\r\n Be sure they are kisses from me.\r\n\r\n And place not a stone to distinguish my name,\r\n For strangers to see and discuss:\r\n But come with your lover, as these lovers came,\r\n And talk to him sweetly of _us_.\r\n\r\n And while you are smiling, your father will smile\r\n Such a dear little daughter to have,\r\n But mind,--O yes, mind you are happy the while--\r\n _I wish you to visit my Grave_.\r\n\nTHE JESTER'S PLEA.\r\n\r\n These verses were published in 1862, in a volume of Poems by\r\n several hands, entitled \"An Offering to Lancashire.\"\r\n\n The World! Was jester ever in\r\n A viler than the present?\r\n Yet if it ugly be--as sin,\r\n It almost is--as pleasant!\r\n It is a merry world (_pro tem._)\r\n And some are gay, and therefore\r\n It pleases them--but some condemn\r\n The fun they do not care for.\r\n\r\n It is an ugly world. Offend\r\n Good people--how they wrangle!\r\n The manners that they never mend!\r\n The characters they mangle!\r\n They eat, and drink, and scheme, and plod,\r\n And go to church on Sunday--\r\n And many are afraid of God--\r\n And more of _Mrs. Grundy_.\r\n\r\n The time for Pen and Sword was when\r\n \"My ladye fayre,\" for pity\r\n Could tend her wounded knight, and then\r\n Grow tender at his ditty!\r\n Some ladies now make pretty songs,--\r\n And some make pretty nurses:--\r\n Some men are good for righting wrongs,--\r\n And some for writing verses.\r\n\r\n I wish We better understood\r\n The tax that poets levy!--\r\n I know the Muse is very _good_--\r\n I think she's rather heavy:\r\n She now compounds for winning ways\r\n By morals of the sternest--\r\n Methinks the lays of now-a-days\r\n Are painfully in earnest.\r\n\r\n When Wisdom halts, I humbly try\r\n To make the most of Folly:\r\n If Pallas be unwilling, I\r\n Prefer to flirt with Polly,--\r\n To quit the goddess for the maid\r\n Seems low in lofty musers--\r\n But Pallas is a haughty jade--\r\n And beggars can't be choosers.\r\n\r\n I do not wish to see the slaves\r\n Of party, stirring passion,\r\n Or psalms quite superseding staves,\r\n Or piety \"the fashion.\"\r\n I bless the Hearts where pity glows,\r\n Who, here together banded,\r\n Are holding out a hand to those\r\n That wait so empty-handed!\r\n\r\n A righteous Work!--My Masters, may\r\n A Jester by confession,\r\n Scarce noticed join, half sad, half gay,\r\n The close of your procession?\r\n The motley here seems out of place\r\n With graver robes to mingle,\r\n But if one tear bedews his face,\r\n Forgive the bells their jingle.\r\n\nTHE OLD CRADLE.\r\n\n And this was your Cradle? why, surely, my Jenny,\r\n Such slender dimensions go somewhat to show\r\n You were a delightfully small Pic-a-ninny\r\n Some nineteen or twenty short summers ago.\r\n\r\n Your baby-days flowed in a much-troubled channel;\r\n I see you as then in your impotent strife,\r\n A tight little bundle of wailing and flannel,\r\n Perplexed with that newly-found fardel called Life.\r\n\r\n To hint at an infantine frailty is scandal;\r\n Let bygones be bygones--and somebody knows\r\n It was bliss such a Baby to dance and to dandle,\r\n Your cheeks were so velvet--so rosy your toes.\r\n\r\n Ay, here is your Cradle, and Hope, a bright spirit,\r\n With Love now is watching beside it, I know.\r\n They guard the small nest you yourself did inherit\r\n Some nineteen or twenty short summers ago.\r\n\r\n It is Hope gilds the future,--Love welcomes it smiling;\r\n Thus wags this old world, therefore stay not to ask--\r\n \"My future bids fair, is my future beguiling?\"\r\n If masked, still it pleases--then raise not the mask.\r\n\r\n Is Life a poor coil some would gladly be doffing?\r\n He is riding post-haste who their wrongs will adjust;\r\n For at most 'tis a footstep from cradle to coffin--\r\n From a spoonful of pap to a mouthful of dust.\r\n\r\n Then smile as your future is smiling, my Jenny!\r\n Though blossoms of promise are lost in the rose,\r\n I still see the face of my small Pic-a-ninny\r\n Unchanged, for these cheeks are as blooming as those.\r\n\r\n Ay, here is your Cradle! much, much to my liking,\r\n Though nineteen or twenty long winters have sped;\r\n But, hark! as I'm talking there's six o'clock striking,\r\n It is time JENNY'S BABY should be in its bed!\r\n\nTO MY MISTRESS.\r\n\n O Countess, each succeeding year\r\n Reveals that Time is wasting here:\r\n He soon will do his worst by you,\r\n And garner all your roses too!\r\n\r\n It pleases Time to fold his wings\r\n Around our best and brightest things;\r\n He'll mar your damask cheek, as now\r\n He stamps his mark upon my brow.\r\n\r\n The same mute planets rise and shine\r\n To rule your days and nights as mine,\r\n I once was young as you,--and see...!\r\n You some day will be old as me.\r\n\r\n And yet I bear a mighty charm\r\n Which shields me from your worst alarm;\r\n And bids me gaze, with front sublime,\r\n On all these ravages of Time.\r\n\r\n You boast a charm that all would prize,\r\n This gift of mine, which you despise,\r\n May, like enough, still hold its sway\r\n When all your boast has passed away.\r\n\r\n My charm may long embalm the lures\r\n Of eyes, as sweet to me as yours:\r\n And ages hence the great and good\r\n Will judge you as I choose they should.\r\n\r\n In days to come the count or clown,\r\n With whom I still shall win renown,\r\n Will only know that you were fair\r\n Because I chanced to say you were.\r\n\r\n Fair Countess--I wax grey--awhile\r\n Your youthful swains will sigh or smile;\r\n But should you scorn, for smile or sigh,\r\n A grey old Bard--as great as I?\r\n\r\n KENWOOD, _July 21, 1864_.\r\n\nTO MY MISTRESS'S BOOTS\r\n\n They nearly strike me dumb,\r\n And I tremble when they come\r\n Pit-a-pat:\r\n This palpitation means\r\n That these boots are Geraldine's--\r\n Think of that!\r\n\r\n Oh, where did hunter win\r\n So delicate a skin\r\n For her feet?\r\n You lucky little kid,\r\n You perished, so you did,\r\n For my sweet.\r\n\r\n The faery stitching gleams\r\n On the toes, and in the seams,\r\n And reveals\r\n That Pixies were the wags\r\n Who tipped these funny tags,\r\n And these heels.\r\n\r\n What soles! so little worn!\r\n Had Crusoe--soul forlorn!--\r\n Chanced to view\r\n _One_ printed near the tide,\r\n How hard he would have tried\r\n For the two!\r\n\r\n For Gerry's debonair,\r\n And innocent, and fair\r\n As a rose:\r\n She's an angel in a frock,\r\n With a fascinating cock\r\n To her nose.\r\n\r\n Those simpletons who squeeze\r\n Their extremities to please\r\n Mandarins,\r\n Would positively flinch\r\n From venturing to pinch\r\n Geraldine's.\r\n\r\n Cinderella's _lefts and rights_\r\n To Geraldine's were frights:\r\n And, in truth,\r\n The damsel, deftly shod,\r\n Has dutifully trod\r\n From her youth.\r\n\r\n The mansion--ay, and more,\r\n The cottage of the poor,\r\n Where there's grief,\r\n Or sickness, are her choice--\r\n And the music of her voice\r\n Brings relief.\r\n\r\n Come, Gerry, since it suits\r\n Such a pretty Puss-in-Boots\r\n These to don,\r\n Set your little hand awhile\r\n On my shoulder, dear, and I'll\r\n Put them on.\r\n\r\n ALBURY, _June 29, 1864_.\r\n\nTHE ROSE AND THE RING.\r\n\r\n (Christmas 1854, and Christmas 1863.)\r\n\n She smiles--but her heart is in sable,\r\n And sad as her Christmas is chill:\r\n She reads, and her book is the fable\r\n He penned for her while she was ill.\r\n It is nine years ago since he wrought it\r\n Where reedy old Tiber is king,\r\n And chapter by chapter he brought it--\r\n And read her the Rose and the Ring.\r\n\r\n And when it was printed, and gaining\r\n Renown with all lovers of glee,\r\n He sent her this copy containing\r\n His comical little _croquis_;\r\n A sketch of a rather droll couple--\r\n She's pretty--he's quite t'other thing!\r\n He begs (with a spine vastly supple)\r\n She will study the Rose and the Ring.\r\n\r\n It pleased the kind Wizard to send her\r\n The last and the best of his toys,\r\n His heart had a sentiment tender\r\n For innocent women and boys:\r\n And though he was great as a scorner,\r\n The guileless were safe from his sting,--\r\n How sad is past mirth to the mourner!--\r\n A tear on the Rose and the Ring!\r\n\r\n She reads--I may vainly endeavour\r\n Her mirth-chequered grief to pursue;\r\n For she hears she has lost--and for ever--\r\n A Heart that was known by so few;\r\n But I wish on the shrine of his glory\r\n One fair little blossom to fling;\r\n And you see there's a nice little story\r\n Attached to the Rose and the Ring!\r\n\nTO MY OLD FRIEND POSTUMUS.\r\n\r\n(J. G.)\r\n\n My Friend, our few remaining years\r\n Are hasting to an end,\r\n They glide away, and lines are here\r\n That time will never mend;\r\n Thy blameless life avails thee not,--\r\n Alas, my dear old Friend!\r\n\r\n From mother Earth's green orchard trees\r\n The fairest fruit is blown,\r\n The lad was gay who slumbers near,\r\n The lass he loved is gone;\r\n Death lifts the burthen from the poor,\r\n And will not spare the throne.\r\n\r\n And vainly are we fenced about\r\n From peril, day and night,\r\n The awful rapids must be shot,\r\n Our shallop is but slight;\r\n So pray, when parting, we descry\r\n A cheering beacon-light.\r\n\r\n O pleasant Earth! This happy home!\r\n The darling at my knee!\r\n My own dear wife! Thyself, old Friend!\r\n And must it come to me\r\n That any face shall fill my place\r\n Unknown to them and thee?\r\n\nRUSSET PITCHER.\r\n\r\n \"The pot goeth so long to the water til at length it commeth\r\n broken home.\"\r\n\n Away, ye simple ones, away!\r\n Bring no vain fancies hither;\r\n The brightest dreams of youth decay,\r\n The fairest roses wither.\r\n\r\n Ay, since this fountain first was planned,\r\n And Dryad learnt to drink,\r\n Have lovers held, knit hand in hand,\r\n Sweet parley at its brink.\r\n\r\n From youth to age this waterfall\r\n Most tunefully flows on,\r\n But where, ay, tell me where are all\r\n The constant lovers gone?\r\n\r\n The falcon on the turtle preys,\r\n And beardless vows are brittle;\r\n The brightest dream of youth decays,--\r\n Ah, love is good for little.\r\n\r\n \"Sweet maiden, set thy pitcher down,\r\n And heed a Truth neglected:--\r\n _The more this sorry world is known,\r\n The less it is respected_.\r\n\r\n \"Though youth is ardent, gay, and bold,\r\n It flatters and beguiles;\r\n Though Giles is young, and I am old,\r\n Ne'er trust thy heart to Giles.\r\n\r\n \"Thy pitcher may some luckless day\r\n Be broken coming hither;\r\n Thy doting slave may prove a knave,--\r\n The fairest roses wither.\"\r\n\r\n She laughed outright, she scorned him quite,\r\n She deftly filled her pitcher;\r\n For that dear sight an anchorite\r\n Might deem himself the richer.\r\n\r\n Ill-fated damsel!

Then dames in castles dwelt,\r\n Nor dared to show their noses:\r\n Then passion that could not be spelt,\r\n Was hinted at in posies.\r\n Such shifts make modern Cupid laugh:\r\n For sweethearts, in love's tremor,\r\n Now tell their vows by telegraph--\r\n And go off in the steamer!\r\n\r\n The earth is still our Mother Earth--\r\n Young shepherds still fling capers\r\n In flowery groves that ring with mirth--\r\n Where old ones read the papers.\r\n Romance, as tender and as true,\r\n Our Isle has never quitted:\r\n So lads and lasses when they woo\r\n Are hardly to be pitied!\r\n\r\n Oh, yes! young love is lovely yet--\r\n With faith and honour plighted:\r\n I love to see a pair so met--\r\n Youth--Beauty--all united.\r\n Such dear ones may they ever wear\r\n The roses Fortune gave them:\r\n Ah, know we such a Blessed Pair?\r\n I think we do! GOD SAVE THEM!\r\n\r\n Our lot is cast on pleasant days,\r\n In not unpleasant places--\r\n Young ladies now have pretty ways,\r\n As well as pretty faces;\r\n So never sigh for what has been,\r\n And let us cease complaining\r\n That we have loved when Our Dear Queen\r\n Victoria was reigning!\r\n\nGERALDINE GREEN."

Although no moral clings\r\n To Di's soft eyes, and sandal strings,\r\n We've had our quarrels!--\r\n I think that Smith is thought an ass,\r\n I know that when they walk in grass\r\n She wears balmorals.\r\n\nTHE SKELETON IN THE CUPBOARD.\r\n\n The characters of great and small\r\n Come ready made, we can't bespeak one;\r\n Their sides are many, too,--and all\r\n (Except ourselves) have got a weak one.\r\n Some sanguine people love for life--\r\n Some love their hobby till it flings them.--\r\n And many love a pretty wife\r\n For love of the _eclat_ she brings them!\r\n\r\n We all have secrets--you have one\r\n Which may not be your charming spouse's,--\r\n We all lock up a skeleton\r\n In some grim chamber of our houses;\r\n Familiars who exhaust their days\r\n And nights in probing where our smart is,\r\n And who, excepting spiteful ways,\r\n Are quiet, confidential \"parties.\"\r\n\r\n We hug the phantom we detest,\r\n We rarely let it cross our portals:\r\n It is a most exacting guest,--\r\n Now are we not afflicted mortals?\r\n Your neighbour Gay, that joyous wight,\r\n As Dives rich, and bold as Hector,\r\n Poor Gay steals twenty times a-night,\r\n On shaking knees, to see his spectre.\r\n\r\n Old Dives fears a pauper fate,\r\n And hoarding is his thriving passion;\r\n Some piteous souls anticipate\r\n A waistcoat straiter than the fashion.\r\n She, childless, pines,--that lonely wife,\r\n And hidden tears are bitter shedding;\r\n And he may tremble all his life,\r\n And die,--but not of that he's dreading.\r\n\r\n Ah me, the World! how fast it spins!\r\n The beldams shriek, the caldron bubbles;\r\n They dance, and stir it for our sins,\r\n And we must drain it for our troubles.\r\n We toil, we groan,--the cry for love\r\n Mounts upward from this seething city,\r\n And yet I know we have above\r\n A FATHER, infinite in pity.\r\n\r\n When Beauty smiles, when Sorrow weeps,\r\n When sunbeams play, when shadows darken,\r\n One inmate of our dwelling keeps\r\n A ghastly carnival--but hearken!\r\n How dry the rattle of those bones!--\r\n The sound was not to make you start meant,--\r\n Stand by! Your humble servant owns\r\n The Tenant of this Dark Apartment.\r\n\nTHE VICTORIA CROSS.\r\n\r\n A LEGEND OF TUNBRIDGE WELLS.\r\n\n She gave him a draught freshly drawn from the springlet,--\r\n O Tunbridge, thy waters are bitter, alas!\r\n But Love finds an ambush in dimple and ringlet,--\r\n \"Thy health, pretty maiden!\"--he emptied the glass.\r\n\r\n He saw, and he loved her, nor cared he to quit her,\r\n The oftener he came, why the longer he stayed;\r\n Indeed, though the spring was exceedingly bitter,\r\n We found him eternally pledging the maid.\r\n\r\n A _preux chevalier_, and but lately a cripple,\r\n He met with his hurt where a regiment fell,\r\n But worse was he wounded when staying to tipple\r\n A bumper to \"Phoebe, the Nymph of the Well.\"\r\n\r\n Some swore he was old, that his laurels were faded,\r\n All vowed she was vastly too nice for a nurse;\r\n But Love never looked on such matters as they did,--\r\n She took the brave soldier for better or worse.\r\n\r\n And here is the home of her fondest election,--\r\n The walls may be worn but the ivy is green;\r\n And here has she tenderly twined her affection\r\n Around a true soldier who bled for his Queen.\r\n\r\n See, yonder he sits, where the church flings its shadows;\r\n What child is that spelling the epitaphs there?\r\n To that imp its devout and devoted old dad owes\r\n New zest in thanksgiving--fresh fervour in prayer.\r\n\r\n Ere long, ay, too soon, a sad concourse will darken\r\n The doors of that church, and that tranquil abode;\r\n His place then no longer will know him--but, hearken,\r\n The widow and orphan appeal to their God.\r\n\r\n Much peace will be hers! \"If our lot must be lowly,\r\n Resemble thy father, though with us no more;\"\r\n And only on days that are high or are holy,\r\n She will show him the cross that her warrior wore.\r\n\r\n So taught, he will rather take after his father,\r\n And wear a long sword to our enemies' loss;\r\n Till some day or other he'll bring to his mother\r\n Victoria's gift--the Victoria Cross!\r\n\r\n And still she'll be charming, though ringlet and dimple\r\n Perchance may have lost their peculiar spell;\r\n And at times she will quote, with complacency simple,\r\n The compliments paid to the Nymph of the Well.\r\n\r\n And then will her darling, like all good and true ones,\r\n Console and sustain her,--the weak and the strong;--\r\n And some day or other two black eyes or blue ones\r\n Will smile on his path as he journeys along.\r\n\r\n Wherever they win him, whoever his Phoebe,\r\n Of course of all beauties she must be the _belle_,\r\n If at Tunbridge he chance to fall in with a Hebe,\r\n He will not fall out with a draught from the Well.\r\n\nST. GEORGE'S, HANOVER SQUARE.\r\n\r\n Dans le bonheur de nos meilleurs amis nous trouvons souvent\r\n quelque chose qui ne nous plait pris entierement.\r\n\n She passed up the aisle on the arm of her sire,\r\n A delicate lady in bridal attire,--\r\n Fair emblem of virgin simplicity;--\r\n Half London was there, and, my word, there were few,\r\n Who stood by the altar, or hid in a pew,\r\n But envied Lord Nigel's felicity.\r\n\r\n O beautiful Bride, still so meek in thy splendour,\r\n So frank in thy love, and its trusting surrender,\r\n Departing you leave us the town dim!\r\n May happiness wing to thy bosom, unsought,\r\n And Nigel, esteeming his bliss as he ought,\r\n Prove worthy thy worship,--confound him!\r\n\nSORRENTO.\r\n\r\n Sorrento, stella d'amore.--VINCENZO DA FILICAIA.\r\n\n Sorrento! Love's Star! Land\r\n Of myrtle and vine,\r\n I come from a far land\r\n To kneel at thy shrine;\r\n Thy brows wear a garland,\r\n Oh, weave one for mine!\r\n\r\n Thine image, fair city,\r\n Smiles fair in the sea,--\r\n A youth sings a pretty\r\n Song, tempered with glee,--\r\n The mirth and the ditty\r\n Are mournful to me.\r\n\r\n Ah, sea boy, how strange is\r\n The carol you sing!\r\n Let Psyche, who ranges\r\n The gardens of Spring,\r\n Remember the changes\r\n December will bring.\r\n\r\n MARCH, 1862.\r\n\nJANET.\r\n\n I see her portrait hanging there,\r\n Her face, but only half as fair,\r\n And while I scan it,\r\n Old thoughts come back, by new thoughts met--\r\n She smiles. I never can forget\r\n The smile of Janet.\r\n\r\n A matchless grace of head and hand,\r\n Can Art pourtray an air more grand?\r\n It cannot--can it?\r\n And then the brow, the lips, the eyes--\r\n You look as if you could despise\r\n Devotion, Janet.\r\n\r\n I knew her as a child, and said\r\n She ought to have inhabited\r\n A brighter planet:\r\n Some seem more meet for angel wings\r\n Than Mother Nature's apron strings,--\r\n And so did Janet.\r\n\r\n She grew in beauty, and in pride,\r\n Her waist was slim, and once I tried,\r\n In sport, to span it,\r\n At Church, with only this result,\r\n They threatened with _quicunque vult_\r\n Both me and Janet.\r\n\r\n She fairer grew, till Love became\r\n In me a very ardent flame,\r\n With Faith to fan it:\r\n Alas, I played the fool, and she ...\r\n The fault of both lay much with me,\r\n But more with Janet.\r\n\r\n For Janet chose a cruel part,--\r\n How many win a tender heart\r\n And then trepan it!\r\n She left my bark to swim or sink,\r\n Nor seemed to care--and yet, I think,\r\n You liked me, Janet.\r\n\r\n The old old tale! you know the rest--\r\n The heart that slumbered in her breast\r\n Was soft as granite:\r\n Who breaks a heart, and then omits\r\n To gather up its broken bits,\r\n Is heartless, Janet.\r\n\r\n I'm wiser now--for when I curse\r\n My Fate, a voice cries, \"Bad or worse\r\n You must not ban it:\r\n Take comfort, you are quits, for if\r\n You mourn a Love, stark dead and stiff,\r\n Why so does Janet.\"\r\n\nBERANGER.\r\n\n Cast adrift on this sphere\r\n Where my fellows were born,\r\n None gave me a tear,\r\n I was weakly--forlorn.\r\n\r\n My plaint for their spurning\r\n To heaven took wing,--\r\n Sweet voices said, yearning,\r\n \"Sing, Little One, sing!\"\r\n\r\n My lot, as I rove,\r\n Is to sing for the throng;--\r\n And will not they love\r\n The poor Child for his song?\r\n\nTHE BEAR PIT.\r\n\r\n AT THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS.\r\n\n We liked the bear's serio-comical face,\r\n As he lolled with a lazy, a lumbering grace;\r\n Said Slyboots to me--(just as if _she_ had none),\r\n \"Papa, let's give Bruin a bit of your bun.\"\r\n\r\n Says I, \"A plum bun might please wistful old Bruin,\r\n For he can't eat the stone that the cruel boy threw in;\r\n Stick _yours_ on the point of mama's parasol,\r\n And then he will climb to the top of the pole.\r\n\r\n \"Some bears have got two legs, some bears have got more,--\r\n Be good to old bears if they've no legs or four:\r\n Of duty to age you should never be careless,\r\n My dear, I am bald--and I soon shall be hairless!\r\n\r\n \"The gravest aversion exists amongst bears\r\n For rude forward persons who give themselves airs,\r\n We know how some graceless young people were mauled\r\n For plaguing a prophet, and calling him bald.\r\n\r\n \"Strange ursine devotion!

The price in town\r\n Is half a rose-bud--half-a-crown!\r\n And cabinets and chandeliers,\r\n The legacy of courtly years;\r\n And missals wrought by hooded monks,\r\n Who snored in cells the size of trunks,\r\n And tolled a bell, and told a bead,\r\n (Indebted to the hood indeed!)\r\n Stained windows dark, and pillowed light,\r\n Soft sofas, where the Sybarite\r\n In bliss reclining, might devour\r\n The best last novel of the hour.\r\n On silken cushion, happy starred,\r\n A shaggy Skye kept wistful guard:\r\n While drowsy-eyed, would dozing swing\r\n A parrot in his golden ring.\r\n\r\n All these I saw one blissful day,\r\n And more than now I care to name;\r\n Here, lately shut, that work-box lay,\r\n There, stood your own embroidery frame.\r\n And over this piano bent\r\n A Form from some pure region sent.\r\n Despair, some lively trope devise\r\n To prove the splendour of her eyes!\r\n Her mouth had all the rose-bud's hue--\r\n A most delicious rose-bud too.\r\n Her auburn tresses lustrous shone,\r\n In massy clusters, like your own;\r\n And as her fingers pressed the keys,\r\n How strangely they resembled these!\r\n\r\n Yes, you, you only, Lady Fair,\r\n Adorned a Castle in the Air,\r\n Where life, without the least foundation,\r\n Became a charming occupation.\r\n We heard, with much sublime disdain,\r\n The far-off thunder of Cockaigne;\r\n And saw, through rifts of silver cloud,\r\n The rolling smoke that hid the crowd.\r\n With souls released from earthly tether,\r\n We hymned the tender moon together.\r\n Our sympathy from night to noon\r\n Rose crescent with that crescent moon;\r\n The night was shorter than the song,\r\n And happy as the day was long.\r\n We lived and loved in cloudless climes,\r\n And even died (in verse) sometimes.\r\n\r\n Yes, you, you only, Lady Fair,\r\n Adorned my Castle in the Air.\r\n Now, tell me, could you dwell content\r\n In such a baseless tenement?\r\n Or could so delicate a flower\r\n Exist in such a breezy bower?\r\n Because, if you would settle in it,\r\n 'Twere built for love, in half a minute.\r\n\r\n What's love? Why love (for two) at best,\r\n Is only a delightful jest;\r\n But sad indeed for one or three,\r\n --I wish you'd come and jest with me.\r\n\r\n You shake your head and wonder why\r\n The cynosure of dear Mayfair\r\n Should lend me even half a sigh\r\n Towards building Castles in the Air.\r\n \"I've music, books, and all you say,\r\n To make the gravest lady gay.\r\n I'm told my essays show research,\r\n My sketches have endowed a church;\r\n I've partners who have brilliant parts,\r\n I've lovers who have broken hearts.\r\n Poor Polly has not nerves to fly,\r\n And why should Mop return to Skye?\r\n To realize your _tete-a-tete_\r\n Might jeopardize a giddy pate;\r\n As grief is not akin to guilt,\r\n I'm sorry if your Castle's built.\"\r\n\r\n Ah me--alas for Fancy's flights\r\n In noonday dreams and waking nights!\r\n The pranks that brought poor souls mishap\r\n When baby Time was fond of pap;\r\n And still will cheat with feigning joys,\r\n While ladies smile, and men are boys.\r\n The blooming rose conceals an asp,\r\n And bliss, coquetting, flies the grasp.\r\n How vain the prize that pleased at first!\r\n But myrtles fade, and bubbles burst.\r\n The cord has snapt that held my kite;--\r\n My friends neglect the books I write,\r\n And wonder why the author's spleeny!\r\n I dance, but dancing's not the thing;\r\n They will not listen though I sing\r\n \"Fra poco,\" almost like Rubini!\r\n The poet's harp beyond my reach is,\r\n The Senate will not stand my speeches,\r\n I risk a jest,--its point of course\r\n Is marred by some disturbing force;\r\n I doubt the friends that Fortune gave me;\r\n But have I friends from whom to save me?\r\n Farewell,--can aught for her be willed\r\n Whose every wish is all fulfilled?\r\n Farewell,--could wishing weave a spell,\r\n There's promise in the word \"farewell.\"\r\n\r\n The lady's smile showed no remorse,--\r\n \"My worthless toy hath lost its gilding,\"\r\n I murmured with pathetic force,\r\n \"And here's an end of castle building;\"\r\n Then strode away in mood morose,\r\n To blame the Sage of Careless Close,\r\n He trifled with my tale of sorrow,--\r\n \"What's marred to-day is made to-morrow;\r\n Romance can roam not far from home,\r\n Knock gently, she must answer soon;\r\n I'm sixty-five, and yet I strive\r\n To hang my garland on the moon.\"\r\n\nGLYCERE.\r\n\n OLD MAN.\r\n\r\n In gala dress, and smiling!

Selina was pleased to accept it;\r\n She gave me a rose-bud to keep--and I've kept it.\r\n Thus the moments flew by, and I think, in my heart,\r\n When one vowed one must go, two were loth to depart.\r\n\r\n The twilight is near, we no longer can stay;\r\n The steeds are remounted, and wheels roll away.\r\n The ladies _condemn_ Mrs. Jones, as the phrase is,\r\n But vie with each other in chanting my praises.\r\n\r\n \"He has so much to say,\" cries the fair Mrs. Legge;\r\n \"How amusing he was about missing the peg!\"\r\n \"What a beautiful smile!\" says the plainest Miss Gunn.\r\n All echo, \"He's charming! Delightful! What fun!\"\r\n\r\n This sounds rather nice, and it's perfectly clear it\r\n Would have sounded more nice if I'd happened to hear it;\r\n The men were less civil, and gave me a rub,\r\n So I happened to hear when I went to the Club.\r\n\r\n Says Brown, \"I shall drop Mr. Placid's society;\"\r\n But Brown is a prig of improper propriety.\r\n \"Confound him,\" says Smith (who from cant's not exempt),\r\n \"Why, he'll bring immorality into contempt.\"\r\n\r\n Says I (to myself), when I found me alone,\r\n \"My wife has my heart, is it wholly her own?\"\r\n And further, says I (to myself), \"I'll be shot\r\n If I know if Selina adores me or not.\"\r\n\r\n Says Jones, \"I've just come from the _scavi_, at Veii,\r\n And I've bought some remarkably fine scarabaei.\"\r\n\nTO PARENTS AND GUARDIANS.\r\n\n Papa was deep in weekly bills,\r\n Mama was doing Fanny's frills,\r\n Her gentle face full\r\n Of woe; said she, \"I do declare\r\n He can't go back in such a Pair,\r\n They're too disgraceful!\"\r\n\r\n \"Confound it,\" quoth Papa--perhaps\r\n The ban was deeper, but the lapse\r\n Of time has drowned it:\r\n Besides, 'tis badness to suppose\r\n A worse, when goodness only knows\r\n He meant _Confound it_.\r\n\r\n The butcher's book--that unctuous diary--\r\n Had made my Parent's temper fiery,\r\n And bubble over:\r\n So quite in spite he flung it down,\r\n And spilt the ink, and spoilt his own\r\n Fine table-cover\r\n\r\n Of scarlet cloth! Papa cried \"pish!\"\r\n Which did not mean he did not wish\r\n He'd been more heedful:\r\n \"Good luck,\" said he, \"this cloth will dip,\r\n And make a famous pair--get Snip\r\n To do the needful.\"\r\n\r\n 'Twas thus that I went back to school\r\n In garb no boy could ridicule,\r\n And eft becoming\r\n A jolly child--I plunged in debt\r\n For tarts--and promised fair to get\r\n The prize for summing.\r\n\r\n But, no! my schoolmates soon began\r\n Again to mock my outward man,\r\n And make me hate 'em!\r\n Long sitting will broadcloth abrade,\r\n The dye wore off--and so displayed\r\n A red substratum!\r\n\r\n To both my Parents then I flew--\r\n Mama shed tears, Papa cried \"Pooh,\r\n Come, stop this racket:\"\r\n He'd still some cloth, so Snip was bid\r\n To stitch me on two tails; he did,\r\n And spoilt my jacket!\r\n\r\n And then the boys, despite my wails,\r\n Would slily come and lift my tails,\r\n And smack me soundly.\r\n O, weak Mama! O, wrathful Dad!\r\n Although your exploits drove me mad,\r\n Ye loved me fondly.\r\n\r\n Good Friends, our little ones (who feel\r\n Such bitter wounds, which only heal\r\n As wisdom mellows)\r\n Need sympathy in deed and word;\r\n So never let them look absurd\r\n Beside their fellows.\r\n\r\n My wife, who likes the Things I've doft\r\n Sublimes her sentiments, for oft,\r\n She'll take, and ... air them!\r\n --You little Puss, you love this pair,\r\n And yet you never seem to care\r\n To let me wear them.\r\n\nBEGGARS.\r\n\n I am pacing Pall Mall in a wrapt reverie,--\r\n I am thinking if Sophy is thinking of me,--\r\n When up creeps a ragged and shivering wretch,\r\n Who seems to be well on his way to Jack Ketch.\r\n\r\n He has got a bad face, and a shocking bad hat,\r\n A comb in his fist, and he sees I'm a flat;\r\n For he says, \"Buy a comb, it's a fine un to wear;\r\n Just try it, my Lord, through your whiskers and 'air.\"\r\n\r\n He eyes my gold chain, as if anxious to crib it;\r\n He looks just as if he'd been blown from a gibbet.\r\n I pause ... and pass on--and beside the club fire\r\n I settle that Sophy is all I desire.\r\n\r\n As I walk from the club, and am deep in a strophe,\r\n Which rolls upon all that's delicious in Sophy,\r\n I half tumble over an \"object\" unnerving--\r\n So frightful a hag must be \"highly deserving.\"\r\n\r\n She begs--my heart's moved--but I've much circumspection;\r\n I stifle remorse with the soothing reflection\r\n That cases of vice are by no means a rarity--\r\n The worst vice of all's indiscriminate charity.\r\n\r\n Am I right? How I wish that our clerical guides\r\n Would settle this question--and others besides!\r\n For always to harden one's fiddlestrings thus,\r\n If it's wholesome for beggars, is hurtful for us.\r\n\r\n A few minutes later--how pleasant for me!--\r\n I am seated by Sophy at five-o'clock tea:\r\n Her table is loaded, for when a girl marries,\r\n What cartloads of rubbish they send her from _Barry's_!\r\n\r\n \"There's a present for you!\" Yes, my sweet Sophy's thrift\r\n Has enabled the darling to buy me a gift.\r\n And she slips in my hand--the delightfully sly Thing--\r\n A paper-weight formed of a bronze lizard writhing.\r\n\r\n \"What a charming _cadeau_! and,\" says I, \"so well made;\r\n But are you aware, you extravagant jade,\r\n That in casting this metal a live, harmless lizard\r\n Was cruelly tortured in ghost and in gizzard?\"\r\n\r\n \"Pooh, pooh,\" says my lady (I ought to defend her,\r\n Her head is too giddy, her heart's much too tender),\r\n \"Hopgarten protests they've no feeling--and so\r\n It was nothing but muscular movement, you know.\"\r\n\r\n Thinks I--when I've said _au revoir_, and depart--\r\n (A Comb in my pocket, a Weight at my heart),--\r\n And when wretched mendicants writhe, we've a notion\r\n That begging is only a muscular motion.\r\n\nThe Angora Cat\r\n\n Good pastry is vended\r\n In Cite Fadette,--\r\n Madame Pons constructs splendid\r\n _Brioche_ and _galette_!\r\n\r\n Monsieur Pons is so fat that\r\n He's laid on the shelf,--\r\n Madame Pons had a cat that\r\n Was fat as herself.\r\n\r\n Long hair--soft as satin,--\r\n A musical purr--\r\n 'Gainst the window she'd flatten\r\n Her delicate fur.\r\n\r\n Once I drove Lou to see what\r\n Our neighbours were at,\r\n When, in rapture, cried she, \"What\r\n An exquisite cat!\r\n\r\n \"What whiskers! She's purring\r\n All over. A gale\r\n Of contentment is stirring\r\n Her feathery tail.\r\n\r\n \"Monsieur Pons, will you sell her?\"--\r\n \"_Ma femme est sortie_,\r\n Your offer I'll tell her,\r\n But--will she?\" says he.\r\n\r\n Yet Pons was persuaded\r\n To part with the prize!\r\n (Our bargain was aided,\r\n My Lou, by your eyes!)\r\n\r\n From his _legitime_ save him--\r\n My fate I prefer!\r\n For I warrant she gave him\r\n _Un mauvais quart d'heure_.\r\n\r\n I'm giving a pleasant\r\n Grimalkin to Lou,\r\n --Ah, Puss, what a present\r\n I'm giving to you!\r\n\nON A PORTRAIT OF DR. LAURENCE STERNE,\r\n\r\n BY SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS.\r\n\n When Punch gives friend and foe their due,\r\n Can unwashed mirth grow riper?\r\n Yet when the curtain falls, how few\r\n Remain to pay the piper!\r\n\r\n If pathos should thy bosom stir\r\n To tears, more sweet than laughter,\r\n Oh, bless its kind interpreter,\r\n And love him ever after!\r\n\r\n Dear Parson of the roguish eye!\r\n Thy face has grown historic,\r\n Since saint and sinner flocked to buy\r\n The homilies of Yorick.\r\n\r\n I fain would add one blossom to\r\n The chaplet Fame has wreathed thee.\r\n My friends, the crew that Yorick drew\r\n Accept, as friends bequeathed thee.\r\n\r\n At Shandy Hall I like to stop\r\n And see my ancient crony,\r\n Or in the lane meet Dr. Slop\r\n Astride a slender pony.\r\n\r\n Mine uncle, on his bowling-green,\r\n Still storms a breach in Flanders;\r\n And faithful Trim, starch, tall, and lean,\r\n With Bridget still philanders.\r\n\r\n And here again they visit us\r\n By happy inspiration,\r\n The \"fortunes of Pisistratus,\"\r\n A tale of fascination.\r\n\r\n But lay his magic volume by,\r\n And thank the Great Enchanter;--\r\n Our loins are girded, let us try\r\n A sentimental canter....\r\n\r\n A Temple quaint of latest growth\r\n Expands, where Art and Science\r\n Astounded by our lack of both,\r\n Have founded an alliance.\r\n\r\n One picture there all passers scan,\r\n It rivets friend and stranger:\r\n Come, gaze on yonder guileless man,\r\n And tremble for his danger.\r\n\r\n Mine uncle's bluff--his waistcoat's buff,--\r\n The heart beneath is tender.--\r\n Bewitching widow! Hold! Enough!\r\n Thou fairest of thy gender.\r\n\r\n The limner's art!--the poet's pen!--\r\n Posterity the story\r\n Shall tell how these three gifted men\r\n Have wrought for Yorick's glory.\r\n\r\n O name not easily forgot!\r\n Our love, dear Shade, we show thee,\r\n Regretting thy misdeeds, but not\r\n Forgetting what we owe thee.\r\n\nA SKETCH IN SEVEN DIALS.\r\n\n Minnie, in her hand a sixpence,\r\n Toddled off to buy some butter;\r\n (Minnie's pinafore was spotless)\r\n Back she brought it to the gutter,\r\n Gleeful, radiant, as she thus did,\r\n Proud to be so largely trusted.\r\n\r\n One, two, three small steps she'd taken,\r\n Blissfully came little Minnie,\r\n When, poor darling! down she tumbled,\r\n Daubed her hands and face and pinny!\r\n Dropping too, the little slut, her\r\n Pat of butter in the gutter.\r\n\r\n Never creep back so despairing--\r\n Dry those eyes, my little fairy:\r\n All of us start off in high glee,\r\n Many come back quite _contrairy_.\r\n I've mourned sixpences in scores too,\r\n Damaged hopes and pinafores too.\r\n\nLITTLE PITCHER.\r\n\r\n (A BIRTHDAY ODE.)\r\n\n The Muses, those painstaking Mentors of mine,\r\n Observe that to-day Little Pitcher is nine!\r\n 'Tis her _fete_--so, although retrospection is pleasant,\r\n While we muse on her Past, we must think of her Present.\r\n\r\n A Gift!--In their praise she has raved, sung, and written,\r\n Still, I don't seem to care for pup, pony, or kitten;\r\n Though their virtues I've heard Little Pitcher extol:\r\n She's too old for a watch, and too young for a doll!\r\n\r\n Of a worthless old Block she's the dearest of Chips,\r\n For what nonsense she talks when she opens her lips.\r\n Then her mouth--when she's happy--indeed, it appears\r\n To laugh at the tips of her comical EARS.\r\n\r\n Her Ears,--Ah, her Ears!--I remember the squallings\r\n That greeted my own ears, when Rambert and\r\n Lawlings Were boring (as I do) her Organs of Hearing--\r\n Come, I'll give her for each of those Organs an Earring.\r\n\r\n Here they are! They are formed of the two scarabaei\r\n That I bought of the old _contadino_ at Veii.\r\n They cost me some _pauls_, but, as history shows,\r\n For what runs through the Ears, we must pay through the Nose.\r\n\r\n And now, Little Pitcher, give ear to my rede,\r\n And guard these two gems with a scrupulous heed,\r\n\r\n For think of the woeful mishap that befel\r\n The damsel who dropt her pair into a well.\r\n\r\n That poor Little Pitcher would gladly have flown,\r\n Or given her Ears to have let well alone;\r\n For when she got home her Instructress severe\r\n Dismissed her to bed with a Flea in her Ear.\r\n\r\n What? Tell you that tale? Come, a tale with a sting\r\n Would be rather too much of an excellent thing!\r\n I can't point a moral--or sing you the song--\r\n My Years are too short--and your Ears are too long.\r\n\nUNFORTUNATE MISS BAILEY.\r\n\r\n (AN EXPERIMENT.)\r\n\n When he whispers, \"O Miss Bailey,\r\n Thou art brightest of the throng\"--\r\n She makes murmur, softly-gaily--\r\n \"Alfred, I have loved thee long.\"\r\n\r\n Then he drops upon his knees, a\r\n Proof his heart is soft as wax:\r\n She's--I don't know who, but he's a\r\n Captain bold from Halifax.\r\n\r\n Though so loving, such another\r\n Artless bride was never seen,\r\n Coachee thinks that she's his mother\r\n --Till they get to Gretna Green.\r\n\r\n There they stand, by him attended,\r\n Hear the sable smith rehearse\r\n That which links them, when 'tis ended,\r\n Tight for better--or for worse.\r\n\r\n Now her heart rejoices--ugly\r\n Troubles need disturb her less--\r\n Now the Happy Pair are snugly\r\n Seated in the night express.\r\n\r\n So they go with fond emotion,\r\n So they journey through the night--\r\n London is their land of Goshen--\r\n See, its suburbs are in sight!\r\n\r\n Hark! the sound of life is swelling,\r\n Pacing up, and racing down,\r\n Soon they reach her simple dwelling--\r\n Burley Street, by Somers Town.\r\n\r\n What is there to so astound them?\r\n She cries \"Oh!\" for he cries \"Hah!\"\r\n When five brats emerge, confound them!\r\n Shouting out, \"Mama!--PAPA!\"\r\n\r\n While at this he wonders blindly,\r\n Nor their meaning can divine,\r\n Proud she turns them round, and kindly,\r\n \"All of these are mine and thine!\"\r\n\r\n * * * * *\r\n\r\n Here he pines, and grows dyspeptic,\r\n Losing heart he loses pith--\r\n Hints that Bishop Tait's a sceptic--\r\n Swears that Moses was a myth.\r\n\r\n Sees no evidence in Paley--\r\n Takes to drinking ratifia:\r\n Shies the muffins at Miss Bailey\r\n While she's pouring out the tea.\r\n\r\n One day, knocking up his quarters,\r\n Poor Miss Bailey found him dead,\r\n Hanging in his knotted garters,\r\n Which she knitted ere they wed.\r\n\nADVICE TO A POET.\r\n\n Dear Poet, never rhyme at all!--\r\n But if you must, don't tell your neighbours;\r\n Or five in six, who cannot scrawl,\r\n Will dub you donkey for your labours.\r\n This epithet may seem unjust\r\n To you--or any verse-begetter:\r\n Oh, must we own--I fear we must!--\r\n That nine in ten deserve no better.\r\n\r\n Then let them bray with leathern lungs,\r\n And match you with the beast that grazes,--\r\n Or wag their heads, and hold their tongues,\r\n Or damn you with the faintest praises.\r\n Be patient--you will get your due\r\n Of honours, or humiliations:\r\n So look for sympathy--but do\r\n Not look to find it from relations.\r\n\r\n When strangers first approved my books\r\n My kindred marvelled what the praise meant,\r\n They now wear more respectful looks,\r\n But can't get over their amazement.\r\n Indeed, they've power to wound, beyond\r\n That wielded by the fiercest hater,\r\n For all the time they are so fond--\r\n Which makes the aggravation greater.\r\n\r\n Most warblers now but half express\r\n The threadbare thoughts they feebly utter:\r\n If they attempted nought--or less!\r\n They would not sink, and gasp, and flutter.\r\n Fly low, my friend, then mount, and win\r\n The niche, for which the town's contesting;\r\n And never mind your kith and kin--\r\n But never give them cause for jesting.\r\n\r\n A bard on entering the lists\r\n Should form his plan, and, having conn'd it,\r\n Should know wherein his strength consists,\r\n And never, never go beyond it.\r\n Great Dryden all pretence discards,\r\n Does Cowper ever strain his tether?\r\n And Praed--(Watteau of English Bards)--\r\n How well he keeps his team together!\r\n\r\n Hold Pegasus in hand--control\r\n A vein for ornament ensnaring,\r\n Simplicity is still the soul\r\n Of all that Time deems worth the sparing.\r\n Long lays are not a lively sport,\r\n Reduce your own to half a quarter,\r\n Unless your Public thinks them short,\r\n Posterity will cut them shorter.\r\n\r\n I look on Bards who whine for praise,\r\n With feelings of profoundest pity:\r\n They hunger for the Poets' bays\r\n And swear one's spiteful when one's witty.\r\n The critic's lot is passing hard--\r\n Between ourselves, I think reviewers,\r\n When called to truss a crowing bard,\r\n Should not be sparing of the skewers.\r\n\r\n We all--the foolish and the wise--\r\n Regard our verse with fascination,\r\n Through asinine paternal eyes,\r\n And hues of Fancy's own creation;\r\n Then pray, Sir, pray, excuse a queer\r\n And sadly self-deluded rhymer,\r\n Who thinks his beer (the smallest beer!)\r\n Has all the gust of _alt hochheimer_.\r\n\r\n Dear Bard, the Muse is such a minx,\r\n So tricksy, it were wrong to let her\r\n Rest satisfied with what she thinks\r\n Is perfect: try and teach her better.\r\n And if you only use, perchance,\r\n One half the pains to learn that we, Sir,\r\n Still use to hide our ignorance--\r\n How very clever you will be, Sir!\r\n\nNOTES.\r\n\nNOTE TO \"A HUMAN SKULL.\"\r\n\r\n\"In our last month's Magazine you may remember there were some verses\r\nabout a portion of a skeleton. Did you remark how the poet and present\r\nproprietor of the human skull at once settled the sex of it, and\r\ndetermined off-hand that it must have belonged to a woman? Such skulls\r\nare locked up in many gentlemen's hearts and memories. Bluebeard, you\r\nknow, had a whole museum of them--as that imprudent little last wife\r\nof his found out to her cost. And, on the other hand, a lady, we\r\nsuppose, would select hers of the sort which had carried beards when\r\nin the flesh.\"--_The Adventures of Philip on his Way through the\r\nWorld. Cornhill Magazine, January, 1861._\r\n\nNOTE TO \"AN INVITATION TO ROME.\"\r\n\r\n\"He never sends a letter to her, but he begins a new one on the same\r\nday. He can't bear to let go her kind little hand as it were. He knows\r\nthat she is thinking of him, and longing for him far away in Dublin\r\nyonder.\"--_English Humourists of the Eighteenth Century._\r\n\nNOTE TO \"TO MY MISTRESS.\"\r\n\r\n\"M. Deschanel quotes the following charming little poem, by Corneille,\r\naddressed to a young lady who had not been quite civil to him. He says\r\nwith truth--'Le sujet est leger, le rhythme court, mais on y retrouve\r\nla fierte de l'homme, et aussi l'ampleur du tragique.' The verses are\r\nprobably new to our readers. They are well worth reading:--\r\n\r\n Marquise, si mon visage\r\n A quelques traits un peu vieux,\r\n Souvenez-vous, qu'a mon age\r\n Vous ne vaudrez guere mieux.\r\n\r\n Le temps aux plus belles choses\r\n Se plait a faire un affront,\r\n Et saura faner vos roses\r\n Comme il a ride mon front.\r\n\r\n Le meme cours des planetes\r\n Regle nos jours et nos nuits;\r\n On m'a vu ce que vous etes,\r\n Vous serez ce que je suis.\r\n\r\n Cependant j'ai quelques charmes\r\n Qui sont assez eclatants\r\n Pour n'avoir pas trop d'alarmes\r\n De ces ravages du temps.\r\n\r\n Vous en avez qu'on adore,\r\n Mais ceux que vous meprisez\r\n Pourraient bien durer encore\r\n Quand ceux-la seront uses.\r\n\r\n Ils pourront sauver la gloire\r\n Des yeux qui me semblent doux,\r\n Et dans mille ans faire croire\r\n Ce qu'il me plaira de vous.\r\n\r\n Chez cette race nouvelle\r\n Ou j'aurai quelque credit,\r\n Vous ne passerez pour belle\r\n Qu'autant que je l'aurai dit.\r\n\r\n Pensez-y, belle Marquise,\r\n Quoiqu'un grison fasse effroi,\r\n Il vaut qu'on le courtise\r\n Quand il est fait comme moi.\r\n\r\nThe last four stanzas in particular are brimful of spirit, and the\r\nmixture of pride and vanity which they display is so remarkable that\r\nit seems impossible that it should have ever occurred in more than one\r\nperson.\"--_Saturday Review, July 23rd, 1864._\r\n\nNOTE TO \"THE ROSE AND THE RING.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Thackeray spent a portion of the winter of 1854 in Rome, and while\r\nthere he wrote his little Christmas story called \"The Rose and the\r\nRing.\" He was a great friend of the distinguished American sculptor,\r\nMr. Story, and was a frequent visitor at his house. I have heard Mr.\r\nStory speak with emotion of the kindness of Mr. Thackeray to his\r\nlittle daughter, then recovering from a severe illness, and he told me\r\nthat Mr. Thackeray used to come nearly every day to read to Miss\r\nStory, often bringing portions of his manuscript with him.\r\n\r\nFive or six years afterwards Miss Story showed me a very pretty copy\r\nof \"The Rose and the Ring,\" which Mr. Thackeray had sent her, with a\r\nfacetious sketch of himself in the act of presenting her with the\r\nwork.\r\n\nNOTE TO \"BERANGER.\"\r\n\r\n Jete sur cette boule,\r\n Laid, chetif, et souffrant;\r\n Etouffe dans la foule,\r\n Faute d'etre assez grand;\r\n\r\n Une plainte touchante\r\n De ma bouche sortit;\r\n Le bon Dieu me dit: Chante,\r\n Chante, pauvre petit!\r\n\r\n Chanter, ou je m'abuse,\r\n Est ma tache ici-bas.\r\n Tous ceux qu'ainsi j'amuse,\r\n Ne m'aimeront-ils pas?\r\n\nNOTE TO \"GLYCERE.\"\r\n\r\n _Un Vieillard._ Jeune fille au riant visage,\r\n Que cherches-tu sous cet ombrage?\r\n _La Jeune Fille._ Des fleurs pour orner mes cheveux.\r\n Je me rends au prochain village.\r\n Avec le printemps et ses feux,\r\n Bergeres, bergers amoureux\r\n Vont danser sur l'herbe nouvelle.\r\n Deja le sistre les appelle:\r\n Glycere est sans doute avec eux.\r\n De ces hameaux c'est la plus belle;\r\n Je veux l'effacer a leurs yeux:\r\n Voyez ces fleurs, c'est un presage.\r\n\r\n _Le Vieillard._ Sais-tu quel est ce lieu sauvage?\r\n\r\n _La Jeune Fille._ Non, et tout m'y semble nouveau.\r\n\r\n _Le Vieillard._ La repose, jeune etrangere,\r\n La plus belle de ce hameau.\r\n Ces fleurs pour effacer Glycere\r\n Tu les cueilles sur son tombeau!\r\n\r\n BERANGER.\r\n\n BRADBURY AND EVANS, PRINTERS, WHITEFRIARS."
