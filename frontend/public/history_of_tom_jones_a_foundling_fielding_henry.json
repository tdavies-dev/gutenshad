      "content": "Chapter the last -- In which the history is concluded.\r\n\nTo the Honourable\r\n\r\nGEORGE LYTTLETON, ESQ;\r\n\r\nOne of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding your constant refusal, when I have asked leave to\r\nprefix your name to this dedication, I must still insist on my right\r\nto desire your protection of this work.\r\n\r\nTo you, Sir, it is owing that this history was ever begun. It was by\r\nyour desire that I first thought of such a composition. So many years\r\nhave since past, that you may have, perhaps, forgotten this\r\ncircumstance: but your desires are to me in the nature of commands;\r\nand the impression of them is never to be erased from my memory.\r\n\r\nAgain, Sir, without your assistance this history had never been\r\ncompleted. Be not startled at the assertion. I do not intend to draw\r\non you the suspicion of being a romance writer. I mean no more than\r\nthat I partly owe to you my existence during great part of the time\r\nwhich I have employed in composing it: another matter which it may be\r\nnecessary to remind you of; since there are certain actions of which\r\nyou are apt to be extremely forgetful; but of these I hope I shall\r\nalways have a better memory than yourself.\r\n\r\nLastly, It is owing to you that the history appears what it now is. If\r\nthere be in this work, as some have been pleased to say, a stronger\r\npicture of a truly benevolent mind than is to be found in any other,\r\nwho that knows you, and a particular acquaintance of yours, will doubt\r\nwhence that benevolence hath been copied? The world will not, I\r\nbelieve, make me the compliment of thinking I took it from myself. I\r\ncare not: this they shall own, that the two persons from whom I have\r\ntaken it, that is to say, two of the best and worthiest men in the\r\nworld, are strongly and zealously my friends. I might be contented\r\nwith this, and yet my vanity will add a third to the number; and him\r\none of the greatest and noblest, not only in his rank, but in every\r\npublic and private virtue. But here, whilst my gratitude for the\r\nprincely benefactions of the Duke of Bedford bursts from my heart, you\r\nmust forgive my reminding you that it was you who first recommended me\r\nto the notice of my benefactor.\r\n\r\nAnd what are your objections to the allowance of the honour which I\r\nhave sollicited? Why, you have commended the book so warmly, that you\r\nshould be ashamed of reading your name before the dedication. Indeed,\r\nsir, if the book itself doth not make you ashamed of your\r\ncommendations, nothing that I can here write will, or ought. I am not\r\nto give up my right to your protection and patronage, because you have\r\ncommended my book: for though I acknowledge so many obligations to\r\nyou, I do not add this to the number; in which friendship, I am\r\nconvinced, hath so little share: since that can neither biass your\r\njudgment, nor pervert your integrity. An enemy may at any time obtain\r\nyour commendation by only deserving it; and the utmost which the\r\nfaults of your friends can hope for, is your silence; or, perhaps, if\r\ntoo severely accused, your gentle palliation.\r\n\r\nIn short, sir, I suspect, that your dislike of public praise is your\r\ntrue objection to granting my request. I have observed that you have,\r\nin common with my two other friends, an unwillingness to hear the\r\nleast mention of your own virtues; that, as a great poet says of one\r\nof you, (he might justly have said it of all three), you\r\n\r\n _Do good by stealth, and blush to find it fame_.\r\n\r\nIf men of this disposition are as careful to shun applause, as others\r\nare to escape censure, how just must be your apprehension of your\r\ncharacter falling into my hands; since what would not a man have\r\nreason to dread, if attacked by an author who had received from him\r\ninjuries equal to my obligations to you!\r\n\r\nAnd will not this dread of censure increase in proportion to the\r\nmatter which a man is conscious of having afforded for it? If his\r\nwhole life, for instance, should have been one continued subject of\r\nsatire, he may well tremble when an incensed satirist takes him in\r\nhand. Now, sir, if we apply this to your modest aversion to panegyric,\r\nhow reasonable will your fears of me appear!\r\n\r\nYet surely you might have gratified my ambition, from this single\r\nconfidence, that I shall always prefer the indulgence of your\r\ninclinations to the satisfaction of my own. A very strong instance of\r\nwhich I shall give you in this address, in which I am determined to\r\nfollow the example of all other dedicators, and will consider not what\r\nmy patron really deserves to have written, but what he will be best\r\npleased to read.\r\n\r\nWithout further preface then, I here present you with the labours of\r\nsome years of my life. What merit these labours have is already known\r\nto yourself. If, from your favourable judgment, I have conceived some\r\nesteem for them, it cannot be imputed to vanity; since I should have\r\nagreed as implicitly to your opinion, had it been given in favour of\r\nany other man's production. Negatively, at least, I may be allowed to\r\nsay, that had I been sensible of any great demerit in the work, you\r\nare the last person to whose protection I would have ventured to\r\nrecommend it.\r\n\r\nFrom the name of my patron, indeed, I hope my reader will be\r\nconvinced, at his very entrance on this work, that he will find in the\r\nwhole course of it nothing prejudicial to the cause of religion and\r\nvirtue, nothing inconsistent with the strictest rules of decency, nor\r\nwhich can offend even the chastest eye in the perusal. On the\r\ncontrary, I declare, that to recommend goodness and innocence hath\r\nbeen my sincere endeavour in this history. This honest purpose you\r\nhave been pleased to think I have attained: and to say the truth, it\r\nis likeliest to be attained in books of this kind; for an example is a\r\nkind of picture, in which virtue becomes, as it were, an object of\r\nsight, and strikes us with an idea of that loveliness, which Plato\r\nasserts there is in her naked charms.\r\n\r\nBesides displaying that beauty of virtue which may attract the\r\nadmiration of mankind, I have attempted to engage a stronger motive to\r\nhuman action in her favour, by convincing men, that their true\r\ninterest directs them to a pursuit of her. For this purpose I have\r\nshown that no acquisitions of guilt can compensate the loss of that\r\nsolid inward comfort of mind, which is the sure companion of innocence\r\nand virtue; nor can in the least balance the evil of that horror and\r\nanxiety which, in their room, guilt introduces into our bosoms. And\r\nagain, that as these acquisitions are in themselves generally\r\nworthless, so are the means to attain them not only base and infamous,\r\nbut at best incertain, and always full of danger. Lastly, I have\r\nendeavoured strongly to inculcate, that virtue and innocence can\r\nscarce ever be injured but by indiscretion; and that it is this alone\r\nwhich often betrays them into the snares that deceit and villainy\r\nspread for them. A moral which I have the more industriously laboured,\r\nas the teaching it is, of all others, the likeliest to be attended\r\nwith success; since, I believe, it is much easier to make good men\r\nwise, than to make bad men good.\r\n\r\nFor these purposes I have employed all the wit and humour of which I\r\nam master in the following history; wherein I have endeavoured to\r\nlaugh mankind out of their favourite follies and vices. How far I have\r\nsucceeded in this good attempt, I shall submit to the candid reader,\r\nwith only two requests: First, that he will not expect to find\r\nperfection in this work; and Secondly, that he will excuse some parts\r\nof it, if they fall short of that little merit which I hope may appear\r\nin others.\r\n\r\nI will detain you, sir, no longer. Indeed I have run into a preface,\r\nwhile I professed to write a dedication. But how can it be otherwise?\r\nI dare not praise you; and the only means I know of to avoid it, when\r\nyou are in my thoughts, are either to be entirely silent, or to turn\r\nmy thoughts to some other subject.\r\n\r\nPardon, therefore, what I have said in this epistle, not only without\r\nyour consent, but absolutely against it; and give me at least leave,\r\nin this public manner, to declare that I am, with the highest respect\r\nand gratitude,--\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYour most obliged,\r\n\r\nObedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nHENRY FIELDING.\r\n\nTHE HISTORY OF TOM JONES, A FOUNDLING.\r\n\nBOOK I.\r\n\r\nCONTAINING AS MUCH OF THE BIRTH OF THE FOUNDLING AS IS NECESSARY OR\r\nPROPER TO ACQUAINT THE READER WITH IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS HISTORY."

      "content": "The introduction to the work, or bill of fare to the feast.\r\n\nAn author ought to consider himself, not as a gentleman who gives a\r\nprivate or eleemosynary treat, but rather as one who keeps a public\r\nordinary, at which all persons are welcome for their money. In the\r\nformer case, it is well known that the entertainer provides what fare\r\nhe pleases; and though this should be very indifferent, and utterly\r\ndisagreeable to the taste of his company, they must not find any\r\nfault; nay, on the contrary, good breeding forces them outwardly to\r\napprove and to commend whatever is set before them. Now the contrary\r\nof this happens to the master of an ordinary. Men who pay for what\r\nthey eat will insist on gratifying their palates, however nice and\r\nwhimsical these may prove; and if everything is not agreeable to their\r\ntaste, will challenge a right to censure, to abuse, and to d--n their\r\ndinner without controul.\r\n\r\nTo prevent, therefore, giving offence to their customers by any such\r\ndisappointment, it hath been usual with the honest and well-meaning\r\nhost to provide a bill of fare which all persons may peruse at their\r\nfirst entrance into the house; and having thence acquainted themselves\r\nwith the entertainment which they may expect, may either stay and\r\nregale with what is provided for them, or may depart to some other\r\nordinary better accommodated to their taste.\r\n\r\nAs we do not disdain to borrow wit or wisdom from any man who is\r\ncapable of lending us either, we have condescended to take a hint from\r\nthese honest victuallers, and shall prefix not only a general bill of\r\nfare to our whole entertainment, but shall likewise give the reader\r\nparticular bills to every course which is to be served up in this and\r\nthe ensuing volumes.\r\n\r\nThe provision, then, which we have here made is no other than _Human\r\nNature_. Nor do I fear that my sensible reader, though most luxurious\r\nin his taste, will start, cavil, or be offended, because I have named\r\nbut one article. The tortoise--as the alderman of Bristol, well\r\nlearned in eating, knows by much experience--besides the delicious\r\ncalipash and calipee, contains many different kinds of food; nor can\r\nthe learned reader be ignorant, that in human nature, though here\r\ncollected under one general name, is such prodigious variety, that a\r\ncook will have sooner gone through all the several species of animal\r\nand vegetable food in the world, than an author will be able to\r\nexhaust so extensive a subject.\r\n\r\nAn objection may perhaps be apprehended from the more delicate, that\r\nthis dish is too common and vulgar; for what else is the subject of\r\nall the romances, novels, plays, and poems, with which the stalls\r\nabound? Many exquisite viands might be rejected by the epicure, if it\r\nwas a sufficient cause for his contemning of them as common and\r\nvulgar, that something was to be found in the most paltry alleys under\r\nthe same name. In reality, true nature is as difficult to be met with\r\nin authors, as the Bayonne ham, or Bologna sausage, is to be found in\r\nthe shops.\r\n\r\nBut the whole, to continue the same metaphor, consists in the cookery\r\nof the author; for, as Mr Pope tells us--\r\n\r\n “True wit is nature to advantage drest;\r\n What oft was thought, but ne'er so well exprest.”\r\n\r\nThe same animal which hath the honour to have some part of his flesh\r\neaten at the table of a duke, may perhaps be degraded in another part,\r\nand some of his limbs gibbeted, as it were, in the vilest stall in\r\ntown. Where, then, lies the difference between the food of the\r\nnobleman and the porter, if both are at dinner on the same ox or calf,\r\nbut in the seasoning, the dressing, the garnishing, and the setting\r\nforth? Hence the one provokes and incites the most languid appetite,\r\nand the other turns and palls that which is the sharpest and keenest.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, the excellence of the mental entertainment consists\r\nless in the subject than in the author's skill in well dressing it up.\r\nHow pleased, therefore, will the reader be to find that we have, in\r\nthe following work, adhered closely to one of the highest principles\r\nof the best cook which the present age, or perhaps that of\r\nHeliogabalus, hath produced. This great man, as is well known to all\r\nlovers of polite eating, begins at first by setting plain things\r\nbefore his hungry guests, rising afterwards by degrees as their\r\nstomachs may be supposed to decrease, to the very quintessence of\r\nsauce and spices. In like manner, we shall represent human nature at\r\nfirst to the keen appetite of our reader, in that more plain and\r\nsimple manner in which it is found in the country, and shall hereafter\r\nhash and ragoo it with all the high French and Italian seasoning of\r\naffectation and vice which courts and cities afford. By these means,\r\nwe doubt not but our reader may be rendered desirous to read on for\r\never, as the great person just above-mentioned is supposed to have\r\nmade some persons eat.\r\n\r\nHaving premised thus much, we will now detain those who like our bill\r\nof fare no longer from their diet, and shall proceed directly to serve\r\nup the first course of our history for their entertainment."

      "content": "A short description of squire Allworthy, and a fuller account of Miss\r\nBridget Allworthy, his sister.\r\n\nIn that part of the western division of this kingdom which is commonly\r\ncalled Somersetshire, there lately lived, and perhaps lives still, a\r\ngentleman whose name was Allworthy, and who might well be called the\r\nfavourite of both nature and fortune; for both of these seem to have\r\ncontended which should bless and enrich him most. In this contention,\r\nnature may seem to some to have come off victorious, as she bestowed\r\non him many gifts, while fortune had only one gift in her power; but\r\nin pouring forth this, she was so very profuse, that others perhaps\r\nmay think this single endowment to have been more than equivalent to\r\nall the various blessings which he enjoyed from nature. From the\r\nformer of these, he derived an agreeable person, a sound constitution,\r\na solid understanding, and a benevolent heart; by the latter, he was\r\ndecreed to the inheritance of one of the largest estates in the\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman had in his youth married a very worthy and beautiful\r\nwoman, of whom he had been extremely fond: by her he had three\r\nchildren, all of whom died in their infancy. He had likewise had the\r\nmisfortune of burying this beloved wife herself, about five years\r\nbefore the time in which this history chuses to set out. This loss,\r\nhowever great, he bore like a man of sense and constancy, though it\r\nmust be confest he would often talk a little whimsically on this head;\r\nfor he sometimes said he looked on himself as still married, and\r\nconsidered his wife as only gone a little before him, a journey which\r\nhe should most certainly, sooner or later, take after her; and that he\r\nhad not the least doubt of meeting her again in a place where he\r\nshould never part with her more--sentiments for which his sense was\r\narraigned by one part of his neighbours, his religion by a second, and\r\nhis sincerity by a third.\r\n\r\nHe now lived, for the most part, retired in the country, with one\r\nsister, for whom he had a very tender affection. This lady was now\r\nsomewhat past the age of thirty, an aera at which, in the opinion of\r\nthe malicious, the title of old maid may with no impropriety be\r\nassumed. She was of that species of women whom you commend rather for\r\ngood qualities than beauty, and who are generally called, by their own\r\nsex, very good sort of women--as good a sort of woman, madam, as you\r\nwould wish to know. Indeed, she was so far from regretting want of\r\nbeauty, that she never mentioned that perfection, if it can be called\r\none, without contempt; and would often thank God she was not as\r\nhandsome as Miss Such-a-one, whom perhaps beauty had led into errors\r\nwhich she might have otherwise avoided. Miss Bridget Allworthy (for\r\nthat was the name of this lady) very rightly conceived the charms of\r\nperson in a woman to be no better than snares for herself, as well as\r\nfor others; and yet so discreet was she in her conduct, that her\r\nprudence was as much on the guard as if she had all the snares to\r\napprehend which were ever laid for her whole sex. Indeed, I have\r\nobserved, though it may seem unaccountable to the reader, that this\r\nguard of prudence, like the trained bands, is always readiest to go on\r\nduty where there is the least danger. It often basely and cowardly\r\ndeserts those paragons for whom the men are all wishing, sighing,\r\ndying, and spreading every net in their power; and constantly attends\r\nat the heels of that higher order of women for whom the other sex have\r\na more distant and awful respect, and whom (from despair, I suppose,\r\nof success) they never venture to attack.\r\n\r\nReader, I think proper, before we proceed any farther together, to\r\nacquaint thee that I intend to digress, through this whole history, as\r\noften as I see occasion, of which I am myself a better judge than any\r\npitiful critic whatever; and here I must desire all those critics to\r\nmind their own business, and not to intermeddle with affairs or works\r\nwhich no ways concern them; for till they produce the authority by\r\nwhich they are constituted judges, I shall not plead to their\r\njurisdiction."

      "content": "An odd accident which befel Mr Allworthy at his return home. The\r\ndecent behaviour of Mrs Deborah Wilkins, with some proper\r\nanimadversions on bastards.\r\n\nI have told my reader, in the preceding chapter, that Mr Allworthy\r\ninherited a large fortune; that he had a good heart, and no family.\r\nHence, doubtless, it will be concluded by many that he lived like an\r\nhonest man, owed no one a shilling, took nothing but what was his own,\r\nkept a good house, entertained his neighbours with a hearty welcome at\r\nhis table, and was charitable to the poor, i.e. to those who had\r\nrather beg than work, by giving them the offals from it; that he died\r\nimmensely rich and built an hospital.\r\n\r\nAnd true it is that he did many of these things; but had he done\r\nnothing more I should have left him to have recorded his own merit on\r\nsome fair freestone over the door of that hospital. Matters of a much\r\nmore extraordinary kind are to be the subject of this history, or I\r\nshould grossly mis-spend my time in writing so voluminous a work; and\r\nyou, my sagacious friend, might with equal profit and pleasure travel\r\nthrough some pages which certain droll authors have been facetiously\r\npleased to call _The History of England_.\r\n\r\nMr Allworthy had been absent a full quarter of a year in London, on\r\nsome very particular business, though I know not what it was; but\r\njudge of its importance by its having detained him so long from home,\r\nwhence he had not been absent a month at a time during the space of\r\nmany years. He came to his house very late in the evening, and after a\r\nshort supper with his sister, retired much fatigued to his chamber.\r\nHere, having spent some minutes on his knees--a custom which he never\r\nbroke through on any account--he was preparing to step into bed, when,\r\nupon opening the cloathes, to his great surprize he beheld an infant,\r\nwrapt up in some coarse linen, in a sweet and profound sleep, between\r\nhis sheets. He stood some time lost in astonishment at this sight;\r\nbut, as good nature had always the ascendant in his mind, he soon\r\nbegan to be touched with sentiments of compassion for the little\r\nwretch before him. He then rang his bell, and ordered an elderly\r\nwoman-servant to rise immediately, and come to him; and in the\r\nmeantime was so eager in contemplating the beauty of innocence,\r\nappearing in those lively colours with which infancy and sleep always\r\ndisplay it, that his thoughts were too much engaged to reflect that he\r\nwas in his shirt when the matron came in. She had indeed given her\r\nmaster sufficient time to dress himself; for out of respect to him,\r\nand regard to decency, she had spent many minutes in adjusting her\r\nhair at the looking-glass, notwithstanding all the hurry in which she\r\nhad been summoned by the servant, and though her master, for aught she\r\nknew, lay expiring in an apoplexy, or in some other fit.\r\n\r\nIt will not be wondered at that a creature who had so strict a regard\r\nto decency in her own person, should be shocked at the least deviation\r\nfrom it in another. She therefore no sooner opened the door, and saw\r\nher master standing by the bedside in his shirt, with a candle in his\r\nhand, than she started back in a most terrible fright, and might\r\nperhaps have swooned away, had he not now recollected his being\r\nundrest, and put an end to her terrors by desiring her to stay without\r\nthe door till he had thrown some cloathes over his back, and was\r\nbecome incapable of shocking the pure eyes of Mrs Deborah Wilkins,\r\nwho, though in the fifty-second year of her age, vowed she had never\r\nbeheld a man without his coat. Sneerers and prophane wits may perhaps\r\nlaugh at her first fright; yet my graver reader, when he considers the\r\ntime of night, the summons from her bed, and the situation in which\r\nshe found her master, will highly justify and applaud her conduct,\r\nunless the prudence which must be supposed to attend maidens at that\r\nperiod of life at which Mrs Deborah had arrived, should a little\r\nlessen his admiration.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs Deborah returned into the room, and was acquainted by her\r\nmaster with the finding the little infant, her consternation was\r\nrather greater than his had been; nor could she refrain from crying\r\nout, with great horror of accent as well as look, “My good sir! what's\r\nto be done?” Mr Allworthy answered, she must take care of the child\r\nthat evening, and in the morning he would give orders to provide it a\r\nnurse. “Yes, sir,” says she; “and I hope your worship will send out\r\nyour warrant to take up the hussy its mother, for she must be one of\r\nthe neighbourhood; and I should be glad to see her committed to\r\nBridewell, and whipt at the cart's tail. Indeed, such wicked sluts\r\ncannot be too severely punished. I'll warrant 'tis not her first, by\r\nher impudence in laying it to your worship.” “In laying it to me,\r\nDeborah!” answered Allworthy: “I can't think she hath any such design.\r\nI suppose she hath only taken this method to provide for her child;\r\nand truly I am glad she hath not done worse.” “I don't know what is\r\nworse,” cries Deborah, “than for such wicked strumpets to lay their\r\nsins at honest men's doors; and though your worship knows your own\r\ninnocence, yet the world is censorious; and it hath been many an\r\nhonest man's hap to pass for the father of children he never begot;\r\nand if your worship should provide for the child, it may make the\r\npeople the apter to believe; besides, why should your worship provide\r\nfor what the parish is obliged to maintain? For my own part, if it was\r\nan honest man's child, indeed--but for my own part, it goes against me\r\nto touch these misbegotten wretches, whom I don't look upon as my\r\nfellow-creatures. Faugh! how it stinks! It doth not smell like a\r\nChristian. If I might be so bold to give my advice, I would have it\r\nput in a basket, and sent out and laid at the churchwarden's door. It\r\nis a good night, only a little rainy and windy; and if it was well\r\nwrapt up, and put in a warm basket, it is two to one but it lives till\r\nit is found in the morning. But if it should not, we have discharged\r\nour duty in taking proper care of it; and it is, perhaps, better for\r\nsuch creatures to die in a state of innocence, than to grow up and\r\nimitate their mothers; for nothing better can be expected of them.”\r\n\r\nThere were some strokes in this speech which perhaps would have\r\noffended Mr Allworthy, had he strictly attended to it; but he had now\r\ngot one of his fingers into the infant's hand, which, by its gentle\r\npressure, seeming to implore his assistance, had certainly out-pleaded\r\nthe eloquence of Mrs Deborah, had it been ten times greater than it\r\nwas. He now gave Mrs Deborah positive orders to take the child to her\r\nown bed, and to call up a maid-servant to provide it pap, and other\r\nthings, against it waked. He likewise ordered that proper cloathes\r\nshould be procured for it early in the morning, and that it should be\r\nbrought to himself as soon as he was stirring.\r\n\r\nSuch was the discernment of Mrs Wilkins, and such the respect she bore\r\nher master, under whom she enjoyed a most excellent place, that her\r\nscruples gave way to his peremptory commands; and she took the child\r\nunder her arms, without any apparent disgust at the illegality of its\r\nbirth; and declaring it was a sweet little infant, walked off with it\r\nto her own chamber.\r\n\r\nAllworthy here betook himself to those pleasing slumbers which a heart\r\nthat hungers after goodness is apt to enjoy when thoroughly satisfied.\r\nAs these are possibly sweeter than what are occasioned by any other\r\nhearty meal, I should take more pains to display them to the reader,\r\nif I knew any air to recommend him to for the procuring such an\r\nappetite."

      "content": "The reader's neck brought into danger by a description; his escape;\r\nand the great condescension of Miss Bridget Allworthy.\r\n\nThe Gothic stile of building could produce nothing nobler than Mr\r\nAllworthy's house. There was an air of grandeur in it that struck you\r\nwith awe, and rivalled the beauties of the best Grecian architecture;\r\nand it was as commodious within as venerable without.\r\n\r\nIt stood on the south-east side of a hill, but nearer the bottom than\r\nthe top of it, so as to be sheltered from the north-east by a grove of\r\nold oaks which rose above it in a gradual ascent of near half a mile,\r\nand yet high enough to enjoy a most charming prospect of the valley\r\nbeneath.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the grove was a fine lawn, sloping down towards the\r\nhouse, near the summit of which rose a plentiful spring, gushing out\r\nof a rock covered with firs, and forming a constant cascade of about\r\nthirty feet, not carried down a regular flight of steps, but tumbling\r\nin a natural fall over the broken and mossy stones till it came to the\r\nbottom of the rock, then running off in a pebly channel, that with\r\nmany lesser falls winded along, till it fell into a lake at the foot\r\nof the hill, about a quarter of a mile below the house on the south\r\nside, and which was seen from every room in the front. Out of this\r\nlake, which filled the center of a beautiful plain, embellished with\r\ngroups of beeches and elms, and fed with sheep, issued a river, that\r\nfor several miles was seen to meander through an amazing variety of\r\nmeadows and woods till it emptied itself into the sea, with a large\r\narm of which, and an island beyond it, the prospect was closed.\r\n\r\nOn the right of this valley opened another of less extent, adorned\r\nwith several villages, and terminated by one of the towers of an old\r\nruined abby, grown over with ivy, and part of the front, which\r\nremained still entire.\r\n\r\nThe left-hand scene presented the view of a very fine park, composed\r\nof very unequal ground, and agreeably varied with all the diversity\r\nthat hills, lawns, wood, and water, laid out with admirable taste, but\r\nowing less to art than to nature, could give. Beyond this, the country\r\ngradually rose into a ridge of wild mountains, the tops of which were\r\nabove the clouds.\r\n\r\nIt was now the middle of May, and the morning was remarkably serene,\r\nwhen Mr Allworthy walked forth on the terrace, where the dawn opened\r\nevery minute that lovely prospect we have before described to his eye;\r\nand now having sent forth streams of light, which ascended the blue\r\nfirmament before him, as harbingers preceding his pomp, in the full\r\nblaze of his majesty rose the sun, than which one object alone in this\r\nlower creation could be more glorious, and that Mr Allworthy himself\r\npresented--a human being replete with benevolence, meditating in what\r\nmanner he might render himself most acceptable to his Creator, by\r\ndoing most good to his creatures.\r\n\r\nReader, take care. I have unadvisedly led thee to the top of as high a\r\nhill as Mr Allworthy's, and how to get thee down without breaking thy\r\nneck, I do not well know. However, let us e'en venture to slide down\r\ntogether; for Miss Bridget rings her bell, and Mr Allworthy is\r\nsummoned to breakfast, where I must attend, and, if you please, shall\r\nbe glad of your company.\r\n\r\nThe usual compliments having past between Mr Allworthy and Miss\r\nBridget, and the tea being poured out, he summoned Mrs Wilkins, and\r\ntold his sister he had a present for her, for which she thanked\r\nhim--imagining, I suppose, it had been a gown, or some ornament for\r\nher person. Indeed, he very often made her such presents; and she, in\r\ncomplacence to him, spent much time in adorning herself. I say in\r\ncomplacence to him, because she always exprest the greatest contempt\r\nfor dress, and for those ladies who made it their study.\r\n\r\nBut if such was her expectation, how was she disappointed when Mrs\r\nWilkins, according to the order she had received from her master,\r\nproduced the little infant? Great surprizes, as hath been observed,\r\nare apt to be silent; and so was Miss Bridget, till her brother began,\r\nand told her the whole story, which, as the reader knows it already,\r\nwe shall not repeat.\r\n\r\nMiss Bridget had always exprest so great a regard for what the ladies\r\nare pleased to call virtue, and had herself maintained such a severity\r\nof character, that it was expected, especially by Wilkins, that she\r\nwould have vented much bitterness on this occasion, and would have\r\nvoted for sending the child, as a kind of noxious animal, immediately\r\nout of the house; but, on the contrary, she rather took the\r\ngood-natured side of the question, intimated some compassion for the\r\nhelpless little creature, and commended her brother's charity in what\r\nhe had done.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the reader may account for this behaviour from her\r\ncondescension to Mr Allworthy, when we have informed him that the good\r\nman had ended his narrative with owning a resolution to take care of\r\nthe child, and to breed him up as his own; for, to acknowledge the\r\ntruth, she was always ready to oblige her brother, and very seldom, if\r\never, contradicted his sentiments. She would, indeed, sometimes make a\r\nfew observations, as that men were headstrong, and must have their own\r\nway, and would wish she had been blest with an independent fortune;\r\nbut these were always vented in a low voice, and at the most amounted\r\nonly to what is called muttering.\r\n\r\nHowever, what she withheld from the infant, she bestowed with the\r\nutmost profuseness on the poor unknown mother, whom she called an\r\nimpudent slut, a wanton hussy, an audacious harlot, a wicked jade, a\r\nvile strumpet, with every other appellation with which the tongue of\r\nvirtue never fails to lash those who bring a disgrace on the sex.\r\n\r\nA consultation was now entered into how to proceed in order to\r\ndiscover the mother. A scrutiny was first made into the characters of\r\nthe female servants of the house, who were all acquitted by Mrs\r\nWilkins, and with apparent merit; for she had collected them herself,\r\nand perhaps it would be difficult to find such another set of\r\nscarecrows.\r\n\r\nThe next step was to examine among the inhabitants of the parish; and\r\nthis was referred to Mrs Wilkins, who was to enquire with all\r\nimaginable diligence, and to make her report in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nMatters being thus settled, Mr Allworthy withdrew to his study, as was\r\nhis custom, and left the child to his sister, who, at his desire, had\r\nundertaken the care of it."

      "content": "Containing a few common matters, with a very uncommon observation upon\r\nthem.\r\n\nWhen her master was departed, Mrs Deborah stood silent, expecting her\r\ncue from Miss Bridget; for as to what had past before her master, the\r\nprudent housekeeper by no means relied upon it, as she had often known\r\nthe sentiments of the lady in her brother's absence to differ greatly\r\nfrom those which she had expressed in his presence. Miss Bridget did\r\nnot, however, suffer her to continue long in this doubtful situation;\r\nfor having looked some time earnestly at the child, as it lay asleep\r\nin the lap of Mrs Deborah, the good lady could not forbear giving it a\r\nhearty kiss, at the same time declaring herself wonderfully pleased\r\nwith its beauty and innocence. Mrs Deborah no sooner observed this\r\nthan she fell to squeezing and kissing, with as great raptures as\r\nsometimes inspire the sage dame of forty and five towards a youthful\r\nand vigorous bridegroom, crying out, in a shrill voice, “O, the dear\r\nlittle creature!--The dear, sweet, pretty creature! Well, I vow it is\r\nas fine a boy as ever was seen!”\r\n\r\nThese exclamations continued till they were interrupted by the lady,\r\nwho now proceeded to execute the commission given her by her brother,\r\nand gave orders for providing all necessaries for the child,\r\nappointing a very good room in the house for his nursery. Her orders\r\nwere indeed so liberal, that, had it been a child of her own, she\r\ncould not have exceeded them; but, lest the virtuous reader may\r\ncondemn her for showing too great regard to a base-born infant, to\r\nwhich all charity is condemned by law as irreligious, we think proper\r\nto observe that she concluded the whole with saying, “Since it was her\r\nbrother's whim to adopt the little brat, she supposed little master\r\nmust be treated with great tenderness. For her part, she could not\r\nhelp thinking it was an encouragement to vice; but that she knew too\r\nmuch of the obstinacy of mankind to oppose any of their ridiculous\r\nhumours.”\r\n\r\nWith reflections of this nature she usually, as has been hinted,\r\naccompanied every act of compliance with her brother's inclinations;\r\nand surely nothing could more contribute to heighten the merit of this\r\ncompliance than a declaration that she knew, at the same time, the\r\nfolly and unreasonableness of those inclinations to which she\r\nsubmitted. Tacit obedience implies no force upon the will, and\r\nconsequently may be easily, and without any pains, preserved; but when\r\na wife, a child, a relation, or a friend, performs what we desire,\r\nwith grumbling and reluctance, with expressions of dislike and\r\ndissatisfaction, the manifest difficulty which they undergo must\r\ngreatly enhance the obligation.\r\n\r\nAs this is one of those deep observations which very few readers can\r\nbe supposed capable of making themselves, I have thought proper to\r\nlend them my assistance; but this is a favour rarely to be expected in\r\nthe course of my work. Indeed, I shall seldom or never so indulge him,\r\nunless in such instances as this, where nothing but the inspiration\r\nwith which we writers are gifted, can possibly enable any one to make\r\nthe discovery."

      "content": "Mrs Deborah is introduced into the parish with a simile. A short\r\naccount of Jenny Jones, with the difficulties and discouragements\r\nwhich may attend young women in the pursuit of learning.\r\n\nMrs Deborah, having disposed of the child according to the will of her\r\nmaster, now prepared to visit those habitations which were supposed to\r\nconceal its mother.\r\n\r\nNot otherwise than when a kite, tremendous bird, is beheld by the\r\nfeathered generation soaring aloft, and hovering over their heads, the\r\namorous dove, and every innocent little bird, spread wide the alarm,\r\nand fly trembling to their hiding-places. He proudly beats the air,\r\nconscious of his dignity, and meditates intended mischief.\r\n\r\nSo when the approach of Mrs Deborah was proclaimed through the street,\r\nall the inhabitants ran trembling into their houses, each matron\r\ndreading lest the visit should fall to her lot. She with stately steps\r\nproudly advances over the field: aloft she bears her towering head,\r\nfilled with conceit of her own pre-eminence, and schemes to effect her\r\nintended discovery.\r\n\r\nThe sagacious reader will not from this simile imagine these poor\r\npeople had any apprehension of the design with which Mrs Wilkins was\r\nnow coming towards them; but as the great beauty of the simile may\r\npossibly sleep these hundred years, till some future commentator shall\r\ntake this work in hand, I think proper to lend the reader a little\r\nassistance in this place.\r\n\r\nIt is my intention, therefore, to signify, that, as it is the nature\r\nof a kite to devour little birds, so is it the nature of such persons\r\nas Mrs Wilkins to insult and tyrannize over little people. This being\r\nindeed the means which they use to recompense to themselves their\r\nextreme servility and condescension to their superiors; for nothing\r\ncan be more reasonable, than that slaves and flatterers should exact\r\nthe same taxes on all below them, which they themselves pay to all\r\nabove them.\r\n\r\nWhenever Mrs Deborah had occasion to exert any extraordinary\r\ncondescension to Mrs Bridget, and by that means had a little soured\r\nher natural disposition, it was usual with her to walk forth among\r\nthese people, in order to refine her temper, by venting, and, as it\r\nwere, purging off all ill humours; on which account she was by no\r\nmeans a welcome visitant: to say the truth, she was universally\r\ndreaded and hated by them all.\r\n\r\nOn her arrival in this place, she went immediately to the habitation\r\nof an elderly matron; to whom, as this matron had the good fortune to\r\nresemble herself in the comeliness of her person, as well as in her\r\nage, she had generally been more favourable than to any of the rest.\r\nTo this woman she imparted what had happened, and the design upon\r\nwhich she was come thither that morning. These two began presently to\r\nscrutinize the characters of the several young girls who lived in any\r\nof those houses, and at last fixed their strongest suspicion on one\r\nJenny Jones, who, they both agreed, was the likeliest person to have\r\ncommitted this fact.\r\n\r\nThis Jenny Jones was no very comely girl, either in her face or\r\nperson; but nature had somewhat compensated the want of beauty with\r\nwhat is generally more esteemed by those ladies whose judgment is\r\narrived at years of perfect maturity, for she had given her a very\r\nuncommon share of understanding. This gift Jenny had a good deal\r\nimproved by erudition. She had lived several years a servant with a\r\nschoolmaster, who, discovering a great quickness of parts in the girl,\r\nand an extraordinary desire of learning--for every leisure hour she\r\nwas always found reading in the books of the scholars--had the\r\ngood-nature, or folly--just as the reader pleases to call it--to\r\ninstruct her so far, that she obtained a competent skill in the Latin\r\nlanguage, and was, perhaps, as good a scholar as most of the young men\r\nof quality of the age. This advantage, however, like most others of an\r\nextraordinary kind, was attended with some small inconveniences: for\r\nas it is not to be wondered at, that a young woman so well\r\naccomplished should have little relish for the society of those whom\r\nfortune had made her equals, but whom education had rendered so much\r\nher inferiors; so is it matter of no greater astonishment, that this\r\nsuperiority in Jenny, together with that behaviour which is its\r\ncertain consequence, should produce among the rest some little envy\r\nand ill-will towards her; and these had, perhaps, secretly burnt in\r\nthe bosoms of her neighbours ever since her return from her service.\r\n\r\nTheir envy did not, however, display itself openly, till poor Jenny,\r\nto the surprize of everybody, and to the vexation of all the young\r\nwomen in these parts, had publickly shone forth on a Sunday in a new\r\nsilk gown, with a laced cap, and other proper appendages to these.\r\n\r\nThe flame, which had before lain in embryo, now burst forth. Jenny\r\nhad, by her learning, increased her own pride, which none of her\r\nneighbours were kind enough to feed with the honour she seemed to\r\ndemand; and now, instead of respect and adoration, she gained nothing\r\nbut hatred and abuse by her finery. The whole parish declared she\r\ncould not come honestly by such things; and parents, instead of\r\nwishing their daughters the same, felicitated themselves that their\r\nchildren had them not.\r\n\r\nHence, perhaps, it was, that the good woman first mentioned the name\r\nof this poor girl to Mrs Wilkins; but there was another circumstance\r\nthat confirmed the latter in her suspicion; for Jenny had lately been\r\noften at Mr Allworthy's house. She had officiated as nurse to Miss\r\nBridget, in a violent fit of illness, and had sat up many nights with\r\nthat lady; besides which, she had been seen there the very day before\r\nMr Allworthy's return, by Mrs Wilkins herself, though that sagacious\r\nperson had not at first conceived any suspicion of her on that\r\naccount: for, as she herself said, “She had always esteemed Jenny as a\r\nvery sober girl (though indeed she knew very little of her), and had\r\nrather suspected some of those wanton trollops, who gave themselves\r\nairs, because, forsooth, they thought themselves handsome.”\r\n\r\nJenny was now summoned to appear in person before Mrs Deborah, which\r\nshe immediately did. When Mrs Deborah, putting on the gravity of a\r\njudge, with somewhat more than his austerity, began an oration with\r\nthe words, “You audacious strumpet!” in which she proceeded rather to\r\npass sentence on the prisoner than to accuse her.\r\n\r\nThough Mrs Deborah was fully satisfied of the guilt of Jenny, from the\r\nreasons above shewn, it is possible Mr Allworthy might have required\r\nsome stronger evidence to have convicted her; but she saved her\r\naccusers any such trouble, by freely confessing the whole fact with\r\nwhich she was charged.\r\n\r\nThis confession, though delivered rather in terms of contrition, as it\r\nappeared, did not at all mollify Mrs Deborah, who now pronounced a\r\nsecond judgment against her, in more opprobrious language than before;\r\nnor had it any better success with the bystanders, who were now grown\r\nvery numerous. Many of them cried out, “They thought what madam's silk\r\ngown would end in;” others spoke sarcastically of her learning. Not a\r\nsingle female was present but found some means of expressing her\r\nabhorrence of poor Jenny, who bore all very patiently, except the\r\nmalice of one woman, who reflected upon her person, and tossing up her\r\nnose, said, “The man must have a good stomach who would give silk\r\ngowns for such sort of trumpery!” Jenny replied to this with a\r\nbitterness which might have surprized a judicious person, who had\r\nobserved the tranquillity with which she bore all the affronts to her\r\nchastity; but her patience was perhaps tired out, for this is a virtue\r\nwhich is very apt to be fatigued by exercise.\r\n\r\nMrs Deborah having succeeded beyond her hopes in her inquiry, returned\r\nwith much triumph, and, at the appointed hour, made a faithful report\r\nto Mr Allworthy, who was much surprized at the relation; for he had\r\nheard of the extraordinary parts and improvements of this girl, whom\r\nhe intended to have given in marriage, together with a small living,\r\nto a neighbouring curate. His concern, therefore, on this occasion,\r\nwas at least equal to the satisfaction which appeared in Mrs Deborah,\r\nand to many readers may seem much more reasonable.\r\n\r\nMiss Bridget blessed herself, and said, “For her part, she should\r\nnever hereafter entertain a good opinion of any woman.” For Jenny\r\nbefore this had the happiness of being much in her good graces also.\r\n\r\nThe prudent housekeeper was again dispatched to bring the unhappy\r\nculprit before Mr Allworthy, in order, not as it was hoped by some,\r\nand expected by all, to be sent to the house of correction, but to\r\nreceive wholesome admonition and reproof; which those who relish that\r\nkind of instructive writing may peruse in the next chapter."

      "title": "Chapter vii.",
      "content": "Containing such grave matter, that the reader cannot laugh once\r\nthrough the whole chapter, unless peradventure he should laugh at the\r\nauthor.\r\n\nWhen Jenny appeared, Mr Allworthy took her into his study, and spoke\r\nto her as follows: “You know, child, it is in my power as a\r\nmagistrate, to punish you very rigorously for what you have done; and\r\nyou will, perhaps, be the more apt to fear I should execute that\r\npower, because you have in a manner laid your sins at my door.\r\n\r\n“But, perhaps, this is one reason which hath determined me to act in a\r\nmilder manner with you: for, as no private resentment should ever\r\ninfluence a magistrate, I will be so far from considering your having\r\ndeposited the infant in my house as an aggravation of your offence,\r\nthat I will suppose, in your favour, this to have proceeded from a\r\nnatural affection to your child, since you might have some hopes to\r\nsee it thus better provided for than was in the power of yourself, or\r\nits wicked father, to provide for it. I should indeed have been highly\r\noffended with you had you exposed the little wretch in the manner of\r\nsome inhuman mothers, who seem no less to have abandoned their\r\nhumanity, than to have parted with their chastity. It is the other\r\npart of your offence, therefore, upon which I intend to admonish you,\r\nI mean the violation of your chastity;--a crime, however lightly it\r\nmay be treated by debauched persons, very heinous in itself, and very\r\ndreadful in its consequences.\r\n\r\n“The heinous nature of this offence must be sufficiently apparent to\r\nevery Christian, inasmuch as it is committed in defiance of the laws\r\nof our religion, and of the express commands of Him who founded that\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\n“And here its consequences may well be argued to be dreadful; for what\r\ncan be more so, than to incur the divine displeasure, by the breach of\r\nthe divine commands; and that in an instance against which the highest\r\nvengeance is specifically denounced?\r\n\r\n“But these things, though too little, I am afraid, regarded, are so\r\nplain, that mankind, however they may want to be reminded, can never\r\nneed information on this head. A hint, therefore, to awaken your sense\r\nof this matter, shall suffice; for I would inspire you with\r\nrepentance, and not drive you to desperation.\r\n\r\n“There are other consequences, not indeed so dreadful or replete with\r\nhorror as this; and yet such, as, if attentively considered, must, one\r\nwould think, deter all of your sex at least from the commission of\r\nthis crime.\r\n\r\n“For by it you are rendered infamous, and driven, like lepers of old,\r\nout of society; at least, from the society of all but wicked and\r\nreprobate persons; for no others will associate with you.\r\n\r\n“If you have fortunes, you are hereby rendered incapable of enjoying\r\nthem; if you have none, you are disabled from acquiring any, nay\r\nalmost of procuring your sustenance; for no persons of character will\r\nreceive you into their houses. Thus you are often driven by necessity\r\nitself into a state of shame and misery, which unavoidably ends in the\r\ndestruction of both body and soul.\r\n\r\n“Can any pleasure compensate these evils? Can any temptation have\r\nsophistry and delusion strong enough to persuade you to so simple a\r\nbargain? Or can any carnal appetite so overpower your reason, or so\r\ntotally lay it asleep, as to prevent your flying with affright and\r\nterror from a crime which carries such punishment always with it?\r\n\r\n“How base and mean must that woman be, how void of that dignity of\r\nmind, and decent pride, without which we are not worthy the name of\r\nhuman creatures, who can bear to level herself with the lowest animal,\r\nand to sacrifice all that is great and noble in her, all her heavenly\r\npart, to an appetite which she hath in common with the vilest branch\r\nof the creation! For no woman, sure, will plead the passion of love\r\nfor an excuse. This would be to own herself the mere tool and bubble\r\nof the man. Love, however barbarously we may corrupt and pervert its\r\nmeaning, as it is a laudable, is a rational passion, and can never be\r\nviolent but when reciprocal; for though the Scripture bids us love our\r\nenemies, it means not with that fervent love which we naturally bear\r\ntowards our friends; much less that we should sacrifice to them our\r\nlives, and what ought to be dearer to us, our innocence. Now in what\r\nlight, but that of an enemy, can a reasonable woman regard the man who\r\nsolicits her to entail on herself all the misery I have described to\r\nyou, and who would purchase to himself a short, trivial, contemptible\r\npleasure, so greatly at her expense! For, by the laws of custom, the\r\nwhole shame, with all its dreadful consequences, falls intirely upon\r\nher. Can love, which always seeks the good of its object, attempt to\r\nbetray a woman into a bargain where she is so greatly to be the loser?\r\nIf such corrupter, therefore, should have the impudence to pretend a\r\nreal affection for her, ought not the woman to regard him not only as\r\nan enemy, but as the worst of all enemies, a false, designing,\r\ntreacherous, pretended friend, who intends not only to debauch her\r\nbody, but her understanding at the same time?”\r\n\r\nHere Jenny expressing great concern, Allworthy paused a moment, and\r\nthen proceeded: “I have talked thus to you, child, not to insult you\r\nfor what is past and irrevocable, but to caution and strengthen you\r\nfor the future. Nor should I have taken this trouble, but from some\r\nopinion of your good sense, notwithstanding the dreadful slip you have\r\nmade; and from some hopes of your hearty repentance, which are founded\r\non the openness and sincerity of your confession. If these do not\r\ndeceive me, I will take care to convey you from this scene of your\r\nshame, where you shall, by being unknown, avoid the punishment which,\r\nas I have said, is allotted to your crime in this world; and I hope,\r\nby repentance, you will avoid the much heavier sentence denounced\r\nagainst it in the other. Be a good girl the rest of your days, and\r\nwant shall be no motive to your going astray; and, believe me, there\r\nis more pleasure, even in this world, in an innocent and virtuous\r\nlife, than in one debauched and vicious.\r\n\r\n“As to your child, let no thoughts concerning it molest you; I will\r\nprovide for it in a better manner than you can ever hope. And now\r\nnothing remains but that you inform me who was the wicked man that\r\nseduced you; for my anger against him will be much greater than you\r\nhave experienced on this occasion.”\r\n\r\nJenny now lifted her eyes from the ground, and with a modest look and\r\ndecent voice thus began:--\r\n\r\n“To know you, sir, and not love your goodness, would be an argument of\r\ntotal want of sense or goodness in any one. In me it would amount to\r\nthe highest ingratitude, not to feel, in the most sensible manner, the\r\ngreat degree of goodness you have been pleased to exert on this\r\noccasion. As to my concern for what is past, I know you will spare my\r\nblushes the repetition. My future conduct will much better declare my\r\nsentiments than any professions I can now make. I beg leave to assure\r\nyou, sir, that I take your advice much kinder than your generous offer\r\nwith which you concluded it; for, as you are pleased to say, sir, it\r\nis an instance of your opinion of my understanding.”--Here her tears\r\nflowing apace, she stopped a few moments, and then proceeded\r\nthus:--“Indeed, sir, your kindness overcomes me; but I will endeavour\r\nto deserve this good opinion: for if I have the understanding you are\r\nso kindly pleased to allow me, such advice cannot be thrown away upon\r\nme. I thank you, sir, heartily, for your intended kindness to my poor\r\nhelpless child: he is innocent, and I hope will live to be grateful\r\nfor all the favours you shall show him. But now, sir, I must on my\r\nknees entreat you not to persist in asking me to declare the father of\r\nmy infant. I promise you faithfully you shall one day know; but I am\r\nunder the most solemn ties and engagements of honour, as well as the\r\nmost religious vows and protestations, to conceal his name at this\r\ntime. And I know you too well, to think you would desire I should\r\nsacrifice either my honour or my religion.”\r\n\r\nMr Allworthy, whom the least mention of those sacred words was\r\nsufficient to stagger, hesitated a moment before he replied, and then\r\ntold her, she had done wrong to enter into such engagements to a\r\nvillain; but since she had, he could not insist on her breaking them.\r\nHe said, it was not from a motive of vain curiosity he had inquired,\r\nbut in order to punish the fellow; at least, that he might not\r\nignorantly confer favours on the undeserving.\r\n\r\nAs to these points, Jenny satisfied him by the most solemn assurances,\r\nthat the man was entirely out of his reach; and was neither subject to\r\nhis power, nor in any probability of becoming an object of his\r\ngoodness.\r\n\r\nThe ingenuity of this behaviour had gained Jenny so much credit with\r\nthis worthy man, that he easily believed what she told him; for as she\r\nhad disdained to excuse herself by a lie, and had hazarded his further\r\ndispleasure in her present situation, rather than she would forfeit\r\nher honour or integrity by betraying another, he had but little\r\napprehensions that she would be guilty of falsehood towards himself.\r\n\r\nHe therefore dismissed her with assurances that he would very soon\r\nremove her out of the reach of that obloquy she had incurred;\r\nconcluding with some additional documents, in which he recommended\r\nrepentance, saying, “Consider, child, there is one still to reconcile\r\nyourself to, whose favour is of much greater importance to you than\r\nmine.”"

      "content": "A dialogue between Mesdames Bridget and Deborah; containing more\r\namusement, but less instruction, than the former.\r\n\nWhen Mr Allworthy had retired to his study with Jenny Jones, as hath\r\nbeen seen, Mrs Bridget, with the good housekeeper, had betaken\r\nthemselves to a post next adjoining to the said study; whence, through\r\nthe conveyance of a keyhole, they sucked in at their ears the\r\ninstructive lecture delivered by Mr Allworthy, together with the\r\nanswers of Jenny, and indeed every other particular which passed in\r\nthe last chapter.\r\n\r\nThis hole in her brother's study-door was indeed as well known to Mrs\r\nBridget, and had been as frequently applied to by her, as the famous\r\nhole in the wall was by Thisbe of old. This served to many good\r\npurposes. For by such means Mrs Bridget became often acquainted with\r\nher brother's inclinations, without giving him the trouble of\r\nrepeating them to her. It is true, some inconveniences attended this\r\nintercourse, and she had sometimes reason to cry out with Thisbe, in\r\nShakspeare, “O, wicked, wicked wall!” For as Mr Allworthy was a\r\njustice of peace, certain things occurred in examinations concerning\r\nbastards, and such like, which are apt to give great offence to the\r\nchaste ears of virgins, especially when they approach the age of\r\nforty, as was the case of Mrs Bridget. However, she had, on such\r\noccasions, the advantage of concealing her blushes from the eyes of\r\nmen; and _De non apparentibus, et non existentibus eadem est\r\nratio_--in English, “When a woman is not seen to blush, she doth not\r\nblush at all.”\r\n\r\nBoth the good women kept strict silence during the whole scene between\r\nMr Allworthy and the girl; but as soon as it was ended, and that\r\ngentleman was out of hearing, Mrs Deborah could not help exclaiming\r\nagainst the clemency of her master, and especially against his\r\nsuffering her to conceal the father of the child, which she swore she\r\nwould have out of her before the sun set.\r\n\r\nAt these words Mrs Bridget discomposed her features with a smile (a\r\nthing very unusual to her). Not that I would have my reader imagine,\r\nthat this was one of those wanton smiles which Homer would have you\r\nconceive came from Venus, when he calls her the laughter-loving\r\ngoddess; nor was it one of those smiles which Lady Seraphina shoots\r\nfrom the stage-box, and which Venus would quit her immortality to be\r\nable to equal. No, this was rather one of those smiles which might be\r\nsupposed to have come from the dimpled cheeks of the august Tisiphone,\r\nor from one of the misses, her sisters.\r\n\r\nWith such a smile then, and with a voice sweet as the evening breeze\r\nof Boreas in the pleasant month of November, Mrs Bridget gently\r\nreproved the curiosity of Mrs Deborah; a vice with which it seems the\r\nlatter was too much tainted, and which the former inveighed against\r\nwith great bitterness, adding, “That, among all her faults, she\r\nthanked Heaven her enemies could not accuse her of prying into the\r\naffairs of other people.”\r\n\r\nShe then proceeded to commend the honour and spirit with which Jenny\r\nhad acted. She said, she could not help agreeing with her brother,\r\nthat there was some merit in the sincerity of her confession, and in\r\nher integrity to her lover: that she had always thought her a very\r\ngood girl, and doubted not but she had been seduced by some rascal,\r\nwho had been infinitely more to blame than herself, and very probably\r\nhad prevailed with her by a promise of marriage, or some other\r\ntreacherous proceeding.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour of Mrs Bridget greatly surprised Mrs Deborah; for this\r\nwell-bred woman seldom opened her lips, either to her master or his\r\nsister, till she had first sounded their inclinations, with which her\r\nsentiments were always consonant. Here, however, she thought she might\r\nhave launched forth with safety; and the sagacious reader will not\r\nperhaps accuse her of want of sufficient forecast in so doing, but\r\nwill rather admire with what wonderful celerity she tacked about, when\r\nshe found herself steering a wrong course.\r\n\r\n“Nay, madam,” said this able woman, and truly great politician, “I\r\nmust own I cannot help admiring the girl's spirit, as well as your\r\nladyship. And, as your ladyship says, if she was deceived by some\r\nwicked man, the poor wretch is to be pitied. And to be sure, as your\r\nladyship says, the girl hath always appeared like a good, honest,\r\nplain girl, and not vain of her face, forsooth, as some wanton husseys\r\nin the neighbourhood are.”\r\n\r\n“You say true, Deborah,” said Miss Bridget. “If the girl had been one\r\nof those vain trollops, of which we have too many in the parish, I\r\nshould have condemned my brother for his lenity towards her. I saw two\r\nfarmers' daughters at church, the other day, with bare necks. I\r\nprotest they shocked me. If wenches will hang out lures for fellows,\r\nit is no matter what they suffer. I detest such creatures; and it\r\nwould be much better for them that their faces had been seamed with\r\nthe smallpox; but I must confess, I never saw any of this wanton\r\nbehaviour in poor Jenny: some artful villain, I am convinced, hath\r\nbetrayed, nay perhaps forced her; and I pity the poor wretch with all\r\nmy heart.”\r\n\r\nMrs Deborah approved all these sentiments, and the dialogue concluded\r\nwith a general and bitter invective against beauty, and with many\r\ncompassionate considerations for all honest plain girls who are\r\ndeluded by the wicked arts of deceitful men."

      "content": "Containing matters which will surprize the reader.\r\n\nJenny returned home well pleased with the reception she had met with\r\nfrom Mr Allworthy, whose indulgence to her she industriously made\r\npublic; partly perhaps as a sacrifice to her own pride, and partly\r\nfrom the more prudent motive of reconciling her neighbours to her, and\r\nsilencing their clamours.\r\n\r\nBut though this latter view, if she indeed had it, may appear\r\nreasonable enough, yet the event did not answer her expectation; for\r\nwhen she was convened before the justice, and it was universally\r\napprehended that the house of correction would have been her fate,\r\nthough some of the young women cryed out “It was good enough for her,”\r\n and diverted themselves with the thoughts of her beating hemp in a\r\nsilk gown; yet there were many others who began to pity her condition:\r\nbut when it was known in what manner Mr Allworthy had behaved, the\r\ntide turned against her. One said, “I'll assure you, madam hath had\r\ngood luck.” A second cryed, “See what it is to be a favourite!” A\r\nthird, “Ay, this comes of her learning.” Every person made some\r\nmalicious comment or other on the occasion, and reflected on the\r\npartiality of the justice.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of these people may appear impolitic and ungrateful to\r\nthe reader, who considers the power and benevolence of Mr Allworthy.\r\nBut as to his power, he never used it; and as to his benevolence, he\r\nexerted so much, that he had thereby disobliged all his neighbours;\r\nfor it is a secret well known to great men, that, by conferring an\r\nobligation, they do not always procure a friend, but are certain of\r\ncreating many enemies.\r\n\r\nJenny was, however, by the care and goodness of Mr Allworthy, soon\r\nremoved out of the reach of reproach; when malice being no longer able\r\nto vent its rage on her, began to seek another object of its\r\nbitterness, and this was no less than Mr Allworthy, himself; for a\r\nwhisper soon went abroad, that he himself was the father of the\r\nfoundling child.\r\n\r\nThis supposition so well reconciled his conduct to the general\r\nopinion, that it met with universal assent; and the outcry against his\r\nlenity soon began to take another turn, and was changed into an\r\ninvective against his cruelty to the poor girl. Very grave and good\r\nwomen exclaimed against men who begot children, and then disowned\r\nthem. Nor were there wanting some, who, after the departure of Jenny,\r\ninsinuated that she was spirited away with a design too black to be\r\nmentioned, and who gave frequent hints that a legal inquiry ought to\r\nbe made into the whole matter, and that some people should be forced\r\nto produce the girl.\r\n\r\nThese calumnies might have probably produced ill consequences, at the\r\nleast might have occasioned some trouble, to a person of a more\r\ndoubtful and suspicious character than Mr Allworthy was blessed with;\r\nbut in his case they had no such effect; and, being heartily despised\r\nby him, they served only to afford an innocent amusement to the good\r\ngossips of the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nBut as we cannot possibly divine what complection our reader may be\r\nof, and as it will be some time before he will hear any more of Jenny,\r\nwe think proper to give him a very early intimation, that Mr Allworthy\r\nwas, and will hereafter appear to be, absolutely innocent of any\r\ncriminal intention whatever. He had indeed committed no other than an\r\nerror in politics, by tempering justice with mercy, and by refusing to\r\ngratify the good-natured disposition of the mob,[*] with an object for\r\ntheir compassion to work on in the person of poor Jenny, whom, in\r\norder to pity, they desired to have seen sacrificed to ruin and\r\ninfamy, by a shameful correction in Bridewell.\r\n\r\n [*]Whenever this word occurs in our writings, it intends persons\r\n without virtue or sense, in all stations; and many of the highest\r\n rank are often meant by it.\r\n\r\nSo far from complying with this their inclination, by which all hopes\r\nof reformation would have been abolished, and even the gate shut\r\nagainst her if her own inclinations should ever hereafter lead her to\r\nchuse the road of virtue, Mr Allworthy rather chose to encourage the\r\ngirl to return thither by the only possible means; for too true I am\r\nafraid it is, that many women have become abandoned, and have sunk to\r\nthe last degree of vice, by being unable to retrieve the first slip.\r\nThis will be, I am afraid, always the case while they remain among\r\ntheir former acquaintance; it was therefore wisely done by Mr\r\nAllworthy, to remove Jenny to a place where she might enjoy the\r\npleasure of reputation, after having tasted the ill consequences of\r\nlosing it.\r\n\r\nTo this place therefore, wherever it was, we will wish her a good\r\njourney, and for the present take leave of her, and of the little\r\nfoundling her child, having matters of much higher importance to\r\ncommunicate to the reader."

      "content": "The hospitality of Allworthy; with a short sketch of the characters of\r\ntwo brothers, a doctor and a captain, who were entertained by that\r\ngentleman.\r\n\nNeither Mr Allworthy's house, nor his heart, were shut against any\r\npart of mankind, but they were both more particularly open to men of\r\nmerit. To say the truth, this was the only house in the kingdom where\r\nyou was sure to gain a dinner by deserving it.\r\n\r\nAbove all others, men of genius and learning shared the principal\r\nplace in his favour; and in these he had much discernment: for though\r\nhe had missed the advantage of a learned education, yet, being blest\r\nwith vast natural abilities, he had so well profited by a vigorous\r\nthough late application to letters, and by much conversation with men\r\nof eminence in this way, that he was himself a very competent judge in\r\nmost kinds of literature.\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder that in an age when this kind of merit is so little in\r\nfashion, and so slenderly provided for, persons possessed of it should\r\nvery eagerly flock to a place where they were sure of being received\r\nwith great complaisance; indeed, where they might enjoy almost the\r\nsame advantages of a liberal fortune as if they were entitled to it in\r\ntheir own right; for Mr Allworthy was not one of those generous\r\npersons who are ready most bountifully to bestow meat, drink, and\r\nlodging on men of wit and learning, for which they expect no other\r\nreturn but entertainment, instruction, flattery, and subserviency; in\r\na word, that such persons should be enrolled in the number of\r\ndomestics, without wearing their master's cloathes, or receiving\r\nwages.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, every person in this house was perfect master of his\r\nown time: and as he might at his pleasure satisfy all his appetites\r\nwithin the restrictions only of law, virtue, and religion; so he\r\nmight, if his health required, or his inclination prompted him to\r\ntemperance, or even to abstinence, absent himself from any meals, or\r\nretire from them, whenever he was so disposed, without even a\r\nsollicitation to the contrary: for, indeed, such sollicitations from\r\nsuperiors always savour very strongly of commands. But all here were\r\nfree from such impertinence, not only those whose company is in all\r\nother places esteemed a favour from their equality of fortune, but\r\neven those whose indigent circumstances make such an eleemosynary\r\nabode convenient to them, and who are therefore less welcome to a\r\ngreat man's table because they stand in need of it.\r\n\r\nAmong others of this kind was Dr Blifil, a gentleman who had the\r\nmisfortune of losing the advantage of great talents by the obstinacy\r\nof a father, who would breed him to a profession he disliked. In\r\nobedience to this obstinacy the doctor had in his youth been obliged\r\nto study physic, or rather to say he studied it; for in reality books\r\nof this kind were almost the only ones with which he was unacquainted;\r\nand unfortunately for him, the doctor was master of almost every other\r\nscience but that by which he was to get his bread; the consequence of\r\nwhich was, that the doctor at the age of forty had no bread to eat.\r\n\r\nSuch a person as this was certain to find a welcome at Mr Allworthy's\r\ntable, to whom misfortunes were ever a recommendation, when they were\r\nderived from the folly or villany of others, and not of the\r\nunfortunate person himself. Besides this negative merit, the doctor\r\nhad one positive recommendation;--this was a great appearance of\r\nreligion. Whether his religion was real, or consisted only in\r\nappearance, I shall not presume to say, as I am not possessed of any\r\ntouchstone which can distinguish the true from the false.\r\n\r\nIf this part of his character pleased Mr Allworthy, it delighted Miss\r\nBridget. She engaged him in many religious controversies; on which\r\noccasions she constantly expressed great satisfaction in the doctor's\r\nknowledge, and not much less in the compliments which he frequently\r\nbestowed on her own. To say the truth, she had read much English\r\ndivinity, and had puzzled more than one of the neighbouring curates.\r\nIndeed, her conversation was so pure, her looks so sage, and her whole\r\ndeportment so grave and solemn, that she seemed to deserve the name of\r\nsaint equally with her namesake, or with any other female in the Roman\r\nkalendar.\r\n\r\nAs sympathies of all kinds are apt to beget love, so experience\r\nteaches us that none have a more direct tendency this way than those\r\nof a religious kind between persons of different sexes. The doctor\r\nfound himself so agreeable to Miss Bridget, that he now began to\r\nlament an unfortunate accident which had happened to him about ten\r\nyears before; namely, his marriage with another woman, who was not\r\nonly still alive, but, what was worse, known to be so by Mr Allworthy.\r\nThis was a fatal bar to that happiness which he otherwise saw\r\nsufficient probability of obtaining with this young lady; for as to\r\ncriminal indulgences, he certainly never thought of them. This was\r\nowing either to his religion, as is most probable, or to the purity of\r\nhis passion, which was fixed on those things which matrimony only, and\r\nnot criminal correspondence, could put him in possession of, or could\r\ngive him any title to.\r\n\r\nHe had not long ruminated on these matters, before it occurred to his\r\nmemory that he had a brother who was under no such unhappy incapacity.\r\nThis brother he made no doubt would succeed; for he discerned, as he\r\nthought, an inclination to marriage in the lady; and the reader\r\nperhaps, when he hears the brother's qualifications, will not blame\r\nthe confidence which he entertained of his success.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman was about thirty-five years of age. He was of a middle\r\nsize, and what is called well-built. He had a scar on his forehead,\r\nwhich did not so much injure his beauty as it denoted his valour (for\r\nhe was a half-pay officer). He had good teeth, and something affable,\r\nwhen he pleased, in his smile; though naturally his countenance, as\r\nwell as his air and voice, had much of roughness in it: yet he could\r\nat any time deposit this, and appear all gentleness and good-humour.\r\nHe was not ungenteel, nor entirely devoid of wit, and in his youth had\r\nabounded in sprightliness, which, though he had lately put on a more\r\nserious character, he could, when he pleased, resume.\r\n\r\nHe had, as well as the doctor, an academic education; for his father\r\nhad, with the same paternal authority we have mentioned before,\r\ndecreed him for holy orders; but as the old gentleman died before he\r\nwas ordained, he chose the church military, and preferred the king's\r\ncommission to the bishop's.\r\n\r\nHe had purchased the post of lieutenant of dragoons, and afterwards\r\ncame to be a captain; but having quarrelled with his colonel, was by\r\nhis interest obliged to sell; from which time he had entirely\r\nrusticated himself, had betaken himself to studying the Scriptures,\r\nand was not a little suspected of an inclination to methodism.\r\n\r\nIt seemed, therefore, not unlikely that such a person should succeed\r\nwith a lady of so saint-like a disposition, and whose inclinations\r\nwere no otherwise engaged than to the marriage state in general; but\r\nwhy the doctor, who certainly had no great friendship for his brother,\r\nshould for his sake think of making so ill a return to the hospitality\r\nof Allworthy, is a matter not so easy to be accounted for.\r\n\r\nIs it that some natures delight in evil, as others are thought to\r\ndelight in virtue? Or is there a pleasure in being accessory to a\r\ntheft when we cannot commit it ourselves? Or lastly (which experience\r\nseems to make probable), have we a satisfaction in aggrandizing our\r\nfamilies, even though we have not the least love or respect for them?\r\n\r\nWhether any of these motives operated on the doctor, we will not\r\ndetermine; but so the fact was. He sent for his brother, and easily\r\nfound means to introduce him at Allworthy's as a person who intended\r\nonly a short visit to himself.\r\n\r\nThe captain had not been in the house a week before the doctor had\r\nreason to felicitate himself on his discernment. The captain was\r\nindeed as great a master of the art of love as Ovid was formerly. He\r\nhad besides received proper hints from his brother, which he failed\r\nnot to improve to the best advantage."

      "content": "Containing many rules, and some examples, concerning falling in love:\r\ndescriptions of beauty, and other more prudential inducements to\r\nmatrimony.\r\n\nIt hath been observed, by wise men or women, I forget which, that all\r\npersons are doomed to be in love once in their lives. No particular\r\nseason is, as I remember, assigned for this; but the age at which Miss\r\nBridget was arrived, seems to me as proper a period as any to be fixed\r\non for this purpose: it often, indeed, happens much earlier; but when\r\nit doth not, I have observed it seldom or never fails about this time.\r\nMoreover, we may remark that at this season love is of a more serious\r\nand steady nature than what sometimes shows itself in the younger\r\nparts of life. The love of girls is uncertain, capricious, and so\r\nfoolish that we cannot always discover what the young lady would be\r\nat; nay, it may almost be doubted whether she always knows this\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nNow we are never at a loss to discern this in women about forty; for\r\nas such grave, serious, and experienced ladies well know their own\r\nmeaning, so it is always very easy for a man of the least sagacity to\r\ndiscover it with the utmost certainty.\r\n\r\nMiss Bridget is an example of all these observations. She had not been\r\nmany times in the captain's company before she was seized with this\r\npassion. Nor did she go pining and moping about the house, like a\r\npuny, foolish girl, ignorant of her distemper: she felt, she knew, and\r\nshe enjoyed, the pleasing sensation, of which, as she was certain it\r\nwas not only innocent but laudable, she was neither afraid nor\r\nashamed.\r\n\r\nAnd to say the truth, there is, in all points, great difference\r\nbetween the reasonable passion which women at this age conceive\r\ntowards men, and the idle and childish liking of a girl to a boy,\r\nwhich is often fixed on the outside only, and on things of little\r\nvalue and no duration; as on cherry-cheeks, small, lily-white hands,\r\nsloe-black eyes, flowing locks, downy chins, dapper shapes; nay,\r\nsometimes on charms more worthless than these, and less the party's\r\nown; such are the outward ornaments of the person, for which men are\r\nbeholden to the taylor, the laceman, the periwig-maker, the hatter,\r\nand the milliner, and not to nature. Such a passion girls may well be\r\nashamed, as they generally are, to own either to themselves or others.\r\n\r\nThe love of Miss Bridget was of another kind. The captain owed nothing\r\nto any of these fop-makers in his dress, nor was his person much more\r\nbeholden to nature. Both his dress and person were such as, had they\r\nappeared in an assembly or a drawing-room, would have been the\r\ncontempt and ridicule of all the fine ladies there. The former of\r\nthese was indeed neat, but plain, coarse, ill-fancied, and out of\r\nfashion. As for the latter, we have expressly described it above. So\r\nfar was the skin on his cheeks from being cherry-coloured, that you\r\ncould not discern what the natural colour of his cheeks was, they\r\nbeing totally overgrown by a black beard, which ascended to his eyes.\r\nHis shape and limbs were indeed exactly proportioned, but so large\r\nthat they denoted the strength rather of a ploughman than any other.\r\nHis shoulders were broad beyond all size, and the calves of his legs\r\nlarger than those of a common chairman. In short, his whole person\r\nwanted all that elegance and beauty which is the very reverse of\r\nclumsy strength, and which so agreeably sets off most of our fine\r\ngentlemen; being partly owing to the high blood of their ancestors,\r\nviz., blood made of rich sauces and generous wines, and partly to an\r\nearly town education.\r\n\r\nThough Miss Bridget was a woman of the greatest delicacy of taste, yet\r\nsuch were the charms of the captain's conversation, that she totally\r\noverlooked the defects of his person. She imagined, and perhaps very\r\nwisely, that she should enjoy more agreeable minutes with the captain\r\nthan with a much prettier fellow; and forewent the consideration of\r\npleasing her eyes, in order to procure herself much more solid\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe captain no sooner perceived the passion of Miss Bridget, in which\r\ndiscovery he was very quick-sighted, than he faithfully returned it.\r\nThe lady, no more than her lover, was remarkable for beauty. I would\r\nattempt to draw her picture, but that is done already by a more able\r\nmaster, Mr Hogarth himself, to whom she sat many years ago, and hath\r\nbeen lately exhibited by that gentleman in his print of a winter's\r\nmorning, of which she was no improper emblem, and may be seen walking\r\n(for walk she doth in the print) to Covent Garden church, with a\r\nstarved foot-boy behind carrying her prayer-book.\r\n\r\nThe captain likewise very wisely preferred the more solid enjoyments\r\nhe expected with this lady, to the fleeting charms of person. He was\r\none of those wise men who regard beauty in the other sex as a very\r\nworthless and superficial qualification; or, to speak more truly, who\r\nrather chuse to possess every convenience of life with an ugly woman,\r\nthan a handsome one without any of those conveniences. And having a\r\nvery good appetite, and but little nicety, he fancied he should play\r\nhis part very well at the matrimonial banquet, without the sauce of\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nTo deal plainly with the reader, the captain, ever since his arrival,\r\nat least from the moment his brother had proposed the match to him,\r\nlong before he had discovered any flattering symptoms in Miss Bridget,\r\nhad been greatly enamoured; that is to say, of Mr Allworthy's house\r\nand gardens, and of his lands, tenements, and hereditaments; of all\r\nwhich the captain was so passionately fond, that he would most\r\nprobably have contracted marriage with them, had he been obliged to\r\nhave taken the witch of Endor into the bargain.\r\n\r\nAs Mr Allworthy, therefore, had declared to the doctor that he never\r\nintended to take a second wife, as his sister was his nearest\r\nrelation, and as the doctor had fished out that his intentions were to\r\nmake any child of hers his heir, which indeed the law, without his\r\ninterposition, would have done for him; the doctor and his brother\r\nthought it an act of benevolence to give being to a human creature,\r\nwho would be so plentifully provided with the most essential means of\r\nhappiness. The whole thoughts, therefore, of both the brothers were\r\nhow to engage the affections of this amiable lady.\r\n\r\nBut fortune, who is a tender parent, and often doth more for her\r\nfavourite offspring than either they deserve or wish, had been so\r\nindustrious for the captain, that whilst he was laying schemes to\r\nexecute his purpose, the lady conceived the same desires with himself,\r\nand was on her side contriving how to give the captain proper\r\nencouragement, without appearing too forward; for she was a strict\r\nobserver of all rules of decorum. In this, however, she easily\r\nsucceeded; for as the captain was always on the look-out, no glance,\r\ngesture, or word escaped him.\r\n\r\nThe satisfaction which the captain received from the kind behaviour of\r\nMiss Bridget, was not a little abated by his apprehensions of Mr\r\nAllworthy; for, notwithstanding his disinterested professions, the\r\ncaptain imagined he would, when he came to act, follow the example of\r\nthe rest of the world, and refuse his consent to a match so\r\ndisadvantageous, in point of interest, to his sister. From what oracle\r\nhe received this opinion, I shall leave the reader to determine: but\r\nhowever he came by it, it strangely perplexed him how to regulate his\r\nconduct so as at once to convey his affection to the lady, and to\r\nconceal it from her brother. He at length resolved to take all private\r\nopportunities of making his addresses; but in the presence of Mr\r\nAllworthy to be as reserved and as much upon his guard as was\r\npossible; and this conduct was highly approved by the brother.\r\n\r\nHe soon found means to make his addresses, in express terms, to his\r\nmistress, from whom he received an answer in the proper form, viz.:\r\nthe answer which was first made some thousands of years ago, and which\r\nhath been handed down by tradition from mother to daughter ever since.\r\nIf I was to translate this into Latin, I should render it by these two\r\nwords, _Nolo Episcopari_: a phrase likewise of immemorial use on\r\nanother occasion.\r\n\r\nThe captain, however he came by his knowledge, perfectly well\r\nunderstood the lady, and very soon after repeated his application with\r\nmore warmth and earnestness than before, and was again, according to\r\ndue form, rejected; but as he had increased in the eagerness of his\r\ndesires, so the lady, with the same propriety, decreased in the\r\nviolence of her refusal.\r\n\r\nNot to tire the reader, by leading him through every scene of this\r\ncourtship (which, though in the opinion of a certain great author, it\r\nis the pleasantest scene of life to the actor, is, perhaps, as dull\r\nand tiresome as any whatever to the audience), the captain made his\r\nadvances in form, the citadel was defended in form, and at length, in\r\nproper form, surrendered at discretion.\r\n\r\nDuring this whole time, which filled the space of near a month, the\r\ncaptain preserved great distance of behaviour to his lady in the\r\npresence of the brother; and the more he succeeded with her in\r\nprivate, the more reserved was he in public. And as for the lady, she\r\nhad no sooner secured her lover than she behaved to him before company\r\nwith the highest degree of indifference; so that Mr Allworthy must\r\nhave had the insight of the devil (or perhaps some of his worse\r\nqualities) to have entertained the least suspicion of what was going\r\nforward."

      "content": "Containing what the reader may, perhaps, expect to find in it.\r\n\nIn all bargains, whether to fight or to marry, or concerning any other\r\nsuch business, little previous ceremony is required to bring the\r\nmatter to an issue when both parties are really in earnest. This was\r\nthe case at present, and in less than a month the captain and his lady\r\nwere man and wife.\r\n\r\nThe great concern now was to break the matter to Mr Allworthy; and\r\nthis was undertaken by the doctor.\r\n\r\nOne day, then, as Allworthy was walking in his garden, the doctor came\r\nto him, and, with great gravity of aspect, and all the concern which\r\nhe could possibly affect in his countenance, said, “I am come, sir, to\r\nimpart an affair to you of the utmost consequence; but how shall I\r\nmention to you what it almost distracts me to think of!” He then\r\nlaunched forth into the most bitter invectives both against men and\r\nwomen; accusing the former of having no attachment but to their\r\ninterest, and the latter of being so addicted to vicious inclinations\r\nthat they could never be safely trusted with one of the other sex.\r\n“Could I,” said he, “sir, have suspected that a lady of such prudence,\r\nsuch judgment, such learning, should indulge so indiscreet a passion!\r\nor could I have imagined that my brother--why do I call him so? he is\r\nno longer a brother of mine----”\r\n\r\n“Indeed but he is,” said Allworthy, “and a brother of mine too.”\r\n\r\n“Bless me, sir!” said the doctor, “do you know the shocking affair?”\r\n\r\n“Look'ee, Mr Blifil,” answered the good man, “it hath been my constant\r\nmaxim in life to make the best of all matters which happen. My sister,\r\nthough many years younger than I, is at least old enough to be at the\r\nage of discretion. Had he imposed on a child, I should have been more\r\naverse to have forgiven him; but a woman upwards of thirty must\r\ncertainly be supposed to know what will make her most happy. She hath\r\nmarried a gentleman, though perhaps not quite her equal in fortune;\r\nand if he hath any perfections in her eye which can make up that\r\ndeficiency, I see no reason why I should object to her choice of her\r\nown happiness; which I, no more than herself, imagine to consist only\r\nin immense wealth. I might, perhaps, from the many declarations I have\r\nmade of complying with almost any proposal, have expected to have been\r\nconsulted on this occasion; but these matters are of a very delicate\r\nnature, and the scruples of modesty, perhaps, are not to be overcome.\r\nAs to your brother, I have really no anger against him at all. He hath\r\nno obligations to me, nor do I think he was under any necessity of\r\nasking my consent, since the woman is, as I have said, _sui juris_,\r\nand of a proper age to be entirely answerable only, to herself for her\r\nconduct.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor accused Mr Allworthy of too great lenity, repeated his\r\naccusations against his brother, and declared that he should never\r\nmore be brought either to see, or to own him for his relation. He then\r\nlaunched forth into a panegyric on Allworthy's goodness; into the\r\nhighest encomiums on his friendship; and concluded by saying, he\r\nshould never forgive his brother for having put the place which he\r\nbore in that friendship to a hazard.\r\n\r\nAllworthy thus answered: “Had I conceived any displeasure against your\r\nbrother, I should never have carried that resentment to the innocent:\r\nbut I assure you I have no such displeasure. Your brother appears to\r\nme to be a man of sense and honour. I do not disapprove the taste of\r\nmy sister; nor will I doubt but that she is equally the object of his\r\ninclinations. I have always thought love the only foundation of\r\nhappiness in a married state, as it can only produce that high and\r\ntender friendship which should always be the cement of this union;\r\nand, in my opinion, all those marriages which are contracted from\r\nother motives are greatly criminal; they are a profanation of a most\r\nholy ceremony, and generally end in disquiet and misery: for surely we\r\nmay call it a profanation to convert this most sacred institution into\r\na wicked sacrifice to lust or avarice: and what better can be said of\r\nthose matches to which men are induced merely by the consideration of\r\na beautiful person, or a great fortune?\r\n\r\n“To deny that beauty is an agreeable object to the eye, and even\r\nworthy some admiration, would be false and foolish. Beautiful is an\r\nepithet often used in Scripture, and always mentioned with honour. It\r\nwas my own fortune to marry a woman whom the world thought handsome,\r\nand I can truly say I liked her the better on that account. But to\r\nmake this the sole consideration of marriage, to lust after it so\r\nviolently as to overlook all imperfections for its sake, or to require\r\nit so absolutely as to reject and disdain religion, virtue, and sense,\r\nwhich are qualities in their nature of much higher perfection, only\r\nbecause an elegance of person is wanting: this is surely inconsistent,\r\neither with a wise man or a good Christian. And it is, perhaps, being\r\ntoo charitable to conclude that such persons mean anything more by\r\ntheir marriage than to please their carnal appetites; for the\r\nsatisfaction of which, we are taught, it was not ordained.\r\n\r\n“In the next place, with respect to fortune. Worldly prudence,\r\nperhaps, exacts some consideration on this head; nor will I absolutely\r\nand altogether condemn it. As the world is constituted, the demands of\r\na married state, and the care of posterity, require some little regard\r\nto what we call circumstances. Yet this provision is greatly\r\nincreased, beyond what is really necessary, by folly and vanity, which\r\ncreate abundantly more wants than nature. Equipage for the wife, and\r\nlarge fortunes for the children, are by custom enrolled in the list of\r\nnecessaries; and to procure these, everything truly solid and sweet,\r\nand virtuous and religious, are neglected and overlooked.\r\n\r\n“And this in many degrees; the last and greatest of which seems scarce\r\ndistinguishable from madness;--I mean where persons of immense\r\nfortunes contract themselves to those who are, and must be,\r\ndisagreeable to them--to fools and knaves--in order to increase an\r\nestate already larger even than the demands of their pleasures. Surely\r\nsuch persons, if they will not be thought mad, must own, either that\r\nthey are incapable of tasting the sweets of the tenderest friendship,\r\nor that they sacrifice the greatest happiness of which they are\r\ncapable to the vain, uncertain, and senseless laws of vulgar opinion,\r\nwhich owe as well their force as their foundation to folly.”\r\n\r\nHere Allworthy concluded his sermon, to which Blifil had listened with\r\nthe profoundest attention, though it cost him some pains to prevent\r\nnow and then a small discomposure of his muscles. He now praised every\r\nperiod of what he had heard with the warmth of a young divine, who\r\nhath the honour to dine with a bishop the same day in which his\r\nlordship hath mounted the pulpit."

      "content": "Which concludes the first book; with an instance of ingratitude,\r\nwhich, we hope, will appear unnatural.\r\n\nThe reader, from what hath been said, may imagine that the\r\nreconciliation (if indeed it could be so called) was only matter of\r\nform; we shall therefore pass it over, and hasten to what must surely\r\nbe thought matter of substance.\r\n\r\nThe doctor had acquainted his brother with what had past between Mr\r\nAllworthy and him; and added with a smile, “I promise you I paid you\r\noff; nay, I absolutely desired the good gentleman not to forgive you:\r\nfor you know after he had made a declaration in your favour, I might\r\nwith safety venture on such a request with a person of his temper; and\r\nI was willing, as well for your sake as for my own, to prevent the\r\nleast possibility of a suspicion.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Blifil took not the least notice of this, at that time; but he\r\nafterwards made a very notable use of it.\r\n\r\nOne of the maxims which the devil, in a late visit upon earth, left to\r\nhis disciples, is, when once you are got up, to kick the stool from\r\nunder you. In plain English, when you have made your fortune by the\r\ngood offices of a friend, you are advised to discard him as soon as\r\nyou can.\r\n\r\nWhether the captain acted by this maxim, I will not positively\r\ndetermine: so far we may confidently say, that his actions may be\r\nfairly derived from this diabolical principle; and indeed it is\r\ndifficult to assign any other motive to them: for no sooner was he\r\npossessed of Miss Bridget, and reconciled to Allworthy, than he began\r\nto show a coldness to his brother which increased daily; till at\r\nlength it grew into rudeness, and became very visible to every one.\r\n\r\nThe doctor remonstrated to him privately concerning this behaviour,\r\nbut could obtain no other satisfaction than the following plain\r\ndeclaration: “If you dislike anything in my brother's house, sir, you\r\nknow you are at liberty to quit it.” This strange, cruel, and almost\r\nunaccountable ingratitude in the captain, absolutely broke the poor\r\ndoctor's heart; for ingratitude never so thoroughly pierces the human\r\nbreast as when it proceeds from those in whose behalf we have been\r\nguilty of transgressions. Reflections on great and good actions,\r\nhowever they are received or returned by those in whose favour they\r\nare performed, always administer some comfort to us; but what\r\nconsolation shall we receive under so biting a calamity as the\r\nungrateful behaviour of our friend, when our wounded conscience at the\r\nsame time flies in our face, and upbraids us with having spotted it in\r\nthe service of one so worthless!\r\n\r\nMr Allworthy himself spoke to the captain in his brother's behalf, and\r\ndesired to know what offence the doctor had committed; when the\r\nhard-hearted villain had the baseness to say that he should never\r\nforgive him for the injury which he had endeavoured to do him in his\r\nfavour; which, he said, he had pumped out of him, and was such a\r\ncruelty that it ought not to be forgiven.\r\n\r\nAllworthy spoke in very high terms upon this declaration, which, he\r\nsaid, became not a human creature. He expressed, indeed, so much\r\nresentment against an unforgiving temper, that the captain at last\r\npretended to be convinced by his arguments, and outwardly professed to\r\nbe reconciled.\r\n\r\nAs for the bride, she was now in her honeymoon, and so passionately\r\nfond of her new husband that he never appeared to her to be in the\r\nwrong; and his displeasure against any person was a sufficient reason\r\nfor her dislike to the same.\r\n\r\nThe captain, at Mr Allworthy's instance, was outwardly, as we have\r\nsaid, reconciled to his brother; yet the same rancour remained in his\r\nheart; and he found so many opportunities of giving him private hints\r\nof this, that the house at last grew insupportable to the poor doctor;\r\nand he chose rather to submit to any inconveniences which he might\r\nencounter in the world, than longer to bear these cruel and ungrateful\r\ninsults from a brother for whom he had done so much.\r\n\r\nHe once intended to acquaint Allworthy with the whole; but he could\r\nnot bring himself to submit to the confession, by which he must take\r\nto his share so great a portion of guilt. Besides, by how much the\r\nworse man he represented his brother to be, so much the greater would\r\nhis own offence appear to Allworthy, and so much the greater, he had\r\nreason to imagine, would be his resentment.\r\n\r\nHe feigned, therefore, some excuse of business for his departure, and\r\npromised to return soon again; and took leave of his brother with so\r\nwell-dissembled content, that, as the captain played his part to the\r\nsame perfection, Allworthy remained well satisfied with the truth of\r\nthe reconciliation.\r\n\r\nThe doctor went directly to London, where he died soon after of a\r\nbroken heart; a distemper which kills many more than is generally\r\nimagined, and would have a fair title to a place in the bill of\r\nmortality, did it not differ in one instance from all other\r\ndiseases--viz., that no physician can cure it.\r\n\r\nNow, upon the most diligent enquiry into the former lives of these two\r\nbrothers, I find, besides the cursed and hellish maxim of policy above\r\nmentioned, another reason for the captain's conduct: the captain,\r\nbesides what we have before said of him, was a man of great pride and\r\nfierceness, and had always treated his brother, who was of a different\r\ncomplexion, and greatly deficient in both these qualities, with the\r\nutmost air of superiority. The doctor, however, had much the larger\r\nshare of learning, and was by many reputed to have the better\r\nunderstanding. This the captain knew, and could not bear; for though\r\nenvy is at best a very malignant passion, yet is its bitterness\r\ngreatly heightened by mixing with contempt towards the same object;\r\nand very much afraid I am, that whenever an obligation is joined to\r\nthese two, indignation and not gratitude will be the product of all\r\nthree.\r\n\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\nCONTAINING SCENES OF MATRIMONIAL FELICITY IN DIFFERENT DEGREES OF\r\nLIFE; AND VARIOUS OTHER TRANSACTIONS DURING THE FIRST TWO YEARS AFTER\r\nTHE MARRIAGE BETWEEN CAPTAIN BLIFIL AND MISS BRIDGET ALLWORTHY."

      "content": "Showing what kind of a history this is; what it is like, and what it\r\nis not like.\r\n\nThough we have properly enough entitled this our work, a history, and\r\nnot a life; nor an apology for a life, as is more in fashion; yet we\r\nintend in it rather to pursue the method of those writers, who profess\r\nto disclose the revolutions of countries, than to imitate the painful\r\nand voluminous historian, who, to preserve the regularity of his\r\nseries, thinks himself obliged to fill up as much paper with the\r\ndetail of months and years in which nothing remarkable happened, as he\r\nemploys upon those notable aeras when the greatest scenes have been\r\ntransacted on the human stage.\r\n\r\nSuch histories as these do, in reality, very much resemble a\r\nnewspaper, which consists of just the same number of words, whether\r\nthere be any news in it or not. They may likewise be compared to a\r\nstage coach, which performs constantly the same course, empty as well\r\nas full. The writer, indeed, seems to think himself obliged to keep\r\neven pace with time, whose amanuensis he is; and, like his master,\r\ntravels as slowly through centuries of monkish dulness, when the world\r\nseems to have been asleep, as through that bright and busy age so\r\nnobly distinguished by the excellent Latin poet--\r\n\r\n _Ad confligendum venientibus undique poenis,\r\n Omnia cum belli trepido concussa tumultu\r\n Horrida contremuere sub altis aetheris auris;\r\n In dubioque fuit sub utrorum regna cadendum\r\n Omnibus humanis esset, terraque marique._\r\n\r\nOf which we wish we could give our readers a more adequate translation\r\nthan that by Mr Creech--\r\n\r\n When dreadful Carthage frighted Rome with arms,\r\n And all the world was shook with fierce alarms;\r\n Whilst undecided yet, which part should fall,\r\n Which nation rise the glorious lord of all.\r\n\r\nNow it is our purpose, in the ensuing pages, to pursue a contrary\r\nmethod. When any extraordinary scene presents itself (as we trust will\r\noften be the case), we shall spare no pains nor paper to open it at\r\nlarge to our reader; but if whole years should pass without producing\r\nanything worthy his notice, we shall not be afraid of a chasm in our\r\nhistory; but shall hasten on to matters of consequence, and leave such\r\nperiods of time totally unobserved.\r\n\r\nThese are indeed to be considered as blanks in the grand lottery of\r\ntime. We therefore, who are the registers of that lottery, shall\r\nimitate those sagacious persons who deal in that which is drawn at\r\nGuildhall, and who never trouble the public with the many blanks they\r\ndispose of; but when a great prize happens to be drawn, the newspapers\r\nare presently filled with it, and the world is sure to be informed at\r\nwhose office it was sold: indeed, commonly two or three different\r\noffices lay claim to the honour of having disposed of it; by which, I\r\nsuppose, the adventurers are given to understand that certain brokers\r\nare in the secrets of Fortune, and indeed of her cabinet council.\r\n\r\nMy reader then is not to be surprized, if, in the course of this work,\r\nhe shall find some chapters very short, and others altogether as long;\r\nsome that contain only the time of a single day, and others that\r\ncomprise years; in a word, if my history sometimes seems to stand\r\nstill, and sometimes to fly. For all which I shall not look on myself\r\nas accountable to any court of critical jurisdiction whatever: for as\r\nI am, in reality, the founder of a new province of writing, so I am at\r\nliberty to make what laws I please therein. And these laws, my\r\nreaders, whom I consider as my subjects, are bound to believe in and\r\nto obey; with which that they may readily and cheerfully comply, I do\r\nhereby assure them that I shall principally regard their ease and\r\nadvantage in all such institutions: for I do not, like a _jure divino_\r\ntyrant, imagine that they are my slaves, or my commodity. I am,\r\nindeed, set over them for their own good only, and was created for\r\ntheir use, and not they for mine. Nor do I doubt, while I make their\r\ninterest the great rule of my writings, they will unanimously concur\r\nin supporting my dignity, and in rendering me all the honour I shall\r\ndeserve or desire."

      "content": "Religious cautions against showing too much favour to bastards; and a\r\ngreat discovery made by Mrs Deborah Wilkins.\r\n\nEight months after the celebration of the nuptials between Captain\r\nBlifil and Miss Bridget Allworthy, a young lady of great beauty,\r\nmerit, and fortune, was Miss Bridget, by reason of a fright, delivered\r\nof a fine boy. The child was indeed to all appearances perfect; but\r\nthe midwife discovered it was born a month before its full time.\r\n\r\nThough the birth of an heir by his beloved sister was a circumstance\r\nof great joy to Mr Allworthy, yet it did not alienate his affections\r\nfrom the little foundling, to whom he had been godfather, had given\r\nhis own name of Thomas, and whom he had hitherto seldom failed of\r\nvisiting, at least once a day, in his nursery.\r\n\r\nHe told his sister, if she pleased, the new-born infant should be bred\r\nup together with little Tommy; to which she consented, though with\r\nsome little reluctance: for she had truly a great complacence for her\r\nbrother; and hence she had always behaved towards the foundling with\r\nrather more kindness than ladies of rigid virtue can sometimes bring\r\nthemselves to show to these children, who, however innocent, may be\r\ntruly called the living monuments of incontinence.\r\n\r\nThe captain could not so easily bring himself to bear what he\r\ncondemned as a fault in Mr Allworthy. He gave him frequent hints, that\r\nto adopt the fruits of sin, was to give countenance to it. He quoted\r\nseveral texts (for he was well read in Scripture), such as, _He visits\r\nthe sins of the fathers upon the children; and the fathers have eaten\r\nsour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge_,&c. Whence he\r\nargued the legality of punishing the crime of the parent on the\r\nbastard. He said, “Though the law did not positively allow the\r\ndestroying such base-born children, yet it held them to be the\r\nchildren of nobody; that the Church considered them as the children of\r\nnobody; and that at the best, they ought to be brought up to the\r\nlowest and vilest offices of the commonwealth.”\r\n\r\nMr Allworthy answered to all this, and much more, which the captain\r\nhad urged on this subject, “That, however guilty the parents might be,\r\nthe children were certainly innocent: that as to the texts he had\r\nquoted, the former of them was a particular denunciation against the\r\nJews, for the sin of idolatry, of relinquishing and hating their\r\nheavenly King; and the latter was parabolically spoken, and rather\r\nintended to denote the certain and necessary consequences of sin, than\r\nany express judgment against it. But to represent the Almighty as\r\navenging the sins of the guilty on the innocent, was indecent, if not\r\nblasphemous, as it was to represent him acting against the first\r\nprinciples of natural justice, and against the original notions of\r\nright and wrong, which he himself had implanted in our minds; by which\r\nwe were to judge not only in all matters which were not revealed, but\r\neven of the truth of revelation itself. He said he knew many held the\r\nsame principles with the captain on this head; but he was himself\r\nfirmly convinced to the contrary, and would provide in the same manner\r\nfor this poor infant, as if a legitimate child had had fortune to have\r\nbeen found in the same place.”\r\n\r\nWhile the captain was taking all opportunities to press these and such\r\nlike arguments, to remove the little foundling from Mr Allworthy's, of\r\nwhose fondness for him he began to be jealous, Mrs Deborah had made a\r\ndiscovery, which, in its event, threatened at least to prove more\r\nfatal to poor Tommy than all the reasonings of the captain.\r\n\r\nWhether the insatiable curiosity of this good woman had carried her on\r\nto that business, or whether she did it to confirm herself in the good\r\ngraces of Mrs Blifil, who, notwithstanding her outward behaviour to\r\nthe foundling, frequently abused the infant in private, and her\r\nbrother too, for his fondness to it, I will not determine; but she had\r\nnow, as she conceived, fully detected the father of the foundling.\r\n\r\nNow, as this was a discovery of great consequence, it may be necessary\r\nto trace it from the fountain-head. We shall therefore very minutely\r\nlay open those previous matters by which it was produced; and for that\r\npurpose we shall be obliged to reveal all the secrets of a little\r\nfamily with which my reader is at present entirely unacquainted; and\r\nof which the oeconomy was so rare and extraordinary, that I fear it\r\nwill shock the utmost credulity of many married persons."

      "content": "The description of a domestic government founded upon rules directly\r\ncontrary to those of Aristotle.\r\n\nMy reader may please to remember he hath been informed that Jenny\r\nJones had lived some years with a certain schoolmaster, who had, at\r\nher earnest desire, instructed her in Latin, in which, to do justice\r\nto her genius, she had so improved herself, that she was become a\r\nbetter scholar than her master.\r\n\r\nIndeed, though this poor man had undertaken a profession to which\r\nlearning must be allowed necessary, this was the least of his\r\ncommendations. He was one of the best-natured fellows in the world,\r\nand was, at the same time, master of so much pleasantry and humour,\r\nthat he was reputed the wit of the country; and all the neighbouring\r\ngentlemen were so desirous of his company, that as denying was not his\r\ntalent, he spent much time at their houses, which he might, with more\r\nemolument, have spent in his school.\r\n\r\nIt may be imagined that a gentleman so qualified and so disposed, was\r\nin no danger of becoming formidable to the learned seminaries of Eton\r\nor Westminster. To speak plainly, his scholars were divided into two\r\nclasses: in the upper of which was a young gentleman, the son of a\r\nneighbouring squire, who, at the age of seventeen, was just entered\r\ninto his Syntaxis; and in the lower was a second son of the same\r\ngentleman, who, together with seven parish-boys, was learning to read\r\nand write.\r\n\r\nThe stipend arising hence would hardly have indulged the schoolmaster\r\nin the luxuries of life, had he not added to this office those of\r\nclerk and barber, and had not Mr Allworthy added to the whole an\r\nannuity of ten pounds, which the poor man received every Christmas,\r\nand with which he was enabled to cheer his heart during that sacred\r\nfestival.\r\n\r\nAmong his other treasures, the pedagogue had a wife, whom he had\r\nmarried out of Mr Allworthy's kitchen for her fortune, viz., twenty\r\npounds, which she had there amassed.\r\n\r\nThis woman was not very amiable in her person. Whether she sat to my\r\nfriend Hogarth, or no, I will not determine; but she exactly resembled\r\nthe young woman who is pouring out her mistress's tea in the third\r\npicture of the Harlot's Progress. She was, besides, a profest follower\r\nof that noble sect founded by Xantippe of old; by means of which she\r\nbecame more formidable in the school than her husband; for, to confess\r\nthe truth, he was never master there, or anywhere else, in her\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nThough her countenance did not denote much natural sweetness of\r\ntemper, yet this was, perhaps, somewhat soured by a circumstance which\r\ngenerally poisons matrimonial felicity; for children are rightly\r\ncalled the pledges of love; and her husband, though they had been\r\nmarried nine years, had given her no such pledges; a default for which\r\nhe had no excuse, either from age or health, being not yet thirty\r\nyears old, and what they call a jolly brisk young man.\r\n\r\nHence arose another evil, which produced no little uneasiness to the\r\npoor pedagogue, of whom she maintained so constant a jealousy, that he\r\ndurst hardly speak to one woman in the parish; for the least degree of\r\ncivility, or even correspondence, with any female, was sure to bring\r\nhis wife upon her back, and his own.\r\n\r\nIn order to guard herself against matrimonial injuries in her own\r\nhouse, as she kept one maid-servant, she always took care to chuse her\r\nout of that order of females whose faces are taken as a kind of\r\nsecurity for their virtue; of which number Jenny Jones, as the reader\r\nhath been before informed, was one.\r\n\r\nAs the face of this young woman might be called pretty good security\r\nof the before-mentioned kind, and as her behaviour had been always\r\nextremely modest, which is the certain consequence of understanding in\r\nwomen; she had passed above four years at Mr Partridge's (for that was\r\nthe schoolmaster's name) without creating the least suspicion in her\r\nmistress. Nay, she had been treated with uncommon kindness, and her\r\nmistress had permitted Mr Partridge to give her those instructions\r\nwhich have been before commemorated.\r\n\r\nBut it is with jealousy as with the gout: when such distempers are in\r\nthe blood, there is never any security against their breaking out; and\r\nthat often on the slightest occasions, and when least suspected.\r\n\r\nThus it happened to Mrs Partridge, who had submitted four years to her\r\nhusband's teaching this young woman, and had suffered her often to\r\nneglect her work, in order to pursue her learning. For, passing by one\r\nday, as the girl was reading, and her master leaning over her, the\r\ngirl, I know not for what reason, suddenly started up from her chair:\r\nand this was the first time that suspicion ever entered into the head\r\nof her mistress. This did not, however, at that time discover itself,\r\nbut lay lurking in her mind, like a concealed enemy, who waits for a\r\nreinforcement of additional strength before he openly declares himself\r\nand proceeds upon hostile operations: and such additional strength\r\nsoon arrived to corroborate her suspicion; for not long after, the\r\nhusband and wife being at dinner, the master said to his maid, _Da\r\nmihi aliquid potum:_ upon which the poor girl smiled, perhaps at the\r\nbadness of the Latin, and, when her mistress cast her eyes on her,\r\nblushed, possibly with a consciousness of having laughed at her\r\nmaster. Mrs Partridge, upon this, immediately fell into a fury, and\r\ndischarged the trencher on which she was eating, at the head of poor\r\nJenny, crying out, “You impudent whore, do you play tricks with my\r\nhusband before my face?” and at the same instant rose from her chair\r\nwith a knife in her hand, with which, most probably, she would have\r\nexecuted very tragical vengeance, had not the girl taken the advantage\r\nof being nearer the door than her mistress, and avoided her fury by\r\nrunning away: for, as to the poor husband, whether surprize had\r\nrendered him motionless, or fear (which is full as probable) had\r\nrestrained him from venturing at any opposition, he sat staring and\r\ntrembling in his chair; nor did he once offer to move or speak, till\r\nhis wife, returning from the pursuit of Jenny, made some defensive\r\nmeasures necessary for his own preservation; and he likewise was\r\nobliged to retreat, after the example of the maid.\r\n\r\nThis good woman was, no more than Othello, of a disposition\r\n\r\n To make a life of jealousy\r\n And follow still the changes of the moon\r\n With fresh suspicions--\r\n\r\nWith her, as well as him,\r\n\r\n --To be once in doubt,\r\n Was once to be resolvd--\r\n\r\nshe therefore ordered Jenny immediately to pack up her alls and\r\nbegone, for that she was determined she should not sleep that night\r\nwithin her walls.\r\n\r\nMr Partridge had profited too much by experience to interpose in a\r\nmatter of this nature. He therefore had recourse to his usual receipt\r\nof patience, for, though he was not a great adept in Latin, he\r\nremembered, and well understood, the advice contained in these words\r\n\r\n --_Leve fit quod bene fertur onus_\r\n\r\nin English:\r\n\r\n A burden becomes lightest when it is well borne--\r\n\r\nwhich he had always in his mouth; and of which, to say the truth, he\r\nhad often occasion to experience the truth.\r\n\r\nJenny offered to make protestations of her innocence; but the tempest\r\nwas too strong for her to be heard. She then betook herself to the\r\nbusiness of packing, for which a small quantity of brown paper\r\nsufficed, and, having received her small pittance of wages, she\r\nreturned home.\r\n\r\nThe schoolmaster and his consort passed their time unpleasantly enough\r\nthat evening, but something or other happened before the next morning,\r\nwhich a little abated the fury of Mrs Partridge; and she at length\r\nadmitted her husband to make his excuses: to which she gave the\r\nreadier belief, as he had, instead of desiring her to recall Jenny,\r\nprofessed a satisfaction in her being dismissed, saying, she was grown\r\nof little use as a servant, spending all her time in reading, and was\r\nbecome, moreover, very pert and obstinate; for, indeed, she and her\r\nmaster had lately had frequent disputes in literature; in which, as\r\nhath been said, she was become greatly his superior. This, however, he\r\nwould by no means allow; and as he called her persisting in the right,\r\nobstinacy, he began to hate her with no small inveteracy."

      "content": "Containing one of the most bloody battles, or rather duels, that were\r\never recorded in domestic history.\r\n\nFor the reasons mentioned in the preceding chapter, and from some\r\nother matrimonial concessions, well known to most husbands, and which,\r\nlike the secrets of freemasonry, should be divulged to none who are\r\nnot members of that honourable fraternity, Mrs Partridge was pretty\r\nwell satisfied that she had condemned her husband without cause, and\r\nendeavoured by acts of kindness to make him amends for her false\r\nsuspicion. Her passions were indeed equally violent, whichever way\r\nthey inclined; for as she could be extremely angry, so could she be\r\naltogether as fond.\r\n\r\nBut though these passions ordinarily succeed each other, and scarce\r\ntwenty-four hours ever passed in which the pedagogue was not, in some\r\ndegree, the object of both; yet, on extraordinary occasions, when the\r\npassion of anger had raged very high, the remission was usually\r\nlonger: and so was the case at present; for she continued longer in a\r\nstate of affability, after this fit of jealousy was ended, than her\r\nhusband had ever known before: and, had it not been for some little\r\nexercises, which all the followers of Xantippe are obliged to perform\r\ndaily, Mr Partridge would have enjoyed a perfect serenity of several\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nPerfect calms at sea are always suspected by the experienced mariner\r\nto be the forerunners of a storm, and I know some persons, who,\r\nwithout being generally the devotees of superstition, are apt to\r\napprehend that great and unusual peace or tranquillity will be\r\nattended with its opposite. For which reason the antients used, on\r\nsuch occasions, to sacrifice to the goddess Nemesis, a deity who was\r\nthought by them to look with an invidious eye on human felicity, and\r\nto have a peculiar delight in overturning it.\r\n\r\nAs we are very far from believing in any such heathen goddess, or from\r\nencouraging any superstition, so we wish Mr John Fr----, or some other\r\nsuch philosopher, would bestir himself a little, in order to find out\r\nthe real cause of this sudden transition from good to bad fortune,\r\nwhich hath been so often remarked, and of which we shall proceed to\r\ngive an instance; for it is our province to relate facts, and we shall\r\nleave causes to persons of much higher genius.\r\n\r\nMankind have always taken great delight in knowing and descanting on\r\nthe actions of others. Hence there have been, in all ages and nations,\r\ncertain places set apart for public rendezvous, where the curious\r\nmight meet and satisfy their mutual curiosity. Among these, the\r\nbarbers' shops have justly borne the pre-eminence. Among the Greeks,\r\nbarbers' news was a proverbial expression; and Horace, in one of his\r\nepistles, makes honourable mention of the Roman barbers in the same\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nThose of England are known to be no wise inferior to their Greek or\r\nRoman predecessors. You there see foreign affairs discussed in a\r\nmanner little inferior to that with which they are handled in the\r\ncoffee-houses; and domestic occurrences are much more largely and\r\nfreely treated in the former than in the latter. But this serves only\r\nfor the men. Now, whereas the females of this country, especially\r\nthose of the lower order, do associate themselves much more than those\r\nof other nations, our polity would be highly deficient, if they had\r\nnot some place set apart likewise for the indulgence of their\r\ncuriosity, seeing they are in this no way inferior to the other half\r\nof the species.\r\n\r\nIn enjoying, therefore, such place of rendezvous, the British fair\r\nought to esteem themselves more happy than any of their foreign\r\nsisters; as I do not remember either to have read in history, or to\r\nhave seen in my travels, anything of the like kind.\r\n\r\nThis place then is no other than the chandler's shop, the known seat\r\nof all the news; or, as it is vulgarly called, gossiping, in every\r\nparish in England.\r\n\r\nMrs Partridge being one day at this assembly of females, was asked by\r\none of her neighbours, if she had heard no news lately of Jenny Jones?\r\nTo which she answered in the negative. Upon this the other replied,\r\nwith a smile, That the parish was very much obliged to her for having\r\nturned Jenny away as she did.\r\n\r\nMrs Partridge, whose jealousy, as the reader well knows, was long\r\nsince cured, and who had no other quarrel to her maid, answered\r\nboldly, She did not know any obligation the parish had to her on that\r\naccount; for she believed Jenny had scarce left her equal behind her.\r\n\r\n“No, truly,” said the gossip, “I hope not, though I fancy we have\r\nsluts enow too. Then you have not heard, it seems, that she hath been\r\nbrought to bed of two bastards? but as they are not born here, my\r\nhusband and the other overseer says we shall not be obliged to keep\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n“Two bastards!” answered Mrs Partridge hastily: “you surprize me! I\r\ndon't know whether we must keep them; but I am sure they must have\r\nbeen begotten here, for the wench hath not been nine months gone\r\naway.”\r\n\r\nNothing can be so quick and sudden as the operations of the mind,\r\nespecially when hope, or fear, or jealousy, to which the two others\r\nare but journeymen, set it to work. It occurred instantly to her, that\r\nJenny had scarce ever been out of her own house while she lived with\r\nher. The leaning over the chair, the sudden starting up, the Latin,\r\nthe smile, and many other things, rushed upon her all at once. The\r\nsatisfaction her husband expressed in the departure of Jenny, appeared\r\nnow to be only dissembled; again, in the same instant, to be real; but\r\nyet to confirm her jealousy, proceeding from satiety, and a hundred\r\nother bad causes. In a word, she was convinced of her husband's guilt,\r\nand immediately left the assembly in confusion.\r\n\r\nAs fair Grimalkin, who, though the youngest of the feline family,\r\ndegenerates not in ferocity from the elder branches of her house, and\r\nthough inferior in strength, is equal in fierceness to the noble tiger\r\nhimself, when a little mouse, whom it hath long tormented in sport,\r\nescapes from her clutches for a while, frets, scolds, growls, swears;\r\nbut if the trunk, or box, behind which the mouse lay hid be again\r\nremoved, she flies like lightning on her prey, and, with envenomed\r\nwrath, bites, scratches, mumbles, and tears the little animal.\r\n\r\nNot with less fury did Mrs Partridge fly on the poor pedagogue. Her\r\ntongue, teeth, and hands, fell all upon him at once. His wig was in an\r\ninstant torn from his head, his shirt from his back, and from his face\r\ndescended five streams of blood, denoting the number of claws with\r\nwhich nature had unhappily armed the enemy.\r\n\r\nMr Partridge acted for some time on the defensive only; indeed he\r\nattempted only to guard his face with his hands; but as he found that\r\nhis antagonist abated nothing of her rage, he thought he might, at\r\nleast, endeavour to disarm her, or rather to confine her arms; in\r\ndoing which her cap fell off in the struggle, and her hair being too\r\nshort to reach her shoulders, erected itself on her head; her stays\r\nlikewise, which were laced through one single hole at the bottom,\r\nburst open; and her breasts, which were much more redundant than her\r\nhair, hung down below her middle; her face was likewise marked with\r\nthe blood of her husband: her teeth gnashed with rage; and fire, such\r\nas sparkles from a smith's forge, darted from her eyes. So that,\r\naltogether, this Amazonian heroine might have been an object of terror\r\nto a much bolder man than Mr Partridge.\r\n\r\nHe had, at length, the good fortune, by getting possession of her\r\narms, to render those weapons which she wore at the ends of her\r\nfingers useless; which she no sooner perceived, than the softness of\r\nher sex prevailed over her rage, and she presently dissolved in tears,\r\nwhich soon after concluded in a fit.\r\n\r\nThat small share of sense which Mr Partridge had hitherto preserved\r\nthrough this scene of fury, of the cause of which he was hitherto\r\nignorant, now utterly abandoned him. He ran instantly into the street,\r\nhallowing out that his wife was in the agonies of death, and\r\nbeseeching the neighbours to fly with the utmost haste to her\r\nassistance. Several good women obeyed his summons, who entering his\r\nhouse, and applying the usual remedies on such occasions, Mrs\r\nPartridge was at length, to the great joy of her husband, brought to\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she had a little recollected her spirits, and somewhat\r\ncomposed herself with a cordial, she began to inform the company of\r\nthe manifold injuries she had received from her husband; who, she\r\nsaid, was not contented to injure her in her bed; but, upon her\r\nupbraiding him with it, had treated her in the cruelest manner\r\nimaginable; had tore her cap and hair from her head, and her stays\r\nfrom her body, giving her, at the same time, several blows, the marks\r\nof which she should carry to the grave.\r\n\r\nThe poor man, who bore on his face many more visible marks of the\r\nindignation of his wife, stood in silent astonishment at this\r\naccusation; which the reader will, I believe, bear witness for him,\r\nhad greatly exceeded the truth; for indeed he had not struck her once;\r\nand this silence being interpreted to be a confession of the charge by\r\nthe whole court, they all began at once, _una voce_, to rebuke and\r\nrevile him, repeating often, that none but a coward ever struck a\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nMr Partridge bore all this patiently; but when his wife appealed to\r\nthe blood on her face, as an evidence of his barbarity, he could not\r\nhelp laying claim to his own blood, for so it really was; as he\r\nthought it very unnatural, that this should rise up (as we are taught\r\nthat of a murdered person often doth) in vengeance against him.\r\n\r\nTo this the women made no other answer, than that it was a pity it had\r\nnot come from his heart, instead of his face; all declaring, that, if\r\ntheir husbands should lift their hands against them, they would have\r\ntheir hearts' bloods out of their bodies.\r\n\r\nAfter much admonition for what was past, and much good advice to Mr\r\nPartridge for his future behaviour, the company at length departed,\r\nand left the husband and wife to a personal conference together, in\r\nwhich Mr Partridge soon learned the cause of all his sufferings."

      "content": "Containing much matter to exercise the judgment and reflection of the\r\nreader.\r\n\nI believe it is a true observation, that few secrets are divulged to\r\none person only; but certainly, it would be next to a miracle that a\r\nfact of this kind should be known to a whole parish, and not transpire\r\nany farther.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, a very few days had past, before the country, to use a\r\ncommon phrase, rung of the schoolmaster of Little Baddington; who was\r\nsaid to have beaten his wife in the most cruel manner. Nay, in some\r\nplaces it was reported he had murdered her; in others, that he had\r\nbroke her arms; in others, her legs: in short, there was scarce an\r\ninjury which can be done to a human creature, but what Mrs Partridge\r\nwas somewhere or other affirmed to have received from her husband.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this quarrel was likewise variously reported; for as some\r\npeople said that Mrs Partridge had caught her husband in bed with his\r\nmaid, so many other reasons, of a very different kind, went abroad.\r\nNay, some transferred the guilt to the wife, and the jealousy to the\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\nMrs Wilkins had long ago heard of this quarrel; but, as a different\r\ncause from the true one had reached her ears, she thought proper to\r\nconceal it; and the rather, perhaps, as the blame was universally laid\r\non Mr Partridge; and his wife, when she was servant to Mr Allworthy,\r\nhad in something offended Mrs Wilkins, who was not of a very forgiving\r\ntemper.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs Wilkins, whose eyes could see objects at a distance, and who\r\ncould very well look forward a few years into futurity, had perceived\r\na strong likelihood of Captain Blifil's being hereafter her master;\r\nand as she plainly discerned that the captain bore no great goodwill\r\nto the little foundling, she fancied it would be rendering him an\r\nagreeable service, if she could make any discoveries that might lessen\r\nthe affection which Mr Allworthy seemed to have contracted for this\r\nchild, and which gave visible uneasiness to the captain, who could not\r\nentirely conceal it even before Allworthy himself; though his wife,\r\nwho acted her part much better in public, frequently recommended to\r\nhim her own example, of conniving at the folly of her brother, which,\r\nshe said, she at least as well perceived, and as much resented, as any\r\nother possibly could.\r\n\r\nMrs Wilkins having therefore, by accident, gotten a true scent of the\r\nabove story,--though long after it had happened, failed not to satisfy\r\nherself thoroughly of all the particulars; and then acquainted the\r\ncaptain, that she had at last discovered the true father of the little\r\nbastard, which she was sorry, she said, to see her master lose his\r\nreputation in the country, by taking so much notice of.\r\n\r\nThe captain chid her for the conclusion of her speech, as an improper\r\nassurance in judging of her master's actions: for if his honour, or\r\nhis understanding, would have suffered the captain to make an alliance\r\nwith Mrs Wilkins, his pride would by no means have admitted it. And to\r\nsay the truth, there is no conduct less politic, than to enter into\r\nany confederacy with your friend's servants against their master: for\r\nby these means you afterwards become the slave of these very servants;\r\nby whom you are constantly liable to be betrayed. And this\r\nconsideration, perhaps it was, which prevented Captain Blifil from\r\nbeing more explicit with Mrs Wilkins, or from encouraging the abuse\r\nwhich she had bestowed on Allworthy.\r\n\r\nBut though he declared no satisfaction to Mrs Wilkins at this\r\ndiscovery, he enjoyed not a little from it in his own mind, and\r\nresolved to make the best use of it he was able.\r\n\r\nHe kept this matter a long time concealed within his own breast, in\r\nhopes that Mr Allworthy might hear it from some other person; but Mrs\r\nWilkins, whether she resented the captain's behaviour, or whether his\r\ncunning was beyond her, and she feared the discovery might displease\r\nhim, never afterwards opened her lips about the matter.\r\n\r\nI have thought it somewhat strange, upon reflection, that the\r\nhousekeeper never acquainted Mrs Blifil with this news, as women are\r\nmore inclined to communicate all pieces of intelligence to their own\r\nsex, than to ours. The only way, as it appears to me, of solving this\r\ndifficulty, is, by imputing it to that distance which was now grown\r\nbetween the lady and the housekeeper: whether this arose from a\r\njealousy in Mrs Blifil, that Wilkins showed too great a respect to the\r\nfoundling; for while she was endeavouring to ruin the little infant,\r\nin order to ingratiate herself with the captain, she was every day\r\nmore and more commending it before Allworthy, as his fondness for it\r\nevery day increased. This, notwithstanding all the care she took at\r\nother times to express the direct contrary to Mrs Blifil, perhaps\r\noffended that delicate lady, who certainly now hated Mrs Wilkins; and\r\nthough she did not, or possibly could not, absolutely remove her from\r\nher place, she found, however, the means of making her life very\r\nuneasy. This Mrs Wilkins, at length, so resented, that she very openly\r\nshowed all manner of respect and fondness to little Tommy, in\r\nopposition to Mrs Blifil.\r\n\r\nThe captain, therefore, finding the story in danger of perishing, at\r\nlast took an opportunity to reveal it himself.\r\n\r\nHe was one day engaged with Mr Allworthy in a discourse on charity: in\r\nwhich the captain, with great learning, proved to Mr Allworthy, that\r\nthe word charity in Scripture nowhere means beneficence or generosity.\r\n\r\n“The Christian religion,” he said, “was instituted for much nobler\r\npurposes, than to enforce a lesson which many heathen philosophers had\r\ntaught us long before, and which, though it might perhaps be called a\r\nmoral virtue, savoured but little of that sublime, Christian-like\r\ndisposition, that vast elevation of thought, in purity approaching to\r\nangelic perfection, to be attained, expressed, and felt only by grace.\r\nThose,” he said, “came nearer to the Scripture meaning, who understood\r\nby it candour, or the forming of a benevolent opinion of our brethren,\r\nand passing a favourable judgment on their actions; a virtue much\r\nhigher, and more extensive in its nature, than a pitiful distribution\r\nof alms, which, though we would never so much prejudice, or even ruin\r\nour families, could never reach many; whereas charity, in the other\r\nand truer sense, might be extended to all mankind.”\r\n\r\nHe said, “Considering who the disciples were, it would be absurd to\r\nconceive the doctrine of generosity, or giving alms, to have been\r\npreached to them. And, as we could not well imagine this doctrine\r\nshould be preached by its Divine Author to men who could not practise\r\nit, much less should we think it understood so by those who can\r\npractise it, and do not.\r\n\r\n“But though,” continued he, “there is, I am afraid, little merit in\r\nthese benefactions, there would, I must confess, be much pleasure in\r\nthem to a good mind, if it was not abated by one consideration. I\r\nmean, that we are liable to be imposed upon, and to confer our\r\nchoicest favours often on the undeserving, as you must own was your\r\ncase in your bounty to that worthless fellow Partridge: for two or\r\nthree such examples must greatly lessen the inward satisfaction which\r\na good man would otherwise find in generosity; nay, may even make him\r\ntimorous in bestowing, lest he should be guilty of supporting vice,\r\nand encouraging the wicked; a crime of a very black dye, and for which\r\nit will by no means be a sufficient excuse, that we have not actually\r\nintended such an encouragement; unless we have used the utmost caution\r\nin chusing the objects of our beneficence. A consideration which, I\r\nmake no doubt, hath greatly checked the liberality of many a worthy\r\nand pious man.”\r\n\r\nMr Allworthy answered, “He could not dispute with the captain in the\r\nGreek language, and therefore could say nothing as to the true sense\r\nof the word which is translated charity; but that he had always\r\nthought it was interpreted to consist in action, and that giving alms\r\nconstituted at least one branch of that virtue.\r\n\r\n“As to the meritorious part,” he said, “he readily agreed with the\r\ncaptain; for where could be the merit of barely discharging a duty?\r\nwhich,” he said, “let the word charity have what construction it\r\nwould, it sufficiently appeared to be from the whole tenor of the New\r\nTestament. And as he thought it an indispensable duty, enjoined both\r\nby the Christian law, and by the law of nature itself; so was it\r\nwithal so pleasant, that if any duty could be said to be its own\r\nreward, or to pay us while we are discharging it, it was this.\r\n\r\n“To confess the truth,” said he, “there is one degree of generosity\r\n(of charity I would have called it), which seems to have some show of\r\nmerit, and that is, where, from a principle of benevolence and\r\nChristian love, we bestow on another what we really want ourselves;\r\nwhere, in order to lessen the distresses of another, we condescend to\r\nshare some part of them, by giving what even our own necessities\r\ncannot well spare. This is, I think, meritorious; but to relieve our\r\nbrethren only with our superfluities; to be charitable (I must use the\r\nword) rather at the expense of our coffers than ourselves; to save\r\nseveral families from misery rather than hang up an extraordinary\r\npicture in our houses or gratify any other idle ridiculous\r\nvanity--this seems to be only being human creatures. Nay, I will\r\nventure to go farther, it is being in some degree epicures: for what\r\ncould the greatest epicure wish rather than to eat with many mouths\r\ninstead of one? which I think may be predicated of any one who knows\r\nthat the bread of many is owing to his own largesses.\r\n\r\n“As to the apprehension of bestowing bounty on such as may hereafter\r\nprove unworthy objects, because many have proved such; surely it can\r\nnever deter a good man from generosity. I do not think a few or many\r\nexamples of ingratitude can justify a man's hardening his heart\r\nagainst the distresses of his fellow-creatures; nor do I believe it\r\ncan ever have such effect on a truly benevolent mind. Nothing less\r\nthan a persuasion of universal depravity can lock up the charity of a\r\ngood man; and this persuasion must lead him, I think, either into\r\natheism, or enthusiasm; but surely it is unfair to argue such\r\nuniversal depravity from a few vicious individuals; nor was this, I\r\nbelieve, ever done by a man, who, upon searching his own mind, found\r\none certain exception to the general rule.” He then concluded by\r\nasking, “who that Partridge was, whom he had called a worthless\r\nfellow?”\r\n\r\n“I mean,” said the captain, “Partridge the barber, the schoolmaster,\r\nwhat do you call him? Partridge, the father of the little child which\r\nyou found in your bed.”\r\n\r\nMr Allworthy exprest great surprize at this account, and the captain\r\nas great at his ignorance of it; for he said he had known it above a\r\nmonth: and at length recollected with much difficulty that he was told\r\nit by Mrs Wilkins.\r\n\r\nUpon this, Wilkins was immediately summoned; who having confirmed what\r\nthe captain had said, was by Mr Allworthy, by and with the captain's\r\nadvice, dispatched to Little Baddington, to inform herself of the\r\ntruth of the fact: for the captain exprest great dislike at all hasty\r\nproceedings in criminal matters, and said he would by no means have Mr\r\nAllworthy take any resolution either to the prejudice of the child or\r\nits father, before he was satisfied that the latter was guilty; for\r\nthough he had privately satisfied himself of this from one of\r\nPartridge's neighbours, yet he was too generous to give any such\r\nevidence to Mr Allworthy."

      "content": "The trial of Partridge, the schoolmaster, for incontinency; the\r\nevidence of his wife; a short reflection on the wisdom of our law;\r\nwith other grave matters, which those will like best who understand\r\nthem most.\r\n\nIt may be wondered that a story so well known, and which had furnished\r\nso much matter of conversation, should never have been mentioned to Mr\r\nAllworthy himself, who was perhaps the only person in that country who\r\nhad never heard of it.\r\n\r\nTo account in some measure for this to the reader, I think proper to\r\ninform him, that there was no one in the kingdom less interested in\r\nopposing that doctrine concerning the meaning of the word charity,\r\nwhich hath been seen in the preceding chapter, than our good man.\r\nIndeed, he was equally intitled to this virtue in either sense; for as\r\nno man was ever more sensible of the wants, or more ready to relieve\r\nthe distresses of others, so none could be more tender of their\r\ncharacters, or slower to believe anything to their disadvantage.\r\n\r\nScandal, therefore, never found any access to his table; for as it\r\nhath been long since observed that you may know a man by his\r\ncompanions, so I will venture to say, that, by attending to the\r\nconversation at a great man's table, you may satisfy yourself of his\r\nreligion, his politics, his taste, and indeed of his entire\r\ndisposition: for though a few odd fellows will utter their own\r\nsentiments in all places, yet much the greater part of mankind have\r\nenough of the courtier to accommodate their conversation to the taste\r\nand inclination of their superiors.\r\n\r\nBut to return to Mrs Wilkins, who, having executed her commission with\r\ngreat dispatch, though at fifteen miles distance, brought back such a\r\nconfirmation of the schoolmaster's guilt, that Mr Allworthy determined\r\nto send for the criminal, and examine him _viva voce_. Mr Partridge,\r\ntherefore, was summoned to attend, in order to his defence (if he\r\ncould make any) against this accusation.\r\n\r\nAt the time appointed, before Mr Allworthy himself, at Paradise-hall,\r\ncame as well the said Partridge, with Anne, his wife, as Mrs Wilkins\r\nhis accuser.\r\n\r\nAnd now Mr Allworthy being seated in the chair of justice, Mr\r\nPartridge was brought before him. Having heard his accusation from the\r\nmouth of Mrs Wilkins, he pleaded not guilty, making many vehement\r\nprotestations of his innocence.\r\n\r\nMrs Partridge was then examined, who, after a modest apology for being\r\nobliged to speak the truth against her husband, related all the\r\ncircumstances with which the reader hath already been acquainted; and\r\nat last concluded with her husband's confession of his guilt.\r\n\r\nWhether she had forgiven him or no, I will not venture to determine;\r\nbut it is certain she was an unwilling witness in this cause; and it\r\nis probable from certain other reasons, would never have been brought\r\nto depose as she did, had not Mrs Wilkins, with great art, fished all\r\nout of her at her own house, and had she not indeed made promises, in\r\nMr Allworthy's name, that the punishment of her husband should not be\r\nsuch as might anywise affect his family.\r\n\r\nPartridge still persisted in asserting his innocence, though he\r\nadmitted he had made the above-mentioned confession; which he however\r\nendeavoured to account for, by protesting that he was forced into it\r\nby the continued importunity she used: who vowed, that, as she was\r\nsure of his guilt, she would never leave tormenting him till he had\r\nowned it; and faithfully promised, that, in such case, she would never\r\nmention it to him more. Hence, he said, he had been induced falsely to\r\nconfess himself guilty, though he was innocent; and that he believed\r\nhe should have confest a murder from the same motive.\r\n\r\nMrs Partridge could not bear this imputation with patience; and having\r\nno other remedy in the present place but tears, she called forth a\r\nplentiful assistance from them, and then addressing herself to Mr\r\nAllworthy, she said (or rather cried), “May it please your worship,\r\nthere never was any poor woman so injured as I am by that base man;\r\nfor this is not the only instance of his falsehood to me. No, may it\r\nplease your worship, he hath injured my bed many's the good time and\r\noften. I could have put up with his drunkenness and neglect of his\r\nbusiness, if he had not broke one of the sacred commandments. Besides,\r\nif it had been out of doors I had not mattered it so much; but with my\r\nown servant, in my own house, under my own roof, to defile my own\r\nchaste bed, which to be sure he hath, with his beastly stinking\r\nwhores. Yes, you villain, you have defiled my own bed, you have; and\r\nthen you have charged me with bullocking you into owning the truth. It\r\nis very likely, an't please your worship, that I should bullock him? I\r\nhave marks enow about my body to show of his cruelty to me. If you had\r\nbeen a man, you villain, you would have scorned to injure a woman in\r\nthat manner. But you an't half a man, you know it. Nor have you been\r\nhalf a husband to me. You need run after whores, you need, when I'm\r\nsure--And since he provokes me, I am ready, an't please your worship,\r\nto take my bodily oath that I found them a-bed together. What, you\r\nhave forgot, I suppose, when you beat me into a fit, and made the\r\nblood run down my forehead, because I only civilly taxed you with\r\nadultery! but I can prove it by all my neighbours. You have almost\r\nbroke my heart, you have, you have.”\r\n\r\nHere Mr Allworthy interrupted, and begged her to be pacified,\r\npromising her that she should have justice; then turning to Partridge,\r\nwho stood aghast, one half of his wits being hurried away by surprize\r\nand the other half by fear, he said he was sorry to see there was so\r\nwicked a man in the world. He assured him that his prevaricating and\r\nlying backward and forward was a great aggravation of his guilt; for\r\nwhich the only atonement he could make was by confession and\r\nrepentance. He exhorted him, therefore, to begin by immediately\r\nconfessing the fact, and not to persist in denying what was so plainly\r\nproved against him even by his own wife.\r\n\r\nHere, reader, I beg your patience a moment, while I make a just\r\ncompliment to the great wisdom and sagacity of our law, which refuses\r\nto admit the evidence of a wife for or against her husband. This, says\r\na certain learned author, who, I believe, was never quoted before in\r\nany but a law-book, would be the means of creating an eternal\r\ndissension between them. It would, indeed, be the means of much\r\nperjury, and of much whipping, fining, imprisoning, transporting, and\r\nhanging.\r\n\r\nPartridge stood a while silent, till, being bid to speak, he said he\r\nhad already spoken the truth, and appealed to Heaven for his\r\ninnocence, and lastly to the girl herself, whom he desired his worship\r\nimmediately to send for; for he was ignorant, or at least pretended to\r\nbe so, that she had left that part of the country.\r\n\r\nMr Allworthy, whose natural love of justice, joined to his coolness of\r\ntemper, made him always a most patient magistrate in hearing all the\r\nwitnesses which an accused person could produce in his defence, agreed\r\nto defer his final determination of this matter till the arrival of\r\nJenny, for whom he immediately dispatched a messenger; and then having\r\nrecommended peace between Partridge and his wife (though he addressed\r\nhimself chiefly to the wrong person), he appointed them to attend\r\nagain the third day; for he had sent Jenny a whole day's journey from\r\nhis own house.\r\n\r\nAt the appointed time the parties all assembled, when the messenger\r\nreturning brought word, that Jenny was not to be found; for that she\r\nhad left her habitation a few days before, in company with a\r\nrecruiting officer.\r\n\r\nMr Allworthy then declared that the evidence of such a slut as she\r\nappeared to be would have deserved no credit; but he said he could not\r\nhelp thinking that, had she been present, and would have declared the\r\ntruth, she must have confirmed what so many circumstances, together\r\nwith his own confession, and the declaration of his wife that she had\r\ncaught her husband in the fact, did sufficiently prove. He therefore\r\nonce more exhorted Partridge to confess; but he still avowing his\r\ninnocence, Mr Allworthy declared himself satisfied of his guilt, and\r\nthat he was too bad a man to receive any encouragement from him. He\r\ntherefore deprived him of his annuity, and recommended repentance to\r\nhim on account of another world, and industry to maintain himself and\r\nhis wife in this.\r\n\r\nThere were not, perhaps, many more unhappy persons than poor\r\nPartridge. He had lost the best part of his income by the evidence of\r\nhis wife, and yet was daily upbraided by her for having, among other\r\nthings, been the occasion of depriving her of that benefit; but such\r\nwas his fortune, and he was obliged to submit to it.\r\n\r\nThough I called him poor Partridge in the last paragraph, I would have\r\nthe reader rather impute that epithet to the compassion in my temper\r\nthan conceive it to be any declaration of his innocence. Whether he\r\nwas innocent or not will perhaps appear hereafter; but if the historic\r\nmuse hath entrusted me with any secrets, I will by no means be guilty\r\nof discovering them till she shall give me leave.\r\n\r\nHere therefore the reader must suspend his curiosity. Certain it is\r\nthat, whatever was the truth of the case, there was evidence more than\r\nsufficient to convict him before Allworthy; indeed, much less would\r\nhave satisfied a bench of justices on an order of bastardy; and yet,\r\nnotwithstanding the positiveness of Mrs Partridge, who would have\r\ntaken the sacrament upon the matter, there is a possibility that the\r\nschoolmaster was entirely innocent: for though it appeared clear on\r\ncomparing the time when Jenny departed from Little Baddington with\r\nthat of her delivery that she had there conceived this infant, yet it\r\nby no means followed of necessity that Partridge must have been its\r\nfather; for, to omit other particulars, there was in the same house a\r\nlad near eighteen, between whom and Jenny there had subsisted\r\nsufficient intimacy to found a reasonable suspicion; and yet, so blind\r\nis jealousy, this circumstance never once entered into the head of the\r\nenraged wife.\r\n\r\nWhether Partridge repented or not, according to Mr Allworthy's advice,\r\nis not so apparent. Certain it is that his wife repented heartily of\r\nthe evidence she had given against him: especially when she found Mrs\r\nDeborah had deceived her, and refused to make any application to Mr\r\nAllworthy on her behalf. She had, however, somewhat better success\r\nwith Mrs Blifil, who was, as the reader must have perceived, a much\r\nbetter-tempered woman, and very kindly undertook to solicit her\r\nbrother to restore the annuity; in which, though good-nature might\r\nhave some share, yet a stronger and more natural motive will appear in\r\nthe next chapter.\r\n\r\nThese solicitations were nevertheless unsuccessful: for though Mr\r\nAllworthy did not think, with some late writers, that mercy consists\r\nonly in punishing offenders; yet he was as far from thinking that it\r\nis proper to this excellent quality to pardon great criminals\r\nwantonly, without any reason whatever. Any doubtfulness of the fact,\r\nor any circumstance of mitigation, was never disregarded: but the\r\npetitions of an offender, or the intercessions of others, did not in\r\nthe least affect him. In a word, he never pardoned because the\r\noffender himself, or his friends, were unwilling that he should be\r\npunished.\r\n\r\nPartridge and his wife were therefore both obliged to submit to their\r\nfate; which was indeed severe enough: for so far was he from doubling\r\nhis industry on the account of his lessened income, that he did in a\r\nmanner abandon himself to despair; and as he was by nature indolent,\r\nthat vice now increased upon him, by which means he lost the little\r\nschool he had; so that neither his wife nor himself would have had any\r\nbread to eat, had not the charity of some good Christian interposed,\r\nand provided them with what was just sufficient for their sustenance.\r\n\r\nAs this support was conveyed to them by an unknown hand, they\r\nimagined, and so, I doubt not, will the reader, that Mr Allworthy\r\nhimself was their secret benefactor; who, though he would not openly\r\nencourage vice, could yet privately relieve the distresses of the\r\nvicious themselves, when these became too exquisite and\r\ndisproportionate to their demerit. In which light their wretchedness\r\nappeared now to Fortune herself; for she at length took pity on this\r\nmiserable couple, and considerably lessened the wretched state of\r\nPartridge, by putting a final end to that of his wife, who soon after\r\ncaught the small-pox, and died.\r\n\r\nThe justice which Mr Allworthy had executed on Partridge at first met\r\nwith universal approbation; but no sooner had he felt its\r\nconsequences, than his neighbours began to relent, and to\r\ncompassionate his case; and presently after, to blame that as rigour\r\nand severity which they before called justice. They now exclaimed\r\nagainst punishing in cold blood, and sang forth the praises of mercy\r\nand forgiveness.\r\n\r\nThese cries were considerably increased by the death of Mrs Partridge,\r\nwhich, though owing to the distemper above mentioned, which is no\r\nconsequence of poverty or distress, many were not ashamed to impute to\r\nMr Allworthy's severity, or, as they now termed it, cruelty.\r\n\r\nPartridge having now lost his wife, his school, and his annuity, and\r\nthe unknown person having now discontinued the last-mentioned charity,\r\nresolved to change the scene, and left the country, where he was in\r\ndanger of starving, with the universal compassion of all his\r\nneighbours."

      "content": "A short sketch of that felicity which prudent couples may extract from\r\nhatred: with a short apology for those people who overlook\r\nimperfections in their friends.\r\n\nThough the captain had effectually demolished poor Partridge, yet had\r\nhe not reaped the harvest he hoped for, which was to turn the\r\nfoundling out of Mr Allworthy's house.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, that gentleman grew every day fonder of little Tommy,\r\nas if he intended to counterbalance his severity to the father with\r\nextraordinary fondness and affection towards the son.\r\n\r\nThis a good deal soured the captain's temper, as did all the other\r\ndaily instances of Mr Allworthy's generosity; for he looked on all\r\nsuch largesses to be diminutions of his own wealth.\r\n\r\nIn this, we have said, he did not agree with his wife; nor, indeed, in\r\nanything else: for though an affection placed on the understanding is,\r\nby many wise persons, thought more durable than that which is founded\r\non beauty, yet it happened otherwise in the present case. Nay, the\r\nunderstandings of this couple were their principal bone of contention,\r\nand one great cause of many quarrels, which from time to time arose\r\nbetween them; and which at last ended, on the side of the lady, in a\r\nsovereign contempt for her husband; and on the husband's, in an utter\r\nabhorrence of his wife.\r\n\r\nAs these had both exercised their talents chiefly in the study of\r\ndivinity, this was, from their first acquaintance, the most common\r\ntopic of conversation between them. The captain, like a well-bred man,\r\nhad, before marriage, always given up his opinion to that of the lady;\r\nand this, not in the clumsy awkward manner of a conceited blockhead,\r\nwho, while he civilly yields to a superior in an argument, is desirous\r\nof being still known to think himself in the right. The captain, on\r\nthe contrary, though one of the proudest fellows in the world, so\r\nabsolutely yielded the victory to his antagonist, that she, who had\r\nnot the least doubt of his sincerity, retired always from the dispute\r\nwith an admiration of her own understanding and a love for his.\r\n\r\nBut though this complacence to one whom the captain thoroughly\r\ndespised, was not so uneasy to him as it would have been had any hopes\r\nof preferment made it necessary to show the same submission to a\r\nHoadley, or to some other of great reputation in the science, yet even\r\nthis cost him too much to be endured without some motive. Matrimony,\r\ntherefore, having removed all such motives, he grew weary of this\r\ncondescension, and began to treat the opinions of his wife with that\r\nhaughtiness and insolence, which none but those who deserve some\r\ncontempt themselves can bestow, and those only who deserve no contempt\r\ncan bear.\r\n\r\nWhen the first torrent of tenderness was over, and when, in the calm\r\nand long interval between the fits, reason began to open the eyes of\r\nthe lady, and she saw this alteration of behaviour in the captain, who\r\nat length answered all her arguments only with pish and pshaw, she was\r\nfar from enduring the indignity with a tame submission. Indeed, it at\r\nfirst so highly provoked her, that it might have produced some\r\ntragical event, had it not taken a more harmless turn, by filling her\r\nwith the utmost contempt for her husband's understanding, which\r\nsomewhat qualified her hatred towards him; though of this likewise she\r\nhad a pretty moderate share.\r\n\r\nThe captain's hatred to her was of a purer kind: for as to any\r\nimperfections in her knowledge or understanding, he no more despised\r\nher for them, than for her not being six feet high. In his opinion of\r\nthe female sex, he exceeded the moroseness of Aristotle himself: he\r\nlooked on a woman as on an animal of domestic use, of somewhat higher\r\nconsideration than a cat, since her offices were of rather more\r\nimportance; but the difference between these two was, in his\r\nestimation, so small, that, in his marriage contracted with Mr\r\nAllworthy's lands and tenements, it would have been pretty equal which\r\nof them he had taken into the bargain. And yet so tender was his\r\npride, that it felt the contempt which his wife now began to express\r\ntowards him; and this, added to the surfeit he had before taken of her\r\nlove, created in him a degree of disgust and abhorrence, perhaps\r\nhardly to be exceeded.\r\n\r\nOne situation only of the married state is excluded from pleasure: and\r\nthat is, a state of indifference: but as many of my readers, I hope,\r\nknow what an exquisite delight there is in conveying pleasure to a\r\nbeloved object, so some few, I am afraid, may have experienced the\r\nsatisfaction of tormenting one we hate. It is, I apprehend, to come at\r\nthis latter pleasure, that we see both sexes often give up that ease\r\nin marriage which they might otherwise possess, though their mate was\r\nnever so disagreeable to them. Hence the wife often puts on fits of\r\nlove and jealousy, nay, even denies herself any pleasure, to disturb\r\nand prevent those of her husband; and he again, in return, puts\r\nfrequent restraints on himself, and stays at home in company which he\r\ndislikes, in order to confine his wife to what she equally detests.\r\nHence, too, must flow those tears which a widow sometimes so\r\nplentifully sheds over the ashes of a husband with whom she led a life\r\nof constant disquiet and turbulency, and whom now she can never hope\r\nto torment any more.\r\n\r\nBut if ever any couple enjoyed this pleasure, it was at present\r\nexperienced by the captain and his lady. It was always a sufficient\r\nreason to either of them to be obstinate in any opinion, that the\r\nother had previously asserted the contrary. If the one proposed any\r\namusement, the other constantly objected to it: they never loved or\r\nhated, commended or abused, the same person. And for this reason, as\r\nthe captain looked with an evil eye on the little foundling, his wife\r\nbegan now to caress it almost equally with her own child.\r\n\r\nThe reader will be apt to conceive, that this behaviour between the\r\nhusband and wife did not greatly contribute to Mr Allworthy's repose,\r\nas it tended so little to that serene happiness which he had designed\r\nfor all three from this alliance; but the truth is, though he might be\r\na little disappointed in his sanguine expectations, yet he was far\r\nfrom being acquainted with the whole matter; for, as the captain was,\r\nfrom certain obvious reasons, much on his guard before him, the lady\r\nwas obliged, for fear of her brother's displeasure, to pursue the same\r\nconduct. In fact, it is possible for a third person to be very\r\nintimate, nay even to live long in the same house, with a married\r\ncouple, who have any tolerable discretion, and not even guess at the\r\nsour sentiments which they bear to each other: for though the whole\r\nday may be sometimes too short for hatred, as well as for love; yet\r\nthe many hours which they naturally spend together, apart from all\r\nobservers, furnish people of tolerable moderation with such ample\r\nopportunity for the enjoyment of either passion, that, if they love,\r\nthey can support being a few hours in company without toying, or if\r\nthey hate, without spitting in each other's faces.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, however, that Mr Allworthy saw enough to render him a\r\nlittle uneasy; for we are not always to conclude, that a wise man is\r\nnot hurt, because he doth not cry out and lament himself, like those\r\nof a childish or effeminate temper. But indeed it is possible he might\r\nsee some faults in the captain without any uneasiness at all; for men\r\nof true wisdom and goodness are contented to take persons and things\r\nas they are, without complaining of their imperfections, or attempting\r\nto amend them. They can see a fault in a friend, a relation, or an\r\nacquaintance, without ever mentioning it to the parties themselves, or\r\nto any others; and this often without lessening their affection.\r\nIndeed, unless great discernment be tempered with this overlooking\r\ndisposition, we ought never to contract friendship but with a degree\r\nof folly which we can deceive; for I hope my friends will pardon me\r\nwhen I declare, I know none of them without a fault; and I should be\r\nsorry if I could imagine I had any friend who could not see mine.\r\nForgiveness of this kind we give and demand in turn. It is an exercise\r\nof friendship, and perhaps none of the least pleasant. And this\r\nforgiveness we must bestow, without desire of amendment. There is,\r\nperhaps, no surer mark of folly, than an attempt to correct the\r\nnatural infirmities of those we love. The finest composition of human\r\nnature, as well as the finest china, may have a flaw in it; and this,\r\nI am afraid, in either case, is equally incurable; though,\r\nnevertheless, the pattern may remain of the highest value.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, then, Mr Allworthy certainly saw some imperfections in\r\nthe captain; but as this was a very artful man, and eternally upon his\r\nguard before him, these appeared to him no more than blemishes in a\r\ngood character, which his goodness made him overlook, and his wisdom\r\nprevented him from discovering to the captain himself. Very different\r\nwould have been his sentiments had he discovered the whole; which\r\nperhaps would in time have been the case, had the husband and wife\r\nlong continued this kind of behaviour to each other; but this kind\r\nFortune took effectual means to prevent, by forcing the captain to do\r\nthat which rendered him again dear to his wife, and restored all her\r\ntenderness and affection towards him."

      "content": "A receipt to regain the lost affections of a wife, which hath never\r\nbeen known to fail in the most desperate cases.\r\n\nThe captain was made large amends for the unpleasant minutes which he\r\npassed in the conversation of his wife (and which were as few as he\r\ncould contrive to make them), by the pleasant meditations he enjoyed\r\nwhen alone.\r\n\r\nThese meditations were entirely employed on Mr Allworthy's fortune;\r\nfor, first, he exercised much thought in calculating, as well as he\r\ncould, the exact value of the whole: which calculations he often saw\r\noccasion to alter in his own favour: and, secondly and chiefly, he\r\npleased himself with intended alterations in the house and gardens,\r\nand in projecting many other schemes, as well for the improvement of\r\nthe estate as of the grandeur of the place: for this purpose he\r\napplied himself to the studies of architecture and gardening, and read\r\nover many books on both these subjects; for these sciences, indeed,\r\nemployed his whole time, and formed his only amusement. He at last\r\ncompleted a most excellent plan: and very sorry we are, that it is not\r\nin our power to present it to our reader, since even the luxury of the\r\npresent age, I believe, would hardly match it. It had, indeed, in a\r\nsuperlative degree, the two principal ingredients which serve to\r\nrecommend all great and noble designs of this nature; for it required\r\nan immoderate expense to execute, and a vast length of time to bring\r\nit to any sort of perfection. The former of these, the immense wealth\r\nof which the captain supposed Mr Allworthy possessed, and which he\r\nthought himself sure of inheriting, promised very effectually to\r\nsupply; and the latter, the soundness of his own constitution, and his\r\ntime of life, which was only what is called middle-age, removed all\r\napprehension of his not living to accomplish.\r\n\r\nNothing was wanting to enable him to enter upon the immediate\r\nexecution of this plan, but the death of Mr Allworthy; in calculating\r\nwhich he had employed much of his own algebra, besides purchasing\r\nevery book extant that treats of the value of lives, reversions, &c.\r\nFrom all which he satisfied himself, that as he had every day a chance\r\nof this happening, so had he more than an even chance of its happening\r\nwithin a few years.\r\n\r\nBut while the captain was one day busied in deep contemplations of\r\nthis kind, one of the most unlucky as well as unseasonable accidents\r\nhappened to him. The utmost malice of Fortune could, indeed, have\r\ncontrived nothing so cruel, so mal-a-propos, so absolutely destructive\r\nto all his schemes. In short, not to keep the reader in long suspense,\r\njust at the very instant when his heart was exulting in meditations on\r\nthe happiness which would accrue to him by Mr Allworthy's death, he\r\nhimself--died of an apoplexy.\r\n\r\nThis unfortunately befel the captain as he was taking his evening walk\r\nby himself, so that nobody was present to lend him any assistance, if\r\nindeed, any assistance could have preserved him. He took, therefore,\r\nmeasure of that proportion of soil which was now become adequate to\r\nall his future purposes, and he lay dead on the ground, a great\r\n(though not a living) example of the truth of that observation of\r\nHorace:\r\n\r\n _Tu secanda marmora\r\n Locas sub ipsum funus; et sepulchri\r\n Immemor, struis domos._\r\n\r\nWhich sentiment I shall thus give to the English reader: “You provide\r\nthe noblest materials for building, when a pickaxe and a spade are\r\nonly necessary: and build houses of five hundred by a hundred feet,\r\nforgetting that of six by two.”"

      "content": "A proof of the infallibility of the foregoing receipt, in the\r\nlamentations of the widow; with other suitable decorations of death,\r\nsuch as physicians, &c., and an epitaph in the true stile.\r\n\nMr Allworthy, his sister, and another lady, were assembled at the\r\naccustomed hour in the supper-room, where, having waited a\r\nconsiderable time longer than usual, Mr Allworthy first declared he\r\nbegan to grow uneasy at the captain's stay (for he was always most\r\npunctual at his meals); and gave orders that the bell should be rung\r\nwithout the doors, and especially towards those walks which the\r\ncaptain was wont to use.\r\n\r\nAll these summons proving ineffectual (for the captain had, by\r\nperverse accident, betaken himself to a new walk that evening), Mrs\r\nBlifil declared she was seriously frightened. Upon which the other\r\nlady, who was one of her most intimate acquaintance, and who well knew\r\nthe true state of her affections, endeavoured all she could to pacify\r\nher, telling her--To be sure she could not help being uneasy; but that\r\nshe should hope the best. That, perhaps the sweetness of the evening\r\nhad inticed the captain to go farther than his usual walk: or he might\r\nbe detained at some neighbour's. Mrs Blifil answered, No; she was sure\r\nsome accident had befallen him; for that he would never stay out\r\nwithout sending her word, as he must know how uneasy it would make\r\nher. The other lady, having no other arguments to use, betook herself\r\nto the entreaties usual on such occasions, and begged her not to\r\nfrighten herself, for it might be of very ill consequence to her own\r\nhealth; and, filling out a very large glass of wine, advised, and at\r\nlast prevailed with her to drink it.\r\n\r\nMr Allworthy now returned into the parlour; for he had been himself in\r\nsearch after the captain. His countenance sufficiently showed the\r\nconsternation he was under, which, indeed, had a good deal deprived\r\nhim of speech; but as grief operates variously on different minds, so\r\nthe same apprehension which depressed his voice, elevated that of Mrs\r\nBlifil. She now began to bewail herself in very bitter terms, and\r\nfloods of tears accompanied her lamentations; which the lady, her\r\ncompanion, declared she could not blame, but at the same time\r\ndissuaded her from indulging; attempting to moderate the grief of her\r\nfriend by philosophical observations on the many disappointments to\r\nwhich human life is daily subject, which, she said, was a sufficient\r\nconsideration to fortify our minds against any accidents, how sudden\r\nor terrible soever. She said her brother's example ought to teach her\r\npatience, who, though indeed he could not be supposed as much\r\nconcerned as herself, yet was, doubtless, very uneasy, though his\r\nresignation to the Divine will had restrained his grief within due\r\nbounds.\r\n\r\n“Mention not my brother,” said Mrs Blifil; “I alone am the object of\r\nyour pity. What are the terrors of friendship to what a wife feels on\r\nthese occasions? Oh, he is lost! Somebody hath murdered him--I shall\r\nnever see him more!”--Here a torrent of tears had the same consequence\r\nwith what the suppression had occasioned to Mr Allworthy, and she\r\nremained silent.\r\n\r\nAt this interval a servant came running in, out of breath, and cried\r\nout, The captain was found; and, before he could proceed farther, he\r\nwas followed by two more, bearing the dead body between them.\r\n\r\nHere the curious reader may observe another diversity in the\r\noperations of grief: for as Mr Allworthy had been before silent, from\r\nthe same cause which had made his sister vociferous; so did the\r\npresent sight, which drew tears from the gentleman, put an entire stop\r\nto those of the lady; who first gave a violent scream, and presently\r\nafter fell into a fit.\r\n\r\nThe room was soon full of servants, some of whom, with the lady\r\nvisitant, were employed in care of the wife; and others, with Mr\r\nAllworthy, assisted in carrying off the captain to a warm bed; where\r\nevery method was tried, in order to restore him to life.\r\n\r\nAnd glad should we be, could we inform the reader that both these\r\nbodies had been attended with equal success; for those who undertook\r\nthe care of the lady succeeded so well, that, after the fit had\r\ncontinued a decent time, she again revived, to their great\r\nsatisfaction: but as to the captain, all experiments of bleeding,\r\nchafing, dropping, &c., proved ineffectual. Death, that inexorable\r\njudge, had passed sentence on him, and refused to grant him a\r\nreprieve, though two doctors who arrived, and were fee'd at one and\r\nthe same instant, were his counsel.\r\n\r\nThese two doctors, whom, to avoid any malicious applications, we shall\r\ndistinguish by the names of Dr Y. and Dr Z., having felt his pulse; to\r\nwit, Dr Y. his right arm, and Dr Z. his left; both agreed that he was\r\nabsolutely dead; but as to the distemper, or cause of his death, they\r\ndiffered; Dr Y. holding that he died of an apoplexy, and Dr Z. of an\r\nepilepsy.\r\n\r\nHence arose a dispute between the learned men, in which each delivered\r\nthe reasons of their several opinions. These were of such equal force,\r\nthat they served both to confirm either doctor in his own sentiments,\r\nand made not the least impression on his adversary.\r\n\r\nTo say the truth, every physician almost hath his favourite disease,\r\nto which he ascribes all the victories obtained over human nature. The\r\ngout, the rheumatism, the stone, the gravel, and the consumption, have\r\nall their several patrons in the faculty; and none more than the\r\nnervous fever, or the fever on the spirits. And here we may account\r\nfor those disagreements in opinion, concerning the cause of a\r\npatient's death, which sometimes occur, between the most learned of\r\nthe college; and which have greatly surprized that part of the world\r\nwho have been ignorant of the fact we have above asserted.\r\n\r\nThe reader may perhaps be surprized, that, instead of endeavouring to\r\nrevive the patient, the learned gentlemen should fall immediately into\r\na dispute on the occasion of his death; but in reality all such\r\nexperiments had been made before their arrival: for the captain was\r\nput into a warm bed, had his veins scarified, his forehead chafed, and\r\nall sorts of strong drops applied to his lips and nostrils.\r\n\r\nThe physicians, therefore, finding themselves anticipated in\r\neverything they ordered, were at a loss how to apply that portion of\r\ntime which it is usual and decent to remain for their fee, and were\r\ntherefore necessitated to find some subject or other for discourse;\r\nand what could more naturally present itself than that before\r\nmentioned?\r\n\r\nOur doctors were about to take their leave, when Mr Allworthy, having\r\ngiven over the captain, and acquiesced in the Divine will, began to\r\nenquire after his sister, whom he desired them to visit before their\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\nThis lady was now recovered of her fit, and, to use the common phrase,\r\nas well as could be expected for one in her condition. The doctors,\r\ntherefore, all previous ceremonies being complied with, as this was a\r\nnew patient, attended, according to desire, and laid hold on each of\r\nher hands, as they had before done on those of the corpse.\r\n\r\nThe case of the lady was in the other extreme from that of her\r\nhusband: for as he was past all the assistance of physic, so in\r\nreality she required none.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more unjust than the vulgar opinion, by which\r\nphysicians are misrepresented, as friends to death. On the contrary, I\r\nbelieve, if the number of those who recover by physic could be opposed\r\nto that of the martyrs to it, the former would rather exceed the\r\nlatter. Nay, some are so cautious on this head, that, to avoid a\r\npossibility of killing the patient, they abstain from all methods of\r\ncuring, and prescribe nothing but what can neither do good nor harm. I\r\nhave heard some of these, with great gravity, deliver it as a maxim,\r\n“That Nature should be left to do her own work, while the physician\r\nstands by as it were to clap her on the back, and encourage her when\r\nshe doth well.”\r\n\r\nSo little then did our doctors delight in death, that they discharged\r\nthe corpse after a single fee; but they were not so disgusted with\r\ntheir living patient; concerning whose case they immediately agreed,\r\nand fell to prescribing with great diligence.\r\n\r\nWhether, as the lady had at first persuaded her physicians to believe\r\nher ill, they had now, in return, persuaded her to believe herself so,\r\nI will not determine; but she continued a whole month with all the\r\ndecorations of sickness. During this time she was visited by\r\nphysicians, attended by nurses, and received constant messages from\r\nher acquaintance to enquire after her health.\r\n\r\nAt length the decent time for sickness and immoderate grief being\r\nexpired, the doctors were discharged, and the lady began to see\r\ncompany; being altered only from what she was before, by that colour\r\nof sadness in which she had dressed her person and countenance.\r\n\r\nThe captain was now interred, and might, perhaps, have already made a\r\nlarge progress towards oblivion, had not the friendship of Mr\r\nAllworthy taken care to preserve his memory, by the following epitaph,\r\nwhich was written by a man of as great genius as integrity, and one\r\nwho perfectly well knew the captain.\r\n\r\n HERE LIES,\r\n IN EXPECTATION OF A JOYFUL RISING,\r\n THE BODY OF\r\n\r\n CAPTAIN JOHN BLIFIL.\r\n\r\n LONDON\r\n HAD THE HONOUR OF HIS BIRTH,\r\n OXFORD\r\n OF HIS EDUCATION.\r\n\r\n HIS PARTS\r\n WERE AN HONOUR TO HIS PROFESSION\r\n AND TO HIS COUNTRY:\r\n HIS LIFE, TO HIS RELIGION\r\n AND HUMAN NATURE.\r\n HE WAS A DUTIFUL SON,\r\n A TENDER HUSBAND,\r\n AN AFFECTIONATE FATHER,\r\n A MOST KIND BROTHER,\r\n A SINCERE FRIEND,\r\n A DEVOUT CHRISTIAN,\r\n AND A GOOD MAN.\r\n\r\n HIS INCONSOLABLE WIDOW\r\n HATH ERECTED THIS STONE,\r\n THE MONUMENT OF\r\n HIS VIRTUES\r\n AND OF HER AFFECTION.\r\n\nBOOK III.\r\n\r\nCONTAINING THE MOST MEMORABLE TRANSACTIONS WHICH PASSED IN THE FAMILY\r\nOF MR ALLWORTHY, FROM THE TIME WHEN TOMMY JONES ARRIVED AT THE AGE OF\r\nFOURTEEN, TILL HE ATTAINED THE AGE OF NINETEEN.

      "content": "Containing little or nothing.\r\n\nThe reader will be pleased to remember, that, at the beginning of the\r\nsecond book of this history, we gave him a hint of our intention to\r\npass over several large periods of time, in which nothing happened\r\nworthy of being recorded in a chronicle of this kind.\r\n\r\nIn so doing, we do not only consult our own dignity and ease, but the\r\ngood and advantage of the reader: for besides that by these means we\r\nprevent him from throwing away his time, in reading without either\r\npleasure or emolument, we give him, at all such seasons, an\r\nopportunity of employing that wonderful sagacity, of which he is\r\nmaster, by filling up these vacant spaces of time with his own\r\nconjectures; for which purpose we have taken care to qualify him in\r\nthe preceding pages.\r\n\r\nFor instance, what reader but knows that Mr Allworthy felt, at first,\r\nfor the loss of his friend, those emotions of grief, which on such\r\noccasions enter into all men whose hearts are not composed of flint,\r\nor their heads of as solid materials? Again, what reader doth not know\r\nthat philosophy and religion in time moderated, and at last\r\nextinguished, this grief? The former of these teaching the folly and\r\nvanity of it, and the latter correcting it as unlawful, and at the\r\nsame time assuaging it, by raising future hopes and assurances, which\r\nenable a strong and religious mind to take leave of a friend, on his\r\ndeathbed, with little less indifference than if he was preparing for a\r\nlong journey; and, indeed, with little less hope of seeing him again.\r\n\r\nNor can the judicious reader be at a greater loss on account of Mrs\r\nBridget Blifil, who, he may be assured, conducted herself through the\r\nwhole season in which grief is to make its appearance on the outside\r\nof the body, with the strictest regard to all the rules of custom and\r\ndecency, suiting the alterations of her countenance to the several\r\nalterations of her habit: for as this changed from weeds to black,\r\nfrom black to grey, from grey to white, so did her countenance change\r\nfrom dismal to sorrowful, from sorrowful to sad, and from sad to\r\nserious, till the day came in which she was allowed to return to her\r\nformer serenity.\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned these two, as examples only of the task which may be\r\nimposed on readers of the lowest class. Much higher and harder\r\nexercises of judgment and penetration may reasonably be expected from\r\nthe upper graduates in criticism. Many notable discoveries will, I\r\ndoubt not, be made by such, of the transactions which happened in the\r\nfamily of our worthy man, during all the years which we have thought\r\nproper to pass over: for though nothing worthy of a place in this\r\nhistory occurred within that period, yet did several incidents happen\r\nof equal importance with those reported by the daily and weekly\r\nhistorians of the age; in reading which great numbers of persons\r\nconsume a considerable part of their time, very little, I am afraid,\r\nto their emolument. Now, in the conjectures here proposed, some of the\r\nmost excellent faculties of the mind may be employed to much\r\nadvantage, since it is a more useful capacity to be able to foretel\r\nthe actions of men, in any circumstance, from their characters, than\r\nto judge of their characters from their actions. The former, I own,\r\nrequires the greater penetration; but may be accomplished by true\r\nsagacity with no less certainty than the latter.\r\n\r\nAs we are sensible that much the greatest part of our readers are very\r\neminently possessed of this quality, we have left them a space of\r\ntwelve years to exert it in; and shall now bring forth our heroe, at\r\nabout fourteen years of age, not questioning that many have been long\r\nimpatient to be introduced to his acquaintance."

      "content": "The heroe of this great history appears with very bad omens. A little\r\ntale of so LOW a kind that some may think it not worth their notice. A\r\nword or two concerning a squire, and more relating to a gamekeeper and\r\na schoolmaster.\r\n\r\nAs we determined, when we first sat down to write this history, to\r\nflatter no man, but to guide our pen throughout by the directions of\r\ntruth, we are obliged to bring our heroe on the stage in a much more\r\ndisadvantageous manner than we could wish; and to declare honestly,\r\neven at his first appearance, that it was the universal opinion of all\r\nMr Allworthy's family that he was certainly born to be hanged.\r\n\r\nIndeed, I am sorry to say there was too much reason for this\r\nconjecture; the lad having from his earliest years discovered a\r\npropensity to many vices, and especially to one which hath as direct a\r\ntendency as any other to that fate which we have just now observed to\r\nhave been prophetically denounced against him: he had been already\r\nconvicted of three robberies, viz., of robbing an orchard, of stealing\r\na duck out of a farmer's yard, and of picking Master Blifil's pocket\r\nof a ball.\r\n\r\nThe vices of this young man were, moreover, heightened by the\r\ndisadvantageous light in which they appeared when opposed to the\r\nvirtues of Master Blifil, his companion; a youth of so different a\r\ncast from little Jones, that not only the family but all the\r\nneighbourhood resounded his praises. He was, indeed, a lad of a\r\nremarkable disposition; sober, discreet, and pious beyond his age;\r\nqualities which gained him the love of every one who knew him: while\r\nTom Jones was universally disliked; and many expressed their wonder\r\nthat Mr Allworthy would suffer such a lad to be educated with his\r\nnephew, lest the morals of the latter should be corrupted by his\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nAn incident which happened about this time will set the characters of\r\nthese two lads more fairly before the discerning reader than is in the\r\npower of the longest dissertation.\r\n\r\nTom Jones, who, bad as he is, must serve for the heroe of this\r\nhistory, had only one friend among all the servants of the family; for\r\nas to Mrs Wilkins, she had long since given him up, and was perfectly\r\nreconciled to her mistress. This friend was the gamekeeper, a fellow\r\nof a loose kind of disposition, and who was thought not to entertain\r\nmuch stricter notions concerning the difference of _meum_ and _tuum_\r\nthan the young gentleman himself. And hence this friendship gave\r\noccasion to many sarcastical remarks among the domestics, most of\r\nwhich were either proverbs before, or at least are become so now; and,\r\nindeed, the wit of them all may be comprised in that short Latin\r\nproverb, “_Noscitur a socio;_” which, I think, is thus expressed in\r\nEnglish, “You may know him by the company he keeps.”\r\n\r\nTo say the truth, some of that atrocious wickedness in Jones, of which\r\nwe have just mentioned three examples, might perhaps be derived from\r\nthe encouragement he had received from this fellow, who, in two or\r\nthree instances, had been what the law calls an accessary after the\r\nfact: for the whole duck, and great part of the apples, were converted\r\nto the use of the gamekeeper and his family; though, as Jones alone\r\nwas discovered, the poor lad bore not only the whole smart, but the\r\nwhole blame; both which fell again to his lot on the following\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nContiguous to Mr Allworthy's estate was the manor of one of those\r\ngentlemen who are called preservers of the game. This species of men,\r\nfrom the great severity with which they revenge the death of a hare or\r\npartridge, might be thought to cultivate the same superstition with\r\nthe Bannians in India; many of whom, we are told, dedicate their whole\r\nlives to the preservation and protection of certain animals; was it\r\nnot that our English Bannians, while they preserve them from other\r\nenemies, will most unmercifully slaughter whole horse-loads\r\nthemselves; so that they stand clearly acquitted of any such\r\nheathenish superstition.\r\n\r\nI have, indeed, a much better opinion of this kind of men than is\r\nentertained by some, as I take them to answer the order of Nature, and\r\nthe good purposes for which they were ordained, in a more ample manner\r\nthan many others. Now, as Horace tells us that there are a set of\r\nhuman beings\r\n\r\n _Fruges consumere nati,_\r\n\r\n“Born to consume the fruits of the earth;” so I make no manner of\r\ndoubt but that there are others\r\n\r\n _Feras consumere nati,_\r\n\r\n“Born to consume the beasts of the field;” or, as it is commonly\r\ncalled, the game; and none, I believe, will deny but that those\r\nsquires fulfil this end of their creation.\r\n\r\nLittle Jones went one day a shooting with the gamekeeper; when\r\nhappening to spring a covey of partridges near the border of that\r\nmanor over which Fortune, to fulfil the wise purposes of Nature, had\r\nplanted one of the game consumers, the birds flew into it, and were\r\nmarked (as it is called) by the two sportsmen, in some furze bushes,\r\nabout two or three hundred paces beyond Mr Allworthy's dominions.\r\n\r\nMr Allworthy had given the fellow strict orders, on pain of forfeiting\r\nhis place, never to trespass on any of his neighbours; no more on\r\nthose who were less rigid in this matter than on the lord of this\r\nmanor. With regard to others, indeed, these orders had not been always\r\nvery scrupulously kept; but as the disposition of the gentleman with\r\nwhom the partridges had taken sanctuary was well known, the gamekeeper\r\nhad never yet attempted to invade his territories. Nor had he done it\r\nnow, had not the younger sportsman, who was excessively eager to\r\npursue the flying game, over-persuaded him; but Jones being very\r\nimportunate, the other, who was himself keen enough after the sport,\r\nyielded to his persuasions, entered the manor, and shot one of the\r\npartridges.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman himself was at that time on horse-back, at a little\r\ndistance from them; and hearing the gun go off, he immediately made\r\ntowards the place, and discovered poor Tom; for the gamekeeper had\r\nleapt into the thickest part of the furze-brake, where he had happily\r\nconcealed himself.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman having searched the lad, and found the partridge upon\r\nhim, denounced great vengeance, swearing he would acquaint Mr\r\nAllworthy. He was as good as his word: for he rode immediately to his\r\nhouse, and complained of the trespass on his manor in as high terms\r\nand as bitter language as if his house had been broken open, and the\r\nmost valuable furniture stole out of it. He added, that some other\r\nperson was in his company, though he could not discover him; for that\r\ntwo guns had been discharged almost in the same instant. And, says he,\r\n“We have found only this partridge, but the Lord knows what mischief\r\nthey have done.”\r\n\r\nAt his return home, Tom was presently convened before Mr Allworthy. He\r\nowned the fact, and alledged no other excuse but what was really true,\r\nviz., that the covey was originally sprung in Mr Allworthy's own\r\nmanor.\r\n\r\nTom was then interrogated who was with him, which Mr Allworthy\r\ndeclared he was resolved to know, acquainting the culprit with the\r\ncircumstance of the two guns, which had been deposed by the squire and\r\nboth his servants; but Tom stoutly persisted in asserting that he was\r\nalone; yet, to say the truth, he hesitated a little at first, which\r\nwould have confirmed Mr Allworthy's belief, had what the squire and\r\nhis servants said wanted any further confirmation.\r\n\r\nThe gamekeeper, being a suspected person, was now sent for, and the\r\nquestion put to him; but he, relying on the promise which Tom had made\r\nhim, to take all upon himself, very resolutely denied being in company\r\nwith the young gentleman, or indeed having seen him the whole\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nMr Allworthy then turned towards Tom, with more than usual anger in\r\nhis countenance, and advised him to confess who was with him;\r\nrepeating, that he was resolved to know. The lad, however, still\r\nmaintained his resolution, and was dismissed with much wrath by Mr\r\nAllworthy, who told him he should have to the next morning to consider\r\nof it, when he should be questioned by another person, and in another\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nPoor Jones spent a very melancholy night; and the more so, as he was\r\nwithout his usual companion; for Master Blifil was gone abroad on a\r\nvisit with his mother. Fear of the punishment he was to suffer was on\r\nthis occasion his least evil; his chief anxiety being, lest his\r\nconstancy should fail him, and he should be brought to betray the\r\ngamekeeper, whose ruin he knew must now be the consequence.\r\n\r\nNor did the gamekeeper pass his time much better. He had the same\r\napprehensions with the youth; for whose honour he had likewise a much\r\ntenderer regard than for his skin.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, when Tom attended the reverend Mr Thwackum, the person\r\nto whom Mr Allworthy had committed the instruction of the two boys, he\r\nhad the same questions put to him by that gentleman which he had been\r\nasked the evening before, to which he returned the same answers. The\r\nconsequence of this was, so severe a whipping, that it possibly fell\r\nlittle short of the torture with which confessions are in some\r\ncountries extorted from criminals.\r\n\r\nTom bore his punishment with great resolution; and though his master\r\nasked him, between every stroke, whether he would not confess, he was\r\ncontented to be flead rather than betray his friend, or break the\r\npromise he had made.\r\n\r\nThe gamekeeper was now relieved from his anxiety, and Mr Allworthy\r\nhimself began to be concerned at Tom's sufferings: for besides that Mr\r\nThwackum, being highly enraged that he was not able to make the boy\r\nsay what he himself pleased, had carried his severity much beyond the\r\ngood man's intention, this latter began now to suspect that the squire\r\nhad been mistaken; which his extreme eagerness and anger seemed to\r\nmake probable; and as for what the servants had said in confirmation\r\nof their master's account, he laid no great stress upon that. Now, as\r\ncruelty and injustice were two ideas of which Mr Allworthy could by no\r\nmeans support the consciousness a single moment, he sent for Tom, and\r\nafter many kind and friendly exhortations, said, “I am convinced, my\r\ndear child, that my suspicions have wronged you; I am sorry that you\r\nhave been so severely punished on this account.” And at last gave him\r\na little horse to make him amends; again repeating his sorrow for what\r\nhad past.\r\n\r\nTom's guilt now flew in his face more than any severity could make it.\r\nHe could more easily bear the lashes of Thwackum, than the generosity\r\nof Allworthy. The tears burst from his eyes, and he fell upon his\r\nknees, crying, “Oh, sir, you are too good to me. Indeed you are.\r\nIndeed I don't deserve it.” And at that very instant, from the fulness\r\nof his heart, had almost betrayed the secret; but the good genius of\r\nthe gamekeeper suggested to him what might be the consequence to the\r\npoor fellow, and this consideration sealed his lips.\r\n\r\nThwackum did all he could to persuade Allworthy from showing any\r\ncompassion or kindness to the boy, saying, “He had persisted in an\r\nuntruth;” and gave some hints, that a second whipping might probably\r\nbring the matter to light.\r\n\r\nBut Mr Allworthy absolutely refused to consent to the experiment. He\r\nsaid, the boy had suffered enough already for concealing the truth,\r\neven if he was guilty, seeing that he could have no motive but a\r\nmistaken point of honour for so doing.\r\n\r\n“Honour!” cryed Thwackum, with some warmth, “mere stubbornness and\r\nobstinacy! Can honour teach any one to tell a lie, or can any honour\r\nexist independent of religion?”\r\n\r\nThis discourse happened at table when dinner was just ended; and there\r\nwere present Mr Allworthy, Mr Thwackum, and a third gentleman, who now\r\nentered into the debate, and whom, before we proceed any further, we\r\nshall briefly introduce to our reader's acquaintance."

      "content": "The character of Mr Square the philosopher, and of Mr Thwackum the\r\ndivine; with a dispute concerning----\r\n\nThe name of this gentleman, who had then resided some time at Mr\r\nAllworthy's house, was Mr Square. His natural parts were not of the\r\nfirst rate, but he had greatly improved them by a learned education.\r\nHe was deeply read in the antients, and a profest master of all the\r\nworks of Plato and Aristotle. Upon which great models he had\r\nprincipally formed himself; sometimes according with the opinion of\r\nthe one, and sometimes with that of the other. In morals he was a\r\nprofest Platonist, and in religion he inclined to be an Aristotelian.\r\n\r\nBut though he had, as we have said, formed his morals on the Platonic\r\nmodel, yet he perfectly agreed with the opinion of Aristotle, in\r\nconsidering that great man rather in the quality of a philosopher or a\r\nspeculatist, than as a legislator. This sentiment he carried a great\r\nway; indeed, so far, as to regard all virtue as matter of theory only.\r\nThis, it is true, he never affirmed, as I have heard, to any one; and\r\nyet upon the least attention to his conduct, I cannot help thinking it\r\nwas his real opinion, as it will perfectly reconcile some\r\ncontradictions which might otherwise appear in his character.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman and Mr Thwackum scarce ever met without a disputation;\r\nfor their tenets were indeed diametrically opposite to each other.\r\nSquare held human nature to be the perfection of all virtue, and that\r\nvice was a deviation from our nature, in the same manner as deformity\r\nof body is. Thwackum, on the contrary, maintained that the human mind,\r\nsince the fall, was nothing but a sink of iniquity, till purified and\r\nredeemed by grace. In one point only they agreed, which was, in all\r\ntheir discourses on morality never to mention the word goodness. The\r\nfavourite phrase of the former, was the natural beauty of virtue; that\r\nof the latter, was the divine power of grace. The former measured all\r\nactions by the unalterable rule of right, and the eternal fitness of\r\nthings; the latter decided all matters by authority; but in doing\r\nthis, he always used the scriptures and their commentators, as the\r\nlawyer doth his Coke upon Lyttleton, where the comment is of equal\r\nauthority with the text.\r\n\r\nAfter this short introduction, the reader will be pleased to remember,\r\nthat the parson had concluded his speech with a triumphant question,\r\nto which he had apprehended no answer; viz., Can any honour exist\r\nindependent on religion?\r\n\r\nTo this Square answered; that it was impossible to discourse\r\nphilosophically concerning words, till their meaning was first\r\nestablished: that there were scarce any two words of a more vague and\r\nuncertain signification, than the two he had mentioned; for that there\r\nwere almost as many different opinions concerning honour, as\r\nconcerning religion. “But,” says he, “if by honour you mean the true\r\nnatural beauty of virtue, I will maintain it may exist independent of\r\nany religion whatever. Nay,” added he, “you yourself will allow it may\r\nexist independent of all but one: so will a Mahometan, a Jew, and all\r\nthe maintainers of all the different sects in the world.”\r\n\r\nThwackum replied, this was arguing with the usual malice of all the\r\nenemies to the true Church. He said, he doubted not but that all the\r\ninfidels and hereticks in the world would, if they could, confine\r\nhonour to their own absurd errors and damnable deceptions; “but\r\nhonour,” says he, “is not therefore manifold, because there are many\r\nabsurd opinions about it; nor is religion manifold, because there are\r\nvarious sects and heresies in the world. When I mention religion, I\r\nmean the Christian religion; and not only the Christian religion, but\r\nthe Protestant religion; and not only the Protestant religion, but the\r\nChurch of England. And when I mention honour, I mean that mode of\r\nDivine grace which is not only consistent with, but dependent upon,\r\nthis religion; and is consistent with and dependent upon no other. Now\r\nto say that the honour I here mean, and which was, I thought, all the\r\nhonour I could be supposed to mean, will uphold, much less dictate an\r\nuntruth, is to assert an absurdity too shocking to be conceived.”\r\n\r\n“I purposely avoided,” says Square, “drawing a conclusion which I\r\nthought evident from what I have said; but if you perceived it, I am\r\nsure you have not attempted to answer it. However, to drop the article\r\nof religion, I think it is plain, from what you have said, that we\r\nhave different ideas of honour; or why do we not agree in the same\r\nterms of its explanation? I have asserted, that true honour and true\r\nvirtue are almost synonymous terms, and they are both founded on the\r\nunalterable rule of right, and the eternal fitness of things; to which\r\nan untruth being absolutely repugnant and contrary, it is certain that\r\ntrue honour cannot support an untruth. In this, therefore, I think we\r\nare agreed; but that this honour can be said to be founded on\r\nreligion, to which it is antecedent, if by religion be meant any\r\npositive law--”\r\n\r\n“I agree,” answered Thwackum, with great warmth, “with a man who\r\nasserts honour to be antecedent to religion! Mr Allworthy, did I\r\nagree--?”\r\n\r\nHe was proceeding when Mr Allworthy interposed, telling them very\r\ncoldly, they had both mistaken his meaning; for that he had said\r\nnothing of true honour.--It is possible, however, he would not have\r\neasily quieted the disputants, who were growing equally warm, had not\r\nanother matter now fallen out, which put a final end to the\r\nconversation at present."

      "content": "Containing a necessary apology for the author; and a childish\r\nincident, which perhaps requires an apology likewise.\r\n\nBefore I proceed farther, I shall beg leave to obviate some\r\nmisconstructions into which the zeal of some few readers may lead\r\nthem; for I would not willingly give offence to any, especially to men\r\nwho are warm in the cause of virtue or religion.\r\n\r\nI hope, therefore, no man will, by the grossest misunderstanding or\r\nperversion of my meaning, misrepresent me, as endeavouring to cast any\r\nridicule on the greatest perfections of human nature; and which do,\r\nindeed, alone purify and ennoble the heart of man, and raise him above\r\nthe brute creation. This, reader, I will venture to say (and by how\r\nmuch the better man you are yourself, by so much the more will you be\r\ninclined to believe me), that I would rather have buried the\r\nsentiments of these two persons in eternal oblivion, than have done\r\nany injury to either of these glorious causes.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, it is with a view to their service, that I have taken\r\nupon me to record the lives and actions of two of their false and\r\npretended champions. A treacherous friend is the most dangerous enemy;\r\nand I will say boldly, that both religion and virtue have received\r\nmore real discredit from hypocrites than the wittiest profligates or\r\ninfidels could ever cast upon them: nay, farther, as these two, in\r\ntheir purity, are rightly called the bands of civil society, and are\r\nindeed the greatest of blessings; so when poisoned and corrupted with\r\nfraud, pretence, and affectation, they have become the worst of civil\r\ncurses, and have enabled men to perpetrate the most cruel mischiefs to\r\ntheir own species.\r\n\r\nIndeed, I doubt not but this ridicule will in general be allowed: my\r\nchief apprehension is, as many true and just sentiments often came\r\nfrom the mouths of these persons, lest the whole should be taken\r\ntogether, and I should be conceived to ridicule all alike. Now the\r\nreader will be pleased to consider, that, as neither of these men were\r\nfools, they could not be supposed to have holden none but wrong\r\nprinciples, and to have uttered nothing but absurdities; what\r\ninjustice, therefore, must I have done to their characters, had I\r\nselected only what was bad! And how horribly wretched and maimed must\r\ntheir arguments have appeared!\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, it is not religion or virtue, but the want of them,\r\nwhich is here exposed. Had not Thwackum too much neglected virtue, and\r\nSquare, religion, in the composition of their several systems, and had\r\nnot both utterly discarded all natural goodness of heart, they had\r\nnever been represented as the objects of derision in this history; in\r\nwhich we will now proceed.\r\n\r\nThis matter then, which put an end to the debate mentioned in the last\r\nchapter, was no other than a quarrel between Master Blifil and Tom\r\nJones, the consequence of which had been a bloody nose to the former;\r\nfor though Master Blifil, notwithstanding he was the younger, was in\r\nsize above the other's match, yet Tom was much his superior at the\r\nnoble art of boxing.\r\n\r\nTom, however, cautiously avoided all engagements with that youth; for\r\nbesides that Tommy Jones was an inoffensive lad amidst all his\r\nroguery, and really loved Blifil, Mr Thwackum being always the second\r\nof the latter, would have been sufficient to deter him.\r\n\r\nBut well says a certain author, No man is wise at all hours; it is\r\ntherefore no wonder that a boy is not so. A difference arising at play\r\nbetween the two lads, Master Blifil called Tom a beggarly bastard.\r\nUpon which the latter, who was somewhat passionate in his disposition,\r\nimmediately caused that phenomenon in the face of the former, which we\r\nhave above remembered.\r\n\r\nMaster Blifil now, with his blood running from his nose, and the tears\r\ngalloping after from his eyes, appeared before his uncle and the\r\ntremendous Thwackum. In which court an indictment of assault, battery,\r\nand wounding, was instantly preferred against Tom; who in his excuse\r\nonly pleaded the provocation, which was indeed all the matter that\r\nMaster Blifil had omitted.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed possible that this circumstance might have escaped his\r\nmemory; for, in his reply, he positively insisted, that he had made\r\nuse of no such appellation; adding, “Heaven forbid such naughty words\r\nshould ever come out of his mouth!”\r\n\r\nTom, though against all form of law, rejoined in affirmance of the\r\nwords. Upon which Master Blifil said, “It is no wonder. Those who will\r\ntell one fib, will hardly stick at another. If I had told my master\r\nsuch a wicked fib as you have done, I should be ashamed to show my\r\nface.”\r\n\r\n“What fib, child?” cries Thwackum pretty eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Why, he told you that nobody was with him a shooting when he killed\r\nthe partridge; but he knows” (here he burst into a flood of tears),\r\n“yes, he knows, for he confessed it to me, that Black George the\r\ngamekeeper was there. Nay, he said--yes you did--deny it if you can,\r\nthat you would not have confest the truth, though master had cut you\r\nto pieces.”\r\n\r\nAt this the fire flashed from Thwackum's eyes, and he cried out in\r\ntriumph--“Oh! ho! this is your mistaken notion of honour! This is the\r\nboy who was not to be whipped again!” But Mr Allworthy, with a more\r\ngentle aspect, turned towards the lad, and said, “Is this true, child?\r\nHow came you to persist so obstinately in a falsehood?”\r\n\r\nTom said, “He scorned a lie as much as any one: but he thought his\r\nhonour engaged him to act as he did; for he had promised the poor\r\nfellow to conceal him: which,” he said, “he thought himself farther\r\nobliged to, as the gamekeeper had begged him not to go into the\r\ngentleman's manor, and had at last gone himself, in compliance with\r\nhis persuasions.” He said, “This was the whole truth of the matter,\r\nand he would take his oath of it;” and concluded with very\r\npassionately begging Mr Allworthy “to have compassion on the poor\r\nfellow's family, especially as he himself only had been guilty, and\r\nthe other had been very difficultly prevailed on to do what he did.\r\nIndeed, sir,” said he, “it could hardly be called a lie that I told;\r\nfor the poor fellow was entirely innocent of the whole matter. I\r\nshould have gone alone after the birds; nay, I did go at first, and he\r\nonly followed me to prevent more mischief. Do, pray, sir, let me be\r\npunished; take my little horse away again; but pray, sir, forgive poor\r\nGeorge.”\r\n\r\nMr Allworthy hesitated a few moments, and then dismissed the boys,\r\nadvising them to live more friendly and peaceably together."

      "content": "The opinions of the divine and the philosopher concerning the two\r\nboys; with some reasons for their opinions, and other matters.\r\n\nIt is probable, that by disclosing this secret, which had been\r\ncommunicated in the utmost confidence to him, young Blifil preserved\r\nhis companion from a good lashing; for the offence of the bloody nose\r\nwould have been of itself sufficient cause for Thwackum to have\r\nproceeded to correction; but now this was totally absorbed in the\r\nconsideration of the other matter; and with regard to this, Mr\r\nAllworthy declared privately, he thought the boy deserved reward\r\nrather than punishment, so that Thwackum's hand was withheld by a\r\ngeneral pardon.\r\n\r\nThwackum, whose meditations were full of birch, exclaimed against this\r\nweak, and, as he said he would venture to call it, wicked lenity. To\r\nremit the punishment of such crimes was, he said, to encourage them.\r\nHe enlarged much on the correction of children, and quoted many texts\r\nfrom Solomon, and others; which being to be found in so many other\r\nbooks, shall not be found here. He then applied himself to the vice of\r\nlying, on which head he was altogether as learned as he had been on\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nSquare said, he had been endeavouring to reconcile the behaviour of\r\nTom with his idea of perfect virtue, but could not. He owned there was\r\nsomething which at first sight appeared like fortitude in the action;\r\nbut as fortitude was a virtue, and falsehood a vice, they could by no\r\nmeans agree or unite together. He added, that as this was in some\r\nmeasure to confound virtue and vice, it might be worth Mr Thwackum's\r\nconsideration, whether a larger castigation might not be laid on upon\r\nthe account.\r\n\r\nAs both these learned men concurred in censuring Jones, so were they\r\nno less unanimous in applauding Master Blifil. To bring truth to\r\nlight, was by the parson asserted to be the duty of every religious\r\nman; and by the philosopher this was declared to be highly conformable\r\nwith the rule of right, and the eternal and unalterable fitness of\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nAll this, however, weighed very little with Mr Allworthy. He could not\r\nbe prevailed on to sign the warrant for the execution of Jones. There\r\nwas something within his own breast with which the invincible fidelity\r\nwhich that youth had preserved, corresponded much better than it had\r\ndone with the religion of Thwackum, or with the virtue of Square. He\r\ntherefore strictly ordered the former of these gentlemen to abstain\r\nfrom laying violent hands on Tom for what had past. The pedagogue was\r\nobliged to obey those orders; but not without great reluctance, and\r\nfrequent mutterings that the boy would be certainly spoiled.\r\n\r\nTowards the gamekeeper the good man behaved with more severity. He\r\npresently summoned that poor fellow before him, and after many bitter\r\nremonstrances, paid him his wages, and dismist him from his service;\r\nfor Mr Allworthy rightly observed, that there was a great difference\r\nbetween being guilty of a falsehood to excuse yourself, and to excuse\r\nanother. He likewise urged, as the principal motive to his inflexible\r\nseverity against this man, that he had basely suffered Tom Jones to\r\nundergo so heavy a punishment for his sake, whereas he ought to have\r\nprevented it by making the discovery himself.\r\n\r\nWhen this story became public, many people differed from Square and\r\nThwackum, in judging the conduct of the two lads on the occasion.\r\nMaster Blifil was generally called a sneaking rascal, a poor-spirited\r\nwretch, with other epithets of the like kind; whilst Tom was honoured\r\nwith the appellations of a brave lad, a jolly dog, and an honest\r\nfellow. Indeed, his behaviour to Black George much ingratiated him\r\nwith all the servants; for though that fellow was before universally\r\ndisliked, yet he was no sooner turned away than he was as universally\r\npitied; and the friendship and gallantry of Tom Jones was celebrated\r\nby them all with the highest applause; and they condemned Master\r\nBlifil as openly as they durst, without incurring the danger of\r\noffending his mother. For all this, however, poor Tom smarted in the\r\nflesh; for though Thwackum had been inhibited to exercise his arm on\r\nthe foregoing account, yet, as the proverb says, It is easy to find a\r\nstick, &c. So was it easy to find a rod; and, indeed, the not being\r\nable to find one was the only thing which could have kept Thwackum any\r\nlong time from chastising poor Jones.\r\n\r\nHad the bare delight in the sport been the only inducement to the\r\npedagogue, it is probable Master Blifil would likewise have had his\r\nshare; but though Mr Allworthy had given him frequent orders to make\r\nno difference between the lads, yet was Thwackum altogether as kind\r\nand gentle to this youth, as he was harsh, nay even barbarous, to the\r\nother. To say the truth, Blifil had greatly gained his master's\r\naffections; partly by the profound respect he always showed his\r\nperson, but much more by the decent reverence with which he received\r\nhis doctrine; for he had got by heart, and frequently repeated, his\r\nphrases, and maintained all his master's religious principles with a\r\nzeal which was surprizing in one so young, and which greatly endeared\r\nhim to the worthy preceptor.\r\n\r\nTom Jones, on the other hand, was not only deficient in outward tokens\r\nof respect, often forgetting to pull off his hat, or to bow at his\r\nmaster's approach; but was altogether as unmindful both of his\r\nmaster's precepts and example. He was indeed a thoughtless, giddy\r\nyouth, with little sobriety in his manners, and less in his\r\ncountenance; and would often very impudently and indecently laugh at\r\nhis companion for his serious behaviour.\r\n\r\nMr Square had the same reason for his preference of the former lad;\r\nfor Tom Jones showed no more regard to the learned discourses which\r\nthis gentleman would sometimes throw away upon him, than to those of\r\nThwackum. He once ventured to make a jest of the rule of right; and at\r\nanother time said, he believed there was no rule in the world capable\r\nof making such a man as his father (for so Mr Allworthy suffered\r\nhimself to be called).\r\n\r\nMaster Blifil, on the contrary, had address enough at sixteen to\r\nrecommend himself at one and the same time to both these opposites.\r\nWith one he was all religion, with the other he was all virtue. And\r\nwhen both were present, he was profoundly silent, which both\r\ninterpreted in his favour and in their own.\r\n\r\nNor was Blifil contented with flattering both these gentlemen to their\r\nfaces; he took frequent occasions of praising them behind their backs\r\nto Allworthy; before whom, when they two were alone, and his uncle\r\ncommended any religious or virtuous sentiment (for many such came\r\nconstantly from him) he seldom failed to ascribe it to the good\r\ninstructions he had received from either Thwackum or Square; for he\r\nknew his uncle repeated all such compliments to the persons for whose\r\nuse they were meant; and he found by experience the great impressions\r\nwhich they made on the philosopher, as well as on the divine: for, to\r\nsay the truth, there is no kind of flattery so irresistible as this,\r\nat second hand.\r\n\r\nThe young gentleman, moreover, soon perceived how extremely grateful\r\nall those panegyrics on his instructors were to Mr Allworthy himself,\r\nas they so loudly resounded the praise of that singular plan of\r\neducation which he had laid down; for this worthy man having observed\r\nthe imperfect institution of our public schools, and the many vices\r\nwhich boys were there liable to learn, had resolved to educate his\r\nnephew, as well as the other lad, whom he had in a manner adopted, in\r\nhis own house; where he thought their morals would escape all that\r\ndanger of being corrupted to which they would be unavoidably exposed\r\nin any public school or university.\r\n\r\nHaving, therefore, determined to commit these boys to the tuition of a\r\nprivate tutor, Mr Thwackum was recommended to him for that office, by\r\na very particular friend, of whose understanding Mr Allworthy had a\r\ngreat opinion, and in whose integrity he placed much confidence. This\r\nThwackum was fellow of a college, where he almost entirely resided;\r\nand had a great reputation for learning, religion, and sobriety of\r\nmanners. And these were doubtless the qualifications by which Mr\r\nAllworthy's friend had been induced to recommend him; though indeed\r\nthis friend had some obligations to Thwackum's family, who were the\r\nmost considerable persons in a borough which that gentleman\r\nrepresented in parliament.\r\n\r\nThwackum, at his first arrival, was extremely agreeable to Allworthy;\r\nand indeed he perfectly answered the character which had been given of\r\nhim. Upon longer acquaintance, however, and more intimate\r\nconversation, this worthy man saw infirmities in the tutor, which he\r\ncould have wished him to have been without; though as those seemed\r\ngreatly overbalanced by his good qualities, they did not incline Mr\r\nAllworthy to part with him: nor would they indeed have justified such\r\na proceeding; for the reader is greatly mistaken, if he conceives that\r\nThwackum appeared to Mr Allworthy in the same light as he doth to him\r\nin this history; and he is as much deceived, if he imagines that the\r\nmost intimate acquaintance which he himself could have had with that\r\ndivine, would have informed him of those things which we, from our\r\ninspiration, are enabled to open and discover. Of readers who, from\r\nsuch conceits as these, condemn the wisdom or penetration of Mr\r\nAllworthy, I shall not scruple to say, that they make a very bad and\r\nungrateful use of that knowledge which we have communicated to them.\r\n\r\nThese apparent errors in the doctrine of Thwackum served greatly to\r\npalliate the contrary errors in that of Square, which our good man no\r\nless saw and condemned. He thought, indeed, that the different\r\nexuberancies of these gentlemen would correct their different\r\nimperfections; and that from both, especially with his assistance, the\r\ntwo lads would derive sufficient precepts of true religion and virtue.\r\nIf the event happened contrary to his expectations, this possibly\r\nproceeded from some fault in the plan itself; which the reader hath my\r\nleave to discover, if he can: for we do not pretend to introduce any\r\ninfallible characters into this history; where we hope nothing will be\r\nfound which hath never yet been seen in human nature.\r\n\r\nTo return therefore: the reader will not, I think, wonder that the\r\ndifferent behaviour of the two lads above commemorated, produced the\r\ndifferent effects of which he hath already seen some instance; and\r\nbesides this, there was another reason for the conduct of the\r\nphilosopher and the pedagogue; but this being matter of great\r\nimportance, we shall reveal it in the next chapter."

      "content": "Containing a better reason still for the before-mentioned opinions.\r\n\nIt is to be known then, that those two learned personages, who have\r\nlately made a considerable figure on the theatre of this history, had,\r\nfrom their first arrival at Mr Allworthy's house, taken so great an\r\naffection, the one to his virtue, the other to his religion, that they\r\nhad meditated the closest alliance with him.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose they had cast their eyes on that fair widow, whom,\r\nthough we have not for some time made any mention of her, the reader,\r\nwe trust, hath not forgot. Mrs Blifil was indeed the object to which\r\nthey both aspired.\r\n\r\nIt may seem remarkable, that, of four persons whom we have\r\ncommemorated at Mr Allworthy's house, three of them should fix their\r\ninclinations on a lady who was never greatly celebrated for her\r\nbeauty, and who was, moreover, now a little descended into the vale of\r\nyears; but in reality bosom friends, and intimate acquaintance, have a\r\nkind of natural propensity to particular females at the house of a\r\nfriend--viz., to his grandmother, mother, sister, daughter, aunt,\r\nniece, or cousin, when they are rich; and to his wife, sister,\r\ndaughter, niece, cousin, mistress, or servant-maid, if they should be\r\nhandsome.\r\n\r\nWe would not, however, have our reader imagine, that persons of such\r\ncharacters as were supported by Thwackum and Square, would undertake a\r\nmatter of this kind, which hath been a little censured by some rigid\r\nmoralists, before they had thoroughly examined it, and considered\r\nwhether it was (as Shakespear phrases it) “Stuff o' th' conscience,”\r\n or no. Thwackum was encouraged to the undertaking by reflecting that\r\nto covet your neighbour's sister is nowhere forbidden: and he knew it\r\nwas a rule in the construction of all laws, that “_Expressum facit\r\ncessare tacitum._” The sense of which is, “When a lawgiver sets down\r\nplainly his whole meaning, we are prevented from making him mean what\r\nwe please ourselves.” As some instances of women, therefore, are\r\nmentioned in the divine law, which forbids us to covet our neighbour's\r\ngoods, and that of a sister omitted, he concluded it to be lawful. And\r\nas to Square, who was in his person what is called a jolly fellow, or\r\na widow's man, he easily reconciled his choice to the eternal fitness\r\nof things.\r\n\r\nNow, as both of these gentlemen were industrious in taking every\r\nopportunity of recommending themselves to the widow, they apprehended\r\none certain method was, by giving her son the constant preference to\r\nthe other lad; and as they conceived the kindness and affection which\r\nMr Allworthy showed the latter, must be highly disagreeable to her,\r\nthey doubted not but the laying hold on all occasions to degrade and\r\nvilify him, would be highly pleasing to her; who, as she hated the\r\nboy, must love all those who did him any hurt. In this Thwackum had\r\nthe advantage; for while Square could only scarify the poor lad's\r\nreputation, he could flea his skin; and, indeed, he considered every\r\nlash he gave him as a compliment paid to his mistress; so that he\r\ncould, with the utmost propriety, repeat this old flogging line,\r\n_“Castigo te non quod odio habeam, sed quod_ AMEM. I chastise thee not\r\nout of hatred, but out of love.” And this, indeed, he often had in his\r\nmouth, or rather, according to the old phrase, never more properly\r\napplied, at his fingers' ends.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, principally, the two gentlemen concurred, as we have\r\nseen above, in their opinion concerning the two lads; this being,\r\nindeed, almost the only instance of their concurring on any point;\r\nfor, beside the difference of their principles, they had both long ago\r\nstrongly suspected each other's design, and hated one another with no\r\nlittle degree of inveteracy.\r\n\r\nThis mutual animosity was a good deal increased by their alternate\r\nsuccesses; for Mrs Blifil knew what they would be at long before they\r\nimagined it; or, indeed, intended she should: for they proceeded with\r\ngreat caution, lest she should be offended, and acquaint Mr Allworthy.\r\nBut they had no reason for any such fear; she was well enough pleased\r\nwith a passion, of which she intended none should have any fruits but\r\nherself. And the only fruits she designed for herself were, flattery\r\nand courtship; for which purpose she soothed them by turns, and a long\r\ntime equally. She was, indeed, rather inclined to favour the parson's\r\nprinciples; but Square's person was more agreeable to her eye, for he\r\nwas a comely man; whereas the pedagogue did in countenance very nearly\r\nresemble that gentleman, who, in the Harlot's Progress, is seen\r\ncorrecting the ladies in Bridewell.\r\n\r\nWhether Mrs Blifil had been surfeited with the sweets of marriage, or\r\ndisgusted by its bitters, or from what other cause it proceeded, I\r\nwill not determine; but she could never be brought to listen to any\r\nsecond proposals. However, she at last conversed with Square with such\r\na degree of intimacy that malicious tongues began to whisper things of\r\nher, to which, as well for the sake of the lady, as that they were\r\nhighly disagreeable to the rule of right and the fitness of things, we\r\nwill give no credit, and therefore shall not blot our paper with them.\r\nThe pedagogue, 'tis certain, whipped on, without getting a step nearer\r\nto his journey's end.\r\n\r\nIndeed he had committed a great error, and that Square discovered much\r\nsooner than himself. Mrs Blifil (as, perhaps, the reader may have\r\nformerly guessed) was not over and above pleased with the behaviour of\r\nher husband; nay, to be honest, she absolutely hated him, till his\r\ndeath at last a little reconciled him to her affections. It will not\r\nbe therefore greatly wondered at, if she had not the most violent\r\nregard to the offspring she had by him. And, in fact, she had so\r\nlittle of this regard, that in his infancy she seldom saw her son, or\r\ntook any notice of him; and hence she acquiesced, after a little\r\nreluctance, in all the favours which Mr Allworthy showered on the\r\nfoundling; whom the good man called his own boy, and in all things put\r\non an entire equality with Master Blifil. This acquiescence in Mrs\r\nBlifil was considered by the neighbours, and by the family, as a mark\r\nof her condescension to her brother's humour, and she was imagined by\r\nall others, as well as Thwackum and Square, to hate the foundling in\r\nher heart; nay, the more civility she showed him, the more they\r\nconceived she detested him, and the surer schemes she was laying for\r\nhis ruin: for as they thought it her interest to hate him, it was very\r\ndifficult for her to persuade them she did not.\r\n\r\nThwackum was the more confirmed in his opinion, as she had more than\r\nonce slily caused him to whip Tom Jones, when Mr Allworthy, who was an\r\nenemy to this exercise, was abroad; whereas she had never given any\r\nsuch orders concerning young Blifil. And this had likewise imposed\r\nupon Square. In reality, though she certainly hated her own son--of\r\nwhich, however monstrous it appears, I am assured she is not a\r\nsingular instance--she appeared, notwithstanding all her outward\r\ncompliance, to be in her heart sufficiently displeased with all the\r\nfavour shown by Mr Allworthy to the foundling. She frequently\r\ncomplained of this behind her brother's back, and very sharply\r\ncensured him for it, both to Thwackum and Square; nay, she would throw\r\nit in the teeth of Allworthy himself, when a little quarrel, or miff,\r\nas it is vulgarly called, arose between them.\r\n\r\nHowever, when Tom grew up, and gave tokens of that gallantry of temper\r\nwhich greatly recommends men to women, this disinclination which she\r\nhad discovered to him when a child, by degrees abated, and at last she\r\nso evidently demonstrated her affection to him to be much stronger\r\nthan what she bore her own son, that it was impossible to mistake her\r\nany longer. She was so desirous of often seeing him, and discovered\r\nsuch satisfaction and delight in his company, that before he was\r\neighteen years old he was become a rival to both Square and Thwackum;\r\nand what is worse, the whole country began to talk as loudly of her\r\ninclination to Tom, as they had before done of that which she had\r\nshown to Square: on which account the philosopher conceived the most\r\nimplacable hatred for our poor heroe."

      "content": "In which the author himself makes his appearance on the stage.\r\n\nThough Mr Allworthy was not of himself hasty to see things in a\r\ndisadvantageous light, and was a stranger to the public voice, which\r\nseldom reaches to a brother or a husband, though it rings in the ears\r\nof all the neighbourhood; yet was this affection of Mrs Blifil to Tom,\r\nand the preference which she too visibly gave him to her own son, of\r\nthe utmost disadvantage to that youth.\r\n\r\nFor such was the compassion which inhabited Mr Allworthy's mind, that\r\nnothing but the steel of justice could ever subdue it. To be\r\nunfortunate in any respect was sufficient, if there was no demerit to\r\ncounterpoise it, to turn the scale of that good man's pity, and to\r\nengage his friendship and his benefaction.\r\n\r\nWhen therefore he plainly saw Master Blifil was absolutely detested\r\n(for that he was) by his own mother, he began, on that account only,\r\nto look with an eye of compassion upon him; and what the effects of\r\ncompassion are, in good and benevolent minds, I need not here explain\r\nto most of my readers.\r\n\r\nHenceforward he saw every appearance of virtue in the youth through\r\nthe magnifying end, and viewed all his faults with the glass inverted,\r\nso that they became scarce perceptible. And this perhaps the amiable\r\ntemper of pity may make commendable; but the next step the weakness of\r\nhuman nature alone must excuse; for he no sooner perceived that\r\npreference which Mrs Blifil gave to Tom, than that poor youth (however\r\ninnocent) began to sink in his affections as he rose in hers. This, it\r\nis true, would of itself alone never have been able to eradicate Jones\r\nfrom his bosom; but it was greatly injurious to him, and prepared Mr\r\nAllworthy's mind for those impressions which afterwards produced the\r\nmighty events that will be contained hereafter in this history; and to\r\nwhich, it must be confest, the unfortunate lad, by his own wantonness,\r\nwildness, and want of caution, too much contributed.\r\n\r\nIn recording some instances of these, we shall, if rightly understood,\r\nafford a very useful lesson to those well-disposed youths who shall\r\nhereafter be our readers; for they may here find, that goodness of\r\nheart, and openness of temper, though these may give them great\r\ncomfort within, and administer to an honest pride in their own minds,\r\nwill by no means, alas! do their business in the world. Prudence and\r\ncircumspection are necessary even to the best of men. They are indeed,\r\nas it were, a guard to Virtue, without which she can never be safe. It\r\nis not enough that your designs, nay, that your actions, are\r\nintrinsically good; you must take care they shall appear so. If your\r\ninside be never so beautiful, you must preserve a fair outside also.\r\nThis must be constantly looked to, or malice and envy will take care\r\nto blacken it so, that the sagacity and goodness of an Allworthy will\r\nnot be able to see through it, and to discern the beauties within. Let\r\nthis, my young readers, be your constant maxim, that no man can be\r\ngood enough to enable him to neglect the rules of prudence; nor will\r\nVirtue herself look beautiful, unless she be bedecked with the outward\r\nornaments of decency and decorum. And this precept, my worthy\r\ndisciples, if you read with due attention, you will, I hope, find\r\nsufficiently enforced by examples in the following pages.\r\n\r\nI ask pardon for this short appearance, by way of chorus, on the\r\nstage. It is in reality for my own sake, that, while I am discovering\r\nthe rocks on which innocence and goodness often split, I may not be\r\nmisunderstood to recommend the very means to my worthy readers, by\r\nwhich I intend to show them they will be undone. And this, as I could\r\nnot prevail on any of my actors to speak, I myself was obliged to\r\ndeclare."

      "content": "A childish incident, in which, however, is seen a good-natured\r\ndisposition in Tom Jones.\r\n\nThe reader may remember that Mr Allworthy gave Tom Jones a little\r\nhorse, as a kind of smart-money for the punishment which he imagined\r\nhe had suffered innocently.\r\n\r\nThis horse Tom kept above half a year, and then rode him to a\r\nneighbouring fair, and sold him.\r\n\r\nAt his return, being questioned by Thwackum what he had done with the\r\nmoney for which the horse was sold, he frankly declared he would not\r\ntell him.\r\n\r\n“Oho!” says Thwackum, “you will not! then I will have it out of your\r\nbr--h;” that being the place to which he always applied for\r\ninformation on every doubtful occasion.\r\n\r\nTom was now mounted on the back of a footman, and everything prepared\r\nfor execution, when Mr Allworthy, entering the room, gave the criminal\r\na reprieve, and took him with him into another apartment; where, being\r\nalone with Tom, he put the same question to him which Thwackum had\r\nbefore asked him.\r\n\r\nTom answered, he could in duty refuse him nothing; but as for that\r\ntyrannical rascal, he would never make him any other answer than with\r\na cudgel, with which he hoped soon to be able to pay him for all his\r\nbarbarities.\r\n\r\nMr Allworthy very severely reprimanded the lad for his indecent and\r\ndisrespectful expressions concerning his master; but much more for his\r\navowing an intention of revenge. He threatened him with the entire\r\nloss of his favour, if he ever heard such another word from his mouth;\r\nfor, he said, he would never support or befriend a reprobate. By these\r\nand the like declarations, he extorted some compunction from Tom, in\r\nwhich that youth was not over-sincere; for he really meditated some\r\nreturn for all the smarting favours he had received at the hands of\r\nthe pedagogue. He was, however, brought by Mr Allworthy to express a\r\nconcern for his resentment against Thwackum; and then the good man,\r\nafter some wholesome admonition, permitted him to proceed, which he\r\ndid as follows:--\r\n\r\n“Indeed, my dear sir, I love and honour you more than all the world: I\r\nknow the great obligations I have to you, and should detest myself if\r\nI thought my heart was capable of ingratitude. Could the little horse\r\nyou gave me speak, I am sure he could tell you how fond I was of your\r\npresent; for I had more pleasure in feeding him than in riding him.\r\nIndeed, sir, it went to my heart to part with him; nor would I have\r\nsold him upon any other account in the world than what I did. You\r\nyourself, sir, I am convinced, in my case, would have done the same:\r\nfor none ever so sensibly felt the misfortunes of others. What would\r\nyou feel, dear sir, if you thought yourself the occasion of them?\r\nIndeed, sir, there never was any misery like theirs.”\r\n\r\n“Like whose, child?” says Allworthy: “What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, sir!” answered Tom, “your poor gamekeeper, with all his large\r\nfamily, ever since your discarding him, have been perishing with all\r\nthe miseries of cold and hunger: I could not bear to see these poor\r\nwretches naked and starving, and at the same time know myself to have\r\nbeen the occasion of all their sufferings. I could not bear it, sir;\r\nupon my soul, I could not.” [Here the tears ran down his cheeks, and\r\nhe thus proceeded.] “It was to save them from absolute destruction I\r\nparted with your dear present, notwithstanding all the value I had for\r\nit: I sold the horse for them, and they have every farthing of the\r\nmoney.”\r\n\r\nMr Allworthy now stood silent for some moments, and before he spoke\r\nthe tears started from his eyes. He at length dismissed Tom with a\r\ngentle rebuke, advising him for the future to apply to him in cases of\r\ndistress, rather than to use extraordinary means of relieving them\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThis affair was afterwards the subject of much debate between Thwackum\r\nand Square. Thwackum held, that this was flying in Mr Allworthy's\r\nface, who had intended to punish the fellow for his disobedience. He\r\nsaid, in some instances, what the world called charity appeared to him\r\nto be opposing the will of the Almighty, which had marked some\r\nparticular persons for destruction; and that this was in like manner\r\nacting in opposition to Mr Allworthy; concluding, as usual, with a\r\nhearty recommendation of birch.\r\n\r\nSquare argued strongly on the other side, in opposition perhaps to\r\nThwackum, or in compliance with Mr Allworthy, who seemed very much to\r\napprove what Jones had done. As to what he urged on this occasion, as\r\nI am convinced most of my readers will be much abler advocates for\r\npoor Jones, it would be impertinent to relate it. Indeed it was not\r\ndifficult to reconcile to the rule of right an action which it would\r\nhave been impossible to deduce from the rule of wrong."

      "content": "Containing an incident of a more heinous kind, with the comments of\r\nThwackum and Square.\r\n\nIt hath been observed by some man of much greater reputation for\r\nwisdom than myself, that misfortunes seldom come single. An instance\r\nof this may, I believe, be seen in those gentlemen who have the\r\nmisfortune to have any of their rogueries detected; for here discovery\r\nseldom stops till the whole is come out. Thus it happened to poor Tom;\r\nwho was no sooner pardoned for selling the horse, than he was\r\ndiscovered to have some time before sold a fine Bible which Mr\r\nAllworthy gave him, the money arising from which sale he had disposed\r\nof in the same manner. This Bible Master Blifil had purchased, though\r\nhe had already such another of his own, partly out of respect for the\r\nbook, and partly out of friendship to Tom, being unwilling that the\r\nBible should be sold out of the family at half-price. He therefore\r\ndeposited the said half-price himself; for he was a very prudent lad,\r\nand so careful of his money, that he had laid up almost every penny\r\nwhich he had received from Mr Allworthy.\r\n\r\nSome people have been noted to be able to read in no book but their\r\nown. On the contrary, from the time when Master Blifil was first\r\npossessed of this Bible, he never used any other. Nay, he was seen\r\nreading in it much oftener than he had before been in his own. Now, as\r\nhe frequently asked Thwackum to explain difficult passages to him,\r\nthat gentleman unfortunately took notice of Tom's name, which was\r\nwritten in many parts of the book. This brought on an inquiry, which\r\nobliged Master Blifil to discover the whole matter.\r\n\r\nThwackum was resolved a crime of this kind, which he called sacrilege,\r\nshould not go unpunished. He therefore proceeded immediately to\r\ncastigation: and not contented with that he acquainted Mr Allworthy,\r\nat their next meeting, with this monstrous crime, as it appeared to\r\nhim: inveighing against Tom in the most bitter terms, and likening him\r\nto the buyers and sellers who were driven out of the temple.\r\n\r\nSquare saw this matter in a very different light. He said, he could\r\nnot perceive any higher crime in selling one book than in selling\r\nanother. That to sell Bibles was strictly lawful by all laws both\r\nDivine and human, and consequently there was no unfitness in it. He\r\ntold Thwackum, that his great concern on this occasion brought to his\r\nmind the story of a very devout woman, who, out of pure regard to\r\nreligion, stole Tillotson's Sermons from a lady of her acquaintance.\r\n\r\nThis story caused a vast quantity of blood to rush into the parson's\r\nface, which of itself was none of the palest; and he was going to\r\nreply with great warmth and anger, had not Mrs Blifil, who was present\r\nat this debate, interposed. That lady declared herself absolutely of\r\nMr Square's side. She argued, indeed, very learnedly in support of his\r\nopinion; and concluded with saying, if Tom had been guilty of any\r\nfault, she must confess her own son appeared to be equally culpable;\r\nfor that she could see no difference between the buyer and the seller;\r\nboth of whom were alike to be driven out of the temple.\r\n\r\nMrs Blifil having declared her opinion, put an end to the debate.\r\nSquare's triumph would almost have stopt his words, had he needed\r\nthem; and Thwackum, who, for reasons before-mentioned, durst not\r\nventure at disobliging the lady, was almost choaked with indignation.\r\nAs to Mr Allworthy, he said, since the boy had been already punished\r\nhe would not deliver his sentiments on the occasion; and whether he\r\nwas or was not angry with the lad, I must leave to the reader's own\r\nconjecture.\r\n\r\nSoon after this, an action was brought against the gamekeeper by\r\nSquire Western (the gentleman in whose manor the partridge was\r\nkilled), for depredations of the like kind. This was a most\r\nunfortunate circumstance for the fellow, as it not only of itself\r\nthreatened his ruin, but actually prevented Mr Allworthy from\r\nrestoring him to his favour: for as that gentleman was walking out one\r\nevening with Master Blifil and young Jones, the latter slily drew him\r\nto the habitation of Black George; where the family of that poor\r\nwretch, namely, his wife and children, were found in all the misery\r\nwith which cold, hunger, and nakedness, can affect human creatures:\r\nfor as to the money they had received from Jones, former debts had\r\nconsumed almost the whole.\r\n\r\nSuch a scene as this could not fail of affecting the heart of Mr\r\nAllworthy. He immediately gave the mother a couple of guineas, with\r\nwhich he bid her cloath her children. The poor woman burst into tears\r\nat this goodness, and while she was thanking him, could not refrain\r\nfrom expressing her gratitude to Tom; who had, she said, long\r\npreserved both her and hers from starving. “We have not,” says she,\r\n“had a morsel to eat, nor have these poor children had a rag to put\r\non, but what his goodness hath bestowed on us.” For, indeed, besides\r\nthe horse and the Bible, Tom had sacrificed a night-gown, and other\r\nthings, to the use of this distressed family.\r\n\r\nOn their return home, Tom made use of all his eloquence to display the\r\nwretchedness of these people, and the penitence of Black George\r\nhimself; and in this he succeeded so well, that Mr Allworthy said, he\r\nthought the man had suffered enough for what was past; that he would\r\nforgive him, and think of some means of providing for him and his\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nJones was so delighted with this news, that, though it was dark when\r\nthey returned home, he could not help going back a mile, in a shower\r\nof rain, to acquaint the poor woman with the glad tidings; but, like\r\nother hasty divulgers of news, he only brought on himself the trouble\r\nof contradicting it: for the ill fortune of Black George made use of\r\nthe very opportunity of his friend's absence to overturn all again."

      "content": "In which Master Blifil and Jones appear in different lights.\r\n\nMaster Blifil fell very short of his companion in the amiable quality\r\nof mercy; but he as greatly exceeded him in one of a much higher kind,\r\nnamely, in justice: in which he followed both the precepts and example\r\nof Thwackum and Square; for though they would both make frequent use\r\nof the word mercy, yet it was plain that in reality Square held it to\r\nbe inconsistent with the rule of right; and Thwackum was for doing\r\njustice, and leaving mercy to heaven. The two gentlemen did indeed\r\nsomewhat differ in opinion concerning the objects of this sublime\r\nvirtue; by which Thwackum would probably have destroyed one half of\r\nmankind, and Square the other half.\r\n\r\nMaster Blifil then, though he had kept silence in the presence of\r\nJones, yet, when he had better considered the matter, could by no\r\nmeans endure the thought of suffering his uncle to confer favours on\r\nthe undeserving. He therefore resolved immediately to acquaint him\r\nwith the fact which we have above slightly hinted to the readers. The\r\ntruth of which was as follows:\r\n\r\nThe gamekeeper, about a year after he was dismissed from Mr\r\nAllworthy's service, and before Tom's selling the horse, being in want\r\nof bread, either to fill his own mouth or those of his family, as he\r\npassed through a field belonging to Mr Western espied a hare sitting\r\nin her form. This hare he had basely and barbarously knocked on the\r\nhead, against the laws of the land, and no less against the laws of\r\nsportsmen.\r\n\r\nThe higgler to whom the hare was sold, being unfortunately taken many\r\nmonths after with a quantity of game upon him, was obliged to make his\r\npeace with the squire, by becoming evidence against some poacher. And\r\nnow Black George was pitched upon by him, as being a person already\r\nobnoxious to Mr Western, and one of no good fame in the country. He\r\nwas, besides, the best sacrifice the higgler could make, as he had\r\nsupplied him with no game since; and by this means the witness had an\r\nopportunity of screening his better customers: for the squire, being\r\ncharmed with the power of punishing Black George, whom a single\r\ntransgression was sufficient to ruin, made no further enquiry.\r\n\r\nHad this fact been truly laid before Mr Allworthy, it might probably\r\nhave done the gamekeeper very little mischief. But there is no zeal\r\nblinder than that which is inspired with the love of justice against\r\noffenders. Master Blifil had forgot the distance of the time. He\r\nvaried likewise in the manner of the fact: and by the hasty addition\r\nof the single letter S he considerably altered the story; for he said\r\nthat George had wired hares. These alterations might probably have\r\nbeen set right, had not Master Blifil unluckily insisted on a promise\r\nof secrecy from Mr Allworthy before he revealed the matter to him; but\r\nby that means the poor gamekeeper was condemned without having an\r\nopportunity to defend himself: for as the fact of killing the hare,\r\nand of the action brought, were certainly true, Mr Allworthy had no\r\ndoubt concerning the rest.\r\n\r\nShort-lived then was the joy of these poor people; for Mr Allworthy\r\nthe next morning declared he had fresh reason, without assigning it,\r\nfor his anger, and strictly forbad Tom to mention George any more:\r\nthough as for his family, he said he would endeavour to keep them from\r\nstarving; but as to the fellow himself, he would leave him to the\r\nlaws, which nothing could keep him from breaking.\r\n\r\nTom could by no means divine what had incensed Mr Allworthy, for of\r\nMaster Blifil he had not the least suspicion. However, as his\r\nfriendship was to be tired out by no disappointments, he now\r\ndetermined to try another method of preserving the poor gamekeeper\r\nfrom ruin.\r\n\r\nJones was lately grown very intimate with Mr Western. He had so\r\ngreatly recommended himself to that gentleman, by leaping over\r\nfive-barred gates, and by other acts of sportsmanship, that the squire\r\nhad declared Tom would certainly make a great man if he had but\r\nsufficient encouragement. He often wished he had himself a son with\r\nsuch parts; and one day very solemnly asserted at a drinking bout,\r\nthat Tom should hunt a pack of hounds for a thousand pound of his\r\nmoney, with any huntsman in the whole country.\r\n\r\nBy such kind of talents he had so ingratiated himself with the squire,\r\nthat he was a most welcome guest at his table, and a favourite\r\ncompanion in his sport: everything which the squire held most dear, to\r\nwit, his guns, dogs, and horses, were now as much at the command of\r\nJones, as if they had been his own. He resolved therefore to make use\r\nof this favour on behalf of his friend Black George, whom he hoped to\r\nintroduce into Mr Western's family, in the same capacity in which he\r\nhad before served Mr Allworthy.\r\n\r\nThe reader, if he considers that this fellow was already obnoxious to\r\nMr Western, and if he considers farther the weighty business by which\r\nthat gentleman's displeasure had been incurred, will perhaps condemn\r\nthis as a foolish and desperate undertaking; but if he should totally\r\ncondemn young Jones on that account, he will greatly applaud him for\r\nstrengthening himself with all imaginable interest on so arduous an\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, then, Tom applied to Mr Western's daughter, a young\r\nlady of about seventeen years of age, whom her father, next after\r\nthose necessary implements of sport just before mentioned, loved and\r\nesteemed above all the world. Now, as she had some influence on the\r\nsquire, so Tom had some little influence on her. But this being the\r\nintended heroine of this work, a lady with whom we ourselves are\r\ngreatly in love, and with whom many of our readers will probably be in\r\nlove too, before we part, it is by no means proper she should make her\r\nappearance at the end of a book.\r\n\nBOOK IV.\r\n\r\nCONTAINING THE TIME OF A YEAR."

      "content": "Containing five pages of paper.\r\n\nAs truth distinguishes our writings from those idle romances which are\r\nfilled with monsters, the productions, not of nature, but of\r\ndistempered brains; and which have been therefore recommended by an\r\neminent critic to the sole use of the pastry-cook; so, on the other\r\nhand, we would avoid any resemblance to that kind of history which a\r\ncelebrated poet seems to think is no less calculated for the emolument\r\nof the brewer, as the reading it should be always attended with a\r\ntankard of good ale--\r\n\r\n While--history with her comrade ale,\r\n Soothes the sad series of her serious tale\r\n\r\nFor as this is the liquor of modern historians, nay, perhaps their\r\nmuse, if we may believe the opinion of Butler, who attributes\r\ninspiration to ale, it ought likewise to be the potation of their\r\nreaders, since every book ought to be read with the same spirit and in\r\nthe same manner as it is writ. Thus the famous author of Hurlothrumbo\r\ntold a learned bishop, that the reason his lordship could not taste\r\nthe excellence of his piece was, that he did not read it with a fiddle\r\nin his hand; which instrument he himself had always had in his own,\r\nwhen he composed it.\r\n\r\nThat our work, therefore, might be in no danger of being likened to\r\nthe labours of these historians, we have taken every occasion of\r\ninterspersing through the whole sundry similes, descriptions, and\r\nother kind of poetical embellishments. These are, indeed, designed to\r\nsupply the place of the said ale, and to refresh the mind, whenever\r\nthose slumbers, which in a long work are apt to invade the reader as\r\nwell as the writer, shall begin to creep upon him. Without\r\ninterruptions of this kind, the best narrative of plain matter of fact\r\nmust overpower every reader; for nothing but the ever lasting\r\nwatchfulness, which Homer has ascribed only to Jove himself, can be\r\nproof against a newspaper of many volumes.\r\n\r\nWe shall leave to the reader to determine with what judgment we have\r\nchosen the several occasions for inserting those ornamental parts of\r\nour work. Surely it will be allowed that none could be more proper\r\nthan the present, where we are about to introduce a considerable\r\ncharacter on the scene; no less, indeed, than the heroine of this\r\nheroic, historical, prosaic poem. Here, therefore, we have thought\r\nproper to prepare the mind of the reader for her reception, by filling\r\nit with every pleasing image which we can draw from the face of\r\nnature. And for this method we plead many precedents. First, this is\r\nan art well known to, and much practised by, our tragick poets, who\r\nseldom fail to prepare their audience for the reception of their\r\nprincipal characters.\r\n\r\nThus the heroe is always introduced with a flourish of drums and\r\ntrumpets, in order to rouse a martial spirit in the audience, and to\r\naccommodate their ears to bombast and fustian, which Mr Locke's blind\r\nman would not have grossly erred in likening to the sound of a\r\ntrumpet. Again, when lovers are coming forth, soft music often\r\nconducts them on the stage, either to soothe the audience with the\r\nsoftness of the tender passion, or to lull and prepare them for that\r\ngentle slumber in which they will most probably be composed by the\r\nensuing scene.\r\n\r\nAnd not only the poets, but the masters of these poets, the managers\r\nof playhouses, seem to be in this secret; for, besides the aforesaid\r\nkettle-drums, &c., which denote the heroe's approach, he is generally\r\nushered on the stage by a large troop of half a dozen scene-shifters;\r\nand how necessary these are imagined to his appearance, may be\r\nconcluded from the following theatrical story:--\r\n\r\nKing Pyrrhus was at dinner at an ale-house bordering on the theatre,\r\nwhen he was summoned to go on the stage. The heroe, being unwilling to\r\nquit his shoulder of mutton, and as unwilling to draw on himself the\r\nindignation of Mr Wilks (his brother-manager) for making the audience\r\nwait, had bribed these his harbingers to be out of the way. While Mr\r\nWilks, therefore, was thundering out, “Where are the carpenters to\r\nwalk on before King Pyrrhus?” that monarch very quietly eat his\r\nmutton, and the audience, however impatient, were obliged to entertain\r\nthemselves with music in his absence.\r\n\r\nTo be plain, I much question whether the politician, who hath\r\ngenerally a good nose, hath not scented out somewhat of the utility of\r\nthis practice. I am convinced that awful magistrate my lord-mayor\r\ncontracts a good deal of that reverence which attends him through the\r\nyear, by the several pageants which precede his pomp. Nay, I must\r\nconfess, that even I myself, who am not remarkably liable to be\r\ncaptivated with show, have yielded not a little to the impressions of\r\nmuch preceding state. When I have seen a man strutting in a\r\nprocession, after others whose business was only to walk before him, I\r\nhave conceived a higher notion of his dignity than I have felt on\r\nseeing him in a common situation. But there is one instance, which\r\ncomes exactly up to my purpose. This is the custom of sending on a\r\nbasket-woman, who is to precede the pomp at a coronation, and to strew\r\nthe stage with flowers, before the great personages begin their\r\nprocession. The antients would certainly have invoked the goddess\r\nFlora for this purpose, and it would have been no difficulty for their\r\npriests, or politicians to have persuaded the people of the real\r\npresence of the deity, though a plain mortal had personated her and\r\nperformed her office. But we have no such design of imposing on our\r\nreader; and therefore those who object to the heathen theology, may,\r\nif they please, change our goddess into the above-mentioned\r\nbasket-woman. Our intention, in short, is to introduce our heroine\r\nwith the utmost solemnity in our power, with an elevation of stile,\r\nand all other circumstances proper to raise the veneration of our\r\nreader.--Indeed we would, for certain causes, advise those of our male\r\nreaders who have any hearts, to read no farther, were we not well\r\nassured, that how amiable soever the picture of our heroine will\r\nappear, as it is really a copy from nature, many of our fair\r\ncountrywomen will be found worthy to satisfy any passion, and to\r\nanswer any idea of female perfection which our pencil will be able to\r\nraise.\r\n\r\nAnd now, without any further preface, we proceed to our next chapter."

      "content": "A short hint of what we can do in the sublime, and a description of\r\nMiss Sophia Western.\r\n\nHushed be every ruder breath. May the heathen ruler of the winds\r\nconfine in iron chains the boisterous limbs of noisy Boreas, and the\r\nsharp-pointed nose of bitter-biting Eurus. Do thou, sweet Zephyrus,\r\nrising from thy fragrant bed, mount the western sky, and lead on those\r\ndelicious gales, the charms of which call forth the lovely Flora from\r\nher chamber, perfumed with pearly dews, when on the 1st of June, her\r\nbirth-day, the blooming maid, in loose attire, gently trips it over\r\nthe verdant mead, where every flower rises to do her homage, till the\r\nwhole field becomes enamelled, and colours contend with sweets which\r\nshall ravish her most.\r\n\r\nSo charming may she now appear! and you the feathered choristers of\r\nnature, whose sweetest notes not even Handel can excell, tune your\r\nmelodious throats to celebrate her appearance. From love proceeds your\r\nmusic, and to love it returns. Awaken therefore that gentle passion in\r\nevery swain: for lo! adorned with all the charms in which nature can\r\narray her; bedecked with beauty, youth, sprightliness, innocence,\r\nmodesty, and tenderness, breathing sweetness from her rosy lips, and\r\ndarting brightness from her sparkling eyes, the lovely Sophia comes!\r\n\r\nReader, perhaps thou hast seen the statue of the _Venus de Medicis_.\r\nPerhaps, too, thou hast seen the gallery of beauties at Hampton Court.\r\nThou may'st remember each bright Churchill of the galaxy, and all the\r\ntoasts of the Kit-cat. Or, if their reign was before thy times, at\r\nleast thou hast seen their daughters, the no less dazzling beauties of\r\nthe present age; whose names, should we here insert, we apprehend they\r\nwould fill the whole volume.\r\n\r\nNow if thou hast seen all these, be not afraid of the rude answer\r\nwhich Lord Rochester once gave to a man who had seen many things. No.\r\nIf thou hast seen all these without knowing what beauty is, thou hast\r\nno eyes; if without feeling its power, thou hast no heart.\r\n\r\nYet is it possible, my friend, that thou mayest have seen all these\r\nwithout being able to form an exact idea of Sophia; for she did not\r\nexactly resemble any of them. She was most like the picture of Lady\r\nRanelagh: and, I have heard, more still to the famous dutchess of\r\nMazarine; but most of all she resembled one whose image never can\r\ndepart from my breast, and whom, if thou dost remember, thou hast\r\nthen, my friend, an adequate idea of Sophia.\r\n\r\nBut lest this should not have been thy fortune, we will endeavour with\r\nour utmost skill to describe this paragon, though we are sensible that\r\nour highest abilities are very inadequate to the task.\r\n\r\nSophia, then, the only daughter of Mr Western, was a middle-sized\r\nwoman; but rather inclining to tall. Her shape was not only exact, but\r\nextremely delicate: and the nice proportion of her arms promised the\r\ntruest symmetry in her limbs. Her hair, which was black, was so\r\nluxuriant, that it reached her middle, before she cut it to comply\r\nwith the modern fashion; and it was now curled so gracefully in her\r\nneck, that few could believe it to be her own. If envy could find any\r\npart of the face which demanded less commendation than the rest, it\r\nmight possibly think her forehead might have been higher without\r\nprejudice to her. Her eyebrows were full, even, and arched beyond the\r\npower of art to imitate. Her black eyes had a lustre in them, which\r\nall her softness could not extinguish. Her nose was exactly regular,\r\nand her mouth, in which were two rows of ivory, exactly answered Sir\r\nJohn Suckling's description in those lines:--\r\n\r\n Her lips were red, and one was thin,\r\n Compar'd to that was next her chin.\r\n Some bee had stung it newly.\r\n\r\nHer cheeks were of the oval kind; and in her right she had a dimple,\r\nwhich the least smile discovered. Her chin had certainly its share in\r\nforming the beauty of her face; but it was difficult to say it was\r\neither large or small, though perhaps it was rather of the former\r\nkind. Her complexion had rather more of the lily than of the rose; but\r\nwhen exercise or modesty increased her natural colour, no vermilion\r\ncould equal it. Then one might indeed cry out with the celebrated Dr\r\nDonne:\r\n\r\n --Her pure and eloquent blood\r\n Spoke in her cheeks, and so distinctly wrought\r\n That one might almost say her body thought.\r\n\r\nHer neck was long and finely turned: and here, if I was not afraid of\r\noffending her delicacy, I might justly say, the highest beauties of\r\nthe famous _Venus de Medicis_ were outdone. Here was whiteness which\r\nno lilies, ivory, nor alabaster could match. The finest cambric might\r\nindeed be supposed from envy to cover that bosom which was much whiter\r\nthan itself.--It was indeed,\r\n\r\n _Nitor splendens Pario marmore purius_.\r\n\r\n A gloss shining beyond the purest brightness of Parian marble.\r\n\r\nSuch was the outside of Sophia; nor was this beautiful frame disgraced\r\nby an inhabitant unworthy of it. Her mind was every way equal to her\r\nperson; nay, the latter borrowed some charms from the former; for when\r\nshe smiled, the sweetness of her temper diffused that glory over her\r\ncountenance which no regularity of features can give. But as there are\r\nno perfections of the mind which do not discover themselves in that\r\nperfect intimacy to which we intend to introduce our reader with this\r\ncharming young creature, so it is needless to mention them here: nay,\r\nit is a kind of tacit affront to our reader's understanding, and may\r\nalso rob him of that pleasure which he will receive in forming his own\r\njudgment of her character.\r\n\r\nIt may, however, be proper to say, that whatever mental\r\naccomplishments she had derived from nature, they were somewhat\r\nimproved and cultivated by art: for she had been educated under the\r\ncare of an aunt, who was a lady of great discretion, and was\r\nthoroughly acquainted with the world, having lived in her youth about\r\nthe court, whence she had retired some years since into the country.\r\nBy her conversation and instructions, Sophia was perfectly well bred,\r\nthough perhaps she wanted a little of that ease in her behaviour which\r\nis to be acquired only by habit, and living within what is called the\r\npolite circle. But this, to say the truth, is often too dearly\r\npurchased; and though it hath charms so inexpressible, that the\r\nFrench, perhaps, among other qualities, mean to express this, when\r\nthey declare they know not what it is; yet its absence is well\r\ncompensated by innocence; nor can good sense and a natural gentility\r\never stand in need of it."

      "content": "Wherein the history goes back to commemorate a trifling incident that\r\nhappened some years since; but which, trifling as it was, had some\r\nfuture consequences.\r\n\nThe amiable Sophia was now in her eighteenth year, when she is\r\nintroduced into this history. Her father, as hath been said, was\r\nfonder of her than of any other human creature. To her, therefore, Tom\r\nJones applied, in order to engage her interest on the behalf of his\r\nfriend the gamekeeper.\r\n\r\nBut before we proceed to this business, a short recapitulation of some\r\nprevious matters may be necessary.\r\n\r\nThough the different tempers of Mr Allworthy and of Mr Western did not\r\nadmit of a very intimate correspondence, yet they lived upon what is\r\ncalled a decent footing together; by which means the young people of\r\nboth families had been acquainted from their infancy; and as they were\r\nall near of the same age, had been frequent playmates together.\r\n\r\nThe gaiety of Tom's temper suited better with Sophia, than the grave\r\nand sober disposition of Master Blifil. And the preference which she\r\ngave the former of these, would often appear so plainly, that a lad of\r\na more passionate turn than Master Blifil was, might have shown some\r\ndispleasure at it.\r\n\r\nAs he did not, however, outwardly express any such disgust, it would\r\nbe an ill office in us to pay a visit to the inmost recesses of his\r\nmind, as some scandalous people search into the most secret affairs of\r\ntheir friends, and often pry into their closets and cupboards, only to\r\ndiscover their poverty and meanness to the world.\r\n\r\nHowever, as persons who suspect they have given others cause of\r\noffence, are apt to conclude they are offended; so Sophia imputed an\r\naction of Master Blifil to his anger, which the superior sagacity of\r\nThwackum and Square discerned to have arisen from a much better\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nTom Jones, when very young, had presented Sophia with a little bird,\r\nwhich he had taken from the nest, had nursed up, and taught to sing.\r\n\r\nOf this bird, Sophia, then about thirteen years old, was so extremely\r\nfond, that her chief business was to feed and tend it, and her chief\r\npleasure to play with it. By these means little Tommy, for so the bird\r\nwas called, was become so tame, that it would feed out of the hand of\r\nits mistress, would perch upon the finger, and lie contented in her\r\nbosom, where it seemed almost sensible of its own happiness; though\r\nshe always kept a small string about its leg, nor would ever trust it\r\nwith the liberty of flying away.\r\n\r\nOne day, when Mr Allworthy and his whole family dined at Mr Western's,\r\nMaster Blifil, being in the garden with little Sophia, and observing\r\nthe extreme fondness that she showed for her little bird, desired her\r\nto trust it for a moment in his hands. Sophia presently complied with\r\nthe young gentleman's request, and after some previous caution,\r\ndelivered him her bird; of which he was no sooner in possession, than\r\nhe slipt the string from its leg and tossed it into the air.\r\n\r\nThe foolish animal no sooner perceived itself at liberty, than\r\nforgetting all the favours it had received from Sophia, it flew\r\ndirectly from her, and perched on a bough at some distance.\r\n\r\nSophia, seeing her bird gone, screamed out so loud, that Tom Jones,\r\nwho was at a little distance, immediately ran to her assistance.\r\n\r\nHe was no sooner informed of what had happened, than he cursed Blifil\r\nfor a pitiful malicious rascal; and then immediately stripping off his\r\ncoat he applied himself to climbing the tree to which the bird\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\nTom had almost recovered his little namesake, when the branch on which\r\nit was perched, and that hung over a canal, broke, and the poor lad\r\nplumped over head and ears into the water.\r\n\r\nSophia's concern now changed its object. And as she apprehended the\r\nboy's life was in danger, she screamed ten times louder than before;\r\nand indeed Master Blifil himself now seconded her with all the\r\nvociferation in his power.\r\n\r\nThe company, who were sitting in a room next the garden, were\r\ninstantly alarmed, and came all forth; but just as they reached the\r\ncanal, Tom (for the water was luckily pretty shallow in that part)\r\narrived safely on shore.\r\n\r\nThwackum fell violently on poor Tom, who stood dropping and shivering\r\nbefore him, when Mr Allworthy desired him to have patience; and\r\nturning to Master Blifil, said, “Pray, child, what is the reason of\r\nall this disturbance?”\r\n\r\nMaster Blifil answered, “Indeed, uncle, I am very sorry for what I\r\nhave done; I have been unhappily the occasion of it all. I had Miss\r\nSophia's bird in my hand, and thinking the poor creature languished\r\nfor liberty, I own I could not forbear giving it what it desired; for\r\nI always thought there was something very cruel in confining anything.\r\nIt seemed to be against the law of nature, by which everything hath a\r\nright to liberty; nay, it is even unchristian, for it is not doing\r\nwhat we would be done by; but if I had imagined Miss Sophia would have\r\nbeen so much concerned at it, I am sure I never would have done it;\r\nnay, if I had known what would have happened to the bird itself: for\r\nwhen Master Jones, who climbed up that tree after it, fell into the\r\nwater, the bird took a second flight, and presently a nasty hawk\r\ncarried it away.”\r\n\r\nPoor Sophia, who now first heard of her little Tommy's fate (for her\r\nconcern for Jones had prevented her perceiving it when it happened),\r\nshed a shower of tears. These Mr Allworthy endeavoured to assuage,\r\npromising her a much finer bird: but she declared she would never have\r\nanother. Her father chid her for crying so for a foolish bird; but\r\ncould not help telling young Blifil, if he was a son of his, his\r\nbackside should be well flead.\r\n\r\nSophia now returned to her chamber, the two young gentlemen were sent\r\nhome, and the rest of the company returned to their bottle; where a\r\nconversation ensued on the subject of the bird, so curious, that we\r\nthink it deserves a chapter by itself."

      "content": "Containing such very deep and grave matters, that some readers,\r\nperhaps, may not relish it.\r\n\nSquare had no sooner lighted his pipe, than, addressing himself to\r\nAllworthy, he thus began: “Sir, I cannot help congratulating you on\r\nyour nephew; who, at an age when few lads have any ideas but of\r\nsensible objects, is arrived at a capacity of distinguishing right\r\nfrom wrong. To confine anything, seems to me against the law of\r\nnature, by which everything hath a right to liberty. These were his\r\nwords; and the impression they have made on me is never to be\r\neradicated. Can any man have a higher notion of the rule of right, and\r\nthe eternal fitness of things? I cannot help promising myself, from\r\nsuch a dawn, that the meridian of this youth will be equal to that of\r\neither the elder or the younger Brutus.”\r\n\r\nHere Thwackum hastily interrupted, and spilling some of his wine, and\r\nswallowing the rest with great eagerness, answered, “From another\r\nexpression he made use of, I hope he will resemble much better men.\r\nThe law of nature is a jargon of words, which means nothing. I know\r\nnot of any such law, nor of any right which can be derived from it. To\r\ndo as we would be done by, is indeed a Christian motive, as the boy\r\nwell expressed himself; and I am glad to find my instructions have\r\nborne such good fruit.”\r\n\r\n“If vanity was a thing fit,” says Square, “I might indulge some on the\r\nsame occasion; for whence only he can have learnt his notions of right\r\nor wrong, I think is pretty apparent. If there be no law of nature,\r\nthere is no right nor wrong.”\r\n\r\n“How!” says the parson, “do you then banish revelation? Am I talking\r\nwith a deist or an atheist?”\r\n\r\n“Drink about,” says Western. “Pox of your laws of nature! I don't know\r\nwhat you mean, either of you, by right and wrong. To take away my\r\ngirl's bird was wrong, in my opinion; and my neighbour Allworthy may\r\ndo as he pleases; but to encourage boys in such practices, is to breed\r\nthem up to the gallows.”\r\n\r\nAllworthy answered, “That he was sorry for what his nephew had done,\r\nbut could not consent to punish him, as he acted rather from a\r\ngenerous than unworthy motive.” He said, “If the boy had stolen the\r\nbird, none would have been more ready to vote for a severe\r\nchastisement than himself; but it was plain that was not his design:”\r\n and, indeed, it was as apparent to him, that he could have no other\r\nview but what he had himself avowed. (For as to that malicious purpose\r\nwhich Sophia suspected, it never once entered into the head of Mr\r\nAllworthy.) He at length concluded with again blaming the action as\r\ninconsiderate, and which, he said, was pardonable only in a child.\r\n\r\nSquare had delivered his opinion so openly, that if he was now silent,\r\nhe must submit to have his judgment censured. He said, therefore, with\r\nsome warmth, “That Mr Allworthy had too much respect to the dirty\r\nconsideration of property. That in passing our judgments on great and\r\nmighty actions, all private regards should be laid aside; for by\r\nadhering to those narrow rules, the younger Brutus had been condemned\r\nof ingratitude, and the elder of parricide.”\r\n\r\n“And if they had been hanged too for those crimes,” cried Thwackum,\r\n“they would have had no more than their deserts. A couple of\r\nheathenish villains! Heaven be praised we have no Brutuses now-a-days!\r\nI wish, Mr Square, you would desist from filling the minds of my\r\npupils with such antichristian stuff; for the consequence must be,\r\nwhile they are under my care, its being well scourged out of them\r\nagain. There is your disciple Tom almost spoiled already. I overheard\r\nhim the other day disputing with Master Blifil that there was no merit\r\nin faith without works. I know that is one of your tenets, and I\r\nsuppose he had it from you.”\r\n\r\n“Don't accuse me of spoiling him,” says Square. “Who taught him to\r\nlaugh at whatever is virtuous and decent, and fit and right in the\r\nnature of things? He is your own scholar, and I disclaim him. No, no,\r\nMaster Blifil is my boy. Young as he is, that lad's notions of moral\r\nrectitude I defy you ever to eradicate.”\r\n\r\nThwackum put on a contemptuous sneer at this, and replied, “Ay, ay, I\r\nwill venture him with you. He is too well grounded for all your\r\nphilosophical cant to hurt. No, no, I have taken care to instil such\r\nprinciples into him--”\r\n\r\n“And I have instilled principles into him too,” cries Square. “What\r\nbut the sublime idea of virtue could inspire a human mind with the\r\ngenerous thought of giving liberty? And I repeat to you again, if it\r\nwas a fit thing to be proud, I might claim the honour of having\r\ninfused that idea.”--\r\n\r\n“And if pride was not forbidden,” said Thwackum, “I might boast of\r\nhaving taught him that duty which he himself assigned as his motive.”\r\n\r\n“So between you both,” says the squire, “the young gentleman hath been\r\ntaught to rob my daughter of her bird. I find I must take care of my\r\npartridge-mew. I shall have some virtuous religious man or other set\r\nall my partridges at liberty.” Then slapping a gentleman of the law,\r\nwho was present, on the back, he cried out, “What say you to this, Mr\r\nCounsellor? Is not this against law?”\r\n\r\nThe lawyer with great gravity delivered himself as follows:--\r\n\r\n“If the case be put of a partridge, there can be no doubt but an\r\naction would lie; for though this be _ferae naturae_, yet being\r\nreclaimed, property vests: but being the case of a singing bird,\r\nthough reclaimed, as it is a thing of base nature, it must be\r\nconsidered as _nullius in bonis_. In this case, therefore, I conceive\r\nthe plaintiff must be non-suited; and I should disadvise the bringing\r\nany such action.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” says the squire, “if it be _nullus bonus_, let us drink about,\r\nand talk a little of the state of the nation, or some such discourse\r\nthat we all understand; for I am sure I don't understand a word of\r\nthis. It may be learning and sense for aught I know: but you shall\r\nnever persuade me into it. Pox! you have neither of you mentioned a\r\nword of that poor lad who deserves to be commended: to venture\r\nbreaking his neck to oblige my girl was a generous-spirited action: I\r\nhave learning enough to see that. D--n me, here's Tom's health! I\r\nshall love the boy for it the longest day I have to live.”\r\n\r\nThus was the debate interrupted; but it would probably have been soon\r\nresumed, had not Mr Allworthy presently called for his coach, and\r\ncarried off the two combatants.\r\n\r\nSuch was the conclusion of this adventure of the bird, and of the\r\ndialogue occasioned by it; which we could not help recounting to our\r\nreader, though it happened some years before that stage or period of\r\ntime at which our history is now arrived."

      "content": "Containing matter accommodated to every taste.\r\n\n“Parva leves capiunt animos--Small things affect light minds,” was the\r\nsentiment of a great master of the passion of love. And certain it is,\r\nthat from this day Sophia began to have some little kindness for Tom\r\nJones, and no little aversion for his companion.\r\n\r\nMany accidents from time to time improved both these passions in her\r\nbreast; which, without our recounting, the reader may well conclude,\r\nfrom what we have before hinted of the different tempers of these\r\nlads, and how much the one suited with her own inclinations more than\r\nthe other. To say the truth, Sophia, when very young, discerned that\r\nTom, though an idle, thoughtless, rattling rascal, was nobody's enemy\r\nbut his own; and that Master Blifil, though a prudent, discreet, sober\r\nyoung gentleman, was at the same time strongly attached to the\r\ninterest only of one single person; and who that single person was the\r\nreader will be able to divine without any assistance of ours.\r\n\r\nThese two characters are not always received in the world with the\r\ndifferent regard which seems severally due to either; and which one\r\nwould imagine mankind, from self-interest, should show towards them.\r\nBut perhaps there may be a political reason for it: in finding one of\r\na truly benevolent disposition, men may very reasonably suppose they\r\nhave found a treasure, and be desirous of keeping it, like all other\r\ngood things, to themselves. Hence they may imagine, that to trumpet\r\nforth the praises of such a person, would, in the vulgar phrase, be\r\ncrying Roast-meat, and calling in partakers of what they intend to\r\napply solely to their own use. If this reason does not satisfy the\r\nreader, I know no other means of accounting for the little respect\r\nwhich I have commonly seen paid to a character which really does great\r\nhonour to human nature, and is productive of the highest good to\r\nsociety. But it was otherwise with Sophia. She honoured Tom Jones, and\r\nscorned Master Blifil, almost as soon as she knew the meaning of those\r\ntwo words.\r\n\r\nSophia had been absent upwards of three years with her aunt; during\r\nall which time she had seldom seen either of these young gentlemen.\r\nShe dined, however, once, together with her aunt, at Mr Allworthy's.\r\nThis was a few days after the adventure of the partridge, before\r\ncommemorated. Sophia heard the whole story at table, where she said\r\nnothing: nor indeed could her aunt get many words from her as she\r\nreturned home; but her maid, when undressing her, happening to say,\r\n“Well, miss, I suppose you have seen young Master Blifil to-day?” she\r\nanswered with much passion, “I hate the name of Master Blifil, as I do\r\nwhatever is base and treacherous: and I wonder Mr Allworthy would\r\nsuffer that old barbarous schoolmaster to punish a poor boy so cruelly\r\nfor what was only the effect of his good-nature.” She then recounted\r\nthe story to her maid, and concluded with saying, “Don't you think he\r\nis a boy of noble spirit?”\r\n\r\nThis young lady was now returned to her father; who gave her the\r\ncommand of his house, and placed her at the upper end of his table,\r\nwhere Tom (who for his great love of hunting was become a great\r\nfavourite of the squire) often dined. Young men of open, generous\r\ndispositions are naturally inclined to gallantry, which, if they have\r\ngood understandings, as was in reality Tom's case, exerts itself in an\r\nobliging complacent behaviour to all women in general. This greatly\r\ndistinguished Tom from the boisterous brutality of mere country\r\nsquires on the one hand, and from the solemn and somewhat sullen\r\ndeportment of Master Blifil on the other; and he began now, at twenty,\r\nto have the name of a pretty fellow among all the women in the\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nTom behaved to Sophia with no particularity, unless perhaps by showing\r\nher a higher respect than he paid to any other. This distinction her\r\nbeauty, fortune, sense, and amiable carriage, seemed to demand; but as\r\nto design upon her person he had none; for which we shall at present\r\nsuffer the reader to condemn him of stupidity; but perhaps we shall be\r\nable indifferently well to account for it hereafter.\r\n\r\nSophia, with the highest degree of innocence and modesty, had a\r\nremarkable sprightliness in her temper. This was so greatly increased\r\nwhenever she was in company with Tom, that had he not been very young\r\nand thoughtless, he must have observed it: or had not Mr Western's\r\nthoughts been generally either in the field, the stable, or the\r\ndog-kennel, it might have perhaps created some jealousy in him: but so\r\nfar was the good gentleman from entertaining any such suspicions, that\r\nhe gave Tom every opportunity with his daughter which any lover could\r\nhave wished; and this Tom innocently improved to better advantage, by\r\nfollowing only the dictates of his natural gallantry and good-nature,\r\nthan he might perhaps have done had he had the deepest designs on the\r\nyoung lady.\r\n\r\nBut indeed it can occasion little wonder that this matter escaped the\r\nobservation of others, since poor Sophia herself never remarked it;\r\nand her heart was irretrievably lost before she suspected it was in\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nMatters were in this situation, when Tom, one afternoon, finding\r\nSophia alone, began, after a short apology, with a very serious face,\r\nto acquaint her that he had a favour to ask of her which he hoped her\r\ngoodness would comply with.\r\n\r\nThough neither the young man's behaviour, nor indeed his manner of\r\nopening this business, were such as could give her any just cause of\r\nsuspecting he intended to make love to her; yet whether Nature\r\nwhispered something into her ear, or from what cause it arose I will\r\nnot determine; certain it is, some idea of that kind must have\r\nintruded itself; for her colour forsook her cheeks, her limbs\r\ntrembled, and her tongue would have faltered, had Tom stopped for an\r\nanswer; but he soon relieved her from her perplexity, by proceeding to\r\ninform her of his request; which was to solicit her interest on behalf\r\nof the gamekeeper, whose own ruin, and that of a large family, must\r\nbe, he said, the consequence of Mr Western's pursuing his action\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\nSophia presently recovered her confusion, and, with a smile full of\r\nsweetness, said, “Is this the mighty favour you asked with so much\r\ngravity? I will do it with all my heart. I really pity the poor\r\nfellow, and no longer ago than yesterday sent a small matter to his\r\nwife.” This small matter was one of her gowns, some linen, and ten\r\nshillings in money, of which Tom had heard, and it had, in reality,\r\nput this solicitation into his head.\r\n\r\nOur youth, now, emboldened with his success, resolved to push the\r\nmatter farther, and ventured even to beg her recommendation of him to\r\nher father's service; protesting that he thought him one of the\r\nhonestest fellows in the country, and extremely well qualified for the\r\nplace of a gamekeeper, which luckily then happened to be vacant.\r\n\r\nSophia answered, “Well, I will undertake this too; but I cannot\r\npromise you as much success as in the former part, which I assure you\r\nI will not quit my father without obtaining. However, I will do what I\r\ncan for the poor fellow; for I sincerely look upon him and his family\r\nas objects of great compassion. And now, Mr Jones, I must ask you a\r\nfavour.”\r\n\r\n“A favour, madam!” cries Tom: “if you knew the pleasure you have given\r\nme in the hopes of receiving a command from you, you would think by\r\nmentioning it you did confer the greatest favour on me; for by this\r\ndear hand I would sacrifice my life to oblige you.”\r\n\r\nHe then snatched her hand, and eagerly kissed it, which was the first\r\ntime his lips had ever touched her. The blood, which before had\r\nforsaken her cheeks, now made her sufficient amends, by rushing all\r\nover her face and neck with such violence, that they became all of a\r\nscarlet colour. She now first felt a sensation to which she had been\r\nbefore a stranger, and which, when she had leisure to reflect on it,\r\nbegan to acquaint her with some secrets, which the reader, if he doth\r\nnot already guess them, will know in due time.\r\n\r\nSophia, as soon as she could speak (which was not instantly), informed\r\nhim that the favour she had to desire of him was, not to lead her\r\nfather through so many dangers in hunting; for that, from what she had\r\nheard, she was terribly frightened every time they went out together,\r\nand expected some day or other to see her father brought home with\r\nbroken limbs. She therefore begged him, for her sake, to be more\r\ncautious; and as he well knew Mr Western would follow him, not to ride\r\nso madly, nor to take those dangerous leaps for the future.\r\n\r\nTom promised faithfully to obey her commands; and after thanking her\r\nfor her kind compliance with his request, took his leave, and departed\r\nhighly charmed with his success.\r\n\r\nPoor Sophia was charmed too, but in a very different way. Her\r\nsensations, however, the reader's heart (if he or she have any) will\r\nbetter represent than I can, if I had as many mouths as ever poet\r\nwished for, to eat, I suppose, those many dainties with which he was\r\nso plentifully provided.\r\n\r\nIt was Mr Western's custom every afternoon, as soon as he was drunk,\r\nto hear his daughter play on the harpsichord; for he was a great lover\r\nof music, and perhaps, had he lived in town, might have passed for a\r\nconnoisseur; for he always excepted against the finest compositions of\r\nMr Handel. He never relished any music but what was light and airy;\r\nand indeed his most favourite tunes were Old Sir Simon the King, St\r\nGeorge he was for England, Bobbing Joan, and some others.\r\n\r\nHis daughter, though she was a perfect mistress of music, and would\r\nnever willingly have played any but Handel's, was so devoted to her\r\nfather's pleasure, that she learnt all those tunes to oblige him.\r\nHowever, she would now and then endeavour to lead him into her own\r\ntaste; and when he required the repetition of his ballads, would\r\nanswer with a “Nay, dear sir;” and would often beg him to suffer her\r\nto play something else.\r\n\r\nThis evening, however, when the gentleman was retired from his bottle,\r\nshe played all his favourites three times over without any\r\nsolicitation. This so pleased the good squire, that he started from\r\nhis couch, gave his daughter a kiss, and swore her hand was greatly\r\nimproved. She took this opportunity to execute her promise to Tom; in\r\nwhich she succeeded so well, that the squire declared, if she would\r\ngive him t'other bout of Old Sir Simon, he would give the gamekeeper\r\nhis deputation the next morning. Sir Simon was played again and again,\r\ntill the charms of the music soothed Mr Western to sleep. In the\r\nmorning Sophia did not fail to remind him of his engagement; and his\r\nattorney was immediately sent for, ordered to stop any further\r\nproceedings in the action, and to make out the deputation.\r\n\r\nTom's success in this affair soon began to ring over the country, and\r\nvarious were the censures passed upon it; some greatly applauding it\r\nas an act of good nature; others sneering, and saying, “No wonder that\r\none idle fellow should love another.” Young Blifil was greatly enraged\r\nat it. He had long hated Black George in the same proportion as Jones\r\ndelighted in him; not from any offence which he had ever received, but\r\nfrom his great love to religion and virtue;--for Black George had the\r\nreputation of a loose kind of a fellow. Blifil therefore represented\r\nthis as flying in Mr Allworthy's face; and declared, with great\r\nconcern, that it was impossible to find any other motive for doing\r\ngood to such a wretch.\r\n\r\nThwackum and Square likewise sung to the same tune. They were now\r\n(especially the latter) become greatly jealous of young Jones with the\r\nwidow; for he now approached the age of twenty, was really a fine\r\nyoung fellow, and that lady, by her encouragements to him, seemed\r\ndaily more and more to think him so.\r\n\r\nAllworthy was not, however, moved with their malice. He declared\r\nhimself very well satisfied with what Jones had done. He said the\r\nperseverance and integrity of his friendship was highly commendable,\r\nand he wished he could see more frequent instances of that virtue.\r\n\r\nBut Fortune, who seldom greatly relishes such sparks as my friend Tom,\r\nperhaps because they do not pay more ardent addresses to her, gave now\r\na very different turn to all his actions, and showed them to Mr\r\nAllworthy in a light far less agreeable than that gentleman's goodness\r\nhad hitherto seen them in."

The former of these will blame his prudence in neglecting an\r\nopportunity to possess himself of Mr Western's fortune; and the latter\r\nwill no less despise him for his backwardness to so fine a girl, who\r\nseemed ready to fly into his arms, if he would open them to receive\r\nher.\r\n\r\nNow, though I shall not perhaps be able absolutely to acquit him of\r\neither of these charges (for want of prudence admits of no excuse; and\r\nwhat I shall produce against the latter charge will, I apprehend, be\r\nscarce satisfactory); yet, as evidence may sometimes be offered in\r\nmitigation, I shall set forth the plain matter of fact, and leave the\r\nwhole to the reader's determination.\r\n\r\nMr Jones had somewhat about him, which, though I think writers are not\r\nthoroughly agreed in its name, doth certainly inhabit some human\r\nbreasts; whose use is not so properly to distinguish right from wrong,\r\nas to prompt and incite them to the former, and to restrain and\r\nwithhold them from the latter.\r\n\r\nThis somewhat may be indeed resembled to the famous trunk-maker in the\r\nplayhouse; for, whenever the person who is possessed of it doth what\r\nis right, no ravished or friendly spectator is so eager or so loud in\r\nhis applause: on the contrary, when he doth wrong, no critic is so apt\r\nto hiss and explode him.\r\n\r\nTo give a higher idea of the principle I mean, as well as one more\r\nfamiliar to the present age; it may be considered as sitting on its\r\nthrone in the mind, like the Lord High Chancellor of this kingdom in\r\nhis court; where it presides, governs, directs, judges, acquits, and\r\ncondemns according to merit and justice, with a knowledge which\r\nnothing escapes, a penetration which nothing can deceive, and an\r\nintegrity which nothing can corrupt.\r\n\r\nThis active principle may perhaps be said to constitute the most\r\nessential barrier between us and our neighbours the brutes; for if\r\nthere be some in the human shape who are not under any such dominion,\r\nI choose rather to consider them as deserters from us to our\r\nneighbours; among whom they will have the fate of deserters, and not\r\nbe placed in the first rank.\r\n\r\nOur heroe, whether he derived it from Thwackum or Square I will not\r\ndetermine, was very strongly under the guidance of this principle; for\r\nthough he did not always act rightly, yet he never did otherwise\r\nwithout feeling and suffering for it. It was this which taught him,\r\nthat to repay the civilities and little friendships of hospitality by\r\nrobbing the house where you have received them, is to be the basest\r\nand meanest of thieves. He did not think the baseness of this offence\r\nlessened by the height of the injury committed; on the contrary, if to\r\nsteal another's plate deserved death and infamy, it seemed to him\r\ndifficult to assign a punishment adequate to the robbing a man of his\r\nwhole fortune, and of his child into the bargain.\r\n\r\nThis principle, therefore, prevented him from any thought of making\r\nhis fortune by such means (for this, as I have said, is an active\r\nprinciple, and doth not content itself with knowledge or belief only).\r\nHad he been greatly enamoured of Sophia, he possibly might have\r\nthought otherwise; but give me leave to say, there is great difference\r\nbetween running away with a man's daughter from the motive of love,\r\nand doing the same thing from the motive of theft.\r\n\r\nNow, though this young gentleman was not insensible of the charms of\r\nSophia; though he greatly liked her beauty, and esteemed all her other\r\nqualifications, she had made, however, no deep impression on his\r\nheart; for which, as it renders him liable to the charge of stupidity,\r\nor at least of want of taste, we shall now proceed to account.\r\n\r\nThe truth then is, his heart was in the possession of another woman.\r\nHere I question not but the reader will be surprized at our long\r\ntaciturnity as to this matter; and quite at a loss to divine who this\r\nwoman was, since we have hitherto not dropt a hint of any one likely\r\nto be a rival to Sophia; for as to Mrs Blifil, though we have been\r\nobliged to mention some suspicions of her affection for Tom, we have\r\nnot hitherto given the least latitude for imagining that he had any\r\nfor her; and, indeed, I am sorry to say it, but the youth of both\r\nsexes are too apt to be deficient in their gratitude for that regard\r\nwith which persons more advanced in years are sometimes so kind to\r\nhonour them.\r\n\r\nThat the reader may be no longer in suspense, he will be pleased to\r\nremember, that we have often mentioned the family of George Seagrim\r\n(commonly called Black George, the gamekeeper), which consisted at\r\npresent of a wife and five children.\r\n\r\nThe second of these children was a daughter, whose name was Molly, and\r\nwho was esteemed one of the handsomest girls in the whole country.\r\n\r\nCongreve well says there is in true beauty something which vulgar\r\nsouls cannot admire; so can no dirt or rags hide this something from\r\nthose souls which are not of the vulgar stamp.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of this girl made, however, no impression on Tom, till she\r\ngrew towards the age of sixteen, when Tom, who was near three years\r\nolder, began first to cast the eyes of affection upon her. And this\r\naffection he had fixed on the girl long before he could bring himself\r\nto attempt the possession of her person: for though his constitution\r\nurged him greatly to this, his principles no less forcibly restrained\r\nhim. To debauch a young woman, however low her condition was, appeared\r\nto him a very heinous crime; and the good-will he bore the father,\r\nwith the compassion he had for his family, very strongly corroborated\r\nall such sober reflections; so that he once resolved to get the better\r\nof his inclinations, and he actually abstained three whole months\r\nwithout ever going to Seagrim's house, or seeing his daughter.\r\n\r\nNow, though Molly was, as we have said, generally thought a very fine\r\ngirl, and in reality she was so, yet her beauty was not of the most\r\namiable kind. It had, indeed, very little of feminine in it, and would\r\nhave become a man at least as well as a woman; for, to say the truth,\r\nyouth and florid health had a very considerable share in the\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nNor was her mind more effeminate than her person. As this was tall and\r\nrobust, so was that bold and forward. So little had she of modesty,\r\nthat Jones had more regard for her virtue than she herself. And as\r\nmost probably she liked Tom as well as he liked her, so when she\r\nperceived his backwardness she herself grew proportionably forward;\r\nand when she saw he had entirely deserted the house, she found means\r\nof throwing herself in his way, and behaved in such a manner that the\r\nyouth must have had very much or very little of the heroe if her\r\nendeavours had proved unsuccessful. In a word, she soon triumphed over\r\nall the virtuous resolutions of Jones; for though she behaved at last\r\nwith all decent reluctance, yet I rather chuse to attribute the\r\ntriumph to her, since, in fact, it was her design which succeeded.\r\n\r\nIn the conduct of this matter, I say, Molly so well played her part,\r\nthat Jones attributed the conquest entirely to himself, and considered\r\nthe young woman as one who had yielded to the violent attacks of his\r\npassion. He likewise imputed her yielding to the ungovernable force of\r\nher love towards him; and this the reader will allow to have been a\r\nvery natural and probable supposition, as we have more than once\r\nmentioned the uncommon comeliness of his person: and, indeed, he was\r\none of the handsomest young fellows in the world.\r\n\r\nAs there are some minds whose affections, like Master Blifil's, are\r\nsolely placed on one single person, whose interest and indulgence\r\nalone they consider on every occasion; regarding the good and ill of\r\nall others as merely indifferent, any farther than as they contribute\r\nto the pleasure or advantage of that person: so there is a different\r\ntemper of mind which borrows a degree of virtue even from self-love.\r\nSuch can never receive any kind of satisfaction from another, without\r\nloving the creature to whom that satisfaction is owing, and without\r\nmaking its well-being in some sort necessary to their own ease.\r\n\r\nOf this latter species was our heroe. He considered this poor girl as\r\none whose happiness or misery he had caused to be dependent on\r\nhimself. Her beauty was still the object of desire, though greater\r\nbeauty, or a fresher object, might have been more so; but the little\r\nabatement which fruition had occasioned to this was highly\r\noverbalanced by the considerations of the affection which she visibly\r\nbore him, and of the situation into which he had brought her. The\r\nformer of these created gratitude, the latter compassion; and both,\r\ntogether with his desire for her person, raised in him a passion which\r\nmight, without any great violence to the word, be called love; though,\r\nperhaps, it was at first not very judiciously placed.\r\n\r\nThis, then, was the true reason of that insensibility which he had\r\nshown to the charms of Sophia, and that behaviour in her which might\r\nhave been reasonably enough interpreted as an encouragement to his\r\naddresses; for as he could not think of abandoning his Molly, poor and\r\ndestitute as she was, so no more could he entertain a notion of\r\nbetraying such a creature as Sophia. And surely, had he given the\r\nleast encouragement to any passion for that young lady, he must have\r\nbeen absolutely guilty of one or other of those crimes; either of\r\nwhich would, in my opinion, have very justly subjected him to that\r\nfate, which, at his first introduction into this history, I mentioned\r\nto have been generally predicted as his certain destiny."

      "content": "Being the shortest chapter in this book.\r\n\nHer mother first perceived the alteration in the shape of Molly; and\r\nin order to hide it from her neighbours, she foolishly clothed her in\r\nthat sack which Sophia had sent her; though, indeed, that young lady\r\nhad little apprehension that the poor woman would have been weak\r\nenough to let any of her daughters wear it in that form.\r\n\r\nMolly was charmed with the first opportunity she ever had of showing\r\nher beauty to advantage; for though she could very well bear to\r\ncontemplate herself in the glass, even when dressed in rags; and\r\nthough she had in that dress conquered the heart of Jones, and perhaps\r\nof some others; yet she thought the addition of finery would much\r\nimprove her charms, and extend her conquests.\r\n\r\nMolly, therefore, having dressed herself out in this sack, with a new\r\nlaced cap, and some other ornaments which Tom had given her, repairs\r\nto church with her fan in her hand the very next Sunday. The great are\r\ndeceived if they imagine they have appropriated ambition and vanity to\r\nthemselves. These noble qualities flourish as notably in a country\r\nchurch and churchyard as in the drawing-room, or in the closet.\r\nSchemes have indeed been laid in the vestry which would hardly\r\ndisgrace the conclave. Here is a ministry, and here is an opposition.\r\nHere are plots and circumventions, parties and factions, equal to\r\nthose which are to be found in courts.\r\n\r\nNor are the women here less practised in the highest feminine arts\r\nthan their fair superiors in quality and fortune. Here are prudes and\r\ncoquettes. Here are dressing and ogling, falsehood, envy, malice,\r\nscandal; in short, everything which is common to the most splendid\r\nassembly, or politest circle. Let those of high life, therefore, no\r\nlonger despise the ignorance of their inferiors; nor the vulgar any\r\nlonger rail at the vices of their betters.\r\n\r\nMolly had seated herself some time before she was known by her\r\nneighbours. And then a whisper ran through the whole congregation,\r\n“Who is she?” but when she was discovered, such sneering, gigling,\r\ntittering, and laughing ensued among the women, that Mr Allworthy was\r\nobliged to exert his authority to preserve any decency among them."

      "content": "A battle sung by the muse in the Homerican style, and which none but\r\nthe classical reader can taste.\r\n\nMr Western had an estate in this parish; and as his house stood at\r\nlittle greater distance from this church than from his own, he very\r\noften came to Divine Service here; and both he and the charming Sophia\r\nhappened to be present at this time.\r\n\r\nSophia was much pleased with the beauty of the girl, whom she pitied\r\nfor her simplicity in having dressed herself in that manner, as she\r\nsaw the envy which it had occasioned among her equals. She no sooner\r\ncame home than she sent for the gamekeeper, and ordered him to bring\r\nhis daughter to her; saying she would provide for her in the family,\r\nand might possibly place the girl about her own person, when her own\r\nmaid, who was now going away, had left her.\r\n\r\nPoor Seagrim was thunderstruck at this; for he was no stranger to the\r\nfault in the shape of his daughter. He answered, in a stammering\r\nvoice, “That he was afraid Molly would be too awkward to wait on her\r\nladyship, as she had never been at service.” “No matter for that,”\r\n says Sophia; “she will soon improve. I am pleased with the girl, and\r\nam resolved to try her.”\r\n\r\nBlack George now repaired to his wife, on whose prudent counsel he\r\ndepended to extricate him out of this dilemma; but when he came\r\nthither he found his house in some confusion. So great envy had this\r\nsack occasioned, that when Mr Allworthy and the other gentry were gone\r\nfrom church, the rage, which had hitherto been confined, burst into an\r\nuproar; and, having vented itself at first in opprobrious words,\r\nlaughs, hisses, and gestures, betook itself at last to certain missile\r\nweapons; which, though from their plastic nature they threatened\r\nneither the loss of life or of limb, were however sufficiently\r\ndreadful to a well-dressed lady. Molly had too much spirit to bear\r\nthis treatment tamely. Having therefore--but hold, as we are diffident\r\nof our own abilities, let us here invite a superior power to our\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nYe Muses, then, whoever ye are, who love to sing battles, and\r\nprincipally thou who whilom didst recount the slaughter in those\r\nfields where Hudibras and Trulla fought, if thou wert not starved with\r\nthy friend Butler, assist me on this great occasion. All things are\r\nnot in the power of all.\r\n\r\nAs a vast herd of cows in a rich farmer's yard, if, while they are\r\nmilked, they hear their calves at a distance, lamenting the robbery\r\nwhich is then committing, roar and bellow; so roared forth the\r\nSomersetshire mob an hallaloo, made up of almost as many squalls,\r\nscreams, and other different sounds as there were persons, or indeed\r\npassions among them: some were inspired by rage, others alarmed by\r\nfear, and others had nothing in their heads but the love of fun; but\r\nchiefly Envy, the sister of Satan, and his constant companion, rushed\r\namong the crowd, and blew up the fury of the women; who no sooner came\r\nup to Molly than they pelted her with dirt and rubbish.\r\n\r\nMolly, having endeavoured in vain to make a handsome retreat, faced\r\nabout; and laying hold of ragged Bess, who advanced in the front of\r\nthe enemy, she at one blow felled her to the ground. The whole army of\r\nthe enemy (though near a hundred in number), seeing the fate of their\r\ngeneral, gave back many paces, and retired behind a new-dug grave; for\r\nthe churchyard was the field of battle, where there was to be a\r\nfuneral that very evening. Molly pursued her victory, and catching up\r\na skull which lay on the side of the grave, discharged it with such\r\nfury, that having hit a taylor on the head, the two skulls sent\r\nequally forth a hollow sound at their meeting, and the taylor took\r\npresently measure of his length on the ground, where the skulls lay\r\nside by side, and it was doubtful which was the more valuable of the\r\ntwo. Molly then taking a thigh-bone in her hand, fell in among the\r\nflying ranks, and dealing her blows with great liberality on either\r\nside, overthrew the carcass of many a mighty heroe and heroine.\r\n\r\nRecount, O Muse, the names of those who fell on this fatal day. First,\r\nJemmy Tweedle felt on his hinder head the direful bone. Him the\r\npleasant banks of sweetly-winding Stour had nourished, where he first\r\nlearnt the vocal art, with which, wandering up and down at wakes and\r\nfairs, he cheered the rural nymphs and swains, when upon the green\r\nthey interweaved the sprightly dance; while he himself stood fiddling\r\nand jumping to his own music. How little now avails his fiddle! He\r\nthumps the verdant floor with his carcass. Next, old Echepole, the\r\nsowgelder, received a blow in his forehead from our Amazonian heroine,\r\nand immediately fell to the ground. He was a swinging fat fellow, and\r\nfell with almost as much noise as a house. His tobacco-box dropped at\r\nthe same time from his pocket, which Molly took up as lawful spoils.\r\nThen Kate of the Mill tumbled unfortunately over a tombstone, which\r\ncatching hold of her ungartered stocking inverted the order of nature,\r\nand gave her heels the superiority to her head. Betty Pippin, with\r\nyoung Roger her lover, fell both to the ground; where, oh perverse\r\nfate! she salutes the earth, and he the sky. Tom Freckle, the smith's\r\nson, was the next victim to her rage. He was an ingenious workman, and\r\nmade excellent pattens; nay, the very patten with which he was knocked\r\ndown was his own workmanship. Had he been at that time singing psalms\r\nin the church, he would have avoided a broken head. Miss Crow, the\r\ndaughter of a farmer; John Giddish, himself a farmer; Nan Slouch,\r\nEsther Codling, Will Spray, Tom Bennet; the three Misses Potter, whose\r\nfather keeps the sign of the Red Lion; Betty Chambermaid, Jack Ostler,\r\nand many others of inferior note, lay rolling among the graves.\r\n\r\nNot that the strenuous arm of Molly reached all these; for many of\r\nthem in their flight overthrew each other.\r\n\r\nBut now Fortune, fearing she had acted out of character, and had\r\ninclined too long to the same side, especially as it was the right\r\nside, hastily turned about: for now Goody Brown--whom Zekiel Brown\r\ncaressed in his arms; nor he alone, but half the parish besides; so\r\nfamous was she in the fields of Venus, nor indeed less in those of\r\nMars. The trophies of both these her husband always bore about on his\r\nhead and face; for if ever human head did by its horns display the\r\namorous glories of a wife, Zekiel's did; nor did his well-scratched\r\nface less denote her talents (or rather talons) of a different kind.\r\n\r\nNo longer bore this Amazon the shameful flight of her party. She stopt\r\nshort, and, calling aloud to all who fled, spoke as follows: “Ye\r\nSomersetshire men, or rather ye Somersetshire women, are ye not\r\nashamed thus to fly from a single woman? But if no other will oppose\r\nher, I myself and Joan Top here will have the honour of the victory.”\r\n Having thus said, she flew at Molly Seagrim, and easily wrenched the\r\nthigh-bone from her hand, at the same time clawing off her cap from\r\nher head. Then laying hold of the hair of Molly with her left hand,\r\nshe attacked her so furiously in the face with the right, that the\r\nblood soon began to trickle from her nose. Molly was not idle this\r\nwhile. She soon removed the clout from the head of Goody Brown, and\r\nthen fastening on her hair with one hand, with the other she caused\r\nanother bloody stream to issue forth from the nostrils of the enemy.\r\n\r\nWhen each of the combatants had borne off sufficient spoils of hair\r\nfrom the head of her antagonist, the next rage was against the\r\ngarments. In this attack they exerted so much violence, that in a very\r\nfew minutes they were both naked to the middle.\r\n\r\nIt is lucky for the women that the seat of fistycuff war is not the\r\nsame with them as among men; but though they may seem a little to\r\ndeviate from their sex, when they go forth to battle, yet I have\r\nobserved, they never so far forget, as to assail the bosoms of each\r\nother; where a few blows would be fatal to most of them. This, I know,\r\nsome derive from their being of a more bloody inclination than the\r\nmales. On which account they apply to the nose, as to the part whence\r\nblood may most easily be drawn; but this seems a far-fetched as well\r\nas ill-natured supposition.\r\n\r\nGoody Brown had great advantage of Molly in this particular; for the\r\nformer had indeed no breasts, her bosom (if it may be so called), as\r\nwell in colour as in many other properties, exactly resembling an\r\nantient piece of parchment, upon which any one might have drummed a\r\nconsiderable while without doing her any great damage.\r\n\r\nMolly, beside her present unhappy condition, was differently formed in\r\nthose parts, and might, perhaps, have tempted the envy of Brown to\r\ngive her a fatal blow, had not the lucky arrival of Tom Jones at this\r\ninstant put an immediate end to the bloody scene.\r\n\r\nThis accident was luckily owing to Mr Square; for he, Master Blifil,\r\nand Jones, had mounted their horses, after church, to take the air,\r\nand had ridden about a quarter of a mile, when Square, changing his\r\nmind (not idly, but for a reason which we shall unfold as soon as we\r\nhave leisure), desired the young gentlemen to ride with him another\r\nway than they had at first purposed. This motion being complied with,\r\nbrought them of necessity back again to the churchyard.\r\n\r\nMaster Blifil, who rode first, seeing such a mob assembled, and two\r\nwomen in the posture in which we left the combatants, stopt his horse\r\nto enquire what was the matter. A country fellow, scratching his head,\r\nanswered him: “I don't know, measter, un't I; an't please your honour,\r\nhere hath been a vight, I think, between Goody Brown and Moll\r\nSeagrim.”\r\n\r\n“Who, who?” cries Tom; but without waiting for an answer, having\r\ndiscovered the features of his Molly through all the discomposure in\r\nwhich they now were, he hastily alighted, turned his horse loose, and,\r\nleaping over the wall, ran to her. She now first bursting into tears,\r\ntold him how barbarously she had been treated. Upon which, forgetting\r\nthe sex of Goody Brown, or perhaps not knowing it in his rage--for, in\r\nreality, she had no feminine appearance but a petticoat, which he\r\nmight not observe--he gave her a lash or two with his horsewhip; and\r\nthen flying at the mob, who were all accused by Moll, he dealt his\r\nblows so profusely on all sides, that unless I would again invoke the\r\nmuse (which the good-natured reader may think a little too hard upon\r\nher, as she hath so lately been violently sweated), it would be\r\nimpossible for me to recount the horse-whipping of that day.\r\n\r\nHaving scoured the whole coast of the enemy, as well as any of Homer's\r\nheroes ever did, or as Don Quixote or any knight-errant in the world\r\ncould have done, he returned to Molly, whom he found in a condition\r\nwhich must give both me and my reader pain, was it to be described\r\nhere. Tom raved like a madman, beat his breast, tore his hair, stamped\r\non the ground, and vowed the utmost vengeance on all who had been\r\nconcerned. He then pulled off his coat, and buttoned it round her, put\r\nhis hat upon her head, wiped the blood from her face as well as he\r\ncould with his handkerchief, and called out to the servant to ride as\r\nfast as possible for a side-saddle, or a pillion, that he might carry\r\nher safe home.\r\n\r\nMaster Blifil objected to the sending away the servant, as they had\r\nonly one with them; but as Square seconded the order of Jones, he was\r\nobliged to comply.\r\n\r\nThe servant returned in a very short time with the pillion, and Molly,\r\nhaving collected her rags as well as she could, was placed behind him.\r\nIn which manner she was carried home, Square, Blifil, and Jones\r\nattending.\r\n\r\nHere Jones having received his coat, given her a sly kiss, and\r\nwhispered her, that he would return in the evening, quitted his Molly,\r\nand rode on after his companions."

      "content": "Containing matter of no very peaceable colour.\r\n\nMolly had no sooner apparelled herself in her accustomed rags, than\r\nher sisters began to fall violently upon her, particularly her eldest\r\nsister, who told her she was well enough served. “How had she the\r\nassurance to wear a gown which young Madam Western had given to\r\nmother! If one of us was to wear it, I think,” says she, “I myself\r\nhave the best right; but I warrant you think it belongs to your\r\nbeauty. I suppose you think yourself more handsomer than any of\r\nus.”--“Hand her down the bit of glass from over the cupboard,” cries\r\nanother; “I'd wash the blood from my face before I talked of my\r\nbeauty.”--“You'd better have minded what the parson says,” cries the\r\neldest, “and not a harkened after men voke.”--“Indeed, child, and so\r\nshe had,” says the mother, sobbing: “she hath brought a disgrace upon\r\nus all. She's the vurst of the vamily that ever was a whore.”\r\n\r\n“You need not upbraid me with that, mother,” cries Molly; “you\r\nyourself was brought-to-bed of sister there, within a week after you\r\nwas married.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, hussy,” answered the enraged mother, “so I was, and what was the\r\nmighty matter of that? I was made an honest woman then; and if you was\r\nto be made an honest woman, I should not be angry; but you must have\r\nto doing with a gentleman, you nasty slut; you will have a bastard,\r\nhussy, you will; and that I defy any one to say of me.”\r\n\r\nIn this situation Black George found his family, when he came home for\r\nthe purpose before mentioned. As his wife and three daughters were all\r\nof them talking together, and most of them crying, it was some time\r\nbefore he could get an opportunity of being heard; but as soon as such\r\nan interval occurred, he acquainted the company with what Sophia had\r\nsaid to him.\r\n\r\nGoody Seagrim then began to revile her daughter afresh. “Here,” says\r\nshe, “you have brought us into a fine quandary indeed. What will madam\r\nsay to that big belly? Oh that ever I should live to see this day!”\r\n\r\nMolly answered with great spirit, “And what is this mighty place which\r\nyou have got for me, father?” (for he had not well understood the\r\nphrase used by Sophia of being about her person). “I suppose it is to\r\nbe under the cook; but I shan't wash dishes for anybody. My gentleman\r\nwill provide better for me. See what he hath given me this afternoon.\r\nHe hath promised I shall never want money; and you shan't want money\r\nneither, mother, if you will hold your tongue, and know when you are\r\nwell.” And so saying, she pulled out several guineas, and gave her\r\nmother one of them.\r\n\r\nThe good woman no sooner felt the gold within her palm, than her\r\ntemper began (such is the efficacy of that panacea) to be mollified.\r\n“Why, husband,” says she, “would any but such a blockhead as you not\r\nhave enquired what place this was before he had accepted it? Perhaps,\r\nas Molly says, it may be in the kitchen; and truly I don't care my\r\ndaughter should be a scullion wench; for, poor as I am, I am a\r\ngentlewoman. And thof I was obliged, as my father, who was a\r\nclergyman, died worse than nothing, and so could not give me a\r\nshilling of _potion_, to undervalue myself by marrying a poor man; yet\r\nI would have you to know, I have a spirit above all them things. Marry\r\ncome up! it would better become Madam Western to look at home, and\r\nremember who her own grandfather was. Some of my family, for aught I\r\nknow, might ride in their coaches, when the grandfathers of some voke\r\nwalked a-voot. I warrant she fancies she did a mighty matter, when she\r\nsent us that old gownd; some of my family would not have picked up\r\nsuch rags in the street; but poor people are always trampled\r\nupon.--The parish need not have been in such a fluster with Molly. You\r\nmight have told them, child, your grandmother wore better things new\r\nout of the shop.”\r\n\r\n“Well, but consider,” cried George, “what answer shall I make to\r\nmadam?”\r\n\r\n“I don't know what answer,” says she; “you are always bringing your\r\nfamily into one quandary or other. Do you remember when you shot the\r\npartridge, the occasion of all our misfortunes? Did not I advise you\r\nnever to go into Squire Western's manor? Did not I tell you many a\r\ngood year ago what would come of it? But you would have your own\r\nheadstrong ways; yes, you would, you villain.”\r\n\r\nBlack George was, in the main, a peaceable kind of fellow, and nothing\r\ncholeric nor rash; yet did he bear about him something of what the\r\nantients called the irascible, and which his wife, if she had been\r\nendowed with much wisdom, would have feared. He had long experienced,\r\nthat when the storm grew very high, arguments were but wind, which\r\nserved rather to increase, than to abate it. He was therefore seldom\r\nunprovided with a small switch, a remedy of wonderful force, as he had\r\noften essayed, and which the word villain served as a hint for his\r\napplying.\r\n\r\nNo sooner, therefore, had this symptom appeared, than he had immediate\r\nrecourse to the said remedy, which though, as it is usual in all very\r\nefficacious medicines, it at first seemed to heighten and inflame the\r\ndisease, soon produced a total calm, and restored the patient to\r\nperfect ease and tranquillity.\r\n\r\nThis is, however, a kind of horse-medicine, which requires a very\r\nrobust constitution to digest, and is therefore proper only for the\r\nvulgar, unless in one single instance, viz., where superiority of\r\nbirth breaks out; in which case, we should not think it very\r\nimproperly applied by any husband whatever, if the application was not\r\nin itself so base, that, like certain applications of the physical\r\nkind which need not be mentioned, it so much degrades and contaminates\r\nthe hand employed in it, that no gentleman should endure the thought\r\nof anything so low and detestable.\r\n\r\nThe whole family were soon reduced to a state of perfect quiet; for\r\nthe virtue of this medicine, like that of electricity, is often\r\ncommunicated through one person to many others, who are not touched by\r\nthe instrument. To say the truth, as they both operate by friction, it\r\nmay be doubted whether there is not something analogous between them,\r\nof which Mr Freke would do well to enquire, before he publishes the\r\nnext edition of his book.\r\n\r\nA council was now called, in which, after many debates, Molly still\r\npersisting that she would not go to service, it was at length\r\nresolved, that Goody Seagrim herself should wait on Miss Western, and\r\nendeavour to procure the place for her eldest daughter, who declared\r\ngreat readiness to accept it: but Fortune, who seems to have been an\r\nenemy of this little family, afterwards put a stop to her promotion."

      "content": "A story told by Mr Supple, the curate. The penetration of Squire\r\nWestern. His great love for his daughter, and the return to it made by\r\nher.\r\n\nThe next morning Tom Jones hunted with Mr Western, and was at his\r\nreturn invited by that gentleman to dinner.\r\n\r\nThe lovely Sophia shone forth that day with more gaiety and\r\nsprightliness than usual. Her battery was certainly levelled at our\r\nheroe; though, I believe, she herself scarce yet knew her own\r\nintention; but if she had any design of charming him, she now\r\nsucceeded.\r\n\r\nMr Supple, the curate of Mr Allworthy's parish, made one of the\r\ncompany. He was a good-natured worthy man; but chiefly remarkable for\r\nhis great taciturnity at table, though his mouth was never shut at it.\r\nIn short, he had one of the best appetites in the world. However, the\r\ncloth was no sooner taken away, than he always made sufficient amends\r\nfor his silence: for he was a very hearty fellow; and his conversation\r\nwas often entertaining, never offensive.\r\n\r\nAt his first arrival, which was immediately before the entrance of the\r\nroast-beef, he had given an intimation that he had brought some news\r\nwith him, and was beginning to tell, that he came that moment from Mr\r\nAllworthy's, when the sight of the roast-beef struck him dumb,\r\npermitting him only to say grace, and to declare he must pay his\r\nrespect to the baronet, for so he called the sirloin.\r\n\r\nWhen dinner was over, being reminded by Sophia of his news, he began\r\nas follows: “I believe, lady, your ladyship observed a young woman at\r\nchurch yesterday at even-song, who was drest in one of your outlandish\r\ngarments; I think I have seen your ladyship in such a one. However, in\r\nthe country, such dresses are\r\n\r\n _Rara avis in terris, nigroque simillima cygno._\r\n\r\nThat is, madam, as much as to say, 'A rare bird upon the earth, and\r\nvery like a black swan.' The verse is in Juvenal. But to return to\r\nwhat I was relating. I was saying such garments are rare sights in the\r\ncountry; and perchance, too, it was thought the more rare, respect\r\nbeing had to the person who wore it, who, they tell me, is the\r\ndaughter of Black George, your worship's gamekeeper, whose sufferings,\r\nI should have opined, might have taught him more wit, than to dress\r\nforth his wenches in such gaudy apparel. She created so much confusion\r\nin the congregation, that if Squire Allworthy had not silenced it, it\r\nwould have interrupted the service: for I was once about to stop in\r\nthe middle of the first lesson. Howbeit, nevertheless, after prayer\r\nwas over, and I was departed home, this occasioned a battle in the\r\nchurchyard, where, amongst other mischief, the head of a travelling\r\nfidler was very much broken. This morning the fidler came to Squire\r\nAllworthy for a warrant, and the wench was brought before him. The\r\nsquire was inclined to have compounded matters; when, lo! on a sudden\r\nthe wench appeared (I ask your ladyship's pardon) to be, as it were,\r\nat the eve of bringing forth a bastard. The squire demanded of her who\r\nwas the father? But she pertinaciously refused to make any response.\r\nSo that he was about to make her mittimus to Bridewell when I\r\ndeparted.”\r\n\r\n“And is a wench having a bastard all your news, doctor?” cries\r\nWestern; “I thought it might have been some public matter, something\r\nabout the nation.”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid it is too common, indeed,” answered the parson; “but I\r\nthought the whole story altogether deserved commemorating. As to\r\nnational matters, your worship knows them best. My concerns extend no\r\nfarther than my own parish.”\r\n\r\n“Why, ay,” says the squire, “I believe I do know a little of that\r\nmatter, as you say. But, come, Tommy, drink about; the bottle stands\r\nwith you.”\r\n\r\nTom begged to be excused, for that he had particular business; and\r\ngetting up from table, escaped the clutches of the squire, who was\r\nrising to stop him, and went off with very little ceremony.\r\n\r\nThe squire gave him a good curse at his departure; and then turning to\r\nthe parson, he cried out, “I smoke it: I smoke it. Tom is certainly\r\nthe father of this bastard. Zooks, parson, you remember how he\r\nrecommended the veather o' her to me. D--n un, what a sly b--ch 'tis.\r\nAy, ay, as sure as two-pence, Tom is the veather of the bastard.”\r\n\r\n“I should be very sorry for that,” says the parson.\r\n\r\n“Why sorry,” cries the squire: “Where is the mighty matter o't? What,\r\nI suppose dost pretend that thee hast never got a bastard? Pox! more\r\ngood luck's thine? for I warrant hast a done a _therefore_ many's the\r\ngood time and often.”\r\n\r\n“Your worship is pleased to be jocular,” answered the parson; “but I\r\ndo not only animadvert on the sinfulness of the action--though that\r\nsurely is to be greatly deprecated--but I fear his unrighteousness may\r\ninjure him with Mr Allworthy. And truly I must say, though he hath the\r\ncharacter of being a little wild, I never saw any harm in the young\r\nman; nor can I say I have heard any, save what your worship now\r\nmentions. I wish, indeed, he was a little more regular in his\r\nresponses at church; but altogether he seems\r\n\r\n _Ingenui vultus puer ingenuique pudoris._\r\n\r\nThat is a classical line, young lady; and, being rendered into\r\nEnglish, is, `a lad of an ingenuous countenance, and of an ingenuous\r\nmodesty;' for this was a virtue in great repute both among the Latins\r\nand Greeks. I must say, the young gentleman (for so I think I may call\r\nhim, notwithstanding his birth) appears to me a very modest, civil\r\nlad, and I should be sorry that he should do himself any injury in\r\nSquire Allworthy's opinion.”\r\n\r\n“Poogh!” says the squire: “Injury, with Allworthy! Why, Allworthy\r\nloves a wench himself. Doth not all the country know whose son Tom is?\r\nYou must talk to another person in that manner. I remember Allworthy\r\nat college.”\r\n\r\n“I thought,” said the parson, “he had never been at the university.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, he was,” says the squire: “and many a wench have we two had\r\ntogether. As arrant a whore-master as any within five miles o'un. No,\r\nno. It will do'n no harm with he, assure yourself; nor with anybody\r\nelse. Ask Sophy there--You have not the worse opinion of a young\r\nfellow for getting a bastard, have you, girl? No, no, the women will\r\nlike un the better for't.”\r\n\r\nThis was a cruel question to poor Sophia. She had observed Tom's\r\ncolour change at the parson's story; and that, with his hasty and\r\nabrupt departure, gave her sufficient reason to think her father's\r\nsuspicion not groundless. Her heart now at once discovered the great\r\nsecret to her which it had been so long disclosing by little and\r\nlittle; and she found herself highly interested in this matter. In\r\nsuch a situation, her father's malapert question rushing suddenly upon\r\nher, produced some symptoms which might have alarmed a suspicious\r\nheart; but, to do the squire justice, that was not his fault. When she\r\nrose therefore from her chair, and told him a hint from him was always\r\nsufficient to make her withdraw, he suffered her to leave the room,\r\nand then with great gravity of countenance remarked, “That it was\r\nbetter to see a daughter over-modest than over-forward;”--a sentiment\r\nwhich was highly applauded by the parson.\r\n\r\nThere now ensued between the squire and the parson a most excellent\r\npolitical discourse, framed out of newspapers and political pamphlets;\r\nin which they made a libation of four bottles of wine to the good of\r\ntheir country: and then, the squire being fast asleep, the parson\r\nlighted his pipe, mounted his horse, and rode home.\r\n\r\nWhen the squire had finished his half-hour's nap, he summoned his\r\ndaughter to her harpsichord; but she begged to be excused that\r\nevening, on account of a violent head-ache. This remission was\r\npresently granted; for indeed she seldom had occasion to ask him\r\ntwice, as he loved her with such ardent affection, that, by gratifying\r\nher, he commonly conveyed the highest gratification to himself. She\r\nwas really, what he frequently called her, his little darling, and she\r\nwell deserved to be so; for she returned all his affection in the most\r\nample manner. She had preserved the most inviolable duty to him in all\r\nthings; and this her love made not only easy, but so delightful, that\r\nwhen one of her companions laughed at her for placing so much merit in\r\nsuch scrupulous obedience, as that young lady called it, Sophia\r\nanswered, “You mistake me, madam, if you think I value myself upon\r\nthis account; for besides that I am barely discharging my duty, I am\r\nlikewise pleasing myself. I can truly say I have no delight equal to\r\nthat of contributing to my father's happiness; and if I value myself,\r\nmy dear, it is on having this power, and not on executing it.”\r\n\r\nThis was a satisfaction, however, which poor Sophia was incapable of\r\ntasting this evening. She therefore not only desired to be excused\r\nfrom her attendance at the harpsichord, but likewise begged that he\r\nwould suffer her to absent herself from supper. To this request\r\nlikewise the squire agreed, though not without some reluctance; for he\r\nscarce ever permitted her to be out of his sight, unless when he was\r\nengaged with his horses, dogs, or bottle. Nevertheless he yielded to\r\nthe desire of his daughter, though the poor man was at the same time\r\nobliged to avoid his own company (if I may so express myself), by\r\nsending for a neighbouring farmer to sit with him."

      "content": "The narrow escape of Molly Seagrim, with some observations for which\r\nwe have been forced to dive pretty deep into nature.\r\n\nTom Jones had ridden one of Mr Western's horses that morning in the\r\nchase; so that having no horse of his own in the squire's stable, he\r\nwas obliged to go home on foot: this he did so expeditiously that he\r\nran upwards of three miles within the half-hour.\r\n\r\nJust as he arrived at Mr Allworthy's outward gate, he met the\r\nconstable and company with Molly in their possession, whom they were\r\nconducting to that house where the inferior sort of people may learn\r\none good lesson, viz., respect and deference to their superiors; since\r\nit must show them the wide distinction Fortune intends between those\r\npersons who are to be corrected for their faults, and those who are\r\nnot; which lesson if they do not learn, I am afraid they very rarely\r\nlearn any other good lesson, or improve their morals, at the house of\r\ncorrection.\r\n\r\nA lawyer may perhaps think Mr Allworthy exceeded his authority a\r\nlittle in this instance. And, to say the truth, I question, as here\r\nwas no regular information before him, whether his conduct was\r\nstrictly regular. However, as his intention was truly upright, he\r\nought to be excused in _foro conscientiae_; since so many arbitrary\r\nacts are daily committed by magistrates who have not this excuse to\r\nplead for themselves.\r\n\r\nTom was no sooner informed by the constable whither they were\r\nproceeding (indeed he pretty well guessed it of himself), than he\r\ncaught Molly in his arms, and embracing her tenderly before them all,\r\nswore he would murder the first man who offered to lay hold of her. He\r\nbid her dry her eyes and be comforted; for, wherever she went, he\r\nwould accompany her. Then turning to the constable, who stood\r\ntrembling with his hat off, he desired him, in a very mild voice, to\r\nreturn with him for a moment only to his father (for so he now called\r\nAllworthy); for he durst, he said, be assured, that, when he had\r\nalledged what he had to say in her favour, the girl would be\r\ndischarged.\r\n\r\nThe constable, who, I make no doubt, would have surrendered his\r\nprisoner had Tom demanded her, very readily consented to this request.\r\nSo back they all went into Mr Allworthy's hall; where Tom desired them\r\nto stay till his return, and then went himself in pursuit of the good\r\nman. As soon as he was found, Tom threw himself at his feet, and\r\nhaving begged a patient hearing, confessed himself to be the father of\r\nthe child of which Molly was then big. He entreated him to have\r\ncompassion on the poor girl, and to consider, if there was any guilt\r\nin the case, it lay principally at his door.\r\n\r\n“If there is any guilt in the case!” answered Allworthy warmly: “Are\r\nyou then so profligate and abandoned a libertine to doubt whether the\r\nbreaking the laws of God and man, the corrupting and ruining a poor\r\ngirl be guilt? I own, indeed, it doth lie principally upon you; and so\r\nheavy it is, that you ought to expect it should crush you.”\r\n\r\n“Whatever may be my fate,” says Tom, “let me succeed in my\r\nintercessions for the poor girl. I confess I have corrupted her! but\r\nwhether she shall be ruined, depends on you. For Heaven's sake, sir,\r\nrevoke your warrant, and do not send her to a place which must\r\nunavoidably prove her destruction.”\r\n\r\nAllworthy bid him immediately call a servant. Tom answered there was\r\nno occasion; for he had luckily met them at the gate, and relying upon\r\nhis goodness, had brought them all back into his hall, where they now\r\nwaited his final resolution, which upon his knees he besought him\r\nmight be in favour of the girl; that she might be permitted to go home\r\nto her parents, and not be exposed to a greater degree of shame and\r\nscorn than must necessarily fall upon her. “I know,” said he, “that is\r\ntoo much. I know I am the wicked occasion of it. I will endeavour to\r\nmake amends, if possible; and if you shall have hereafter the goodness\r\nto forgive me, I hope I shall deserve it.”\r\n\r\nAllworthy hesitated some time, and at last said, “Well, I will\r\ndischarge my mittimus.--You may send the constable to me.” He was\r\ninstantly called, discharged, and so was the girl.\r\n\r\nIt will be believed that Mr Allworthy failed not to read Tom a very\r\nsevere lecture on this occasion; but it is unnecessary to insert it\r\nhere, as we have faithfully transcribed what he said to Jenny Jones in\r\nthe first book, most of which may be applied to the men, equally with\r\nthe women. So sensible an effect had these reproofs on the young man,\r\nwho was no hardened sinner, that he retired to his own room, where he\r\npassed the evening alone, in much melancholy contemplation.\r\n\r\nAllworthy was sufficiently offended by this transgression of Jones;\r\nfor notwithstanding the assertions of Mr Western, it is certain this\r\nworthy man had never indulged himself in any loose pleasures with\r\nwomen, and greatly condemned the vice of incontinence in others.\r\nIndeed, there is much reason to imagine that there was not the least\r\ntruth in what Mr Western affirmed, especially as he laid the scene of\r\nthose impurities at the university, where Mr Allworthy had never been.\r\nIn fact, the good squire was a little too apt to indulge that kind of\r\npleasantry which is generally called rhodomontade: but which may, with\r\nas much propriety, be expressed by a much shorter word; and perhaps we\r\ntoo often supply the use of this little monosyllable by others; since\r\nvery much of what frequently passes in the world for wit and humour,\r\nshould, in the strictest purity of language, receive that short\r\nappellation, which, in conformity to the well-bred laws of custom, I\r\nhere suppress.\r\n\r\nBut whatever detestation Mr Allworthy had to this or to any other\r\nvice, he was not so blinded by it but that he could discern any virtue\r\nin the guilty person, as clearly indeed as if there had been no\r\nmixture of vice in the same character. While he was angry therefore\r\nwith the incontinence of Jones, he was no less pleased with the honour\r\nand honesty of his self-accusation. He began now to form in his mind\r\nthe same opinion of this young fellow, which, we hope, our reader may\r\nhave conceived. And in balancing his faults with his perfections, the\r\nlatter seemed rather to preponderate.\r\n\r\nIt was to no purpose, therefore, that Thwackum, who was immediately\r\ncharged by Mr Blifil with the story, unbended all his rancour against\r\npoor Tom. Allworthy gave a patient hearing to their invectives, and\r\nthen answered coldly: “That young men of Tom's complexion were too\r\ngenerally addicted to this vice; but he believed that youth was\r\nsincerely affected with what he had said to him on the occasion, and\r\nhe hoped he would not transgress again.” So that, as the days of\r\nwhipping were at an end, the tutor had no other vent but his own mouth\r\nfor his gall, the usual poor resource of impotent revenge.\r\n\r\nBut Square, who was a less violent, was a much more artful man; and as\r\nhe hated Jones more perhaps than Thwackum himself did, so he contrived\r\nto do him more mischief in the mind of Mr Allworthy.\r\n\r\nThe reader must remember the several little incidents of the\r\npartridge, the horse, and the Bible, which were recounted in the\r\nsecond book. By all which Jones had rather improved than injured the\r\naffection which Mr Allworthy was inclined to entertain for him. The\r\nsame, I believe, must have happened to him with every other person who\r\nhath any idea of friendship, generosity, and greatness of spirit, that\r\nis to say, who hath any traces of goodness in his mind.\r\n\r\nSquare himself was not unacquainted with the true impression which\r\nthose several instances of goodness had made on the excellent heart of\r\nAllworthy; for the philosopher very well knew what virtue was, though\r\nhe was not always perhaps steady in its pursuit; but as for Thwackum,\r\nfrom what reason I will not determine, no such thoughts ever entered\r\ninto his head: he saw Jones in a bad light, and he imagined Allworthy\r\nsaw him in the same, but that he was resolved, from pride and\r\nstubbornness of spirit, not to give up the boy whom he had once\r\ncherished; since by so doing, he must tacitly acknowledge that his\r\nformer opinion of him had been wrong.\r\n\r\nSquare therefore embraced this opportunity of injuring Jones\r\nin the tenderest part, by giving a very bad turn to all these\r\nbefore-mentioned occurrences. “I am sorry, sir,” said he, “to own I\r\nhave been deceived as well as yourself. I could not, I confess, help\r\nbeing pleased with what I ascribed to the motive of friendship, though\r\nit was carried to an excess, and all excess is faulty and vicious: but\r\nin this I made allowance for youth. Little did I suspect that the\r\nsacrifice of truth, which we both imagined to have been made to\r\nfriendship, was in reality a prostitution of it to a depraved and\r\ndebauched appetite. You now plainly see whence all the seeming\r\ngenerosity of this young man to the family of the gamekeeper\r\nproceeded. He supported the father in order to corrupt the daughter,\r\nand preserved the family from starving, to bring one of them to shame\r\nand ruin. This is friendship! this is generosity! As Sir Richard\r\nSteele says, `Gluttons who give high prices for delicacies, are very\r\nworthy to be called generous.' In short I am resolved, from this\r\ninstance, never to give way to the weakness of human nature more, nor\r\nto think anything virtue which doth not exactly quadrate with the\r\nunerring rule of right.”\r\n\r\nThe goodness of Allworthy had prevented those considerations from\r\noccurring to himself; yet were they too plausible to be absolutely and\r\nhastily rejected, when laid before his eyes by another. Indeed what\r\nSquare had said sunk very deeply into his mind, and the uneasiness\r\nwhich it there created was very visible to the other; though the good\r\nman would not acknowledge this, but made a very slight answer, and\r\nforcibly drove off the discourse to some other subject. It was well\r\nperhaps for poor Tom, that no such suggestions had been made before he\r\nwas pardoned; for they certainly stamped in the mind of Allworthy the\r\nfirst bad impression concerning Jones."

      "content": "Containing much clearer matters; but which flowed from the same\r\nfountain with those in the preceding chapter.\r\n\nThe reader will be pleased, I believe, to return with me to Sophia.\r\nShe passed the night, after we saw her last, in no very agreeable\r\nmanner. Sleep befriended her but little, and dreams less. In the\r\nmorning, when Mrs Honour, her maid, attended her at the usual hour,\r\nshe was found already up and drest.\r\n\r\nPersons who live two or three miles' distance in the country are\r\nconsidered as next-door neighbours, and transactions at the one house\r\nfly with incredible celerity to the other. Mrs Honour, therefore, had\r\nheard the whole story of Molly's shame; which she, being of a very\r\ncommunicative temper, had no sooner entered the apartment of her\r\nmistress, than she began to relate in the following manner:--\r\n\r\n“La, ma'am, what doth your la'ship think? the girl that your la'ship\r\nsaw at church on Sunday, whom you thought so handsome; though you\r\nwould not have thought her so handsome neither, if you had seen her\r\nnearer, but to be sure she hath been carried before the justice for\r\nbeing big with child. She seemed to me to look like a confident slut:\r\nand to be sure she hath laid the child to young Mr Jones. And all the\r\nparish says Mr Allworthy is so angry with young Mr Jones, that he\r\nwon't see him. To be sure, one can't help pitying the poor young man,\r\nand yet he doth not deserve much pity neither, for demeaning himself\r\nwith such kind of trumpery. Yet he is so pretty a gentleman, I should\r\nbe sorry to have him turned out of doors. I dares to swear the wench\r\nwas as willing as he; for she was always a forward kind of body. And\r\nwhen wenches are so coming, young men are not so much to be blamed\r\nneither; for to be sure they do no more than what is natural. Indeed\r\nit is beneath them to meddle with such dirty draggle-tails; and\r\nwhatever happens to them, it is good enough for them. And yet, to be\r\nsure, the vile baggages are most in fault. I wishes, with all my\r\nheart, they were well to be whipped at the cart's tail; for it is pity\r\nthey should be the ruin of a pretty young gentleman; and nobody can\r\ndeny but that Mr Jones is one of the most handsomest young men that\r\never----”\r\n\r\nShe was running on thus, when Sophia, with a more peevish voice than\r\nshe had ever spoken to her in before, cried, “Prithee, why dost thou\r\ntrouble me with all this stuff? What concern have I in what Mr Jones\r\ndoth? I suppose you are all alike. And you seem to me to be angry it\r\nwas not your own case.”\r\n\r\n“I, ma'am!” answered Mrs Honour, “I am sorry your ladyship should have\r\nsuch an opinion of me. I am sure nobody can say any such thing of me.\r\nAll the young fellows in the world may go to the divil for me. Because\r\nI said he was a handsome man? Everybody says it as well as I. To be\r\nsure, I never thought as it was any harm to say a young man was\r\nhandsome; but to be sure I shall never think him so any more now; for\r\nhandsome is that handsome does. A beggar wench!--”\r\n\r\n“Stop thy torrent of impertinence,” cries Sophia, “and see whether my\r\nfather wants me at breakfast.”\r\n\r\nMrs Honour then flung out of the room, muttering much to herself, of\r\nwhich “Marry come up, I assure you,” was all that could be plainly\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\nWhether Mrs Honour really deserved that suspicion, of which her\r\nmistress gave her a hint, is a matter which we cannot indulge our\r\nreader's curiosity by resolving. We will, however, make him amends in\r\ndisclosing what passed in the mind of Sophia.\r\n\r\nThe reader will be pleased to recollect, that a secret affection for\r\nMr Jones had insensibly stolen into the bosom of this young lady. That\r\nit had there grown to a pretty great height before she herself had\r\ndiscovered it. When she first began to perceive its symptoms, the\r\nsensations were so sweet and pleasing, that she had not resolution\r\nsufficient to check or repel them; and thus she went on cherishing a\r\npassion of which she never once considered the consequences.\r\n\r\nThis incident relating to Molly first opened her eyes. She now first\r\nperceived the weakness of which she had been guilty; and though it\r\ncaused the utmost perturbation in her mind, yet it had the effect of\r\nother nauseous physic, and for the time expelled her distemper. Its\r\noperation indeed was most wonderfully quick; and in the short\r\ninterval, while her maid was absent, so entirely removed all symptoms,\r\nthat when Mrs Honour returned with a summons from her father, she was\r\nbecome perfectly easy, and had brought herself to a thorough\r\nindifference for Mr Jones.\r\n\r\nThe diseases of the mind do in almost every particular imitate those\r\nof the body. For which reason, we hope, that learned faculty, for whom\r\nwe have so profound a respect, will pardon us the violent hands we\r\nhave been necessitated to lay on several words and phrases, which of\r\nright belong to them, and without which our descriptions must have\r\nbeen often unintelligible.\r\n\r\nNow there is no one circumstance in which the distempers of the mind\r\nbear a more exact analogy to those which are called bodily, than that\r\naptness which both have to a relapse. This is plain in the violent\r\ndiseases of ambition and avarice. I have known ambition, when cured at\r\ncourt by frequent disappointments (which are the only physic for it),\r\nto break out again in a contest for foreman of the grand jury at an\r\nassizes; and have heard of a man who had so far conquered avarice, as\r\nto give away many a sixpence, that comforted himself, at last, on his\r\ndeathbed, by making a crafty and advantageous bargain concerning his\r\nensuing funeral, with an undertaker who had married his only child.\r\n\r\nIn the affair of love, which, out of strict conformity with the Stoic\r\nphilosophy, we shall here treat as a disease, this proneness to\r\nrelapse is no less conspicuous. Thus it happened to poor Sophia; upon\r\nwhom, the very next time she saw young Jones, all the former symptoms\r\nreturned, and from that time cold and hot fits alternately seized her\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nThe situation of this young lady was now very different from what it\r\nhad ever been before. That passion which had formerly been so\r\nexquisitely delicious, became now a scorpion in her bosom. She\r\nresisted it therefore with her utmost force, and summoned every\r\nargument her reason (which was surprisingly strong for her age) could\r\nsuggest, to subdue and expel it. In this she so far succeeded, that\r\nshe began to hope from time and absence a perfect cure. She resolved\r\ntherefore to avoid Tom Jones as much as possible; for which purpose\r\nshe began to conceive a design of visiting her aunt, to which she made\r\nno doubt of obtaining her father's consent.\r\n\r\nBut Fortune, who had other designs in her head, put an immediate stop\r\nto any such proceeding, by introducing an accident, which will be\r\nrelated in the next chapter."

      "content": "A dreadful accident which befel Sophia. The gallant behaviour of\r\nJones, and the more dreadful consequence of that behaviour to the\r\nyoung lady; with a short digression in favour of the female sex.\r\n\nMr Western grew every day fonder and fonder of Sophia, insomuch that\r\nhis beloved dogs themselves almost gave place to her in his\r\naffections; but as he could not prevail on himself to abandon these,\r\nhe contrived very cunningly to enjoy their company, together with that\r\nof his daughter, by insisting on her riding a hunting with him.\r\n\r\nSophia, to whom her father's word was a law, readily complied with his\r\ndesires, though she had not the least delight in a sport, which was of\r\ntoo rough and masculine a nature to suit with her disposition. She had\r\nhowever another motive, beside her obedience, to accompany the old\r\ngentleman in the chase; for by her presence she hoped in some measure\r\nto restrain his impetuosity, and to prevent him from so frequently\r\nexposing his neck to the utmost hazard.\r\n\r\nThe strongest objection was that which would have formerly been an\r\ninducement to her, namely, the frequent meeting with young Jones, whom\r\nshe had determined to avoid; but as the end of the hunting season now\r\napproached, she hoped, by a short absence with her aunt, to reason\r\nherself entirely out of her unfortunate passion; and had not any doubt\r\nof being able to meet him in the field the subsequent season without\r\nthe least danger.\r\n\r\nOn the second day of her hunting, as she was returning from the chase,\r\nand was arrived within a little distance from Mr Western's house, her\r\nhorse, whose mettlesome spirit required a better rider, fell suddenly\r\nto prancing and capering in such a manner that she was in the most\r\nimminent peril of falling. Tom Jones, who was at a little distance\r\nbehind, saw this, and immediately galloped up to her assistance. As\r\nsoon as he came up, he leapt from his own horse, and caught hold of\r\nhers by the bridle. The unruly beast presently reared himself an end\r\non his hind legs, and threw his lovely burthen from his back, and\r\nJones caught her in his arms.\r\n\r\nShe was so affected with the fright, that she was not immediately able\r\nto satisfy Jones, who was very solicitous to know whether she had\r\nreceived any hurt. She soon after, however, recovered her spirits,\r\nassured him she was safe, and thanked him for the care he had taken of\r\nher. Jones answered, “If I have preserved you, madam, I am\r\nsufficiently repaid; for I promise you, I would have secured you from\r\nthe least harm at the expense of a much greater misfortune to myself\r\nthan I have suffered on this occasion.”\r\n\r\n“What misfortune?” replied Sophia eagerly; “I hope you have come to no\r\nmischief?”\r\n\r\n“Be not concerned, madam,” answered Jones. “Heaven be praised you have\r\nescaped so well, considering the danger you was in. If I have broke my\r\narm, I consider it as a trifle, in comparison of what I feared upon\r\nyour account.”\r\n\r\nSophia then screamed out, “Broke your arm! Heaven forbid.”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid I have, madam,” says Jones: “but I beg you will suffer me\r\nfirst to take care of you. I have a right hand yet at your service, to\r\nhelp you into the next field, whence we have but a very little walk to\r\nyour father's house.”\r\n\r\nSophia seeing his left arm dangling by his side, while he was using\r\nthe other to lead her, no longer doubted of the truth. She now grew\r\nmuch paler than her fears for herself had made her before. All her\r\nlimbs were seized with a trembling, insomuch that Jones could scarce\r\nsupport her; and as her thoughts were in no less agitation, she could\r\nnot refrain from giving Jones a look so full of tenderness, that it\r\nalmost argued a stronger sensation in her mind, than even gratitude\r\nand pity united can raise in the gentlest female bosom, without the\r\nassistance of a third more powerful passion.\r\n\r\nMr Western, who was advanced at some distance when this accident\r\nhappened, was now returned, as were the rest of the horsemen. Sophia\r\nimmediately acquainted them with what had befallen Jones, and begged\r\nthem to take care of him. Upon which Western, who had been much\r\nalarmed by meeting his daughter's horse without its rider, and was now\r\noverjoyed to find her unhurt, cried out, “I am glad it is no worse. If\r\nTom hath broken his arm, we will get a joiner to mend un again.”\r\n\r\nThe squire alighted from his horse, and proceeded to his house on\r\nfoot, with his daughter and Jones. An impartial spectator, who had met\r\nthem on the way, would, on viewing their several countenances, have\r\nconcluded Sophia alone to have been the object of compassion: for as\r\nto Jones, he exulted in having probably saved the life of the young\r\nlady, at the price only of a broken bone; and Mr Western, though he\r\nwas not unconcerned at the accident which had befallen Jones, was,\r\nhowever, delighted in a much higher degree with the fortunate escape\r\nof his daughter.\r\n\r\nThe generosity of Sophia's temper construed this behaviour of Jones\r\ninto great bravery; and it made a deep impression on her heart: for\r\ncertain it is, that there is no one quality which so generally\r\nrecommends men to women as this; proceeding, if we believe the common\r\nopinion, from that natural timidity of the sex, which is, says Mr\r\nOsborne, “so great, that a woman is the most cowardly of all the\r\ncreatures God ever made;”--a sentiment more remarkable for its\r\nbluntness than for its truth. Aristotle, in his Politics, doth them, I\r\nbelieve, more justice, when he says, “The modesty and fortitude of men\r\ndiffer from those virtues in women; for the fortitude which becomes a\r\nwoman, would be cowardice in a man; and the modesty which becomes a\r\nman, would be pertness in a woman.” Nor is there, perhaps, more of\r\ntruth in the opinion of those who derive the partiality which women\r\nare inclined to show to the brave, from this excess of their fear. Mr\r\nBayle (I think, in his article of Helen) imputes this, and with\r\ngreater probability, to their violent love of glory; for the truth of\r\nwhich, we have the authority of him who of all others saw farthest\r\ninto human nature, and who introduces the heroine of his Odyssey, the\r\ngreat pattern of matrimonial love and constancy, assigning the glory\r\nof her husband as the only source of her affection towards him.[*]\r\n\r\n [*] The English reader will not find this in the poem; for the\r\n sentiment is entirely left out in the translation.\r\n\r\nHowever this be, certain it is that the accident operated very\r\nstrongly on Sophia; and, indeed, after much enquiry into the matter, I\r\nam inclined to believe, that, at this very time, the charming Sophia\r\nmade no less impression on the heart of Jones; to say truth, he had\r\nfor some time become sensible of the irresistible power of her charms."

      "content": "The arrival of a surgeon.--His operations, and a long dialogue between\r\nSophia and her maid.\r\n\nWhen they arrived at Mr Western's hall, Sophia, who had tottered along\r\nwith much difficulty, sunk down in her chair; but by the assistance of\r\nhartshorn and water, she was prevented from fainting away, and had\r\npretty well recovered her spirits, when the surgeon who was sent for\r\nto Jones appeared. Mr Western, who imputed these symptoms in his\r\ndaughter to her fall, advised her to be presently blooded by way of\r\nprevention. In this opinion he was seconded by the surgeon, who gave\r\nso many reasons for bleeding, and quoted so many cases where persons\r\nhad miscarried for want of it, that the squire became very\r\nimportunate, and indeed insisted peremptorily that his daughter should\r\nbe blooded.\r\n\r\nSophia soon yielded to the commands of her father, though entirely\r\ncontrary to her own inclinations, for she suspected, I believe, less\r\ndanger from the fright, than either the squire or the surgeon. She\r\nthen stretched out her beautiful arm, and the operator began to\r\nprepare for his work.\r\n\r\nWhile the servants were busied in providing materials, the surgeon,\r\nwho imputed the backwardness which had appeared in Sophia to her\r\nfears, began to comfort her with assurances that there was not the\r\nleast danger; for no accident, he said, could ever happen in bleeding,\r\nbut from the monstrous ignorance of pretenders to surgery, which he\r\npretty plainly insinuated was not at present to be apprehended. Sophia\r\ndeclared she was not under the least apprehension; adding, “If you\r\nopen an artery, I promise you I'll forgive you.” “Will you?” cries\r\nWestern: “D--n me, if I will. If he does thee the least mischief, d--n\r\nme if I don't ha' the heart's blood o'un out.” The surgeon assented to\r\nbleed her upon these conditions, and then proceeded to his operation,\r\nwhich he performed with as much dexterity as he had promised; and with\r\nas much quickness: for he took but little blood from her, saying, it\r\nwas much safer to bleed again and again, than to take away too much at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nSophia, when her arm was bound up, retired: for she was not willing\r\n(nor was it, perhaps, strictly decent) to be present at the operation\r\non Jones. Indeed, one objection which she had to bleeding (though she\r\ndid not make it) was the delay which it would occasion to setting the\r\nbroken bone. For Western, when Sophia was concerned, had no\r\nconsideration but for her; and as for Jones himself, he “sat like\r\npatience on a monument smiling at grief.” To say the truth, when he\r\nsaw the blood springing from the lovely arm of Sophia, he scarce\r\nthought of what had happened to himself.\r\n\r\nThe surgeon now ordered his patient to be stript to his shirt, and\r\nthen entirely baring the arm, he began to stretch and examine it, in\r\nsuch a manner that the tortures he put him to caused Jones to make\r\nseveral wry faces; which the surgeon observing, greatly wondered at,\r\ncrying, “What is the matter, sir? I am sure it is impossible I should\r\nhurt you.” And then holding forth the broken arm, he began a long and\r\nvery learned lecture of anatomy, in which simple and double fractures\r\nwere most accurately considered; and the several ways in which Jones\r\nmight have broken his arm were discussed, with proper annotations\r\nshowing how many of these would have been better, and how many worse\r\nthan the present case.\r\n\r\nHaving at length finished his laboured harangue, with which the\r\naudience, though it had greatly raised their attention and admiration,\r\nwere not much edified, as they really understood not a single syllable\r\nof all he had said, he proceeded to business, which he was more\r\nexpeditious in finishing, than he had been in beginning.\r\n\r\nJones was then ordered into a bed, which Mr Western compelled him to\r\naccept at his own house, and sentence of water-gruel was passed upon\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAmong the good company which had attended in the hall during the\r\nbone-setting, Mrs Honour was one; who being summoned to her mistress\r\nas soon as it was over, and asked by her how the young gentleman did,\r\npresently launched into extravagant praises on the magnanimity, as she\r\ncalled it, of his behaviour, which, she said, “was so charming in so\r\npretty a creature.” She then burst forth into much warmer encomiums on\r\nthe beauty of his person; enumerating many particulars, and ending\r\nwith the whiteness of his skin.\r\n\r\nThis discourse had an effect on Sophia's countenance, which would not\r\nperhaps have escaped the observance of the sagacious waiting-woman,\r\nhad she once looked her mistress in the face, all the time she was\r\nspeaking: but as a looking-glass, which was most commodiously placed\r\nopposite to her, gave her an opportunity of surveying those features,\r\nin which, of all others, she took most delight; so she had not once\r\nremoved her eyes from that amiable object during her whole speech.\r\n\r\nMrs Honour was so intirely wrapped up in the subject on which she\r\nexercised her tongue, and the object before her eyes, that she gave\r\nher mistress time to conquer her confusion; which having done, she\r\nsmiled on her maid, and told her, “she was certainly in love with this\r\nyoung fellow.”--“I in love, madam!” answers she: “upon my word, ma'am,\r\nI assure you, ma'am, upon my soul, ma'am, I am not.”--“Why, if you\r\nwas,” cries her mistress, “I see no reason that you should be ashamed\r\nof it; for he is certainly a pretty fellow.”--“Yes, ma'am,” answered\r\nthe other, “that he is, the most handsomest man I ever saw in my life.\r\nYes, to be sure, that he is, and, as your ladyship says, I don't know\r\nwhy I should be ashamed of loving him, though he is my betters. To be\r\nsure, gentlefolks are but flesh and blood no more than us servants.\r\nBesides, as for Mr Jones, thof Squire Allworthy hath made a gentleman\r\nof him, he was not so good as myself by birth: for thof I am a poor\r\nbody, I am an honest person's child, and my father and mother were\r\nmarried, which is more than some people can say, as high as they hold\r\ntheir heads. Marry, come up! I assure you, my dirty cousin! thof his\r\nskin be so white, and to be sure it is the most whitest that ever was\r\nseen, I am a Christian as well as he, and nobody can say that I am\r\nbase born: my grandfather was a clergyman,[*] and would have been very\r\nangry, I believe, to have thought any of his family should have taken\r\nup with Molly Seagrim's dirty leavings.”\r\n\r\n [*] This is the second person of low condition whom we have recorded\r\n in this history to have sprung from the clergy. It is to be hoped\r\n such instances will, in future ages, when some provision is made for\r\n the families of the inferior clergy, appear stranger than they can\r\n be thought at present.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Sophia might have suffered her maid to run on in this manner,\r\nfrom wanting sufficient spirits to stop her tongue, which the reader\r\nmay probably conjecture was no very easy task; for certainly there\r\nwere some passages in her speech which were far from being agreeable\r\nto the lady. However, she now checked the torrent, as there seemed no\r\nend of its flowing. “I wonder,” says she, “at your assurance in daring\r\nto talk thus of one of my father's friends. As to the wench, I order\r\nyou never to mention her name to me. And with regard to the young\r\ngentleman's birth, those who can say nothing more to his disadvantage,\r\nmay as well be silent on that head, as I desire you will be for the\r\nfuture.”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry I have offended your ladyship,” answered Mrs Honour. “I am\r\nsure I hate Molly Seagrim as much as your ladyship can; and as for\r\nabusing Squire Jones, I can call all the servants in the house to\r\nwitness, that whenever any talk hath been about bastards, I have\r\nalways taken his part; for which of you, says I to the footmen, would\r\nnot be a bastard, if he could, to be made a gentleman of? And, says I,\r\nI am sure he is a very fine gentleman; and he hath one of the whitest\r\nhands in the world; for to be sure so he hath: and, says I, one of the\r\nsweetest temperedest, best naturedest men in the world he is; and,\r\nsays I, all the servants and neighbours all round the country loves\r\nhim. And, to be sure, I could tell your ladyship something, but that I\r\nam afraid it would offend you.”--“What could you tell me, Honour?”\r\n says Sophia. “Nay, ma'am, to be sure he meant nothing by it, therefore\r\nI would not have your ladyship be offended.”--“Prithee tell me,” says\r\nSophia; “I will know it this instant.”--“Why, ma'am,” answered Mrs\r\nHonour, “he came into the room one day last week when I was at work,\r\nand there lay your ladyship's muff on a chair, and to be sure he put\r\nhis hands into it; that very muff your ladyship gave me but yesterday.\r\nLa! says I, Mr Jones, you will stretch my lady's muff, and spoil it:\r\nbut he still kept his hands in it: and then he kissed it--to be sure I\r\nhardly ever saw such a kiss in my life as he gave it.”--“I suppose he\r\ndid not know it was mine,” replied Sophia. “Your ladyship shall hear,\r\nma'am. He kissed it again and again, and said it was the prettiest\r\nmuff in the world. La! sir, says I, you have seen it a hundred times.\r\nYes, Mrs Honour, cried he; but who can see anything beautiful in the\r\npresence of your lady but herself?--Nay, that's not all neither; but I\r\nhope your ladyship won't be offended, for to be sure he meant nothing.\r\nOne day, as your ladyship was playing on the harpsichord to my master,\r\nMr Jones was sitting in the next room, and methought he looked\r\nmelancholy. La! says I, Mr Jones, what's the matter? a penny for your\r\nthoughts, says I. Why, hussy, says he, starting up from a dream, what\r\ncan I be thinking of, when that angel your mistress is playing? And\r\nthen squeezing me by the hand, Oh! Mrs Honour, says he, how happy will\r\nthat man be!--and then he sighed. Upon my troth, his breath is as\r\nsweet as a nosegay.--But to be sure he meant no harm by it. So I hope\r\nyour ladyship will not mention a word; for he gave me a crown never to\r\nmention it, and made me swear upon a book, but I believe, indeed, it\r\nwas not the Bible.”\r\n\r\nTill something of a more beautiful red than vermilion be found out, I\r\nshall say nothing of Sophia's colour on this occasion. “Ho--nour,”\r\n says she, “I--if you will not mention this any more to me--nor to\r\nanybody else, I will not betray you--I mean, I will not be angry; but\r\nI am afraid of your tongue. Why, my girl, will you give it such\r\nliberties?”--“Nay, ma'am,” answered she, “to be sure, I would sooner\r\ncut out my tongue than offend your ladyship. To be sure I shall never\r\nmention a word that your ladyship would not have me.”--“Why, I would\r\nnot have you mention this any more,” said Sophia, “for it may come to\r\nmy father's ears, and he would be angry with Mr Jones; though I really\r\nbelieve, as you say, he meant nothing. I should be very angry myself,\r\nif I imagined--“--“Nay, ma'am,” says Honour, “I protest I believe he\r\nmeant nothing. I thought he talked as if he was out of his senses;\r\nnay, he said he believed he was beside himself when he had spoken the\r\nwords. Ay, sir, says I, I believe so too. Yes, says he, Honour.--But I\r\nask your ladyship's pardon; I could tear my tongue out for offending\r\nyou.” “Go on,” says Sophia; “you may mention anything you have not\r\ntold me before.”--“Yes, Honour, says he (this was some time\r\nafterwards, when he gave me the crown), I am neither such a coxcomb,\r\nor such a villain, as to think of her in any other delight but as my\r\ngoddess; as such I will always worship and adore her while I have\r\nbreath.--This was all, ma'am, I will be sworn, to the best of my\r\nremembrance. I was in a passion with him myself, till I found he meant\r\nno harm.”--“Indeed, Honour,” says Sophia, “I believe you have a real\r\naffection for me. I was provoked the other day when I gave you\r\nwarning; but if you have a desire to stay with me, you shall.”--“To be\r\nsure, ma'am,” answered Mrs Honour, “I shall never desire to part with\r\nyour ladyship. To be sure, I almost cried my eyes out when you gave me\r\nwarning. It would be very ungrateful in me to desire to leave your\r\nladyship; because as why, I should never get so good a place again. I\r\nam sure I would live and die with your ladyship; for, as poor Mr Jones\r\nsaid, happy is the man----”\r\n\r\nHere the dinner bell interrupted a conversation which had wrought such\r\nan effect on Sophia, that she was, perhaps, more obliged to her\r\nbleeding in the morning, than she, at the time, had apprehended she\r\nshould be. As to the present situation of her mind, I shall adhere to\r\na rule of Horace, by not attempting to describe it, from despair of\r\nsuccess. Most of my readers will suggest it easily to themselves; and\r\nthe few who cannot, would not understand the picture, or at least\r\nwould deny it to be natural, if ever so well drawn.\r\n\nBOOK V.\r\n\r\nCONTAINING A PORTION OF TIME SOMEWHAT LONGER THAN HALF A YEAR."

      "content": "Of the SERIOUS in writing, and for what purpose it is introduced.\r\n\nPeradventure there may be no parts in this prodigious work which will\r\ngive the reader less pleasure in the perusing, than those which have\r\ngiven the author the greatest pains in composing. Among these probably\r\nmay be reckoned those initial essays which we have prefixed to the\r\nhistorical matter contained in every book; and which we have\r\ndetermined to be essentially necessary to this kind of writing, of\r\nwhich we have set ourselves at the head.\r\n\r\nFor this our determination we do not hold ourselves strictly bound to\r\nassign any reason; it being abundantly sufficient that we have laid it\r\ndown as a rule necessary to be observed in all prosai-comi-epic\r\nwriting. Who ever demanded the reasons of that nice unity of time or\r\nplace which is now established to be so essential to dramatic poetry?\r\nWhat critic hath been ever asked, why a play may not contain two days\r\nas well as one? Or why the audience (provided they travel, like\r\nelectors, without any expense) may not be wafted fifty miles as well\r\nas five? Hath any commentator well accounted for the limitation which\r\nan antient critic hath set to the drama, which he will have contain\r\nneither more nor less than five acts? Or hath any one living attempted\r\nto explain what the modern judges of our theatres mean by that word\r\n_low_; by which they have happily succeeded in banishing all humour\r\nfrom the stage, and have made the theatre as dull as a drawing-room!\r\nUpon all these occasions the world seems to have embraced a maxim of\r\nour law, viz., _cuicunque in arte sua perito credendum est:_ for it\r\nseems perhaps difficult to conceive that any one should have had\r\nenough of impudence to lay down dogmatical rules in any art or science\r\nwithout the least foundation. In such cases, therefore, we are apt to\r\nconclude there are sound and good reasons at the bottom, though we are\r\nunfortunately not able to see so far.\r\n\r\nNow, in reality, the world have paid too great a compliment to\r\ncritics, and have imagined them men of much greater profundity than\r\nthey really are. From this complacence, the critics have been\r\nemboldened to assume a dictatorial power, and have so far succeeded,\r\nthat they are now become the masters, and have the assurance to give\r\nlaws to those authors from whose predecessors they originally received\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe critic, rightly considered, is no more than the clerk, whose\r\noffice it is to transcribe the rules and laws laid down by those great\r\njudges whose vast strength of genius hath placed them in the light of\r\nlegislators, in the several sciences over which they presided. This\r\noffice was all which the critics of old aspired to; nor did they ever\r\ndare to advance a sentence, without supporting it by the authority of\r\nthe judge from whence it was borrowed.\r\n\r\nBut in process of time, and in ages of ignorance, the clerk began to\r\ninvade the power and assume the dignity of his master. The laws of\r\nwriting were no longer founded on the practice of the author, but on\r\nthe dictates of the critic. The clerk became the legislator, and those\r\nvery peremptorily gave laws whose business it was, at first, only to\r\ntranscribe them.\r\n\r\nHence arose an obvious, and perhaps an unavoidable error; for these\r\ncritics being men of shallow capacities, very easily mistook mere form\r\nfor substance. They acted as a judge would, who should adhere to the\r\nlifeless letter of law, and reject the spirit. Little circumstances,\r\nwhich were perhaps accidental in a great author, were by these critics\r\nconsidered to constitute his chief merit, and transmitted as\r\nessentials to be observed by all his successors. To these\r\nencroachments, time and ignorance, the two great supporters of\r\nimposture, gave authority; and thus many rules for good writing have\r\nbeen established, which have not the least foundation in truth or\r\nnature; and which commonly serve for no other purpose than to curb and\r\nrestrain genius, in the same manner as it would have restrained the\r\ndancing-master, had the many excellent treatises on that art laid it\r\ndown as an essential rule that every man must dance in chains.\r\n\r\nTo avoid, therefore, all imputation of laying down a rule for\r\nposterity, founded only on the authority of _ipse dixit_--for which,\r\nto say the truth, we have not the profoundest veneration--we shall\r\nhere waive the privilege above contended for, and proceed to lay\r\nbefore the reader the reasons which have induced us to intersperse\r\nthese several digressive essays in the course of this work.\r\n\r\nAnd here we shall of necessity be led to open a new vein of knowledge,\r\nwhich if it hath been discovered, hath not, to our remembrance, been\r\nwrought on by any antient or modern writer. This vein is no other than\r\nthat of contrast, which runs through all the works of the creation,\r\nand may probably have a large share in constituting in us the idea of\r\nall beauty, as well natural as artificial: for what demonstrates the\r\nbeauty and excellence of anything but its reverse? Thus the beauty of\r\nday, and that of summer, is set off by the horrors of night and\r\nwinter. And, I believe, if it was possible for a man to have seen only\r\nthe two former, he would have a very imperfect idea of their beauty.\r\n\r\nBut to avoid too serious an air; can it be doubted, but that the\r\nfinest woman in the world would lose all benefit of her charms in the\r\neye of a man who had never seen one of another cast? The ladies\r\nthemselves seem so sensible of this, that they are all industrious to\r\nprocure foils: nay, they will become foils to themselves; for I have\r\nobserved (at Bath particularly) that they endeavour to appear as ugly\r\nas possible in the morning, in order to set off that beauty which they\r\nintend to show you in the evening.\r\n\r\nMost artists have this secret in practice, though some, perhaps, have\r\nnot much studied the theory. The jeweller knows that the finest\r\nbrilliant requires a foil; and the painter, by the contrast of his\r\nfigures, often acquires great applause.\r\n\r\nA great genius among us will illustrate this matter fully. I cannot,\r\nindeed, range him under any general head of common artists, as he hath\r\na title to be placed among those\r\n\r\n _Inventas qui vitam excoluere per artes._\r\n Who by invented arts have life improved.\r\n\r\nI mean here the inventor of that most exquisite entertainment, called\r\nthe English Pantomime.\r\n\r\nThis entertainment consisted of two parts, which the inventor\r\ndistinguished by the names of the serious and the comic. The serious\r\nexhibited a certain number of heathen gods and heroes, who were\r\ncertainly the worst and dullest company into which an audience was\r\never introduced; and (which was a secret known to few) were actually\r\nintended so to be, in order to contrast the comic part of the\r\nentertainment, and to display the tricks of harlequin to the better\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nThis was, perhaps, no very civil use of such personages: but the\r\ncontrivance was, nevertheless, ingenious enough, and had its effect.\r\nAnd this will now plainly appear, if, instead of serious and comic, we\r\nsupply the words duller and dullest; for the comic was certainly\r\nduller than anything before shown on the stage, and could be set off\r\nonly by that superlative degree of dulness which composed the serious.\r\nSo intolerably serious, indeed, were these gods and heroes, that\r\nharlequin (though the English gentleman of that name is not at all\r\nrelated to the French family, for he is of a much more serious\r\ndisposition) was always welcome on the stage, as he relieved the\r\naudience from worse company.\r\n\r\nJudicious writers have always practised this art of contrast with\r\ngreat success. I have been surprized that Horace should cavil at this\r\nart in Homer; but indeed he contradicts himself in the very next line:\r\n\r\n _Indignor quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus;\r\n Verum opere in longo fas est obrepere somnum._\r\n\r\n I grieve if e'er great Homer chance to sleep,\r\n Yet slumbers on long works have right to creep.\r\n\r\nFor we are not here to understand, as perhaps some have, that an\r\nauthor actually falls asleep while he is writing. It is true, that\r\nreaders are too apt to be so overtaken; but if the work was as long as\r\nany of Oldmixon, the author himself is too well entertained to be\r\nsubject to the least drowsiness. He is, as Mr Pope observes,\r\n\r\n Sleepless himself to give his readers sleep.\r\n\r\nTo say the truth, these soporific parts are so many scenes of serious\r\nartfully interwoven, in order to contrast and set off the rest; and\r\nthis is the true meaning of a late facetious writer, who told the\r\npublic that whenever he was dull they might be assured there was a\r\ndesign in it.\r\n\r\nIn this light, then, or rather in this darkness, I would have the\r\nreader to consider these initial essays. And after this warning, if he\r\nshall be of opinion that he can find enough of serious in other parts\r\nof this history, he may pass over these, in which we profess to be\r\nlaboriously dull, and begin the following books at the second chapter."

      "content": "In which Mr Jones receives many friendly visits during his\r\nconfinement; with some fine touches of the passion of love, scarce\r\nvisible to the naked eye.\r\n\nTom Jones had many visitors during his confinement, though some,\r\nperhaps, were not very agreeable to him. Mr Allworthy saw him almost\r\nevery day; but though he pitied Tom's sufferings, and greatly approved\r\nthe gallant behaviour which had occasioned them; yet he thought this\r\nwas a favourable opportunity to bring him to a sober sense of his\r\nindiscreet conduct; and that wholesome advice for that purpose could\r\nnever be applied at a more proper season than at the present, when the\r\nmind was softened by pain and sickness, and alarmed by danger; and\r\nwhen its attention was unembarrassed with those turbulent passions\r\nwhich engage us in the pursuit of pleasure.\r\n\r\nAt all seasons, therefore, when the good man was alone with the youth,\r\nespecially when the latter was totally at ease, he took occasion to\r\nremind him of his former miscarriages, but in the mildest and\r\ntenderest manner, and only in order to introduce the caution which he\r\nprescribed for his future behaviour; “on which alone,” he assured him,\r\n“would depend his own felicity, and the kindness which he might yet\r\npromise himself to receive at the hands of his father by adoption,\r\nunless he should hereafter forfeit his good opinion: for as to what\r\nhad past,” he said, “it should be all forgiven and forgotten. He\r\ntherefore advised him to make a good use of this accident, that so in\r\nthe end it might prove a visitation for his own good.”\r\n\r\nThwackum was likewise pretty assiduous in his visits; and he too\r\nconsidered a sick-bed to be a convenient scene for lectures. His\r\nstile, however, was more severe than Mr Allworthy's: he told his\r\npupil, “That he ought to look on his broken limb as a judgment from\r\nheaven on his sins. That it would become him to be daily on his knees,\r\npouring forth thanksgivings that he had broken his arm only, and not\r\nhis neck; which latter,” he said, “was very probably reserved for some\r\nfuture occasion, and that, perhaps, not very remote. For his part,” he\r\nsaid, “he had often wondered some judgment had not overtaken him\r\nbefore; but it might be perceived by this, that Divine punishments,\r\nthough slow, are always sure.” Hence likewise he advised him, “to\r\nforesee, with equal certainty, the greater evils which were yet\r\nbehind, and which were as sure as this of overtaking him in his state\r\nof reprobacy. These are,” said he, “to be averted only by such a\r\nthorough and sincere repentance as is not to be expected or hoped for\r\nfrom one so abandoned in his youth, and whose mind, I am afraid, is\r\ntotally corrupted. It is my duty, however, to exhort you to this\r\nrepentance, though I too well know all exhortations will be vain and\r\nfruitless. But _liberavi animam meam._ I can accuse my own conscience\r\nof no neglect; though it is at the same time with the utmost concern I\r\nsee you travelling on to certain misery in this world, and to as\r\ncertain damnation in the next.”\r\n\r\nSquare talked in a very different strain; he said, “Such accidents as\r\na broken bone were below the consideration of a wise man. That it was\r\nabundantly sufficient to reconcile the mind to any of these\r\nmischances, to reflect that they are liable to befal the wisest of\r\nmankind, and are undoubtedly for the good of the whole.” He said, “It\r\nwas a mere abuse of words to call those things evils, in which there\r\nwas no moral unfitness: that pain, which was the worst consequence of\r\nsuch accidents, was the most contemptible thing in the world;” with\r\nmore of the like sentences, extracted out of the second book of\r\nTully's Tusculan questions, and from the great Lord Shaftesbury. In\r\npronouncing these he was one day so eager, that he unfortunately bit\r\nhis tongue; and in such a manner, that it not only put an end to his\r\ndiscourse, but created much emotion in him, and caused him to mutter\r\nan oath or two: but what was worst of all, this accident gave\r\nThwackum, who was present, and who held all such doctrine to be\r\nheathenish and atheistical, an opportunity to clap a judgment on his\r\nback. Now this was done with so malicious a sneer, that it totally\r\nunhinged (if I may so say) the temper of the philosopher, which the\r\nbite of his tongue had somewhat ruffled; and as he was disabled from\r\nventing his wrath at his lips, he had possibly found a more violent\r\nmethod of revenging himself, had not the surgeon, who was then luckily\r\nin the room, contrary to his own interest, interposed and preserved\r\nthe peace.\r\n\r\nMr Blifil visited his friend Jones but seldom, and never alone. This\r\nworthy young man, however, professed much regard for him, and as great\r\nconcern at his misfortune; but cautiously avoided any intimacy, lest,\r\nas he frequently hinted, it might contaminate the sobriety of his own\r\ncharacter: for which purpose he had constantly in his mouth that\r\nproverb in which Solomon speaks against evil communication. Not that\r\nhe was so bitter as Thwackum; for he always expressed some hopes of\r\nTom's reformation; “which,” he said, “the unparalleled goodness shown\r\nby his uncle on this occasion, must certainly effect in one not\r\nabsolutely abandoned:” but concluded, “if Mr Jones ever offends\r\nhereafter, I shall not be able to say a syllable in his favour.”\r\n\r\nAs to Squire Western, he was seldom out of the sick-room, unless when\r\nhe was engaged either in the field or over his bottle. Nay, he would\r\nsometimes retire hither to take his beer, and it was not without\r\ndifficulty that he was prevented from forcing Jones to take his beer\r\ntoo: for no quack ever held his nostrum to be a more general panacea\r\nthan he did this; which, he said, had more virtue in it than was in\r\nall the physic in an apothecary's shop. He was, however, by much\r\nentreaty, prevailed on to forbear the application of this medicine;\r\nbut from serenading his patient every hunting morning with the horn\r\nunder his window, it was impossible to withhold him; nor did he ever\r\nlay aside that hallow, with which he entered into all companies, when\r\nhe visited Jones, without any regard to the sick person's being at\r\nthat time either awake or asleep.\r\n\r\nThis boisterous behaviour, as it meant no harm, so happily it effected\r\nnone, and was abundantly compensated to Jones, as soon as he was able\r\nto sit up, by the company of Sophia, whom the squire then brought to\r\nvisit him; nor was it, indeed, long before Jones was able to attend\r\nher to the harpsichord, where she would kindly condescend, for hours\r\ntogether, to charm him with the most delicious music, unless when the\r\nsquire thought proper to interrupt her, by insisting on Old Sir Simon,\r\nor some other of his favourite pieces.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the nicest guard which Sophia endeavoured to set on\r\nher behaviour, she could not avoid letting some appearances now and\r\nthen slip forth: for love may again be likened to a disease in this,\r\nthat when it is denied a vent in one part, it will certainly break out\r\nin another. What her lips, therefore, concealed, her eyes, her\r\nblushes, and many little involuntary actions, betrayed.\r\n\r\nOne day, when Sophia was playing on the harpsichord, and Jones was\r\nattending, the squire came into the room, crying, “There, Tom, I have\r\nhad a battle for thee below-stairs with thick parson Thwackum. He hath\r\nbeen a telling Allworthy, before my face, that the broken bone was a\r\njudgment upon thee. D--n it, says I, how can that be? Did he not come\r\nby it in defence of a young woman? A judgment indeed! Pox, if he never\r\ndoth anything worse, he will go to heaven sooner than all the parsons\r\nin the country. He hath more reason to glory in it than to be ashamed\r\nof it.”--“Indeed, sir,” says Jones, “I have no reason for either; but\r\nif it preserved Miss Western, I shall always think it the happiest\r\naccident of my life.”--“And to gu,” said the squire, “to zet Allworthy\r\nagainst thee vor it! D--n un, if the parson had unt his petticuoats\r\non, I should have lent un o flick; for I love thee dearly, my boy, and\r\nd--n me if there is anything in my power which I won't do for thee.\r\nSha't take thy choice of all the horses in my stable to-morrow\r\nmorning, except only the Chevalier and Miss Slouch.” Jones thanked\r\nhim, but declined accepting the offer. “Nay,” added the squire, “sha't\r\nha the sorrel mare that Sophy rode. She cost me fifty guineas, and\r\ncomes six years old this grass.” “If she had cost me a thousand,”\r\n cries Jones passionately, “I would have given her to the dogs.” “Pooh!\r\npooh!” answered Western; “what! because she broke thy arm? Shouldst\r\nforget and forgive. I thought hadst been more a man than to bear\r\nmalice against a dumb creature.”--Here Sophia interposed, and put an\r\nend to the conversation, by desiring her father's leave to play to\r\nhim; a request which he never refused.\r\n\r\nThe countenance of Sophia had undergone more than one change during\r\nthe foregoing speeches; and probably she imputed the passionate\r\nresentment which Jones had expressed against the mare, to a different\r\nmotive from that from which her father had derived it. Her spirits\r\nwere at this time in a visible flutter; and she played so intolerably\r\nill, that had not Western soon fallen asleep, he must have remarked\r\nit. Jones, however, who was sufficiently awake, and was not without an\r\near any more than without eyes, made some observations; which being\r\njoined to all which the reader may remember to have passed formerly,\r\ngave him pretty strong assurances, when he came to reflect on the\r\nwhole, that all was not well in the tender bosom of Sophia; an opinion\r\nwhich many young gentlemen will, I doubt not, extremely wonder at his\r\nnot having been well confirmed in long ago. To confess the truth, he\r\nhad rather too much diffidence in himself, and was not forward enough\r\nin seeing the advances of a young lady; a misfortune which can be\r\ncured only by that early town education, which is at present so\r\ngenerally in fashion.\r\n\r\nWhen these thoughts had fully taken possession of Jones, they\r\noccasioned a perturbation in his mind, which, in a constitution less\r\npure and firm than his, might have been, at such a season, attended\r\nwith very dangerous consequences. He was truly sensible of the great\r\nworth of Sophia. He extremely liked her person, no less admired her\r\naccomplishments, and tenderly loved her goodness. In reality, as he\r\nhad never once entertained any thought of possessing her, nor had ever\r\ngiven the least voluntary indulgence to his inclinations, he had a\r\nmuch stronger passion for her than he himself was acquainted with. His\r\nheart now brought forth the full secret, at the same time that it\r\nassured him the adorable object returned his affection."

      "content": "Which all who have no heart will think to contain much ado about\r\nnothing.\r\n\nThe reader will perhaps imagine the sensations which now arose in\r\nJones to have been so sweet and delicious, that they would rather tend\r\nto produce a chearful serenity in the mind, than any of those\r\ndangerous effects which we have mentioned; but in fact, sensations of\r\nthis kind, however delicious, are, at their first recognition, of a\r\nvery tumultuous nature, and have very little of the opiate in them.\r\nThey were, moreover, in the present case, embittered with certain\r\ncircumstances, which being mixed with sweeter ingredients, tended\r\naltogether to compose a draught that might be termed bitter-sweet;\r\nthan which, as nothing can be more disagreeable to the palate, so\r\nnothing, in the metaphorical sense, can be so injurious to the mind.\r\n\r\nFor first, though he had sufficient foundation to flatter himself in\r\nwhat he had observed in Sophia, he was not yet free from doubt of\r\nmisconstruing compassion, or at best, esteem, into a warmer regard. He\r\nwas far from a sanguine assurance that Sophia had any such affection\r\ntowards him, as might promise his inclinations that harvest, which, if\r\nthey were encouraged and nursed, they would finally grow up to\r\nrequire. Besides, if he could hope to find no bar to his happiness\r\nfrom the daughter, he thought himself certain of meeting an effectual\r\nbar in the father; who, though he was a country squire in his\r\ndiversions, was perfectly a man of the world in whatever regarded his\r\nfortune; had the most violent affection for his only daughter, and had\r\noften signified, in his cups, the pleasure he proposed in seeing her\r\nmarried to one of the richest men in the county. Jones was not so vain\r\nand senseless a coxcomb as to expect, from any regard which Western\r\nhad professed for him, that he would ever be induced to lay aside\r\nthese views of advancing his daughter. He well knew that fortune is\r\ngenerally the principal, if not the sole, consideration, which\r\noperates on the best of parents in these matters: for friendship makes\r\nus warmly espouse the interest of others; but it is very cold to the\r\ngratification of their passions. Indeed, to feel the happiness which\r\nmay result from this, it is necessary we should possess the passion\r\nourselves. As he had therefore no hopes of obtaining her father's\r\nconsent; so he thought to endeavour to succeed without it, and by such\r\nmeans to frustrate the great point of Mr Western's life, was to make a\r\nvery ill use of his hospitality, and a very ungrateful return to the\r\nmany little favours received (however roughly) at his hands. If he saw\r\nsuch a consequence with horror and disdain, how much more was he\r\nshocked with what regarded Mr Allworthy; to whom, as he had more than\r\nfilial obligations, so had he for him more than filial piety! He knew\r\nthe nature of that good man to be so averse to any baseness or\r\ntreachery, that the least attempt of such a kind would make the sight\r\nof the guilty person for ever odious to his eyes, and his name a\r\ndetestable sound in his ears. The appearance of such unsurmountable\r\ndifficulties was sufficient to have inspired him with despair, however\r\nardent his wishes had been; but even these were contruoled by\r\ncompassion for another woman. The idea of lovely Molly now intruded\r\nitself before him. He had sworn eternal constancy in her arms, and she\r\nhad as often vowed never to out-live his deserting her. He now saw her\r\nin all the most shocking postures of death; nay, he considered all the\r\nmiseries of prostitution to which she would be liable, and of which he\r\nwould be doubly the occasion; first by seducing, and then by deserting\r\nher; for he well knew the hatred which all her neighbours, and even\r\nher own sisters, bore her, and how ready they would all be to tear her\r\nto pieces. Indeed, he had exposed her to more envy than shame, or\r\nrather to the latter by means of the former: for many women abused her\r\nfor being a whore, while they envied her her lover, and her finery,\r\nand would have been themselves glad to have purchased these at the\r\nsame rate. The ruin, therefore, of the poor girl must, he foresaw,\r\nunavoidably attend his deserting her; and this thought stung him to\r\nthe soul. Poverty and distress seemed to him to give none a right of\r\naggravating those misfortunes. The meanness of her condition did not\r\nrepresent her misery as of little consequence in his eyes, nor did it\r\nappear to justify, or even to palliate, his guilt, in bringing that\r\nmisery upon her. But why do I mention justification? His own heart\r\nwould not suffer him to destroy a human creature who, he thought,\r\nloved him, and had to that love sacrificed her innocence. His own good\r\nheart pleaded her cause; not as a cold venal advocate, but as one\r\ninterested in the event, and which must itself deeply share in all the\r\nagonies its owner brought on another.\r\n\r\nWhen this powerful advocate had sufficiently raised the pity of Jones,\r\nby painting poor Molly in all the circumstances of wretchedness; it\r\nartfully called in the assistance of another passion, and represented\r\nthe girl in all the amiable colours of youth, health, and beauty; as\r\none greatly the object of desire, and much more so, at least to a good\r\nmind, from being, at the same time, the object of compassion.\r\n\r\nAmidst these thoughts, poor Jones passed a long sleepless night, and\r\nin the morning the result of the whole was to abide by Molly, and to\r\nthink no more of Sophia.\r\n\r\nIn this virtuous resolution he continued all the next day till the\r\nevening, cherishing the idea of Molly, and driving Sophia from his\r\nthoughts; but in the fatal evening, a very trifling accident set all\r\nhis passions again on float, and worked so total a change in his mind,\r\nthat we think it decent to communicate it in a fresh chapter."

      "content": "A little chapter, in which is contained a little incident.\r\n\nAmong other visitants, who paid their compliments to the young\r\ngentleman in his confinement, Mrs Honour was one. The reader, perhaps,\r\nwhen he reflects on some expressions which have formerly dropt from\r\nher, may conceive that she herself had a very particular affection for\r\nMr Jones; but, in reality, it was no such thing. Tom was a handsome\r\nyoung fellow; and for that species of men Mrs Honour had some regard;\r\nbut this was perfectly indiscriminate; for having being crossed in the\r\nlove which she bore a certain nobleman's footman, who had basely\r\ndeserted her after a promise of marriage, she had so securely kept\r\ntogether the broken remains of her heart, that no man had ever since\r\nbeen able to possess himself of any single fragment. She viewed all\r\nhandsome men with that equal regard and benevolence which a sober and\r\nvirtuous mind bears to all the good. She might indeed be called a\r\nlover of men, as Socrates was a lover of mankind, preferring one to\r\nanother for corporeal, as he for mental qualifications; but never\r\ncarrying this preference so far as to cause any perturbation in the\r\nphilosophical serenity of her temper.\r\n\r\nThe day after Mr Jones had that conflict with himself which we have\r\nseen in the preceding chapter, Mrs Honour came into his room, and\r\nfinding him alone, began in the following manner:--“La, sir, where do\r\nyou think I have been? I warrants you, you would not guess in fifty\r\nyears; but if you did guess, to be sure I must not tell you\r\nneither.”--“Nay, if it be something which you must not tell me,” said\r\nJones, “I shall have the curiosity to enquire, and I know you will not\r\nbe so barbarous to refuse me.”--“I don't know,” cries she, “why I\r\nshould refuse you neither, for that matter; for to be sure you won't\r\nmention it any more. And for that matter, if you knew where I have\r\nbeen, unless you knew what I have been about, it would not signify\r\nmuch. Nay, I don't see why it should be kept a secret for my part; for\r\nto be sure she is the best lady in the world.” Upon this, Jones began\r\nto beg earnestly to be let into this secret, and faithfully promised\r\nnot to divulge it. She then proceeded thus:--“Why, you must know, sir,\r\nmy young lady sent me to enquire after Molly Seagrim, and to see\r\nwhether the wench wanted anything; to be sure, I did not care to go,\r\nmethinks; but servants must do what they are ordered.--How could you\r\nundervalue yourself so, Mr Jones?--So my lady bid me go and carry her\r\nsome linen, and other things. She is too good. If such forward sluts\r\nwere sent to Bridewell, it would be better for them. I told my lady,\r\nsays I, madam, your la'ship is encouraging idleness.”--“And was my\r\nSophia so good?” says Jones. “My Sophia! I assure you, marry come up,”\r\n answered Honour. “And yet if you knew all--indeed, if I was as Mr\r\nJones, I should look a little higher than such trumpery as Molly\r\nSeagrim.” “What do you mean by these words,” replied Jones, “if I knew\r\nall?” “I mean what I mean,” says Honour. “Don't you remember putting\r\nyour hands in my lady's muff once? I vow I could almost find in my\r\nheart to tell, if I was certain my lady would never come to the\r\nhearing on't.” Jones then made several solemn protestations. And\r\nHonour proceeded--“Then to be sure, my lady gave me that muff; and\r\nafterwards, upon hearing what you had done”--“Then you told her what I\r\nhad done?” interrupted Jones. “If I did, sir,” answered she, “you need\r\nnot be angry with me. Many's the man would have given his head to have\r\nhad my lady told, if they had known,--for, to be sure, the biggest\r\nlord in the land might be proud--but, I protest, I have a great mind\r\nnot to tell you.” Jones fell to entreaties, and soon prevailed on her\r\nto go on thus. “You must know then, sir, that my lady had given this\r\nmuff to me; but about a day or two after I had told her the story, she\r\nquarrels with her new muff, and to be sure it is the prettiest that\r\never was seen. Honour, says she, this is an odious muff; it is too big\r\nfor me, I can't wear it: till I can get another, you must let me have\r\nmy old one again, and you may have this in the room on't--for she's a\r\ngood lady, and scorns to give a thing and take a thing, I promise you\r\nthat. So to be sure I fetched it her back again, and, I believe, she\r\nhath worn it upon her arm almost ever since, and I warrants hath given\r\nit many a kiss when nobody hath seen her.”\r\n\r\nHere the conversation was interrupted by Mr Western himself, who came\r\nto summon Jones to the harpsichord; whither the poor young fellow went\r\nall pale and trembling. This Western observed, but, on seeing Mrs\r\nHonour, imputed it to a wrong cause; and having given Jones a hearty\r\ncurse between jest and earnest, he bid him beat abroad, and not poach\r\nup the game in his warren.\r\n\r\nSophia looked this evening with more than usual beauty, and we may\r\nbelieve it was no small addition to her charms, in the eye of Mr\r\nJones, that she now happened to have on her right arm this very muff.\r\n\r\nShe was playing one of her father's favourite tunes, and he was\r\nleaning on her chair, when the muff fell over her fingers, and put her\r\nout. This so disconcerted the squire, that he snatched the muff from\r\nher, and with a hearty curse threw it into the fire. Sophia instantly\r\nstarted up, and with the utmost eagerness recovered it from the\r\nflames.\r\n\r\nThough this incident will probably appear of little consequence to\r\nmany of our readers; yet, trifling as it was, it had so violent an\r\neffect on poor Jones, that we thought it our duty to relate it. In\r\nreality, there are many little circumstances too often omitted by\r\ninjudicious historians, from which events of the utmost importance\r\narise. The world may indeed be considered as a vast machine, in which\r\nthe great wheels are originally set in motion by those which are very\r\nminute, and almost imperceptible to any but the strongest eyes.\r\n\r\nThus, not all the charms of the incomparable Sophia; not all the\r\ndazzling brightness, and languishing softness of her eyes; the harmony\r\nof her voice, and of her person; not all her wit, good-humour,\r\ngreatness of mind, or sweetness of disposition, had been able so\r\nabsolutely to conquer and enslave the heart of poor Jones, as this\r\nlittle incident of the muff. Thus the poet sweetly sings of Troy--\r\n\r\n _--Captique dolis lachrymisque coacti\r\n Quos neque Tydides, nec Larissaeus Achilles,\r\n Non anni domuere decem, non mille Carinae._\r\n\r\n What Diomede or Thetis' greater son,\r\n A thousand ships, nor ten years' siege had done\r\n False tears and fawning words the city won.\r\n\r\nThe citadel of Jones was now taken by surprize. All those\r\nconsiderations of honour and prudence which our heroe had lately with\r\nso much military wisdom placed as guards over the avenues of his\r\nheart, ran away from their posts, and the god of love marched in, in\r\ntriumph."

      "content": "A very long chapter, containing a very great incident.\r\n\nBut though this victorious deity easily expelled his avowed enemies\r\nfrom the heart of Jones, he found it more difficult to supplant the\r\ngarrison which he himself had placed there. To lay aside all allegory,\r\nthe concern for what must become of poor Molly greatly disturbed and\r\nperplexed the mind of the worthy youth. The superior merit of Sophia\r\ntotally eclipsed, or rather extinguished, all the beauties of the poor\r\ngirl; but compassion instead of contempt succeeded to love. He was\r\nconvinced the girl had placed all her affections, and all her prospect\r\nof future happiness, in him only. For this he had, he knew, given\r\nsufficient occasion, by the utmost profusion of tenderness towards\r\nher: a tenderness which he had taken every means to persuade her he\r\nwould always maintain. She, on her side, had assured him of her firm\r\nbelief in his promise, and had with the most solemn vows declared,\r\nthat on his fulfilling or breaking these promises, it depended,\r\nwhether she should be the happiest or most miserable of womankind. And\r\nto be the author of this highest degree of misery to a human being,\r\nwas a thought on which he could not bear to ruminate a single moment.\r\nHe considered this poor girl as having sacrificed to him everything in\r\nher little power; as having been at her own expense the object of his\r\npleasure; as sighing and languishing for him even at that very\r\ninstant. Shall then, says he, my recovery, for which she hath so\r\nardently wished; shall my presence, which she hath so eagerly\r\nexpected, instead of giving her that joy with which she hath flattered\r\nherself, cast her at once down into misery and despair? Can I be such\r\na villain? Here, when the genius of poor Molly seemed triumphant, the\r\nlove of Sophia towards him, which now appeared no longer dubious,\r\nrushed upon his mind, and bore away every obstacle before it.\r\n\r\nAt length it occurred to him, that he might possibly be able to make\r\nMolly amends another way; namely, by giving her a sum of money. This,\r\nnevertheless, he almost despaired of her accepting, when he\r\nrecollected the frequent and vehement assurances he had received from\r\nher, that the world put in balance with him would make her no amends\r\nfor his loss. However, her extreme poverty, and chiefly her egregious\r\nvanity (somewhat of which hath been already hinted to the reader),\r\ngave him some little hope, that, notwithstanding all her avowed\r\ntenderness, she might in time be brought to content herself with a\r\nfortune superior to her expectation, and which might indulge her\r\nvanity, by setting her above all her equals. He resolved therefore to\r\ntake the first opportunity of making a proposal of this kind.\r\n\r\nOne day, accordingly, when his arm was so well recovered that he could\r\nwalk easily with it slung in a sash, he stole forth, at a season when\r\nthe squire was engaged in his field exercises, and visited his fair\r\none. Her mother and sisters, whom he found taking their tea, informed\r\nhim first that Molly was not at home; but afterwards the eldest sister\r\nacquainted him, with a malicious smile, that she was above stairs\r\na-bed. Tom had no objection to this situation of his mistress, and\r\nimmediately ascended the ladder which led towards her bed-chamber; but\r\nwhen he came to the top, he, to his great surprize, found the door\r\nfast; nor could he for some time obtain any answer from within; for\r\nMolly, as she herself afterwards informed him, was fast asleep.\r\n\r\nThe extremes of grief and joy have been remarked to produce very\r\nsimilar effects; and when either of these rushes on us by surprize, it\r\nis apt to create such a total perturbation and confusion, that we are\r\noften thereby deprived of the use of all our faculties. It cannot\r\ntherefore be wondered at, that the unexpected sight of Mr Jones should\r\nso strongly operate on the mind of Molly, and should overwhelm her\r\nwith such confusion, that for some minutes she was unable to express\r\nthe great raptures, with which the reader will suppose she was\r\naffected on this occasion. As for Jones, he was so entirely possessed,\r\nand as it were enchanted, by the presence of his beloved object, that\r\nhe for a while forgot Sophia, and consequently the principal purpose\r\nof his visit.\r\n\r\nThis, however, soon recurred to his memory; and after the first\r\ntransports of their meeting were over, he found means by degrees to\r\nintroduce a discourse on the fatal consequences which must attend\r\ntheir amour, if Mr Allworthy, who had strictly forbidden him ever\r\nseeing her more, should discover that he still carried on this\r\ncommerce. Such a discovery, which his enemies gave him reason to think\r\nwould be unavoidable, must, he said, end in his ruin, and consequently\r\nin hers. Since therefore their hard fates had determined that they\r\nmust separate, he advised her to bear it with resolution, and swore he\r\nwould never omit any opportunity, through the course of his life, of\r\nshowing her the sincerity of his affection, by providing for her in a\r\nmanner beyond her utmost expectation, or even beyond her wishes, if\r\never that should be in his power; concluding at last, that she might\r\nsoon find some man who would marry her, and who would make her much\r\nhappier than she could be by leading a disreputable life with him.\r\n\r\nMolly remained a few moments in silence, and then bursting into a\r\nflood of tears, she began to upbraid him in the following words: “And\r\nthis is your love for me, to forsake me in this manner, now you have\r\nruined me! How often, when I have told you that all men are false and\r\nperjury alike, and grow tired of us as soon as ever they have had\r\ntheir wicked wills of us, how often have you sworn you would never\r\nforsake me! And can you be such a perjury man after all? What\r\nsignifies all the riches in the world to me without you, now you have\r\ngained my heart, so you have--you have--? Why do you mention another\r\nman to me? I can never love any other man as long as I live. All other\r\nmen are nothing to me. If the greatest squire in all the country would\r\ncome a suiting to me to-morrow, I would not give my company to him.\r\nNo, I shall always hate and despise the whole sex for your sake.”--\r\n\r\nShe was proceeding thus, when an accident put a stop to her tongue,\r\nbefore it had run out half its career. The room, or rather garret, in\r\nwhich Molly lay, being up one pair of stairs, that is to say, at the\r\ntop of the house, was of a sloping figure, resembling the great Delta\r\nof the Greeks. The English reader may perhaps form a better idea of\r\nit, by being told that it was impossible to stand upright anywhere but\r\nin the middle. Now, as this room wanted the conveniency of a closet,\r\nMolly had, to supply that defect, nailed up an old rug against the\r\nrafters of the house, which enclosed a little hole where her best\r\napparel, such as the remains of that sack which we have formerly\r\nmentioned, some caps, and other things with which she had lately\r\nprovided herself, were hung up and secured from the dust.\r\n\r\nThis enclosed place exactly fronted the foot of the bed, to which,\r\nindeed, the rug hung so near, that it served in a manner to supply the\r\nwant of curtains. Now, whether Molly, in the agonies of her rage,\r\npushed this rug with her feet; or Jones might touch it; or whether the\r\npin or nail gave way of its own accord, I am not certain; but as Molly\r\npronounced those last words, which are recorded above, the wicked rug\r\ngot loose from its fastening, and discovered everything hid behind it;\r\nwhere among other female utensils appeared--(with shame I write it,\r\nand with sorrow will it be read)--the philosopher Square, in a posture\r\n(for the place would not near admit his standing upright) as\r\nridiculous as can possibly be conceived.\r\n\r\nThe posture, indeed, in which he stood, was not greatly unlike that of\r\na soldier who is tied neck and heels; or rather resembling the\r\nattitude in which we often see fellows in the public streets of\r\nLondon, who are not suffering but deserving punishment by so standing.\r\nHe had a nightcap belonging to Molly on his head, and his two large\r\neyes, the moment the rug fell, stared directly at Jones; so that when\r\nthe idea of philosophy was added to the figure now discovered, it\r\nwould have been very difficult for any spectator to have refrained\r\nfrom immoderate laughter.\r\n\r\nI question not but the surprize of the reader will be here equal to\r\nthat of Jones; as the suspicions which must arise from the appearance\r\nof this wise and grave man in such a place, may seem so inconsistent\r\nwith that character which he hath, doubtless, maintained hitherto, in\r\nthe opinion of every one.\r\n\r\nBut to confess the truth, this inconsistency is rather imaginary than\r\nreal. Philosophers are composed of flesh and blood as well as other\r\nhuman creatures; and however sublimated and refined the theory of\r\nthese may be, a little practical frailty is as incident to them as to\r\nother mortals. It is, indeed, in theory only, and not in practice, as\r\nwe have before hinted, that consists the difference: for though such\r\ngreat beings think much better and more wisely, they always act\r\nexactly like other men. They know very well how to subdue all\r\nappetites and passions, and to despise both pain and pleasure; and\r\nthis knowledge affords much delightful contemplation, and is easily\r\nacquired; but the practice would be vexatious and troublesome; and,\r\ntherefore, the same wisdom which teaches them to know this, teaches\r\nthem to avoid carrying it into execution.\r\n\r\nMr Square happened to be at church on that Sunday, when, as the reader\r\nmay be pleased to remember, the appearance of Molly in her sack had\r\ncaused all that disturbance. Here he first observed her, and was so\r\npleased with her beauty, that he prevailed with the young gentlemen to\r\nchange their intended ride that evening, that he might pass by the\r\nhabitation of Molly, and by that means might obtain a second chance of\r\nseeing her. This reason, however, as he did not at that time mention\r\nto any, so neither did we think proper to communicate it then to the\r\nreader.\r\n\r\nAmong other particulars which constituted the unfitness of things in\r\nMr Square's opinion, danger and difficulty were two. The difficulty\r\ntherefore which he apprehended there might be in corrupting this young\r\nwench, and the danger which would accrue to his character on the\r\ndiscovery, were such strong dissuasives, that it is probable he at\r\nfirst intended to have contented himself with the pleasing ideas which\r\nthe sight of beauty furnishes us with. These the gravest men, after a\r\nfull meal of serious meditation, often allow themselves by way of\r\ndessert: for which purpose, certain books and pictures find their way\r\ninto the most private recesses of their study, and a certain liquorish\r\npart of natural philosophy is often the principal subject of their\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nBut when the philosopher heard, a day or two afterwards, that the\r\nfortress of virtue had already been subdued, he began to give a larger\r\nscope to his desires. His appetite was not of that squeamish kind\r\nwhich cannot feed on a dainty because another hath tasted it. In\r\nshort, he liked the girl the better for the want of that chastity,\r\nwhich, if she had possessed it, must have been a bar to his pleasures;\r\nhe pursued and obtained her.\r\n\r\nThe reader will be mistaken, if he thinks Molly gave Square the\r\npreference to her younger lover: on the contrary, had she been\r\nconfined to the choice of one only, Tom Jones would undoubtedly have\r\nbeen, of the two, the victorious person. Nor was it solely the\r\nconsideration that two are better than one (though this had its proper\r\nweight) to which Mr Square owed his success: the absence of Jones\r\nduring his confinement was an unlucky circumstance; and in that\r\ninterval some well-chosen presents from the philosopher so softened\r\nand unguarded the girl's heart, that a favourable opportunity became\r\nirresistible, and Square triumphed over the poor remains of virtue\r\nwhich subsisted in the bosom of Molly.\r\n\r\nIt was now about a fortnight since this conquest, when Jones paid the\r\nabove-mentioned visit to his mistress, at a time when she and Square\r\nwere in bed together. This was the true reason why the mother denied\r\nher as we have seen; for as the old woman shared in the profits\r\narising from the iniquity of her daughter, she encouraged and\r\nprotected her in it to the utmost of her power; but such was the envy\r\nand hatred which the elder sister bore towards Molly, that,\r\nnotwithstanding she had some part of the booty, she would willingly\r\nhave parted with this to ruin her sister and spoil her trade. Hence\r\nshe had acquainted Jones with her being above-stairs in bed, in hopes\r\nthat he might have caught her in Square's arms. This, however, Molly\r\nfound means to prevent, as the door was fastened; which gave her an\r\nopportunity of conveying her lover behind that rug or blanket where he\r\nnow was unhappily discovered.\r\n\r\nSquare no sooner made his appearance than Molly flung herself back in\r\nher bed, cried out she was undone, and abandoned herself to despair.\r\nThis poor girl, who was yet but a novice in her business, had not\r\narrived to that perfection of assurance which helps off a town lady in\r\nany extremity; and either prompts her with an excuse, or else inspires\r\nher to brazen out the matter with her husband, who, from love of\r\nquiet, or out of fear of his reputation--and sometimes, perhaps, from\r\nfear of the gallant, who, like Mr Constant in the play, wears a\r\nsword--is glad to shut his eyes, and content to put his horns in his\r\npocket. Molly, on the contrary, was silenced by this evidence, and\r\nvery fairly gave up a cause which she had hitherto maintained with so\r\nmany tears, and with such solemn and vehement protestations of the\r\npurest love and constancy.\r\n\r\nAs to the gentleman behind the arras, he was not in much less\r\nconsternation. He stood for a while motionless, and seemed equally at\r\na loss what to say, or whither to direct his eyes. Jones, though\r\nperhaps the most astonished of the three, first found his tongue; and\r\nbeing immediately recovered from those uneasy sensations which Molly\r\nby her upbraidings had occasioned, he burst into a loud laughter, and\r\nthen saluting Mr Square, advanced to take him by the hand, and to\r\nrelieve him from his place of confinement.\r\n\r\nSquare being now arrived in the middle of the room, in which part only\r\nhe could stand upright, looked at Jones with a very grave countenance,\r\nand said to him, “Well, sir, I see you enjoy this mighty discovery,\r\nand, I dare swear, take great delight in the thoughts of exposing me;\r\nbut if you will consider the matter fairly, you will find you are\r\nyourself only to blame. I am not guilty of corrupting innocence. I\r\nhave done nothing for which that part of the world which judges of\r\nmatters by the rule of right, will condemn me. Fitness is governed by\r\nthe nature of things, and not by customs, forms, or municipal laws.\r\nNothing is indeed unfit which is not unnatural.”--“Well reasoned, old\r\nboy,” answered Jones; “but why dost thou think that I should desire to\r\nexpose thee? I promise thee, I was never better pleased with thee in\r\nmy life; and unless thou hast a mind to discover it thyself, this\r\naffair may remain a profound secret for me.”--“Nay, Mr Jones,” replied\r\nSquare, “I would not be thought to undervalue reputation. Good fame is\r\na species of the Kalon, and it is by no means fitting to neglect it.\r\nBesides, to murder one's own reputation is a kind of suicide, a\r\ndetestable and odious vice. If you think proper, therefore, to conceal\r\nany infirmity of mine (for such I may have, since no man is perfectly\r\nperfect), I promise you I will not betray myself. Things may be\r\nfitting to be done, which are not fitting to be boasted of; for\r\nby the perverse judgment of the world, that often becomes the\r\nsubject of censure, which is, in truth, not only innocent but\r\nlaudable.”--“Right!” cries Jones: “what can be more innocent than the\r\nindulgence of a natural appetite? or what more laudable than the\r\npropagation of our species?”--“To be serious with you,” answered\r\nSquare, “I profess they always appeared so to me.”--“And yet,” said\r\nJones, “you was of a different opinion when my affair with this girl\r\nwas first discovered.”--“Why, I must confess,” says Square, “as the\r\nmatter was misrepresented to me, by that parson Thwackum, I might\r\ncondemn the corruption of innocence: it was that, sir, it was\r\nthat--and that--: for you must know, Mr Jones, in the consideration of\r\nfitness, very minute circumstances, sir, very minute circumstances\r\ncause great alteration.”--“Well,” cries Jones, “be that as it will, it\r\nshall be your own fault, as I have promised you, if you ever hear any\r\nmore of this adventure. Behave kindly to the girl, and I will never\r\nopen my lips concerning the matter to any one. And, Molly, do you be\r\nfaithful to your friend, and I will not only forgive your infidelity\r\nto me, but will do you all the service I can.” So saying, he took a\r\nhasty leave, and, slipping down the ladder, retired with much\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nSquare was rejoiced to find this adventure was likely to have no worse\r\nconclusion; and as for Molly, being recovered from her confusion, she\r\nbegan at first to upbraid Square with having been the occasion of her\r\nloss of Jones; but that gentleman soon found the means of mitigating\r\nher anger, partly by caresses, and partly by a small nostrum from his\r\npurse, of wonderful and approved efficacy in purging off the ill\r\nhumours of the mind, and in restoring it to a good temper.\r\n\r\nShe then poured forth a vast profusion of tenderness towards her new\r\nlover; turned all she had said to Jones, and Jones himself, into\r\nridicule; and vowed, though he once had the possession of her person,\r\nthat none but Square had ever been master of her heart."

      "title": "Chapter vi.",
      "content": "By comparing which with the former, the reader may possibly correct\r\nsome abuse which he hath formerly been guilty of in the application of\r\nthe word love.\r\n\nThe infidelity of Molly, which Jones had now discovered, would,\r\nperhaps, have vindicated a much greater degree of resentment than he\r\nexpressed on the occasion; and if he had abandoned her directly from\r\nthat moment, very few, I believe, would have blamed him.\r\n\r\nCertain, however, it is, that he saw her in the light of compassion;\r\nand though his love to her was not of that kind which could give him\r\nany great uneasiness at her inconstancy, yet was he not a little\r\nshocked on reflecting that he had himself originally corrupted her\r\ninnocence; for to this corruption he imputed all the vice into which\r\nshe appeared now so likely to plunge herself.\r\n\r\nThis consideration gave him no little uneasiness, till Betty, the\r\nelder sister, was so kind, some time afterwards, entirely to cure him\r\nby a hint, that one Will Barnes, and not himself, had been the first\r\nseducer of Molly; and that the little child, which he had hitherto so\r\ncertainly concluded to be his own, might very probably have an equal\r\ntitle, at least, to claim Barnes for its father.\r\n\r\nJones eagerly pursued this scent when he had first received it; and in\r\na very short time was sufficiently assured that the girl had told him\r\ntruth, not only by the confession of the fellow, but at last by that\r\nof Molly herself.\r\n\r\nThis Will Barnes was a country gallant, and had acquired as many\r\ntrophies of this kind as any ensign or attorney's clerk in the\r\nkingdom. He had, indeed, reduced several women to a state of utter\r\nprofligacy, had broke the hearts of some, and had the honour of\r\noccasioning the violent death of one poor girl, who had either drowned\r\nherself, or, what was rather more probable, had been drowned by him.\r\n\r\nAmong other of his conquests, this fellow had triumphed over the heart\r\nof Betty Seagrim. He had made love to her long before Molly was grown\r\nto be a fit object of that pastime; but had afterwards deserted her,\r\nand applied to her sister, with whom he had almost immediate success.\r\nNow Will had, in reality, the sole possession of Molly's affection,\r\nwhile Jones and Square were almost equally sacrifices to her interest\r\nand to her pride.\r\n\r\nHence had grown that implacable hatred which we have before seen\r\nraging in the mind of Betty; though we did not think it necessary to\r\nassign this cause sooner, as envy itself alone was adequate to all the\r\neffects we have mentioned.\r\n\r\nJones was become perfectly easy by possession of this secret with\r\nregard to Molly; but as to Sophia, he was far from being in a state of\r\ntranquillity; nay, indeed, he was under the most violent perturbation;\r\nhis heart was now, if I may use the metaphor, entirely evacuated, and\r\nSophia took absolute possession of it. He loved her with an unbounded\r\npassion, and plainly saw the tender sentiments she had for him; yet\r\ncould not this assurance lessen his despair of obtaining the consent\r\nof her father, nor the horrors which attended his pursuit of her by\r\nany base or treacherous method.\r\n\r\nThe injury which he must thus do to Mr Western, and the concern which\r\nwould accrue to Mr Allworthy, were circumstances that tormented him\r\nall day, and haunted him on his pillow at night. His life was a\r\nconstant struggle between honour and inclination, which alternately\r\ntriumphed over each other in his mind. He often resolved, in the\r\nabsence of Sophia, to leave her father's house, and to see her no\r\nmore; and as often, in her presence, forgot all those resolutions, and\r\ndetermined to pursue her at the hazard of his life, and at the\r\nforfeiture of what was much dearer to him.\r\n\r\nThis conflict began soon to produce very strong and visible effects:\r\nfor he lost all his usual sprightliness and gaiety of temper, and\r\nbecame not only melancholy when alone, but dejected and absent in\r\ncompany; nay, if ever he put on a forced mirth, to comply with Mr\r\nWestern's humour, the constraint appeared so plain, that he seemed to\r\nhave been giving the strongest evidence of what he endeavoured to\r\nconceal by such ostentation.\r\n\r\nIt may, perhaps, be a question, whether the art which he used to\r\nconceal his passion, or the means which honest nature employed to\r\nreveal it, betrayed him most: for while art made him more than ever\r\nreserved to Sophia, and forbad him to address any of his discourse to\r\nher, nay, to avoid meeting her eyes, with the utmost caution; nature\r\nwas no less busy in counterplotting him. Hence, at the approach of the\r\nyoung lady, he grew pale; and if this was sudden, started. If his eyes\r\naccidentally met hers, the blood rushed into his cheeks, and his\r\ncountenance became all over scarlet. If common civility ever obliged\r\nhim to speak to her, as to drink her health at table, his tongue was\r\nsure to falter. If he touched her, his hand, nay his whole frame,\r\ntrembled. And if any discourse tended, however remotely, to raise the\r\nidea of love, an involuntary sigh seldom failed to steal from his\r\nbosom. Most of which accidents nature was wonderfully industrious to\r\nthrow daily in his way.\r\n\r\nAll these symptoms escaped the notice of the squire: but not so of\r\nSophia. She soon perceived these agitations of mind in Jones, and was\r\nat no loss to discover the cause; for indeed she recognized it in her\r\nown breast. And this recognition is, I suppose, that sympathy which\r\nhath been so often noted in lovers, and which will sufficiently\r\naccount for her being so much quicker-sighted than her father.\r\n\r\nBut, to say the truth, there is a more simple and plain method of\r\naccounting for that prodigious superiority of penetration which we\r\nmust observe in some men over the rest of the human species, and one\r\nwhich will serve not only in the case of lovers, but of all others.\r\nFrom whence is it that the knave is generally so quick-sighted to\r\nthose symptoms and operations of knavery, which often dupe an honest\r\nman of a much better understanding? There surely is no general\r\nsympathy among knaves; nor have they, like freemasons, any common sign\r\nof communication. In reality, it is only because they have the same\r\nthing in their heads, and their thoughts are turned the same way.\r\nThus, that Sophia saw, and that Western did not see, the plain\r\nsymptoms of love in Jones can be no wonder, when we consider that the\r\nidea of love never entered into the head of the father, whereas the\r\ndaughter, at present, thought of nothing else.\r\n\r\nWhen Sophia was well satisfied of the violent passion which tormented\r\npoor Jones, and no less certain that she herself was its object, she\r\nhad not the least difficulty in discovering the true cause of his\r\npresent behaviour. This highly endeared him to her, and raised in her\r\nmind two of the best affections which any lover can wish to raise in a\r\nmistress--these were, esteem and pity--for sure the most outrageously\r\nrigid among her sex will excuse her pitying a man whom she saw\r\nmiserable on her own account; nor can they blame her for esteeming one\r\nwho visibly, from the most honourable motives, endeavoured to smother\r\na flame in his own bosom, which, like the famous Spartan theft, was\r\npreying upon and consuming his very vitals. Thus his backwardness, his\r\nshunning her, his coldness, and his silence, were the forwardest, the\r\nmost diligent, the warmest, and most eloquent advocates; and wrought\r\nso violently on her sensible and tender heart, that she soon felt for\r\nhim all those gentle sensations which are consistent with a virtuous\r\nand elevated female mind. In short, all which esteem, gratitude, and\r\npity, can inspire in such towards an agreeable man--indeed, all which\r\nthe nicest delicacy can allow. In a word, she was in love with him to\r\ndistraction.\r\n\r\nOne day this young couple accidentally met in the garden, at the end\r\nof the two walks which were both bounded by that canal in which Jones\r\nhad formerly risqued drowning to retrieve the little bird that Sophia\r\nhad there lost.\r\n\r\nThis place had been of late much frequented by Sophia. Here she used\r\nto ruminate, with a mixture of pain and pleasure, on an incident\r\nwhich, however trifling in itself, had possibly sown the first seeds\r\nof that affection which was now arrived to such maturity in her heart.\r\n\r\nHere then this young couple met. They were almost close together\r\nbefore either of them knew anything of the other's approach. A\r\nbystander would have discovered sufficient marks of confusion in the\r\ncountenance of each; but they felt too much themselves to make any\r\nobservation. As soon as Jones had a little recovered his first\r\nsurprize, he accosted the young lady with some of the ordinary forms\r\nof salutation, which she in the same manner returned; and their\r\nconversation began, as usual, on the delicious beauty of the morning.\r\nHence they past to the beauty of the place, on which Jones launched\r\nforth very high encomiums. When they came to the tree whence he had\r\nformerly tumbled into the canal, Sophia could not help reminding him\r\nof that accident, and said, “I fancy, Mr Jones, you have some little\r\nshuddering when you see that water.”--“I assure you, madam,” answered\r\nJones, “the concern you felt at the loss of your little bird will\r\nalways appear to me the highest circumstance in that adventure. Poor\r\nlittle Tommy! there is the branch he stood upon. How could the little\r\nwretch have the folly to fly away from that state of happiness in\r\nwhich I had the honour to place him? His fate was a just punishment\r\nfor his ingratitude.”--“Upon my word, Mr Jones,” said she, “your\r\ngallantry very narrowly escaped as severe a fate. Sure the remembrance\r\nmust affect you.”--“Indeed, madam,” answered he, “if I have any reason\r\nto reflect with sorrow on it, it is, perhaps, that the water had not\r\nbeen a little deeper, by which I might have escaped many bitter\r\nheart-aches that Fortune seems to have in store for me.”--“Fie, Mr\r\nJones!” replied Sophia; “I am sure you cannot be in earnest now. This\r\naffected contempt of life is only an excess of your complacence to me.\r\nYou would endeavour to lessen the obligation of having twice ventured\r\nit for my sake. Beware the third time.” She spoke these last words\r\nwith a smile, and a softness inexpressible. Jones answered with a\r\nsigh, “He feared it was already too late for caution:” and then\r\nlooking tenderly and stedfastly on her, he cried, “Oh, Miss Western!\r\ncan you desire me to live? Can you wish me so ill?” Sophia, looking\r\ndown on the ground, answered with some hesitation, “Indeed, Mr Jones,\r\nI do not wish you ill.”--“Oh, I know too well that heavenly temper,”\r\n cries Jones, “that divine goodness, which is beyond every other\r\ncharm.”--“Nay, now,” answered she, “I understand you not. I can stay\r\nno longer.”--“I--I would not be understood!” cries he; “nay, I can't\r\nbe understood. I know not what I say. Meeting you here so\r\nunexpectedly, I have been unguarded: for Heaven's sake pardon me, if I\r\nhave said anything to offend you. I did not mean it. Indeed, I would\r\nrather have died--nay, the very thought would kill me.”--“You surprize\r\nme,” answered she. “How can you possibly think you have offended\r\nme?”--“Fear, madam,” says he, “easily runs into madness; and there is\r\nno degree of fear like that which I feel of offending you. How can I\r\nspeak then? Nay, don't look angrily at me: one frown will destroy me.\r\nI mean nothing. Blame my eyes, or blame those beauties. What am I\r\nsaying? Pardon me if I have said too much. My heart overflowed. I have\r\nstruggled with my love to the utmost, and have endeavoured to conceal\r\na fever which preys on my vitals, and will, I hope, soon make it\r\nimpossible for me ever to offend you more.”\r\n\r\nMr Jones now fell a trembling as if he had been shaken with the fit of\r\nan ague. Sophia, who was in a situation not very different from his,\r\nanswered in these words: “Mr Jones, I will not affect to misunderstand\r\nyou; indeed, I understand you too well; but, for Heaven's sake, if you\r\nhave any affection for me, let me make the best of my way into the\r\nhouse. I wish I may be able to support myself thither.”\r\n\r\nJones, who was hardly able to support himself, offered her his arm,\r\nwhich she condescended to accept, but begged he would not mention a\r\nword more to her of this nature at present. He promised he would not;\r\ninsisting only on her forgiveness of what love, without the leave of\r\nhis will, had forced from him: this, she told him, he knew how to\r\nobtain by his future behaviour; and thus this young pair tottered and\r\ntrembled along, the lover not once daring to squeeze the hand of his\r\nmistress, though it was locked in his.\r\n\r\nSophia immediately retired to her chamber, where Mrs Honour and the\r\nhartshorn were summoned to her assistance. As to poor Jones, the only\r\nrelief to his distempered mind was an unwelcome piece of news, which,\r\nas it opens a scene of different nature from those in which the reader\r\nhath lately been conversant, will be communicated to him in the next\r\nchapter."

      "content": "In which Mr Allworthy appears on a sick-bed.\r\n\nMr Western was become so fond of Jones that he was unwilling to part\r\nwith him, though his arm had been long since cured; and Jones, either\r\nfrom the love of sport, or from some other reason, was easily\r\npersuaded to continue at his house, which he did sometimes for a\r\nfortnight together without paying a single visit at Mr Allworthy's;\r\nnay, without ever hearing from thence.\r\n\r\nMr Allworthy had been for some days indisposed with a cold, which had\r\nbeen attended with a little fever. This he had, however, neglected; as\r\nit was usual with him to do all manner of disorders which did not\r\nconfine him to his bed, or prevent his several faculties from\r\nperforming their ordinary functions;--a conduct which we would by no\r\nmeans be thought to approve or recommend to imitation; for surely the\r\ngentlemen of the Aesculapian art are in the right in advising, that\r\nthe moment the disease has entered at one door, the physician should\r\nbe introduced at the other: what else is meant by that old adage,\r\n_Venienti occurrite morbo?_ “Oppose a distemper at its first\r\napproach.” Thus the doctor and the disease meet in fair and equal\r\nconflict; whereas, by giving time to the latter, we often suffer him\r\nto fortify and entrench himself, like a French army; so that the\r\nlearned gentleman finds it very difficult, and sometimes impossible,\r\nto come at the enemy. Nay, sometimes by gaining time the disease\r\napplies to the French military politics, and corrupts nature over to\r\nhis side, and then all the powers of physic must arrive too late.\r\nAgreeable to these observations was, I remember, the complaint of the\r\ngreat Doctor Misaubin, who used very pathetically to lament the late\r\napplications which were made to his skill, saying, “Bygar, me believe\r\nmy pation take me for de undertaker, for dey never send for me till de\r\nphysicion have kill dem.”\r\n\r\nMr Allworthy's distemper, by means of this neglect, gained such\r\nground, that, when the increase of his fever obliged him to send for\r\nassistance, the doctor at his first arrival shook his head, wished he\r\nhad been sent for sooner, and intimated that he thought him in very\r\nimminent danger. Mr Allworthy, who had settled all his affairs in this\r\nworld, and was as well prepared as it is possible for human nature to\r\nbe for the other, received this information with the utmost calmness\r\nand unconcern. He could, indeed, whenever he laid himself down to\r\nrest, say with Cato in the tragical poem--\r\n\r\n Let guilt or fear\r\n Disturb man's rest: Cato knows neither of them;\r\n Indifferent in his choice to sleep or die.\r\n\r\nIn reality, he could say this with ten times more reason and\r\nconfidence than Cato, or any other proud fellow among the antient or\r\nmodern heroes; for he was not only devoid of fear, but might be\r\nconsidered as a faithful labourer, when at the end of harvest he is\r\nsummoned to receive his reward at the hands of a bountiful master.\r\n\r\nThe good man gave immediate orders for all his family to be summoned\r\nround him. None of these were then abroad, but Mrs Blifil, who had\r\nbeen some time in London, and Mr Jones, whom the reader hath just\r\nparted from at Mr Western's, and who received this summons just as\r\nSophia had left him.\r\n\r\nThe news of Mr Allworthy's danger (for the servant told him he was\r\ndying) drove all thoughts of love out of his head. He hurried\r\ninstantly into the chariot which was sent for him, and ordered the\r\ncoachman to drive with all imaginable haste; nor did the idea of\r\nSophia, I believe, once occur to him on the way.\r\n\r\nAnd now the whole family, namely, Mr Blifil, Mr Jones, Mr Thwackum, Mr\r\nSquare, and some of the servants (for such were Mr Allworthy's orders)\r\nbeing all assembled round his bed, the good man sat up in it, and was\r\nbeginning to speak, when Blifil fell to blubbering, and began to\r\nexpress very loud and bitter lamentations. Upon this Mr Allworthy\r\nshook him by the hand, and said, “Do not sorrow thus, my dear nephew,\r\nat the most ordinary of all human occurrences. When misfortunes befal\r\nour friends we are justly grieved; for those are accidents which might\r\noften have been avoided, and which may seem to render the lot of one\r\nman more peculiarly unhappy than that of others; but death is\r\ncertainly unavoidable, and is that common lot in which alone the\r\nfortunes of all men agree: nor is the time when this happens to us\r\nvery material. If the wisest of men hath compared life to a span,\r\nsurely we may be allowed to consider it as a day. It is my fate to\r\nleave it in the evening; but those who are taken away earlier have\r\nonly lost a few hours, at the best little worth lamenting, and much\r\noftener hours of labour and fatigue, of pain and sorrow. One of the\r\nRoman poets, I remember, likens our leaving life to our departure from\r\na feast;--a thought which hath often occurred to me when I have seen\r\nmen struggling to protract an entertainment, and to enjoy the company\r\nof their friends a few moments longer. Alas! how short is the most\r\nprotracted of such enjoyments! how immaterial the difference between\r\nhim who retires the soonest, and him who stays the latest! This is\r\nseeing life in the best view, and this unwillingness to quit our\r\nfriends is the most amiable motive from which we can derive the fear\r\nof death; and yet the longest enjoyment which we can hope for of this\r\nkind is of so trivial a duration, that it is to a wise man truly\r\ncontemptible. Few men, I own, think in this manner; for, indeed, few\r\nmen think of death till they are in its jaws. However gigantic and\r\nterrible an object this may appear when it approaches them, they are\r\nnevertheless incapable of seeing it at any distance; nay, though they\r\nhave been ever so much alarmed and frightened when they have\r\napprehended themselves in danger of dying, they are no sooner cleared\r\nfrom this apprehension than even the fears of it are erased from their\r\nminds. But, alas! he who escapes from death is not pardoned; he is\r\nonly reprieved, and reprieved to a short day.\r\n\r\n“Grieve, therefore, no more, my dear child, on this occasion: an event\r\nwhich may happen every hour; which every element, nay, almost every\r\nparticle of matter that surrounds us is capable of producing, and\r\nwhich must and will most unavoidably reach us all at last, ought\r\nneither to occasion our surprize nor our lamentation.\r\n\r\n“My physician having acquainted me (which I take very kindly of him)\r\nthat I am in danger of leaving you all very shortly, I have determined\r\nto say a few words to you at this our parting, before my distemper,\r\nwhich I find grows very fast upon me, puts it out of my power.\r\n\r\n“But I shall waste my strength too much. I intended to speak\r\nconcerning my will, which, though I have settled long ago, I think\r\nproper to mention such heads of it as concern any of you, that I may\r\nhave the comfort of perceiving you are all satisfied with the\r\nprovision I have there made for you.\r\n\r\n“Nephew Blifil, I leave you the heir to my whole estate, except only\r\n£500 a-year, which is to revert to you after the death of your mother,\r\nand except one other estate of £500 a-year, and the sum of £6000,\r\nwhich I have bestowed in the following manner:\r\n\r\n“The estate of £500 a-year I have given to you, Mr Jones: and as I\r\nknow the inconvenience which attends the want of ready money, I have\r\nadded £1000 in specie. In this I know not whether I have exceeded or\r\nfallen short of your expectation. Perhaps you will think I have given\r\nyou too little, and the world will be as ready to condemn me for\r\ngiving you too much; but the latter censure I despise; and as to the\r\nformer, unless you should entertain that common error which I have\r\noften heard in my life pleaded as an excuse for a total want of\r\ncharity, namely, that instead of raising gratitude by voluntary acts\r\nof bounty, we are apt to raise demands, which of all others are the\r\nmost boundless and most difficult to satisfy.--Pardon me the bare\r\nmention of this; I will not suspect any such thing.”\r\n\r\nJones flung himself at his benefactor's feet, and taking eagerly hold\r\nof his hand, assured him his goodness to him, both now and all other\r\ntimes, had so infinitely exceeded not only his merit but his hopes,\r\nthat no words could express his sense of it. “And I assure you, sir,”\r\n said he, “your present generosity hath left me no other concern than\r\nfor the present melancholy occasion. Oh, my friend, my father!” Here\r\nhis words choaked him, and he turned away to hide a tear which was\r\nstarting from his eyes.\r\n\r\nAllworthy then gently squeezed his hand, and proceeded thus: “I am\r\nconvinced, my child, that you have much goodness, generosity, and\r\nhonour, in your temper: if you will add prudence and religion to\r\nthese, you must be happy; for the three former qualities, I admit,\r\nmake you worthy of happiness, but they are the latter only which will\r\nput you in possession of it.\r\n\r\n“One thousand pound I have given to you, Mr Thwackum; a sum I am\r\nconvinced which greatly exceeds your desires, as well as your wants.\r\nHowever, you will receive it as a memorial of my friendship; and\r\nwhatever superfluities may redound to you, that piety which you so\r\nrigidly maintain will instruct you how to dispose of them.\r\n\r\n“A like sum, Mr Square, I have bequeathed to you. This, I hope, will\r\nenable you to pursue your profession with better success than\r\nhitherto. I have often observed with concern, that distress is more\r\napt to excite contempt than commiseration, especially among men of\r\nbusiness, with whom poverty is understood to indicate want of ability.\r\nBut the little I have been able to leave you will extricate you from\r\nthose difficulties with which you have formerly struggled; and then I\r\ndoubt not but you will meet with sufficient prosperity to supply what\r\na man of your philosophical temper will require.\r\n\r\n“I find myself growing faint, so I shall refer you to my will for my\r\ndisposition of the residue. My servants will there find some tokens to\r\nremember me by; and there are a few charities which, I trust, my\r\nexecutors will see faithfully performed. Bless you all. I am setting\r\nout a little before you.”--\r\n\r\nHere a footman came hastily into the room, and said there was an\r\nattorney from Salisbury who had a particular message, which he said he\r\nmust communicate to Mr Allworthy himself: that he seemed in a violent\r\nhurry, and protested he had so much business to do, that, if he could\r\ncut himself into four quarters, all would not be sufficient.\r\n\r\n“Go, child,” said Allworthy to Blifil, “see what the gentleman wants.\r\nI am not able to do any business now, nor can he have any with me, in\r\nwhich you are not at present more concerned than myself. Besides, I\r\nreally am--I am incapable of seeing any one at present, or of any\r\nlonger attention.” He then saluted them all, saying, perhaps he should\r\nbe able to see them again, but he should be now glad to compose\r\nhimself a little, finding that he had too much exhausted his spirits\r\nin discourse.\r\n\r\nSome of the company shed tears at their parting; and even the\r\nphilosopher Square wiped his eyes, albeit unused to the melting mood.\r\nAs to Mrs Wilkins, she dropt her pearls as fast as the Arabian trees\r\ntheir medicinal gums; for this was a ceremonial which that gentlewoman\r\nnever omitted on a proper occasion.\r\n\r\nAfter this Mr Allworthy again laid himself down on his pillow, and\r\nendeavoured to compose himself to rest."

      "content": "Containing matter rather natural than pleasing.\r\n\nBesides grief for her master, there was another source for that briny\r\nstream which so plentifully rose above the two mountainous cheek-bones\r\nof the housekeeper. She was no sooner retired, than she began to\r\nmutter to herself in the following pleasant strain: “Sure master might\r\nhave made some difference, methinks, between me and the other\r\nservants. I suppose he hath left me mourning; but, i'fackins! if that\r\nbe all, the devil shall wear it for him, for me. I'd have his worship\r\nknow I am no beggar. I have saved five hundred pound in his service,\r\nand after all to be used in this manner.--It is a fine encouragement\r\nto servants to be honest; and to be sure, if I have taken a little\r\nsomething now and then, others have taken ten times as much; and now\r\nwe are all put in a lump together. If so be that it be so, the legacy\r\nmay go to the devil with him that gave it. No, I won't give it up\r\nneither, because that will please some folks. No, I'll buy the gayest\r\ngown I can get, and dance over the old curmudgeon's grave in it. This\r\nis my reward for taking his part so often, when all the country have\r\ncried shame of him, for breeding up his bastard in that manner; but he\r\nis going now where he must pay for all. It would have become him\r\nbetter to have repented of his sins on his deathbed, than to glory in\r\nthem, and give away his estate out of his own family to a misbegotten\r\nchild. Found in his bed, forsooth! a pretty story! ay, ay, those that\r\nhide know where to find. Lord forgive him! I warrant he hath many more\r\nbastards to answer for, if the truth was known. One comfort is, they\r\nwill all be known where he is a going now.--`The servants will find\r\nsome token to remember me by.' Those were the very words; I shall\r\nnever forget them, if I was to live a thousand years. Ay, ay, I shall\r\nremember you for huddling me among the servants. One would have\r\nthought he might have mentioned my name as well as that of Square; but\r\nhe is a gentleman forsooth, though he had not cloths on his back when\r\nhe came hither first. Marry come up with such gentlemen! though he\r\nhath lived here this many years, I don't believe there is arrow a\r\nservant in the house ever saw the colour of his money. The devil shall\r\nwait upon such a gentleman for me.” Much more of the like kind she\r\nmuttered to herself; but this taste shall suffice to the reader.\r\n\r\nNeither Thwackum nor Square were much better satisfied with their\r\nlegacies. Though they breathed not their resentment so loud, yet from\r\nthe discontent which appeared in their countenances, as well as from\r\nthe following dialogue, we collect that no great pleasure reigned in\r\ntheir minds.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour after they had left the sick-room, Square met Thwackum\r\nin the hall and accosted him thus: “Well, sir, have you heard any news\r\nof your friend since we parted from him?”--“If you mean Mr Allworthy,”\r\n answered Thwackum, “I think you might rather give him the appellation\r\nof your friend; for he seems to me to have deserved that title.”--“The\r\ntitle is as good on your side,” replied Square, “for his bounty, such\r\nas it is, hath been equal to both.”--“I should not have mentioned it\r\nfirst,” cries Thwackum, “but since you begin, I must inform you I am\r\nof a different opinion. There is a wide distinction between voluntary\r\nfavours and rewards. The duty I have done in his family, and the care\r\nI have taken in the education of his two boys, are services for which\r\nsome men might have expected a greater return. I would not have you\r\nimagine I am therefore dissatisfied; for St Paul hath taught me to\r\nbe content with the little I have. Had the modicum been less, I\r\nshould have known my duty. But though the Scriptures obliges me to\r\nremain contented, it doth not enjoin me to shut my eyes to my own\r\nmerit, nor restrain me from seeing when I am injured by an unjust\r\ncomparison.”--“Since you provoke me,” returned Square, “that injury is\r\ndone to me; nor did I ever imagine Mr Allworthy had held my friendship\r\nso light, as to put me in balance with one who received his wages. I\r\nknow to what it is owing; it proceeds from those narrow principles\r\nwhich you have been so long endeavouring to infuse into him, in\r\ncontempt of everything which is great and noble. The beauty and\r\nloveliness of friendship is too strong for dim eyes, nor can it be\r\nperceived by any other medium than that unerring rule of right, which\r\nyou have so often endeavoured to ridicule, that you have perverted\r\nyour friend's understanding.”--“I wish,” cries Thwackum, in a rage, “I\r\nwish, for the sake of his soul, your damnable doctrines have not\r\nperverted his faith. It is to this I impute his present behaviour, so\r\nunbecoming a Christian. Who but an atheist could think of leaving the\r\nworld without having first made up his account? without confessing his\r\nsins, and receiving that absolution which he knew he had one in the\r\nhouse duly authorized to give him? He will feel the want of these\r\nnecessaries when it is too late, when he is arrived at that place\r\nwhere there is wailing and gnashing of teeth. It is then he will find\r\nin what mighty stead that heathen goddess, that virtue, which you and\r\nall other deists of the age adore, will stand him. He will then summon\r\nhis priest, when there is none to be found, and will lament the want\r\nof that absolution, without which no sinner can be safe.”--“If it be\r\nso material,” says Square, “why don't you present it him of your own\r\naccord?” “It hath no virtue,” cries Thwackum, “but to those who have\r\nsufficient grace to require it. But why do I talk thus to a heathen\r\nand an unbeliever? It is you that taught him this lesson, for which\r\nyou have been well rewarded in this world, as I doubt not your\r\ndisciple will soon be in the other.”--“I know not what you mean by\r\nreward,” said Square; “but if you hint at that pitiful memorial of our\r\nfriendship, which he hath thought fit to bequeath me, I despise it;\r\nand nothing but the unfortunate situation of my circumstances should\r\nprevail on me to accept it.”\r\n\r\nThe physician now arrived, and began to inquire of the two disputants,\r\nhow we all did above-stairs? “In a miserable way,” answered Thwackum.\r\n“It is no more than I expected,” cries the doctor: “but pray what\r\nsymptoms have appeared since I left you?”--“No good ones, I am\r\nafraid,” replied Thwackum: “after what past at our departure, I think\r\nthere were little hopes.” The bodily physician, perhaps, misunderstood\r\nthe curer of souls; and before they came to an explanation, Mr Blifil\r\ncame to them with a most melancholy countenance, and acquainted them\r\nthat he brought sad news, that his mother was dead at Salisbury; that\r\nshe had been seized on the road home with the gout in her head and\r\nstomach, which had carried her off in a few hours. “Good-lack-a-day!”\r\n says the doctor. “One cannot answer for events; but I wish I had been\r\nat hand, to have been called in. The gout is a distemper which it is\r\ndifficult to treat; yet I have been remarkably successful in it.”\r\n Thwackum and Square both condoled with Mr Blifil for the loss of his\r\nmother, which the one advised him to bear like a man, and the other\r\nlike a Christian. The young gentleman said he knew very well we were\r\nall mortal, and he would endeavour to submit to his loss as well as he\r\ncould. That he could not, however, help complaining a little against\r\nthe peculiar severity of his fate, which brought the news of so great\r\na calamity to him by surprize, and that at a time when he hourly\r\nexpected the severest blow he was capable of feeling from the malice\r\nof fortune. He said, the present occasion would put to the test those\r\nexcellent rudiments which he had learnt from Mr Thwackum and Mr\r\nSquare; and it would be entirely owing to them, if he was enabled to\r\nsurvive such misfortunes.\r\n\r\nIt was now debated whether Mr Allworthy should be informed of the\r\ndeath of his sister. This the doctor violently opposed; in which, I\r\nbelieve, the whole college would agree with him: but Mr Blifil said,\r\nhe had received such positive and repeated orders from his uncle,\r\nnever to keep any secret from him for fear of the disquietude which it\r\nmight give him, that he durst not think of disobedience, whatever\r\nmight be the consequence. He said, for his part, considering the\r\nreligious and philosophic temper of his uncle, he could not agree with\r\nthe doctor in his apprehensions. He was therefore resolved to\r\ncommunicate it to him: for if his uncle recovered (as he heartily\r\nprayed he might) he knew he would never forgive an endeavour to keep a\r\nsecret of this kind from him.\r\n\r\nThe physician was forced to submit to these resolutions, which the two\r\nother learned gentlemen very highly commended. So together moved Mr\r\nBlifil and the doctor toward the sick-room; where the physician first\r\nentered, and approached the bed, in order to feel his patient's pulse,\r\nwhich he had no sooner done, than he declared he was much better; that\r\nthe last application had succeeded to a miracle, and had brought the\r\nfever to intermit: so that, he said, there appeared now to be as\r\nlittle danger as he had before apprehended there were hopes.\r\n\r\nTo say the truth, Mr Allworthy's situation had never been so bad as\r\nthe great caution of the doctor had represented it: but as a wise\r\ngeneral never despises his enemy, however inferior that enemy's force\r\nmay be, so neither doth a wise physician ever despise a distemper,\r\nhowever inconsiderable. As the former preserves the same strict\r\ndiscipline, places the same guards, and employs the same scouts,\r\nthough the enemy be never so weak; so the latter maintains the same\r\ngravity of countenance, and shakes his head with the same significant\r\nair, let the distemper be never so trifling. And both, among many\r\nother good ones, may assign this solid reason for their conduct, that\r\nby these means the greater glory redounds to them if they gain the\r\nvictory, and the less disgrace if by any unlucky accident they should\r\nhappen to be conquered.\r\n\r\nMr Allworthy had no sooner lifted up his eyes, and thanked Heaven for\r\nthese hopes of his recovery, than Mr Blifil drew near, with a very\r\ndejected aspect, and having applied his handkerchief to his eye,\r\neither to wipe away his tears, or to do as Ovid somewhere expresses\r\nhimself on another occasion\r\n\r\n _Si nullus erit, tamen excute nullum,_\r\n\r\n If there be none, then wipe away that none,\r\n\r\nhe communicated to his uncle what the reader hath been just before\r\nacquainted with.\r\n\r\nAllworthy received the news with concern, with patience, and with\r\nresignation. He dropt a tender tear, then composed his countenance,\r\nand at last cried, “The Lord's will be done in everything.”\r\n\r\nHe now enquired for the messenger; but Blifil told him it had been\r\nimpossible to detain him a moment; for he appeared by the great hurry\r\nhe was in to have some business of importance on his hands; that he\r\ncomplained of being hurried and driven and torn out of his life, and\r\nrepeated many times, that if he could divide himself into four\r\nquarters, he knew how to dispose of every one.\r\n\r\nAllworthy then desired Blifil to take care of the funeral. He said, he\r\nwould have his sister deposited in his own chapel; and as to the\r\nparticulars, he left them to his own discretion, only mentioning the\r\nperson whom he would have employed on this occasion."

      "content": "Which, among other things, may serve as a comment on that saying of\r\nAeschines, that “drunkenness shows the mind of a man, as a mirrour\r\nreflects his person.”\r\n\nThe reader may perhaps wonder at hearing nothing of Mr Jones in the\r\nlast chapter. In fact, his behaviour was so different from that of the\r\npersons there mentioned, that we chose not to confound his name with\r\ntheirs.\r\n\r\nWhen the good man had ended his speech, Jones was the last who\r\ndeserted the room. Thence he retired to his own apartment, to give\r\nvent to his concern; but the restlessness of his mind would not suffer\r\nhim to remain long there; he slipped softly therefore to Allworthy's\r\nchamber-door, where he listened a considerable time without hearing\r\nany kind of motion within, unless a violent snoring, which at last his\r\nfears misrepresented as groans. This so alarmed him, that he could not\r\nforbear entering the room; where he found the good man in the bed, in\r\na sweet composed sleep, and his nurse snoring in the above mentioned\r\nhearty manner, at the bed's feet. He immediately took the only method\r\nof silencing this thorough bass, whose music he feared might disturb\r\nMr Allworthy; and then sitting down by the nurse, he remained\r\nmotionless till Blifil and the doctor came in together and waked the\r\nsick man, in order that the doctor might feel his pulse, and that the\r\nother might communicate to him that piece of news, which, had Jones\r\nbeen apprized of it, would have had great difficulty of finding its\r\nway to Mr Allworthy's ear at such a season.\r\n\r\nWhen he first heard Blifil tell his uncle this story, Jones could\r\nhardly contain the wrath which kindled in him at the other's\r\nindiscretion, especially as the doctor shook his head, and declared\r\nhis unwillingness to have the matter mentioned to his patient. But as\r\nhis passion did not so far deprive him of all use of his\r\nunderstanding, as to hide from him the consequences which any violent\r\nexpression towards Blifil might have on the sick, this apprehension\r\nstilled his rage at the present; and he grew afterwards so satisfied\r\nwith finding that this news had, in fact, produced no mischief, that\r\nhe suffered his anger to die in his own bosom, without ever mentioning\r\nit to Blifil.\r\n\r\nThe physician dined that day at Mr Allworthy's; and having after\r\ndinner visited his patient, he returned to the company, and told them,\r\nthat he had now the satisfaction to say, with assurance, that his\r\npatient was out of all danger: that he had brought his fever to a\r\nperfect intermission, and doubted not by throwing in the bark to\r\nprevent its return.\r\n\r\nThis account so pleased Jones, and threw him into such immoderate\r\nexcess of rapture, that he might be truly said to be drunk with\r\njoy--an intoxication which greatly forwards the effects of wine; and\r\nas he was very free too with the bottle on this occasion (for he drank\r\nmany bumpers to the doctor's health, as well as to other toasts) he\r\nbecame very soon literally drunk.\r\n\r\nJones had naturally violent animal spirits: these being set on float\r\nand augmented by the spirit of wine, produced most extravagant\r\neffects. He kissed the doctor, and embraced him with the most\r\npassionate endearments; swearing that next to Mr Allworthy himself, he\r\nloved him of all men living. “Doctor,” added he, “you deserve a statue\r\nto be erected to you at the public expense, for having preserved a\r\nman, who is not only the darling of all good men who know him, but a\r\nblessing to society, the glory of his country, and an honour to human\r\nnature. D--n me if I don't love him better than my own soul.”\r\n\r\n“More shame for you,” cries Thwackum. “Though I think you have reason\r\nto love him, for he hath provided very well for you. And perhaps it\r\nmight have been better for some folks that he had not lived to see\r\njust reason of revoking his gift.”\r\n\r\nJones now looking on Thwackum with inconceivable disdain, answered,\r\n“And doth thy mean soul imagine that any such considerations could\r\nweigh with me? No, let the earth open and swallow her own dirt (if I\r\nhad millions of acres I would say it) rather than swallow up my dear\r\nglorious friend.”\r\n\r\n _Quis desiderio sit pudor aut modus\r\n Tam chari capitis?_[*]\r\n\r\n [*] “What modesty or measure can set bounds to our desire of so dear\r\n a friend?” The word _desiderium_ here cannot be easily translated.\r\n It includes our desire of enjoying our friend again, and the grief\r\n which attends that desire.\r\n\r\nThe doctor now interposed, and prevented the effects of a wrath which\r\nwas kindling between Jones and Thwackum; after which the former gave a\r\nloose to mirth, sang two or three amorous songs, and fell into every\r\nfrantic disorder which unbridled joy is apt to inspire; but so far was\r\nhe from any disposition to quarrel, that he was ten times better\r\nhumoured, if possible, than when he was sober.\r\n\r\nTo say truth, nothing is more erroneous than the common observation,\r\nthat men who are ill-natured and quarrelsome when they are drunk, are\r\nvery worthy persons when they are sober: for drink, in reality, doth\r\nnot reverse nature, or create passions in men which did not exist in\r\nthem before. It takes away the guard of reason, and consequently\r\nforces us to produce those symptoms, which many, when sober, have art\r\nenough to conceal. It heightens and inflames our passions (generally\r\nindeed that passion which is uppermost in our mind), so that the angry\r\ntemper, the amorous, the generous, the good-humoured, the avaricious,\r\nand all other dispositions of men, are in their cups heightened and\r\nexposed.\r\n\r\nAnd yet as no nation produces so many drunken quarrels, especially\r\namong the lower people, as England (for indeed, with them, to drink\r\nand to fight together are almost synonymous terms), I would not,\r\nmethinks, have it thence concluded, that the English are the\r\nworst-natured people alive. Perhaps the love of glory only is at the\r\nbottom of this; so that the fair conclusion seems to be, that our\r\ncountrymen have more of that love, and more of bravery, than any other\r\nplebeians. And this the rather, as there is seldom anything\r\nungenerous, unfair, or ill-natured, exercised on these occasions: nay,\r\nit is common for the combatants to express good-will for each other\r\neven at the time of the conflict; and as their drunken mirth generally\r\nends in a battle, so do most of their battles end in friendship.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our history. Though Jones had shown no design of\r\ngiving offence, yet Mr Blifil was highly offended at a behaviour which\r\nwas so inconsistent with the sober and prudent reserve of his own\r\ntemper. He bore it too with the greater impatience, as it appeared to\r\nhim very indecent at this season; “When,” as he said, “the house was a\r\nhouse of mourning, on the account of his dear mother; and if it had\r\npleased Heaven to give him some prospect of Mr Allworthy's recovery,\r\nit would become them better to express the exultations of their hearts\r\nin thanksgiving, than in drunkenness and riots; which were properer\r\nmethods to encrease the Divine wrath, than to avert it.” Thwackum, who\r\nhad swallowed more liquor than Jones, but without any ill effect on\r\nhis brain, seconded the pious harangue of Blifil; but Square, for\r\nreasons which the reader may probably guess, was totally silent.\r\n\r\nWine had not so totally overpowered Jones, as to prevent his\r\nrecollecting Mr Blifil's loss, the moment it was mentioned. As no\r\nperson, therefore, was more ready to confess and condemn his own\r\nerrors, he offered to shake Mr Blifil by the hand, and begged his\r\npardon, saying, “His excessive joy for Mr Allworthy's recovery had\r\ndriven every other thought out of his mind.”\r\n\r\nBlifil scornfully rejected his hand; and with much indignation\r\nanswered, “It was little to be wondered at, if tragical spectacles\r\nmade no impression on the blind; but, for his part, he had the\r\nmisfortune to know who his parents were, and consequently must be\r\naffected with their loss.”\r\n\r\nJones, who, notwithstanding his good humour, had some mixture of the\r\nirascible in his constitution, leaped hastily from his chair, and\r\ncatching hold of Blifil's collar, cried out, “D--n you for a rascal,\r\ndo you insult me with the misfortune of my birth?” He accompanied\r\nthese words with such rough actions, that they soon got the better of\r\nMr Blifil's peaceful temper; and a scuffle immediately ensued, which\r\nmight have produced mischief, had it not been prevented by the\r\ninterposition of Thwackum and the physician; for the philosophy of\r\nSquare rendered him superior to all emotions, and he very calmly\r\nsmoaked his pipe, as was his custom in all broils, unless when he\r\napprehended some danger of having it broke in his mouth.\r\n\r\nThe combatants being now prevented from executing present vengeance on\r\neach other, betook themselves to the common resources of disappointed\r\nrage, and vented their wrath in threats and defiance. In this kind of\r\nconflict, Fortune, which, in the personal attack, seemed to incline to\r\nJones, was now altogether as favourable to his enemy.\r\n\r\nA truce, nevertheless, was at length agreed on, by the mediation of\r\nthe neutral parties, and the whole company again sat down at the\r\ntable; where Jones being prevailed on to ask pardon, and Blifil to\r\ngive it, peace was restored, and everything seemed _in statu quo_.\r\n\r\nBut though the quarrel was, in all appearance, perfectly reconciled,\r\nthe good humour which had been interrupted by it, was by no means\r\nrestored. All merriment was now at an end, and the subsequent\r\ndiscourse consisted only of grave relations of matters of fact, and of\r\nas grave observations upon them; a species of conversation, in which,\r\nthough there is much of dignity and instruction, there is but little\r\nentertainment. As we presume therefore to convey only this last to the\r\nreader, we shall pass by whatever was said, till the rest of the\r\ncompany having by degrees dropped off, left only Square and the\r\nphysician together; at which time the conversation was a little\r\nheightened by some comments on what had happened between the two young\r\ngentlemen; both of whom the doctor declared to be no better than\r\nscoundrels; to which appellation the philosopher, very sagaciously\r\nshaking his head, agreed."

      "content": "Showing the truth of many observations of Ovid, and of other more\r\ngrave writers, who have proved beyond contradiction, that wine is\r\noften the forerunner of incontinency.\r\n\nJones retired from the company, in which we have seen him engaged,\r\ninto the fields, where he intended to cool himself by a walk in the\r\nopen air before he attended Mr Allworthy. There, whilst he renewed\r\nthose meditations on his dear Sophia, which the dangerous illness of\r\nhis friend and benefactor had for some time interrupted, an accident\r\nhappened, which with sorrow we relate, and with sorrow doubtless will\r\nit be read; however, that historic truth to which we profess so\r\ninviolable an attachment, obliges us to communicate it to posterity.\r\n\r\nIt was now a pleasant evening in the latter end of June, when our\r\nheroe was walking in a most delicious grove, where the gentle breezes\r\nfanning the leaves, together with the sweet trilling of a murmuring\r\nstream, and the melodious notes of nightingales, formed altogether the\r\nmost enchanting harmony. In this scene, so sweetly accommodated to\r\nlove, he meditated on his dear Sophia. While his wanton fancy roamed\r\nunbounded over all her beauties, and his lively imagination painted\r\nthe charming maid in various ravishing forms, his warm heart melted\r\nwith tenderness; and at length, throwing himself on the ground, by the\r\nside of a gently murmuring brook, he broke forth into the following\r\nejaculation:\r\n\r\n“O Sophia, would Heaven give thee to my arms, how blest would be my\r\ncondition! Curst be that fortune which sets a distance between us. Was\r\nI but possessed of thee, one only suit of rags thy whole estate, is\r\nthere a man on earth whom I would envy! How contemptible would the\r\nbrightest Circassian beauty, drest in all the jewels of the Indies,\r\nappear to my eyes! But why do I mention another woman? Could I think\r\nmy eyes capable of looking at any other with tenderness, these hands\r\nshould tear them from my head. No, my Sophia, if cruel fortune\r\nseparates us for ever, my soul shall doat on thee alone. The chastest\r\nconstancy will I ever preserve to thy image. Though I should never\r\nhave possession of thy charming person, still shalt thou alone have\r\npossession of my thoughts, my love, my soul. Oh! my fond heart is so\r\nwrapt in that tender bosom, that the brightest beauties would for me\r\nhave no charms, nor would a hermit be colder in their embraces.\r\nSophia, Sophia alone shall be mine. What raptures are in that name! I\r\nwill engrave it on every tree.”\r\n\r\nAt these words he started up, and beheld--not his Sophia--no, nor a\r\nCircassian maid richly and elegantly attired for the grand Signior's\r\nseraglio. No; without a gown, in a shift that was somewhat of the\r\ncoarsest, and none of the cleanest, bedewed likewise with some\r\nodoriferous effluvia, the produce of the day's labour, with a\r\npitchfork in her hand, Molly Seagrim approached. Our hero had his\r\npenknife in his hand, which he had drawn for the before-mentioned\r\npurpose of carving on the bark; when the girl coming near him, cryed\r\nout with a smile, “You don't intend to kill me, squire, I hope!”--“Why\r\nshould you think I would kill you?” answered Jones. “Nay,” replied\r\nshe, “after your cruel usage of me when I saw you last, killing me\r\nwould, perhaps, be too great kindness for me to expect.”\r\n\r\nHere ensued a parley, which, as I do not think myself obliged to\r\nrelate it, I shall omit. It is sufficient that it lasted a full\r\nquarter of an hour, at the conclusion of which they retired into the\r\nthickest part of the grove.\r\n\r\nSome of my readers may be inclined to think this event unnatural.\r\nHowever, the fact is true; and perhaps may be sufficiently accounted\r\nfor by suggesting, that Jones probably thought one woman better than\r\nnone, and Molly as probably imagined two men to be better than one.\r\nBesides the before-mentioned motive assigned to the present behaviour\r\nof Jones, the reader will be likewise pleased to recollect in his\r\nfavour, that he was not at this time perfect master of that wonderful\r\npower of reason, which so well enables grave and wise men to subdue\r\ntheir unruly passions, and to decline any of these prohibited\r\namusements. Wine now had totally subdued this power in Jones. He was,\r\nindeed, in a condition, in which, if reason had interposed, though\r\nonly to advise, she might have received the answer which one\r\nCleostratus gave many years ago to a silly fellow, who asked him, if\r\nhe was not ashamed to be drunk? “Are not you,” said Cleostratus,\r\n“ashamed to admonish a drunken man?”--To say the truth, in a court of\r\njustice drunkenness must not be an excuse, yet in a court of\r\nconscience it is greatly so; and therefore Aristotle, who commends the\r\nlaws of Pittacus, by which drunken men received double punishment for\r\ntheir crimes, allows there is more of policy than justice in that law.\r\nNow, if there are any transgressions pardonable from drunkenness, they\r\nare certainly such as Mr Jones was at present guilty of; on which head\r\nI could pour forth a vast profusion of learning, if I imagined it\r\nwould either entertain my reader, or teach him anything more than he\r\nknows already. For his sake therefore I shall keep my learning to\r\nmyself, and return to my history.\r\n\r\nIt hath been observed, that Fortune seldom doth things by halves. To\r\nsay truth, there is no end to her freaks whenever she is disposed to\r\ngratify or displease. No sooner had our heroe retired with his Dido,\r\nbut\r\n\r\n _Speluncam_ Blifil _dux et divinus eandem\r\n Deveniunt--_\r\n\r\nthe parson and the young squire, who were taking a serious walk,\r\narrived at the stile which leads into the grove, and the latter caught\r\na view of the lovers just as they were sinking out of sight.\r\n\r\nBlifil knew Jones very well, though he was at above a hundred yards'\r\ndistance, and he was as positive to the sex of his companion, though\r\nnot to the individual person. He started, blessed himself, and uttered\r\na very solemn ejaculation.\r\n\r\nThwackum expressed some surprize at these sudden emotions, and asked\r\nthe reason of them. To which Blifil answered, “He was certain he had\r\nseen a fellow and wench retire together among the bushes, which he\r\ndoubted not was with some wicked purpose.” As to the name of Jones, he\r\nthought proper to conceal it, and why he did so must be left to the\r\njudgment of the sagacious reader; for we never chuse to assign motives\r\nto the actions of men, when there is any possibility of our being\r\nmistaken.\r\n\r\nThe parson, who was not only strictly chaste in his own person, but a\r\ngreat enemy to the opposite vice in all others, fired at this\r\ninformation. He desired Mr Blifil to conduct him immediately to the\r\nplace, which as he approached he breathed forth vengeance mixed with\r\nlamentations; nor did he refrain from casting some oblique reflections\r\non Mr Allworthy; insinuating that the wickedness of the country was\r\nprincipally owing to the encouragement he had given to vice, by having\r\nexerted such kindness to a bastard, and by having mitigated that just\r\nand wholesome rigour of the law which allots a very severe punishment\r\nto loose wenches.\r\n\r\nThe way through which our hunters were to pass in pursuit of their\r\ngame was so beset with briars, that it greatly obstructed their walk,\r\nand caused besides such a rustling, that Jones had sufficient warning\r\nof their arrival before they could surprize him; nay, indeed, so\r\nincapable was Thwackum of concealing his indignation, and such\r\nvengeance did he mutter forth every step he took, that this alone must\r\nhave abundantly satisfied Jones that he was (to use the language of\r\nsportsmen) found sitting."

      "content": "In which a simile in Mr Pope's period of a mile introduces as bloody a\r\nbattle as can possibly be fought without the assistance of steel or\r\ncold iron.\r\n\nAs in the season of _rutting_ (an uncouth phrase, by which the vulgar\r\ndenote that gentle dalliance, which in the well-wooded[*] forest of\r\nHampshire, passes between lovers of the ferine kind), if, while the\r\nlofty-crested stag meditates the amorous sport, a couple of puppies,\r\nor any other beasts of hostile note, should wander so near the temple\r\nof Venus Ferina that the fair hind should shrink from the place,\r\ntouched with that somewhat, either of fear or frolic, of nicety or\r\nskittishness, with which nature hath bedecked all females, or hath at\r\nleast instructed them how to put it on; lest, through the indelicacy\r\nof males, the Samean mysteries should be pryed into by unhallowed\r\neyes: for, at the celebration of these rites, the female priestess\r\ncries out with her in Virgil (who was then, probably, hard at work on\r\nsuch celebration),\r\n\r\n _--Procul, o procul este, profani;\r\n Proclamat vates, totoque absistite luco._\r\n\r\n --Far hence be souls profane,\r\n The sibyl cry'd, and from the grove abstain.--DRYDEN.\r\n\r\n [*] This is an ambiguous phrase, and may mean either a forest well\r\n cloathed with wood, or well stript of it.\r\n\r\nIf, I say, while these sacred rites, which are in common to _genus\r\nomne animantium,_ are in agitation between the stag and his mistress,\r\nany hostile beasts should venture too near, on the first hint given by\r\nthe frighted hind, fierce and tremendous rushes forth the stag to the\r\nentrance of the thicket; there stands he centinel over his love,\r\nstamps the ground with his foot, and with his horns brandished aloft\r\nin air, proudly provokes the apprehended foe to combat.\r\n\r\nThus, and more terrible, when he perceived the enemy's approach,\r\nleaped forth our heroe. Many a step advanced he forwards, in order to\r\nconceal the trembling hind, and, if possible, to secure her retreat.\r\nAnd now Thwackum, having first darted some livid lightning from his\r\nfiery eyes, began to thunder forth, “Fie upon it! Fie upon it! Mr\r\nJones. Is it possible you should be the person?”--“You see,” answered\r\nJones, “it is possible I should be here.”--“And who,” said Thwackum,\r\n“is that wicked slut with you?”--“If I have any wicked slut with me,”\r\n cries Jones, “it is possible I shall not let you know who she is.”--“I\r\ncommand you to tell me immediately,” says Thwackum: “and I would not\r\nhave you imagine, young man, that your age, though it hath somewhat\r\nabridged the purpose of tuition, hath totally taken away the authority\r\nof the master. The relation of the master and scholar is indelible;\r\nas, indeed, all other relations are; for they all derive their\r\noriginal from heaven. I would have you think yourself, therefore, as\r\nmuch obliged to obey me now, as when I taught you your first\r\nrudiments.”--“I believe you would,” cries Jones; “but that will not\r\nhappen, unless you had the same birchen argument to convince\r\nme.”--“Then I must tell you plainly,” said Thwackum, “I am resolved to\r\ndiscover the wicked wretch.”--“And I must tell you plainly,” returned\r\nJones, “I am resolved you shall not.” Thwackum then offered to\r\nadvance, and Jones laid hold of his arms; which Mr Blifil endeavoured\r\nto rescue, declaring, “he would not see his old master insulted.”\r\n\r\nJones now finding himself engaged with two, thought it necessary to\r\nrid himself of one of his antagonists as soon as possible. He\r\ntherefore applied to the weakest first; and, letting the parson go, he\r\ndirected a blow at the young squire's breast, which luckily taking\r\nplace, reduced him to measure his length on the ground.\r\n\r\nThwackum was so intent on the discovery, that, the moment he found\r\nhimself at liberty, he stept forward directly into the fern, without\r\nany great consideration of what might in the meantime befal his\r\nfriend; but he had advanced a very few paces into the thicket, before\r\nJones, having defeated Blifil, overtook the parson, and dragged him\r\nbackward by the skirt of his coat.\r\n\r\nThis parson had been a champion in his youth, and had won much honour\r\nby his fist, both at school and at the university. He had now indeed,\r\nfor a great number of years, declined the practice of that noble art;\r\nyet was his courage full as strong as his faith, and his body no less\r\nstrong than either. He was moreover, as the reader may perhaps have\r\nconceived, somewhat irascible in his nature. When he looked back,\r\ntherefore, and saw his friend stretched out on the ground, and found\r\nhimself at the same time so roughly handled by one who had formerly\r\nbeen only passive in all conflicts between them (a circumstance which\r\nhighly aggravated the whole), his patience at length gave way; he\r\nthrew himself into a posture of offence; and collecting all his force,\r\nattacked Jones in the front with as much impetuosity as he had\r\nformerly attacked him in the rear.\r\n\r\nOur heroe received the enemy's attack with the most undaunted\r\nintrepidity, and his bosom resounded with the blow. This he presently\r\nreturned with no less violence, aiming likewise at the parson's\r\nbreast; but he dexterously drove down the fist of Jones, so that it\r\nreached only his belly, where two pounds of beef and as many of\r\npudding were then deposited, and whence consequently no hollow sound\r\ncould proceed. Many lusty blows, much more pleasant as well as easy to\r\nhave seen, than to read or describe, were given on both sides: at last\r\na violent fall, in which Jones had thrown his knees into Thwackum's\r\nbreast, so weakened the latter, that victory had been no longer\r\ndubious, had not Blifil, who had now recovered his strength, again\r\nrenewed the fight, and by engaging with Jones, given the parson a\r\nmoment's time to shake his ears, and to regain his breath.\r\n\r\nAnd now both together attacked our heroe, whose blows did not retain\r\nthat force with which they had fallen at first, so weakened was he by\r\nhis combat with Thwackum; for though the pedagogue chose rather to\r\nplay _solos_ on the human instrument, and had been lately used to\r\nthose only, yet he still retained enough of his antient knowledge to\r\nperform his part very well in a _duet_.\r\n\r\nThe victory, according to modern custom, was like to be decided by\r\nnumbers, when, on a sudden, a fourth pair of fists appeared in the\r\nbattle, and immediately paid their compliments to the parson; and the\r\nowner of them at the same time crying out, “Are not you ashamed, and\r\nbe d--n'd to you, to fall two of you upon one?”\r\n\r\nThe battle, which was of the kind that for distinction's sake is\r\ncalled royal, now raged with the utmost violence during a few minutes;\r\ntill Blifil being a second time laid sprawling by Jones, Thwackum\r\ncondescended to apply for quarter to his new antagonist, who was now\r\nfound to be Mr Western himself; for in the heat of the action none of\r\nthe combatants had recognized him.\r\n\r\nIn fact, that honest squire, happening, in his afternoon's walk with\r\nsome company, to pass through the field where the bloody battle was\r\nfought, and having concluded, from seeing three men engaged, that two\r\nof them must be on a side, he hastened from his companions, and with\r\nmore gallantry than policy, espoused the cause of the weaker party. By\r\nwhich generous proceeding he very probably prevented Mr Jones from\r\nbecoming a victim to the wrath of Thwackum, and to the pious\r\nfriendship which Blifil bore his old master; for, besides the\r\ndisadvantage of such odds, Jones had not yet sufficiently recovered\r\nthe former strength of his broken arm. This reinforcement, however,\r\nsoon put an end to the action, and Jones with his ally obtained the\r\nvictory."

      "content": "In which is seen a more moving spectacle than all the blood in the\r\nbodies of Thwackum and Blifil, and of twenty other such, is capable of\r\nproducing.\r\n\nThe rest of Mr Western's company were now come up, being just at the\r\ninstant when the action was over. These were the honest clergyman,\r\nwhom we have formerly seen at Mr Western's table; Mrs Western, the\r\naunt of Sophia; and lastly, the lovely Sophia herself.\r\n\r\nAt this time, the following was the aspect of the bloody field. In one\r\nplace lay on the ground, all pale, and almost breathless, the\r\nvanquished Blifil. Near him stood the conqueror Jones, almost covered\r\nwith blood, part of which was naturally his own, and part had been\r\nlately the property of the Reverend Mr Thwackum. In a third place\r\nstood the said Thwackum, like King Porus, sullenly submitting to the\r\nconqueror. The last figure in the piece was Western the Great, most\r\ngloriously forbearing the vanquished foe.\r\n\r\nBlifil, in whom there was little sign of life, was at first the\r\nprincipal object of the concern of every one, and particularly of Mrs\r\nWestern, who had drawn from her pocket a bottle of hartshorn, and was\r\nherself about to apply it to his nostrils, when on a sudden the\r\nattention of the whole company was diverted from poor Blifil, whose\r\nspirit, if it had any such design, might have now taken an opportunity\r\nof stealing off to the other world, without any ceremony.\r\n\r\nFor now a more melancholy and a more lovely object lay motionless\r\nbefore them. This was no other than the charming Sophia herself, who,\r\nfrom the sight of blood, or from fear for her father, or from some\r\nother reason, had fallen down in a swoon, before any one could get to\r\nher assistance.\r\n\r\nMrs Western first saw her and screamed. Immediately two or three\r\nvoices cried out, “Miss Western is dead.” Hartshorn, water, every\r\nremedy was called for, almost at one and the same instant.\r\n\r\nThe reader may remember, that in our description of this grove we\r\nmentioned a murmuring brook, which brook did not come there, as such\r\ngentle streams flow through vulgar romances, with no other purpose\r\nthan to murmur. No! Fortune had decreed to ennoble this little brook\r\nwith a higher honour than any of those which wash the plains of\r\nArcadia ever deserved.\r\n\r\nJones was rubbing Blifil's temples, for he began to fear he had given\r\nhim a blow too much, when the words, Miss Western and Dead, rushed at\r\nonce on his ear. He started up, left Blifil to his fate, and flew to\r\nSophia, whom, while all the rest were running against each other,\r\nbackward and forward, looking for water in the dry paths, he caught up\r\nin his arms, and then ran away with her over the field to the rivulet\r\nabove mentioned; where, plunging himself into the water, he contrived\r\nto besprinkle her face, head, and neck very plentifully.\r\n\r\nHappy was it for Sophia that the same confusion which prevented her\r\nother friends from serving her, prevented them likewise from\r\nobstructing Jones. He had carried her half ways before they knew what\r\nhe was doing, and he had actually restored her to life before they\r\nreached the waterside. She stretched out her arms, opened her eyes,\r\nand cried, “Oh! heavens!” just as her father, aunt, and the parson\r\ncame up.\r\n\r\nJones, who had hitherto held this lovely burthen in his arms, now\r\nrelinquished his hold; but gave her at the same instant a tender\r\ncaress, which, had her senses been then perfectly restored, could not\r\nhave escaped her observation. As she expressed, therefore, no\r\ndispleasure at this freedom, we suppose she was not sufficiently\r\nrecovered from her swoon at the time.\r\n\r\nThis tragical scene was now converted into a sudden scene of joy. In\r\nthis our heroe was certainly the principal character; for as he\r\nprobably felt more ecstatic delight in having saved Sophia than she\r\nherself received from being saved, so neither were the congratulations\r\npaid to her equal to what were conferred on Jones, especially by Mr\r\nWestern himself, who, after having once or twice embraced his\r\ndaughter, fell to hugging and kissing Jones. He called him the\r\npreserver of Sophia, and declared there was nothing, except her, or\r\nhis estate, which he would not give him; but upon recollection, he\r\nafterwards excepted his fox-hounds, the Chevalier, and Miss Slouch\r\n(for so he called his favourite mare).\r\n\r\nAll fears for Sophia being now removed, Jones became the object of the\r\nsquire's consideration.--“Come, my lad,” says Western, “d'off thy\r\nquoat and wash thy feace; for att in a devilish pickle, I promise\r\nthee. Come, come, wash thyself, and shat go huome with me; and we'l\r\nzee to vind thee another quoat.”\r\n\r\nJones immediately complied, threw off his coat, went down to the\r\nwater, and washed both his face and bosom; for the latter was as much\r\nexposed and as bloody as the former. But though the water could clear\r\noff the blood, it could not remove the black and blue marks which\r\nThwackum had imprinted on both his face and breast, and which, being\r\ndiscerned by Sophia, drew from her a sigh and a look full of\r\ninexpressible tenderness.\r\n\r\nJones received this full in his eyes, and it had infinitely a stronger\r\neffect on him than all the contusions which he had received before. An\r\neffect, however, widely different; for so soft and balmy was it, that,\r\nhad all his former blows been stabs, it would for some minutes have\r\nprevented his feeling their smart.\r\n\r\nThe company now moved backwards, and soon arrived where Thwackum had\r\ngot Mr Blifil again on his legs. Here we cannot suppress a pious wish,\r\nthat all quarrels were to be decided by those weapons only with which\r\nNature, knowing what is proper for us, hath supplied us; and that cold\r\niron was to be used in digging no bowels but those of the earth. Then\r\nwould war, the pastime of monarchs, be almost inoffensive, and battles\r\nbetween great armies might be fought at the particular desire of\r\nseveral ladies of quality; who, together with the kings themselves,\r\nmight be actual spectators of the conflict. Then might the field be\r\nthis moment well strewed with human carcasses, and the next, the dead\r\nmen, or infinitely the greatest part of them, might get up, like Mr\r\nBayes's troops, and march off either at the sound of a drum or fiddle,\r\nas should be previously agreed on.\r\n\r\nI would avoid, if possible, treating this matter ludicrously, lest\r\ngrave men and politicians, whom I know to be offended at a jest, may\r\ncry pish at it; but, in reality, might not a battle be as well decided\r\nby the greater number of broken heads, bloody noses, and black eyes,\r\nas by the greater heaps of mangled and murdered human bodies? Might\r\nnot towns be contended for in the same manner? Indeed, this may be\r\nthought too detrimental a scheme to the French interest, since they\r\nwould thus lose the advantage they have over other nations in the\r\nsuperiority of their engineers; but when I consider the gallantry and\r\ngenerosity of that people, I am persuaded they would never decline\r\nputting themselves upon a par with their adversary; or, as the phrase\r\nis, making themselves his match.\r\n\r\nBut such reformations are rather to be wished than hoped for: I shall\r\ncontent myself, therefore, with this short hint, and return to my\r\nnarrative.\r\n\r\nWestern began now to inquire into the original rise of this quarrel.\r\nTo which neither Blifil nor Jones gave any answer; but Thwackum said\r\nsurlily, “I believe the cause is not far off; if you beat the bushes\r\nwell you may find her.”--“Find her?” replied Western: “what! have you\r\nbeen fighting for a wench?”--“Ask the gentleman in his waistcoat\r\nthere,” said Thwackum: “he best knows.” “Nay then,” cries Western, “it\r\nis a wench certainly.--Ah, Tom, Tom, thou art a liquorish dog. But\r\ncome, gentlemen, be all friends, and go home with me, and make final\r\npeace over a bottle.” “I ask your pardon, sir,” says Thwackum: “it is\r\nno such slight matter for a man of my character to be thus injuriously\r\ntreated, and buffeted by a boy, only because I would have done my\r\nduty, in endeavouring to detect and bring to justice a wanton harlot;\r\nbut, indeed, the principal fault lies in Mr Allworthy and yourself;\r\nfor if you put the laws in execution, as you ought to do, you will\r\nsoon rid the country of these vermin.”\r\n\r\n“I would as soon rid the country of foxes,” cries Western. “I think we\r\nought to encourage the recruiting those numbers which we are every day\r\nlosing in the war.--But where is she? Prithee, Tom, show me.” He then\r\nbegan to beat about, in the same language and in the same manner as if\r\nhe had been beating for a hare; and at last cried out, “Soho! Puss is\r\nnot far off. Here's her form, upon my soul; I believe I may cry stole\r\naway.” And indeed so he might; for he had now discovered the place\r\nwhence the poor girl had, at the beginning of the fray, stolen away,\r\nupon as many feet as a hare generally uses in travelling.\r\n\r\nSophia now desired her father to return home; saying she found herself\r\nvery faint, and apprehended a relapse. The squire immediately complied\r\nwith his daughter's request (for he was the fondest of parents). He\r\nearnestly endeavoured to prevail with the whole company to go and sup\r\nwith him: but Blifil and Thwackum absolutely refused; the former\r\nsaying, there were more reasons than he could then mention, why he\r\nmust decline this honour; and the latter declaring (perhaps rightly)\r\nthat it was not proper for a person of his function to be seen at any\r\nplace in his present condition.\r\n\r\nJones was incapable of refusing the pleasure of being with his Sophia;\r\nso on he marched with Squire Western and his ladies, the parson\r\nbringing up the rear. This had, indeed, offered to tarry with his\r\nbrother Thwackum, professing his regard for the cloth would not permit\r\nhim to depart; but Thwackum would not accept the favour, and, with no\r\ngreat civility, pushed him after Mr Western.\r\n\r\nThus ended this bloody fray; and thus shall end the fifth book of this\r\nhistory.\r\n\nBOOK VI.\r\n\r\nCONTAINING ABOUT THREE WEEKS."

      "content": "Of love.\r\n\nIn our last book we have been obliged to deal pretty much with the\r\npassion of love; and in our succeeding book shall be forced to handle\r\nthis subject still more largely. It may not therefore in this place be\r\nimproper to apply ourselves to the examination of that modern\r\ndoctrine, by which certain philosophers, among many other wonderful\r\ndiscoveries, pretend to have found out, that there is no such passion\r\nin the human breast.\r\n\r\nWhether these philosophers be the same with that surprising sect, who\r\nare honourably mentioned by the late Dr Swift, as having, by the mere\r\nforce of genius alone, without the least assistance of any kind of\r\nlearning, or even reading, discovered that profound and invaluable\r\nsecret that there is no God; or whether they are not rather the same\r\nwith those who some years since very much alarmed the world, by\r\nshowing that there were no such things as virtue or goodness really\r\nexisting in human nature, and who deduced our best actions from pride,\r\nI will not here presume to determine. In reality, I am inclined to\r\nsuspect, that all these several finders of truth, are the very\r\nidentical men who are by others called the finders of gold. The method\r\nused in both these searches after truth and after gold, being indeed\r\none and the same, viz., the searching, rummaging, and examining into a\r\nnasty place; indeed, in the former instances, into the nastiest of all\r\nplaces, A BAD MIND.\r\n\r\nBut though in this particular, and perhaps in their success, the\r\ntruth-finder and the gold-finder may very properly be compared\r\ntogether; yet in modesty, surely, there can be no comparison between\r\nthe two; for who ever heard of a gold-finder that had the impudence or\r\nfolly to assert, from the ill success of his search, that there was no\r\nsuch thing as gold in the world? whereas the truth-finder, having\r\nraked out that jakes, his own mind, and being there capable of tracing\r\nno ray of divinity, nor anything virtuous or good, or lovely, or\r\nloving, very fairly, honestly, and logically concludes that no such\r\nthings exist in the whole creation.\r\n\r\nTo avoid, however, all contention, if possible, with these\r\nphilosophers, if they will be called so; and to show our own\r\ndisposition to accommodate matters peaceably between us, we shall here\r\nmake them some concessions, which may possibly put an end to the\r\ndispute.\r\n\r\nFirst, we will grant that many minds, and perhaps those of the\r\nphilosophers, are entirely free from the least traces of such a\r\npassion.\r\n\r\nSecondly, that what is commonly called love, namely, the desire of\r\nsatisfying a voracious appetite with a certain quantity of delicate\r\nwhite human flesh, is by no means that passion for which I here\r\ncontend. This is indeed more properly hunger; and as no glutton is\r\nashamed to apply the word love to his appetite, and to say he LOVES\r\nsuch and such dishes; so may the lover of this kind, with equal\r\npropriety, say, he HUNGERS after such and such women.\r\n\r\nThirdly, I will grant, which I believe will be a most acceptable\r\nconcession, that this love for which I am an advocate, though it\r\nsatisfies itself in a much more delicate manner, doth nevertheless\r\nseek its own satisfaction as much as the grossest of all our\r\nappetites.\r\n\r\nAnd, lastly, that this love, when it operates towards one of a\r\ndifferent sex, is very apt, towards its complete gratification, to\r\ncall in the aid of that hunger which I have mentioned above; and which\r\nit is so far from abating, that it heightens all its delights to a\r\ndegree scarce imaginable by those who have never been susceptible of\r\nany other emotions than what have proceeded from appetite alone.\r\n\r\nIn return to all these concessions, I desire of the philosophers to\r\ngrant, that there is in some (I believe in many) human breasts a kind\r\nand benevolent disposition, which is gratified by contributing to the\r\nhappiness of others. That in this gratification alone, as in\r\nfriendship, in parental and filial affection, as indeed in general\r\nphilanthropy, there is a great and exquisite delight. That if we will\r\nnot call such disposition love, we have no name for it. That though\r\nthe pleasures arising from such pure love may be heightened and\r\nsweetened by the assistance of amorous desires, yet the former can\r\nsubsist alone, nor are they destroyed by the intervention of the\r\nlatter. Lastly, that esteem and gratitude are the proper motives to\r\nlove, as youth and beauty are to desire, and, therefore, though such\r\ndesire may naturally cease, when age or sickness overtakes its object;\r\nyet these can have no effect on love, nor ever shake or remove, from a\r\ngood mind, that sensation or passion which hath gratitude and esteem\r\nfor its basis.\r\n\r\nTo deny the existence of a passion of which we often see manifest\r\ninstances, seems to be very strange and absurd; and can indeed proceed\r\nonly from that self-admonition which we have mentioned above: but how\r\nunfair is this! Doth the man who recognizes in his own heart no traces\r\nof avarice or ambition, conclude, therefore, that there are no such\r\npassions in human nature? Why will we not modestly observe the same\r\nrule in judging of the good, as well as the evil of others? Or why, in\r\nany case, will we, as Shakespear phrases it, “put the world in our own\r\nperson?”\r\n\r\nPredominant vanity is, I am afraid, too much concerned here. This is\r\none instance of that adulation which we bestow on our own minds, and\r\nthis almost universally. For there is scarce any man, how much soever\r\nhe may despise the character of a flatterer, but will condescend in\r\nthe meanest manner to flatter himself.\r\n\r\nTo those therefore I apply for the truth of the above observations,\r\nwhose own minds can bear testimony to what I have advanced.\r\n\r\nExamine your heart, my good reader, and resolve whether you do believe\r\nthese matters with me. If you do, you may now proceed to their\r\nexemplification in the following pages: if you do not, you have, I\r\nassure you, already read more than you have understood; and it would\r\nbe wiser to pursue your business, or your pleasures (such as they\r\nare), than to throw away any more of your time in reading what you can\r\nneither taste nor comprehend. To treat of the effects of love to you,\r\nmust be as absurd as to discourse on colours to a man born blind;\r\nsince possibly your idea of love may be as absurd as that which we are\r\ntold such blind man once entertained of the colour scarlet; that\r\ncolour seemed to him to be very much like the sound of a trumpet: and\r\nlove probably may, in your opinion, very greatly resemble a dish of\r\nsoup, or a surloin of roast-beef."

      "content": "The character of Mrs Western. Her great learning and knowledge of the\r\nworld, and an instance of the deep penetration which she derived from\r\nthose advantages.\r\n\nThe reader hath seen Mr Western, his sister, and daughter, with young\r\nJones, and the parson, going together to Mr Western's house, where the\r\ngreater part of the company spent the evening with much joy and\r\nfestivity. Sophia was indeed the only grave person; for as to Jones,\r\nthough love had now gotten entire possession of his heart, yet the\r\npleasing reflection on Mr Allworthy's recovery, and the presence of\r\nhis mistress, joined to some tender looks which she now and then could\r\nnot refrain from giving him, so elevated our heroe, that he joined the\r\nmirth of the other three, who were perhaps as good-humoured people as\r\nany in the world.\r\n\r\nSophia retained the same gravity of countenance the next morning at\r\nbreakfast; whence she retired likewise earlier than usual, leaving her\r\nfather and aunt together. The squire took no notice of this change in\r\nhis daughter's disposition. To say the truth, though he was somewhat\r\nof a politician, and had been twice a candidate in the country\r\ninterest at an election, he was a man of no great observation. His\r\nsister was a lady of a different turn. She had lived about the court,\r\nand had seen the world. Hence she had acquired all that knowledge\r\nwhich the said world usually communicates; and was a perfect mistress\r\nof manners, customs, ceremonies, and fashions. Nor did her erudition\r\nstop here. She had considerably improved her mind by study; she had\r\nnot only read all the modern plays, operas, oratorios, poems, and\r\nromances--in all which she was a critic; but had gone through Rapin's\r\nHistory of England, Eachard's Roman History, and many French _Mémoires\r\npour servir à l'Histoire_: to these she had added most of the\r\npolitical pamphlets and journals published within the last twenty\r\nyears. From which she had attained a very competent skill in politics,\r\nand could discourse very learnedly on the affairs of Europe. She was,\r\nmoreover, excellently well skilled in the doctrine of amour, and knew\r\nbetter than anybody who and who were together; a knowledge which she\r\nthe more easily attained, as her pursuit of it was never diverted by\r\nany affairs of her own; for either she had no inclinations, or they\r\nhad never been solicited; which last is indeed very probable; for her\r\nmasculine person, which was near six foot high, added to her manner\r\nand learning, possibly prevented the other sex from regarding her,\r\nnotwithstanding her petticoats, in the light of a woman. However, as\r\nshe had considered the matter scientifically, she perfectly well knew,\r\nthough she had never practised them, all the arts which fine ladies\r\nuse when they desire to give encouragement, or to conceal liking, with\r\nall the long appendage of smiles, ogles, glances, &c., as they are at\r\npresent practised in the beau-monde. To sum the whole, no species of\r\ndisguise or affectation had escaped her notice; but as to the plain\r\nsimple workings of honest nature, as she had never seen any such, she\r\ncould know but little of them.\r\n\r\nBy means of this wonderful sagacity, Mrs Western had now, as she\r\nthought, made a discovery of something in the mind of Sophia. The\r\nfirst hint of this she took from the behaviour of the young lady in\r\nthe field of battle; and the suspicion which she then conceived, was\r\ngreatly corroborated by some observations which she had made that\r\nevening and the next morning. However, being greatly cautious to avoid\r\nbeing found in a mistake, she carried the secret a whole fortnight in\r\nher bosom, giving only some oblique hints, by simpering, winks, nods,\r\nand now and then dropping an obscure word, which indeed sufficiently\r\nalarmed Sophia, but did not at all affect her brother.\r\n\r\nBeing at length, however, thoroughly satisfied of the truth of her\r\nobservation, she took an opportunity, one morning, when she was alone\r\nwith her brother, to interrupt one of his whistles in the following\r\nmanner:--\r\n\r\n“Pray, brother, have you not observed something very extraordinary in my\r\nniece lately?”--“No, not I,” answered Western; “is anything the matter\r\nwith the girl?”--“I think there is,” replied she; “and something of\r\nmuch consequence too.”--“Why, she doth not complain of anything,”\r\n cries Western; “and she hath had the small-pox.”--“Brother,” returned\r\nshe, “girls are liable to other distempers besides the small-pox, and\r\nsometimes possibly to much worse.” Here Western interrupted her with\r\nmuch earnestness, and begged her, if anything ailed his daughter, to\r\nacquaint him immediately; adding, “she knew he loved her more than his\r\nown soul, and that he would send to the world's end for the best\r\nphysician to her.” “Nay, nay,” answered she, smiling, “the distemper\r\nis not so terrible; but I believe, brother, you are convinced I know\r\nthe world, and I promise you I was never more deceived in my life, if\r\nmy niece be not most desperately in love.”--“How! in love!” cries\r\nWestern, in a passion; “in love, without acquainting me! I'll\r\ndisinherit her; I'll turn her out of doors, stark naked, without a\r\nfarthing. Is all my kindness vor 'ur, and vondness o'ur come to this,\r\nto fall in love without asking me leave?”--“But you will not,”\r\n answered Mrs Western, “turn this daughter, whom you love better than\r\nyour own soul, out of doors, before you know whether you shall approve\r\nher choice. Suppose she should have fixed on the very person whom you\r\nyourself would wish, I hope you would not be angry then?”--“No, no,”\r\n cries Western, “that would make a difference. If she marries the man I\r\nwould ha' her, she may love whom she pleases, I shan't trouble my head\r\nabout that.” “That is spoken,” answered the sister, “like a sensible\r\nman; but I believe the very person she hath chosen would be the very\r\nperson you would choose for her. I will disclaim all knowledge of the\r\nworld, if it is not so; and I believe, brother, you will allow I have\r\nsome.”--“Why, lookee, sister,” said Western, “I do believe you have as\r\nmuch as any woman; and to be sure those are women's matters. You know\r\nI don't love to hear you talk about politics; they belong to us, and\r\npetticoats should not meddle: but come, who is the man?”--“Marry!”\r\n said she, “you may find him out yourself if you please. You, who are\r\nso great a politician, can be at no great loss. The judgment which can\r\npenetrate into the cabinets of princes, and discover the secret\r\nsprings which move the great state wheels in all the political\r\nmachines of Europe, must surely, with very little difficulty, find out\r\nwhat passes in the rude uninformed mind of a girl.”--“Sister,” cries\r\nthe squire, “I have often warn'd you not to talk the court gibberish\r\nto me. I tell you, I don't understand the lingo: but I can read a\r\njournal, or the _London Evening Post._ Perhaps, indeed, there may be\r\nnow and tan a verse which I can't make much of, because half the\r\nletters are left out; yet I know very well what is meant by that, and\r\nthat our affairs don't go so well as they should do, because of\r\nbribery and corruption.”--“I pity your country ignorance from my\r\nheart,” cries the lady.--“Do you?” answered Western; “and I pity your\r\ntown learning; I had rather be anything than a courtier, and a\r\nPresbyterian, and a Hanoverian too, as some people, I believe,\r\nare.”--“If you mean me,” answered she, “you know I am a woman,\r\nbrother; and it signifies nothing what I am. Besides--“--“I do know\r\nyou are a woman,” cries the squire, “and it's well for thee that art\r\none; if hadst been a man, I promise thee I had lent thee a flick long\r\nago.”--“Ay, there,” said she, “in that flick lies all your fancied\r\nsuperiority. Your bodies, and not your brains, are stronger than ours.\r\nBelieve me, it is well for you that you are able to beat us; or, such\r\nis the superiority of our understanding, we should make all of you\r\nwhat the brave, and wise, and witty, and polite are already--our\r\nslaves.”--“I am glad I know your mind,” answered the squire. “But\r\nwe'll talk more of this matter another time. At present, do tell me\r\nwhat man is it you mean about my daughter?”--“Hold a moment,” said\r\nshe, “while I digest that sovereign contempt I have for your sex; or\r\nelse I ought to be angry too with you. There--I have made a shift to\r\ngulp it down. And now, good politic sir, what think you of Mr Blifil?\r\nDid she not faint away on seeing him lie breathless on the ground? Did\r\nshe not, after he was recovered, turn pale again the moment we came up\r\nto that part of the field where he stood? And pray what else should be\r\nthe occasion of all her melancholy that night at supper, the next\r\nmorning, and indeed ever since?”--“'Fore George!” cries the squire,\r\n“now you mind me on't, I remember it all. It is certainly so, and I am\r\nglad on't with all my heart. I knew Sophy was a good girl, and would\r\nnot fall in love to make me angry. I was never more rejoiced in my\r\nlife; for nothing can lie so handy together as our two estates. I had\r\nthis matter in my head some time ago: for certainly the two estates\r\nare in a manner joined together in matrimony already, and it would be\r\na thousand pities to part them. It is true, indeed, there be larger\r\nestates in the kingdom, but not in this county, and I had rather bate\r\nsomething, than marry my daughter among strangers and foreigners.\r\nBesides, most o' zuch great estates be in the hands of lords, and I\r\nheate the very name of _themmun_. Well but, sister, what would you\r\nadvise me to do; for I tell you women know these matters better than\r\nwe do?”--“Oh, your humble servant, sir,” answered the lady: “we are\r\nobliged to you for allowing us a capacity in anything. Since you are\r\npleased, then, most politic sir, to ask my advice, I think you may\r\npropose the match to Allworthy yourself. There is no indecorum in the\r\nproposal's coming from the parent of either side. King Alcinous, in Mr\r\nPope's Odyssey, offers his daughter to Ulysses. I need not caution so\r\npolitic a person not to say that your daughter is in love; that would\r\nindeed be against all rules.”--“Well,” said the squire, “I will\r\npropose it; but I shall certainly lend un a flick, if he should refuse\r\nme.” “Fear not,” cries Mrs Western; “the match is too advantageous to\r\nbe refused.” “I don't know that,” answered the squire: “Allworthy is a\r\nqueer b--ch, and money hath no effect o'un.” “Brother,” said the lady,\r\n“your politics astonish me. Are you really to be imposed on by\r\nprofessions? Do you think Mr Allworthy hath more contempt for money\r\nthan other men because he professes more? Such credulity would better\r\nbecome one of us weak women, than that wise sex which heaven hath\r\nformed for politicians. Indeed, brother, you would make a fine plenipo\r\nto negotiate with the French. They would soon persuade you, that they\r\ntake towns out of mere defensive principles.” “Sister,” answered the\r\nsquire, with much scorn, “let your friends at court answer for the\r\ntowns taken; as you are a woman, I shall lay no blame upon you; for I\r\nsuppose they are wiser than to trust women with secrets.” He\r\naccompanied this with so sarcastical a laugh, that Mrs Western could\r\nbear no longer. She had been all this time fretted in a tender part\r\n(for she was indeed very deeply skilled in these matters, and very\r\nviolent in them), and therefore, burst forth in a rage, declared her\r\nbrother to be both a clown and a blockhead, and that she would stay no\r\nlonger in his house.\r\n\r\nThe squire, though perhaps he had never read Machiavel, was, however,\r\nin many points, a perfect politician. He strongly held all those wise\r\ntenets, which are so well inculcated in that Politico-Peripatetic\r\nschool of Exchange-alley. He knew the just value and only use of\r\nmoney, viz., to lay it up. He was likewise well skilled in the exact\r\nvalue of reversions, expectations, &c., and had often considered the\r\namount of his sister's fortune, and the chance which he or his\r\nposterity had of inheriting it. This he was infinitely too wise to\r\nsacrifice to a trifling resentment. When he found, therefore, he had\r\ncarried matters too far, he began to think of reconciling them; which\r\nwas no very difficult task, as the lady had great affection for her\r\nbrother, and still greater for her niece; and though too susceptible\r\nof an affront offered to her skill in politics, on which she much\r\nvalued herself, was a woman of a very extraordinary good and sweet\r\ndisposition.\r\n\r\nHaving first, therefore, laid violent hands on the horses, for whose\r\nescape from the stable no place but the window was left open, he next\r\napplied himself to his sister; softened and soothed her, by unsaying\r\nall he had said, and by assertions directly contrary to those which\r\nhad incensed her. Lastly, he summoned the eloquence of Sophia to his\r\nassistance, who, besides a most graceful and winning address, had the\r\nadvantage of being heard with great favour and partiality by her aunt.\r\n\r\nThe result of the whole was a kind smile from Mrs Western, who said,\r\n“Brother, you are absolutely a perfect Croat; but as those have their\r\nuse in the army of the empress queen, so you likewise have some good\r\nin you. I will therefore once more sign a treaty of peace with you,\r\nand see that you do not infringe it on your side; at least, as you are\r\nso excellent a politician, I may expect you will keep your leagues,\r\nlike the French, till your interest calls upon you to break them.”"

      "content": "Containing two defiances to the critics.\r\n\nThe squire having settled matters with his sister, as we have seen in\r\nthe last chapter, was so greatly impatient to communicate the proposal\r\nto Allworthy, that Mrs Western had the utmost difficulty to prevent\r\nhim from visiting that gentleman in his sickness, for this purpose.\r\n\r\nMr Allworthy had been engaged to dine with Mr Western at the time when\r\nhe was taken ill. He was therefore no sooner discharged out of the\r\ncustody of physic, but he thought (as was usual with him on all\r\noccasions, both the highest and the lowest) of fulfilling his\r\nengagement.\r\n\r\nIn the interval between the time of the dialogue in the last chapter,\r\nand this day of public entertainment, Sophia had, from certain obscure\r\nhints thrown out by her aunt, collected some apprehension that the\r\nsagacious lady suspected her passion for Jones. She now resolved to\r\ntake this opportunity of wiping out all such suspicion, and for that\r\npurpose to put an entire constraint on her behaviour.\r\n\r\nFirst, she endeavoured to conceal a throbbing melancholy heart with\r\nthe utmost sprightliness in her countenance, and the highest gaiety in\r\nher manner. Secondly, she addressed her whole discourse to Mr Blifil,\r\nand took not the least notice of poor Jones the whole day.\r\n\r\nThe squire was so delighted with this conduct of his daughter, that he\r\nscarce eat any dinner, and spent almost his whole time in watching\r\nopportunities of conveying signs of his approbation by winks and nods\r\nto his sister; who was not at first altogether so pleased with what\r\nshe saw as was her brother.\r\n\r\nIn short, Sophia so greatly overacted her part, that her aunt was at\r\nfirst staggered, and began to suspect some affectation in her niece;\r\nbut as she was herself a woman of great art, so she soon attributed\r\nthis to extreme art in Sophia. She remembered the many hints she had\r\ngiven her niece concerning her being in love, and imagined the young\r\nlady had taken this way to rally her out of her opinion, by an\r\noveracted civility: a notion that was greatly corroborated by the\r\nexcessive gaiety with which the whole was accompanied. We cannot here\r\navoid remarking, that this conjecture would have been better founded\r\nhad Sophia lived ten years in the air of Grosvenor Square, where young\r\nladies do learn a wonderful knack of rallying and playing with that\r\npassion, which is a mighty serious thing in woods and groves an\r\nhundred miles distant from London.\r\n\r\nTo say the truth, in discovering the deceit of others, it matters much\r\nthat our own art be wound up, if I may use the expression, in the same\r\nkey with theirs: for very artful men sometimes miscarry by fancying\r\nothers wiser, or, in other words, greater knaves, than they really\r\nare. As this observation is pretty deep, I will illustrate it by the\r\nfollowing short story. Three countrymen were pursuing a Wiltshire\r\nthief through Brentford. The simplest of them seeing “The Wiltshire\r\nHouse,” written under a sign, advised his companions to enter it, for\r\nthere most probably they would find their countryman. The second, who\r\nwas wiser, laughed at this simplicity; but the third, who was wiser\r\nstill, answered, “Let us go in, however, for he may think we should\r\nnot suspect him of going amongst his own countrymen.” They accordingly\r\nwent in and searched the house, and by that means missed overtaking\r\nthe thief, who was at that time but a little way before them; and who,\r\nas they all knew, but had never once reflected, could not read.\r\n\r\nThe reader will pardon a digression in which so invaluable a secret is\r\ncommunicated, since every gamester will agree how necessary it is to\r\nknow exactly the play of another, in order to countermine him. This\r\nwill, moreover, afford a reason why the wiser man, as is often seen,\r\nis the bubble of the weaker, and why many simple and innocent\r\ncharacters are so generally misunderstood and misrepresented; but what\r\nis most material, this will account for the deceit which Sophia put on\r\nher politic aunt.\r\n\r\nDinner being ended, and the company retired into the garden, Mr\r\nWestern, who was thoroughly convinced of the certainty of what his\r\nsister had told him, took Mr Allworthy aside, and very bluntly\r\nproposed a match between Sophia and young Mr Blifil.\r\n\r\nMr Allworthy was not one of those men whose hearts flutter at any\r\nunexpected and sudden tidings of worldly profit. His mind was, indeed,\r\ntempered with that philosophy which becomes a man and a Christian. He\r\naffected no absolute superiority to all pleasure and pain, to all joy\r\nand grief; but was not at the same time to be discomposed and ruffled\r\nby every accidental blast, by every smile or frown of fortune. He\r\nreceived, therefore, Mr Western's proposal without any visible\r\nemotion, or without any alteration of countenance. He said the\r\nalliance was such as he sincerely wished; then launched forth into a\r\nvery just encomium on the young lady's merit; acknowledged the offer\r\nto be advantageous in point of fortune; and after thanking Mr Western\r\nfor the good opinion he had professed of his nephew, concluded, that\r\nif the young people liked each other, he should be very desirous to\r\ncomplete the affair.\r\n\r\nWestern was a little disappointed at Mr Allworthy's answer, which was\r\nnot so warm as he expected. He treated the doubt whether the young\r\npeople might like one another with great contempt, saying, “That\r\nparents were the best judges of proper matches for their children:\r\nthat for his part he should insist on the most resigned obedience from\r\nhis daughter: and if any young fellow could refuse such a bed-fellow,\r\nhe was his humble servant, and hoped there was no harm done.”\r\n\r\nAllworthy endeavoured to soften this resentment by many eulogiums on\r\nSophia, declaring he had no doubt but that Mr Blifil would very gladly\r\nreceive the offer; but all was ineffectual; he could obtain no other\r\nanswer from the squire but--“I say no more--I humbly hope there's no\r\nharm done--that's all.” Which words he repeated at least a hundred\r\ntimes before they parted.\r\n\r\nAllworthy was too well acquainted with his neighbour to be offended at\r\nthis behaviour; and though he was so averse to the rigour which some\r\nparents exercise on their children in the article of marriage, that he\r\nhad resolved never to force his nephew's inclinations, he was\r\nnevertheless much pleased with the prospect of this union; for the\r\nwhole country resounded the praises of Sophia, and he had himself\r\ngreatly admired the uncommon endowments of both her mind and person.\r\n\r\nTo which I believe we may add, the consideration of her vast fortune,\r\nwhich, though he was too sober to be intoxicated with it, he was too\r\nsensible to despise.\r\n\r\nAnd here, in defiance of all the barking critics in the world, I must\r\nand will introduce a digression concerning true wisdom, of which Mr\r\nAllworthy was in reality as great a pattern as he was of goodness.\r\n\r\nTrue wisdom then, notwithstanding all which Mr Hogarth's poor poet may\r\nhave writ against riches, and in spite of all which any rich well-fed\r\ndivine may have preached against pleasure, consists not in the\r\ncontempt of either of these. A man may have as much wisdom in the\r\npossession of an affluent fortune, as any beggar in the streets; or\r\nmay enjoy a handsome wife or a hearty friend, and still remain as wise\r\nas any sour popish recluse, who buries all his social faculties, and\r\nstarves his belly while he well lashes his back.\r\n\r\nTo say truth, the wisest man is the likeliest to possess all worldly\r\nblessings in an eminent degree; for as that moderation which wisdom\r\nprescribes is the surest way to useful wealth, so can it alone qualify\r\nus to taste many pleasures. The wise man gratifies every appetite and\r\nevery passion, while the fool sacrifices all the rest to pall and\r\nsatiate one.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected, that very wise men have been notoriously\r\navaricious. I answer, Not wise in that instance. It may likewise be\r\nsaid, That the wisest men have been in their youth immoderately fond\r\nof pleasure. I answer, They were not wise then.\r\n\r\nWisdom, in short, whose lessons have been represented as so hard to\r\nlearn by those who never were at her school, only teaches us to extend\r\na simple maxim universally known and followed even in the lowest life,\r\na little farther than that life carries it. And this is, not to buy at\r\ntoo dear a price.\r\n\r\nNow, whoever takes this maxim abroad with him into the grand market of\r\nthe world, and constantly applies it to honours, to riches, to\r\npleasures, and to every other commodity which that market affords, is,\r\nI will venture to affirm, a wise man, and must be so acknowledged in\r\nthe worldly sense of the word; for he makes the best of bargains,\r\nsince in reality he purchases everything at the price only of a little\r\ntrouble, and carries home all the good things I have mentioned, while\r\nhe keeps his health, his innocence, and his reputation, the common\r\nprices which are paid for them by others, entire and to himself.\r\n\r\nFrom this moderation, likewise, he learns two other lessons, which\r\ncomplete his character. First, never to be intoxicated when he hath\r\nmade the best bargain, nor dejected when the market is empty, or when\r\nits commodities are too dear for his purchase.\r\n\r\nBut I must remember on what subject I am writing, and not trespass too\r\nfar on the patience of a good-natured critic. Here, therefore, I put\r\nan end to the chapter."

      "content": "Containing sundry curious matters.\r\n\nAs soon as Mr Allworthy returned home, he took Mr Blifil apart, and\r\nafter some preface, communicated to him the proposal which had been\r\nmade by Mr Western, and at the same time informed him how agreeable\r\nthis match would be to himself.\r\n\r\nThe charms of Sophia had not made the least impression on Blifil; not\r\nthat his heart was pre-engaged; neither was he totally insensible of\r\nbeauty, or had any aversion to women; but his appetites were by nature\r\nso moderate, that he was able, by philosophy, or by study, or by some\r\nother method, easily to subdue them: and as to that passion which we\r\nhave treated of in the first chapter of this book, he had not the\r\nleast tincture of it in his whole composition.\r\n\r\nBut though he was so entirely free from that mixed passion, of which\r\nwe there treated, and of which the virtues and beauty of Sophia formed\r\nso notable an object; yet was he altogether as well furnished with\r\nsome other passions, that promised themselves very full gratification\r\nin the young lady's fortune. Such were avarice and ambition, which\r\ndivided the dominion of his mind between them. He had more than once\r\nconsidered the possession of this fortune as a very desirable thing,\r\nand had entertained some distant views concerning it; but his own\r\nyouth, and that of the young lady, and indeed principally a reflection\r\nthat Mr Western might marry again, and have more children, had\r\nrestrained him from too hasty or eager a pursuit.\r\n\r\nThis last and most material objection was now in great measure\r\nremoved, as the proposal came from Mr Western himself. Blifil,\r\ntherefore, after a very short hesitation, answered Mr Allworthy, that\r\nmatrimony was a subject on which he had not yet thought; but that he\r\nwas so sensible of his friendly and fatherly care, that he should in\r\nall things submit himself to his pleasure.\r\n\r\nAllworthy was naturally a man of spirit, and his present gravity arose\r\nfrom true wisdom and philosophy, not from any original phlegm in his\r\ndisposition; for he had possessed much fire in his youth, and had\r\nmarried a beautiful woman for love. He was not therefore greatly\r\npleased with this cold answer of his nephew; nor could he help\r\nlaunching forth into the praises of Sophia, and expressing some wonder\r\nthat the heart of a young man could be impregnable to the force of\r\nsuch charms, unless it was guarded by some prior affection.\r\n\r\nBlifil assured him he had no such guard; and then proceeded to\r\ndiscourse so wisely and religiously on love and marriage, that he\r\nwould have stopt the mouth of a parent much less devoutly inclined\r\nthan was his uncle. In the end, the good man was satisfied that his\r\nnephew, far from having any objections to Sophia, had that esteem for\r\nher, which in sober and virtuous minds is the sure foundation of\r\nfriendship and love. And as he doubted not but the lover would, in a\r\nlittle time, become altogether as agreeable to his mistress, he\r\nforesaw great happiness arising to all parties by so proper and\r\ndesirable an union. With Mr Blifil's consent therefore he wrote the\r\nnext morning to Mr Western, acquainting him that his nephew had very\r\nthankfully and gladly received the proposal, and would be ready to\r\nwait on the young lady, whenever she should be pleased to accept his\r\nvisit.\r\n\r\nWestern was much pleased with this letter, and immediately returned an\r\nanswer; in which, without having mentioned a word to his daughter, he\r\nappointed that very afternoon for opening the scene of courtship.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had dispatched this messenger, he went in quest of his\r\nsister, whom he found reading and expounding the _Gazette_ to parson\r\nSupple. To this exposition he was obliged to attend near a quarter of\r\nan hour, though with great violence to his natural impetuosity, before\r\nhe was suffered to speak. At length, however, he found an opportunity\r\nof acquainting the lady, that he had business of great consequence to\r\nimpart to her; to which she answered, “Brother, I am entirely at your\r\nservice. Things look so well in the north, that I was never in a\r\nbetter humour.”\r\n\r\nThe parson then withdrawing, Western acquainted her with all which had\r\npassed, and desired her to communicate the affair to Sophia, which she\r\nreadily and chearfully undertook; though perhaps her brother was a\r\nlittle obliged to that agreeable northern aspect which had so\r\ndelighted her, that he heard no comment on his proceedings; for they\r\nwere certainly somewhat too hasty and violent."

      "content": "In which is related what passed between Sophia and her aunt.\r\n\nSophia was in her chamber, reading, when her aunt came in. The moment\r\nshe saw Mrs Western, she shut the book with so much eagerness, that\r\nthe good lady could not forbear asking her, What book that was which\r\nshe seemed so much afraid of showing? “Upon my word, madam,” answered\r\nSophia, “it is a book which I am neither ashamed nor afraid to own I\r\nhave read. It is the production of a young lady of fashion, whose good\r\nunderstanding, I think, doth honour to her sex, and whose good heart\r\nis an honour to human nature.” Mrs Western then took up the book, and\r\nimmediately after threw it down, saying--“Yes, the author is of a very\r\ngood family; but she is not much among people one knows. I have never\r\nread it; for the best judges say, there is not much in it.”--“I dare\r\nnot, madam, set up my own opinion,” says Sophia, “against the best\r\njudges, but there appears to me a great deal of human nature in it;\r\nand in many parts so much true tenderness and delicacy, that it hath\r\ncost me many a tear.”--“Ay, and do you love to cry then?” says the\r\naunt. “I love a tender sensation,” answered the niece, “and would pay\r\nthe price of a tear for it at any time.”--“Well, but show me,” said\r\nthe aunt, “what was you reading when I came in; there was something\r\nvery tender in that, I believe, and very loving too. You blush, my\r\ndear Sophia. Ah! child, you should read books which would teach you a\r\nlittle hypocrisy, which would instruct you how to hide your thoughts a\r\nlittle better.”--“I hope, madam,” answered Sophia, “I have no thoughts\r\nwhich I ought to be ashamed of discovering.”--“Ashamed! no,” cries the\r\naunt, “I don't think you have any thoughts which you ought to be\r\nashamed of; and yet, child, you blushed just now when I mentioned the\r\nword loving. Dear Sophy, be assured you have not one thought which I\r\nam not well acquainted with; as well, child, as the French are with\r\nour motions, long before we put them in execution. Did you think,\r\nchild, because you have been able to impose upon your father, that you\r\ncould impose upon me? Do you imagine I did not know the reason of your\r\noveracting all that friendship for Mr Blifil yesterday? I have seen a\r\nlittle too much of the world, to be so deceived. Nay, nay, do not\r\nblush again. I tell you it is a passion you need not be ashamed of. It\r\nis a passion I myself approve, and have already brought your father\r\ninto the approbation of it. Indeed, I solely consider your\r\ninclination; for I would always have that gratified, if possible,\r\nthough one may sacrifice higher prospects. Come, I have news which\r\nwill delight your very soul. Make me your confident, and I will\r\nundertake you shall be happy to the very extent of your wishes.” “La,\r\nmadam,” says Sophia, looking more foolishly than ever she did in her\r\nlife, “I know not what to say--why, madam, should you suspect?”--“Nay,\r\nno dishonesty,” returned Mrs Western. “Consider, you are speaking to\r\none of your own sex, to an aunt, and I hope you are convinced you\r\nspeak to a friend. Consider, you are only revealing to me what I know\r\nalready, and what I plainly saw yesterday, through that most artful of\r\nall disguises, which you had put on, and which must have deceived any\r\none who had not perfectly known the world. Lastly, consider it is a\r\npassion which I highly approve.” “La, madam,” says Sophia, “you come\r\nupon one so unawares, and on a sudden. To be sure, madam, I am not\r\nblind--and certainly, if it be a fault to see all human perfections\r\nassembled together--but is it possible my father and you, madam, can\r\nsee with my eyes?” “I tell you,” answered the aunt, “we do entirely\r\napprove; and this very afternoon your father hath appointed for you to\r\nreceive your lover.” “My father, this afternoon!” cries Sophia, with\r\nthe blood starting from her face.--“Yes, child,” said the aunt, “this\r\nafternoon. You know the impetuosity of my brother's temper. I\r\nacquainted him with the passion which I first discovered in you that\r\nevening when you fainted away in the field. I saw it in your fainting.\r\nI saw it immediately upon your recovery. I saw it that evening at\r\nsupper, and the next morning at breakfast (you know, child, I have\r\nseen the world). Well, I no sooner acquainted my brother, but he\r\nimmediately wanted to propose it to Allworthy. He proposed it\r\nyesterday, Allworthy consented (as to be sure he must with joy), and\r\nthis afternoon, I tell you, you are to put on all your best airs.”\r\n “This afternoon!” cries Sophia. “Dear aunt, you frighten me out of my\r\nsenses.” “O, my dear,” said the aunt, “you will soon come to yourself\r\nagain; for he is a charming young fellow, that's the truth on't.”\r\n “Nay, I will own,” says Sophia, “I know none with such perfections. So\r\nbrave, and yet so gentle; so witty, yet so inoffensive; so humane, so\r\ncivil, so genteel, so handsome! What signifies his being base born,\r\nwhen compared with such qualifications as these?” “Base born? What do\r\nyou mean?” said the aunt, “Mr Blifil base born!” Sophia turned\r\ninstantly pale at this name, and faintly repeated it. Upon which the\r\naunt cried, “Mr Blifil--ay, Mr Blifil, of whom else have we been\r\ntalking?” “Good heavens,” answered Sophia, ready to sink, “of Mr\r\nJones, I thought; I am sure I know no other who deserves--” “I\r\nprotest,” cries the aunt, “you frighten me in your turn. Is it Mr\r\nJones, and not Mr Blifil, who is the object of your affection?” “Mr\r\nBlifil!” repeated Sophia. “Sure it is impossible you can be in\r\nearnest; if you are, I am the most miserable woman alive.” Mrs Western\r\nnow stood a few moments silent, while sparks of fiery rage flashed\r\nfrom her eyes. At length, collecting all her force of voice, she\r\nthundered forth in the following articulate sounds:\r\n\r\n“And is it possible you can think of disgracing your family by allying\r\nyourself to a bastard? Can the blood of the Westerns submit to such\r\ncontamination? If you have not sense sufficient to restrain such\r\nmonstrous inclinations, I thought the pride of our family would have\r\nprevented you from giving the least encouragement to so base an\r\naffection; much less did I imagine you would ever have had the\r\nassurance to own it to my face.”\r\n\r\n“Madam,” answered Sophia, trembling, “what I have said you have\r\nextorted from me. I do not remember to have ever mentioned the name of\r\nMr Jones with approbation to any one before; nor should I now had I\r\nnot conceived he had your approbation. Whatever were my thoughts of\r\nthat poor, unhappy young man, I intended to have carried them with me\r\nto my grave--to that grave where only now, I find, I am to seek\r\nrepose.” Here she sunk down in her chair, drowned in her tears, and,\r\nin all the moving silence of unutterable grief, presented a spectacle\r\nwhich must have affected almost the hardest heart.\r\n\r\nAll this tender sorrow, however, raised no compassion in her aunt. On\r\nthe contrary, she now fell into the most violent rage.--“And I would\r\nrather,” she cried, in a most vehement voice, “follow you to your\r\ngrave, than I would see you disgrace yourself and your family by such\r\na match. O Heavens! could I have ever suspected that I should live to\r\nhear a niece of mine declare a passion for such a fellow? You are the\r\nfirst--yes, Miss Western, you are the first of your name who ever\r\nentertained so grovelling a thought. A family so noted for the\r\nprudence of its women”--here she ran on a full quarter of an hour,\r\ntill, having exhausted her breath rather than her rage, she concluded\r\nwith threatening to go immediately and acquaint her brother.\r\n\r\nSophia then threw herself at her feet, and laying hold of her hands,\r\nbegged her with tears to conceal what she had drawn from her; urging\r\nthe violence of her father's temper, and protesting that no\r\ninclinations of hers should ever prevail with her to do anything which\r\nmight offend him.\r\n\r\nMrs Western stood a moment looking at her, and then, having\r\nrecollected herself, said, “That on one consideration only she would\r\nkeep the secret from her brother; and this was, that Sophia should\r\npromise to entertain Mr Blifil that very afternoon as her lover, and\r\nto regard him as the person who was to be her husband.”\r\n\r\nPoor Sophia was too much in her aunt's power to deny her anything\r\npositively; she was obliged to promise that she would see Mr Blifil,\r\nand be as civil to him as possible; but begged her aunt that the match\r\nmight not be hurried on. She said, “Mr Blifil was by no means\r\nagreeable to her, and she hoped her father would be prevailed on not\r\nto make her the most wretched of women.”\r\n\r\nMrs Western assured her, “That the match was entirely agreed upon, and\r\nthat nothing could or should prevent it. I must own,” said she, “I\r\nlooked on it as on a matter of indifference; nay, perhaps, had some\r\nscruples about it before, which were actually got over by my thinking\r\nit highly agreeable to your own inclinations; but now I regard it as\r\nthe most eligible thing in the world: nor shall there be, if I can\r\nprevent it, a moment of time lost on the occasion.”\r\n\r\nSophia replied, “Delay at least, madam, I may expect from both your\r\ngoodness and my father's. Surely you will give me time to endeavour to\r\nget the better of so strong a disinclination as I have at present to\r\nthis person.”\r\n\r\nThe aunt answered, “She knew too much of the world to be so deceived;\r\nthat as she was sensible another man had her affections, she should\r\npersuade Mr Western to hasten the match as much as possible. It would\r\nbe bad politics, indeed,” added she, “to protract a siege when the\r\nenemy's army is at hand, and in danger of relieving it. No, no,\r\nSophy,” said she, “as I am convinced you have a violent passion which\r\nyou can never satisfy with honour, I will do all I can to put your\r\nhonour out of the care of your family: for when you are married those\r\nmatters will belong only to the consideration of your husband. I hope,\r\nchild, you will always have prudence enough to act as becomes you; but\r\nif you should not, marriage hath saved many a woman from ruin.”\r\n\r\nSophia well understood what her aunt meant; but did not think proper\r\nto make her an answer. However, she took a resolution to see Mr\r\nBlifil, and to behave to him as civilly as she could, for on that\r\ncondition only she obtained a promise from her aunt to keep secret the\r\nliking which her ill fortune, rather than any scheme of Mrs Western,\r\nhad unhappily drawn from her."

      "content": "Containing a dialogue between Sophia and Mrs Honour, which may a\r\nlittle relieve those tender affections which the foregoing scene may\r\nhave raised in the mind of a good-natured reader.\r\n\nMrs Western having obtained that promise from her niece which we have\r\nseen in the last chapter, withdrew; and presently after arrived Mrs\r\nHonour. She was at work in a neighbouring apartment, and had been\r\nsummoned to the keyhole by some vociferation in the preceding\r\ndialogue, where she had continued during the remaining part of it. At\r\nher entry into the room, she found Sophia standing motionless, with\r\nthe tears trickling from her eyes. Upon which she immediately ordered\r\na proper quantity of tears into her own eyes, and then began, “O\r\nGemini, my dear lady, what is the matter?”--“Nothing,” cries Sophia.\r\n“Nothing! O dear Madam!” answers Honour, “you must not tell me that,\r\nwhen your ladyship is in this taking, and when there hath been such a\r\npreamble between your ladyship and Madam Western.”--“Don't teaze me,”\r\n cries Sophia; “I tell you nothing is the matter. Good heavens! why was\r\nI born?”--“Nay, madam,” says Mrs Honour, “you shall never persuade me\r\nthat your la'ship can lament yourself so for nothing. To be sure I am\r\nbut a servant; but to be sure I have been always faithful to your\r\nla'ship, and to be sure I would serve your la'ship with my life.”--“My\r\ndear Honour,” says Sophia, “'tis not in thy power to be of any service\r\nto me. I am irretrievably undone.”--“Heaven forbid!” answered the\r\nwaiting-woman; “but if I can't be of any service to you, pray tell me,\r\nmadam--it will be some comfort to me to know--pray, dear ma'am, tell\r\nme what's the matter.”--“My father,” cries Sophia, “is going to marry\r\nme to a man I both despise and hate.”--“O dear, ma'am,” answered the\r\nother, “who is this wicked man? for to be sure he is very bad, or your\r\nla'ship would not despise him.”--“His name is poison to my tongue,”\r\n replied Sophia: “thou wilt know it too soon.” Indeed, to confess the\r\ntruth, she knew it already, and therefore was not very inquisitive as\r\nto that point. She then proceeded thus: “I don't pretend to give your\r\nla'ship advice, whereof your la'ship knows much better than I can\r\npretend to, being but a servant; but, i-fackins! no father in England\r\nshould marry me against my consent. And, to be sure, the 'squire is so\r\ngood, that if he did but know your la'ship despises and hates the\r\nyoung man, to be sure he would not desire you to marry him. And if\r\nyour la'ship would but give me leave to tell my master so. To be sure,\r\nit would be more properer to come from your own mouth; but as your\r\nla'ship doth not care to foul your tongue with his nasty name--“--“You\r\nare mistaken, Honour,” says Sophia; “my father was determined before\r\nhe ever thought fit to mention it to me.”--“More shame for him,” cries\r\nHonour: “you are to go to bed to him, and not master: and thof a man\r\nmay be a very proper man, yet every woman mayn't think him handsome\r\nalike. I am sure my master would never act in this manner of his own\r\nhead. I wish some people would trouble themselves only with what\r\nbelongs to them; they would not, I believe, like to be served so, if\r\nit was their own case; for though I am a maid, I can easily believe as\r\nhow all men are not equally agreeable. And what signifies your la'ship\r\nhaving so great a fortune, if you can't please yourself with the man\r\nyou think most handsomest? Well, I say nothing; but to be sure it is a\r\npity some folks had not been better born; nay, as for that matter, I\r\nshould not mind it myself; but then there is not so much money; and\r\nwhat of that? your la'ship hath money enough for both; and where can\r\nyour la'ship bestow your fortune better? for to be sure every one must\r\nallow that he is the most handsomest, charmingest, finest, tallest,\r\nproperest man in the world.”--“What do you mean by running on in this\r\nmanner to me?” cries Sophia, with a very grave countenance. “Have I\r\never given any encouragement for these liberties?”--“Nay, ma'am, I ask\r\npardon; I meant no harm,” answered she; “but to be sure the poor\r\ngentleman hath run in my head ever since I saw him this morning. To be\r\nsure, if your la'ship had but seen him just now, you must have pitied\r\nhim. Poor gentleman! I wishes some misfortune hath not happened to\r\nhim; for he hath been walking about with his arms across, and looking\r\nso melancholy, all this morning: I vow and protest it made me almost\r\ncry to see him.”--“To see whom?” says Sophia. “Poor Mr Jones,”\r\n answered Honour. “See him! why, where did you see him?” cries Sophia.\r\n“By the canal, ma'am,” says Honour. “There he hath been walking all\r\nthis morning, and at last there he laid himself down: I believe he\r\nlies there still. To be sure, if it had not been for my modesty, being\r\na maid, as I am, I should have gone and spoke to him. Do, ma'am, let\r\nme go and see, only for a fancy, whether he is there still.”--“Pugh!”\r\n says Sophia. “There! no, no: what should he do there? He is gone\r\nbefore this time, to be sure. Besides, why--what--why should you go to\r\nsee? besides, I want you for something else. Go, fetch me my hat and\r\ngloves. I shall walk with my aunt in the grove before dinner.” Honour\r\ndid immediately as she was bid, and Sophia put her hat on; when,\r\nlooking in the glass, she fancied the ribbon with which her hat was\r\ntied did not become her, and so sent her maid back again for a ribbon\r\nof a different colour; and then giving Mrs Honour repeated charges not\r\nto leave her work on any account, as she said it was in violent haste,\r\nand must be finished that very day, she muttered something more about\r\ngoing to the grove, and then sallied out the contrary way, and walked,\r\nas fast as her tender trembling limbs could carry her, directly\r\ntowards the canal.\r\n\r\nJones had been there as Mrs Honour had told her; he had indeed spent\r\ntwo hours there that morning in melancholy contemplation on his\r\nSophia, and had gone out from the garden at one door the moment she\r\nentered it at another. So that those unlucky minutes which had been\r\nspent in changing the ribbons, had prevented the lovers from meeting\r\nat this time;--a most unfortunate accident, from which my fair readers\r\nwill not fail to draw a very wholesome lesson. And here I strictly\r\nforbid all male critics to intermeddle with a circumstance which I\r\nhave recounted only for the sake of the ladies, and upon which they\r\nonly are at liberty to comment."

      "content": "A picture of formal courtship in miniature, as it always ought to be\r\ndrawn, and a scene of a tenderer kind painted at full length.\r\n\nIt was well remarked by one (and perhaps by more), that misfortunes do\r\nnot come single. This wise maxim was now verified by Sophia, who was\r\nnot only disappointed of seeing the man she loved, but had the\r\nvexation of being obliged to dress herself out, in order to receive a\r\nvisit from the man she hated.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon Mr Western, for the first time, acquainted his daughter\r\nwith his intention; telling her, he knew very well that she had heard\r\nit before from her aunt. Sophia looked very grave upon this, nor could\r\nshe prevent a few pearls from stealing into her eyes. “Come, come,”\r\n says Western, “none of your maidenish airs; I know all; I assure you\r\nsister hath told me all.”\r\n\r\n“Is it possible,” says Sophia, “that my aunt can have betrayed me\r\nalready?”--“Ay, ay,” says Western; “betrayed you! ay. Why, you\r\nbetrayed yourself yesterday at dinner. You showed your fancy very\r\nplainly, I think. But you young girls never know what you would be at.\r\nSo you cry because I am going to marry you to the man you are in love\r\nwith! Your mother, I remember, whimpered and whined just in the same\r\nmanner; but it was all over within twenty-four hours after we were\r\nmarried: Mr Blifil is a brisk young man, and will soon put an end to\r\nyour squeamishness. Come, chear up, chear up; I expect un every\r\nminute.”\r\n\r\nSophia was now convinced that her aunt had behaved honourably to her:\r\nand she determined to go through that disagreeable afternoon with as\r\nmuch resolution as possible, and without giving the least suspicion in\r\nthe world to her father.\r\n\r\nMr Blifil soon arrived; and Mr Western soon after withdrawing, left\r\nthe young couple together.\r\n\r\nHere a long silence of near a quarter of an hour ensued; for the\r\ngentleman who was to begin the conversation had all the unbecoming\r\nmodesty which consists in bashfulness. He often attempted to speak,\r\nand as often suppressed his words just at the very point of utterance.\r\nAt last out they broke in a torrent of far-fetched and high-strained\r\ncompliments, which were answered on her side by downcast looks, half\r\nbows, and civil monosyllables. Blifil, from his inexperience in the\r\nways of women, and from his conceit of himself, took this behaviour\r\nfor a modest assent to his courtship; and when, to shorten a scene\r\nwhich she could no longer support, Sophia rose up and left the room,\r\nhe imputed that, too, merely to bashfulness, and comforted himself\r\nthat he should soon have enough of her company.\r\n\r\nHe was indeed perfectly well satisfied with his prospect of success;\r\nfor as to that entire and absolute possession of the heart of his\r\nmistress which romantic lovers require, the very idea of it never\r\nentered his head. Her fortune and her person were the sole objects of\r\nhis wishes, of which he made no doubt soon to obtain the absolute\r\nproperty; as Mr Western's mind was so earnestly bent on the match; and\r\nas he well knew the strict obedience which Sophia was always ready to\r\npay to her father's will, and the greater still which her father would\r\nexact, if there was occasion. This authority, therefore, together with\r\nthe charms which he fancied in his own person and conversation, could\r\nnot fail, he thought, of succeeding with a young lady, whose\r\ninclinations were, he doubted not, entirely disengaged.\r\n\r\nOf Jones he certainly had not even the least jealousy; and I have\r\noften thought it wonderful that he had not. Perhaps he imagined the\r\ncharacter which Jones bore all over the country (how justly, let the\r\nreader determine), of being one of the wildest fellows in England,\r\nmight render him odious to a lady of the most exemplary modesty.\r\nPerhaps his suspicions might be laid asleep by the behaviour of\r\nSophia, and of Jones himself, when they were all in company together.\r\nLastly, and indeed principally, he was well assured there was not\r\nanother self in the case. He fancied that he knew Jones to the bottom,\r\nand had in reality a great contempt for his understanding, for not\r\nbeing more attached to his own interest. He had no apprehension that\r\nJones was in love with Sophia; and as for any lucrative motives, he\r\nimagined they would sway very little with so silly a fellow. Blifil,\r\nmoreover, thought the affair of Molly Seagrim still went on, and\r\nindeed believed it would end in marriage; for Jones really loved him\r\nfrom his childhood, and had kept no secret from him, till his\r\nbehaviour on the sickness of Mr Allworthy had entirely alienated his\r\nheart; and it was by means of the quarrel which had ensued on this\r\noccasion, and which was not yet reconciled, that Mr Blifil knew\r\nnothing of the alteration which had happened in the affection which\r\nJones had formerly borne towards Molly.\r\n\r\nFrom these reasons, therefore, Mr Blifil saw no bar to his success\r\nwith Sophia. He concluded her behaviour was like that of all other\r\nyoung ladies on a first visit from a lover, and it had indeed entirely\r\nanswered his expectations.\r\n\r\nMr Western took care to way-lay the lover at his exit from his\r\nmistress. He found him so elevated with his success, so enamoured with\r\nhis daughter, and so satisfied with her reception of him, that the old\r\ngentleman began to caper and dance about his hall, and by many other\r\nantic actions to express the extravagance of his joy; for he had not\r\nthe least command over any of his passions; and that which had at any\r\ntime the ascendant in his mind hurried him to the wildest excesses.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Blifil was departed, which was not till after many hearty\r\nkisses and embraces bestowed on him by Western, the good squire went\r\ninstantly in quest of his daughter, whom he no sooner found than he\r\npoured forth the most extravagant raptures, bidding her chuse what\r\nclothes and jewels she pleased; and declaring that he had no other use\r\nfor fortune but to make her happy. He then caressed her again and\r\nagain with the utmost profusion of fondness, called her by the most\r\nendearing names, and protested she was his only joy on earth.\r\n\r\nSophia perceiving her father in this fit of affection, which she did\r\nnot absolutely know the reason of (for fits of fondness were not\r\nunusual to him, though this was rather more violent than ordinary),\r\nthought she should never have a better opportunity of disclosing\r\nherself than at present, as far at least as regarded Mr Blifil; and\r\nshe too well foresaw the necessity which she should soon be under of\r\ncoming to a full explanation. After having thanked the squire,\r\ntherefore, for all his professions of kindness, she added, with a look\r\nfull of inexpressible softness, “And is it possible my papa can be so\r\ngood to place all his joy in his Sophy's happiness?” which Western\r\nhaving confirmed by a great oath, and a kiss; she then laid hold of\r\nhis hand, and, falling on her knees, after many warm and passionate\r\ndeclarations of affection and duty, she begged him “not to make her\r\nthe most miserable creature on earth by forcing her to marry a man\r\nwhom she detested. This I entreat of you, dear sir,” said she, “for\r\nyour sake, as well as my own, since you are so very kind to tell me\r\nyour happiness depends on mine.”--“How! what!” says Western, staring\r\nwildly. “Oh! sir,” continued she, “not only your poor Sophy's\r\nhappiness; her very life, her being, depends upon your granting her\r\nrequest. I cannot live with Mr Blifil. To force me into this marriage\r\nwould be killing me.”--“You can't live with Mr Blifil?” says Western.\r\n“No, upon my soul I can't,” answered Sophia. “Then die and be d--d,”\r\n cries he, spurning her from him. “Oh! sir,” cries Sophia, catching\r\nhold of the skirt of his coat, “take pity on me, I beseech you. Don't\r\nlook and say such cruel--Can you be unmoved while you see your Sophy\r\nin this dreadful condition? Can the best of fathers break my heart?\r\nWill he kill me by the most painful, cruel, lingering death?”--“Pooh!\r\npooh!” cries the squire; “all stuff and nonsense; all maidenish\r\ntricks. Kill you, indeed! Will marriage kill you?”--“Oh! sir,”\r\n answered Sophia, “such a marriage is worse than death. He is not even\r\nindifferent; I hate and detest him.”--“If you detest un never so\r\nmuch,” cries Western, “you shall ha'un.” This he bound by an oath too\r\nshocking to repeat; and after many violent asseverations, concluded in\r\nthese words: “I am resolved upon the match, and unless you consent to\r\nit I will not give you a groat, not a single farthing; no, though I\r\nsaw you expiring with famine in the street, I would not relieve you\r\nwith a morsel of bread. This is my fixed resolution, and so I leave\r\nyou to consider on it.” He then broke from her with such violence,\r\nthat her face dashed against the floor; and he burst directly out of\r\nthe room, leaving poor Sophia prostrate on the ground.\r\n\r\nWhen Western came into the hall, he there found Jones; who seeing his\r\nfriend looking wild, pale, and almost breathless, could not forbear\r\nenquiring the reason of all these melancholy appearances. Upon which\r\nthe squire immediately acquainted him with the whole matter,\r\nconcluding with bitter denunciations against Sophia, and very pathetic\r\nlamentations of the misery of all fathers who are so unfortunate to\r\nhave daughters.\r\n\r\nJones, to whom all the resolutions which had been taken in favour of\r\nBlifil were yet a secret, was at first almost struck dead with this\r\nrelation; but recovering his spirits a little, mere despair, as he\r\nafterwards said, inspired him to mention a matter to Mr Western, which\r\nseemed to require more impudence than a human forehead was ever gifted\r\nwith. He desired leave to go to Sophia, that he might endeavour to\r\nobtain her concurrence with her father's inclinations.\r\n\r\nIf the squire had been as quicksighted as he was remarkable for the\r\ncontrary, passion might at present very well have blinded him. He\r\nthanked Jones for offering to undertake the office, and said, “Go, go,\r\nprithee, try what canst do;” and then swore many execrable oaths that\r\nhe would turn her out of doors unless she consented to the match."

      "content": "The meeting between Jones and Sophia.\r\n\nJones departed instantly in quest of Sophia, whom he found just risen\r\nfrom the ground, where her father had left her, with the tears\r\ntrickling from her eyes, and the blood running from her lips. He\r\npresently ran to her, and with a voice full at once of tenderness and\r\nterrour, cried, “O my Sophia, what means this dreadful sight?” She\r\nlooked softly at him for a moment before she spoke, and then said, “Mr\r\nJones, for Heaven's sake how came you here?--Leave me, I beseech you,\r\nthis moment.”--“Do not,” says he, “impose so harsh a command upon\r\nme--my heart bleeds faster than those lips. O Sophia, how easily could\r\nI drain my veins to preserve one drop of that dear blood.”--“I have\r\ntoo many obligations to you already,” answered she, “for sure you\r\nmeant them such.” Here she looked at him tenderly almost a minute, and\r\nthen bursting into an agony, cried, “Oh, Mr Jones, why did you save my\r\nlife? my death would have been happier for us both.”--“Happier for us\r\nboth!” cried he. “Could racks or wheels kill me so painfully as\r\nSophia's--I cannot bear the dreadful sound. Do I live but for her?”\r\n Both his voice and looks were full of inexpressible tenderness when he\r\nspoke these words; and at the same time he laid gently hold on her\r\nhand, which she did not withdraw from him; to say the truth, she\r\nhardly knew what she did or suffered. A few moments now passed in\r\nsilence between these lovers, while his eyes were eagerly fixed on\r\nSophia, and hers declining towards the ground: at last she recovered\r\nstrength enough to desire him again to leave her, for that her certain\r\nruin would be the consequence of their being found together; adding,\r\n“Oh, Mr Jones, you know not, you know not what hath passed this cruel\r\nafternoon.”--“I know all, my Sophia,” answered he; “your cruel father\r\nhath told me all, and he himself hath sent me hither to you.”--“My\r\nfather sent you to me!” replied she: “sure you dream.”--“Would to\r\nHeaven,” cries he, “it was but a dream! Oh, Sophia, your father hath\r\nsent me to you, to be an advocate for my odious rival, to solicit you\r\nin his favour. I took any means to get access to you. O speak to me,\r\nSophia! comfort my bleeding heart. Sure no one ever loved, ever doated\r\nlike me. Do not unkindly withhold this dear, this soft, this gentle\r\nhand--one moment, perhaps, tears you for ever from me--nothing less\r\nthan this cruel occasion could, I believe, have ever conquered the\r\nrespect and awe with which you have inspired me.” She stood a moment\r\nsilent, and covered with confusion; then lifting up her eyes gently\r\ntowards him, she cried, “What would Mr Jones have me say?”--“O do but\r\npromise,” cries he, “that you never will give yourself to\r\nBlifil.”--“Name not,” answered she, “the detested sound. Be assured I\r\nnever will give him what is in my power to withhold from him.”--“Now\r\nthen,” cries he, “while you are so perfectly kind, go a little\r\nfarther, and add that I may hope.”--“Alas!” says she, “Mr Jones,\r\nwhither will you drive me? What hope have I to bestow? You know my\r\nfather's intentions.”--“But I know,” answered he, “your compliance\r\nwith them cannot be compelled.”--“What,” says she, “must be the\r\ndreadful consequence of my disobedience? My own ruin is my least\r\nconcern. I cannot bear the thoughts of being the cause of my father's\r\nmisery.”--“He is himself the cause,” cries Jones, “by exacting a power\r\nover you which Nature hath not given him. Think on the misery which I\r\nam to suffer if I am to lose you, and see on which side pity will turn\r\nthe balance.”--“Think of it!” replied she: “can you imagine I do not\r\nfeel the ruin which I must bring on you, should I comply with your\r\ndesire? It is that thought which gives me resolution to bid you fly\r\nfrom me for ever, and avoid your own destruction.”--“I fear no\r\ndestruction,” cries he, “but the loss of Sophia. If you would save me\r\nfrom the most bitter agonies, recall that cruel sentence. Indeed, I\r\ncan never part with you, indeed I cannot.”\r\n\r\nThe lovers now stood both silent and trembling, Sophia being unable to\r\nwithdraw her hand from Jones, and he almost as unable to hold it; when\r\nthe scene, which I believe some of my readers will think had lasted\r\nlong enough, was interrupted by one of so different a nature, that we\r\nshall reserve the relation of it for a different chapter."

      "content": "Being of a much more tempestuous kind than the former.\r\n\nBefore we proceed with what now happened to our lovers, it may be\r\nproper to recount what had past in the hall during their tender\r\ninterview.\r\n\r\nSoon after Jones had left Mr Western in the manner above mentioned,\r\nhis sister came to him, and was presently informed of all that had\r\npassed between her brother and Sophia relating to Blifil.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour in her niece the good lady construed to be an absolute\r\nbreach of the condition on which she had engaged to keep her love for\r\nMr Jones a secret. She considered herself, therefore, at full liberty\r\nto reveal all she knew to the squire, which she immediately did in the\r\nmost explicit terms, and without any ceremony or preface.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a marriage between Jones and his daughter, had never once\r\nentered into the squire's head, either in the warmest minutes of his\r\naffection towards that young man, or from suspicion, or on any other\r\noccasion. He did indeed consider a parity of fortune and circumstances\r\nto be physically as necessary an ingredient in marriage, as difference\r\nof sexes, or any other essential; and had no more apprehension of his\r\ndaughter's falling in love with a poor man, than with any animal of a\r\ndifferent species.\r\n\r\nHe became, therefore, like one thunderstruck at his sister's relation.\r\nHe was, at first, incapable of making any answer, having been almost\r\ndeprived of his breath by the violence of the surprize. This, however,\r\nsoon returned, and, as is usual in other cases after an intermission,\r\nwith redoubled force and fury.\r\n\r\nThe first use he made of the power of speech, after his recovery from\r\nthe sudden effects of his astonishment, was to discharge a round\r\nvolley of oaths and imprecations. After which he proceeded hastily to\r\nthe apartment where he expected to find the lovers, and murmured, or\r\nrather indeed roared forth, intentions of revenge every step he went.\r\n\r\nAs when two doves, or two wood-pigeons, or as when Strephon and\r\nPhyllis (for that comes nearest to the mark) are retired into some\r\npleasant solitary grove, to enjoy the delightful conversation of Love,\r\nthat bashful boy, who cannot speak in public, and is never a good\r\ncompanion to more than two at a time; here, while every object is\r\nserene, should hoarse thunder burst suddenly through the shattered\r\nclouds, and rumbling roll along the sky, the frightened maid starts\r\nfrom the mossy bank or verdant turf, the pale livery of death succeeds\r\nthe red regimentals in which Love had before drest her cheeks, fear\r\nshakes her whole frame, and her lover scarce supports her trembling\r\ntottering limbs.\r\n\r\nOr as when two gentlemen, strangers to the wondrous wit of the place,\r\nare cracking a bottle together at some inn or tavern at Salisbury, if\r\nthe great Dowdy, who acts the part of a madman as well as some of his\r\nsetters-on do that of a fool, should rattle his chains, and dreadfully\r\nhum forth the grumbling catch along the gallery; the frighted\r\nstrangers stand aghast; scared at the horrid sound, they seek some\r\nplace of shelter from the approaching danger; and if the well-barred\r\nwindows did admit their exit, would venture their necks to escape the\r\nthreatening fury now coming upon them.\r\n\r\nSo trembled poor Sophia, so turned she pale at the noise of her\r\nfather, who, in a voice most dreadful to hear, came on swearing,\r\ncursing, and vowing the destruction of Jones. To say the truth, I\r\nbelieve the youth himself would, from some prudent considerations,\r\nhave preferred another place of abode at this time, had his terror on\r\nSophia's account given him liberty to reflect a moment on what any\r\notherways concerned himself, than as his love made him partake\r\nwhatever affected her.\r\n\r\nAnd now the squire, having burst open the door, beheld an object which\r\ninstantly suspended all his fury against Jones; this was the ghastly\r\nappearance of Sophia, who had fainted away in her lover's arms. This\r\ntragical sight Mr Western no sooner beheld, than all his rage forsook\r\nhim; he roared for help with his utmost violence; ran first to his\r\ndaughter, then back to the door calling for water, and then back again\r\nto Sophia, never considering in whose arms she then was, nor perhaps\r\nonce recollecting that there was such a person in the world as Jones;\r\nfor indeed I believe the present circumstances of his daughter were\r\nnow the sole consideration which employed his thoughts.\r\n\r\nMrs Western and a great number of servants soon came to the assistance\r\nof Sophia with water, cordials, and everything necessary on those\r\noccasions. These were applied with such success, that Sophia in a very\r\nfew minutes began to recover, and all the symptoms of life to return.\r\nUpon which she was presently led off by her own maid and Mrs Western:\r\nnor did that good lady depart without leaving some wholesome\r\nadmonitions with her brother, on the dreadful effects of his passion,\r\nor, as she pleased to call it, madness.\r\n\r\nThe squire, perhaps, did not understand this good advice, as it was\r\ndelivered in obscure hints, shrugs, and notes of admiration: at least,\r\nif he did understand it, he profited very little by it; for no sooner\r\nwas he cured of his immediate fears for his daughter, than he relapsed\r\ninto his former frenzy, which must have produced an immediate battle\r\nwith Jones, had not parson Supple, who was a very strong man, been\r\npresent, and by mere force restrained the squire from acts of\r\nhostility.\r\n\r\nThe moment Sophia was departed, Jones advanced in a very suppliant\r\nmanner to Mr Western, whom the parson held in his arms, and begged him\r\nto be pacified; for that, while he continued in such a passion, it\r\nwould be impossible to give him any satisfaction.\r\n\r\n“I wull have satisfaction o' thee,” answered the squire; “so doff thy\r\nclothes. _At unt_ half a man, and I'll lick thee as well as wast ever\r\nlicked in thy life.” He then bespattered the youth with abundance of\r\nthat language which passes between country gentlemen who embrace\r\nopposite sides of the question; with frequent applications to him to\r\nsalute that part which is generally introduced into all controversies\r\nthat arise among the lower orders of the English gentry at\r\nhorse-races, cock-matches, and other public places. Allusions to this\r\npart are likewise often made for the sake of the jest. And here, I\r\nbelieve, the wit is generally misunderstood. In reality, it lies in\r\ndesiring another to kiss your a-- for having just before threatened to\r\nkick his; for I have observed very accurately, that no one ever\r\ndesires you to kick that which belongs to himself, nor offers to kiss\r\nthis part in another.\r\n\r\nIt may likewise seem surprizing that in the many thousand kind\r\ninvitations of this sort, which every one who hath conversed with\r\ncountry gentlemen must have heard, no one, I believe, hath ever seen a\r\nsingle instance where the desire hath been complied with;--a great\r\ninstance of their want of politeness; for in town nothing can be more\r\ncommon than for the finest gentlemen to perform this ceremony every\r\nday to their superiors, without having that favour once requested of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nTo all such wit, Jones very calmly answered, “Sir, this usage may\r\nperhaps cancel every other obligation you have conferred on me; but\r\nthere is one you can never cancel; nor will I be provoked by your\r\nabuse to lift my hand against the father of Sophia.”\r\n\r\nAt these words the squire grew still more outrageous than before; so\r\nthat the parson begged Jones to retire; saying, “You behold, sir, how\r\nhe waxeth wrath at your abode here; therefore let me pray you not to\r\ntarry any longer. His anger is too much kindled for you to commune\r\nwith him at present. You had better, therefore, conclude your visit,\r\nand refer what matters you have to urge in your behalf to some other\r\nopportunity.”\r\n\r\nJones accepted this advice with thanks, and immediately departed. The\r\nsquire now regained the liberty of his hands, and so much temper as to\r\nexpress some satisfaction in the restraint which had been laid upon\r\nhim; declaring that he should certainly have beat his brains out; and\r\nadding, “It would have vexed one confoundedly to have been hanged for\r\nsuch a rascal.”\r\n\r\nThe parson now began to triumph in the success of his peace-making\r\nendeavours, and proceeded to read a lecture against anger, which might\r\nperhaps rather have tended to raise than to quiet that passion in some\r\nhasty minds. This lecture he enriched with many valuable quotations\r\nfrom the antients, particularly from Seneca; who hath indeed so well\r\nhandled this passion, that none but a very angry man can read him\r\nwithout great pleasure and profit. The doctor concluded this harangue\r\nwith the famous story of Alexander and Clitus; but as I find that\r\nentered in my common-place under title Drunkenness, I shall not insert\r\nit here.\r\n\r\nThe squire took no notice of this story, nor perhaps of anything he\r\nsaid; for he interrupted him before he had finished, by calling for a\r\ntankard of beer; observing (which is perhaps as true as any\r\nobservation on this fever of the mind) that anger makes a man dry.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the squire swallowed a large draught than he renewed the\r\ndiscourse on Jones, and declared a resolution of going the next\r\nmorning early to acquaint Mr Allworthy. His friend would have\r\ndissuaded him from this, from the mere motive of good-nature; but his\r\ndissuasion had no other effect than to produce a large volley of oaths\r\nand curses, which greatly shocked the pious ears of Supple; but he did\r\nnot dare to remonstrate against a privilege which the squire claimed\r\nas a freeborn Englishman. To say truth, the parson submitted to please\r\nhis palate at the squire's table, at the expense of suffering now and\r\nthen this violence to his ears. He contented himself with thinking he\r\ndid not promote this evil practice, and that the squire would not\r\nswear an oath the less, if he never entered within his gates. However,\r\nthough he was not guilty of ill manners by rebuking a gentleman in his\r\nown house, he paid him off obliquely in the pulpit: which had not,\r\nindeed, the good effect of working a reformation in the squire\r\nhimself; yet it so far operated on his conscience, that he put the\r\nlaws very severely in execution against others, and the magistrate was\r\nthe only person in the parish who could swear with impunity."

      "content": "In which Mr Western visits Mr Allworthy.\r\n\nMr Allworthy was now retired from breakfast with his nephew, well\r\nsatisfied with the report of the young gentleman's successful visit to\r\nSophia (for he greatly desired the match, more on account of the young\r\nlady's character than of her riches), when Mr Western broke abruptly\r\nin upon them, and without any ceremony began as follows:--\r\n\r\n“There, you have done a fine piece of work truly! You have brought up\r\nyour bastard to a fine purpose; not that I believe you have had any\r\nhand in it neither, that is, as a man may say, designedly: but there\r\nis a fine kettle-of-fish made on't up at our house.” “What can be the\r\nmatter, Mr Western?” said Allworthy. “O, matter enow of all\r\nconscience: my daughter hath fallen in love with your bastard, that's\r\nall; but I won't ge her a hapeny, not the twentieth part of a brass\r\nvarden. I always thought what would come o' breeding up a bastard like\r\na gentleman, and letting un come about to vok's houses. It's well vor\r\nun I could not get at un: I'd a lick'd un; I'd a spoil'd his\r\ncaterwauling; I'd a taught the son of a whore to meddle with meat for\r\nhis master. He shan't ever have a morsel of meat of mine, or a varden\r\nto buy it: if she will ha un, one smock shall be her portion. I'd\r\nsooner ge my esteate to the zinking fund, that it may be sent to\r\nHanover to corrupt our nation with.” “I am heartily sorry,” cries\r\nAllworthy. “Pox o' your sorrow,” says Western; “it will do me\r\nabundance of good when I have lost my only child, my poor Sophy, that\r\nwas the joy of my heart, and all the hope and comfort of my age; but I\r\nam resolved I will turn her out o' doors; she shall beg, and starve,\r\nand rot in the streets. Not one hapeny, not a hapeny shall she ever\r\nhae o' mine. The son of a bitch was always good at finding a hare\r\nsitting, an be rotted to'n: I little thought what puss he was looking\r\nafter; but it shall be the worst he ever vound in his life. She shall\r\nbe no better than carrion: the skin o'er is all he shall ha, and zu\r\nyou may tell un.” “I am in amazement,” cries Allworthy, “at what you\r\ntell me, after what passed between my nephew and the young lady no\r\nlonger ago than yesterday.” “Yes, sir,” answered Western, “it was\r\nafter what passed between your nephew and she that the whole matter\r\ncame out. Mr Blifil there was no sooner gone than the son of a whore\r\ncame lurching about the house. Little did I think when I used to love\r\nhim for a sportsman that he was all the while a poaching after my\r\ndaughter.” “Why truly,” says Allworthy, “I could wish you had not\r\ngiven him so many opportunities with her; and you will do me the\r\njustice to acknowledge that I have always been averse to his staying\r\nso much at your house, though I own I had no suspicion of this kind.”\r\n “Why, zounds,” cries Western, “who could have thought it? What the\r\ndevil had she to do wi'n? He did not come there a courting to her; he\r\ncame there a hunting with me.” “But was it possible,” says Allworthy,\r\n“that you should never discern any symptoms of love between them, when\r\nyou have seen them so often together?” “Never in my life, as I hope to\r\nbe saved,” cries Western: “I never so much as zeed him kiss her in all\r\nmy life; and so far from courting her, he used rather to be more\r\nsilent when she was in company than at any other time; and as for the\r\ngirl, she was always less civil to'n than to any young man that came\r\nto the house. As to that matter, I am not more easy to be deceived\r\nthan another; I would not have you think I am, neighbour.” Allworthy\r\ncould scarce refrain laughter at this; but he resolved to do a\r\nviolence to himself; for he perfectly well knew mankind, and had too\r\nmuch good-breeding and good-nature to offend the squire in his present\r\ncircumstances. He then asked Western what he would have him do upon\r\nthis occasion. To which the other answered, “That he would have him\r\nkeep the rascal away from his house, and that he would go and lock up\r\nthe wench; for he was resolved to make her marry Mr Blifil in spite of\r\nher teeth.” He then shook Blifil by the hand, and swore he would have\r\nno other son-in-law. Presently after which he took his leave; saying\r\nhis house was in such disorder that it was necessary for him to make\r\nhaste home, to take care his daughter did not give him the slip; and\r\nas for Jones, he swore if he caught him at his house, he would qualify\r\nhim to run for the geldings' plate.\r\n\r\nWhen Allworthy and Blifil were again left together, a long silence\r\nensued between them; all which interval the young gentleman filled up\r\nwith sighs, which proceeded partly from disappointment, but more from\r\nhatred; for the success of Jones was much more grievous to him than\r\nthe loss of Sophia.\r\n\r\nAt length his uncle asked him what he was determined to do, and he\r\nanswered in the following words:--“Alas! sir, can it be a question\r\nwhat step a lover will take, when reason and passion point different\r\nways? I am afraid it is too certain he will, in that dilemma, always\r\nfollow the latter. Reason dictates to me, to quit all thoughts of a\r\nwoman who places her affections on another; my passion bids me hope\r\nshe may in time change her inclinations in my favour. Here, however, I\r\nconceive an objection may be raised, which, if it could not fully be\r\nanswered, would totally deter me from any further pursuit. I mean the\r\ninjustice of endeavouring to supplant another in a heart of which he\r\nseems already in possession; but the determined resolution of Mr\r\nWestern shows that, in this case, I shall, by so doing, promote the\r\nhappiness of every party; not only that of the parent, who will thus\r\nbe preserved from the highest degree of misery, but of both the\r\nothers, who must be undone by this match. The lady, I am sure, will be\r\nundone in every sense; for, besides the loss of most part of her own\r\nfortune, she will be not only married to a beggar, but the little\r\nfortune which her father cannot withhold from her will be squandered\r\non that wench with whom I know he yet converses. Nay, that is a\r\ntrifle; for I know him to be one of the worst men in the world; for\r\nhad my dear uncle known what I have hitherto endeavoured to conceal,\r\nhe must have long since abandoned so profligate a wretch.” “How!” said\r\nAllworthy; “hath he done anything worse than I already know? Tell me,\r\nI beseech you?” “No,” replied Blifil; “it is now past, and perhaps he\r\nmay have repented of it.” “I command you, on your duty,” said\r\nAllworthy, “to tell me what you mean.” “You know, sir,” says Blifil,\r\n“I never disobeyed you; but I am sorry I mentioned it, since it may\r\nnow look like revenge, whereas, I thank Heaven, no such motive ever\r\nentered my heart; and if you oblige me to discover it, I must be his\r\npetitioner to you for your forgiveness.” “I will have no conditions,”\r\n answered Allworthy; “I think I have shown tenderness enough towards\r\nhim, and more perhaps than you ought to thank me for.” “More, indeed,\r\nI fear, than he deserved,” cries Blifil; “for in the very day of your\r\nutmost danger, when myself and all the family were in tears, he filled\r\nthe house with riot and debauchery. He drank, and sung, and roared;\r\nand when I gave him a gentle hint of the indecency of his actions, he\r\nfell into a violent passion, swore many oaths, called me rascal, and\r\nstruck me.” “How!” cries Allworthy; “did he dare to strike you?” “I am\r\nsure,” cries Blifil, “I have forgiven him that long ago. I wish I\r\ncould so easily forget his ingratitude to the best of benefactors; and\r\nyet even that I hope you will forgive him, since he must have\r\ncertainly been possessed with the devil: for that very evening, as Mr\r\nThwackum and myself were taking the air in the fields, and exulting in\r\nthe good symptoms which then first began to discover themselves, we\r\nunluckily saw him engaged with a wench in a manner not fit to be\r\nmentioned. Mr Thwackum, with more boldness than prudence, advanced to\r\nrebuke him, when (I am sorry to say it) he fell upon the worthy man,\r\nand beat him so outrageously that I wish he may have yet recovered the\r\nbruises. Nor was I without my share of the effects of his malice,\r\nwhile I endeavoured to protect my tutor; but that I have long\r\nforgiven; nay, I prevailed with Mr Thwackum to forgive him too, and\r\nnot to inform you of a secret which I feared might be fatal to him.\r\nAnd now, sir, since I have unadvisedly dropped a hint of this matter,\r\nand your commands have obliged me to discover the whole, let me\r\nintercede with you for him.” “O child!” said Allworthy, “I know not\r\nwhether I should blame or applaud your goodness, in concealing such\r\nvillany a moment: but where is Mr Thwackum? Not that I want any\r\nconfirmation of what you say; but I will examine all the evidence of\r\nthis matter, to justify to the world the example I am resolved to make\r\nof such a monster.”\r\n\r\nThwackum was now sent for, and presently appeared. He corroborated\r\nevery circumstance which the other had deposed; nay, he produced the\r\nrecord upon his breast, where the handwriting of Mr Jones remained\r\nvery legible in black and blue. He concluded with declaring to Mr\r\nAllworthy, that he should have long since informed him of this matter,\r\nhad not Mr Blifil, by the most earnest interpositions, prevented him.\r\n“He is,” says he, “an excellent youth: though such forgiveness of\r\nenemies is carrying the matter too far.”\r\n\r\nIn reality, Blifil had taken some pains to prevail with the parson,\r\nand to prevent the discovery at that time; for which he had many\r\nreasons. He knew that the minds of men are apt to be softened and\r\nrelaxed from their usual severity by sickness. Besides, he imagined\r\nthat if the story was told when the fact was so recent, and the\r\nphysician about the house, who might have unravelled the real truth,\r\nhe should never be able to give it the malicious turn which he\r\nintended. Again, he resolved to hoard up this business, till the\r\nindiscretion of Jones should afford some additional complaints; for he\r\nthought the joint weight of many facts falling upon him together,\r\nwould be the most likely to crush him; and he watched, therefore, some\r\nsuch opportunity as that with which fortune had now kindly presented\r\nhim. Lastly, by prevailing with Thwackum to conceal the matter for a\r\ntime, he knew he should confirm an opinion of his friendship to Jones,\r\nwhich he had greatly laboured to establish in Mr Allworthy."

      "content": "A short chapter; but which contains sufficient matter to affect the\r\ngood-natured reader.\r\n\nIt was Mr Allworthy's custom never to punish any one, not even to turn\r\naway a servant, in a passion. He resolved therefore to delay passing\r\nsentence on Jones till the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe poor young man attended at dinner, as usual; but his heart was too\r\nmuch loaded to suffer him to eat. His grief too was a good deal\r\naggravated by the unkind looks of Mr Allworthy; whence he concluded\r\nthat Western had discovered the whole affair between him and Sophia;\r\nbut as to Mr Blifil's story, he had not the least apprehension; for of\r\nmuch the greater part he was entirely innocent; and for the residue,\r\nas he had forgiven and forgotten it himself, so he suspected no\r\nremembrance on the other side. When dinner was over, and the servants\r\ndeparted, Mr Allworthy began to harangue. He set forth, in a long\r\nspeech, the many iniquities of which Jones had been guilty,\r\nparticularly those which this day had brought to light; and concluded\r\nby telling him, “That unless he could clear himself of the charge, he\r\nwas resolved to banish him his sight for ever.”\r\n\r\nMany disadvantages attended poor Jones in making his defence; nay,\r\nindeed, he hardly knew his accusation; for as Mr Allworthy, in\r\nrecounting the drunkenness, &c., while he lay ill, out of modesty sunk\r\neverything that related particularly to himself, which indeed\r\nprincipally constituted the crime; Jones could not deny the charge.\r\nHis heart was, besides, almost broken already; and his spirits were so\r\nsunk, that he could say nothing for himself; but acknowledged the\r\nwhole, and, like a criminal in despair, threw himself upon mercy;\r\nconcluding, “That though he must own himself guilty of many follies\r\nand inadvertencies, he hoped he had done nothing to deserve what would\r\nbe to him the greatest punishment in the world.”\r\n\r\nAllworthy answered, “That he had forgiven him too often already, in\r\ncompassion to his youth, and in hopes of his amendment: that he now\r\nfound he was an abandoned reprobate, and such as it would be criminal\r\nin any one to support and encourage. Nay,” said Mr Allworthy to him,\r\n“your audacious attempt to steal away the young lady, calls upon me to\r\njustify my own character in punishing you. The world who have already\r\ncensured the regard I have shown for you may think, with some colour\r\nat least of justice, that I connive at so base and barbarous an\r\naction--an action of which you must have known my abhorrence: and\r\nwhich, had you had any concern for my ease and honour, as well as for\r\nmy friendship, you would never have thought of undertaking. Fie upon\r\nit, young man! indeed there is scarce any punishment equal to your\r\ncrimes, and I can scarce think myself justifiable in what I am now\r\ngoing to bestow on you. However, as I have educated you like a child\r\nof my own, I will not turn you naked into the world. When you open\r\nthis paper, therefore, you will find something which may enable you,\r\nwith industry, to get an honest livelihood; but if you employ it to\r\nworse purposes, I shall not think myself obliged to supply you\r\nfarther, being resolved, from this day forward, to converse no more\r\nwith you on any account. I cannot avoid saying, there is no part of\r\nyour conduct which I resent more than your ill-treatment of that good\r\nyoung man (meaning Blifil) who hath behaved with so much tenderness\r\nand honour towards you.”\r\n\r\nThese last words were a dose almost too bitter to be swallowed. A\r\nflood of tears now gushed from the eyes of Jones, and every faculty of\r\nspeech and motion seemed to have deserted him. It was some time before\r\nhe was able to obey Allworthy's peremptory commands of departing;\r\nwhich he at length did, having first kissed his hands with a passion\r\ndifficult to be affected, and as difficult to be described.\r\n\r\nThe reader must be very weak, if, when he considers the light in which\r\nJones then appeared to Mr Allworthy, he should blame the rigour of his\r\nsentence. And yet all the neighbourhood, either from this weakness, or\r\nfrom some worse motive, condemned this justice and severity as the\r\nhighest cruelty. Nay, the very persons who had before censured the\r\ngood man for the kindness and tenderness shown to a bastard (his own,\r\naccording to the general opinion), now cried out as loudly against\r\nturning his own child out of doors. The women especially were\r\nunanimous in taking the part of Jones, and raised more stories on the\r\noccasion than I have room, in this chapter, to set down.\r\n\r\nOne thing must not be omitted, that, in their censures on this\r\noccasion, none ever mentioned the sum contained in the paper which\r\nAllworthy gave Jones, which was no less than five hundred pounds; but\r\nall agreed that he was sent away penniless, and some said naked, from\r\nthe house of his inhuman father."

      "content": "Containing love-letters, &c.\r\n\nJones was commanded to leave the house immediately, and told, that his\r\nclothes and everything else should be sent to him whithersoever he\r\nshould order them.\r\n\r\nHe accordingly set out, and walked above a mile, not regarding, and\r\nindeed scarce knowing, whither he went. At length a little brook\r\nobstructing his passage, he threw himself down by the side of it; nor\r\ncould he help muttering with some little indignation, “Sure my father\r\nwill not deny me this place to rest in!”\r\n\r\nHere he presently fell into the most violent agonies, tearing his hair\r\nfrom his head, and using most other actions which generally accompany\r\nfits of madness, rage, and despair.\r\n\r\nWhen he had in this manner vented the first emotions of passion, he\r\nbegan to come a little to himself. His grief now took another turn,\r\nand discharged itself in a gentler way, till he became at last cool\r\nenough to reason with his passion, and to consider what steps were\r\nproper to be taken in his deplorable condition.\r\n\r\nAnd now the great doubt was, how to act with regard to Sophia. The\r\nthoughts of leaving her almost rent his heart asunder; but the\r\nconsideration of reducing her to ruin and beggary still racked him, if\r\npossible, more; and if the violent desire of possessing her person\r\ncould have induced him to listen one moment to this alternative, still\r\nhe was by no means certain of her resolution to indulge his wishes at\r\nso high an expense. The resentment of Mr Allworthy, and the injury he\r\nmust do to his quiet, argued strongly against this latter; and lastly,\r\nthe apparent impossibility of his success, even if he would sacrifice\r\nall these considerations to it, came to his assistance; and thus\r\nhonour at last backed with despair, with gratitude to his benefactor,\r\nand with real love to his mistress, got the better of burning desire,\r\nand he resolved rather to quit Sophia, than pursue her to her ruin.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for any who have not felt it, to conceive the glowing\r\nwarmth which filled his breast on the first contemplation of this\r\nvictory over his passion. Pride flattered him so agreeably, that his\r\nmind perhaps enjoyed perfect happiness; but this was only momentary:\r\nSophia soon returned to his imagination, and allayed the joy of his\r\ntriumph with no less bitter pangs than a good-natured general must\r\nfeel, when he surveys the bleeding heaps, at the price of whose blood\r\nhe hath purchased his laurels; for thousands of tender ideas lay\r\nmurdered before our conqueror.\r\n\r\nBeing resolved, however, to pursue the paths of this giant honour, as\r\nthe gigantic poet Lee calls it, he determined to write a farewel\r\nletter to Sophia; and accordingly proceeded to a house not far off,\r\nwhere, being furnished with proper materials, he wrote as follows:--\r\n\r\n “MADAM,\r\n\r\n “When you reflect on the situation in which I write, I am sure your\r\n good-nature will pardon any inconsistency or absurdity which my\r\n letter contains; for everything here flows from a heart so full,\r\n that no language can express its dictates.\r\n\r\n “I have resolved, madam, to obey your commands, in flying for ever\r\n from your dear, your lovely sight. Cruel indeed those commands are;\r\n but it is a cruelty which proceeds from fortune, not from my Sophia.\r\n Fortune hath made it necessary, necessary to your preservation, to\r\n forget there ever was such a wretch as I am.\r\n\r\n “Believe me, I would not hint all my sufferings to you, if I\r\n imagined they could possibly escape your ears. I know the goodness\r\n and tenderness of your heart, and would avoid giving you any of\r\n those pains which you always feel for the miserable. O let nothing,\r\n which you shall hear of my hard fortune, cause a moment's concern;\r\n for, after the loss of you, everything is to me a trifle.\r\n\r\n “O Sophia! it is hard to leave you; it is harder still to desire you\r\n to forget me; yet the sincerest love obliges me to both. Pardon my\r\n conceiving that any remembrance of me can give you disquiet; but if\r\n I am so gloriously wretched, sacrifice me every way to your relief.\r\n Think I never loved you; or think truly how little I deserve you;\r\n and learn to scorn me for a presumption which can never be too\r\n severely punished.--I am unable to say more.--May guardian angels\r\n protect you for ever!”\r\n\r\nHe was now searching his pockets for his wax, but found none, nor\r\nindeed anything else, therein; for in truth he had, in his frantic\r\ndisposition, tossed everything from him, and amongst the rest, his\r\npocket-book, which he had received from Mr Allworthy, which he had\r\nnever opened, and which now first occurred to his memory.\r\n\r\nThe house supplied him with a wafer for his present purpose, with\r\nwhich, having sealed his letter, he returned hastily towards the brook\r\nside, in order to search for the things which he had there lost. In\r\nhis way he met his old friend Black George, who heartily condoled with\r\nhim on his misfortune; for this had already reached his ears, and\r\nindeed those of all the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nJones acquainted the gamekeeper with his loss, and he as readily went\r\nback with him to the brook, where they searched every tuft of grass in\r\nthe meadow, as well where Jones had not been as where he had been; but\r\nall to no purpose, for they found nothing; for, indeed, though the\r\nthings were then in the meadow, they omitted to search the only place\r\nwhere they were deposited; to wit, in the pockets of the said George;\r\nfor he had just before found them, and being luckily apprized of their\r\nvalue, had very carefully put them up for his own use.\r\n\r\nThe gamekeeper having exerted as much diligence in quest of the lost\r\ngoods, as if he had hoped to find them, desired Mr Jones to recollect\r\nif he had been in no other place: “For sure,” said he, “if you had\r\nlost them here so lately, the things must have been here still; for\r\nthis is a very unlikely place for any one to pass by.” And indeed it\r\nwas by great accident that he himself had passed through that field,\r\nin order to lay wires for hares, with which he was to supply a\r\npoulterer at Bath the next morning.\r\n\r\nJones now gave over all hopes of recovering his loss, and almost all\r\nthoughts concerning it, and turning to Black George, asked him\r\nearnestly if he would do him the greatest favour in the world?\r\n\r\nGeorge answered with some hesitation, “Sir, you know you may command\r\nme whatever is in my power, and I heartily wish it was in my power to\r\ndo you any service.” In fact, the question staggered him; for he had,\r\nby selling game, amassed a pretty good sum of money in Mr Western's\r\nservice, and was afraid that Jones wanted to borrow some small matter\r\nof him; but he was presently relieved from his anxiety, by being\r\ndesired to convey a letter to Sophia, which with great pleasure he\r\npromised to do. And indeed I believe there are few favours which he\r\nwould not have gladly conferred on Mr Jones; for he bore as much\r\ngratitude towards him as he could, and was as honest as men who love\r\nmoney better than any other thing in the universe, generally are.\r\n\r\nMrs Honour was agreed by both to be the proper means by which this\r\nletter should pass to Sophia. They then separated; the gamekeeper\r\nreturned home to Mr Western's, and Jones walked to an alehouse at half\r\na mile's distance, to wait for his messenger's return.\r\n\r\nGeorge no sooner came home to his master's house than he met with Mrs\r\nHonour; to whom, having first sounded her with a few previous\r\nquestions, he delivered the letter for her mistress, and received at\r\nthe same time another from her, for Mr Jones; which Honour told him\r\nshe had carried all that day in her bosom, and began to despair of\r\nfinding any means of delivering it.\r\n\r\nThe gamekeeper returned hastily and joyfully to Jones, who, having\r\nreceived Sophia's letter from him, instantly withdrew, and eagerly\r\nbreaking it open, read as follows:--\r\n\r\n “SIR,\r\n\r\n “It is impossible to express what I have felt since I saw you. Your\r\n submitting, on my account, to such cruel insults from my father,\r\n lays me under an obligation I shall ever own. As you know his\r\n temper, I beg you will, for my sake, avoid him. I wish I had any\r\n comfort to send you; but believe this, that nothing but the last\r\n violence shall ever give my hand or heart where you would be sorry\r\n to see them bestowed.”\r\n\r\nJones read this letter a hundred times over, and kissed it a hundred\r\ntimes as often. His passion now brought all tender desires back into\r\nhis mind. He repented that he had writ to Sophia in the manner we have\r\nseen above; but he repented more that he had made use of the interval\r\nof his messenger's absence to write and dispatch a letter to Mr\r\nAllworthy, in which he had faithfully promised and bound himself to\r\nquit all thoughts of his love. However, when his cool reflections\r\nreturned, he plainly perceived that his case was neither mended nor\r\naltered by Sophia's billet, unless to give him some little glimpse of\r\nhope, from her constancy, of some favourable accident hereafter. He\r\ntherefore resumed his resolution, and taking leave of Black George,\r\nset forward to a town about five miles distant, whither he had desired\r\nMr Allworthy, unless he pleased to revoke his sentence, to send his\r\nthings after him."

      "content": "The behaviour of Sophia on the present occasion; which none of her sex\r\nwill blame, who are capable of behaving in the same manner. And the\r\ndiscussion of a knotty point in the court of conscience.\r\n\nSophia had passed the last twenty-four hours in no very desirable\r\nmanner. During a large part of them she had been entertained by her\r\naunt with lectures of prudence, recommending to her the example of the\r\npolite world, where love (so the good lady said) is at present\r\nentirely laughed at, and where women consider matrimony, as men do\r\noffices of public trust, only as the means of making their fortunes,\r\nand of advancing themselves in the world. In commenting on which text\r\nMrs Western had displayed her eloquence during several hours.\r\n\r\nThese sagacious lectures, though little suited either to the taste or\r\ninclination of Sophia, were, however, less irksome to her than her own\r\nthoughts, that formed the entertainment of the night, during which she\r\nnever once closed her eyes.\r\n\r\nBut though she could neither sleep nor rest in her bed, yet, having no\r\navocation from it, she was found there by her father at his return\r\nfrom Allworthy's, which was not till past ten o'clock in the morning.\r\nHe went directly up to her apartment, opened the door, and seeing she\r\nwas not up, cried, “Oh! you are safe then, and I am resolved to keep\r\nyou so.” He then locked the door, and delivered the key to Honour,\r\nhaving first given her the strictest charge, with great promises of\r\nrewards for her fidelity, and most dreadful menaces of punishment in\r\ncase she should betray her trust.\r\n\r\nHonour's orders were, not to suffer her mistress to come out of her\r\nroom without the authority of the squire himself, and to admit none to\r\nher but him and her aunt; but she was herself to attend her with\r\nwhatever Sophia pleased, except only pen, ink, and paper, of which she\r\nwas forbidden the use.\r\n\r\nThe squire ordered his daughter to dress herself and attend him at\r\ndinner; which she obeyed; and having sat the usual time, was again\r\nconducted to her prison.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the gaoler Honour brought her the letter which she\r\nreceived from the gamekeeper. Sophia read it very attentively twice or\r\nthrice over, and then threw herself upon the bed, and burst into a\r\nflood of tears. Mrs Honour expressed great astonishment at this\r\nbehaviour in her mistress; nor could she forbear very eagerly begging\r\nto know the cause of this passion. Sophia made her no answer for some\r\ntime, and then, starting suddenly up, caught her maid by the hand, and\r\ncried, “O Honour! I am undone.” “Marry forbid,” cries Honour: “I wish\r\nthe letter had been burnt before I had brought it to your la'ship. I'm\r\nsure I thought it would have comforted your la'ship, or I would have\r\nseen it at the devil before I would have touched it.” “Honour,” says\r\nSophia, “you are a good girl, and it is vain to attempt concealing\r\nlonger my weakness from you; I have thrown away my heart on a man who\r\nhath forsaken me.” “And is Mr Jones,” answered the maid, “such a\r\nperfidy man?” “He hath taken his leave of me,” says Sophia, “for ever\r\nin that letter. Nay, he hath desired me to forget him. Could he have\r\ndesired that if he had loved me? Could he have borne such a thought?\r\nCould he have written such a word?” “No, certainly, ma'am,” cries\r\nHonour; “and to be sure, if the best man in England was to desire me\r\nto forget him, I'd take him at his word. Marry, come up! I am sure\r\nyour la'ship hath done him too much honour ever to think on him;--a\r\nyoung lady who may take her choice of all the young men in the\r\ncountry. And to be sure, if I may be so presumptuous as to offer my\r\npoor opinion, there is young Mr Blifil, who, besides that he is come\r\nof honest parents, and will be one of the greatest squires all\r\nhereabouts, he is to be sure, in my poor opinion, a more handsomer and\r\na more politer man by half; and besides, he is a young gentleman of a\r\nsober character, and who may defy any of the neighbours to say black\r\nis his eye; he follows no dirty trollops, nor can any bastards be laid\r\nat his door. Forget him, indeed! I thank Heaven I myself am not so\r\nmuch at my last prayers as to suffer any man to bid me forget him\r\ntwice. If the best he that wears a head was for to go for to offer to\r\nsay such an affronting word to me, I would never give him my company\r\nafterwards, if there was another young man in the kingdom. And as I\r\nwas a saying, to be sure, there is young Mr Blifil.” “Name not his\r\ndetested name,” cries Sophia. “Nay, ma'am,” says Honour, “if your\r\nla'ship doth not like him, there be more jolly handsome young men that\r\nwould court your la'ship, if they had but the least encouragement. I\r\ndon't believe there is arrow young gentleman in this county, or in the\r\nnext to it, that if your la'ship was but to look as if you had a mind\r\nto him, would not come about to make his offers directly.” “What a\r\nwretch dost thou imagine me,” cries Sophia, “by affronting my ears\r\nwith such stuff! I detest all mankind.” “Nay, to be sure, ma'am,”\r\n answered Honour, “your la'ship hath had enough to give you a surfeit\r\nof them. To be used ill by such a poor, beggarly, bastardly\r\nfellow.”--“Hold your blasphemous tongue,” cries Sophia: “how dare you\r\nmention his name with disrespect before me? He use me ill? No, his\r\npoor bleeding heart suffered more when he writ the cruel words than\r\nmine from reading them. O! he is all heroic virtue and angelic\r\ngoodness. I am ashamed of the weakness of my own passion, for blaming\r\nwhat I ought to admire. O, Honour! it is my good only which he\r\nconsults. To my interest he sacrifices both himself and me. The\r\napprehension of ruining me hath driven him to despair.” “I am very\r\nglad,” says Honour, “to hear your la'ship takes that into your\r\nconsideration; for to be sure, it must be nothing less than ruin to\r\ngive your mind to one that is turned out of doors, and is not worth a\r\nfarthing in the world.” “Turned out of doors!” cries Sophia hastily:\r\n“how! what dost thou mean?” “Why, to be sure, ma'am, my master no\r\nsooner told Squire Allworthy about Mr Jones having offered to make\r\nlove to your la'ship than the squire stripped him stark naked, and\r\nturned him out of doors!” “Ha!” says Sophia, “I have been the cursed,\r\nwretched cause of his destruction! Turned naked out of doors! Here,\r\nHonour, take all the money I have; take the rings from my fingers.\r\nHere, my watch: carry him all. Go find him immediately.” “For Heaven's\r\nsake, ma'am,” answered Mrs Honour, “do but consider, if my master\r\nshould miss any of these things, I should be made to answer for them.\r\nTherefore let me beg your la'ship not to part with your watch and\r\njewels. Besides, the money, I think, is enough of all conscience; and\r\nas for that, my master can never know anything of the matter.” “Here,\r\nthen,” cries Sophia, “take every farthing I am worth, find him out\r\nimmediately, and give it him. Go, go, lose not a moment.”\r\n\r\nMrs Honour departed according to orders, and finding Black George\r\nbelow-stairs, delivered him the purse, which contained sixteen\r\nguineas, being, indeed, the whole stock of Sophia; for though her\r\nfather was very liberal to her, she was much too generous to be rich.\r\n\r\nBlack George having received the purse, set forward towards the\r\nalehouse; but in the way a thought occurred to him, whether he should\r\nnot detain this money likewise. His conscience, however, immediately\r\nstarted at this suggestion, and began to upbraid him with ingratitude\r\nto his benefactor. To this his avarice answered, That his conscience\r\nshould have considered the matter before, when he deprived poor Jones\r\nof his £500. That having quietly acquiesced in what was of so much\r\ngreater importance, it was absurd, if not downright hypocrisy, to\r\naffect any qualms at this trifle. In return to which, Conscience, like\r\na good lawyer, attempted to distinguish between an absolute breach of\r\ntrust, as here, where the goods were delivered, and a bare concealment\r\nof what was found, as in the former case. Avarice presently treated\r\nthis with ridicule, called it a distinction without a difference, and\r\nabsolutely insisted that when once all pretensions of honour and\r\nvirtue were given up in any one instance, that there was no precedent\r\nfor resorting to them upon a second occasion. In short, poor\r\nConscience had certainly been defeated in the argument, had not Fear\r\nstept in to her assistance, and very strenuously urged that the real\r\ndistinction between the two actions, did not lie in the different\r\ndegrees of honour but of safety: for that the secreting the £500 was a\r\nmatter of very little hazard; whereas the detaining the sixteen\r\nguineas was liable to the utmost danger of discovery.\r\n\r\nBy this friendly aid of Fear, Conscience obtained a compleat victory\r\nin the mind of Black George, and, after making him a few compliments\r\non his honesty, forced him to deliver the money to Jones."

      "content": "A short chapter, containing a short dialogue between Squire Western\r\nand his sister.\r\n\nMrs Western had been engaged abroad all that day. The squire met her\r\nat her return home; and when she enquired after Sophia, he acquainted\r\nher that he had secured her safe enough. “She is locked up in\r\nchamber,” cries he, “and Honour keeps the key.” As his looks were full\r\nof prodigious wisdom and sagacity when he gave his sister this\r\ninformation, it is probable he expected much applause from her for\r\nwhat he had done; but how was he disappointed when, with a most\r\ndisdainful aspect, she cried, “Sure, brother, you are the weakest of\r\nall men. Why will you not confide in me for the management of my\r\nniece? Why will you interpose? You have now undone all that I have\r\nbeen spending my breath in order to bring about. While I have been\r\nendeavouring to fill her mind with maxims of prudence, you have been\r\nprovoking her to reject them. English women, brother, I thank heaven,\r\nare no slaves. We are not to be locked up like the Spanish and Italian\r\nwives. We have as good a right to liberty as yourselves. We are to be\r\nconvinced by reason and persuasion only, and not governed by force. I\r\nhave seen the world, brother, and know what arguments to make use of;\r\nand if your folly had not prevented me, should have prevailed with her\r\nto form her conduct by those rules of prudence and discretion which I\r\nformerly taught her.” “To be sure,” said the squire, “I am always in\r\nthe wrong.” “Brother,” answered the lady, “you are not in the wrong,\r\nunless when you meddle with matters beyond your knowledge. You must\r\nagree that I have seen most of the world; and happy had it been for my\r\nniece if she had not been taken from under my care. It is by living at\r\nhome with you that she hath learnt romantic notions of love and\r\nnonsense.” “You don't imagine, I hope,” cries the squire, “that I have\r\ntaught her any such things.” “Your ignorance, brother,” returned she,\r\n“as the great Milton says, almost subdues my patience.”[*] “D--n\r\nMilton!” answered the squire: “if he had the impudence to say so to my\r\nface, I'd lend him a douse, thof he was never so great a man.\r\nPatience! An you come to that, sister, I have more occasion of\r\npatience, to be used like an overgrown schoolboy, as I am by you. Do\r\nyou think no one hath any understanding, unless he hath been about at\r\ncourt. Pox! the world is come to a fine pass indeed, if we are all\r\nfools, except a parcel of round-heads and Hanover rats. Pox! I hope\r\nthe times are a coming when we shall make fools of them, and every man\r\nshall enjoy his own. That's all, sister; and every man shall enjoy his\r\nown. I hope to zee it, sister, before the Hanover rats have eat up all\r\nour corn, and left us nothing but turneps to feed upon.”--“I protest,\r\nbrother,” cries she, “you are now got beyond my understanding. Your\r\njargon of turneps and Hanover rats is to me perfectly\r\nunintelligible.”--“I believe,” cries he, “you don't care to hear o'em;\r\nbut the country interest may succeed one day or other for all\r\nthat.”--“I wish,” answered the lady, “you would think a little of your\r\ndaughter's interest; for, believe me, she is in greater danger than\r\nthe nation.”--“Just now,” said he, “you chid me for thinking on her,\r\nand would ha' her left to you.”--“And if you will promise to interpose\r\nno more,” answered she, “I will, out of my regard to my niece,\r\nundertake the charge.”--“Well, do then,” said the squire, “for you\r\nknow I always agreed, that women are the properest to manage women.”\r\n\r\n [*] The reader may, perhaps, subdue his own patience, if he searches\r\n for this in Milton.]\r\n\r\nMrs Western then departed, muttering something with an air of disdain,\r\nconcerning women and management of the nation. She immediately\r\nrepaired to Sophia's apartment, who was now, after a day's\r\nconfinement, released again from her captivity.\r\n\nBOOK VII.\r\n\r\nCONTAINING THREE DAYS."

      "content": "A comparison between the world and the stage.\r\n\nThe world hath been often compared to the theatre; and many grave\r\nwriters, as well as the poets, have considered human life as a great\r\ndrama, resembling, in almost every particular, those scenical\r\nrepresentations which Thespis is first reported to have invented, and\r\nwhich have been since received with so much approbation and delight in\r\nall polite countries.\r\n\r\nThis thought hath been carried so far, and is become so general, that\r\nsome words proper to the theatre, and which were at first\r\nmetaphorically applied to the world, are now indiscriminately and\r\nliterally spoken of both; thus stage and scene are by common use grown\r\nas familiar to us, when we speak of life in general, as when we\r\nconfine ourselves to dramatic performances: and when transactions\r\nbehind the curtain are mentioned, St James's is more likely to occur\r\nto our thoughts than Drury-lane.\r\n\r\nIt may seem easy enough to account for all this, by reflecting that\r\nthe theatrical stage is nothing more than a representation, or, as\r\nAristotle calls it, an imitation of what really exists; and hence,\r\nperhaps, we might fairly pay a very high compliment to those who by\r\ntheir writings or actions have been so capable of imitating life, as\r\nto have their pictures in a manner confounded with, or mistaken for,\r\nthe originals.\r\n\r\nBut, in reality, we are not so fond of paying compliments to these\r\npeople, whom we use as children frequently do the instruments of their\r\namusement; and have much more pleasure in hissing and buffeting them,\r\nthan in admiring their excellence. There are many other reasons which\r\nhave induced us to see this analogy between the world and the stage.\r\n\r\nSome have considered the larger part of mankind in the light of\r\nactors, as personating characters no more their own, and to which in\r\nfact they have no better title, than the player hath to be in earnest\r\nthought the king or emperor whom he represents. Thus the hypocrite may\r\nbe said to be a player; and indeed the Greeks called them both by one\r\nand the same name.\r\n\r\nThe brevity of life hath likewise given occasion to this comparison.\r\nSo the immortal Shakespear--\r\n\r\n --Life's a poor player,\r\n That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,\r\n And then is heard no more.\r\n\r\nFor which hackneyed quotation I will make the reader amends by a very\r\nnoble one, which few, I believe, have read. It is taken from a poem\r\ncalled the Deity, published about nine years ago, and long since\r\nburied in oblivion; a proof that good books, no more than good men, do\r\nalways survive the bad.\r\n\r\n From Thee[*] all human actions take their springs,\r\n The rise of empires and the fall of kings!\r\n See the vast Theatre of Time display'd,\r\n While o'er the scene succeeding heroes tread!\r\n With pomp the shining images succeed,\r\n What leaders triumph, and what monarchs bleed!\r\n Perform the parts thy providence assign'd,\r\n Their pride, their passions, to thy ends inclin'd:\r\n Awhile they glitter in the face of day,\r\n Then at thy nod the phantoms pass away;\r\n No traces left of all the busy scene,\r\n But that remembrance says--_The things have been!_\r\n\r\n [*] The Deity.\r\n\r\nIn all these, however, and in every other similitude of life to the\r\ntheatre, the resemblance hath been always taken from the stage only.\r\nNone, as I remember, have at all considered the audience at this great\r\ndrama.\r\n\r\nBut as Nature often exhibits some of her best performances to a very\r\nfull house, so will the behaviour of her spectators no less admit the\r\nabove-mentioned comparison than that of her actors. In this vast\r\ntheatre of time are seated the friend and the critic; here are claps\r\nand shouts, hisses and groans; in short, everything which was ever\r\nseen or heard at the Theatre-Royal.\r\n\r\nLet us examine this in one example; for instance, in the behaviour of\r\nthe great audience on that scene which Nature was pleased to exhibit\r\nin the twelfth chapter of the preceding book, where she introduced\r\nBlack George running away with the £500 from his friend and\r\nbenefactor.\r\n\r\nThose who sat in the world's upper gallery treated that incident, I am\r\nwell convinced, with their usual vociferation; and every term of\r\nscurrilous reproach was most probably vented on that occasion.\r\n\r\nIf we had descended to the next order of spectators, we should have\r\nfound an equal degree of abhorrence, though less of noise and\r\nscurrility; yet here the good women gave Black George to the devil,\r\nand many of them expected every minute that the cloven-footed\r\ngentleman would fetch his own.\r\n\r\nThe pit, as usual, was no doubt divided; those who delight in heroic\r\nvirtue and perfect character objected to the producing such instances\r\nof villany, without punishing them very severely for the sake of\r\nexample. Some of the author's friends cryed, “Look'e, gentlemen, the\r\nman is a villain, but it is nature for all that.” And all the young\r\ncritics of the age, the clerks, apprentices, &c., called it low, and\r\nfell a groaning.\r\n\r\nAs for the boxes, they behaved with their accustomed politeness. Most\r\nof them were attending to something else. Some of those few who\r\nregarded the scene at all, declared he was a bad kind of man; while\r\nothers refused to give their opinion, till they had heard that of the\r\nbest judges.\r\n\r\nNow we, who are admitted behind the scenes of this great theatre of\r\nNature (and no author ought to write anything besides dictionaries and\r\nspelling-books who hath not this privilege), can censure the action,\r\nwithout conceiving any absolute detestation of the person, whom\r\nperhaps Nature may not have designed to act an ill part in all her\r\ndramas; for in this instance life most exactly resembles the stage,\r\nsince it is often the same person who represents the villain and the\r\nheroe; and he who engages your admiration to-day will probably attract\r\nyour contempt to-morrow. As Garrick, whom I regard in tragedy to be\r\nthe greatest genius the world hath ever produced, sometimes\r\ncondescends to play the fool; so did Scipio the Great, and Laelius the\r\nWise, according to Horace, many years ago; nay, Cicero reports them to\r\nhave been “incredibly childish.” These, it is true, played the fool,\r\nlike my friend Garrick, in jest only; but several eminent characters\r\nhave, in numberless instances of their lives, played the fool\r\negregiously in earnest; so far as to render it a matter of some doubt\r\nwhether their wisdom or folly was predominant; or whether they were\r\nbetter intitled to the applause or censure, the admiration or\r\ncontempt, the love or hatred, of mankind.\r\n\r\nThose persons, indeed, who have passed any time behind the scenes of\r\nthis great theatre, and are thoroughly acquainted not only with the\r\nseveral disguises which are there put on, but also with the fantastic\r\nand capricious behaviour of the Passions, who are the managers and\r\ndirectors of this theatre (for as to Reason, the patentee, he is known\r\nto be a very idle fellow and seldom to exert himself), may most\r\nprobably have learned to understand the famous _nil admirari_ of\r\nHorace, or in the English phrase, to stare at nothing.\r\n\r\nA single bad act no more constitutes a villain in life, than a single\r\nbad part on the stage. The passions, like the managers of a playhouse,\r\noften force men upon parts without consulting their judgment, and\r\nsometimes without any regard to their talents. Thus the man, as well\r\nas the player, may condemn what he himself acts; nay, it is common to\r\nsee vice sit as awkwardly on some men, as the character of Iago would\r\non the honest face of Mr William Mills.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, then, the man of candour and of true understanding is\r\nnever hasty to condemn. He can censure an imperfection, or even a\r\nvice, without rage against the guilty party. In a word, they are the\r\nsame folly, the same childishness, the same ill-breeding, and the same\r\nill-nature, which raise all the clamours and uproars both in life and\r\non the stage. The worst of men generally have the words rogue and\r\nvillain most in their mouths, as the lowest of all wretches are the\r\naptest to cry out low in the pit."

      "content": "Containing a conversation which Mr Jones had with himself.\r\n\nJones received his effects from Mr Allworthy's early in the morning,\r\nwith the following answer to his letter:--\r\n\r\n “SIR,\r\n\r\n “I am commanded by my uncle to acquaint you, that as he did not\r\n proceed to those measures he had taken with you, without the\r\n greatest deliberation, and after the fullest evidence of your\r\n unworthiness, so will it be always out of your power to cause the\r\n least alteration in his resolution. He expresses great surprize at\r\n your presumption in saying you have resigned all pretensions to a\r\n young lady, to whom it is impossible you should ever have had any,\r\n her birth and fortune having made her so infinitely your superior.\r\n Lastly, I am commanded to tell you, that the only instance of your\r\n compliance with my uncle's inclinations which he requires, is, your\r\n immediately quitting this country. I cannot conclude this without\r\n offering you my advice, as a Christian, that you would seriously\r\n think of amending your life. That you may be assisted with grace so\r\n to do, will be always the prayer of\r\n\r\n “Your humble servant,\r\n\r\n “W. BLIFIL.”\r\n\r\nMany contending passions were raised in our heroe's mind by this\r\nletter; but the tender prevailed at last over the indignant and\r\nirascible, and a flood of tears came seasonably to his assistance, and\r\npossibly prevented his misfortunes from either turning his head, or\r\nbursting his heart.\r\n\r\nHe grew, however, soon ashamed of indulging this remedy; and starting\r\nup, he cried, “Well, then, I will give Mr Allworthy the only instance\r\nhe requires of my obedience. I will go this moment--but whither?--why,\r\nlet Fortune direct; since there is no other who thinks it of any\r\nconsequence what becomes of this wretched person, it shall be a matter\r\nof equal indifference to myself. Shall I alone regard what no\r\nother--Ha! have I not reason to think there is another?--one whose\r\nvalue is above that of the whole world!--I may, I must imagine my\r\nSophia is not indifferent to what becomes of me. Shall I then leave\r\nthis only friend--and such a friend? Shall I not stay with\r\nher?--Where--how can I stay with her? Have I any hopes of ever seeing\r\nher, though she was as desirous as myself, without exposing her to the\r\nwrath of her father, and to what purpose? Can I think of soliciting\r\nsuch a creature to consent to her own ruin? Shall I indulge any\r\npassion of mine at such a price? Shall I lurk about this country like\r\na thief, with such intentions?--No, I disdain, I detest the thought.\r\nFarewel, Sophia; farewel, most lovely, most beloved--” Here passion\r\nstopped his mouth, and found a vent at his eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd now having taken a resolution to leave the country, he began to\r\ndebate with himself whither he should go. The world, as Milton phrases\r\nit, lay all before him; and Jones, no more than Adam, had any man to\r\nwhom he might resort for comfort or assistance. All his acquaintance\r\nwere the acquaintance of Mr Allworthy; and he had no reason to expect\r\nany countenance from them, as that gentleman had withdrawn his favour\r\nfrom him. Men of great and good characters should indeed be very\r\ncautious how they discard their dependents; for the consequence to the\r\nunhappy sufferer is being discarded by all others.\r\n\r\nWhat course of life to pursue, or to what business to apply himself,\r\nwas a second consideration: and here the prospect was all a melancholy\r\nvoid. Every profession, and every trade, required length of time, and\r\nwhat was worse, money; for matters are so constituted, that “nothing\r\nout of nothing” is not a truer maxim in physics than in politics; and\r\nevery man who is greatly destitute of money, is on that account\r\nentirely excluded from all means of acquiring it.\r\n\r\nAt last the Ocean, that hospitable friend to the wretched, opened her\r\ncapacious arms to receive him; and he instantly resolved to accept her\r\nkind invitation. To express myself less figuratively, he determined to\r\ngo to sea.\r\n\r\nThis thought indeed no sooner suggested itself, than he eagerly\r\nembraced it; and having presently hired horses, he set out for Bristol\r\nto put it in execution.\r\n\r\nBut before we attend him on this expedition, we shall resort awhile to\r\nMr Western's, and see what further happened to the charming Sophia."

      "title": "Chapter iii.",
      "content": "Containing several dialogues.\r\n\nThe morning in which Mr Jones departed, Mrs Western summoned Sophia\r\ninto her apartment; and having first acquainted her that she had\r\nobtained her liberty of her father, she proceeded to read her a long\r\nlecture on the subject of matrimony; which she treated not as a\r\nromantic scheme of happiness arising from love, as it hath been\r\ndescribed by the poets; nor did she mention any of those purposes for\r\nwhich we are taught by divines to regard it as instituted by sacred\r\nauthority; she considered it rather as a fund in which prudent women\r\ndeposit their fortunes to the best advantage, in order to receive a\r\nlarger interest for them than they could have elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs Western had finished, Sophia answered, “That she was very\r\nincapable of arguing with a lady of her aunt's superior knowledge and\r\nexperience, especially on a subject which she had so very little\r\nconsidered, as this of matrimony.”\r\n\r\n“Argue with me, child!” replied the other; “I do not indeed expect it.\r\nI should have seen the world to very little purpose truly, if I am to\r\nargue with one of your years. I have taken this trouble, in order to\r\ninstruct you. The antient philosophers, such as Socrates, Alcibiades,\r\nand others, did not use to argue with their scholars. You are to\r\nconsider me, child, as Socrates, not asking your opinion, but only\r\ninforming you of mine.” From which last words the reader may possibly\r\nimagine, that this lady had read no more of the philosophy of\r\nSocrates, than she had of that of Alcibiades; and indeed we cannot\r\nresolve his curiosity as to this point.\r\n\r\n“Madam,” cries Sophia, “I have never presumed to controvert any\r\nopinion of yours; and this subject, as I said, I have never yet\r\nthought of, and perhaps never may.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, Sophy,” replied the aunt, “this dissimulation with me is very\r\nfoolish. The French shall as soon persuade me that they take foreign\r\ntowns in defence only of their own country, as you can impose on me to\r\nbelieve you have never yet thought seriously of matrimony. How can\r\nyou, child, affect to deny that you have considered of contracting an\r\nalliance, when you so well know I am acquainted with the party with\r\nwhom you desire to contract it?--an alliance as unnatural, and\r\ncontrary to your interest, as a separate league with the French would\r\nbe to the interest of the Dutch! But however, if you have not hitherto\r\nconsidered of this matter, I promise you it is now high time, for my\r\nbrother is resolved immediately to conclude the treaty with Mr Blifil;\r\nand indeed I am a sort of guarantee in the affair, and have promised\r\nyour concurrence.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, madam,” cries Sophia, “this is the only instance in which I\r\nmust disobey both yourself and my father. For this is a match which\r\nrequires very little consideration in me to refuse.”\r\n\r\n“If I was not as great a philosopher as Socrates himself,” returned\r\nMrs Western, “you would overcome my patience. What objection can you\r\nhave to the young gentleman?”\r\n\r\n“A very solid objection, in my opinion,” says Sophia--“I hate him.”\r\n\r\n“Will you never learn a proper use of words?” answered the aunt.\r\n“Indeed, child, you should consult Bailey's Dictionary. It is\r\nimpossible you should hate a man from whom you have received no\r\ninjury. By hatred, therefore, you mean no more than dislike, which is\r\nno sufficient objection against your marrying of him. I have known\r\nmany couples, who have entirely disliked each other, lead very\r\ncomfortable genteel lives. Believe me, child, I know these things\r\nbetter than you. You will allow me, I think, to have seen the world,\r\nin which I have not an acquaintance who would not rather be thought to\r\ndislike her husband than to like him. The contrary is such\r\nout-of-fashion romantic nonsense, that the very imagination of it is\r\nshocking.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, madam,” replied Sophia, “I shall never marry a man I dislike.\r\nIf I promise my father never to consent to any marriage contrary to\r\nhis inclinations, I think I may hope he will never force me into that\r\nstate contrary to my own.”\r\n\r\n“Inclinations!” cries the aunt, with some warmth. “Inclinations! I am\r\nastonished at your assurance. A young woman of your age, and\r\nunmarried, to talk of inclinations! But whatever your inclinations may\r\nbe, my brother is resolved; nay, since you talk of inclinations, I\r\nshall advise him to hasten the treaty. Inclinations!”\r\n\r\nSophia then flung herself upon her knees, and tears began to trickle\r\nfrom her shining eyes. She entreated her aunt, “to have mercy upon\r\nher, and not to resent so cruelly her unwillingness to make herself\r\nmiserable;” often urging, “that she alone was concerned, and that her\r\nhappiness only was at stake.”\r\n\r\nAs a bailiff, when well authorized by his writ, having possessed\r\nhimself of the person of some unhappy debtor, views all his tears\r\nwithout concern; in vain the wretched captive attempts to raise\r\ncompassion; in vain the tender wife bereft of her companion, the\r\nlittle prattling boy, or frighted girl, are mentioned as inducements\r\nto reluctance. The noble bumtrap, blind and deaf to every circumstance\r\nof distress, greatly rises above all the motives to humanity, and into\r\nthe hands of the gaoler resolves to deliver his miserable prey.\r\n\r\nNot less blind to the tears, or less deaf to every entreaty of Sophia\r\nwas the politic aunt, nor less determined was she to deliver over the\r\ntrembling maid into the arms of the gaoler Blifil. She answered with\r\ngreat impetuosity, “So far, madam, from your being concerned alone,\r\nyour concern is the least, or surely the least important. It is the\r\nhonour of your family which is concerned in this alliance; you are\r\nonly the instrument. Do you conceive, mistress, that in an\r\nintermarriage between kingdoms, as when a daughter of France is\r\nmarried into Spain, the princess herself is alone considered in the\r\nmatch? No! it is a match between two kingdoms, rather than between two\r\npersons. The same happens in great families such as ours. The alliance\r\nbetween the families is the principal matter. You ought to have a\r\ngreater regard for the honour of your family than for your own person;\r\nand if the example of a princess cannot inspire you with these noble\r\nthoughts, you cannot surely complain at being used no worse than all\r\nprincesses are used.”\r\n\r\n“I hope, madam,” cries Sophia, with a little elevation of voice, “I\r\nshall never do anything to dishonour my family; but as for Mr Blifil,\r\nwhatever may be the consequence, I am resolved against him, and no\r\nforce shall prevail in his favour.”\r\n\r\nWestern, who had been within hearing during the greater part of the\r\npreceding dialogue, had now exhausted all his patience; he therefore\r\nentered the room in a violent passion, crying, “D--n me then if\r\nshatunt ha'un, d--n me if shatunt, that's all--that's all; d--n me if\r\nshatunt.”\r\n\r\nMrs Western had collected a sufficient quantity of wrath for the use\r\nof Sophia; but she now transferred it all to the squire. “Brother,”\r\n said she, “it is astonishing that you will interfere in a matter\r\nwhich you had totally left to my negotiation. Regard to my family\r\nhath made me take upon myself to be the mediating power, in order to\r\nrectify those mistakes in policy which you have committed in your\r\ndaughter's education. For, brother, it is you--it is your\r\npreposterous conduct which hath eradicated all the seeds that I had\r\nformerly sown in her tender mind. It is you yourself who have taught\r\nher disobedience.”--“Blood!” cries the squire, foaming at the mouth,\r\n“you are enough to conquer the patience of the devil! Have I ever\r\ntaught my daughter disobedience?--Here she stands; speak honestly,\r\ngirl, did ever I bid you be disobedient to me? Have not I done\r\neverything to humour and to gratify you, and to make you obedient to\r\nme? And very obedient to me she was when a little child, before you\r\ntook her in hand and spoiled her, by filling her head with a pack of\r\ncourt notions. Why--why--why--did I not overhear you telling her she\r\nmust behave like a princess? You have made a Whig of the girl; and how\r\nshould her father, or anybody else, expect any obedience from\r\nher?”--“Brother,” answered Mrs Western, with an air of great disdain,\r\n“I cannot express the contempt I have for your politics of all kinds;\r\nbut I will appeal likewise to the young lady herself, whether I have\r\never taught her any principles of disobedience. On the contrary,\r\nniece, have I not endeavoured to inspire you with a true idea of the\r\nseveral relations in which a human creature stands in society? Have I\r\nnot taken infinite pains to show you, that the law of nature hath\r\nenjoined a duty on children to their parents? Have I not told you what\r\nPlato says on that subject?--a subject on which you was so notoriously\r\nignorant when you came first under my care, that I verily believe you\r\ndid not know the relation between a daughter and a father.”--“'Tis a\r\nlie,” answered Western. “The girl is no such fool, as to live to\r\neleven years old without knowing that she was her father's\r\nrelation.”--“O! more than Gothic ignorance,” answered the lady. “And\r\nas for your manners, brother, I must tell you, they deserve a\r\ncane.”--“Why then you may gi' it me, if you think you are able,” cries\r\nthe squire; “nay, I suppose your niece there will be ready enough to\r\nhelp you.”--“Brother,” said Mrs Western, “though I despise you beyond\r\nexpression, yet I shall endure your insolence no longer; so I desire\r\nmy coach may be got ready immediately, for I am resolved to leave your\r\nhouse this very morning.”--“And a good riddance too,” answered he; “I\r\ncan bear your insolence no longer, an you come to that. Blood! it is\r\nalmost enough of itself to make my daughter undervalue my sense, when\r\nshe hears you telling me every minute you despise me.”--“It is\r\nimpossible, it is impossible,” cries the aunt; “no one can undervalue\r\nsuch a boor.”--“Boar,” answered the squire, “I am no boar; no, nor\r\nass; no, nor rat neither, madam. Remember that--I am no rat. I am a\r\ntrue Englishman, and not of your Hanover breed, that have eat up the\r\nnation.”--“Thou art one of those wise men,” cries she, “whose\r\nnonsensical principles have undone the nation; by weakening the hands\r\nof our government at home, and by discouraging our friends and\r\nencouraging our enemies abroad.”--“Ho! are you come back to your\r\npolitics?” cries the squire: “as for those I despise them as much as I\r\ndo a f--t.” Which last words he accompanied and graced with the very\r\naction, which, of all others, was the most proper to it. And whether\r\nit was this word or the contempt exprest for her politics, which most\r\naffected Mrs Western, I will not determine; but she flew into the most\r\nviolent rage, uttered phrases improper to be here related, and\r\ninstantly burst out of the house. Nor did her brother or her niece\r\nthink proper either to stop or to follow her; for the one was so much\r\npossessed by concern, and the other by anger, that they were rendered\r\nalmost motionless.\r\n\r\nThe squire, however, sent after his sister the same holloa which\r\nattends the departure of a hare, when she is first started before the\r\nhounds. He was indeed a great master of this kind of vociferation, and\r\nhad a holla proper for most occasions in life.\r\n\r\nWomen who, like Mrs Western, know the world, and have applied\r\nthemselves to philosophy and politics, would have immediately availed\r\nthemselves of the present disposition of Mr Western's mind, by\r\nthrowing in a few artful compliments to his understanding at the\r\nexpense of his absent adversary; but poor Sophia was all simplicity.\r\nBy which word we do not intend to insinuate to the reader, that she\r\nwas silly, which is generally understood as a synonymous term with\r\nsimple; for she was indeed a most sensible girl, and her understanding\r\nwas of the first rate; but she wanted all that useful art which\r\nfemales convert to so many good purposes in life, and which, as it\r\nrather arises from the heart than from the head, is often the property\r\nof the silliest of women."

      "content": "A picture of a country gentlewoman taken from the life.\r\n\nMr Western having finished his holla, and taken a little breath, began\r\nto lament, in very pathetic terms, the unfortunate condition of men,\r\nwho are, says he, “always whipt in by the humours of some d--n'd b--\r\nor other. I think I was hard run enough by your mother for one man;\r\nbut after giving her a dodge, here's another b-- follows me upon the\r\nfoil; but curse my jacket if I will be run down in this manner by any\r\no'um.”\r\n\r\nSophia never had a single dispute with her father, till this unlucky\r\naffair of Blifil, on any account, except in defence of her mother,\r\nwhom she had loved most tenderly, though she lost her in the eleventh\r\nyear of her age. The squire, to whom that poor woman had been a\r\nfaithful upper-servant all the time of their marriage, had returned\r\nthat behaviour by making what the world calls a good husband. He very\r\nseldom swore at her (perhaps not above once a week) and never beat\r\nher; she had not the least occasion for jealousy, and was perfect\r\nmistress of her time; for she was never interrupted by her husband,\r\nwho was engaged all the morning in his field exercises, and all the\r\nevening with bottle companions. She scarce indeed ever saw him but at\r\nmeals; where she had the pleasure of carving those dishes which she\r\nhad before attended at the dressing. From these meals she retired\r\nabout five minutes after the other servants, having only stayed to\r\ndrink “the king over the water.” Such were, it seems, Mr Western's\r\norders; for it was a maxim with him, that women should come in with\r\nthe first dish, and go out after the first glass. Obedience to these\r\norders was perhaps no difficult task; for the conversation (if it may\r\nbe called so) was seldom such as could entertain a lady. It consisted\r\nchiefly of hallowing, singing, relations of sporting adventures,\r\nb--d--y, and abuse of women, and of the government.\r\n\r\nThese, however, were the only seasons when Mr Western saw his wife;\r\nfor when he repaired to her bed, he was generally so drunk that he\r\ncould not see; and in the sporting season he always rose from her\r\nbefore it was light. Thus was she perfect mistress of her time, and\r\nhad besides a coach and four usually at her command; though unhappily,\r\nindeed, the badness of the neighbourhood, and of the roads, made this\r\nof little use; for none who had set much value on their necks would\r\nhave passed through the one, or who had set any value on their hours,\r\nwould have visited the other. Now to deal honestly with the reader,\r\nshe did not make all the return expected to so much indulgence; for\r\nshe had been married against her will by a fond father, the match\r\nhaving been rather advantageous on her side; for the squire's estate\r\nwas upward of £3000 a year, and her fortune no more than a bare £8000.\r\nHence perhaps she had contracted a little gloominess of temper, for\r\nshe was rather a good servant than a good wife; nor had she always the\r\ngratitude to return the extraordinary degree of roaring mirth, with\r\nwhich the squire received her, even with a good-humoured smile. She\r\nwould, moreover, sometimes interfere with matters which did not\r\nconcern her, as the violent drinking of her husband, which in the\r\ngentlest terms she would take some of the few opportunities he gave\r\nher of remonstrating against. And once in her life she very earnestly\r\nentreated him to carry her for two months to London, which he\r\nperemptorily denied; nay, was angry with his wife for the request ever\r\nafter, being well assured that all the husbands in London are\r\ncuckolds.\r\n\r\nFor this last, and many other good reasons, Western at length heartily\r\nhated his wife; and as he never concealed this hatred before her\r\ndeath, so he never forgot it afterwards; but when anything in the\r\nleast soured him, as a bad scenting day, or a distemper among his\r\nhounds, or any other such misfortune, he constantly vented his spleen\r\nby invectives against the deceased, saying, “If my wife was alive now,\r\nshe would be glad of this.”\r\n\r\nThese invectives he was especially desirous of throwing forth before\r\nSophia; for as he loved her more than he did any other, so he was\r\nreally jealous that she had loved her mother better than him. And this\r\njealousy Sophia seldom failed of heightening on these occasions; for\r\nhe was not contented with violating her ears with the abuse of her\r\nmother, but endeavoured to force an explicit approbation of all this\r\nabuse; with which desire he never could prevail upon her by any\r\npromise or threats to comply.\r\n\r\nHence some of my readers will, perhaps, wonder that the squire had not\r\nhated Sophia as much as he had hated her mother; but I must inform\r\nthem, that hatred is not the effect of love, even through the medium\r\nof jealousy. It is, indeed, very possible for jealous persons to kill\r\nthe objects of their jealousy, but not to hate them. Which sentiment\r\nbeing a pretty hard morsel, and bearing something of the air of a\r\nparadox, we shall leave the reader to chew the cud upon it to the end\r\nof the chapter."

      "content": "The generous behaviour of Sophia towards her aunt.\r\n\nSophia kept silence during the foregoing speech of her father, nor did\r\nshe once answer otherwise than with a sigh; but as he understood none\r\nof the language, or, as he called it, lingo of the eyes, so he was not\r\nsatisfied without some further approbation of his sentiments, which he\r\nnow demanded of his daughter; telling her, in the usual way, “he\r\nexpected she was ready to take the part of everybody against him, as\r\nshe had always done that of the b-- her mother.” Sophia remaining\r\nstill silent, he cryed out, “What, art dumb? why dost unt speak? Was\r\nnot thy mother a d--d b-- to me? answer me that. What, I suppose you\r\ndespise your father too, and don't think him good enough to speak to?”\r\n\r\n“For Heaven's sake, sir,” answered Sophia, “do not give so cruel a\r\nturn to my silence. I am sure I would sooner die than be guilty of any\r\ndisrespect towards you; but how can I venture to speak, when every\r\nword must either offend my dear papa, or convict me of the blackest\r\ningratitude as well as impiety to the memory of the best of mothers;\r\nfor such, I am certain, my mamma was always to me?”\r\n\r\n“And your aunt, I suppose, is the best of sisters too!” replied the\r\nsquire. “Will you be so kind as to allow that she is a b--? I may\r\nfairly insist upon that, I think?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, sir,” says Sophia, “I have great obligations to my aunt. She\r\nhath been a second mother to me.”\r\n\r\n“And a second wife to me too,” returned Western; “so you will take her\r\npart too! You won't confess that she hath acted the part of the vilest\r\nsister in the world?”\r\n\r\n“Upon my word, sir,” cries Sophia, “I must belie my heart wickedly if\r\nI did. I know my aunt and you differ very much in your ways of\r\nthinking; but I have heard her a thousand times express the greatest\r\naffection for you; and I am convinced, so far from her being the worst\r\nsister in the world, there are very few who love a brother better.”\r\n\r\n“The English of all which is,” answered the squire, “that I am in the\r\nwrong. Ay, certainly. Ay, to be sure the woman is in the right, and\r\nthe man in the wrong always.”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, sir,” cries Sophia. “I do not say so.”\r\n\r\n“What don't you say?” answered the father: “you have the impudence to\r\nsay she's in the right: doth it not follow then of course that I am in\r\nthe wrong? And perhaps I am in the wrong to suffer such a Presbyterian\r\nHanoverian b-- to come into my house. She may 'dite me of a plot for\r\nanything I know, and give my estate to the government.”\r\n\r\n“So far, sir, from injuring you or your estate,” says Sophia, “if my\r\naunt had died yesterday, I am convinced she would have left you her\r\nwhole fortune.”\r\n\r\nWhether Sophia intended it or no, I shall not presume to assert; but\r\ncertain it is, these last words penetrated very deep into the ears of\r\nher father, and produced a much more sensible effect than all she had\r\nsaid before. He received the sound with much the same action as a man\r\nreceives a bullet in his head. He started, staggered, and turned pale.\r\nAfter which he remained silent above a minute, and then began in the\r\nfollowing hesitating manner: “Yesterday! she would have left me her\r\nesteate yesterday! would she? Why yesterday, of all the days in the\r\nyear? I suppose if she dies to-morrow, she will leave it to somebody\r\nelse, and perhaps out of the vamily.”--“My aunt, sir,” cries Sophia,\r\n“hath very violent passions, and I can't answer what she may do under\r\ntheir influence.”\r\n\r\n“You can't!” returned the father: “and pray who hath been the occasion\r\nof putting her into those violent passions? Nay, who hath actually put\r\nher into them? Was not you and she hard at it before I came into the\r\nroom? Besides, was not all our quarrel about you? I have not\r\nquarrelled with sister this many years but upon your account; and now\r\nyou would throw the whole blame upon me, as thof I should be the\r\noccasion of her leaving the esteate out o' the vamily. I could have\r\nexpected no better indeed; this is like the return you make to all the\r\nrest of my fondness.”\r\n\r\n“I beseech you then,” cries Sophia, “upon my knees I beseech you, if I\r\nhave been the unhappy occasion of this difference, that you will\r\nendeavour to make it up with my aunt, and not suffer her to leave your\r\nhouse in this violent rage of anger: she is a very good-natured woman,\r\nand a few civil words will satisfy her. Let me entreat you, sir.”\r\n\r\n“So I must go and ask pardon for your fault, must I?” answered\r\nWestern. “You have lost the hare, and I must draw every way to find\r\nher again? Indeed, if I was certain”--Here he stopt, and Sophia\r\nthrowing in more entreaties, at length prevailed upon him; so that\r\nafter venting two or three bitter sarcastical expressions against his\r\ndaughter, he departed as fast as he could to recover his sister,\r\nbefore her equipage could be gotten ready.\r\n\r\nSophia then returned to her chamber of mourning, where she indulged\r\nherself (if the phrase may be allowed me) in all the luxury of tender\r\ngrief. She read over more than once the letter which she had received\r\nfrom Jones; her muff too was used on this occasion; and she bathed\r\nboth these, as well as herself, with her tears. In this situation the\r\nfriendly Mrs Honour exerted her utmost abilities to comfort her\r\nafflicted mistress. She ran over the names of many young gentlemen:\r\nand having greatly commended their parts and persons, assured Sophia\r\nthat she might take her choice of any. These methods must have\r\ncertainly been used with some success in disorders of the like kind,\r\nor so skilful a practitioner as Mrs Honour would never have ventured\r\nto apply them; nay, I have heard that the college of chambermaids hold\r\nthem to be as sovereign remedies as any in the female dispensary; but\r\nwhether it was that Sophia's disease differed inwardly from those\r\ncases with which it agreed in external symptoms, I will not assert;\r\nbut, in fact, the good waiting-woman did more harm than good, and at\r\nlast so incensed her mistress (which was no easy matter) that with an\r\nangry voice she dismissed her from her presence."

      "content": "Containing great variety of matter.\r\n\nThe squire overtook his sister just as she was stepping into the\r\ncoach, and partly by force, and partly by solicitations, prevailed\r\nupon her to order her horses back into their quarters. He succeeded in\r\nthis attempt without much difficulty; for the lady was, as we have\r\nalready hinted, of a most placable disposition, and greatly loved her\r\nbrother, though she despised his parts, or rather his little knowledge\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nPoor Sophia, who had first set on foot this reconciliation, was now\r\nmade the sacrifice to it. They both concurred in their censures on her\r\nconduct; jointly declared war against her, and directly proceeded to\r\ncounsel, how to carry it on in the most vigorous manner. For this\r\npurpose, Mrs Western proposed not only an immediate conclusion of the\r\ntreaty with Allworthy, but as immediately to carry it into execution;\r\nsaying, “That there was no other way to succeed with her niece, but by\r\nviolent methods, which she was convinced Sophia had not sufficient\r\nresolution to resist. By violent,” says she, “I mean rather, hasty\r\nmeasures; for as to confinement or absolute force, no such things must\r\nor can be attempted. Our plan must be concerted for a surprize, and\r\nnot for a storm.”\r\n\r\nThese matters were resolved on, when Mr Blifil came to pay a visit to\r\nhis mistress. The squire no sooner heard of his arrival, than he stept\r\naside, by his sister's advice, to give his daughter orders for the\r\nproper reception of her lover: which he did with the most bitter\r\nexecrations and denunciations of judgment on her refusal.\r\n\r\nThe impetuosity of the squire bore down all before him; and Sophia, as\r\nher aunt very wisely foresaw, was not able to resist him. She agreed,\r\ntherefore, to see Blifil, though she had scarce spirits or strength\r\nsufficient to utter her assent. Indeed, to give a peremptory denial to\r\na father whom she so tenderly loved, was no easy task. Had this\r\ncircumstance been out of the case, much less resolution than what she\r\nwas really mistress of, would, perhaps, have served her; but it is no\r\nunusual thing to ascribe those actions entirely to fear, which are in\r\na great measure produced by love.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance, therefore, of her father's peremptory command, Sophia\r\nnow admitted Mr Blifil's visit. Scenes like this, when painted at\r\nlarge, afford, as we have observed, very little entertainment to the\r\nreader. Here, therefore, we shall strictly adhere to a rule of Horace;\r\nby which writers are directed to pass over all those matters which\r\nthey despair of placing in a shining light;--a rule, we conceive, of\r\nexcellent use as well to the historian as to the poet; and which, if\r\nfollowed, must at least have this good effect, that many a great evil\r\n(for so all great books are called) would thus be reduced to a small\r\none.\r\n\r\nIt is possible the great art used by Blifil at this interview would\r\nhave prevailed on Sophia to have made another man in his circumstances\r\nher confident, and to have revealed the whole secret of her heart to\r\nhim; but she had contracted so ill an opinion of this young gentleman,\r\nthat she was resolved to place no confidence in him; for simplicity,\r\nwhen set on its guard, is often a match for cunning. Her behaviour to\r\nhim, therefore, was entirely forced, and indeed such as is generally\r\nprescribed to virgins upon the second formal visit from one who is\r\nappointed for their husband.\r\n\r\nBut though Blifil declared himself to the squire perfectly satisfied\r\nwith his reception; yet that gentleman, who, in company with his\r\nsister, had overheard all, was not so well pleased. He resolved, in\r\npursuance of the advice of the sage lady, to push matters as forward\r\nas possible; and addressing himself to his intended son-in-law in the\r\nhunting phrase, he cried, after a loud holla, “Follow her, boy, follow\r\nher; run in, run in; that's it, honeys. Dead, dead, dead. Never be\r\nbashful, nor stand shall I, shall I? Allworthy and I can finish all\r\nmatters between us this afternoon, and let us ha' the wedding\r\nto-morrow.”\r\n\r\nBlifil having conveyed the utmost satisfaction into his countenance,\r\nanswered, “As there is nothing, sir, in this world which I so eagerly\r\ndesire as an alliance with your family, except my union with the most\r\namiable and deserving Sophia, you may easily imagine how impatient I\r\nmust be to see myself in possession of my two highest wishes. If I\r\nhave not therefore importuned you on this head, you will impute it\r\nonly to my fear of offending the lady, by endeavouring to hurry on so\r\nblessed an event faster than a strict compliance with all the rules of\r\ndecency and decorum will permit. But if, by your interest, sir, she\r\nmight be induced to dispense with any formalities--”\r\n\r\n“Formalities! with a pox!” answered the squire. “Pooh, all stuff and\r\nnonsense! I tell thee, she shall ha' thee to-morrow: you will know the\r\nworld better hereafter, when you come to my age. Women never gi' their\r\nconsent, man, if they can help it, 'tis not the fashion. If I had\r\nstayed for her mother's consent, I might have been a batchelor to this\r\nday.--To her, to her, co to her, that's it, you jolly dog. I tell thee\r\nshat ha' her to-morrow morning.”\r\n\r\nBlifil suffered himself to be overpowered by the forcible rhetoric of\r\nthe squire; and it being agreed that Western should close with\r\nAllworthy that very afternoon, the lover departed home, having first\r\nearnestly begged that no violence might be offered to the lady by this\r\nhaste, in the same manner as a popish inquisitor begs the lay power to\r\ndo no violence to the heretic delivered over to it, and against whom\r\nthe church hath passed sentence.\r\n\r\nAnd, to say the truth, Blifil had passed sentence against Sophia; for,\r\nhowever pleased he had declared himself to Western with his reception,\r\nhe was by no means satisfied, unless it was that he was convinced of\r\nthe hatred and scorn of his mistress: and this had produced no less\r\nreciprocal hatred and scorn in him. It may, perhaps, be asked, Why\r\nthen did he not put an immediate end to all further courtship? I\r\nanswer, for that very reason, as well as for several others equally\r\ngood, which we shall now proceed to open to the reader.\r\n\r\nThough Mr Blifil was not of the complexion of Jones, nor ready to eat\r\nevery woman he saw; yet he was far from being destitute of that\r\nappetite which is said to be the common property of all animals. With\r\nthis, he had likewise that distinguishing taste, which serves to\r\ndirect men in their choice of the object or food of their several\r\nappetites; and this taught him to consider Sophia as a most delicious\r\nmorsel, indeed to regard her with the same desires which an ortolan\r\ninspires into the soul of an epicure. Now the agonies which affected\r\nthe mind of Sophia, rather augmented than impaired her beauty; for her\r\ntears added brightness to her eyes, and her breasts rose higher with\r\nher sighs. Indeed, no one hath seen beauty in its highest lustre who\r\nhath never seen it in distress. Blifil therefore looked on this human\r\nortolan with greater desire than when he viewed her last; nor was his\r\ndesire at all lessened by the aversion which he discovered in her to\r\nhimself. On the contrary, this served rather to heighten the pleasure\r\nhe proposed in rifling her charms, as it added triumph to lust; nay,\r\nhe had some further views, from obtaining the absolute possession of\r\nher person, which we detest too much even to mention; and revenge\r\nitself was not without its share in the gratifications which he\r\npromised himself. The rivalling poor Jones, and supplanting him in her\r\naffections, added another spur to his pursuit, and promised another\r\nadditional rapture to his enjoyment.\r\n\r\nBesides all these views, which to some scrupulous persons may seem to\r\nsavour too much of malevolence, he had one prospect, which few readers\r\nwill regard with any great abhorrence. And this was the estate of Mr\r\nWestern; which was all to be settled on his daughter and her issue;\r\nfor so extravagant was the affection of that fond parent, that,\r\nprovided his child would but consent to be miserable with the husband\r\nhe chose, he cared not at what price he purchased him.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons Mr Blifil was so desirous of the match that he\r\nintended to deceive Sophia, by pretending love to her; and to deceive\r\nher father and his own uncle, by pretending he was beloved by her. In\r\ndoing this he availed himself of the piety of Thwackum, who held, that\r\nif the end proposed was religious (as surely matrimony is), it\r\nmattered not how wicked were the means. As to other occasions, he used\r\nto apply the philosophy of Square, which taught, that the end was\r\nimmaterial, so that the means were fair and consistent with moral\r\nrectitude. To say truth, there were few occurrences in life on which\r\nhe could not draw advantage from the precepts of one or other of those\r\ngreat masters.\r\n\r\nLittle deceit was indeed necessary to be practised on Mr Western; who\r\nthought the inclinations of his daughter of as little consequence as\r\nBlifil himself conceived them to be; but as the sentiments of Mr\r\nAllworthy were of a very different kind, so it was absolutely\r\nnecessary to impose on him. In this, however, Blifil was so well\r\nassisted by Western, that he succeeded without difficulty; for as Mr\r\nAllworthy had been assured by her father that Sophia had a proper\r\naffection for Blifil, and that all which he had suspected concerning\r\nJones was entirely false, Blifil had nothing more to do than to\r\nconfirm these assertions; which he did with such equivocations, that\r\nhe preserved a salvo for his conscience; and had the satisfaction of\r\nconveying a lie to his uncle, without the guilt of telling one. When\r\nhe was examined touching the inclinations of Sophia by Allworthy, who\r\nsaid, “He would on no account be accessary to forcing a young lady\r\ninto a marriage contrary to her own will;” he answered, “That the real\r\nsentiments of young ladies were very difficult to be understood; that\r\nher behaviour to him was full as forward as he wished it, and that if\r\nhe could believe her father, she had all the affection for him which\r\nany lover could desire. As for Jones,” said he, “whom I am loth to\r\ncall villain, though his behaviour to you, sir, sufficiently justifies\r\nthe appellation, his own vanity, or perhaps some wicked views, might\r\nmake him boast of a falsehood; for if there had been any reality in\r\nMiss Western's love to him, the greatness of her fortune would never\r\nhave suffered him to desert her, as you are well informed he hath.\r\nLastly, sir, I promise you I would not myself, for any consideration,\r\nno, not for the whole world, consent to marry this young lady, if I\r\nwas not persuaded she had all the passion for me which I desire she\r\nshould have.”\r\n\r\nThis excellent method of conveying a falsehood with the heart only,\r\nwithout making the tongue guilty of an untruth, by the means of\r\nequivocation and imposture, hath quieted the conscience of many a\r\nnotable deceiver; and yet, when we consider that it is Omniscience on\r\nwhich these endeavour to impose, it may possibly seem capable of\r\naffording only a very superficial comfort; and that this artful and\r\nrefined distinction between communicating a lie, and telling one, is\r\nhardly worth the pains it costs them.\r\n\r\nAllworthy was pretty well satisfied with what Mr Western and Mr Blifil\r\ntold him: and the treaty was now, at the end of two days, concluded.\r\nNothing then remained previous to the office of the priest, but the\r\noffice of the lawyers, which threatened to take up so much time, that\r\nWestern offered to bind himself by all manner of covenants, rather\r\nthan defer the happiness of the young couple. Indeed, he was so very\r\nearnest and pressing, that an indifferent person might have concluded\r\nhe was more a principal in this match than he really was; but this\r\neagerness was natural to him on all occasions: and he conducted every\r\nscheme he undertook in such a manner, as if the success of that alone\r\nwas sufficient to constitute the whole happiness of his life.\r\n\r\nThe joint importunities of both father and son-in-law would probably\r\nhave prevailed on Mr Allworthy, who brooked but ill any delay of\r\ngiving happiness to others, had not Sophia herself prevented it, and\r\ntaken measures to put a final end to the whole treaty, and to rob both\r\nchurch and law of those taxes which these wise bodies have thought\r\nproper to receive from the propagation of the human species in a\r\nlawful manner. Of which in the next chapter."

      "content": "A strange resolution of Sophia, and a more strange stratagem of Mrs\r\nHonour.\r\n\nThough Mrs Honour was principally attached to her own interest, she\r\nwas not without some little attachment to Sophia. To say truth, it was\r\nvery difficult for any one to know that young lady without loving her.\r\nShe no sooner therefore heard a piece of news, which she imagined to\r\nbe of great importance to her mistress, than, quite forgetting the\r\nanger which she had conceived two days before, at her unpleasant\r\ndismission from Sophia's presence, she ran hastily to inform her of\r\nthe news.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of her discourse was as abrupt as her entrance into the\r\nroom. “O dear ma'am!” says she, “what doth your la'ship think? To be\r\nsure I am frightened out of my wits; and yet I thought it my duty to\r\ntell your la'ship, though perhaps it may make you angry, for we\r\nservants don't always know what will make our ladies angry; for, to be\r\nsure, everything is always laid to the charge of a servant. When our\r\nladies are out of humour, to be sure we must be scolded; and to be\r\nsure I should not wonder if your la'ship should be out of humour; nay,\r\nit must surprize you certainly, ay, and shock you too.”--“Good Honour,\r\nlet me know it without any longer preface,” says Sophia; “there are\r\nfew things, I promise you, which will surprize, and fewer which will\r\nshock me.”--“Dear ma'am,” answered Honour, “to be sure, I overheard my\r\nmaster talking to parson Supple about getting a licence this very\r\nafternoon; and to be sure I heard him say, your la'ship should be\r\nmarried to-morrow morning.” Sophia turned pale at these words, and\r\nrepeated eagerly, “To-morrow morning!”--“Yes, ma'am,” replied the\r\ntrusty waiting-woman, “I will take my oath I heard my master say\r\nso.”--“Honour,” says Sophia, “you have both surprized and shocked me\r\nto such a degree that I have scarce any breath or spirits left. What\r\nis to be done in my dreadful situation?”--“I wish I was able to advise\r\nyour la'ship,” says she. “Do advise me,” cries Sophia; “pray, dear\r\nHonour, advise me. Think what you would attempt if it was your own\r\ncase.”--“Indeed, ma'am,” cries Honour, “I wish your la'ship and I\r\ncould change situations; that is, I mean without hurting your la'ship;\r\nfor to be sure I don't wish you so bad as to be a servant; but because\r\nthat if so be it was my case, I should find no manner of difficulty in\r\nit; for, in my poor opinion, young Squire Blifil is a charming, sweet,\r\nhandsome man.”--“Don't mention such stuff,” cries Sophia. “Such\r\nstuff!” repeated Honour; “why, there. Well, to be sure, what's one\r\nman's meat is another man's poison, and the same is altogether as true\r\nof women.”--“Honour,” says Sophia, “rather than submit to be the wife\r\nof that contemptible wretch, I would plunge a dagger into my\r\nheart.”--“O lud! ma'am!” answered the other, “I am sure you frighten\r\nme out of my wits now. Let me beseech your la'ship not to suffer such\r\nwicked thoughts to come into your head. O lud! to be sure I tremble\r\nevery inch of me. Dear ma'am, consider, that to be denied Christian\r\nburial, and to have your corpse buried in the highway, and a stake\r\ndrove through you, as farmer Halfpenny was served at Ox Cross; and, to\r\nbe sure, his ghost hath walked there ever since, for several people\r\nhave seen him. To be sure it can be nothing but the devil which can\r\nput such wicked thoughts into the head of anybody; for certainly it is\r\nless wicked to hurt all the world than one's own dear self; and so I\r\nhave heard said by more parsons than one. If your la'ship hath such a\r\nviolent aversion, and hates the young gentleman so very bad, that you\r\ncan't bear to think of going into bed to him; for to be sure there may\r\nbe such antipathies in nature, and one had lieverer touch a toad than\r\nthe flesh of some people.”--\r\n\r\nSophia had been too much wrapt in contemplation to pay any great\r\nattention to the foregoing excellent discourse of her maid;\r\ninterrupting her therefore, without making any answer to it, she said,\r\n“Honour, I am come to a resolution. I am determined to leave my\r\nfather's house this very night; and if you have the friendship for me\r\nwhich you have often professed, you will keep me company.”--“That I\r\nwill, ma'am, to the world's end,” answered Honour; “but I beg your\r\nla'ship to consider the consequence before you undertake any rash\r\naction. Where can your la'ship possibly go?”--“There is,” replied\r\nSophia, “a lady of quality in London, a relation of mine, who spent\r\nseveral months with my aunt in the country; during all which time she\r\ntreated me with great kindness, and expressed so much pleasure in my\r\ncompany, that she earnestly desired my aunt to suffer me to go with\r\nher to London. As she is a woman of very great note, I shall easily\r\nfind her out, and I make no doubt of being very well and kindly\r\nreceived by her.”--“I would not have your la'ship too confident of\r\nthat,” cries Honour; “for the first lady I lived with used to invite\r\npeople very earnestly to her house; but if she heard afterwards they\r\nwere coming, she used to get out of the way. Besides, though this lady\r\nwould be very glad to see your la'ship, as to be sure anybody would be\r\nglad to see your la'ship, yet when she hears your la'ship is run away\r\nfrom my master--” “You are mistaken, Honour,” says Sophia: “she looks\r\nupon the authority of a father in a much lower light than I do; for\r\nshe pressed me violently to go to London with her, and when I refused\r\nto go without my father's consent, she laughed me to scorn, called me\r\nsilly country girl, and said, I should make a pure loving wife, since\r\nI could be so dutiful a daughter. So I have no doubt but she will both\r\nreceive me and protect me too, till my father, finding me out of his\r\npower, can be brought to some reason.”\r\n\r\n“Well, but, ma'am,” answered Honour, “how doth your la'ship think of\r\nmaking your escape? Where will you get any horses or conveyance? For\r\nas for your own horse, as all the servants know a little how matters\r\nstand between my master and your la'ship, Robin will be hanged before\r\nhe will suffer it to go out of the stable without my master's express\r\norders.” “I intend to escape,” said Sophia, “by walking out of the\r\ndoors when they are open. I thank Heaven my legs are very able to\r\ncarry me. They have supported me many a long evening”--“Yes, to be\r\nsure,” cries Honour, “I will follow your la'ship through the world;\r\nbut your la'ship had almost as good be alone: for I should not be able\r\nto defend you, if any robbers, or other villains, should meet with\r\nyou. Nay, I should be in as horrible a fright as your la'ship; for to\r\nbe certain, they would ravish us both. Besides, ma'am, consider how\r\ncold the nights are now; we shall be frozen to death.”--“A good brisk\r\npace,” answered Sophia, “will preserve us from the cold; and if you\r\ncannot defend me from a villain, Honour, I will defend you; for I will\r\ntake a pistol with me. There are two always charged in the\r\nhall.”--“Dear ma'am, you frighten me more and more,” cries Honour:\r\n“sure your la'ship would not venture to fire it off! I had rather run\r\nany chance than your la'ship should do that.”--“Why so?” says Sophia,\r\nsmiling; “would not you, Honour, fire a pistol at any one who should\r\nattack your virtue?”--“To be sure, ma'am,” cries Honour, “one's virtue\r\nis a dear thing, especially to us poor servants; for it is our\r\nlivelihood, as a body may say: yet I mortally hate fire-arms; for so\r\nmany accidents happen by them.”--“Well, well,” says Sophia, “I believe\r\nI may ensure your virtue at a very cheap rate, without carrying any\r\narms with us; for I intend to take horses at the very first town we\r\ncome to, and we shall hardly be attacked in our way thither. Look'ee,\r\nHonour, I am resolved to go; and if you will attend me, I promise you\r\nI will reward you to the very utmost of my power.”\r\n\r\nThis last argument had a stronger effect on Honour than all the\r\npreceding. And since she saw her mistress so determined, she desisted\r\nfrom any further dissuasions. They then entered into a debate on ways\r\nand means of executing their project. Here a very stubborn difficulty\r\noccurred, and this was the removal of their effects, which was much\r\nmore easily got over by the mistress than by the maid; for when a lady\r\nhath once taken a resolution to run to a lover, or to run from him,\r\nall obstacles are considered as trifles. But Honour was inspired by no\r\nsuch motive; she had no raptures to expect, nor any terrors to shun;\r\nand besides the real value of her clothes, in which consisted a great\r\npart of her fortune, she had a capricious fondness for several gowns,\r\nand other things; either because they became her, or because they were\r\ngiven her by such a particular person; because she had bought them\r\nlately, or because she had had them long; or for some other reasons\r\nequally good; so that she could not endure the thoughts of leaving the\r\npoor things behind her exposed to the mercy of Western, who, she\r\ndoubted not, would in his rage make them suffer martyrdom.\r\n\r\nThe ingenious Mrs Honour having applied all her oratory to dissuade\r\nher mistress from her purpose, when she found her positively\r\ndetermined, at last started the following expedient to remove her\r\nclothes, viz., to get herself turned out of doors that very evening.\r\nSophia highly approved this method, but doubted how it might be\r\nbrought about. “O, ma'am,” cries Honour, “your la'ship may trust that\r\nto me; we servants very well know how to obtain this favour of our\r\nmasters and mistresses; though sometimes, indeed, where they owe us\r\nmore wages than they can readily pay, they will put up with all our\r\naffronts, and will hardly take any warning we can give them; but the\r\nsquire is none of those; and since your la'ship is resolved upon\r\nsetting out to-night, I warrant I get discharged this afternoon.” It\r\nwas then resolved that she should pack up some linen and a night-gown\r\nfor Sophia, with her own things; and as for all her other clothes, the\r\nyoung lady abandoned them with no more remorse than the sailor feels\r\nwhen he throws over the goods of others, in order to save his own\r\nlife."

      "content": "Containing scenes of altercation, of no very uncommon kind.\r\n\nMrs Honour had scarce sooner parted from her young lady, than\r\nsomething (for I would not, like the old woman in Quevedo, injure the\r\ndevil by any false accusation, and possibly he might have no hand in\r\nit)--but something, I say, suggested itself to her, that by\r\nsacrificing Sophia and all her secrets to Mr Western, she might\r\nprobably make her fortune. Many considerations urged this discovery.\r\nThe fair prospect of a handsome reward for so great and acceptable a\r\nservice to the squire, tempted her avarice; and again, the danger of\r\nthe enterprize she had undertaken; the uncertainty of its success;\r\nnight, cold, robbers, ravishers, all alarmed her fears. So forcibly\r\ndid all these operate upon her, that she was almost determined to go\r\ndirectly to the squire, and to lay open the whole affair. She was,\r\nhowever, too upright a judge to decree on one side, before she had\r\nheard the other. And here, first, a journey to London appeared very\r\nstrongly in support of Sophia. She eagerly longed to see a place in\r\nwhich she fancied charms short only of those which a raptured saint\r\nimagines in heaven. In the next place, as she knew Sophia to have much\r\nmore generosity than her master, so her fidelity promised her a\r\ngreater reward than she could gain by treachery. She then\r\ncross-examined all the articles which had raised her fears on the\r\nother side, and found, on fairly sifting the matter, that there was\r\nvery little in them. And now both scales being reduced to a pretty\r\neven balance, her love to her mistress being thrown into the scale of\r\nher integrity, made that rather preponderate, when a circumstance\r\nstruck upon her imagination which might have had a dangerous effect,\r\nhad its whole weight been fairly put into the other scale. This was\r\nthe length of time which must intervene before Sophia would be able to\r\nfulfil her promises; for though she was intitled to her mother's\r\nfortune at the death of her father, and to the sum of £3000 left her\r\nby an uncle when she came of age; yet these were distant days, and\r\nmany accidents might prevent the intended generosity of the young\r\nlady; whereas the rewards she might expect from Mr Western were\r\nimmediate. But while she was pursuing this thought the good genius of\r\nSophia, or that which presided over the integrity of Mrs Honour, or\r\nperhaps mere chance, sent an accident in her way, which at once\r\npreserved her fidelity, and even facilitated the intended business.\r\n\r\nMrs Western's maid claimed great superiority over Mrs Honour on\r\nseveral accounts. First, her birth was higher; for her great-grandmother\r\nby the mother's side was a cousin, not far removed, to an Irish peer.\r\nSecondly, her wages were greater. And lastly, she had been at London,\r\nand had of consequence seen more of the world. She had always behaved,\r\ntherefore, to Mrs Honour with that reserve, and had always exacted of\r\nher those marks of distinction, which every order of females preserves\r\nand requires in conversation with those of an inferior order. Now as\r\nHonour did not at all times agree with this doctrine, but would\r\nfrequently break in upon the respect which the other demanded, Mrs\r\nWestern's maid was not at all pleased with her company; indeed, she\r\nearnestly longed to return home to the house of her mistress, where\r\nshe domineered at will over all the other servants. She had been\r\ngreatly, therefore, disappointed in the morning, when Mrs Western had\r\nchanged her mind on the very point of departure; and had been in what\r\nis vulgarly called a glouting humour ever since.\r\n\r\nIn this humour, which was none of the sweetest, she came into the room\r\nwhere Honour was debating with herself in the manner we have above\r\nrelated. Honour no sooner saw her, than she addressed her in the\r\nfollowing obliging phrase: “Soh, madam, I find we are to have the\r\npleasure of your company longer, which I was afraid the quarrel\r\nbetween my master and your lady would have robbed us of.”--“I don't\r\nknow, madam,” answered the other, “what you mean by we and us. I\r\nassure you I do not look on any of the servants in this house to be\r\nproper company for me. I am company, I hope, for their betters every\r\nday in the week. I do not speak on your account, Mrs Honour; for you\r\nare a civilized young woman; and when you have seen a little more of\r\nthe world, I should not be ashamed to walk with you in St James's\r\nPark.”--“Hoity toity!” cries Honour, “madam is in her airs, I protest.\r\nMrs Honour, forsooth! sure, madam, you might call me by my sir-name;\r\nfor though my lady calls me Honour, I have a sir-name as well as other\r\nfolks. Ashamed to walk with me, quotha! marry, as good as yourself, I\r\nhope.”--“Since you make such a return to my civility,” said the other,\r\n“I must acquaint you, Mrs Honour, that you are not so good as me. In\r\nthe country, indeed, one is obliged to take up with all kind of\r\ntrumpery; but in town I visit none but the women of women of quality.\r\nIndeed, Mrs Honour, there is some difference, I hope, between you and\r\nme.”--“I hope so too,” answered Honour: “there is some difference in\r\nour ages, and--I think in our persons.” Upon speaking which last\r\nwords, she strutted by Mrs Western's maid with the most provoking air\r\nof contempt; turning up her nose, tossing her head, and violently\r\nbrushing the hoop of her competitor with her own. The other lady put\r\non one of her most malicious sneers, and said, “Creature! you are\r\nbelow my anger; and it is beneath me to give ill words to such an\r\naudacious saucy trollop; but, hussy, I must tell you, your breeding\r\nshows the meanness of your birth as well as of your education; and\r\nboth very properly qualify you to be the mean serving-woman of a\r\ncountry girl.”--“Don't abuse my lady,” cries Honour: “I won't take\r\nthat of you; she's as much better than yours as she is younger, and\r\nten thousand times more handsomer.”\r\n\r\nHere ill luck, or rather good luck, sent Mrs Western to see her maid\r\nin tears, which began to flow plentifully at her approach; and of\r\nwhich being asked the reason by her mistress, she presently acquainted\r\nher that her tears were occasioned by the rude treatment of that\r\ncreature there--meaning Honour. “And, madam,” continued she, “I could\r\nhave despised all she said to me; but she hath had the audacity to\r\naffront your ladyship, and to call you ugly--Yes, madam, she called\r\nyou ugly old cat to my face. I could not bear to hear your ladyship\r\ncalled ugly.”--“Why do you repeat her impudence so often?” said Mrs\r\nWestern. And then turning to Mrs Honour, she asked her “How she had\r\nthe assurance to mention her name with disrespect?”--“Disrespect,\r\nmadam!” answered Honour; “I never mentioned your name at all: I said\r\nsomebody was not as handsome as my mistress, and to be sure you know\r\nthat as well as I.”--“Hussy,” replied the lady, “I will make such a\r\nsaucy trollop as yourself know that I am not a proper subject of your\r\ndiscourse. And if my brother doth not discharge you this moment, I\r\nwill never sleep in his house again. I will find him out, and have you\r\ndischarged this moment.”--“Discharged!” cries Honour; “and suppose I\r\nam: there are more places in the world than one. Thank Heaven, good\r\nservants need not want places; and if you turn away all who do not\r\nthink you handsome, you will want servants very soon; let me tell you\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\nMrs Western spoke, or rather thundered, in answer; but as she was\r\nhardly articulate, we cannot be very certain of the identical words;\r\nwe shall therefore omit inserting a speech which at best would not\r\ngreatly redound to her honour. She then departed in search of her\r\nbrother, with a countenance so full of rage, that she resembled one of\r\nthe furies rather than a human creature.\r\n\r\nThe two chambermaids being again left alone, began a second bout at\r\naltercation, which soon produced a combat of a more active kind. In\r\nthis the victory belonged to the lady of inferior rank, but not\r\nwithout some loss of blood, of hair, and of lawn and muslin."

      "content": "The wise demeanour of Mr Western in the character of a magistrate. A\r\nhint to justices of peace, concerning the necessary qualifications of\r\na clerk; with extraordinary instances of paternal madness and filial\r\naffection.\r\n\nLogicians sometimes prove too much by an argument, and politicians\r\noften overreach themselves in a scheme. Thus had it like to have\r\nhappened to Mrs Honour, who, instead of recovering the rest of her\r\nclothes, had like to have stopped even those she had on her back from\r\nescaping; for the squire no sooner heard of her having abused his\r\nsister, than he swore twenty oaths he would send her to Bridewell.\r\n\r\nMrs Western was a very good-natured woman, and ordinarily of a\r\nforgiving temper. She had lately remitted the trespass of a\r\nstage-coachman, who had overturned her post-chaise into a ditch; nay,\r\nshe had even broken the law, in refusing to prosecute a highwayman who\r\nhad robbed her, not only of a sum of money, but of her ear-rings; at\r\nthe same time d--ning her, and saying, “Such handsome b--s as you\r\ndon't want jewels to set them off, and be d--n'd to you.” But now, so\r\nuncertain are our tempers, and so much do we at different times differ\r\nfrom ourselves, she would hear of no mitigation; nor could all the\r\naffected penitence of Honour, nor all the entreaties of Sophia for her\r\nown servant, prevail with her to desist from earnestly desiring her\r\nbrother to execute justiceship (for it was indeed a syllable more than\r\njustice) on the wench.\r\n\r\nBut luckily the clerk had a qualification, which no clerk to a justice\r\nof peace ought ever to be without, namely, some understanding in the\r\nlaw of this realm. He therefore whispered in the ear of the justice\r\nthat he would exceed his authority by committing the girl to\r\nBridewell, as there had been no attempt to break the peace; “for I am\r\nafraid, sir,” says he, “you cannot legally commit any one to Bridewell\r\nonly for ill-breeding.”\r\n\r\nIn matters of high importance, particularly in cases relating to the\r\ngame, the justice was not always attentive to these admonitions of his\r\nclerk; for, indeed, in executing the laws under that head, many\r\njustices of peace suppose they have a large discretionary power, by\r\nvirtue of which, under the notion of searching for and taking away\r\nengines for the destruction of the game, they often commit trespasses,\r\nand sometimes felony, at their pleasure.\r\n\r\nBut this offence was not of quite so high a nature, nor so dangerous\r\nto the society. Here, therefore, the justice behaved with some\r\nattention to the advice of his clerk; for, in fact, he had already had\r\ntwo informations exhibited against him in the King's Bench, and had no\r\ncuriosity to try a third.\r\n\r\nThe squire, therefore, putting on a most wise and significant\r\ncountenance, after a preface of several hums and hahs, told his\r\nsister, that upon more mature deliberation, he was of opinion, that\r\n“as there was no breaking up of the peace, such as the law,” says he,\r\n“calls breaking open a door, or breaking a hedge, or breaking a head,\r\nor any such sort of breaking, the matter did not amount to a felonious\r\nkind of a thing, nor trespasses, nor damages, and, therefore, there\r\nwas no punishment in the law for it.”\r\n\r\nMrs Western said, “she knew the law much better; that she had known\r\nservants very severely punished for affronting their masters;” and\r\nthen named a certain justice of the peace in London, “who,” she said,\r\n“would commit a servant to Bridewell at any time when a master or\r\nmistress desired it.”\r\n\r\n“Like enough,” cries the squire; “it may be so in London; but the law\r\nis different in the country.” Here followed a very learned dispute\r\nbetween the brother and sister concerning the law, which we would\r\ninsert, if we imagined many of our readers could understand it. This\r\nwas, however, at length referred by both parties to the clerk, who\r\ndecided it in favour of the magistrate; and Mrs Western was, in the\r\nend, obliged to content herself with the satisfaction of having Honour\r\nturned away; to which Sophia herself very readily and cheerfully\r\nconsented.\r\n\r\nThus Fortune, after having diverted herself, according to custom, with\r\ntwo or three frolicks, at last disposed all matters to the advantage\r\nof our heroine; who indeed succeeded admirably well in her deceit,\r\nconsidering it was the first she had ever practised. And, to say the\r\ntruth, I have often concluded, that the honest part of mankind would\r\nbe much too hard for the knavish, if they could bring themselves to\r\nincur the guilt, or thought it worth their while to take the trouble.\r\n\r\nHonour acted her part to the utmost perfection. She no sooner saw\r\nherself secure from all danger of Bridewell, a word which had raised\r\nmost horrible ideas in her mind, than she resumed those airs which her\r\nterrors before had a little abated; and laid down her place, with as\r\nmuch affectation of content, and indeed of contempt, as was ever\r\npractised at the resignation of places of much greater importance. If\r\nthe reader pleases, therefore, we chuse rather to say she\r\nresigned--which hath, indeed, been always held a synonymous expression\r\nwith being turned out, or turned away.\r\n\r\nMr Western ordered her to be very expeditious in packing; for his\r\nsister declared she would not sleep another night under the same roof\r\nwith so impudent a slut. To work therefore she went, and that so\r\nearnestly, that everything was ready early in the evening; when,\r\nhaving received her wages, away packed bag and baggage, to the great\r\nsatisfaction of every one, but of none more than of Sophia; who,\r\nhaving appointed her maid to meet her at a certain place not far from\r\nthe house, exactly at the dreadful and ghostly hour of twelve, began\r\nto prepare for her own departure.\r\n\r\nBut first she was obliged to give two painful audiences, the one to\r\nher aunt, and the other to her father. In these Mrs Western herself\r\nbegan to talk to her in a more peremptory stile than before: but her\r\nfather treated her in so violent and outrageous a manner, that he\r\nfrightened her into an affected compliance with his will; which so\r\nhighly pleased the good squire, that he changed his frowns into\r\nsmiles, and his menaces into promises: he vowed his whole soul was\r\nwrapt in hers; that her consent (for so he construed the words, “You\r\nknow, sir, I must not, nor can, refuse to obey any absolute command of\r\nyours”) had made him the happiest of mankind. He then gave her a large\r\nbank-bill to dispose of in any trinkets she pleased, and kissed and\r\nembraced her in the fondest manner, while tears of joy trickled from\r\nthose eyes which a few moments before had darted fire and rage against\r\nthe dear object of all his affection.\r\n\r\nInstances of this behaviour in parents are so common, that the reader,\r\nI doubt not, will be very little astonished at the whole conduct of Mr\r\nWestern. If he should, I own I am not able to account for it; since\r\nthat he loved his daughter most tenderly, is, I think, beyond dispute.\r\nSo indeed have many others, who have rendered their children most\r\ncompletely miserable by the same conduct; which, though it is almost\r\nuniversal in parents, hath always appeared to me to be the most\r\nunaccountable of all the absurdities which ever entered into the brain\r\nof that strange prodigious creature man.\r\n\r\nThe latter part of Mr Western's behaviour had so strong an effect on\r\nthe tender heart of Sophia, that it suggested a thought to her, which\r\nnot all the sophistry of her politic aunt, nor all the menaces of her\r\nfather, had ever once brought into her head. She reverenced her father\r\nso piously, and loved him so passionately, that she had scarce ever\r\nfelt more pleasing sensations, than what arose from the share she\r\nfrequently had of contributing to his amusement, and sometimes,\r\nperhaps, to higher gratifications; for he never could contain the\r\ndelight of hearing her commended, which he had the satisfaction of\r\nhearing almost every day of her life. The idea, therefore, of the\r\nimmense happiness she should convey to her father by her consent to\r\nthis match, made a strong impression on her mind. Again, the extreme\r\npiety of such an act of obedience worked very forcibly, as she had a\r\nvery deep sense of religion. Lastly, when she reflected how much she\r\nherself was to suffer, being indeed to become little less than a\r\nsacrifice, or a martyr, to filial love and duty, she felt an agreeable\r\ntickling in a certain little passion, which though it bears no\r\nimmediate affinity either to religion or virtue, is often so kind as\r\nto lend great assistance in executing the purposes of both.\r\n\r\nSophia was charmed with the contemplation of so heroic an action, and\r\nbegan to compliment herself with much premature flattery, when Cupid,\r\nwho lay hid in her muff, suddenly crept out, and like Punchinello in a\r\npuppet-show, kicked all out before him. In truth (for we scorn to\r\ndeceive our reader, or to vindicate the character of our heroine by\r\nascribing her actions to supernatural impulse) the thoughts of her\r\nbeloved Jones, and some hopes (however distant) in which he was very\r\nparticularly concerned, immediately destroyed all which filial love,\r\npiety, and pride had, with their joint endeavours, been labouring to\r\nbring about.\r\n\r\nBut before we proceed any farther with Sophia, we must now look back\r\nto Mr Jones."

      "content": "Containing several matters, natural enough perhaps, but low.\r\n\nThe reader will be pleased to remember, that we left Mr Jones, in the\r\nbeginning of this book, on his road to Bristol; being determined to\r\nseek his fortune at sea, or rather, indeed, to fly away from his\r\nfortune on shore.\r\n\r\nIt happened (a thing not very unusual), that the guide who undertook\r\nto conduct him on his way, was unluckily unacquainted with the road;\r\nso that having missed his right track, and being ashamed to ask\r\ninformation, he rambled about backwards and forwards till night came\r\non, and it began to grow dark. Jones suspecting what had happened,\r\nacquainted the guide with his apprehensions; but he insisted on it,\r\nthat they were in the right road, and added, it would be very strange\r\nif he should not know the road to Bristol; though, in reality, it\r\nwould have been much stranger if he had known it, having never past\r\nthrough it in his life before.\r\n\r\nJones had not such implicit faith in his guide, but that on their\r\narrival at a village he inquired of the first fellow he saw, whether\r\nthey were in the road to Bristol. “Whence did you come?” cries the\r\nfellow. “No matter,” says Jones, a little hastily; “I want to know if\r\nthis be the road to Bristol?”--“The road to Bristol!” cries the\r\nfellow, scratching his head: “why, measter, I believe you will hardly\r\nget to Bristol this way to-night.”--“Prithee, friend, then,” answered\r\nJones, “do tell us which is the way.”--“Why, measter,” cries the\r\nfellow, “you must be come out of your road the Lord knows whither; for\r\nthick way goeth to Glocester.”--“Well, and which way goes to Bristol?”\r\n said Jones. “Why, you be going away from Bristol,” answered the\r\nfellow. “Then,” said Jones, “we must go back again?”--“Ay, you must,”\r\n said the fellow. “Well, and when we come back to the top of the hill,\r\nwhich way must we take?”--“Why, you must keep the strait road.”--“But\r\nI remember there are two roads, one to the right and the other to the\r\nleft.”--“Why, you must keep the right-hand road, and then gu strait\r\nvorwards; only remember to turn vurst to your right, and then to your\r\nleft again, and then to your right, and that brings you to the\r\nsquire's; and then you must keep strait vorwards, and turn to the\r\nleft.”\r\n\r\nAnother fellow now came up, and asked which way the gentlemen were\r\ngoing; of which being informed by Jones, he first scratched his head,\r\nand then leaning upon a pole he had in his hand, began to tell him,\r\n“That he must keep the right-hand road for about a mile, or a mile and\r\na half, or such a matter, and then he must turn short to the left,\r\nwhich would bring him round by Measter Jin Bearnes's.”--“But which is\r\nMr John Bearnes's?” says Jones. “O Lord!” cries the fellow, “why,\r\ndon't you know Measter Jin Bearnes? Whence then did you come?”\r\n\r\nThese two fellows had almost conquered the patience of Jones, when a\r\nplain well-looking man (who was indeed a Quaker) accosted him thus:\r\n“Friend, I perceive thou hast lost thy way; and if thou wilt take my\r\nadvice, thou wilt not attempt to find it to-night. It is almost dark,\r\nand the road is difficult to hit; besides, there have been several\r\nrobberies committed lately between this and Bristol. Here is a very\r\ncreditable good house just by, where thou may'st find good\r\nentertainment for thyself and thy cattle till morning.” Jones, after a\r\nlittle persuasion, agreed to stay in this place till the morning, and\r\nwas conducted by his friend to the public-house.\r\n\r\nThe landlord, who was a very civil fellow, told Jones, “He hoped he\r\nwould excuse the badness of his accommodation; for that his wife was\r\ngone from home, and had locked up almost everything, and carried the\r\nkeys along with her.” Indeed the fact was, that a favourite daughter\r\nof hers was just married, and gone that morning home with her husband;\r\nand that she and her mother together had almost stript the poor man of\r\nall his goods, as well as money; for though he had several children,\r\nthis daughter only, who was the mother's favourite, was the object of\r\nher consideration; and to the humour of this one child she would with\r\npleasure have sacrificed all the rest, and her husband into the\r\nbargain.\r\n\r\nThough Jones was very unfit for any kind of company, and would have\r\npreferred being alone, yet he could not resist the importunities of\r\nthe honest Quaker; who was the more desirous of sitting with him, from\r\nhaving remarked the melancholy which appeared both in his countenance\r\nand behaviour; and which the poor Quaker thought his conversation\r\nmight in some measure relieve.\r\n\r\nAfter they had past some time together, in such a manner that my\r\nhonest friend might have thought himself at one of his silent\r\nmeetings, the Quaker began to be moved by some spirit or other,\r\nprobably that of curiosity, and said, “Friend, I perceive some sad\r\ndisaster hath befallen thee; but pray be of comfort. Perhaps thou hast\r\nlost a friend. If so, thou must consider we are all mortal. And why\r\nshouldst thou grieve, when thou knowest thy grief will do thy friend\r\nno good? We are all born to affliction. I myself have my sorrows as\r\nwell as thee, and most probably greater sorrows. Though I have a clear\r\nestate of £100 a year, which is as much as I want, and I have a\r\nconscience, I thank the Lord, void of offence; my constitution is\r\nsound and strong, and there is no man can demand a debt of me, nor\r\naccuse me of an injury; yet, friend, I should be concerned to think\r\nthee as miserable as myself.”\r\n\r\nHere the Quaker ended with a deep sigh; and Jones presently answered,\r\n“I am very sorry, sir, for your unhappiness, whatever is the occasion\r\nof it.”--“Ah! friend,” replied the Quaker, “one only daughter is the\r\noccasion; one who was my greatest delight upon earth, and who within\r\nthis week is run away from me, and is married against my consent. I\r\nhad provided her a proper match, a sober man and one of substance; but\r\nshe, forsooth, would chuse for herself, and away she is gone with a\r\nyoung fellow not worth a groat. If she had been dead, as I suppose thy\r\nfriend is, I should have been happy.”--“That is very strange, sir,”\r\n said Jones. “Why, would it not be better for her to be dead, than to\r\nbe a beggar?” replied the Quaker: “for, as I told you, the fellow is\r\nnot worth a groat; and surely she cannot expect that I shall ever give\r\nher a shilling. No, as she hath married for love, let her live on love\r\nif she can; let her carry her love to market, and see whether any one\r\nwill change it into silver, or even into halfpence.”--“You know your\r\nown concerns best, sir,” said Jones. “It must have been,” continued\r\nthe Quaker, “a long premeditated scheme to cheat me: for they have\r\nknown one another from their infancy; and I always preached to her\r\nagainst love, and told her a thousand times over it was all folly and\r\nwickedness. Nay, the cunning slut pretended to hearken to me, and to\r\ndespise all wantonness of the flesh; and yet at last broke out at a\r\nwindow two pair of stairs: for I began, indeed, a little to suspect\r\nher, and had locked her up carefully, intending the very next morning\r\nto have married her up to my liking. But she disappointed me within a\r\nfew hours, and escaped away to the lover of her own chusing; who lost\r\nno time, for they were married and bedded and all within an hour. But\r\nit shall be the worst hour's work for them both that ever they did;\r\nfor they may starve, or beg, or steal together, for me. I will never\r\ngive either of them a farthing.” Here Jones starting up cried, “I\r\nreally must be excused: I wish you would leave me.”--“Come, come,\r\nfriend,” said the Quaker, “don't give way to concern. You see there\r\nare other people miserable besides yourself.”--“I see there are\r\nmadmen, and fools, and villains in the world,” cries Jones. “But let\r\nme give you a piece of advice: send for your daughter and son-in-law\r\nhome, and don't be yourself the only cause of misery to one you\r\npretend to love.”--“Send for her and her husband home!” cries the\r\nQuaker loudly; “I would sooner send for the two greatest enemies I\r\nhave in the world!”--“Well, go home yourself, or where you please,”\r\n said Jones, “for I will sit no longer in such company.”--“Nay,\r\nfriend,” answered the Quaker, “I scorn to impose my company on any\r\none.” He then offered to pull money from his pocket, but Jones pushed\r\nhim with some violence out of the room.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the Quaker's discourse had so deeply affected Jones,\r\nthat he stared very wildly all the time he was speaking. This the\r\nQuaker had observed, and this, added to the rest of his behaviour,\r\ninspired honest Broadbrim with a conceit, that his companion was in\r\nreality out of his senses. Instead of resenting the affront,\r\ntherefore, the Quaker was moved with compassion for his unhappy\r\ncircumstances; and having communicated his opinion to the landlord, he\r\ndesired him to take great care of his guest, and to treat him with the\r\nhighest civility.\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” says the landlord, “I shall use no such civility towards\r\nhim; for it seems, for all his laced waistcoat there, he is no more a\r\ngentleman than myself, but a poor parish bastard, bred up at a great\r\nsquire's about thirty miles off, and now turned out of doors (not for\r\nany good to be sure). I shall get him out of my house as soon as\r\npossible. If I do lose my reckoning, the first loss is always the\r\nbest. It is not above a year ago that I lost a silver spoon.”\r\n\r\n“What dost thou talk of a parish bastard, Robin?” answered the Quaker.\r\n“Thou must certainly be mistaken in thy man.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” replied Robin; “the guide, who knows him very well, told\r\nit me.” For, indeed, the guide had no sooner taken his place at the\r\nkitchen fire, than he acquainted the whole company with all he knew or\r\nhad ever heard concerning Jones.\r\n\r\nThe Quaker was no sooner assured by this fellow of the birth and low\r\nfortune of Jones, than all compassion for him vanished; and the honest\r\nplain man went home fired with no less indignation than a duke would\r\nhave felt at receiving an affront from such a person.\r\n\r\nThe landlord himself conceived an equal disdain for his guest; so that\r\nwhen Jones rung the bell in order to retire to bed, he was acquainted\r\nthat he could have no bed there. Besides disdain of the mean condition\r\nof his guest, Robin entertained violent suspicion of his intentions,\r\nwhich were, he supposed, to watch some favourable opportunity of\r\nrobbing the house. In reality, he might have been very well eased of\r\nthese apprehensions, by the prudent precautions of his wife and\r\ndaughter, who had already removed everything which was not fixed to\r\nthe freehold; but he was by nature suspicious, and had been more\r\nparticularly so since the loss of his spoon. In short, the dread of\r\nbeing robbed totally absorbed the comfortable consideration that he\r\nhad nothing to lose.\r\n\r\nJones being assured that he could have no bed, very contentedly betook\r\nhimself to a great chair made with rushes, when sleep, which had\r\nlately shunned his company in much better apartments, generously paid\r\nhim a visit in his humble cell.\r\n\r\nAs for the landlord, he was prevented by his fears from retiring to\r\nrest. He returned therefore to the kitchen fire, whence he could\r\nsurvey the only door which opened into the parlour, or rather hole,\r\nwhere Jones was seated; and as for the window to that room, it was\r\nimpossible for any creature larger than a cat to have made his escape\r\nthrough it."

      "content": "The adventure of a company of soldiers.\r\n\nThe landlord having taken his seat directly opposite to the door of\r\nthe parlour, determined to keep guard there the whole night. The guide\r\nand another fellow remained long on duty with him, though they neither\r\nknew his suspicions, nor had any of their own. The true cause of their\r\nwatching did, indeed, at length, put an end to it; for this was no\r\nother than the strength and goodness of the beer, of which having\r\ntippled a very large quantity, they grew at first very noisy and\r\nvociferous, and afterwards fell both asleep.\r\n\r\nBut it was not in the power of liquor to compose the fears of Robin.\r\nHe continued still waking in his chair, with his eyes fixed stedfastly\r\non the door which led into the apartment of Mr Jones, till a violent\r\nthundering at his outward gate called him from his seat, and obliged\r\nhim to open it; which he had no sooner done, than his kitchen was\r\nimmediately full of gentlemen in red coats, who all rushed upon him in\r\nas tumultuous a manner as if they intended to take his little castle\r\nby storm.\r\n\r\nThe landlord was now forced from his post to furnish his numerous\r\nguests with beer, which they called for with great eagerness; and upon\r\nhis second or third return from the cellar, he saw Mr Jones standing\r\nbefore the fire in the midst of the soldiers; for it may easily be\r\nbelieved, that the arrival of so much good company should put an end\r\nto any sleep, unless that from which we are to be awakened only by the\r\nlast trumpet.\r\n\r\nThe company having now pretty well satisfied their thirst, nothing\r\nremained but to pay the reckoning, a circumstance often productive of\r\nmuch mischief and discontent among the inferior rank of gentry, who\r\nare apt to find great difficulty in assessing the sum, with exact\r\nregard to distributive justice, which directs that every man shall pay\r\naccording to the quantity which he drinks. This difficulty occurred\r\nupon the present occasion; and it was the greater, as some gentlemen\r\nhad, in their extreme hurry, marched off, after their first draught,\r\nand had entirely forgot to contribute anything towards the said\r\nreckoning.\r\n\r\nA violent dispute now arose, in which every word may be said to have\r\nbeen deposed upon oath; for the oaths were at least equal to all the\r\nother words spoken. In this controversy the whole company spoke\r\ntogether, and every man seemed wholly bent to extenuate the sum which\r\nfell to his share; so that the most probable conclusion which could be\r\nforeseen was, that a large portion of the reckoning would fall to the\r\nlandlord's share to pay, or (what is much the same thing) would remain\r\nunpaid.\r\n\r\nAll this while Mr Jones was engaged in conversation with the serjeant;\r\nfor that officer was entirely unconcerned in the present dispute,\r\nbeing privileged by immemorial custom from all contribution.\r\n\r\nThe dispute now grew so very warm that it seemed to draw towards a\r\nmilitary decision, when Jones, stepping forward, silenced all their\r\nclamours at once, by declaring that he would pay the whole reckoning,\r\nwhich indeed amounted to no more than three shillings and fourpence.\r\n\r\nThis declaration procured Jones the thanks and applause of the whole\r\ncompany. The terms honourable, noble, and worthy gentleman, resounded\r\nthrough the room; nay, my landlord himself began to have a better\r\nopinion of him, and almost to disbelieve the account which the guide\r\nhad given.\r\n\r\nThe serjeant had informed Mr Jones that they were marching against the\r\nrebels, and expected to be commanded by the glorious Duke of\r\nCumberland. By which the reader may perceive (a circumstance which we\r\nhave not thought necessary to communicate before) that this was the\r\nvery time when the late rebellion was at the highest; and indeed the\r\nbanditti were now marched into England, intending, as it was thought,\r\nto fight the king's forces, and to attempt pushing forward to the\r\nmetropolis.\r\n\r\nJones had some heroic ingredients in his composition, and was a hearty\r\nwell-wisher to the glorious cause of liberty, and of the Protestant\r\nreligion. It is no wonder, therefore, that in circumstances which\r\nwould have warranted a much more romantic and wild undertaking, it\r\nshould occur to him to serve as a volunteer in this expedition.\r\n\r\nOur commanding officer had said all in his power to encourage and\r\npromote this good disposition, from the first moment he had been\r\nacquainted with it. He now proclaimed the noble resolution aloud,\r\nwhich was received with great pleasure by the whole company, who all\r\ncried out, “God bless King George and your honour;” and then added,\r\nwith many oaths, “We will stand by you both to the last drops of our\r\nblood.”\r\n\r\nThe gentleman who had been all night tippling at the alehouse, was\r\nprevailed on by some arguments which a corporal had put into his\r\nhands, to undertake the same expedition. And now the portmanteau\r\nbelonging to Mr Jones being put up in the baggage-cart, the forces\r\nwere about to move forwards; when the guide, stepping up to Jones,\r\nsaid, “Sir, I hope you will consider that the horses have been kept\r\nout all night, and we have travelled a great ways out of our way.”\r\n Jones was surprized at the impudence of this demand, and acquainted\r\nthe soldiers with the merits of his cause, who were all unanimous in\r\ncondemning the guide for his endeavours to put upon a gentleman. Some\r\nsaid, he ought to be tied neck and heels; others that he deserved to\r\nrun the gantlope; and the serjeant shook his cane at him, and wished\r\nhe had him under his command, swearing heartily he would make an\r\nexample of him.\r\n\r\nJones contented himself however with a negative punishment, and walked\r\noff with his new comrades, leaving the guide to the poor revenge of\r\ncursing and reviling him; in which latter the landlord joined, saying,\r\n“Ay, ay, he is a pure one, I warrant you. A pretty gentleman, indeed,\r\nto go for a soldier! He shall wear a laced wastecoat truly. It is an\r\nold proverb and a true one, all is not gold that glisters. I am glad\r\nmy house is well rid of him.”\r\n\r\nAll that day the serjeant and the young soldier marched together; and\r\nthe former, who was an arch fellow, told the latter many entertaining\r\nstories of his campaigns, though in reality he had never made any; for\r\nhe was but lately come into the service, and had, by his own\r\ndexterity, so well ingratiated himself with his officers, that he had\r\npromoted himself to a halberd; chiefly indeed by his merit in\r\nrecruiting, in which he was most excellently well skilled.\r\n\r\nMuch mirth and festivity passed among the soldiers during their march.\r\nIn which the many occurrences that had passed at their last quarters\r\nwere remembered, and every one, with great freedom, made what jokes he\r\npleased on his officers, some of which were of the coarser kind, and\r\nvery near bordering on scandal. This brought to our heroe's mind the\r\ncustom which he had read of among the Greeks and Romans, of indulging,\r\non certain festivals and solemn occasions, the liberty to slaves, of\r\nusing an uncontrouled freedom of speech towards their masters.\r\n\r\nOur little army, which consisted of two companies of foot, were now\r\narrived at the place where they were to halt that evening. The\r\nserjeant then acquainted his lieutenant, who was the commanding\r\nofficer, that they had picked up two fellows in that day's march, one\r\nof which, he said, was as fine a man as ever he saw (meaning the\r\ntippler), for that he was near six feet, well proportioned, and\r\nstrongly limbed; and the other (meaning Jones) would do well enough\r\nfor the rear rank.\r\n\r\nThe new soldiers were now produced before the officer, who having\r\nexamined the six-feet man, he being first produced, came next to\r\nsurvey Jones: at the first sight of whom, the lieutenant could not\r\nhelp showing some surprize; for besides that he was very well dressed,\r\nand was naturally genteel, he had a remarkable air of dignity in his\r\nlook, which is rarely seen among the vulgar, and is indeed not\r\ninseparably annexed to the features of their superiors.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said the lieutenant, “my serjeant informed me that you are\r\ndesirous of enlisting in the company I have at present under my\r\ncommand; if so, sir, we shall very gladly receive a gentleman who\r\npromises to do much honour to the company by bearing arms in it.”\r\n\r\nJones answered: “That he had not mentioned anything of enlisting\r\nhimself; that he was most zealously attached to the glorious cause for\r\nwhich they were going to fight, and was very desirous of serving as a\r\nvolunteer;” concluding with some compliments to the lieutenant, and\r\nexpressing the great satisfaction he should have in being under his\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant returned his civility, commended his resolution, shook\r\nhim by the hand, and invited him to dine with himself and the rest of\r\nthe officers."

      "content": "The adventure of a company of officers.\r\n\nThe lieutenant, whom we mentioned in the preceding chapter, and who\r\ncommanded this party, was now near sixty years of age. He had entered\r\nvery young into the army, and had served in the capacity of an ensign\r\nat the battle of Tannieres; here he had received two wounds, and had\r\nso well distinguished himself, that he was by the Duke of Marlborough\r\nadvanced to be a lieutenant, immediately after that battle.\r\n\r\nIn this commission he had continued ever since, viz., near forty\r\nyears; during which time he had seen vast numbers preferred over his\r\nhead, and had now the mortification to be commanded by boys, whose\r\nfathers were at nurse when he first entered into the service.\r\n\r\nNor was this ill success in his profession solely owing to his having\r\nno friends among the men in power. He had the misfortune to incur the\r\ndispleasure of his colonel, who for many years continued in the\r\ncommand of this regiment. Nor did he owe the implacable ill-will which\r\nthis man bore him to any neglect or deficiency as an officer, nor\r\nindeed to any fault in himself; but solely to the indiscretion of his\r\nwife, who was a very beautiful woman, and who, though she was\r\nremarkably fond of her husband, would not purchase his preferment at\r\nthe expense of certain favours which the colonel required of her.\r\n\r\nThe poor lieutenant was more peculiarly unhappy in this, that while he\r\nfelt the effects of the enmity of his colonel, he neither knew, nor\r\nsuspected, that he really bore him any; for he could not suspect an\r\nill-will for which he was not conscious of giving any cause; and his\r\nwife, fearing what her husband's nice regard to his honour might have\r\noccasioned, contented herself with preserving her virtue without\r\nenjoying the triumphs of her conquest.\r\n\r\nThis unfortunate officer (for so I think he may be called) had many\r\ngood qualities besides his merit in his profession; for he was a\r\nreligious, honest, good-natured man; and had behaved so well in his\r\ncommand, that he was highly esteemed and beloved not only by the\r\nsoldiers of his own company, but by the whole regiment.\r\n\r\nThe other officers who marched with him were a French lieutenant, who\r\nhad been long enough out of France to forget his own language, but not\r\nlong enough in England to learn ours, so that he really spoke no\r\nlanguage at all, and could barely make himself understood on the most\r\nordinary occasions. There were likewise two ensigns, both very young\r\nfellows; one of whom had been bred under an attorney, and the other\r\nwas son to the wife of a nobleman's butler.\r\n\r\nAs soon as dinner was ended, Jones informed the company of the\r\nmerriment which had passed among the soldiers upon their march; “and\r\nyet,” says he, “notwithstanding all their vociferation, I dare swear\r\nthey will behave more like Grecians than Trojans when they come to the\r\nenemy.”--“Grecians and Trojans!” says one of the ensigns, “who the\r\ndevil are they? I have heard of all the troops in Europe, but never of\r\nany such as these.”\r\n\r\n“Don't pretend to more ignorance than you have, Mr Northerton,” said\r\nthe worthy lieutenant. “I suppose you have heard of the Greeks and\r\nTrojans, though perhaps you never read Pope's Homer; who, I remember,\r\nnow the gentleman mentions it, compares the march of the Trojans to\r\nthe cackling of geese, and greatly commends the silence of the\r\nGrecians. And upon my honour there is great justice in the cadet's\r\nobservation.”\r\n\r\n“Begar, me remember dem ver well,” said the French lieutenant: “me ave\r\nread them at school in dans Madam Daciere, des Greek, des Trojan, dey\r\nfight for von woman--ouy, ouy, me ave read all dat.”\r\n\r\n“D--n Homo with all my heart,” says Northerton; “I have the marks of\r\nhim on my a-- yet. There's Thomas, of our regiment, always carries a\r\nHomo in his pocket; d--n me, if ever I come at it, if I don't burn it.\r\nAnd there's Corderius, another d--n'd son of a whore, that hath got me\r\nmany a flogging.”\r\n\r\n“Then you have been at school, Mr Northerton?” said the lieutenant.\r\n\r\n“Ay, d--n me, have I,” answered he; “the devil take my father for\r\nsending me thither! The old put wanted to make a parson of me, but\r\nd--n me, thinks I to myself, I'll nick you there, old cull; the devil\r\na smack of your nonsense shall you ever get into me. There's Jemmy\r\nOliver, of our regiment, he narrowly escaped being a pimp too, and\r\nthat would have been a thousand pities; for d--n me if he is not one\r\nof the prettiest fellows in the whole world; but he went farther than\r\nI with the old cull, for Jimmey can neither write nor read.”\r\n\r\n“You give your friend a very good character,” said the lieutenant,\r\n“and a very deserved one, I dare say. But prithee, Northerton, leave\r\noff that foolish as well as wicked custom of swearing; for you are\r\ndeceived, I promise you, if you think there is wit or politeness in\r\nit. I wish, too, you would take my advice, and desist from abusing the\r\nclergy. Scandalous names, and reflections cast on any body of men,\r\nmust be always unjustifiable; but especially so, when thrown on so\r\nsacred a function; for to abuse the body is to abuse the function\r\nitself; and I leave to you to judge how inconsistent such behaviour is\r\nin men who are going to fight in defence of the Protestant religion.”\r\n\r\nMr Adderly, which was the name of the other ensign, had sat hitherto\r\nkicking his heels and humming a tune, without seeming to listen to the\r\ndiscourse; he now answered, “_O, Monsieur, on ne parle pas de la\r\nreligion dans la guerre_.”--“Well said, Jack,” cries Northerton: “if\r\n_la religion_ was the only matter, the parsons should fight their own\r\nbattles for me.”\r\n\r\n“I don't know, gentlemen,” said Jones, “what may be your opinion; but\r\nI think no man can engage in a nobler cause than that of his religion;\r\nand I have observed, in the little I have read of history, that no\r\nsoldiers have fought so bravely as those who have been inspired with a\r\nreligious zeal: for my own part, though I love my king and country, I\r\nhope, as well as any man in it, yet the Protestant interest is no\r\nsmall motive to my becoming a volunteer in the cause.”\r\n\r\nNortherton now winked on Adderly, and whispered to him slily, “Smoke\r\nthe prig, Adderly, smoke him.” Then turning to Jones, said to him, “I\r\nam very glad, sir, you have chosen our regiment to be a volunteer in;\r\nfor if our parson should at any time take a cup too much, I find you\r\ncan supply his place. I presume, sir, you have been at the university;\r\nmay I crave the favour to know what college?”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” answered Jones, “so far from having been at the university, I\r\nhave even had the advantage of yourself, for I was never at school.”\r\n\r\n“I presumed,” cries the ensign, “only upon the information of your\r\ngreat learning.”--“Oh! sir,” answered Jones, “it is as possible for a\r\nman to know something without having been at school, as it is to have\r\nbeen at school and to know nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Well said, young volunteer,” cries the lieutenant. “Upon my word,\r\nNortherton, you had better let him alone; for he will be too hard for\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nNortherton did not very well relish the sarcasm of Jones; but he\r\nthought the provocation was scarce sufficient to justify a blow, or a\r\nrascal, or scoundrel, which were the only repartees that suggested\r\nthemselves. He was, therefore, silent at present; but resolved to take\r\nthe first opportunity of returning the jest by abuse.\r\n\r\nIt now came to the turn of Mr Jones to give a toast, as it is called;\r\nwho could not refrain from mentioning his dear Sophia. This he did the\r\nmore readily, as he imagined it utterly impossible that any one\r\npresent should guess the person he meant.\r\n\r\nBut the lieutenant, who was the toast-master, was not contented with\r\nSophia only. He said, he must have her sir-name; upon which Jones\r\nhesitated a little, and presently after named Miss Sophia Western.\r\nEnsign Northerton declared he would not drink her health in the same\r\nround with his own toast, unless somebody would vouch for her. “I knew\r\none Sophy Western,” says he, “that was lain with by half the young\r\nfellows at Bath; and perhaps this is the same woman.” Jones very\r\nsolemnly assured him of the contrary; asserting that the young lady he\r\nnamed was one of great fashion and fortune. “Ay, ay,” says the ensign,\r\n“and so she is: d--n me, it is the same woman; and I'll hold half a\r\ndozen of Burgundy, Tom French of our regiment brings her into company\r\nwith us at any tavern in Bridges-street.” He then proceeded to\r\ndescribe her person exactly (for he had seen her with her aunt), and\r\nconcluded with saying, “that her father had a great estate in\r\nSomersetshire.”\r\n\r\nThe tenderness of lovers can ill brook the least jesting with the\r\nnames of their mistresses. However, Jones, though he had enough of the\r\nlover and of the heroe too in his disposition, did not resent these\r\nslanders as hastily as, perhaps, he ought to have done. To say the\r\ntruth, having seen but little of this kind of wit, he did not readily\r\nunderstand it, and for a long time imagined Mr Northerton had really\r\nmistaken his charmer for some other. But now, turning to the ensign\r\nwith a stern aspect, he said, “Pray, sir, chuse some other subject for\r\nyour wit; for I promise you I will bear no jesting with this lady's\r\ncharacter.” “Jesting!” cries the other, “d--n me if ever I was more in\r\nearnest in my life. Tom French of our regiment had both her and her\r\naunt at Bath.” “Then I must tell you in earnest,” cries Jones, “that\r\nyou are one of the most impudent rascals upon earth.”\r\n\r\nHe had no sooner spoken these words, than the ensign, together with a\r\nvolley of curses, discharged a bottle full at the head of Jones, which\r\nhitting him a little above the right temple, brought him instantly to\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nThe conqueror perceiving the enemy to lie motionless before him, and\r\nblood beginning to flow pretty plentifully from his wound, began now\r\nto think of quitting the field of battle, where no more honour was to\r\nbe gotten; but the lieutenant interposed, by stepping before the door,\r\nand thus cut off his retreat.\r\n\r\nNortherton was very importunate with the lieutenant for his liberty;\r\nurging the ill consequences of his stay, asking him, what he could\r\nhave done less? “Zounds!” says he, “I was but in jest with the fellow.\r\nI never heard any harm of Miss Western in my life.” “Have not you?”\r\n said the lieutenant; “then you richly deserve to be hanged, as well\r\nfor making such jests, as for using such a weapon: you are my\r\nprisoner, sir; nor shall you stir from hence till a proper guard comes\r\nto secure you.”\r\n\r\nSuch an ascendant had our lieutenant over this ensign, that all that\r\nfervency of courage which had levelled our poor heroe with the floor,\r\nwould scarce have animated the said ensign to have drawn his sword\r\nagainst the lieutenant, had he then had one dangling at his side: but\r\nall the swords being hung up in the room, were, at the very beginning\r\nof the fray, secured by the French officer. So that Mr Northerton was\r\nobliged to attend the final issue of this affair.\r\n\r\nThe French gentleman and Mr Adderly, at the desire of their commanding\r\nofficer, had raised up the body of Jones, but as they could perceive\r\nbut little (if any) sign of life in him, they again let him fall,\r\nAdderly damning him for having blooded his wastecoat; and the\r\nFrenchman declaring, “Begar, me no tush the Engliseman de mort: me\r\nhave heard de Englise ley, law, what you call, hang up de man dat tush\r\nhim last.”\r\n\r\nWhen the good lieutenant applied himself to the door, he applied\r\nhimself likewise to the bell; and the drawer immediately attending, he\r\ndispatched him for a file of musqueteers and a surgeon. These\r\ncommands, together with the drawer's report of what he had himself\r\nseen, not only produced the soldiers, but presently drew up the\r\nlandlord of the house, his wife, and servants, and, indeed, every one\r\nelse who happened at that time to be in the inn.\r\n\r\nTo describe every particular, and to relate the whole conversation of\r\nthe ensuing scene, is not within my power, unless I had forty pens,\r\nand could, at once, write with them all together, as the company now\r\nspoke. The reader must, therefore, content himself with the most\r\nremarkable incidents, and perhaps he may very well excuse the rest.\r\n\r\nThe first thing done was securing the body of Northerton, who being\r\ndelivered into the custody of six men with a corporal at their head,\r\nwas by them conducted from a place which he was very willing to leave,\r\nbut it was unluckily to a place whither he was very unwilling to go.\r\nTo say the truth, so whimsical are the desires of ambition, the very\r\nmoment this youth had attained the above-mentioned honour, he would\r\nhave been well contented to have retired to some corner of the world,\r\nwhere the fame of it should never have reached his ears.\r\n\r\nIt surprizes us, and so perhaps, it may the reader, that the\r\nlieutenant, a worthy and good man, should have applied his chief care,\r\nrather to secure the offender, than to preserve the life of the\r\nwounded person. We mention this observation, not with any view of\r\npretending to account for so odd a behaviour, but lest some critic\r\nshould hereafter plume himself on discovering it. We would have these\r\ngentlemen know we can see what is odd in characters as well as\r\nthemselves, but it is our business to relate facts as they are; which,\r\nwhen we have done, it is the part of the learned and sagacious reader\r\nto consult that original book of nature, whence every passage in our\r\nwork is transcribed, though we quote not always the particular page\r\nfor its authority.\r\n\r\nThe company which now arrived were of a different disposition. They\r\nsuspended their curiosity concerning the person of the ensign, till\r\nthey should see him hereafter in a more engaging attitude. At present,\r\ntheir whole concern and attention were employed about the bloody\r\nobject on the floor; which being placed upright in a chair, soon began\r\nto discover some symptoms of life and motion. These were no sooner\r\nperceived by the company (for Jones was at first generally concluded\r\nto be dead) than they all fell at once to prescribing for him (for as\r\nnone of the physical order was present, every one there took that\r\noffice upon him).\r\n\r\nBleeding was the unanimous voice of the whole room; but unluckily\r\nthere was no operator at hand; every one then cried, “Call the\r\nbarber;” but none stirred a step. Several cordials was likewise\r\nprescribed in the same ineffective manner; till the landlord ordered\r\nup a tankard of strong beer, with a toast, which he said was the best\r\ncordial in England.\r\n\r\nThe person principally assistant on this occasion, indeed the only one\r\nwho did any service, or seemed likely to do any, was the landlady: she\r\ncut off some of her hair, and applied it to the wound to stop the\r\nblood; she fell to chafing the youth's temples with her hand; and\r\nhaving exprest great contempt for her husband's prescription of beer,\r\nshe despatched one of her maids to her own closet for a bottle of\r\nbrandy, of which, as soon as it was brought, she prevailed on Jones,\r\nwho was just returned to his senses, to drink a very large and\r\nplentiful draught.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards arrived the surgeon, who having viewed the wound,\r\nhaving shaken his head, and blamed everything which was done, ordered\r\nhis patient instantly to bed; in which place we think proper to leave\r\nhim some time to his repose, and shall here, therefore, put an end to\r\nthis chapter."

      "content": "Containing the great address of the landlady, the great learning of a\r\nsurgeon, and the solid skill in casuistry of the worthy lieutenant.\r\n\nWhen the wounded man was carried to his bed, and the house began again\r\nto clear up from the hurry which this accident had occasioned, the\r\nlandlady thus addressed the commanding officer: “I am afraid, sir,”\r\n said she, “this young man did not behave himself as well as he should\r\ndo to your honours; and if he had been killed, I suppose he had but\r\nhis desarts: to be sure, when gentlemen admit inferior parsons into\r\ntheir company, they oft to keep their distance; but, as my first\r\nhusband used to say, few of 'em know how to do it. For my own part, I\r\nam sure I should not have suffered any fellows to _include_ themselves\r\ninto gentlemen's company; but I thoft he had been an officer himself,\r\ntill the serjeant told me he was but a recruit.”\r\n\r\n“Landlady,” answered the lieutenant, “you mistake the whole matter.\r\nThe young man behaved himself extremely well, and is, I believe, a\r\nmuch better gentleman than the ensign who abused him. If the young\r\nfellow dies, the man who struck him will have most reason to be sorry\r\nfor it: for the regiment will get rid of a very troublesome fellow,\r\nwho is a scandal to the army; and if he escapes from the hands of\r\njustice, blame me, madam, that's all.”\r\n\r\n“Ay! ay! good lack-a-day!” said the landlady; “who could have thoft\r\nit? Ay, ay, ay, I am satisfied your honour will see justice done; and\r\nto be sure it oft to be to every one. Gentlemen oft not to kill poor\r\nfolks without answering for it. A poor man hath a soul to be saved, as\r\nwell as his betters.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, madam,” said the lieutenant, “you do the volunteer wrong: I\r\ndare swear he is more of a gentleman than the officer.”\r\n\r\n“Ay!” cries the landlady; “why, look you there, now: well, my first\r\nhusband was a wise man; he used to say, you can't always know the\r\ninside by the outside. Nay, that might have been well enough too; for\r\nI never _saw'd_ him till he was all over blood. Who would have thoft\r\nit? mayhap, some young gentleman crossed in love. Good lack-a-day, if\r\nhe should die, what a concern it will be to his parents! why, sure the\r\ndevil must possess the wicked wretch to do such an act. To be sure, he\r\nis a scandal to the army, as your honour says; for most of the\r\ngentlemen of the army that ever I saw, are quite different sort of\r\npeople, and look as if they would scorn to spill any Christian blood\r\nas much as any men: I mean, that is, in a civil way, as my first\r\nhusband used to say. To be sure, when they come into the wars, there\r\nmust be bloodshed: but that they are not to be blamed for. The more of\r\nour enemies they kill there, the better: and I wish, with all my\r\nheart, they could kill every mother's son of them.”\r\n\r\n“O fie, madam!” said the lieutenant, smiling; “_all_ is rather too\r\nbloody-minded a wish.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all, sir,” answered she; “I am not at all bloody-minded, only\r\nto our enemies; and there is no harm in that. To be sure it is natural\r\nfor us to wish our enemies dead, that the wars may be at an end, and\r\nour taxes be lowered; for it is a dreadful thing to pay as we do. Why\r\nnow, there is above forty shillings for window-lights, and yet we have\r\nstopt up all we could; we have almost blinded the house, I am sure.\r\nSays I to the exciseman, says I, I think you oft to favour us; I am\r\nsure we are very good friends to the government: and so we are for\r\nsartain, for we pay a mint of money to 'um. And yet I often think to\r\nmyself the government doth not imagine itself more obliged to us, than\r\nto those that don't pay 'um a farthing. Ay, ay, it is the way of the\r\nworld.”\r\n\r\nShe was proceeding in this manner when the surgeon entered the room.\r\nThe lieutenant immediately asked how his patient did. But he resolved\r\nhim only by saying, “Better, I believe, than he would have been by\r\nthis time, if I had not been called; and even as it is, perhaps it\r\nwould have been lucky if I could have been called sooner.”--“I hope,\r\nsir,” said the lieutenant, “the skull is not fractured.”--“Hum,” cries\r\nthe surgeon: “fractures are not always the most dangerous symptoms.\r\nContusions and lacerations are often attended with worse phaenomena,\r\nand with more fatal consequences, than fractures. People who know\r\nnothing of the matter conclude, if the skull is not fractured, all is\r\nwell; whereas, I had rather see a man's skull broke all to pieces,\r\nthan some contusions I have met with.”--“I hope,” says the lieutenant,\r\n“there are no such symptoms here.”--“Symptoms,” answered the surgeon,\r\n“are not always regular nor constant. I have known very unfavourable\r\nsymptoms in the morning change to favourable ones at noon, and return\r\nto unfavourable again at night. Of wounds, indeed, it is rightly and\r\ntruly said, _Nemo repente fuit turpissimus_. I was once, I remember,\r\ncalled to a patient who had received a violent contusion in his tibia,\r\nby which the exterior cutis was lacerated, so that there was a profuse\r\nsanguinary discharge; and the interior membranes were so divellicated,\r\nthat the os or bone very plainly appeared through the aperture of the\r\nvulnus or wound. Some febrile symptoms intervening at the same time\r\n(for the pulse was exuberant and indicated much phlebotomy), I\r\napprehended an immediate mortification. To prevent which, I presently\r\nmade a large orifice in the vein of the left arm, whence I drew twenty\r\nounces of blood; which I expected to have found extremely sizy and\r\nglutinous, or indeed coagulated, as it is in pleuretic complaints;\r\nbut, to my surprize, it appeared rosy and florid, and its consistency\r\ndiffered little from the blood of those in perfect health. I then\r\napplied a fomentation to the part, which highly answered the\r\nintention; and after three or four times dressing, the wound began to\r\ndischarge a thick pus or matter, by which means the cohesion--But\r\nperhaps I do not make myself perfectly well understood?”--“No,\r\nreally,” answered the lieutenant, “I cannot say I understand a\r\nsyllable.”--“Well, sir,” said the surgeon, “then I shall not tire your\r\npatience; in short, within six weeks my patient was able to walk upon\r\nhis legs as perfectly as he could have done before he received the\r\ncontusion.”--“I wish, sir,” said the lieutenant, “you would be so kind\r\nonly to inform me, whether the wound this young gentleman hath had the\r\nmisfortune to receive, is likely to prove mortal.”--“Sir,” answered\r\nthe surgeon, “to say whether a wound will prove mortal or not at first\r\ndressing, would be very weak and foolish presumption: we are all\r\nmortal, and symptoms often occur in a cure which the greatest of our\r\nprofession could never foresee.”--“But do you think him in danger?”\r\n says the other.--“In danger! ay, surely,” cries the doctor: “who is\r\nthere among us, who, in the most perfect health, can be said not to be\r\nin danger? Can a man, therefore, with so bad a wound as this be said\r\nto be out of danger? All I can say at present is, that it is well I\r\nwas called as I was, and perhaps it would have been better if I had\r\nbeen called sooner. I will see him again early in the morning; and in\r\nthe meantime let him be kept extremely quiet, and drink liberally of\r\nwater-gruel.”--“Won't you allow him sack-whey?” said the\r\nlandlady.--“Ay, ay, sack-whey,” cries the doctor, “if you will,\r\nprovided it be very small.”--“And a little chicken broth too?” added\r\nshe.--“Yes, yes, chicken broth,” said the doctor, “is very\r\ngood.”--“Mayn't I make him some jellies too?” said the landlady.--“Ay,\r\nay,” answered the doctor, “jellies are very good for wounds, for they\r\npromote cohesion.” And indeed it was lucky she had not named soup or\r\nhigh sauces, for the doctor would have complied, rather than have lost\r\nthe custom of the house.\r\n\r\nThe doctor was no sooner gone, than the landlady began to trumpet\r\nforth his fame to the lieutenant, who had not, from their short\r\nacquaintance, conceived quite so favourable an opinion of his physical\r\nabilities as the good woman, and all the neighbourhood, entertained\r\n(and perhaps very rightly); for though I am afraid the doctor was a\r\nlittle of a coxcomb, he might be nevertheless very much of a surgeon.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant having collected from the learned discourse of the\r\nsurgeon that Mr Jones was in great danger, gave orders for keeping Mr\r\nNortherton under a very strict guard, designing in the morning to\r\nattend him to a justice of peace, and to commit the conducting the\r\ntroops to Gloucester to the French lieutenant, who, though he could\r\nneither read, write, nor speak any language, was, however, a good\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, our commander sent a message to Mr Jones, that if a\r\nvisit would not be troublesome, he would wait on him. This civility\r\nwas very kindly and thankfully received by Jones, and the lieutenant\r\naccordingly went up to his room, where he found the wounded man much\r\nbetter than he expected; nay, Jones assured his friend, that if he had\r\nnot received express orders to the contrary from the surgeon, he\r\nshould have got up long ago; for he appeared to himself to be as well\r\nas ever, and felt no other inconvenience from his wound but an extreme\r\nsoreness on that side of his head.\r\n\r\n“I should be very glad,” quoth the lieutenant, “if you was as well as\r\nyou fancy yourself, for then you could be able to do yourself justice\r\nimmediately; for when a matter can't be made up, as in case of a blow,\r\nthe sooner you take him out the better; but I am afraid you think\r\nyourself better than you are, and he would have too much advantage\r\nover you.”\r\n\r\n“I'll try, however,” answered Jones, “if you please, and will be so\r\nkind to lend me a sword, for I have none here of my own.”\r\n\r\n“My sword is heartily at your service, my dear boy,” cries the\r\nlieutenant, kissing him; “you are a brave lad, and I love your spirit;\r\nbut I fear your strength; for such a blow, and so much loss of blood,\r\nmust have very much weakened you; and though you feel no want of\r\nstrength in your bed, yet you most probably would after a thrust or\r\ntwo. I can't consent to your taking him out tonight; but I hope you\r\nwill be able to come up with us before we get many days' march\r\nadvance; and I give you my honour you shall have satisfaction, or the\r\nman who hath injured you shan't stay in our regiment.”\r\n\r\n“I wish,” said Jones, “it was possible to decide this matter to-night:\r\nnow you have mentioned it to me, I shall not be able to rest.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, never think of it,” returned the other: “a few days will make no\r\ndifference. The wounds of honour are not like those in your body: they\r\nsuffer nothing by the delay of cure. It will be altogether as well for\r\nyou to receive satisfaction a week hence as now.”\r\n\r\n“But suppose,” says Jones, “I should grow worse, and die of the\r\nconsequences of my present wound?”\r\n\r\n“Then your honour,” answered the lieutenant, “will require no\r\nreparation at all. I myself will do justice to your character, and\r\ntestify to the world your intention to have acted properly, if you had\r\nrecovered.”\r\n\r\n“Still,” replied Jones, “I am concerned at the delay. I am almost\r\nafraid to mention it to you who are a soldier; but though I have been\r\na very wild young fellow, still in my most serious moments, and at the\r\nbottom, I am really a Christian.”\r\n\r\n“So am I too, I assure you,” said the officer; “and so zealous a one,\r\nthat I was pleased with you at dinner for taking up the cause of your\r\nreligion; and I am a little offended with you now, young gentleman,\r\nthat you should express a fear of declaring your faith before any\r\none.”\r\n\r\n“But how terrible must it be,” cries Jones, “to any one who is really\r\na Christian, to cherish malice in his breast, in opposition to the\r\ncommand of Him who hath expressly forbid it? How can I bear to do this\r\non a sick-bed? Or how shall I make up my account, with such an article\r\nas this in my bosom against me?”\r\n\r\n“Why, I believe there is such a command,” cries the lieutenant; “but a\r\nman of honour can't keep it. And you must be a man of honour, if you\r\nwill be in the army. I remember I once put the case to our chaplain\r\nover a bowl of punch, and he confessed there was much difficulty in\r\nit; but he said, he hoped there might be a latitude granted to\r\nsoldiers in this one instance; and to be sure it is our duty to hope\r\nso; for who would bear to live without his honour? No, no, my dear\r\nboy, be a good Christian as long as you live; but be a man of honour\r\ntoo, and never put up an affront; not all the books, nor all the\r\nparsons in the world, shall ever persuade me to that. I love my\r\nreligion very well, but I love my honour more. There must be some\r\nmistake in the wording the text, or in the translation, or in the\r\nunderstanding it, or somewhere or other. But however that be, a man\r\nmust run the risque, for he must preserve his honour. So compose\r\nyourself to-night, and I promise you you shall have an opportunity of\r\ndoing yourself justice.” Here he gave Jones a hearty buss, shook him\r\nby the hand, and took his leave.\r\n\r\nBut though the lieutenant's reasoning was very satisfactory to\r\nhimself, it was not entirely so to his friend. Jones therefore, having\r\nrevolved this matter much in his thoughts, at last came to a\r\nresolution, which the reader will find in the next chapter."

      "title": "Chapter xiv.",
      "content": "A most dreadful chapter indeed; and which few readers ought to venture\r\nupon in an evening, especially when alone.\r\n\nJones swallowed a large mess of chicken, or rather cock, broth, with a\r\nvery good appetite, as indeed he would have done the cock it was made\r\nof, with a pound of bacon into the bargain; and now, finding in\r\nhimself no deficiency of either health or spirit, he resolved to get\r\nup and seek his enemy.\r\n\r\nBut first he sent for the serjeant, who was his first acquaintance\r\namong these military gentlemen. Unluckily that worthy officer having,\r\nin a literal sense, taken his fill of liquor, had been some time\r\nretired to his bolster, where he was snoring so loud that it was not\r\neasy to convey a noise in at his ears capable of drowning that which\r\nissued from his nostrils.\r\n\r\nHowever, as Jones persisted in his desire of seeing him, a vociferous\r\ndrawer at length found means to disturb his slumbers, and to acquaint\r\nhim with the message. Of which the serjeant was no sooner made\r\nsensible, than he arose from his bed, and having his clothes already\r\non, immediately attended. Jones did not think fit to acquaint the\r\nserjeant with his design; though he might have done it with great\r\nsafety, for the halberdier was himself a man of honour, and had killed\r\nhis man. He would therefore have faithfully kept this secret, or\r\nindeed any other which no reward was published for discovering. But as\r\nJones knew not those virtues in so short an acquaintance, his caution\r\nwas perhaps prudent and commendable enough.\r\n\r\nHe began therefore by acquainting the serjeant, that as he was now\r\nentered into the army, he was ashamed of being without what was\r\nperhaps the most necessary implement of a soldier; namely, a sword;\r\nadding, that he should be infinitely obliged to him, if he could\r\nprocure one. “For which,” says he, “I will give you any reasonable\r\nprice; nor do I insist upon its being silver-hilted; only a good\r\nblade, and such as may become a soldier's thigh.”\r\n\r\nThe serjeant, who well knew what had happened, and had heard that\r\nJones was in a very dangerous condition, immediately concluded, from\r\nsuch a message, at such a time of night, and from a man in such a\r\nsituation, that he was light-headed. Now as he had his wit (to use\r\nthat word in its common signification) always ready, he bethought\r\nhimself of making his advantage of this humour in the sick man. “Sir,”\r\n says he, “I believe I can fit you. I have a most excellent piece of\r\nstuff by me. It is not indeed silver-hilted, which, as you say, doth\r\nnot become a soldier; but the handle is decent enough, and the blade\r\none of the best in Europe. It is a blade that--a blade that--in short,\r\nI will fetch it you this instant, and you shall see it and handle it.\r\nI am glad to see your honour so well with all my heart.”\r\n\r\nBeing instantly returned with the sword, he delivered it to Jones, who\r\ntook it and drew it; and then told the serjeant it would do very well,\r\nand bid him name his price.\r\n\r\nThe serjeant now began to harangue in praise of his goods. He said\r\n(nay he swore very heartily), “that the blade was taken from a French\r\nofficer, of very high rank, at the battle of Dettingen. I took it\r\nmyself,” says he, “from his side, after I had knocked him o' the head.\r\nThe hilt was a golden one. That I sold to one of our fine gentlemen;\r\nfor there are some of them, an't please your honour, who value the\r\nhilt of a sword more than the blade.”\r\n\r\nHere the other stopped him, and begged him to name a price. The\r\nserjeant, who thought Jones absolutely out of his senses, and very\r\nnear his end, was afraid lest he should injure his family by asking\r\ntoo little. However, after a moment's hesitation, he contented himself\r\nwith naming twenty guineas, and swore he would not sell it for less to\r\nhis own brother.\r\n\r\n“Twenty guineas!” says Jones, in the utmost surprize: “sure you think\r\nI am mad, or that I never saw a sword in my life. Twenty guineas,\r\nindeed! I did not imagine you would endeavour to impose upon me. Here,\r\ntake the sword--No, now I think on't, I will keep it myself, and show\r\nit your officer in the morning, acquainting him, at the same time,\r\nwhat a price you asked me for it.”\r\n\r\nThe serjeant, as we have said, had always his wit (_in sensu\r\npraedicto_) about him, and now plainly saw that Jones was not in the\r\ncondition he had apprehended him to be; he now, therefore,\r\ncounterfeited as great surprize as the other had shown, and said, “I\r\nam certain, sir, I have not asked you so much out of the way. Besides,\r\nyou are to consider, it is the only sword I have, and I must run the\r\nrisque of my officer's displeasure, by going without one myself. And\r\ntruly, putting all this together, I don't think twenty shillings was\r\nso much out of the way.”\r\n\r\n“Twenty shillings!” cries Jones; “why, you just now asked me twenty\r\nguineas.”--“How!” cries the serjeant, “sure your honour must have\r\nmistaken me: or else I mistook myself--and indeed I am but half awake.\r\nTwenty guineas, indeed! no wonder your honour flew into such a\r\npassion. I say twenty guineas too. No, no, I mean twenty shillings, I\r\nassure you. And when your honour comes to consider everything, I hope\r\nyou will not think that so extravagant a price. It is indeed true, you\r\nmay buy a weapon which looks as well for less money. But----”\r\n\r\nHere Jones interrupted him, saying, “I will be so far from making any\r\nwords with you, that I will give you a shilling more than your\r\ndemand.” He then gave him a guinea, bid him return to his bed, and\r\nwished him a good march; adding, he hoped to overtake them before the\r\ndivision reached Worcester.\r\n\r\nThe serjeant very civilly took his leave, fully satisfied with his\r\nmerchandize, and not a little pleased with his dexterous recovery from\r\nthat false step into which his opinion of the sick man's\r\nlight-headedness had betrayed him.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the serjeant was departed, Jones rose from his bed, and\r\ndressed himself entirely, putting on even his coat, which, as its\r\ncolour was white, showed very visibly the streams of blood which had\r\nflowed down it; and now, having grasped his new-purchased sword in his\r\nhand, he was going to issue forth, when the thought of what he was\r\nabout to undertake laid suddenly hold of him, and he began to reflect\r\nthat in a few minutes he might possibly deprive a human being of life,\r\nor might lose his own. “Very well,” said he, “and in what cause do I\r\nventure my life? Why, in that of my honour. And who is this human\r\nbeing? A rascal who hath injured and insulted me without provocation.\r\nBut is not revenge forbidden by Heaven? Yes, but it is enjoined by the\r\nworld. Well, but shall I obey the world in opposition to the express\r\ncommands of Heaven? Shall I incur the Divine displeasure rather than\r\nbe called--ha--coward--scoundrel?--I'll think no more; I am resolved,\r\nand must fight him.”\r\n\r\nThe clock had now struck twelve, and every one in the house were in\r\ntheir beds, except the centinel who stood to guard Northerton, when\r\nJones softly opening his door, issued forth in pursuit of his enemy,\r\nof whose place of confinement he had received a perfect description\r\nfrom the drawer. It is not easy to conceive a much more tremendous\r\nfigure than he now exhibited. He had on, as we have said, a\r\nlight-coloured coat, covered with streams of blood. His face, which\r\nmissed that very blood, as well as twenty ounces more drawn from him\r\nby the surgeon, was pallid. Round his head was a quantity of bandage,\r\nnot unlike a turban. In the right hand he carried a sword, and in the\r\nleft a candle. So that the bloody Banquo was not worthy to be compared\r\nto him. In fact, I believe a more dreadful apparition was never raised\r\nin a church-yard, nor in the imagination of any good people met in a\r\nwinter evening over a Christmas fire in Somersetshire.\r\n\r\nWhen the centinel first saw our heroe approach, his hair began gently\r\nto lift up his grenadier cap; and in the same instant his knees fell\r\nto blows with each other. Presently his whole body was seized with\r\nworse than an ague fit. He then fired his piece, and fell flat on his\r\nface.\r\n\r\nWhether fear or courage was the occasion of his firing, or whether he\r\ntook aim at the object of his terror, I cannot say. If he did,\r\nhowever, he had the good fortune to miss his man.\r\n\r\nJones seeing the fellow fall, guessed the cause of his fright, at\r\nwhich he could not forbear smiling, not in the least reflecting on the\r\ndanger from which he had just escaped. He then passed by the fellow,\r\nwho still continued in the posture in which he fell, and entered the\r\nroom where Northerton, as he had heard, was confined. Here, in a\r\nsolitary situation, he found--an empty quart pot standing on the\r\ntable, on which some beer being spilt, it looked as if the room had\r\nlately been inhabited; but at present it was entirely vacant.\r\n\r\nJones then apprehended it might lead to some other apartment; but upon\r\nsearching all round it, he could perceive no other door than that at\r\nwhich he entered, and where the centinel had been posted. He then\r\nproceeded to call Northerton several times by his name; but no one\r\nanswered; nor did this serve to any other purpose than to confirm the\r\ncentinel in his terrors, who was now convinced that the volunteer was\r\ndead of his wounds, and that his ghost was come in search of the\r\nmurderer: he now lay in all the agonies of horror; and I wish, with\r\nall my heart, some of those actors who are hereafter to represent a\r\nman frighted out of his wits had seen him, that they might be taught\r\nto copy nature, instead of performing several antic tricks and\r\ngestures, for the entertainment and applause of the galleries.\r\n\r\nPerceiving the bird was flown, at least despairing to find him, and\r\nrightly apprehending that the report of the firelock would alarm the\r\nwhole house, our heroe now blew out his candle, and gently stole back\r\nagain to his chamber, and to his bed; whither he would not have been\r\nable to have gotten undiscovered, had any other person been on the\r\nsame staircase, save only one gentleman who was confined to his bed by\r\nthe gout; for before he could reach the door to his chamber, the hall\r\nwhere the centinel had been posted was half full of people, some in\r\ntheir shirts, and others not half drest, all very earnestly enquiring\r\nof each other what was the matter.\r\n\r\nThe soldier was now found lying in the same place and posture in which\r\nwe just now left him. Several immediately applied themselves to raise\r\nhim, and some concluded him dead; but they presently saw their\r\nmistake, for he not only struggled with those who laid their hands on\r\nhim, but fell a roaring like a bull. In reality, he imagined so many\r\nspirits or devils were handling him; for his imagination being\r\npossessed with the horror of an apparition, converted every object he\r\nsaw or felt into nothing but ghosts and spectres.\r\n\r\nAt length he was overpowered by numbers, and got upon his legs; when\r\ncandles being brought, and seeing two or three of his comrades\r\npresent, he came a little to himself; but when they asked him what was\r\nthe matter? he answered, “I am a dead man, that's all, I am a dead\r\nman, I can't recover it, I have seen him.” “What hast thou seen,\r\nJack?” says one of the soldiers. “Why, I have seen the young volunteer\r\nthat was killed yesterday.” He then imprecated the most heavy curses\r\non himself, if he had not seen the volunteer, all over blood, vomiting\r\nfire out of his mouth and nostrils, pass by him into the chamber where\r\nEnsign Northerton was, and then seizing the ensign by the throat, fly\r\naway with him in a clap of thunder.\r\n\r\nThis relation met with a gracious reception from the audience. All the\r\nwomen present believed it firmly, and prayed Heaven to defend them\r\nfrom murder. Amongst the men too, many had faith in the story; but\r\nothers turned it into derision and ridicule; and a serjeant who was\r\npresent answered very coolly, “Young man, you will hear more of this,\r\nfor going to sleep and dreaming on your post.”\r\n\r\nThe soldier replied, “You may punish me if you please; but I was as\r\nbroad awake as I am now; and the devil carry me away, as he hath the\r\nensign, if I did not see the dead man, as I tell you, with eyes as big\r\nand as fiery as two large flambeaux.”\r\n\r\nThe commander of the forces, and the commander of the house, were now\r\nboth arrived; for the former being awake at the time, and hearing the\r\ncentinel fire his piece, thought it his duty to rise immediately,\r\nthough he had no great apprehensions of any mischief; whereas the\r\napprehensions of the latter were much greater, lest her spoons and\r\ntankards should be upon the march, without having received any such\r\norders from her.\r\n\r\nOur poor centinel, to whom the sight of this officer was not much more\r\nwelcome than the apparition, as he thought it, which he had seen\r\nbefore, again related the dreadful story, and with many additions of\r\nblood and fire; but he had the misfortune to gain no credit with\r\neither of the last-mentioned persons: for the officer, though a very\r\nreligious man, was free from all terrors of this kind; besides, having\r\nso lately left Jones in the condition we have seen, he had no\r\nsuspicion of his being dead. As for the landlady, though not over\r\nreligious, she had no kind of aversion to the doctrine of spirits; but\r\nthere was a circumstance in the tale which she well knew to be false,\r\nas we shall inform the reader presently.\r\n\r\nBut whether Northerton was carried away in thunder or fire, or in\r\nwhatever other manner he was gone, it was now certain that his body\r\nwas no longer in custody. Upon this occasion the lieutenant formed a\r\nconclusion not very different from what the serjeant is just mentioned\r\nto have made before, and immediately ordered the centinel to be taken\r\nprisoner. So that, by a strange reverse of fortune (though not very\r\nuncommon in a military life), the guard became the guarded."

      "content": "The conclusion of the foregoing adventure.\r\n\nBesides the suspicion of sleep, the lieutenant harboured another and\r\nworse doubt against the poor centinel, and this was, that of\r\ntreachery; for as he believed not one syllable of the apparition, so\r\nhe imagined the whole to be an invention formed only to impose upon\r\nhim, and that the fellow had in reality been bribed by Northerton to\r\nlet him escape. And this he imagined the rather, as the fright\r\nappeared to him the more unnatural in one who had the character of as\r\nbrave and bold a man as any in the regiment, having been in several\r\nactions, having received several wounds, and, in a word, having\r\nbehaved himself always like a good and valiant soldier.\r\n\r\nThat the reader, therefore, may not conceive the least ill opinion of\r\nsuch a person, we shall not delay a moment in rescuing his character\r\nfrom the imputation of this guilt.\r\n\r\nMr Northerton then, as we have before observed, was fully satisfied\r\nwith the glory which he had obtained from this action. He had perhaps\r\nseen, or heard, or guessed, that envy is apt to attend fame. Not that\r\nI would here insinuate that he was heathenishly inclined to believe in\r\nor to worship the goddess Nemesis; for, in fact, I am convinced he\r\nnever heard of her name. He was, besides, of an active disposition,\r\nand had a great antipathy to those close quarters in the castle of\r\nGloucester, for which a justice of peace might possibly give him a\r\nbillet. Nor was he moreover free from some uneasy meditations on a\r\ncertain wooden edifice, which I forbear to name, in conformity to the\r\nopinion of mankind, who, I think, rather ought to honour than to be\r\nashamed of this building, as it is, or at least might be made, of more\r\nbenefit to society than almost any other public erection. In a word,\r\nto hint at no more reasons for his conduct, Mr Northerton was desirous\r\nof departing that evening, and nothing remained for him but to\r\ncontrive the quomodo, which appeared to be a matter of some\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nNow this young gentleman, though somewhat crooked in his morals, was\r\nperfectly straight in his person, which was extremely strong and well\r\nmade. His face too was accounted handsome by the generality of women,\r\nfor it was broad and ruddy, with tolerably good teeth. Such charms did\r\nnot fail making an impression on my landlady, who had no little relish\r\nfor this kind of beauty. She had, indeed, a real compassion for the\r\nyoung man; and hearing from the surgeon that affairs were like to go\r\nill with the volunteer, she suspected they might hereafter wear no\r\nbenign aspect with the ensign. Having obtained, therefore, leave to\r\nmake him a visit, and finding him in a very melancholy mood, which she\r\nconsiderably heightened by telling him there were scarce any hopes of\r\nthe volunteer's life, she proceeded to throw forth some hints, which\r\nthe other readily and eagerly taking up, they soon came to a right\r\nunderstanding; and it was at length agreed that the ensign should, at\r\na certain signal, ascend the chimney, which communicating very soon\r\nwith that of the kitchen, he might there again let himself down; for\r\nwhich she would give him an opportunity by keeping the coast clear.\r\n\r\nBut lest our readers, of a different complexion, should take this\r\noccasion of too hastily condemning all compassion as a folly, and\r\npernicious to society, we think proper to mention another particular\r\nwhich might possibly have some little share in this action. The ensign\r\nhappened to be at this time possessed of the sum of fifty pounds,\r\nwhich did indeed belong to the whole company; for the captain having\r\nquarrelled with his lieutenant, had entrusted the payment of his\r\ncompany to the ensign. This money, however, he thought proper to\r\ndeposit in my landlady's hand, possibly by way of bail or security\r\nthat he would hereafter appear and answer to the charge against him;\r\nbut whatever were the conditions, certain it is, that she had the\r\nmoney and the ensign his liberty.\r\n\r\nThe reader may perhaps expect, from the compassionate temper of this\r\ngood woman, that when she saw the poor centinel taken prisoner for a\r\nfact of which she knew him innocent, she should immediately have\r\ninterposed in his behalf; but whether it was that she had already\r\nexhausted all her compassion in the above-mentioned instance, or that\r\nthe features of this fellow, though not very different from those of\r\nthe ensign, could not raise it, I will not determine; but, far from\r\nbeing an advocate for the present prisoner, she urged his guilt to his\r\nofficer, declaring, with uplifted eyes and hands, that she would not\r\nhave had any concern in the escape of a murderer for all the world.\r\n\r\nEverything was now once more quiet, and most of the company returned\r\nagain to their beds; but the landlady, either from the natural\r\nactivity of her disposition, or from her fear for her plate, having no\r\npropensity to sleep, prevailed with the officers, as they were to\r\nmarch within little more than an hour, to spend that time with her\r\nover a bowl of punch.\r\n\r\nJones had lain awake all this while, and had heard great part of the\r\nhurry and bustle that had passed, of which he had now some curiosity\r\nto know the particulars. He therefore applied to his bell, which he\r\nrung at least twenty times without any effect: for my landlady was in\r\nsuch high mirth with her company, that no clapper could be heard there\r\nbut her own; and the drawer and chambermaid, who were sitting together\r\nin the kitchen (for neither durst he sit up nor she lie in bed alone),\r\nthe more they heard the bell ring the more they were frightened, and\r\nas it were nailed down in their places.\r\n\r\nAt last, at a lucky interval of chat, the sound reached the ears of\r\nour good landlady, who presently sent forth her summons, which both\r\nher servants instantly obeyed. “Joe,” says the mistress, “don't you\r\nhear the gentleman's bell ring? Why don't you go up?”--“It is not my\r\nbusiness,” answered the drawer, “to wait upon the chambers--it is\r\nBetty Chambermaid's.”--“If you come to that,” answered the maid, “it\r\nis not my business to wait upon gentlemen. I have done it indeed\r\nsometimes; but the devil fetch me if ever I do again, since you make\r\nyour preambles about it.” The bell still ringing violently, their\r\nmistress fell into a passion, and swore, if the drawer did not go up\r\nimmediately, she would turn him away that very morning. “If you do,\r\nmadam,” says he, “I can't help it. I won't do another servant's\r\nbusiness.” She then applied herself to the maid, and endeavoured to\r\nprevail by gentle means; but all in vain: Betty was as inflexible as\r\nJoe. Both insisted it was not their business, and they would not do\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant then fell a laughing, and said, “Come, I will put an\r\nend to this contention;” and then turning to the servants, commended\r\nthem for their resolution in not giving up the point; but added, he\r\nwas sure, if one would consent to go the other would. To which\r\nproposal they both agreed in an instant, and accordingly went up very\r\nlovingly and close together. When they were gone, the lieutenant\r\nappeased the wrath of the landlady, by satisfying her why they were\r\nboth so unwilling to go alone.\r\n\r\nThey returned soon after, and acquainted their mistress, that the sick\r\ngentleman was so far from being dead, that he spoke as heartily as if\r\nhe was well; and that he gave his service to the captain, and should\r\nbe very glad of the favour of seeing him before he marched.\r\n\r\nThe good lieutenant immediately complied with his desires, and sitting\r\ndown by his bed-side, acquainted him with the scene which had happened\r\nbelow, concluding with his intentions to make an example of the\r\ncentinel.\r\n\r\nUpon this Jones related to him the whole truth, and earnestly begged\r\nhim not to punish the poor soldier, “who, I am confident,” says he,\r\n“is as innocent of the ensign's escape, as he is of forging any lie,\r\nor of endeavouring to impose on you.”\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant hesitated a few moments, and then answered: “Why, as\r\nyou have cleared the fellow of one part of the charge, so it will be\r\nimpossible to prove the other, because he was not the only centinel.\r\nBut I have a good mind to punish the rascal for being a coward. Yet\r\nwho knows what effect the terror of such an apprehension may have?\r\nand, to say the truth, he hath always behaved well against an enemy.\r\nCome, it is a good thing to see any sign of religion in these fellows;\r\nso I promise you he shall be set at liberty when we march. But hark,\r\nthe general beats. My dear boy, give me another buss. Don't discompose\r\nnor hurry yourself; but remember the Christian doctrine of patience,\r\nand I warrant you will soon be able to do yourself justice, and to\r\ntake an honourable revenge on the fellow who hath injured you.” The\r\nlieutenant then departed, and Jones endeavoured to compose himself to\r\nrest.\r\n\nBOOK VIII.\r\n\r\nCONTAINING ABOUT TWO DAYS."

    {
      "title": "Chapter i.",
      "content": "A wonderful long chapter concerning the marvellous; being much the\r\nlongest of all our introductory chapters.\r\n\nAs we are now entering upon a book in which the course of our history\r\nwill oblige us to relate some matters of a more strange and surprizing\r\nkind than any which have hitherto occurred, it may not be amiss, in\r\nthe prolegomenous or introductory chapter, to say something of that\r\nspecies of writing which is called the marvellous. To this we shall,\r\nas well for the sake of ourselves as of others, endeavour to set some\r\ncertain bounds, and indeed nothing can be more necessary, as\r\ncritics[*] of different complexions are here apt to run into very\r\ndifferent extremes; for while some are, with M. Dacier, ready to\r\nallow, that the same thing which is impossible may be yet\r\nprobable,[**] others have so little historic or poetic faith, that they\r\nbelieve nothing to be either possible or probable, the like to which\r\nhath not occurred to their own observation.\r\n\r\n [*] By this word here, and in most other parts of our work, we mean\r\n every reader in the world.\r\n [**] It is happy for M. Dacier that he was not an Irishman.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, I think it may very reasonably be required of every\r\nwriter, that he keeps within the bounds of possibility; and still\r\nremembers that what it is not possible for man to perform, it is\r\nscarce possible for man to believe he did perform. This conviction\r\nperhaps gave birth to many stories of the antient heathen deities (for\r\nmost of them are of poetical original). The poet, being desirous to\r\nindulge a wanton and extravagant imagination, took refuge in that\r\npower, of the extent of which his readers were no judges, or rather\r\nwhich they imagined to be infinite, and consequently they could not be\r\nshocked at any prodigies related of it. This hath been strongly urged\r\nin defence of Homer's miracles; and it is perhaps a defence; not, as\r\nMr Pope would have it, because Ulysses told a set of foolish lies to\r\nthe Phaeacians, who were a very dull nation; but because the poet\r\nhimself wrote to heathens, to whom poetical fables were articles of\r\nfaith. For my own part, I must confess, so compassionate is my temper,\r\nI wish Polypheme had confined himself to his milk diet, and preserved\r\nhis eye; nor could Ulysses be much more concerned than myself, when\r\nhis companions were turned into swine by Circe, who showed, I think,\r\nafterwards, too much regard for man's flesh to be supposed capable of\r\nconverting it into bacon. I wish, likewise, with all my heart, that\r\nHomer could have known the rule prescribed by Horace, to introduce\r\nsupernatural agents as seldom as possible. We should not then have\r\nseen his gods coming on trivial errands, and often behaving themselves\r\nso as not only to forfeit all title to respect, but to become the\r\nobjects of scorn and derision. A conduct which must have shocked the\r\ncredulity of a pious and sagacious heathen; and which could never have\r\nbeen defended, unless by agreeing with a supposition to which I have\r\nbeen sometimes almost inclined, that this most glorious poet, as he\r\ncertainly was, had an intent to burlesque the superstitious faith of\r\nhis own age and country.\r\n\r\nBut I have rested too long on a doctrine which can be of no use to a\r\nChristian writer; for as he cannot introduce into his works any of\r\nthat heavenly host which make a part of his creed, so it is horrid\r\npuerility to search the heathen theology for any of those deities who\r\nhave been long since dethroned from their immortality. Lord\r\nShaftesbury observes, that nothing is more cold than the invocation of\r\na muse by a modern; he might have added, that nothing can be more\r\nabsurd. A modern may with much more elegance invoke a ballad, as some\r\nhave thought Homer did, or a mug of ale, with the author of Hudibras;\r\nwhich latter may perhaps have inspired much more poetry, as well as\r\nprose, than all the liquors of Hippocrene or Helicon.\r\n\r\nThe only supernatural agents which can in any manner be allowed to us\r\nmoderns, are ghosts; but of these I would advise an author to be\r\nextremely sparing. These are indeed, like arsenic, and other dangerous\r\ndrugs in physic, to be used with the utmost caution; nor would I\r\nadvise the introduction of them at all in those works, or by those\r\nauthors, to which, or to whom, a horse-laugh in the reader would be\r\nany great prejudice or mortification.\r\n\r\nAs for elves and fairies, and other such mummery, I purposely omit the\r\nmention of them, as I should be very unwilling to confine within any\r\nbounds those surprizing imaginations, for whose vast capacity the\r\nlimits of human nature are too narrow; whose works are to be\r\nconsidered as a new creation; and who have consequently just right to\r\ndo what they will with their own.\r\n\r\nMan therefore is the highest subject (unless on very extraordinary\r\noccasions indeed) which presents itself to the pen of our historian,\r\nor of our poet; and, in relating his actions, great care is to be\r\ntaken that we do not exceed the capacity of the agent we describe.\r\n\r\nNor is possibility alone sufficient to justify us; we must keep\r\nlikewise within the rules of probability. It is, I think, the opinion\r\nof Aristotle; or if not, it is the opinion of some wise man, whose\r\nauthority will be as weighty when it is as old, “That it is no excuse\r\nfor a poet who relates what is incredible, that the thing related is\r\nreally matter of fact.” This may perhaps be allowed true with regard\r\nto poetry, but it may be thought impracticable to extend it to the\r\nhistorian; for he is obliged to record matters as he finds them,\r\nthough they may be of so extraordinary a nature as will require no\r\nsmall degree of historical faith to swallow them. Such was the\r\nsuccessless armament of Xerxes described by Herodotus, or the\r\nsuccessful expedition of Alexander related by Arrian. Such of later\r\nyears was the victory of Agincourt obtained by Harry the Fifth, or\r\nthat of Narva won by Charles the Twelfth of Sweden. All which\r\ninstances, the more we reflect on them, appear still the more\r\nastonishing.\r\n\r\nSuch facts, however, as they occur in the thread of the story, nay,\r\nindeed, as they constitute the essential parts of it, the historian is\r\nnot only justifiable in recording as they really happened, but indeed\r\nwould be unpardonable should he omit or alter them. But there are\r\nother facts not of such consequence nor so necessary, which, though\r\never so well attested, may nevertheless be sacrificed to oblivion in\r\ncomplacence to the scepticism of a reader. Such is that memorable\r\nstory of the ghost of George Villiers, which might with more propriety\r\nhave been made a present of to Dr Drelincourt, to have kept the ghost\r\nof Mrs Veale company, at the head of his Discourse upon Death, than\r\nhave been introduced into so solemn a work as the History of the\r\nRebellion.\r\n\r\nTo say the truth, if the historian will confine himself to what really\r\nhappened, and utterly reject any circumstance, which, though never so\r\nwell attested, he must be well assured is false, he will sometimes\r\nfall into the marvellous, but never into the incredible. He will often\r\nraise the wonder and surprize of his reader, but never that\r\nincredulous hatred mentioned by Horace. It is by falling into fiction,\r\ntherefore, that we generally offend against this rule, of deserting\r\nprobability, which the historian seldom, if ever, quits, till he\r\nforsakes his character and commences a writer of romance. In this,\r\nhowever, those historians who relate public transactions, have the\r\nadvantage of us who confine ourselves to scenes of private life. The\r\ncredit of the former is by common notoriety supported for a long time;\r\nand public records, with the concurrent testimony of many authors,\r\nbear evidence to their truth in future ages. Thus a Trajan and an\r\nAntoninus, a Nero and a Caligula, have all met with the belief of\r\nposterity; and no one doubts but that men so very good, and so very\r\nbad, were once the masters of mankind.\r\n\r\nBut we who deal in private character, who search into the most retired\r\nrecesses, and draw forth examples of virtue and vice from holes and\r\ncorners of the world, are in a more dangerous situation. As we have no\r\npublic notoriety, no concurrent testimony, no records to support and\r\ncorroborate what we deliver, it becomes us to keep within the limits\r\nnot only of possibility, but of probability too; and this more\r\nespecially in painting what is greatly good and amiable. Knavery and\r\nfolly, though never so exorbitant, will more easily meet with assent;\r\nfor ill-nature adds great support and strength to faith.\r\n\r\nThus we may, perhaps, with little danger, relate the history of\r\nFisher; who having long owed his bread to the generosity of Mr Derby,\r\nand having one morning received a considerable bounty from his hands,\r\nyet, in order to possess himself of what remained in his friend's\r\nscrutore, concealed himself in a public office of the Temple, through\r\nwhich there was a passage into Mr Derby's chambers. Here he overheard\r\nMr Derby for many hours solacing himself at an entertainment which he\r\nthat evening gave his friends, and to which Fisher had been invited.\r\nDuring all this time, no tender, no grateful reflections arose to\r\nrestrain his purpose; but when the poor gentleman had let his company\r\nout through the office, Fisher came suddenly from his lurking-place,\r\nand walking softly behind his friend into his chamber, discharged a\r\npistol-ball into his head. This may be believed when the bones of\r\nFisher are as rotten as his heart. Nay, perhaps, it will be credited,\r\nthat the villain went two days afterwards with some young ladies to\r\nthe play of Hamlet; and with an unaltered countenance heard one of the\r\nladies, who little suspected how near she was to the person, cry out,\r\n“Good God! if the man that murdered Mr Derby was now present!”\r\n manifesting in this a more seared and callous conscience than even\r\nNero himself; of whom we are told by Suetonius, “that the\r\nconsciousness of his guilt, after the death of his mother, became\r\nimmediately intolerable, and so continued; nor could all the\r\ncongratulations of the soldiers, of the senate, and the people, allay\r\nthe horrors of his conscience.”\r\n\r\nBut now, on the other hand, should I tell my reader, that I had known\r\na man whose penetrating genius had enabled him to raise a large\r\nfortune in a way where no beginning was chaulked out to him; that he\r\nhad done this with the most perfect preservation of his integrity, and\r\nnot only without the least injustice or injury to any one individual\r\nperson, but with the highest advantage to trade, and a vast increase\r\nof the public revenue; that he had expended one part of the income of\r\nthis fortune in discovering a taste superior to most, by works where\r\nthe highest dignity was united with the purest simplicity, and another\r\npart in displaying a degree of goodness superior to all men, by acts\r\nof charity to objects whose only recommendations were their merits, or\r\ntheir wants; that he was most industrious in searching after merit in\r\ndistress, most eager to relieve it, and then as careful (perhaps too\r\ncareful) to conceal what he had done; that his house, his furniture,\r\nhis gardens, his table, his private hospitality, and his public\r\nbeneficence, all denoted the mind from which they flowed, and were all\r\nintrinsically rich and noble, without tinsel, or external ostentation;\r\nthat he filled every relation in life with the most adequate virtue;\r\nthat he was most piously religious to his Creator, most zealously\r\nloyal to his sovereign; a most tender husband to his wife, a kind\r\nrelation, a munificent patron, a warm and firm friend, a knowing and a\r\nchearful companion, indulgent to his servants, hospitable to his\r\nneighbours, charitable to the poor, and benevolent to all mankind.\r\nShould I add to these the epithets of wise, brave, elegant, and indeed\r\nevery other amiable epithet in our language, I might surely say,\r\n\r\n _--Quis credet? nemo Hercule! nemo;\r\n Vel duo, vel nemo;_\r\n\r\nand yet I know a man who is all I have here described. But a single\r\ninstance (and I really know not such another) is not sufficient to\r\njustify us, while we are writing to thousands who never heard of the\r\nperson, nor of anything like him. Such _rarae aves_ should be remitted\r\nto the epitaph writer, or to some poet who may condescend to hitch him\r\nin a distich, or to slide him into a rhime with an air of carelessness\r\nand neglect, without giving any offence to the reader.\r\n\r\nIn the last place, the actions should be such as may not only be\r\nwithin the compass of human agency, and which human agents may\r\nprobably be supposed to do; but they should be likely for the very\r\nactors and characters themselves to have performed; for what may be\r\nonly wonderful and surprizing in one man, may become improbable, or\r\nindeed impossible, when related of another.\r\n\r\nThis last requisite is what the dramatic critics call conversation of\r\ncharacter; and it requires a very extraordinary degree of judgment,\r\nand a most exact knowledge of human nature.\r\n\r\nIt is admirably remarked by a most excellent writer, that zeal can no\r\nmore hurry a man to act in direct opposition to itself, than a rapid\r\nstream can carry a boat against its own current. I will venture to\r\nsay, that for a man to act in direct contradiction to the dictates of\r\nhis nature, is, if not impossible, as improbable and as miraculous as\r\nanything which can well be conceived. Should the best parts of the\r\nstory of M. Antoninus be ascribed to Nero, or should the worst\r\nincidents of Nero's life be imputed to Antoninus, what would be more\r\nshocking to belief than either instance? whereas both these being\r\nrelated of their proper agent, constitute the truly marvellous.\r\n\r\nOur modern authors of comedy have fallen almost universally into the\r\nerror here hinted at; their heroes generally are notorious rogues, and\r\ntheir heroines abandoned jades, during the first four acts; but in the\r\nfifth, the former become very worthy gentlemen, and the latter women\r\nof virtue and discretion: nor is the writer often so kind as to give\r\nhimself the least trouble to reconcile or account for this monstrous\r\nchange and incongruity. There is, indeed, no other reason to be\r\nassigned for it, than because the play is drawing to a conclusion; as\r\nif it was no less natural in a rogue to repent in the last act of a\r\nplay, than in the last of his life; which we perceive to be generally\r\nthe case at Tyburn, a place which might indeed close the scene of some\r\ncomedies with much propriety, as the heroes in these are most commonly\r\neminent for those very talents which not only bring men to the\r\ngallows, but enable them to make an heroic figure when they are there.\r\n\r\nWithin these few restrictions, I think, every writer may be permitted\r\nto deal as much in the wonderful as he pleases; nay, if he thus keeps\r\nwithin the rules of credibility, the more he can surprize the reader\r\nthe more he will engage his attention, and the more he will charm him.\r\nAs a genius of the highest rank observes in his fifth chapter of the\r\nBathos, “The great art of all poetry is to mix truth with fiction, in\r\norder to join the credible with the surprizing.”\r\n\r\nFor though every good author will confine himself within the bounds of\r\nprobability, it is by no means necessary that his characters, or his\r\nincidents, should be trite, common, or vulgar; such as happen in every\r\nstreet, or in every house, or which may be met with in the home\r\narticles of a newspaper. Nor must he be inhibited from showing many\r\npersons and things, which may possibly have never fallen within the\r\nknowledge of great part of his readers. If the writer strictly\r\nobserves the rules above-mentioned, he hath discharged his part; and\r\nis then intitled to some faith from his reader, who is indeed guilty\r\nof critical infidelity if he disbelieves him.\r\n\r\nFor want of a portion of such faith, I remember the character of a\r\nyoung lady of quality, which was condemned on the stage for being\r\nunnatural, by the unanimous voice of a very large assembly of clerks\r\nand apprentices; though it had the previous suffrages of many ladies\r\nof the first rank; one of whom, very eminent for her understanding,\r\ndeclared it was the picture of half the young people of her\r\nacquaintance."

      "content": "In which the landlady pays a visit to Mr Jones.\r\n\nWhen Jones had taken leave of his friend the lieutenant, he\r\nendeavoured to close his eyes, but all in vain; his spirits were too\r\nlively and wakeful to be lulled to sleep. So having amused, or rather\r\ntormented, himself with the thoughts of his Sophia till it was open\r\ndaylight, he called for some tea; upon which occasion my landlady\r\nherself vouchsafed to pay him a visit.\r\n\r\nThis was indeed the first time she had seen him, or at least had taken\r\nany notice of him; but as the lieutenant had assured her that he was\r\ncertainly some young gentleman of fashion, she now determined to show\r\nhim all the respect in her power; for, to speak truly, this was one of\r\nthose houses where gentlemen, to use the language of advertisements,\r\nmeet with civil treatment for their money.\r\n\r\nShe had no sooner begun to make his tea, than she likewise began to\r\ndiscourse:--“La! sir,” said she, “I think it is great pity that such a\r\npretty young gentleman should under-value himself so, as to go about\r\nwith these soldier fellows. They call themselves gentlemen, I warrant\r\nyou; but, as my first husband used to say, they should remember it is\r\nwe that pay them. And to be sure it is very hard upon us to be obliged\r\nto pay them, and to keep 'um too, as we publicans are. I had twenty of\r\n'um last night, besides officers: nay, for matter o' that, I had\r\nrather have the soldiers than officers: for nothing is ever good\r\nenough for those sparks; and I am sure, if you was to see the bills;\r\nla! sir, it is nothing. I have had less trouble, I warrant you, with a\r\ngood squire's family, where we take forty or fifty shillings of a\r\nnight, besides horses. And yet I warrants me, there is narrow a one of\r\nthose officer fellows but looks upon himself to be as good as arrow a\r\nsquire of £500 a year. To be sure it doth me good to hear their men\r\nrun about after 'um, crying your honour, and your honour. Marry come\r\nup with such honour, and an ordinary at a shilling a head. Then\r\nthere's such swearing among 'um, to be sure it frightens me out o' my\r\nwits: I thinks nothing can ever prosper with such wicked people. And\r\nhere one of 'um has used you in so barbarous a manner. I thought\r\nindeed how well the rest would secure him; they all hang together; for\r\nif you had been in danger of death, which I am glad to see you are\r\nnot, it would have been all as one to such wicked people. They would\r\nhave let the murderer go. Laud have mercy upon 'um; I would not have\r\nsuch a sin to answer for, for the whole world. But though you are\r\nlikely, with the blessing, to recover, there is laa for him yet; and\r\nif you will employ lawyer Small, I darest be sworn he'll make the\r\nfellow fly the country for him; though perhaps he'll have fled the\r\ncountry before; for it is here to-day and gone to-morrow with such\r\nchaps. I hope, however, you will learn more wit for the future, and\r\nreturn back to your friends; I warrant they are all miserable for your\r\nloss; and if they was but to know what had happened--La, my seeming! I\r\nwould not for the world they should. Come, come, we know very well\r\nwhat all the matter is; but if one won't, another will; so pretty a\r\ngentleman need never want a lady. I am sure, if I was you, I would see\r\nthe finest she that ever wore a head hanged, before I would go for a\r\nsoldier for her.--Nay, don't blush so” (for indeed he did to a violent\r\ndegree). “Why, you thought, sir, I knew nothing of the matter, I\r\nwarrant you, about Madam Sophia.”--“How,” says Jones, starting up, “do\r\nyou know my Sophia?”--“Do I! ay marry,” cries the landlady; “many's\r\nthe time hath she lain in this house.”--“With her aunt, I suppose,”\r\n says Jones. “Why, there it is now,” cries the landlady. “Ay, ay, ay, I\r\nknow the old lady very well. And a sweet young creature is Madam\r\nSophia, that's the truth on't.”--“A sweet creature,” cries Jones; “O\r\nheavens!”\r\n\r\n Angels are painted fair to look like her.\r\n There's in her all that we believe of heav'n,\r\n Amazing brightness, purity, and truth,\r\n Eternal joy and everlasting love.\r\n\r\n“And could I ever have imagined that you had known my Sophia!”--“I\r\nwish,” says the landlady, “you knew half so much of her. What would\r\nyou have given to have sat by her bed-side? What a delicious neck she\r\nhath! Her lovely limbs have stretched themselves in that very bed you\r\nnow lie in.”--“Here!” cries Jones: “hath Sophia ever laid here?”--“Ay,\r\nay, here; there, in that very bed,” says the landlady; “where I wish\r\nyou had her this moment; and she may wish so too for anything I know\r\nto the contrary, for she hath mentioned your name to me.”--“Ha!” cries\r\nhe; “did she ever mention her poor Jones? You flatter me now: I can\r\nnever believe so much.”--“Why, then,” answered she, “as I hope to be\r\nsaved, and may the devil fetch me if I speak a syllable more than the\r\ntruth, I have heard her mention Mr Jones; but in a civil and modest\r\nway, I confess; yet I could perceive she thought a great deal more\r\nthan she said.”--“O my dear woman!” cries Jones, “her thoughts of me I\r\nshall never be worthy of. Oh, she is all gentleness, kindness,\r\ngoodness! Why was such a rascal as I born, ever to give her soft bosom\r\na moment's uneasiness? Why am I cursed? I, who would undergo all the\r\nplagues and miseries which any daemon ever invented for mankind, to\r\nprocure her any good; nay, torture itself could not be misery to me,\r\ndid I but know that she was happy.”--“Why, look you there now,” says\r\nthe landlady; “I told her you was a constant lovier.”--“But pray,\r\nmadam, tell me when or where you knew anything of me; for I never was\r\nhere before, nor do I remember ever to have seen you.”--“Nor is it\r\npossible you should,” answered she; “for you was a little thing when I\r\nhad you in my lap at the squire's.”--“How, the squire's?” says Jones:\r\n“what, do you know that great and good Mr Allworthy then?”--“Yes,\r\nmarry, do I,” says she: “who in the country doth not?”--“The fame of\r\nhis goodness indeed,” answered Jones, “must have extended farther than\r\nthis; but heaven only can know him--can know that benevolence which it\r\ncopied from itself, and sent upon earth as its own pattern. Mankind\r\nare as ignorant of such divine goodness, as they are unworthy of it;\r\nbut none so unworthy of it as myself. I, who was raised by him to such\r\na height; taken in, as you must well know, a poor base-born child,\r\nadopted by him, and treated as his own son, to dare by my follies to\r\ndisoblige him, to draw his vengeance upon me. Yes, I deserve it all;\r\nfor I will never be so ungrateful as ever to think he hath done an act\r\nof injustice by me. No, I deserve to be turned out of doors, as I am.\r\nAnd now, madam,” says he, “I believe you will not blame me for turning\r\nsoldier, especially with such a fortune as this in my pocket.” At\r\nwhich words he shook a purse, which had but very little in it, and\r\nwhich still appeared to the landlady to have less.\r\n\r\nMy good landlady was (according to vulgar phrase) struck all of a heap\r\nby this relation. She answered coldly, “That to be sure people were\r\nthe best judges what was most proper for their circumstances. But\r\nhark,” says she, “I think I hear somebody call. Coming! coming! the\r\ndevil's in all our volk; nobody hath any ears. I must go down-stairs;\r\nif you want any more breakfast the maid will come up. Coming!” At\r\nwhich words, without taking any leave, she flung out of the room; for\r\nthe lower sort of people are very tenacious of respect; and though\r\nthey are contented to give this gratis to persons of quality, yet they\r\nnever confer it on those of their own order without taking care to be\r\nwell paid for their pains."

      "content": "In which the surgeon makes his second appearance.\r\n\nBefore we proceed any farther, that the reader may not be mistaken in\r\nimagining the landlady knew more than she did, nor surprized that she\r\nknew so much, it may be necessary to inform him that the lieutenant\r\nhad acquainted her that the name of Sophia had been the occasion of\r\nthe quarrel; and as for the rest of her knowledge, the sagacious\r\nreader will observe how she came by it in the preceding scene. Great\r\ncuriosity was indeed mixed with her virtues; and she never willingly\r\nsuffered any one to depart from her house, without enquiring as much\r\nas possible into their names, families, and fortunes.\r\n\r\nShe was no sooner gone than Jones, instead of animadverting on her\r\nbehaviour, reflected that he was in the same bed which he was informed\r\nhad held his dear Sophia. This occasioned a thousand fond and tender\r\nthoughts, which we would dwell longer upon, did we not consider that\r\nsuch kind of lovers will make a very inconsiderable part of our\r\nreaders. In this situation the surgeon found him, when he came to\r\ndress his wound. The doctor perceiving, upon examination, that his\r\npulse was disordered, and hearing that he had not slept, declared that\r\nhe was in great danger; for he apprehended a fever was coming on,\r\nwhich he would have prevented by bleeding, but Jones would not submit,\r\ndeclaring he would lose no more blood; “and, doctor,” says he, “if you\r\nwill be so kind only to dress my head, I have no doubt of being well\r\nin a day or two.”\r\n\r\n“I wish,” answered the surgeon, “I could assure your being well in a\r\nmonth or two. Well, indeed! No, no, people are not so soon well of\r\nsuch contusions; but, sir, I am not at this time of day to be\r\ninstructed in my operations by a patient, and I insist on making a\r\nrevulsion before I dress you.”\r\n\r\nJones persisted obstinately in his refusal, and the doctor at last\r\nyielded; telling him at the same time that he would not be answerable\r\nfor the ill consequence, and hoped he would do him the justice to\r\nacknowledge that he had given him a contrary advice; which the patient\r\npromised he would.\r\n\r\nThe doctor retired into the kitchen, where, addressing himself to the\r\nlandlady, he complained bitterly of the undutiful behaviour of his\r\npatient, who would not be blooded, though he was in a fever.\r\n\r\n“It is an eating fever then,” says the landlady; “for he hath devoured\r\ntwo swinging buttered toasts this morning for breakfast.”\r\n\r\n“Very likely,” says the doctor: “I have known people eat in a fever;\r\nand it is very easily accounted for; because the acidity occasioned by\r\nthe febrile matter may stimulate the nerves of the diaphragm, and\r\nthereby occasion a craving which will not be easily distinguishable\r\nfrom a natural appetite; but the aliment will not be concreted, nor\r\nassimilated into chyle, and so will corrode the vascular orifices, and\r\nthus will aggravate the febrific symptoms. Indeed, I think the\r\ngentleman in a very dangerous way, and, if he is not blooded, I am\r\nafraid will die.”\r\n\r\n“Every man must die some time or other,” answered the good woman; “it\r\nis no business of mine. I hope, doctor, you would not have me hold him\r\nwhile you bleed him. But, hark'ee, a word in your ear; I would advise\r\nyou, before you proceed too far, to take care who is to be your\r\npaymaster.”\r\n\r\n“Paymaster!” said the doctor, staring; “why, I've a gentleman under my\r\nhands, have I not?”\r\n\r\n“I imagined so as well as you,” said the landlady; “but, as my first\r\nhusband used to say, everything is not what it looks to be. He is an\r\narrant scrub, I assure you. However, take no notice that I mentioned\r\nanything to you of the matter; but I think people in business oft\r\nalways to let one another know such things.”\r\n\r\n“And have I suffered such a fellow as this,” cries the doctor, in a\r\npassion, “to instruct me? Shall I hear my practice insulted by one who\r\nwill not pay me? I am glad I have made this discovery in time. I will\r\nsee now whether he will be blooded or no.” He then immediately went\r\nupstairs, and flinging open the door of the chamber with much\r\nviolence, awaked poor Jones from a very sound nap, into which he was\r\nfallen, and, what was still worse, from a delicious dream concerning\r\nSophia.\r\n\r\n“Will you be blooded or no?” cries the doctor, in a rage. “I have told\r\nyou my resolution already,” answered Jones, “and I wish with all my\r\nheart you had taken my answer; for you have awaked me out of the\r\nsweetest sleep which I ever had in my life.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, ay,” cries the doctor; “many a man hath dozed away his life.\r\nSleep is not always good, no more than food; but remember, I demand of\r\nyou for the last time, will you be blooded?”--“I answer you for the\r\nlast time,” said Jones, “I will not.”--“Then I wash my hands of you,”\r\n cries the doctor; “and I desire you to pay me for the trouble I have\r\nhad already. Two journeys at 5s. each, two dressings at 5s. more, and\r\nhalf a crown for phlebotomy.”--“I hope,” said Jones, “you don't intend\r\nto leave me in this condition.”--“Indeed but I shall,” said the other.\r\n“Then,” said Jones, “you have used me rascally, and I will not pay you\r\na farthing.”--“Very well,” cries the doctor; “the first loss is the\r\nbest. What a pox did my landlady mean by sending for me to such\r\nvagabonds!” At which words he flung out of the room, and his patient\r\nturning himself about soon recovered his sleep; but his dream was\r\nunfortunately gone."

      "content": "In which is introduced one of the pleasantest barbers that was ever\r\nrecorded in history, the barber of Bagdad, or he in Don Quixote, not\r\nexcepted.\r\n\nThe clock had now struck five when Jones awaked from a nap of seven\r\nhours, so much refreshed, and in such perfect health and spirits, that\r\nhe resolved to get up and dress himself; for which purpose he unlocked\r\nhis portmanteau, and took out clean linen, and a suit of cloaths; but\r\nfirst he slipt on a frock, and went down into the kitchen to bespeak\r\nsomething that might pacify certain tumults he found rising within his\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\nMeeting the landlady, he accosted her with great civility, and asked,\r\n“What he could have for dinner?”--“For dinner!” says she; “it is an\r\nodd time a day to think about dinner. There is nothing drest in the\r\nhouse, and the fire is almost out.”--“Well, but,” says he, “I must\r\nhave something to eat, and it is almost indifferent to me what; for,\r\nto tell you the truth, I was never more hungry in my life.”--“Then,”\r\n says she, “I believe there is a piece of cold buttock and carrot,\r\nwhich will fit you.”--“Nothing better,” answered Jones; “but I should\r\nbe obliged to you, if you would let it be fried.” To which the\r\nlandlady consented, and said, smiling, “she was glad to see him so\r\nwell recovered;” for the sweetness of our heroe's temper was almost\r\nirresistible; besides, she was really no ill-humoured woman at the\r\nbottom; but she loved money so much, that she hated everything which\r\nhad the semblance of poverty.\r\n\r\nJones now returned in order to dress himself, while his dinner was\r\npreparing, and was, according to his orders, attended by the barber.\r\n\r\nThis barber, who went by the name of Little Benjamin, was a fellow of\r\ngreat oddity and humour, which had frequently let him into small\r\ninconveniencies, such as slaps in the face, kicks in the breech,\r\nbroken bones, &c. For every one doth not understand a jest; and those\r\nwho do are often displeased with being themselves the subjects of it.\r\nThis vice was, however, incurable in him; and though he had often\r\nsmarted for it, yet if ever he conceived a joke, he was certain to be\r\ndelivered of it, without the least respect of persons, time, or place.\r\n\r\nHe had a great many other particularities in his character, which I\r\nshall not mention, as the reader will himself very easily perceive\r\nthem, on his farther acquaintance with this extraordinary person.\r\n\r\nJones being impatient to be drest, for a reason which may be easily\r\nimagined, thought the shaver was very tedious in preparing his suds,\r\nand begged him to make haste; to which the other answered with much\r\ngravity, for he never discomposed his muscles on any account,\r\n“_Festina lente_, is a proverb which I learned long before I ever\r\ntouched a razor.”--“I find, friend, you are a scholar,” replied Jones.\r\n“A poor one,” said the barber, “_non omnia possumus omnes._”--“Again!”\r\n said Jones; “I fancy you are good at capping verses.”--“Excuse me,\r\nsir,” said the barber, “_non tanto me dignor honore_.” And then\r\nproceeding to his operation, “Sir,” said he, “since I have dealt in\r\nsuds, I could never discover more than two reasons for shaving; the\r\none is to get a beard, and the other to get rid of one. I conjecture,\r\nsir, it may not be long since you shaved from the former of these\r\nmotives. Upon my word, you have had good success; for one may say of\r\nyour beard, that it is _tondenti gravior_.”--“I conjecture,” says\r\nJones, “that thou art a very comical fellow.”--“You mistake me widely,\r\nsir,” said the barber: “I am too much addicted to the study of\r\nphilosophy; _hinc illae lacrymae_, sir; that's my misfortune. Too much\r\nlearning hath been my ruin.”--“Indeed,” says Jones, “I confess,\r\nfriend, you have more learning than generally belongs to your trade;\r\nbut I can't see how it can have injured you.”--“Alas! sir,” answered\r\nthe shaver, “my father disinherited me for it. He was a\r\ndancing-master; and because I could read before I could dance, he took\r\nan aversion to me, and left every farthing among his other\r\nchildren.--Will you please to have your temples--O la! I ask your\r\npardon, I fancy there is _hiatus in manuscriptis_. I heard you was\r\ngoing to the wars; but I find it was a mistake.”--“Why do you conclude\r\nso?” says Jones. “Sure, sir,” answered the barber, “you are too wise a\r\nman to carry a broken head thither; for that would be carrying coals\r\nto Newcastle.”\r\n\r\n“Upon my word,” cries Jones, “thou art a very odd fellow, and I like\r\nthy humour extremely; I shall be very glad if thou wilt come to me\r\nafter dinner, and drink a glass with me; I long to be better\r\nacquainted with thee.”\r\n\r\n“O dear sir!” said the barber, “I can do you twenty times as great a\r\nfavour, if you will accept of it.”--“What is that, my friend?” cries\r\nJones. “Why, I will drink a bottle with you if you please; for I\r\ndearly love good-nature; and as you have found me out to be a comical\r\nfellow, so I have no skill in physiognomy, if you are not one of the\r\nbest-natured gentlemen in the universe.” Jones now walked downstairs\r\nneatly drest, and perhaps the fair Adonis was not a lovelier figure;\r\nand yet he had no charms for my landlady; for as that good woman did\r\nnot resemble Venus at all in her person, so neither did she in her\r\ntaste. Happy had it been for Nanny the chambermaid, if she had seen\r\nwith the eyes of her mistress, for that poor girl fell so violently in\r\nlove with Jones in five minutes, that her passion afterwards cost her\r\nmany a sigh. This Nanny was extremely pretty, and altogether as coy;\r\nfor she had refused a drawer, and one or two young farmers in the\r\nneighbourhood, but the bright eyes of our heroe thawed all her ice in\r\na moment.\r\n\r\nWhen Jones returned to the kitchen, his cloth was not yet laid; nor\r\nindeed was there any occasion it should, his dinner remaining _in\r\nstatu quo_, as did the fire which was to dress it. This disappointment\r\nmight have put many a philosophical temper into a passion; but it had\r\nno such effect on Jones. He only gave the landlady a gentle rebuke,\r\nsaying, “Since it was so difficult to get it heated he would eat the\r\nbeef cold.” But now the good woman, whether moved by compassion, or by\r\nshame, or by whatever other motive, I cannot tell, first gave her\r\nservants a round scold for disobeying the orders which she had never\r\ngiven, and then bidding the drawer lay a napkin in the Sun, she set\r\nabout the matter in good earnest, and soon accomplished it.\r\n\r\nThis Sun, into which Jones was now conducted, was truly named, as\r\n_lucus a non lucendo_; for it was an apartment into which the sun had\r\nscarce ever looked. It was indeed the worst room in the house; and\r\nhappy was it for Jones that it was so. However, he was now too hungry\r\nto find any fault; but having once satisfied his appetite, he ordered\r\nthe drawer to carry a bottle of wine into a better room, and expressed\r\nsome resentment at having been shown into a dungeon.\r\n\r\nThe drawer having obeyed his commands, he was, after some time,\r\nattended by the barber, who would not indeed have suffered him to wait\r\nso long for his company had he not been listening in the kitchen to\r\nthe landlady, who was entertaining a circle that she had gathered\r\nround her with the history of poor Jones, part of which she had\r\nextracted from his own lips, and the other part was her own ingenious\r\ncomposition; for she said “he was a poor parish boy, taken into the\r\nhouse of Squire Allworthy, where he was bred up as an apprentice, and\r\nnow turned out of doors for his misdeeds, particularly for making love\r\nto his young mistress, and probably for robbing the house; for how\r\nelse should he come by the little money he hath; and this,” says she,\r\n“is your gentleman, forsooth!”--“A servant of Squire Allworthy!” says\r\nthe barber; “what's his name?”--“Why he told me his name was Jones,”\r\n says she: “perhaps he goes by a wrong name. Nay, and he told me, too,\r\nthat the squire had maintained him as his own son, thof he had\r\nquarrelled with him now.”--“And if his name be Jones, he told you the\r\ntruth,” said the barber; “for I have relations who live in that\r\ncountry; nay, and some people say he is his son.”--“Why doth he not go\r\nby the name of his father?”--“I can't tell that,” said the barber;\r\n“many people's sons don't go by the name of their father.”--“Nay,”\r\n said the landlady, “if I thought he was a gentleman's son, thof he was\r\na bye-blow, I should behave to him in another guess manner; for many\r\nof these bye-blows come to be great men, and, as my poor first husband\r\nused to say, never affront any customer that's a gentleman.”"

      "content": "A dialogue between Mr Jones and the barber.\r\n\nThis conversation passed partly while Jones was at dinner in his\r\ndungeon, and partly while he was expecting the barber in the parlour.\r\nAnd, as soon as it was ended, Mr Benjamin, as we have said, attended\r\nhim, and was very kindly desired to sit down. Jones then filling out a\r\nglass of wine, drank his health by the appellation of _doctissime\r\ntonsorum_. “_Ago tibi gratias, domine_” said the barber; and then\r\nlooking very steadfastly at Jones, he said, with great gravity, and\r\nwith a seeming surprize, as if he had recollected a face he had seen\r\nbefore, “Sir, may I crave the favour to know if your name is not\r\nJones?” To which the other answered, “That it was.”--“_Proh deum atque\r\nhominum fidem_!” says the barber; “how strangely things come to pass!\r\nMr Jones, I am your most obedient servant. I find you do not know me,\r\nwhich indeed is no wonder, since you never saw me but once, and then\r\nyou was very young. Pray, sir, how doth the good Squire Allworthy? how\r\ndoth _ille optimus omnium patronus_?”--“I find,” said Jones, “you do\r\nindeed know me; but I have not the like happiness of recollecting\r\nyou.”--“I do not wonder at that,” cries Benjamin; “but I am surprized\r\nI did not know you sooner, for you are not in the least altered. And\r\npray, sir, may I, without offence, enquire whither you are travelling\r\nthis way?”--“Fill the glass, Mr Barber,” said Jones, “and ask no more\r\nquestions.”--“Nay, sir,” answered Benjamin, “I would not be\r\ntroublesome; and I hope you don't think me a man of an impertinent\r\ncuriosity, for that is a vice which nobody can lay to my charge; but I\r\nask pardon; for when a gentleman of your figure travels without his\r\nservants, we may suppose him to be, as we say, _in casu incognito_,\r\nand perhaps I ought not to have mentioned your name.”--“I own,” says\r\nJones, “I did not expect to have been so well known in this country as\r\nI find I am; yet, for particular reasons, I shall be obliged to you if\r\nyou will not mention my name to any other person till I am gone from\r\nhence.”--“_Pauca verba_,” answered the barber;” and I wish no other\r\nhere knew you but myself; for some people have tongues; but I promise\r\nyou I can keep a secret. My enemies will allow me that virtue.”--“And\r\nyet that is not the characteristic of your profession, Mr Barber,”\r\n answered Jones. “Alas! sir,” replied Benjamin, “_Non si male nunc et\r\nolim sic erit_. I was not born nor bred a barber, I assure you. I have\r\nspent most of my time among gentlemen, and though I say it, I\r\nunderstand something of gentility. And if you had thought me as worthy\r\nof your confidence as you have some other people, I should have shown\r\nyou I could have kept a secret better. I should not have degraded your\r\nname in a public kitchen; for indeed, sir, some people have not used\r\nyou well; for besides making a public proclamation of what you told\r\nthem of a quarrel between yourself and Squire Allworthy, they added\r\nlies of their own, things which I knew to be lies.”--“You surprize me\r\ngreatly,” cries Jones. “Upon my word, sir,” answered Benjamin, “I tell\r\nthe truth, and I need not tell you my landlady was the person. I am\r\nsure it moved me to hear the story, and I hope it is all false; for I\r\nhave a great respect for you, I do assure you I have, and have had\r\never since the good-nature you showed to Black George, which was\r\ntalked of all over the country, and I received more than one letter\r\nabout it. Indeed, it made you beloved by everybody. You will pardon\r\nme, therefore; for it was real concern at what I heard made me ask\r\nmany questions; for I have no impertinent curiosity about me: but I\r\nlove good-nature and thence became _amoris abundantia erga te_.”\r\n\r\nEvery profession of friendship easily gains credit with the miserable;\r\nit is no wonder therefore, if Jones, who, besides his being miserable,\r\nwas extremely open-hearted, very readily believed all the professions\r\nof Benjamin, and received him into his bosom. The scraps of Latin,\r\nsome of which Benjamin applied properly enough, though it did not\r\nsavour of profound literature, seemed yet to indicate something\r\nsuperior to a common barber; and so indeed did his whole behaviour.\r\nJones therefore believed the truth of what he had said, as to his\r\noriginal and education; and at length, after much entreaty, he said,\r\n“Since you have heard, my friend, so much of my affairs, and seem so\r\ndesirous to know the truth, if you will have patience to hear it, I\r\nwill inform you of the whole.”--“Patience!” cries Benjamin, “that I\r\nwill, if the chapter was never so long; and I am very much obliged to\r\nyou for the honour you do me.”\r\n\r\nJones now began, and related the whole history, forgetting only a\r\ncircumstance or two, namely, everything which passed on that day in\r\nwhich he had fought with Thwackum; and ended with his resolution to go\r\nto sea, till the rebellion in the North had made him change his\r\npurpose, and had brought him to the place where he then was.\r\n\r\nLittle Benjamin, who had been all attention, never once interrupted\r\nthe narrative; but when it was ended he could not help observing, that\r\nthere must be surely something more invented by his enemies, and told\r\nMr Allworthy against him, or so good a man would never have dismissed\r\none he had loved so tenderly, in such a manner. To which Jones\r\nanswered, “He doubted not but such villanous arts had been made use of\r\nto destroy him.”\r\n\r\nAnd surely it was scarce possible for any one to have avoided making\r\nthe same remark with the barber, who had not indeed heard from Jones\r\none single circumstance upon which he was condemned; for his actions\r\nwere not now placed in those injurious lights in which they had been\r\nmisrepresented to Allworthy; nor could he mention those many false\r\naccusations which had been from time to time preferred against him to\r\nAllworthy: for with none of these he was himself acquainted. He had\r\nlikewise, as we have observed, omitted many material facts in his\r\npresent relation. Upon the whole, indeed, everything now appeared in\r\nsuch favourable colours to Jones, that malice itself would have found\r\nit no easy matter to fix any blame upon him.\r\n\r\nNot that Jones desired to conceal or to disguise the truth; nay, he\r\nwould have been more unwilling to have suffered any censure to fall on\r\nMr Allworthy for punishing him, than on his own actions for deserving\r\nit; but, in reality, so it happened, and so it always will happen; for\r\nlet a man be never so honest, the account of his own conduct will, in\r\nspite of himself, be so very favourable, that his vices will come\r\npurified through his lips, and, like foul liquors well strained, will\r\nleave all their foulness behind. For though the facts themselves may\r\nappear, yet so different will be the motives, circumstances, and\r\nconsequences, when a man tells his own story, and when his enemy tells\r\nit, that we scarce can recognise the facts to be one and the same.\r\n\r\nThough the barber had drank down this story with greedy ears, he was\r\nnot yet satisfied. There was a circumstance behind which his\r\ncuriosity, cold as it was, most eagerly longed for. Jones had\r\nmentioned the fact of his amour, and of his being the rival of Blifil,\r\nbut had cautiously concealed the name of the young lady. The barber,\r\ntherefore, after some hesitation, and many hums and hahs, at last\r\nbegged leave to crave the name of the lady, who appeared to be the\r\nprincipal cause of all this mischief. Jones paused a moment, and then\r\nsaid, “Since I have trusted you with so much, and since, I am afraid,\r\nher name is become too publick already on this occasion, I will not\r\nconceal it from you. Her name is Sophia Western.”\r\n\r\n“_Proh deum atque hominum fidem_! Squire Western hath a daughter grown\r\na woman!”--“Ay, and such a woman,” cries Jones, “that the world cannot\r\nmatch. No eye ever saw anything so beautiful; but that is her least\r\nexcellence. Such sense! such goodness! Oh, I could praise her for\r\never, and yet should omit half her virtues!”--“Mr Western a daughter\r\ngrown up!” cries the barber: “I remember the father a boy; well,\r\n_Tempus edax rerum_.”\r\n\r\nThe wine being now at an end, the barber pressed very eagerly to be\r\nhis bottle; but Jones absolutely refused, saying, “He had already\r\ndrank more than he ought: and that he now chose to retire to his room,\r\nwhere he wished he could procure himself a book.”--“A book!” cries\r\nBenjamin; “what book would you have? Latin or English? I have some\r\ncurious books in both languages; such as _Erasmi Colloquia, Ovid de\r\nTristibus, Gradus ad Parnassum;_ and in English I have several of the\r\nbest books, though some of them are a little torn; but I have a great\r\npart of Stowe's Chronicle; the sixth volume of Pope's Homer; the third\r\nvolume of the Spectator; the second volume of Echard's Roman History;\r\nthe Craftsman; Robinson Crusoe; Thomas a Kempis; and two volumes of\r\nTom Brown's Works.”\r\n\r\n“Those last,” cries Jones, “are books I never saw, so if you please\r\nlend me one of those volumes.” The barber assured him he would be\r\nhighly entertained, for he looked upon the author to have been one of\r\nthe greatest wits that ever the nation produced. He then stepped to\r\nhis house, which was hard by, and immediately returned; after which,\r\nthe barber having received very strict injunctions of secrecy from\r\nJones, and having sworn inviolably to maintain it, they separated; the\r\nbarber went home, and Jones retired to his chamber."

      "content": "In which more of the talents of Mr Benjamin will appear, as well as\r\nwho this extraordinary person was.\r\n\nIn the morning Jones grew a little uneasy at the desertion of his\r\nsurgeon, as he apprehended some inconvenience, or even danger, might\r\nattend the not dressing his wound; he enquired of the drawer, what\r\nother surgeons were to be met with in that neighbourhood. The drawer\r\ntold him, there was one not far off; but he had known him often refuse\r\nto be concerned after another had been sent before him; “but, sir,”\r\n says he, “if you will take my advice, there is not a man in the\r\nkingdom can do your business better than the barber who was with you\r\nlast night. We look upon him to be one of the ablest men at a cut in\r\nall this neighbourhood. For though he hath not been her above three\r\nmonths, he hath done several great cures.”\r\n\r\nThe drawer was presently dispatched for Little Benjamin, who being\r\nacquainted in what capacity he was wanted, prepared himself\r\naccordingly, and attended; but with so different an air and aspect\r\nfrom that which he wore when his basin was under his arm, that he\r\ncould scarce be known to be the same person.\r\n\r\n“So, tonsor,” says Jones, “I find you have more trades than one; how\r\ncame you not to inform me of this last night?”--“A surgeon,” answered\r\nBenjamin, with great gravity, “is a profession, not a trade. The\r\nreason why I did not acquaint you last night that I professed this\r\nart, was, that I then concluded you was under the hands of another\r\ngentleman, and I never love to interfere with my brethren in their\r\nbusiness. _Ars omnibus communis_. But now, sir, if you please, I will\r\ninspect your head, and when I see into your skull, I will give my\r\nopinion of your case.”\r\n\r\nJones had no great faith in this new professor; however, he suffered\r\nhim to open the bandage and to look at his wound; which as soon as he\r\nhad done, Benjamin began to groan and shake his head violently. Upon\r\nwhich Jones, in a peevish manner, bid him not play the fool, but tell\r\nhim in what condition he found him. “Shall I answer you as a surgeon,\r\nor a friend?” said Benjamin. “As a friend, and seriously,” said Jones.\r\n“Why then, upon my soul,” cries Benjamin, “it would require a great\r\ndeal of art to keep you from being well after a very few dressings;\r\nand if you will suffer me to apply some salve of mine, I will answer\r\nfor the success.” Jones gave his consent, and the plaister was applied\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n“There, sir,” cries Benjamin: “now I will, if you please, resume my\r\nformer self; but a man is obliged to keep up some dignity in his\r\ncountenance whilst he is performing these operations, or the world\r\nwill not submit to be handled by him. You can't imagine, sir, of how\r\nmuch consequence a grave aspect is to a grave character. A barber may\r\nmake you laugh, but a surgeon ought rather to make you cry.”\r\n\r\n“Mr Barber, or Mr Surgeon, or Mr Barber-surgeon,” said Jones. “O dear\r\nsir!” answered Benjamin, interrupting him, “_Infandum, regina, jubes\r\nrenovare dolorem_. You recall to my mind that cruel separation of the\r\nunited fraternities, so much to the prejudice of both bodies, as all\r\nseparations must be, according to the old adage, _Vis unita fortior_;\r\nwhich to be sure there are not wanting some of one or of the other\r\nfraternity who are able to construe. What a blow was this to me, who\r\nunite both in my own person!” “Well, by whatever name you please to be\r\ncalled,” continued Jones, “you certainly are one of the oddest, most\r\ncomical fellows I ever met with, and must have something very\r\nsurprizing in your story, which you must confess I have a right to\r\nhear.”--“I do confess it,” answered Benjamin, “and will very readily\r\nacquaint you with it, when you have sufficient leisure, for I promise\r\nyou it will require a good deal of time.” Jones told him, he could\r\nnever be more at leisure than at present. “Well, then,” said Benjamin,\r\n“I will obey you; but first I will fasten the door, that none may\r\ninterrupt us.” He did so, and then advancing with a solemn air to\r\nJones, said: “I must begin by telling you, sir, that you yourself have\r\nbeen the greatest enemy I ever had.” Jones was a little startled at\r\nthis sudden declaration. “I your enemy, sir!” says he, with much\r\namazement, and some sternness in his look. “Nay, be not angry,” said\r\nBenjamin, “for I promise you I am not. You are perfectly innocent of\r\nhaving intended me any wrong; for you was then an infant: but I shall,\r\nI believe, unriddle all this the moment I mention my name. Did you\r\nnever hear, sir, of one Partridge, who had the honour of being reputed\r\nyour father, and the misfortune of being ruined by that honour?” “I\r\nhave, indeed, heard of that Partridge,” says Jones, “and have always\r\nbelieved myself to be his son.” “Well, sir,” answered Benjamin, “I am\r\nthat Partridge; but I here absolve you from all filial duty, for I do\r\nassure you, you are no son of mine.” “How!” replied Jones, “and is it\r\npossible that a false suspicion should have drawn all the ill\r\nconsequences upon you, with which I am too well acquainted?” “It is\r\npossible,” cries Benjamin, “for it is so: but though it is natural\r\nenough for men to hate even the innocent causes of their sufferings,\r\nyet I am of a different temper. I have loved you ever since I heard of\r\nyour behaviour to Black George, as I told you; and I am convinced,\r\nfrom this extraordinary meeting, that you are born to make me amends\r\nfor all I have suffered on that account. Besides, I dreamt, the night\r\nbefore I saw you, that I stumbled over a stool without hurting myself;\r\nwhich plainly showed me something good was towards me: and last night\r\nI dreamt again, that I rode behind you on a milk-white mare, which is\r\na very excellent dream, and betokens much good fortune, which I am\r\nresolved to pursue unless you have the cruelty to deny me.”\r\n\r\n“I should be very glad, Mr Partridge,” answered Jones, “to have it in\r\nmy power to make you amends for your sufferings on my account, though\r\nat present I see no likelihood of it; however, I assure you I will\r\ndeny you nothing which is in my power to grant.”\r\n\r\n“It is in your power sure enough,” replied Benjamin; “for I desire\r\nnothing more than leave to attend you in this expedition. Nay, I have\r\nso entirely set my heart upon it, that if you should refuse me, you\r\nwill kill both a barber and a surgeon in one breath.”\r\n\r\nJones answered, smiling, that he should be very sorry to be the\r\noccasion of so much mischief to the public. He then advanced many\r\nprudential reasons, in order to dissuade Benjamin (whom we shall\r\nhereafter call Partridge) from his purpose; but all were in vain.\r\nPartridge relied strongly on his dream of the milk-white mare.\r\n“Besides, sir,” says he, “I promise you I have as good an inclination\r\nto the cause as any man can possibly have; and go I will, whether you\r\nadmit me to go in your company or not.”\r\n\r\nJones, who was as much pleased with Partridge as Partridge could be\r\nwith him, and who had not consulted his own inclination but the good\r\nof the other in desiring him to stay behind, when he found his friend\r\nso resolute, at last gave his consent; but then recollecting himself,\r\nhe said, “Perhaps, Mr Partridge, you think I shall be able to support\r\nyou, but I really am not;” and then taking out his purse, he told out\r\nnine guineas, which he declared were his whole fortune.\r\n\r\nPartridge answered, “That his dependence was only on his future\r\nfavour; for he was thoroughly convinced he would shortly have enough\r\nin his power. At present, sir,” said he, “I believe I am rather the\r\nricher man of the two; but all I have is at your service, and at your\r\ndisposal. I insist upon your taking the whole, and I beg only to\r\nattend you in the quality of your servant; _Nil desperandum est Teucro\r\nduce et auspice Teucro_”: but to this generous proposal concerning the\r\nmoney, Jones would by no means submit.\r\n\r\nIt was resolved to set out the next morning, when a difficulty arose\r\nconcerning the baggage; for the portmanteau of Mr Jones was too large\r\nto be carried without a horse.\r\n\r\n“If I may presume to give my advice,” says Partridge, “this\r\nportmanteau, with everything in it, except a few shirts, should be\r\nleft behind. Those I shall be easily able to carry for you, and the\r\nrest of your cloaths will remain very safe locked up in my house.”\r\n\r\nThis method was no sooner proposed than agreed to; and then the barber\r\ndeparted, in order to prepare everything for his intended expedition."

      "title": "Chapter vii.",
      "content": "Containing better reasons than any which have yet appeared for the\r\nconduct of Partridge; an apology for the weakness of Jones; and some\r\nfurther anecdotes concerning my landlady.\r\n\nThough Partridge was one of the most superstitious of men, he would\r\nhardly perhaps have desired to accompany Jones on his expedition\r\nmerely from the omens of the joint-stool and white mare, if his\r\nprospect had been no better than to have shared the plunder gained in\r\nthe field of battle. In fact, when Partridge came to ruminate on the\r\nrelation he had heard from Jones, he could not reconcile to himself\r\nthat Mr Allworthy should turn his son (for so he most firmly believed\r\nhim to be) out of doors, for any reason which he had heard assigned.\r\nHe concluded, therefore, that the whole was a fiction, and that Jones,\r\nof whom he had often from his correspondents heard the wildest\r\ncharacter, had in reality run away from his father. It came into his\r\nhead, therefore, that if he could prevail with the young gentleman to\r\nreturn back to his father, he should by that means render a service to\r\nAllworthy, which would obliterate all his former anger; nay, indeed,\r\nhe conceived that very anger was counterfeited, and that Allworthy had\r\nsacrificed him to his own reputation. And this suspicion indeed he\r\nwell accounted for, from the tender behaviour of that excellent man to\r\nthe foundling child; from his great severity to Partridge, who,\r\nknowing himself to be innocent, could not conceive that any other\r\nshould think him guilty; lastly, from the allowance which he had\r\nprivately received long after the annuity had been publickly taken\r\nfrom him, and which he looked upon as a kind of smart-money, or rather\r\nby way of atonement for injustice; for it is very uncommon, I believe,\r\nfor men to ascribe the benefactions they receive to pure charity, when\r\nthey can possibly impute them to any other motive. If he could by any\r\nmeans therefore persuade the young gentleman to return home, he\r\ndoubted not but that he should again be received into the favour of\r\nAllworthy, and well rewarded for his pains; nay, and should be again\r\nrestored to his native country; a restoration which Ulysses himself\r\nnever wished more heartily than poor Partridge.\r\n\r\nAs for Jones, he was well satisfied with the truth of what the other\r\nhad asserted, and believed that Partridge had no other inducements but\r\nlove to him, and zeal for the cause; a blameable want of caution and\r\ndiffidence in the veracity of others, in which he was highly worthy of\r\ncensure. To say the truth, there are but two ways by which men become\r\npossessed of this excellent quality. The one is from long experience,\r\nand the other is from nature; which last, I presume, is often meant by\r\ngenius, or great natural parts; and it is infinitely the better of the\r\ntwo, not only as we are masters of it much earlier in life, but as it\r\nis much more infallible and conclusive; for a man who hath been\r\nimposed on by ever so many, may still hope to find others more honest;\r\nwhereas he who receives certain necessary admonitions from within,\r\nthat this is impossible, must have very little understanding indeed,\r\nif he ever renders himself liable to be once deceived. As Jones had\r\nnot this gift from nature, he was too young to have gained it by\r\nexperience; for at the diffident wisdom which is to be acquired this\r\nway, we seldom arrive till very late in life; which is perhaps the\r\nreason why some old men are apt to despise the understandings of all\r\nthose who are a little younger than themselves.\r\n\r\nJones spent most part of the day in the company of a new acquaintance.\r\nThis was no other than the landlord of the house, or rather the\r\nhusband of the landlady. He had but lately made his descent\r\ndownstairs, after a long fit of the gout, in which distemper he was\r\ngenerally confined to his room during one half of the year; and during\r\nthe rest, he walked about the house, smoaked his pipe, and drank his\r\nbottle with his friends, without concerning himself in the least with\r\nany kind of business. He had been bred, as they call it, a gentleman;\r\nthat is, bred up to do nothing; and had spent a very small fortune,\r\nwhich he inherited from an industrious farmer his uncle, in hunting,\r\nhorse-racing, and cock-fighting, and had been married by my landlady\r\nfor certain purposes, which he had long since desisted from answering;\r\nfor which she hated him heartily. But as he was a surly kind of\r\nfellow, so she contented herself with frequently upbraiding him by\r\ndisadvantageous comparisons with her first husband, whose praise she\r\nhad eternally in her mouth; and as she was for the most part mistress\r\nof the profit, so she was satisfied to take upon herself the care and\r\ngovernment of the family, and, after a long successless struggle, to\r\nsuffer her husband to be master of himself.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, when Jones retired to his room, a small dispute arose\r\nbetween this fond couple concerning him:--“What,” says the wife, “you\r\nhave been tippling with the gentleman, I see?”--“Yes,” answered the\r\nhusband, “we have cracked a bottle together, and a very gentlemanlike\r\nman he is, and hath a very pretty notion of horse-flesh. Indeed, he is\r\nyoung, and hath not seen much of the world; for I believe he hath been\r\nat very few horse-races.”--“Oho! he is one of your order, is he?”\r\n replies the landlady: “he must be a gentleman to be sure, if he is a\r\nhorse-racer. The devil fetch such gentry! I am sure I wish I had never\r\nseen any of them. I have reason to love horse-racers truly!”--“That\r\nyou have,” says the husband; “for I was one, you know.”--“Yes,”\r\n answered she, “you are a pure one indeed. As my first husband used to\r\nsay, I may put all the good I have ever got by you in my eyes, and see\r\nnever the worse.”--“D--n your first husband!” cries he. “Don't d--n a\r\nbetter man than yourself,” answered the wife: “if he had been alive,\r\nyou durst not have done it.”--“Then you think,” says he, “I have not\r\nso much courage as yourself; for you have d--n'd him often in my\r\nhearing.”--“If I did,” says she, “I have repented of it many's the\r\ngood time and oft. And if he was so good to forgive me a word spoken\r\nin haste or so, it doth not become such a one as you to twitter me. He\r\nwas a husband to me, he was; and if ever I did make use of an ill word\r\nor so in a passion, I never called him rascal; I should have told a\r\nlie, if I had called him rascal.” Much more she said, but not in his\r\nhearing; for having lighted his pipe, he staggered off as fast as he\r\ncould. We shall therefore transcribe no more of her speech, as it\r\napproached still nearer and nearer to a subject too indelicate to find\r\nany place in this history.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning Partridge appeared at the bedside of Jones, ready\r\nequipped for the journey, with his knapsack at his back. This was his\r\nown workmanship; for besides his other trades, he was no indifferent\r\ntaylor. He had already put up his whole stock of linen in it,\r\nconsisting of four shirts, to which he now added eight for Mr Jones;\r\nand then packing up the portmanteau, he was departing with it towards\r\nhis own house, but was stopt in his way by the landlady, who refused\r\nto suffer any removals till after the payment of the reckoning.\r\n\r\nThe landlady was, as we have said, absolute governess in these\r\nregions; it was therefore necessary to comply with her rules; so the\r\nbill was presently writ out, which amounted to a much larger sum than\r\nmight have been expected, from the entertainment which Jones had met\r\nwith. But here we are obliged to disclose some maxims, which publicans\r\nhold to be the grand mysteries of their trade. The first is, If they\r\nhave anything good in their house (which indeed very seldom happens)\r\nto produce it only to persons who travel with great equipages. 2dly,\r\nTo charge the same for the very worst provisions, as if they were the\r\nbest. And lastly, If any of their guests call but for little, to make\r\nthem pay a double price for everything they have; so that the amount\r\nby the head may be much the same.\r\n\r\nThe bill being made and discharged, Jones set forward with Partridge,\r\ncarrying his knapsack; nor did the landlady condescend to wish him a\r\ngood journey; for this was, it seems, an inn frequented by people of\r\nfashion; and I know not whence it is, but all those who get their\r\nlivelihood by people of fashion, contract as much insolence to the\r\nrest of mankind, as if they really belonged to that rank themselves."

      "content": "Jones arrives at Gloucester, and goes to the Bell; the character of\r\nthat house, and of a petty-fogger which he there meets with.\r\n\nMr Jones and Partridge, or Little Benjamin (which epithet of Little\r\nwas perhaps given him ironically, he being in reality near six feet\r\nhigh), having left their last quarters in the manner before described,\r\ntravelled on to Gloucester without meeting any adventure worth\r\nrelating.\r\n\r\nBeing arrived here, they chose for their house of entertainment the\r\nsign of the Bell, an excellent house indeed, and which I do most\r\nseriously recommend to every reader who shall visit this antient city.\r\nThe master of it is brother to the great preacher Whitefield; but is\r\nabsolutely untainted with the pernicious principles of Methodism, or\r\nof any other heretical sect. He is indeed a very honest plain man,\r\nand, in my opinion, not likely to create any disturbance either in\r\nchurch or state. His wife hath, I believe, had much pretension to\r\nbeauty, and is still a very fine woman. Her person and deportment\r\nmight have made a shining figure in the politest assemblies; but\r\nthough she must be conscious of this and many other perfections, she\r\nseems perfectly contented with, and resigned to, that state of life to\r\nwhich she is called; and this resignation is entirely owing to the\r\nprudence and wisdom of her temper; for she is at present as free from\r\nany Methodistical notions as her husband: I say at present; for she\r\nfreely confesses that her brother's documents made at first some\r\nimpression upon her, and that she had put herself to the expense of a\r\nlong hood, in order to attend the extraordinary emotions of the\r\nSpirit; but having found, during an experiment of three weeks, no\r\nemotions, she says, worth a farthing, she very wisely laid by her\r\nhood, and abandoned the sect. To be concise, she is a very friendly\r\ngood-natured woman; and so industrious to oblige, that the guests must\r\nbe of a very morose disposition who are not extremely well satisfied\r\nin her house.\r\n\r\nMrs Whitefield happened to be in the yard when Jones and his attendant\r\nmarched in. Her sagacity soon discovered in the air of our heroe\r\nsomething which distinguished him from the vulgar. She ordered her\r\nservants, therefore, immediately to show him into a room, and\r\npresently afterwards invited him to dinner with herself; which\r\ninvitation he very thankfully accepted; for indeed much less agreeable\r\ncompany than that of Mrs Whitefield, and a much worse entertainment\r\nthan she had provided, would have been welcome after so long fasting\r\nand so long a walk.\r\n\r\nBesides Mr Jones and the good governess of the mansion, there sat down\r\nat table an attorney of Salisbury, indeed the very same who had\r\nbrought the news of Mrs Blifil's death to Mr Allworthy, and whose\r\nname, which I think we did not before mention, was Dowling: there was\r\nlikewise present another person, who stiled himself a lawyer, and who\r\nlived somewhere near Linlinch, in Somersetshire. This fellow, I say,\r\nstiled himself a lawyer, but was indeed a most vile petty-fogger,\r\nwithout sense or knowledge of any kind; one of those who may be termed\r\ntrain-bearers to the law; a sort of supernumeraries in the profession,\r\nwho are the hackneys of attorneys, and will ride more miles for\r\nhalf-a-crown than a postboy.\r\n\r\nDuring the time of dinner, the Somersetshire lawyer recollected the\r\nface of Jones, which he had seen at Mr Allworthy's; for he had often\r\nvisited in that gentleman's kitchen. He therefore took occasion to\r\nenquire after the good family there with that familiarity which would\r\nhave become an intimate friend or acquaintance of Mr Allworthy; and\r\nindeed he did all in his power to insinuate himself to be such, though\r\nhe had never had the honour of speaking to any person in that family\r\nhigher than the butler. Jones answered all his questions with much\r\ncivility, though he never remembered to have seen the petty-fogger\r\nbefore; and though he concluded, from the outward appearance and\r\nbehaviour of the man, that he usurped a freedom with his betters, to\r\nwhich he was by no means intitled.\r\n\r\nAs the conversation of fellows of this kind is of all others the most\r\ndetestable to men of any sense, the cloth was no sooner removed than\r\nMr Jones withdrew, and a little barbarously left poor Mrs Whitefield\r\nto do a penance, which I have often heard Mr Timothy Harris, and other\r\npublicans of good taste, lament, as the severest lot annexed to their\r\ncalling, namely, that of being obliged to keep company with their\r\nguests.\r\n\r\nJones had no sooner quitted the room, than the petty-fogger, in a\r\nwhispering tone, asked Mrs Whitefield, “If she knew who that fine\r\nspark was?” She answered, “She had never seen the gentleman\r\nbefore.”--“The gentleman, indeed!” replied the petty-fogger; “a pretty\r\ngentleman, truly! Why, he's the bastard of a fellow who was hanged for\r\nhorse-stealing. He was dropt at Squire Allworthy's door, where one of\r\nthe servants found him in a box so full of rain-water, that he would\r\ncertainly have been drowned, had he not been reserved for another\r\nfate.”--“Ay, ay, you need not mention it, I protest: we understand\r\nwhat that fate is very well,” cries Dowling, with a most facetious\r\ngrin.--“Well,” continued the other, “the squire ordered him to be\r\ntaken in; for he is a timbersome man everybody knows, and was afraid\r\nof drawing himself into a scrape; and there the bastard was bred up,\r\nand fed, and cloathified all to the world like any gentleman; and\r\nthere he got one of the servant-maids with child, and persuaded her to\r\nswear it to the squire himself; and afterwards he broke the arm of one\r\nMr Thwackum a clergyman, only because he reprimanded him for following\r\nwhores; and afterwards he snapt a pistol at Mr Blifil behind his back;\r\nand once, when Squire Allworthy was sick, he got a drum, and beat it\r\nall over the house to prevent him from sleeping; and twenty other\r\npranks he hath played, for all which, about four or five days ago,\r\njust before I left the country, the squire stripped him stark naked,\r\nand turned him out of doors.”\r\n\r\n“And very justly too, I protest,” cries Dowling; “I would turn my own\r\nson out of doors, if he was guilty of half as much. And pray what is\r\nthe name of this pretty gentleman?”\r\n\r\n“The name o' un?” answered Petty-fogger; “why, he is called Thomas\r\nJones.”\r\n\r\n“Jones!” answered Dowling a little eagerly; “what, Mr Jones that lived\r\nat Mr Allworthy's? was that the gentleman that dined with us?”--“The\r\nvery same,” said the other. “I have heard of the gentleman,” cries\r\nDowling, “often; but I never heard any ill character of him.”--“And I\r\nam sure,” says Mrs Whitefield, “if half what this gentleman hath said\r\nbe true, Mr Jones hath the most deceitful countenance I ever saw; for\r\nsure his looks promise something very different; and I must say, for\r\nthe little I have seen of him, he is as civil a well-bred man as you\r\nwould wish to converse with.”\r\n\r\nPetty-fogger calling to mind that he had not been sworn, as he usually\r\nwas, before he gave his evidence, now bound what he had declared with\r\nso many oaths and imprecations that the landlady's ears were shocked,\r\nand she put a stop to his swearing, by assuring him of her belief.\r\nUpon which he said, “I hope, madam, you imagine I would scorn to tell\r\nsuch things of any man, unless I knew them to be true. What interest\r\nhave I in taking away the reputation of a man who never injured me? I\r\npromise you every syllable of what I have said is fact, and the whole\r\ncountry knows it.”\r\n\r\nAs Mrs Whitefield had no reason to suspect that the petty-fogger had\r\nany motive or temptation to abuse Jones, the reader cannot blame her\r\nfor believing what he so confidently affirmed with many oaths. She\r\naccordingly gave up her skill in physiognomy, and hence-forwards\r\nconceived so ill an opinion of her guest, that she heartily wished him\r\nout of her house.\r\n\r\nThis dislike was now farther increased by a report which Mr Whitefield\r\nmade from the kitchen, where Partridge had informed the company, “That\r\nthough he carried the knapsack, and contented himself with staying\r\namong servants, while Tom Jones (as he called him) was regaling in the\r\nparlour, he was not his servant, but only a friend and companion, and\r\nas good a gentleman as Mr Jones himself.”\r\n\r\nDowling sat all this while silent, biting his fingers, making faces,\r\ngrinning, and looking wonderfully arch; at last he opened his lips,\r\nand protested that the gentleman looked like another sort of man. He\r\nthen called for his bill with the utmost haste, declared he must be at\r\nHereford that evening, lamented his great hurry of business, and\r\nwished he could divide himself into twenty pieces, in order to be at\r\nonce in twenty places.\r\n\r\nThe petty-fogger now likewise departed, and then Jones desired the\r\nfavour of Mrs Whitefield's company to drink tea with him; but she\r\nrefused, and with a manner so different from that with which she had\r\nreceived him at dinner, that it a little surprized him. And now he\r\nsoon perceived her behaviour totally changed; for instead of that\r\nnatural affability which we have before celebrated, she wore a\r\nconstrained severity on her countenance, which was so disagreeable to\r\nMr Jones, that he resolved, however late, to quit the house that\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nHe did indeed account somewhat unfairly for this sudden change; for\r\nbesides some hard and unjust surmises concerning female fickleness and\r\nmutability, he began to suspect that he owed this want of civility to\r\nhis want of horses; a sort of animals which, as they dirty no sheets,\r\nare thought in inns to pay better for their beds than their riders,\r\nand are therefore considered as the more desirable company; but Mrs\r\nWhitefield, to do her justice, had a much more liberal way of\r\nthinking. She was perfectly well-bred, and could be very civil to a\r\ngentleman, though he walked on foot. In reality, she looked on our\r\nheroe as a sorry scoundrel, and therefore treated him as such, for\r\nwhich not even Jones himself, had he known as much as the reader,\r\ncould have blamed her; nay, on the contrary, he must have approved her\r\nconduct, and have esteemed her the more for the disrespect shown\r\ntowards himself. This is indeed a most aggravating circumstance, which\r\nattends depriving men unjustly of their reputation; for a man who is\r\nconscious of having an ill character, cannot justly be angry with\r\nthose who neglect and slight him; but ought rather to despise such as\r\naffect his conversation, unless where a perfect intimacy must have\r\nconvinced them that their friend's character hath been falsely and\r\ninjuriously aspersed.\r\n\r\nThis was not, however, the case of Jones; for as he was a perfect\r\nstranger to the truth, so he was with good reason offended at the\r\ntreatment he received. He therefore paid his reckoning and departed,\r\nhighly against the will of Mr Partridge, who having remonstrated much\r\nagainst it to no purpose, at last condescended to take up his knapsack\r\nand to attend his friend."

      "content": "Containing several dialogues between Jones and Partridge, concerning\r\nlove, cold, hunger, and other matters; with the lucky and narrow\r\nescape of Partridge, as he was on the very brink of making a fatal\r\ndiscovery to his friend.\r\n\nThe shadows began now to descend larger from the high mountains; the\r\nfeathered creation had betaken themselves to their rest. Now the\r\nhighest order of mortals were sitting down to their dinners, and the\r\nlowest order to their suppers. In a word, the clock struck five just\r\nas Mr Jones took his leave of Gloucester; an hour at which (as it was\r\nnow mid-winter) the dirty fingers of Night would have drawn her sable\r\ncurtain over the universe, had not the moon forbid her, who now, with\r\na face as broad and as red as those of some jolly mortals, who, like\r\nher, turn night into day, began to rise from her bed, where she had\r\nslumbered away the day, in order to sit up all night. Jones had not\r\ntravelled far before he paid his compliments to that beautiful planet,\r\nand, turning to his companion, asked him if he had ever beheld so\r\ndelicious an evening? Partridge making no ready answer to his\r\nquestion, he proceeded to comment on the beauty of the moon, and\r\nrepeated some passages from Milton, who hath certainly excelled all\r\nother poets in his description of the heavenly luminaries. He then\r\ntold Partridge the story from the Spectator, of two lovers who had\r\nagreed to entertain themselves when they were at a great distance from\r\neach other, by repairing, at a certain fixed hour, to look at the\r\nmoon; thus pleasing themselves with the thought that they were both\r\nemployed in contemplating the same object at the same time. “Those\r\nlovers,” added he, “must have had souls truly capable of feeling all\r\nthe tenderness of the sublimest of all human passions.”--“Very\r\nprobably,” cries Partridge: “but I envy them more, if they had bodies\r\nincapable of feeling cold; for I am almost frozen to death, and am\r\nvery much afraid I shall lose a piece of my nose before we get to\r\nanother house of entertainment. Nay, truly, we may well expect some\r\njudgment should happen to us for our folly in running away so by night\r\nfrom one of the most excellent inns I ever set my foot into. I am sure\r\nI never saw more good things in my life, and the greatest lord in the\r\nland cannot live better in his own house than he may there. And to\r\nforsake such a house, and go a rambling about the country, the Lord\r\nknows whither, _per devia rura viarum_, I say nothing for my part; but\r\nsome people might not have charity enough to conclude we were in our\r\nsober senses.”--“Fie upon it, Mr Partridge!” says Jones, “have a\r\nbetter heart; consider you are going to face an enemy; and are you\r\nafraid of facing a little cold? I wish, indeed, we had a guide to\r\nadvise which of these roads we should take.”--“May I be so bold,” says\r\nPartridge, “to offer my advice? _Interdum stultus opportuna\r\nloquitur_”--“Why, which of them,” cries Jones, “would you\r\nrecommend?”--“Truly neither of them,” answered Partridge. “The only\r\nroad we can be certain of finding, is the road we came. A good hearty\r\npace will bring us back to Gloucester in an hour; but if we go\r\nforward, the Lord Harry knows when we shall arrive at any place; for I\r\nsee at least fifty miles before me, and no house in all the\r\nway.”--“You see, indeed, a very fair prospect,” says Jones, “which\r\nreceives great additional beauty from the extreme lustre of the moon.\r\nHowever, I will keep the left-hand track, as that seems to lead\r\ndirectly to those hills, which we were informed lie not far from\r\nWorcester. And here, if you are inclined to quit me, you may, and\r\nreturn back again; but for my part, I am resolved to go forward.”\r\n\r\n“It is unkind in you, sir,” says Partridge, “to suspect me of any such\r\nintention. What I have advised hath been as much on your account as on\r\nmy own: but since you are determined to go on, I am as much determined\r\nto follow. _I prae sequar te_.”\r\n\r\nThey now travelled some miles without speaking to each other, during\r\nwhich suspense of discourse Jones often sighed, and Benjamin groaned\r\nas bitterly, though from a very different reason. At length Jones made\r\na full stop, and turning about, cries, “Who knows, Partridge, but the\r\nloveliest creature in the universe may have her eyes now fixed on that\r\nvery moon which I behold at this instant?” “Very likely, sir,”\r\n answered Partridge; “and if my eyes were fixed on a good surloin of\r\nroast beef, the devil might take the moon and her horns into the\r\nbargain.” “Did ever Tramontane make such an answer?” cries Jones.\r\n“Prithee, Partridge, wast thou ever susceptible of love in thy life,\r\nor hath time worn away all the traces of it from thy memory?”\r\n “Alack-a-day!” cries Partridge, “well would it have been for me if I\r\nhad never known what love was. _Infandum regina jubes renovare\r\ndolorem_. I am sure I have tasted all the tenderness, and sublimities,\r\nand bitternesses of the passion.” “Was your mistress unkind, then?”\r\n says Jones. “Very unkind, indeed, sir,” answered Partridge; “for she\r\nmarried me, and made one of the most confounded wives in the world.\r\nHowever, heaven be praised, she's gone; and if I believed she was in\r\nthe moon, according to a book I once read, which teaches that to be\r\nthe receptacle of departed spirits, I would never look at it for fear\r\nof seeing her; but I wish, sir, that the moon was a looking-glass for\r\nyour sake, and that Miss Sophia Western was now placed before it.” “My\r\ndear Partridge,” cries Jones, “what a thought was there! A thought\r\nwhich I am certain could never have entered into any mind but that of\r\na lover. O Partridge! could I hope once again to see that face; but,\r\nalas! all those golden dreams are vanished for ever, and my only\r\nrefuge from future misery is to forget the object of all my former\r\nhappiness.” “And do you really despair of ever seeing Miss Western\r\nagain?” answered Partridge; “if you will follow my advice I will\r\nengage you shall not only see her but have her in your arms.” “Ha! do\r\nnot awaken a thought of that nature,” cries Jones: “I have struggled\r\nsufficiently to conquer all such wishes already.” “Nay,” answered\r\nPartridge, “if you do not wish to have your mistress in your arms you\r\nare a most extraordinary lover indeed.” “Well, well,” says Jones, “let\r\nus avoid this subject; but pray what is your advice?” “To give it you\r\nin the military phrase, then,” says Partridge, “as we are soldiers,\r\n`To the right about.' Let us return the way we came; we may yet reach\r\nGloucester to-night, though late; whereas, if we proceed, we are\r\nlikely, for aught I see, to ramble about for ever without coming\r\neither to house or home.” “I have already told you my resolution is to\r\ngo on,” answered Jones; “but I would have you go back. I am obliged to\r\nyou for your company hither; and I beg you to accept a guinea as a\r\nsmall instance of my gratitude. Nay, it would be cruel in me to suffer\r\nyou to go any farther; for, to deal plainly with you, my chief end and\r\ndesire is a glorious death in the service of my king and country.” “As\r\nfor your money,” replied Partridge, “I beg, sir, you will put it up; I\r\nwill receive none of you at this time; for at present I am, I believe,\r\nthe richer man of the two. And as your resolution is to go on, so mine\r\nis to follow you if you do. Nay, now my presence appears absolutely\r\nnecessary to take care of you, since your intentions are so desperate;\r\nfor I promise you my views are much more prudent; as you are resolved\r\nto fall in battle if you can, so I am resolved as firmly to come to no\r\nhurt if I can help it. And, indeed, I have the comfort to think there\r\nwill be but little danger; for a popish priest told me the other day\r\nthe business would soon be over, and he believed without a battle.” “A\r\npopish priest!” cries Jones, “I have heard is not always to be\r\nbelieved when he speaks in behalf of his religion.” “Yes, but so far,”\r\n answered the other, “from speaking in behalf of his religion, he\r\nassured me the Catholicks did not expect to be any gainers by the\r\nchange; for that Prince Charles was as good a Protestant as any in\r\nEngland; and that nothing but regard to right made him and the rest of\r\nthe popish party to be Jacobites.”--“I believe him to be as much a\r\nProtestant as I believe he hath any right,” says Jones; “and I make no\r\ndoubt of our success, but not without a battle. So that I am not so\r\nsanguine as your friend the popish priest.” “Nay, to be sure, sir,”\r\n answered Partridge, “all the prophecies I have ever read speak of a\r\ngreat deal of blood to be spilt in the quarrel, and the miller with\r\nthree thumbs, who is now alive, is to hold the horses of three kings,\r\nup to his knees in blood. Lord, have mercy upon us all, and send\r\nbetter times!” “With what stuff and nonsense hast thou filled thy\r\nhead!” answered Jones: “this too, I suppose, comes from the popish\r\npriest. Monsters and prodigies are the proper arguments to support\r\nmonstrous and absurd doctrines. The cause of King George is the cause\r\nof liberty and true religion. In other words, it is the cause of\r\ncommon sense, my boy, and I warrant you will succeed, though Briarius\r\nhimself was to rise again with his hundred thumbs, and to turn\r\nmiller.” Partridge made no reply to this. He was, indeed, cast into\r\nthe utmost confusion by this declaration of Jones. For, to inform the\r\nreader of a secret, which he had no proper opportunity of revealing\r\nbefore, Partridge was in truth a Jacobite, and had concluded that\r\nJones was of the same party, and was now proceeding to join the\r\nrebels. An opinion which was not without foundation. For the tall,\r\nlong-sided dame, mentioned by Hudibras--that many-eyed, many-tongued,\r\nmany-mouthed, many-eared monster of Virgil, had related the story of\r\nthe quarrel between Jones and the officer, with the usual regard to\r\ntruth. She had, indeed, changed the name of Sophia into that of the\r\nPretender, and had reported, that drinking his health was the cause\r\nfor which Jones was knocked down. This Partridge had heard, and most\r\nfirmly believed. 'Tis no wonder, therefore, that he had thence\r\nentertained the above-mentioned opinion of Jones; and which he had\r\nalmost discovered to him before he found out his own mistake. And at\r\nthis the reader will be the less inclined to wonder, if he pleases to\r\nrecollect the doubtful phrase in which Jones first communicated his\r\nresolution to Mr Partridge; and, indeed, had the words been less\r\nambiguous, Partridge might very well have construed them as he did;\r\nbeing persuaded as he was that the whole nation were of the same\r\ninclination in their hearts; nor did it stagger him that Jones had\r\ntravelled in the company of soldiers; for he had the same opinion of\r\nthe army which he had of the rest of the people.\r\n\r\nBut however well affected he might be to James or Charles, he was\r\nstill much more attached to Little Benjamin than to either; for which\r\nreason he no sooner discovered the principles of his fellow-traveller\r\nthan he thought proper to conceal and outwardly give up his own to the\r\nman on whom he depended for the making his fortune, since he by no\r\nmeans believed the affairs of Jones to be so desperate as they really\r\nwere with Mr Allworthy; for as he had kept a constant correspondence\r\nwith some of his neighbours since he left that country, he had heard\r\nmuch, indeed more than was true, of the great affection Mr Allworthy\r\nbore this young man, who, as Partridge had been instructed, was to be\r\nthat gentleman's heir, and whom, as we have said, he did not in the\r\nleast doubt to be his son.\r\n\r\nHe imagined therefore that whatever quarrel was between them, it would\r\nbe certainly made up at the return of Mr Jones; an event from which he\r\npromised great advantages, if he could take this opportunity of\r\ningratiating himself with that young gentleman; and if he could by any\r\nmeans be instrumental in procuring his return, he doubted not, as we\r\nhave before said, but it would as highly advance him in the favour of\r\nMr Allworthy.\r\n\r\nWe have already observed, that he was a very good-natured fellow, and\r\nhe hath himself declared the violent attachment he had to the person\r\nand character of Jones; but possibly the views which I have just\r\nbefore mentioned, might likewise have some little share in prompting\r\nhim to undertake this expedition, at least in urging him to continue\r\nit, after he had discovered that his master and himself, like some\r\nprudent fathers and sons, though they travelled together in great\r\nfriendship, had embraced opposite parties. I am led into this\r\nconjecture, by having remarked, that though love, friendship, esteem,\r\nand such like, have very powerful operations in the human mind;\r\ninterest, however, is an ingredient seldom omitted by wise men, when\r\nthey would work others to their own purposes. This is indeed a most\r\nexcellent medicine, and, like Ward's pill, flies at once to the\r\nparticular part of the body on which you desire to operate, whether it\r\nbe the tongue, the hand, or any other member, where it scarce ever\r\nfails of immediately producing the desired effect."

      "title": "Chapter x.",
      "content": "In which our travellers meet with a very extraordinary adventure.\r\n\nJust as Jones and his friend came to the end of their dialogue in the\r\npreceding chapter, they arrived at the bottom of a very steep hill.\r\nHere Jones stopt short, and directing his eyes upwards, stood for a\r\nwhile silent. At length he called to his companion, and said,\r\n“Partridge, I wish I was at the top of this hill; it must certainly\r\nafford a most charming prospect, especially by this light; for the\r\nsolemn gloom which the moon casts on all objects, is beyond expression\r\nbeautiful, especially to an imagination which is desirous of\r\ncultivating melancholy ideas.”--“Very probably,” answered Partridge;\r\n“but if the top of the hill be properest to produce melancholy\r\nthoughts, I suppose the bottom is the likeliest to produce merry ones,\r\nand these I take to be much the better of the two. I protest you have\r\nmade my blood run cold with the very mentioning the top of that\r\nmountain; which seems to me to be one of the highest in the world. No,\r\nno, if we look for anything, let it be for a place under ground, to\r\nscreen ourselves from the frost.”--“Do so,” said Jones; “let it be but\r\nwithin hearing of this place, and I will hallow to you at my return\r\nback.”--“Surely, sir, you are not mad,” said Partridge.--“Indeed, I\r\nam,” answered Jones, “if ascending this hill be madness; but as you\r\ncomplain so much of the cold already, I would have you stay below. I\r\nwill certainly return to you within an hour.”--“Pardon me, sir,” cries\r\nPartridge; “I have determined to follow you wherever you go.” Indeed\r\nhe was now afraid to stay behind; for though he was coward enough in\r\nall respects, yet his chief fear was that of ghosts, with which the\r\npresent time of night, and the wildness of the place, extremely well\r\nsuited.\r\n\r\nAt this instant Partridge espied a glimmering light through some\r\ntrees, which seemed very near to them. He immediately cried out in a\r\nrapture, “Oh, sir! Heaven hath at last heard my prayers, and hath\r\nbrought us to a house; perhaps it may be an inn. Let me beseech you,\r\nsir, if you have any compassion either for me or yourself, do not\r\ndespise the goodness of Providence, but let us go directly to yon\r\nlight. Whether it be a public-house or no, I am sure if they be\r\nChristians that dwell there, they will not refuse a little house-room\r\nto persons in our miserable condition.” Jones at length yielded to the\r\nearnest supplications of Partridge, and both together made directly\r\ntowards the place whence the light issued.\r\n\r\nThey soon arrived at the door of this house, or cottage, for it might\r\nbe called either, without much impropriety. Here Jones knocked several\r\ntimes without receiving any answer from within; at which Partridge,\r\nwhose head was full of nothing but of ghosts, devils, witches, and\r\nsuch like, began to tremble, crying, “Lord, have mercy upon us! surely\r\nthe people must be all dead. I can see no light neither now, and yet I\r\nam certain I saw a candle burning but a moment before.--Well! I have\r\nheard of such things.”--“What hast thou heard of?” said Jones. “The\r\npeople are either fast asleep, or probably, as this is a lonely place,\r\nare afraid to open their door.” He then began to vociferate pretty\r\nloudly, and at last an old woman, opening an upper casement, asked,\r\nWho they were, and what they wanted? Jones answered, They were\r\ntravellers who had lost their way, and having seen a light in the\r\nwindow, had been led thither in hopes of finding some fire to warm\r\nthemselves. “Whoever you are,” cries the woman, “you have no business\r\nhere; nor shall I open the door to any one at this time of night.”\r\n Partridge, whom the sound of a human voice had recovered from his\r\nfright, fell to the most earnest supplications to be admitted for a\r\nfew minutes to the fire, saying, he was almost dead with the cold; to\r\nwhich fear had indeed contributed equally with the frost. He assured\r\nher that the gentleman who spoke to her was one of the greatest\r\nsquires in the country; and made use of every argument, save one,\r\nwhich Jones afterwards effectually added; and this was, the promise of\r\nhalf-a-crown;--a bribe too great to be resisted by such a person,\r\nespecially as the genteel appearance of Jones, which the light of the\r\nmoon plainly discovered to her, together with his affable behaviour,\r\nhad entirely subdued those apprehensions of thieves which she had at\r\nfirst conceived. She agreed, therefore, at last, to let them in; where\r\nPartridge, to his infinite joy, found a good fire ready for his\r\nreception.\r\n\r\nThe poor fellow, however, had no sooner warmed himself, than those\r\nthoughts which were always uppermost in his mind, began a little to\r\ndisturb his brain. There was no article of his creed in which he had a\r\nstronger faith than he had in witchcraft, nor can the reader conceive\r\na figure more adapted to inspire this idea, than the old woman who now\r\nstood before him. She answered exactly to that picture drawn by Otway\r\nin his Orphan. Indeed, if this woman had lived in the reign of James\r\nthe First, her appearance alone would have hanged her, almost without\r\nany evidence.\r\n\r\nMany circumstances likewise conspired to confirm Partridge in his\r\nopinion. Her living, as he then imagined, by herself in so lonely a\r\nplace; and in a house, the outside of which seemed much too good for\r\nher, but its inside was furnished in the most neat and elegant manner.\r\nTo say the truth, Jones himself was not a little surprized at what he\r\nsaw; for, besides the extraordinary neatness of the room, it was\r\nadorned with a great number of nicknacks and curiosities, which might\r\nhave engaged the attention of a virtuoso.\r\n\r\nWhile Jones was admiring these things, and Partridge sat trembling\r\nwith the firm belief that he was in the house of a witch, the old\r\nwoman said, “I hope, gentlemen, you will make what haste you can; for\r\nI expect my master presently, and I would not for double the money he\r\nshould find you here.”--“Then you have a master?” cried Jones.\r\n“Indeed, you will excuse me, good woman, but I was surprized to see\r\nall those fine things in your house.”--“Ah, sir,” said she, “if the\r\ntwentieth part of these things were mine, I should think myself a rich\r\nwoman. But pray, sir, do not stay much longer, for I look for him in\r\nevery minute.”--“Why, sure he would not be angry with you,” said\r\nJones, “for doing a common act of charity?”--“Alack-a-day, sir!” said\r\nshe, “he is a strange man, not at all like other people. He keeps no\r\ncompany with anybody, and seldom walks out but by night, for he doth\r\nnot care to be seen; and all the country people are as much afraid of\r\nmeeting him; for his dress is enough to frighten those who are not\r\nused to it. They call him, the Man of the Hill (for there he walks by\r\nnight), and the country people are not, I believe, more afraid of the\r\ndevil himself. He would be terribly angry if he found you\r\nhere.”--“Pray, sir,” says Partridge, “don't let us offend the\r\ngentleman; I am ready to walk, and was never warmer in my life. Do\r\npray, sir, let us go. Here are pistols over the chimney: who knows\r\nwhether they be charged or no, or what he may do with them?”--“Fear\r\nnothing, Partridge,” cries Jones; “I will secure thee from\r\ndanger.”--“Nay, for matter o' that, he never doth any mischief,” said\r\nthe woman; “but to be sure it is necessary he should keep some arms\r\nfor his own safety; for his house hath been beset more than once; and\r\nit is not many nights ago that we thought we heard thieves about it:\r\nfor my own part, I have often wondered that he is not murdered by some\r\nvillain or other, as he walks out by himself at such hours; but then,\r\nas I said, the people are afraid of him; and besides, they think, I\r\nsuppose, he hath nothing about him worth taking.”--“I should imagine,\r\nby this collection of rarities,” cries Jones, “that your master had\r\nbeen a traveller.”--“Yes, sir,” answered she, “he hath been a very\r\ngreat one: there be few gentlemen that know more of all matters than\r\nhe. I fancy he hath been crost in love, or whatever it is I know not;\r\nbut I have lived with him above these thirty years, and in all that\r\ntime he hath hardly spoke to six living people.” She then again\r\nsolicited their departure, in which she was backed by Partridge; but\r\nJones purposely protracted the time, for his curiosity was greatly\r\nraised to see this extraordinary person. Though the old woman,\r\ntherefore, concluded every one of her answers with desiring him to be\r\ngone, and Partridge proceeded so far as to pull him by the sleeve, he\r\nstill continued to invent new questions, till the old woman, with an\r\naffrighted countenance, declared she heard her master's signal; and at\r\nthe same instant more than one voice was heard without the door,\r\ncrying, “D--n your blood, show us your money this instant. Your money,\r\nyou villain, or we will blow your brains about your ears.”\r\n\r\n“O, good heaven!” cries the old woman, “some villains, to be sure,\r\nhave attacked my master. O la! what shall I do? what shall I\r\ndo?”--“How!” cries Jones, “how!--Are these pistols loaded?”--“O, good\r\nsir, there is nothing in them, indeed. O pray don't murder us,\r\ngentlemen!” (for in reality she now had the same opinion of those\r\nwithin as she had of those without). Jones made her no answer; but\r\nsnatching an old broad sword which hung in the room, he instantly\r\nsallied out, where he found the old gentleman struggling with two\r\nruffians, and begging for mercy. Jones asked no questions, but fell so\r\nbriskly to work with his broad sword, that the fellows immediately\r\nquitted their hold; and without offering to attack our heroe, betook\r\nthemselves to their heels and made their escape; for he did not\r\nattempt to pursue them, being contented with having delivered the old\r\ngentleman; and indeed he concluded he had pretty well done their\r\nbusiness, for both of them, as they ran off, cried out with bitter\r\noaths that they were dead men.\r\n\r\nJones presently ran to lift up the old gentleman, who had been thrown\r\ndown in the scuffle, expressing at the same time great concern lest he\r\nshould have received any harm from the villains. The old man stared a\r\nmoment at Jones, and then cried, “No, sir, no, I have very little\r\nharm, I thank you. Lord have mercy upon me!”--“I see, sir,” said\r\nJones, “you are not free from apprehensions even of those who have had\r\nthe happiness to be your deliverers; nor can I blame any suspicions\r\nwhich you may have; but indeed you have no real occasion for any; here\r\nare none but your friends present. Having mist our way this cold\r\nnight, we took the liberty of warming ourselves at your fire, whence\r\nwe were just departing when we heard you call for assistance, which, I\r\nmust say, Providence alone seems to have sent you.”--“Providence,\r\nindeed,” cries the old gentleman, “if it be so.”--“So it is, I assure\r\nyou,” cries Jones. “Here is your own sword, sir; I have used it in\r\nyour defence, and I now return it into your hand.” The old man having\r\nreceived the sword, which was stained with the blood of his enemies,\r\nlooked stedfastly at Jones during some moments, and then with a sigh\r\ncried out, “You will pardon me, young gentleman; I was not always of a\r\nsuspicious temper, nor am I a friend to ingratitude.”\r\n\r\n“Be thankful then,” cries Jones, “to that Providence to which you owe\r\nyour deliverance: as to my part, I have only discharged the common\r\nduties of humanity, and what I would have done for any fellow-creature\r\nin your situation.”--“Let me look at you a little longer,” cries the\r\nold gentleman. “You are a human creature then? Well, perhaps you are.\r\nCome pray walk into my little hutt. You have been my deliverer\r\nindeed.”\r\n\r\nThe old woman was distracted between the fears which she had of her\r\nmaster, and for him; and Partridge was, if possible, in a greater\r\nfright. The former of these, however, when she heard her master speak\r\nkindly to Jones, and perceived what had happened, came again to\r\nherself; but Partridge no sooner saw the gentleman, than the\r\nstrangeness of his dress infused greater terrors into that poor fellow\r\nthan he had before felt, either from the strange description which he\r\nhad heard, or from the uproar which had happened at the door.\r\n\r\nTo say the truth, it was an appearance which might have affected a\r\nmore constant mind than that of Mr Partridge. This person was of the\r\ntallest size, with a long beard as white as snow. His body was\r\ncloathed with the skin of an ass, made something into the form of a\r\ncoat. He wore likewise boots on his legs, and a cap on his head, both\r\ncomposed of the skin of some other animals.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the old gentleman came into his house, the old woman began\r\nher congratulations on his happy escape from the ruffians. “Yes,”\r\n cried he, “I have escaped, indeed, thanks to my preserver.”--“O the\r\nblessing on him!” answered she: “he is a good gentleman, I warrant\r\nhim. I was afraid your worship would have been angry with me for\r\nletting him in; and to be certain I should not have done it, had not I\r\nseen by the moon-light, that he was a gentleman, and almost frozen to\r\ndeath. And to be certain it must have been some good angel that sent\r\nhim hither, and tempted me to do it.”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid, sir,” said the old gentleman to Jones, “that I have\r\nnothing in this house which you can either eat or drink, unless you\r\nwill accept a dram of brandy; of which I can give you some most\r\nexcellent, and which I have had by me these thirty years.” Jones\r\ndeclined this offer in a very civil and proper speech, and then the\r\nother asked him, “Whither he was travelling when he mist his way?”\r\n saying, “I must own myself surprized to see such a person as you\r\nappear to be, journeying on foot at this time of night. I suppose,\r\nsir, you are a gentleman of these parts; for you do not look like one\r\nwho is used to travel far without horses?”\r\n\r\n“Appearances,” cried Jones, “are often deceitful; men sometimes look\r\nwhat they are not. I assure you I am not of this country; and whither\r\nI am travelling, in reality I scarce know myself.”\r\n\r\n“Whoever you are, or whithersoever you are going,” answered the old\r\nman, “I have obligations to you which I can never return.”\r\n\r\n“I once more,” replied Jones, “affirm that you have none; for there\r\ncan be no merit in having hazarded that in your service on which I set\r\nno value; and nothing is so contemptible in my eyes as life.”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry, young gentleman,” answered the stranger, “that you have\r\nany reason to be so unhappy at your years.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed I am, sir,” answered Jones, “the most unhappy of\r\nmankind.”--“Perhaps you have had a friend, or a mistress?” replied the\r\nother. “How could you,” cries Jones, “mention two words sufficient to\r\ndrive me to distraction?”--“Either of them are enough to drive any man\r\nto distraction,” answered the old man. “I enquire no farther, sir;\r\nperhaps my curiosity hath led me too far already.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, sir,” cries Jones, “I cannot censure a passion which I feel\r\nat this instant in the highest degree. You will pardon me when I\r\nassure you, that everything which I have seen or heard since I first\r\nentered this house hath conspired to raise the greatest curiosity in\r\nme. Something very extraordinary must have determined you to this\r\ncourse of life, and I have reason to fear your own history is not\r\nwithout misfortunes.”\r\n\r\nHere the old gentleman again sighed, and remained silent for some\r\nminutes: at last, looking earnestly on Jones, he said, “I have read\r\nthat a good countenance is a letter of recommendation; if so, none\r\never can be more strongly recommended than yourself. If I did not feel\r\nsome yearnings towards you from another consideration, I must be the\r\nmost ungrateful monster upon earth; and I am really concerned it is no\r\notherwise in my power than by words to convince you of my gratitude.”\r\n\r\nJones, after a moment's hesitation, answered, “That it was in his\r\npower by words to gratify him extremely. I have confest a curiosity,”\r\n said he, “sir; need I say how much obliged I should be to you, if you\r\nwould condescend to gratify it? Will you suffer me therefore to beg,\r\nunless any consideration restrains you, that you would be pleased to\r\nacquaint me what motives have induced you thus to withdraw from the\r\nsociety of mankind, and to betake yourself to a course of life to\r\nwhich it sufficiently appears you were not born?”\r\n\r\n“I scarce think myself at liberty to refuse you anything after what\r\nhath happened,” replied the old man. “If you desire therefore to hear\r\nthe story of an unhappy man, I will relate it to you. Indeed you judge\r\nrightly, in thinking there is commonly something extraordinary in the\r\nfortunes of those who fly from society; for however it may seem a\r\nparadox, or even a contradiction, certain it is, that great\r\nphilanthropy chiefly inclines us to avoid and detest mankind; not on\r\naccount so much of their private and selfish vices, but for those of a\r\nrelative kind; such as envy, malice, treachery, cruelty, with every\r\nother species of malevolence. These are the vices which true\r\nphilanthropy abhors, and which rather than see and converse with, she\r\navoids society itself. However, without a compliment to you, you do\r\nnot appear to me one of those whom I should shun or detest; nay, I\r\nmust say, in what little hath dropt from you, there appears some\r\nparity in our fortunes: I hope, however, yours will conclude more\r\nsuccessfully.”\r\n\r\nHere some compliments passed between our heroe and his host, and then\r\nthe latter was going to begin his history, when Partridge interrupted\r\nhim. His apprehensions had now pretty well left him, but some effects\r\nof his terrors remained; he therefore reminded the gentleman of that\r\nexcellent brandy which he had mentioned. This was presently brought,\r\nand Partridge swallowed a large bumper.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman then, without any farther preface, began as you may read\r\nin the next chapter."

      "content": "In which the Man of the Hill begins to relate his history.\r\n\n“I was born in a village of Somersetshire, called Mark, in the year\r\n1657. My father was one of those whom they call gentlemen farmers. He\r\nhad a little estate of about £300 a year of his own, and rented\r\nanother estate of near the same value. He was prudent and industrious,\r\nand so good a husbandman, that he might have led a very easy and\r\ncomfortable life, had not an arrant vixen of a wife soured his\r\ndomestic quiet. But though this circumstance perhaps made him\r\nmiserable, it did not make him poor; for he confined her almost\r\nentirely at home, and rather chose to bear eternal upbraidings in his\r\nown house, than to injure his fortune by indulging her in the\r\nextravagancies she desired abroad.\r\n\r\n“By this Xanthippe” (so was the wife of Socrates called, said\r\nPartridge)--“by this Xanthippe he had two sons, of which I was the\r\nyounger. He designed to give us both good education; but my elder\r\nbrother, who, unhappily for him, was the favourite of my mother,\r\nutterly neglected his learning; insomuch that, after having been five\r\nor six years at school with little or no improvement, my father, being\r\ntold by his master that it would be to no purpose to keep him longer\r\nthere, at last complied with my mother in taking him home from the\r\nhands of that tyrant, as she called his master; though indeed he gave\r\nthe lad much less correction than his idleness deserved, but much\r\nmore, it seems, than the young gentleman liked, who constantly\r\ncomplained to his mother of his severe treatment, and she as\r\nconstantly gave him a hearing.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” cries Partridge, “I have seen such mothers; I have been\r\nabused myself by them, and very unjustly; such parents deserve\r\ncorrection as much as their children.”\r\n\r\nJones chid the pedagogue for his interruption, and then the stranger\r\nproceeded.\r\n\r\n“My brother now, at the age of fifteen, bade adieu to all learning,\r\nand to everything else but to his dog and gun; with which latter he\r\nbecame so expert, that, though perhaps you may think it incredible, he\r\ncould not only hit a standing mark with great certainty, but hath\r\nactually shot a crow as it was flying in the air. He was likewise\r\nexcellent at finding a hare sitting, and was soon reputed one of the\r\nbest sportsmen in the country; a reputation which both he and his\r\nmother enjoyed as much as if he had been thought the finest scholar.\r\n\r\n“The situation of my brother made me at first think my lot the harder,\r\nin being continued at school: but I soon changed my opinion; for as I\r\nadvanced pretty fast in learning, my labours became easy, and my\r\nexercise so delightful, that holidays were my most unpleasant time;\r\nfor my mother, who never loved me, now apprehending that I had the\r\ngreater share of my father's affection, and finding, or at least\r\nthinking, that I was more taken notice of by some gentlemen of\r\nlearning, and particularly by the parson of the parish, than my\r\nbrother, she now hated my sight, and made home so disagreeable to me,\r\nthat what is called by school-boys Black Monday, was to me the whitest\r\nin the whole year.\r\n\r\n“Having at length gone through the school at Taunton, I was thence\r\nremoved to Exeter College in Oxford, where I remained four years; at\r\nthe end of which an accident took me off entirely from my studies; and\r\nhence, I may truly date the rise of all which happened to me\r\nafterwards in life.\r\n\r\n“There was at the same college with myself one Sir George Gresham, a\r\nyoung fellow who was intitled to a very considerable fortune, which he\r\nwas not, by the will of his father, to come into full possession of\r\ntill he arrived at the age of twenty-five. However, the liberality of\r\nhis guardians gave him little cause to regret the abundant caution of\r\nhis father; for they allowed him five hundred pounds a year while he\r\nremained at the university, where he kept his horses and his whore,\r\nand lived as wicked and as profligate a life as he could have done had\r\nhe been never so entirely master of his fortune; for besides the five\r\nhundred a year which he received from his guardians, he found means to\r\nspend a thousand more. He was above the age of twenty-one, and had no\r\ndifficulty in gaining what credit he pleased.\r\n\r\n“This young fellow, among many other tolerable bad qualities, had one\r\nvery diabolical. He had a great delight in destroying and ruining the\r\nyouth of inferior fortune, by drawing them into expenses which they\r\ncould not afford so well as himself; and the better, and worthier, and\r\nsoberer any young man was, the greater pleasure and triumph had he in\r\nhis destruction. Thus acting the character which is recorded of the\r\ndevil, and going about seeking whom he might devour.\r\n\r\n“It was my misfortune to fall into an acquaintance and intimacy with\r\nthis gentleman. My reputation of diligence in my studies made me a\r\ndesirable object of his mischievous intention; and my own inclination\r\nmade it sufficiently easy for him to effect his purpose; for though I\r\nhad applied myself with much industry to books, in which I took great\r\ndelight, there were other pleasures in which I was capable of taking\r\nmuch greater; for I was high-mettled, had a violent flow of animal\r\nspirits, was a little ambitious, and extremely amorous.\r\n\r\n“I had not long contracted an intimacy with Sir George before I became\r\na partaker of all his pleasures; and when I was once entered on that\r\nscene, neither my inclination nor my spirit would suffer me to play an\r\nunder part. I was second to none of the company in any acts of\r\ndebauchery; nay, I soon distinguished myself so notably in all riots\r\nand disorders, that my name generally stood first in the roll of\r\ndelinquents; and instead of being lamented as the unfortunate pupil of\r\nSir George, I was now accused as the person who had misled and\r\ndebauched that hopeful young gentleman; for though he was the\r\nringleader and promoter of all the mischief, he was never so\r\nconsidered. I fell at last under the censure of the vice-chancellor,\r\nand very narrowly escaped expulsion.\r\n\r\n“You will easily believe, sir, that such a life as I am now describing\r\nmust be incompatible with my further progress in learning; and that in\r\nproportion as I addicted myself more and more to loose pleasure, I\r\nmust grow more and more remiss in application to my studies. This was\r\ntruly the consequence; but this was not all. My expenses now greatly\r\nexceeded not only my former income, but those additions which I\r\nextorted from my poor generous father, on pretences of sums being\r\nnecessary for preparing for my approaching degree of batchelor of\r\narts. These demands, however, grew at last so frequent and exorbitant,\r\nthat my father by slow degrees opened his ears to the accounts which\r\nhe received from many quarters of my present behaviour, and which my\r\nmother failed not to echo very faithfully and loudly; adding, `Ay,\r\nthis is the fine gentleman, the scholar who doth so much honour to his\r\nfamily, and is to be the making of it. I thought what all this\r\nlearning would come to. He is to be the ruin of us all, I find, after\r\nhis elder brother hath been denied necessaries for his sake, to\r\nperfect his education forsooth, for which he was to pay us such\r\ninterest: I thought what the interest would come to,' with much more\r\nof the same kind; but I have, I believe, satisfied you with this\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n“My father, therefore, began now to return remonstrances instead of\r\nmoney to my demands, which brought my affairs perhaps a little sooner\r\nto a crisis; but had he remitted me his whole income, you will imagine\r\nit could have sufficed a very short time to support one who kept pace\r\nwith the expenses of Sir George Gresham.\r\n\r\n“It is more than possible that the distress I was now in for money,\r\nand the impracticability of going on in this manner, might have\r\nrestored me at once to my senses and to my studies, had I opened my\r\neyes before I became involved in debts from which I saw no hopes of\r\never extricating myself. This was indeed the great art of Sir George,\r\nand by which he accomplished the ruin of many, whom he afterwards\r\nlaughed at as fools and coxcombs, for vying, as he called it, with a\r\nman of his fortune. To bring this about, he would now and then advance\r\na little money himself, in order to support the credit of the\r\nunfortunate youth with other people; till, by means of that very\r\ncredit, he was irretrievably undone.\r\n\r\n“My mind being by these means grown as desperate as my fortune, there\r\nwas scarce a wickedness which I did not meditate, in order for my\r\nrelief. Self-murder itself became the subject of my serious\r\ndeliberation; and I had certainly resolved on it, had not a more\r\nshameful, though perhaps less sinful, thought expelled it from my\r\nhead.”--Here he hesitated a moment, and then cried out, “I protest, so\r\nmany years have not washed away the shame of this act, and I shall\r\nblush while I relate it.” Jones desired him to pass over anything that\r\nmight give him pain in the relation; but Partridge eagerly cried out,\r\n“Oh, pray, sir, let us hear this; I had rather hear this than all the\r\nrest; as I hope to be saved, I will never mention a word of it.” Jones\r\nwas going to rebuke him, but the stranger prevented it by proceeding\r\nthus: “I had a chum, a very prudent, frugal young lad, who, though he\r\nhad no very large allowance, had by his parsimony heaped up upwards of\r\nforty guineas, which I knew he kept in his escritore. I took therefore\r\nan opportunity of purloining his key from his breeches-pocket, while\r\nhe was asleep, and thus made myself master of all his riches: after\r\nwhich I again conveyed his key into his pocket, and counterfeiting\r\nsleep--though I never once closed my eyes, lay in bed till after he\r\narose and went to prayers--an exercise to which I had long been\r\nunaccustomed.\r\n\r\n“Timorous thieves, by extreme caution, often subject themselves to\r\ndiscoveries, which those of a bolder kind escape. Thus it happened to\r\nme; for had I boldly broke open his escritore, I had, perhaps, escaped\r\neven his suspicion; but as it was plain that the person who robbed him\r\nhad possessed himself of his key, he had no doubt, when he first\r\nmissed his money, but that his chum was certainly the thief. Now as he\r\nwas of a fearful disposition, and much my inferior in strength, and I\r\nbelieve in courage, he did not dare to confront me with my guilt, for\r\nfear of worse bodily consequences which might happen to him. He\r\nrepaired therefore immediately to the vice-chancellor, and upon\r\nswearing to the robbery, and to the circumstances of it, very easily\r\nobtained a warrant against one who had now so bad a character through\r\nthe whole university.\r\n\r\n“Luckily for me, I lay out of the college the next evening; for that\r\nday I attended a young lady in a chaise to Witney, where we staid all\r\nnight, and in our return, the next morning, to Oxford, I met one of my\r\ncronies, who acquainted me with sufficient news concerning myself to\r\nmake me turn my horse another way.”\r\n\r\n“Pray, sir, did he mention anything of the warrant?” said Partridge.\r\nBut Jones begged the gentleman to proceed without regarding any\r\nimpertinent questions; which he did as follows:--\r\n\r\n“Having now abandoned all thoughts of returning to Oxford, the next\r\nthing which offered itself was a journey to London. I imparted this\r\nintention to my female companion, who at first remonstrated against\r\nit; but upon producing my wealth, she immediately consented. We then\r\nstruck across the country, into the great Cirencester road, and made\r\nsuch haste, that we spent the next evening, save one, in London.\r\n\r\n“When you consider the place where I now was, and the company with\r\nwhom I was, you will, I fancy, conceive that a very short time brought\r\nme to an end of that sum of which I had so iniquitously possessed\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\n“I was now reduced to a much higher degree of distress than before:\r\nthe necessaries of life began to be numbered among my wants; and what\r\nmade my case still the more grievous was, that my paramour, of whom I\r\nwas now grown immoderately fond, shared the same distresses with\r\nmyself. To see a woman you love in distress; to be unable to relieve\r\nher, and at the same time to reflect that you have brought her into\r\nthis situation, is perhaps a curse of which no imagination can\r\nrepresent the horrors to those who have not felt it.”--“I believe it\r\nfrom my soul,” cries Jones, “and I pity you from the bottom of my\r\nheart:” he then took two or three disorderly turns about the room, and\r\nat last begged pardon, and flung himself into his chair, crying, “I\r\nthank Heaven, I have escaped that!”\r\n\r\n“This circumstance,” continued the gentleman, “so severely aggravated\r\nthe horrors of my present situation, that they became absolutely\r\nintolerable. I could with less pain endure the raging in my own\r\nnatural unsatisfied appetites, even hunger or thirst, than I could\r\nsubmit to leave ungratified the most whimsical desires of a woman on\r\nwhom I so extravagantly doated, that, though I knew she had been the\r\nmistress of half my acquaintance, I firmly intended to marry her. But\r\nthe good creature was unwilling to consent to an action which the\r\nworld might think so much to my disadvantage. And as, possibly, she\r\ncompassionated the daily anxieties which she must have perceived me\r\nsuffer on her account, she resolved to put an end to my distress. She\r\nsoon, indeed, found means to relieve me from my troublesome and\r\nperplexed situation; for while I was distracted with various\r\ninventions to supply her with pleasures, she very kindly--betrayed me\r\nto one of her former lovers at Oxford, by whose care and diligence I\r\nwas immediately apprehended and committed to gaol.\r\n\r\n“Here I first began seriously to reflect on the miscarriages of my\r\nformer life; on the errors I had been guilty of; on the misfortunes\r\nwhich I had brought on myself; and on the grief which I must have\r\noccasioned to one of the best of fathers. When I added to all these\r\nthe perfidy of my mistress, such was the horror of my mind, that life,\r\ninstead of being longer desirable, grew the object of my abhorrence;\r\nand I could have gladly embraced death as my dearest friend, if it had\r\noffered itself to my choice unattended by shame.\r\n\r\n“The time of the assizes soon came, and I was removed by habeas corpus\r\nto Oxford, where I expected certain conviction and condemnation; but,\r\nto my great surprize, none appeared against me, and I was, at the end\r\nof the sessions, discharged for want of prosecution. In short, my chum\r\nhad left Oxford, and whether from indolence, or from what other motive\r\nI am ignorant, had declined concerning himself any farther in the\r\naffair.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” cries Partridge, “he did not care to have your blood upon\r\nhis hands; and he was in the right on't. If any person was to be\r\nhanged upon my evidence, I should never be able to lie alone\r\nafterwards, for fear of seeing his ghost.”\r\n\r\n“I shall shortly doubt, Partridge,” says Jones, “whether thou art more\r\nbrave or wise.”--“You may laugh at me, sir, if you please,” answered\r\nPartridge; “but if you will hear a very short story which I can tell,\r\nand which is most certainly true, perhaps you may change your opinion.\r\nIn the parish where I was born--” Here Jones would have silenced him;\r\nbut the stranger interceded that he might be permitted to tell his\r\nstory, and in the meantime promised to recollect the remainder of his\r\nown.\r\n\r\nPartridge then proceeded thus: “In the parish where I was born, there\r\nlived a farmer whose name was Bridle, and he had a son named Francis,\r\na good hopeful young fellow: I was at the grammar-school with him,\r\nwhere I remember he was got into Ovid's Epistles, and he could\r\nconstrue you three lines together sometimes without looking into a\r\ndictionary. Besides all this, he was a very good lad, never missed\r\nchurch o' Sundays, and was reckoned one of the best psalm-singers in\r\nthe whole parish. He would indeed now and then take a cup too much,\r\nand that was the only fault he had.”--“Well, but come to the ghost,”\r\n cries Jones. “Never fear, sir; I shall come to him soon enough,”\r\n answered Partridge. “You must know, then, that farmer Bridle lost a\r\nmare, a sorrel one, to the best of my remembrance; and so it fell out\r\nthat this young Francis shortly afterward being at a fair at Hindon,\r\nand as I think it was on--, I can't remember the day; and being as he\r\nwas, what should he happen to meet but a man upon his father's mare.\r\nFrank called out presently, Stop thief; and it being in the middle of\r\nthe fair, it was impossible, you know, for the man to make his escape.\r\nSo they apprehended him and carried him before the justice: I remember\r\nit was Justice Willoughby, of Noyle, a very worthy good gentleman; and\r\nhe committed him to prison, and bound Frank in a recognisance, I think\r\nthey call it--a hard word compounded of _re_ and _cognosco_; but it\r\ndiffers in its meaning from the use of the simple, as many other\r\ncompounds do. Well, at last down came my Lord Justice Page to hold the\r\nassizes; and so the fellow was had up, and Frank was had up for a\r\nwitness. To be sure, I shall never forget the face of the judge, when\r\nhe began to ask him what he had to say against the prisoner. He made\r\npoor Frank tremble and shake in his shoes. `Well you, fellow,' says my\r\nlord, `what have you to say? Don't stand humming and hawing, but speak\r\nout.' But, however, he soon turned altogether as civil to Frank, and\r\nbegan to thunder at the fellow; and when he asked him if he had\r\nanything to say for himself, the fellow said, he had found the horse.\r\n`Ay!' answered the judge, `thou art a lucky fellow: I have travelled\r\nthe circuit these forty years, and never found a horse in my life: but\r\nI'll tell thee what, friend, thou wast more lucky than thou didst know\r\nof; for thou didst not only find a horse, but a halter too, I promise\r\nthee.' To be sure, I shall never forget the word. Upon which everybody\r\nfell a laughing, as how could they help it? Nay, and twenty other\r\njests he made, which I can't remember now. There was something about\r\nhis skill in horse-flesh which made all the folks laugh. To be\r\ncertain, the judge must have been a very brave man, as well as a man\r\nof much learning. It is indeed charming sport to hear trials upon life\r\nand death. One thing I own I thought a little hard, that the\r\nprisoner's counsel was not suffered to speak for him, though he\r\ndesired only to be heard one very short word, but my lord would not\r\nhearken to him, though he suffered a counsellor to talk against him\r\nfor above half-an-hour. I thought it hard, I own, that there should be\r\nso many of them; my lord, and the court, and the jury, and the\r\ncounsellors, and the witnesses, all upon one poor man, and he too in\r\nchains. Well, the fellow was hanged, as to be sure it could be no\r\notherwise, and poor Frank could never be easy about it. He never was\r\nin the dark alone, but he fancied he saw the fellow's spirit.”--“Well,\r\nand is this thy story?” cries Jones. “No, no,” answered Partridge. “O\r\nLord have mercy upon me! I am just now coming to the matter; for one\r\nnight, coming from the alehouse, in a long, narrow, dark lane, there\r\nhe ran directly up against him; and the spirit was all in white, and\r\nfell upon Frank; and Frank, who was a sturdy lad, fell upon the spirit\r\nagain, and there they had a tussel together, and poor Frank was\r\ndreadfully beat: indeed he made a shift at last to crawl home; but\r\nwhat with the beating, and what with the fright, he lay ill above a\r\nfortnight; and all this is most certainly true, and the whole parish\r\nwill bear witness to it.”\r\n\r\nThe stranger smiled at this story, and Jones burst into a loud fit of\r\nlaughter; upon which Partridge cried, “Ay, you may laugh, sir; and so\r\ndid some others, particularly a squire, who is thought to be no better\r\nthan an atheist; who, forsooth, because there was a calf with a white\r\nface found dead in the same lane the next morning, would fain have it\r\nthat the battle was between Frank and that, as if a calf would set\r\nupon a man. Besides, Frank told me he knew it to be a spirit, and\r\ncould swear to him in any court in Christendom; and he had not drank\r\nabove a quart or two or such a matter of liquor, at the time. Lud have\r\nmercy upon us, and keep us all from dipping our hands in blood, I\r\nsay!”\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” said Jones to the stranger, “Mr Partridge hath finished\r\nhis story, and I hope will give you no future interruption, if you\r\nwill be so kind to proceed.” He then resumed his narration; but as he\r\nhath taken breath for a while, we think proper to give it to our\r\nreader, and shall therefore put an end to this chapter."

      "content": "In which the Man of the Hill continues his history.\r\n\n“I had now regained my liberty,” said the stranger; “but I had lost my\r\nreputation; for there is a wide difference between the case of a man\r\nwho is barely acquitted of a crime in a court of justice, and of him\r\nwho is acquitted in his own heart, and in the opinion of the people. I\r\nwas conscious of my guilt, and ashamed to look any one in the face; so\r\nresolved to leave Oxford the next morning, before the daylight\r\ndiscovered me to the eyes of any beholders.\r\n\r\n“When I had got clear of the city, it first entered into my head to\r\nreturn home to my father, and endeavour to obtain his forgiveness; but\r\nas I had no reason to doubt his knowledge of all which had past, and\r\nas I was well assured of his great aversion to all acts of dishonesty,\r\nI could entertain no hopes of being received by him, especially since\r\nI was too certain of all the good offices in the power of my mother;\r\nnay, had my father's pardon been as sure, as I conceived his\r\nresentment to be, I yet question whether I could have had the\r\nassurance to behold him, or whether I could, upon any terms, have\r\nsubmitted to live and converse with those who, I was convinced, knew\r\nme to have been guilty of so base an action.\r\n\r\n“I hastened therefore back to London, the best retirement of either\r\ngrief or shame, unless for persons of a very public character; for\r\nhere you have the advantage of solitude without its disadvantage,\r\nsince you may be alone and in company at the same time; and while you\r\nwalk or sit unobserved, noise, hurry, and a constant succession of\r\nobjects, entertain the mind, and prevent the spirits from preying on\r\nthemselves, or rather on grief or shame, which are the most\r\nunwholesome diet in the world; and on which (though there are many who\r\nnever taste either but in public) there are some who can feed very\r\nplentifully and very fatally when alone.\r\n\r\n“But as there is scarce any human good without its concomitant evil,\r\nso there are people who find an inconvenience in this unobserving\r\ntemper of mankind; I mean persons who have no money; for as you are\r\nnot put out of countenance, so neither are you cloathed or fed by\r\nthose who do not know you. And a man may be as easily starved in\r\nLeadenhall-market as in the deserts of Arabia.\r\n\r\n“It was at present my fortune to be destitute of that great evil, as\r\nit is apprehended to be by several writers, who I suppose were\r\noverburthened with it, namely, money.”--“With submission, sir,” said\r\nPartridge, “I do not remember any writers who have called it\r\n_malorum_; but _irritamenta malorum_. _Effodiuntur opes, irritamenta\r\nmalorum_”--“Well, sir,” continued the stranger, “whether it be an\r\nevil, or only the cause of evil, I was entirely void of it, and at the\r\nsame time of friends, and, as I thought, of acquaintance; when one\r\nevening, as I was passing through the Inner Temple, very hungry, and\r\nvery miserable, I heard a voice on a sudden hailing me with great\r\nfamiliarity by my Christian name; and upon turning about, I presently\r\nrecollected the person who so saluted me to have been my\r\nfellow-collegiate; one who had left the university above a year, and\r\nlong before any of my misfortunes had befallen me. This gentleman,\r\nwhose name was Watson, shook me heartily by the hand; and expressing\r\ngreat joy at meeting me, proposed our immediately drinking a bottle\r\ntogether. I first declined the proposal, and pretended business, but\r\nas he was very earnest and pressing, hunger at last overcame my pride,\r\nand I fairly confessed to him I had no money in my pocket; yet not\r\nwithout framing a lie for an excuse, and imputing it to my having\r\nchanged my breeches that morning. Mr Watson answered, `I thought,\r\nJack, you and I had been too old acquaintance for you to mention such\r\na matter.' He then took me by the arm, and was pulling me along; but I\r\ngave him very little trouble, for my own inclinations pulled me much\r\nstronger than he could do.\r\n\r\n“We then went into the Friars, which you know is the scene of all\r\nmirth and jollity. Here, when we arrived at the tavern, Mr Watson\r\napplied himself to the drawer only, without taking the least notice of\r\nthe cook; for he had no suspicion but that I had dined long since.\r\nHowever, as the case was really otherwise, I forged another falsehood,\r\nand told my companion I had been at the further end of the city on\r\nbusiness of consequence, and had snapt up a mutton-chop in haste; so\r\nthat I was again hungry, and wished he would add a beef-steak to his\r\nbottle.”--“Some people,” cries Partridge, “ought to have good\r\nmemories; or did you find just money enough in your breeches to pay\r\nfor the mutton-chop?”--“Your observation is right,” answered the\r\nstranger, “and I believe such blunders are inseparable from all\r\ndealing in untruth.--But to proceed--I began now to feel myself\r\nextremely happy. The meat and wine soon revived my spirits to a high\r\npitch, and I enjoyed much pleasure in the conversation of my old\r\nacquaintance, the rather as I thought him entirely ignorant of what\r\nhad happened at the university since his leaving it.\r\n\r\n“But he did not suffer me to remain long in this agreeable delusion;\r\nfor taking a bumper in one hand, and holding me by the other, `Here,\r\nmy boy,' cries he, `here's wishing you joy of your being so honourably\r\nacquitted of that affair laid to your charge.' I was thunderstruck\r\nwith confusion at those words, which Watson observing, proceeded thus:\r\n`Nay, never be ashamed, man; thou hast been acquitted, and no one now\r\ndares call thee guilty; but, prithee, do tell me, who am thy friend--I\r\nhope thou didst really rob him? for rat me if it was not a meritorious\r\naction to strip such a sneaking, pitiful rascal; and instead of the\r\ntwo hundred guineas, I wish you had taken as many thousand. Come,\r\ncome, my boy, don't be shy of confessing to me: you are not now\r\nbrought before one of the pimps. D--n me if I don't honour you for it;\r\nfor, as I hope for salvation, I would have made no manner of scruple\r\nof doing the same thing.'\r\n\r\n“This declaration a little relieved my abashment; and as wine had now\r\nsomewhat opened my heart, I very freely acknowledged the robbery, but\r\nacquainted him that he had been misinformed as to the sum taken, which\r\nwas little more than a fifth part of what he had mentioned.\r\n\r\n“`I am sorry for it with all my heart,' quoth he, `and I wish thee\r\nbetter success another time. Though, if you will take my advice, you\r\nshall have no occasion to run any such risque. Here,' said he, taking\r\nsome dice out of his pocket, `here's the stuff. Here are the\r\nimplements; here are the little doctors which cure the distempers of\r\nthe purse. Follow but my counsel, and I will show you a way to empty\r\nthe pocket of a queer cull without any danger of the nubbing cheat.'”\r\n\r\n“Nubbing cheat!” cries Partridge: “pray, sir, what is that?”\r\n\r\n“Why that, sir,” says the stranger, “is a cant phrase for the gallows;\r\nfor as gamesters differ little from highwaymen in their morals, so do\r\nthey very much resemble them in their language.\r\n\r\n“We had now each drank our bottle, when Mr Watson said, the board was\r\nsitting, and that he must attend, earnestly pressing me at the same\r\ntime to go with him and try my fortune. I answered he knew that was at\r\npresent out of my power, as I had informed him of the emptiness of my\r\npocket. To say the truth, I doubted not from his many strong\r\nexpressions of friendship, but that he would offer to lend me a small\r\nsum for that purpose, but he answered, `Never mind that, man; e'en\r\nboldly run a levant' [Partridge was going to inquire the meaning of\r\nthat word, but Jones stopped his mouth]: `but be circumspect as to the\r\nman. I will tip you the proper person, which may be necessary, as you\r\ndo not know the town, nor can distinguish a rum cull from a queer\r\none.”\r\n\r\n“The bill was now brought, when Watson paid his share, and was\r\ndeparting. I reminded him, not without blushing, of my having no\r\nmoney. He answered, `That signifies nothing; score it behind the door,\r\nor make a bold brush and take no notice.--Or--stay,' says he; `I will\r\ngo down-stairs first, and then do you take up my money, and score the\r\nwhole reckoning at the bar, and I will wait for you at the corner.' I\r\nexpressed some dislike at this, and hinted my expectations that he\r\nwould have deposited the whole; but he swore he had not another\r\nsixpence in his pocket.\r\n\r\n“He then went down, and I was prevailed on to take up the money and\r\nfollow him, which I did close enough to hear him tell the drawer the\r\nreckoning was upon the table. The drawer past by me up-stairs; but I\r\nmade such haste into the street, that I heard nothing of his\r\ndisappointment, nor did I mention a syllable at the bar, according to\r\nmy instructions.\r\n\r\n“We now went directly to the gaming-table, where Mr Watson, to my\r\nsurprize, pulled out a large sum of money and placed it before him, as\r\ndid many others; all of them, no doubt, considering their own heaps as\r\nso many decoy birds, which were to intice and draw over the heaps of\r\ntheir neighbours.\r\n\r\n“Here it would be tedious to relate all the freaks which Fortune, or\r\nrather the dice, played in this her temple. Mountains of gold were in\r\na few moments reduced to nothing at one part of the table, and rose as\r\nsuddenly in another. The rich grew in a moment poor, and the poor as\r\nsuddenly became rich; so that it seemed a philosopher could nowhere\r\nhave so well instructed his pupils in the contempt of riches, at least\r\nhe could nowhere have better inculcated the incertainty of their\r\nduration.\r\n\r\n“For my own part, after having considerably improved my small estate,\r\nI at last entirely demolished it. Mr Watson too, after much variety of\r\nluck, rose from the table in some heat, and declared he had lost a\r\ncool hundred, and would play no longer. Then coming up to me, he asked\r\nme to return with him to the tavern; but I positively refused, saying,\r\nI would not bring myself a second time into such a dilemma, and\r\nespecially as he had lost all his money and was now in my own\r\ncondition. `Pooh!' says he, `I have just borrowed a couple of guineas\r\nof a friend, and one of them is at your service.' He immediately put\r\none of them into my hand, and I no longer resisted his inclination.\r\n\r\n“I was at first a little shocked at returning to the same house whence\r\nwe had departed in so unhandsome a manner; but when the drawer, with\r\nvery civil address, told us, `he believed we had forgot to pay our\r\nreckoning,' I became perfectly easy, and very readily gave him a\r\nguinea, bid him pay himself, and acquiesced in the unjust charge which\r\nhad been laid on my memory.\r\n\r\n“Mr Watson now bespoke the most extravagant supper he could well think\r\nof; and though he had contented himself with simple claret before,\r\nnothing now but the most precious Burgundy would serve his purpose.\r\n\r\n“Our company was soon encreased by the addition of several gentlemen\r\nfrom the gaming-table; most of whom, as I afterwards found, came not\r\nto the tavern to drink, but in the way of business; for the true\r\ngamesters pretended to be ill, and refused their glass, while they\r\nplied heartily two young fellows, who were to be afterwards pillaged,\r\nas indeed they were without mercy. Of this plunder I had the good\r\nfortune to be a sharer, though I was not yet let into the secret.\r\n\r\n“There was one remarkable accident attended this tavern play; for the\r\nmoney by degrees totally disappeared; so that though at the beginning\r\nthe table was half covered with gold, yet before the play ended, which\r\nit did not till the next day, being Sunday, at noon, there was scarce\r\na single guinea to be seen on the table; and this was the stranger as\r\nevery person present, except myself, declared he had lost; and what\r\nwas become of the money, unless the devil himself carried it away, is\r\ndifficult to determine.”\r\n\r\n“Most certainly he did,” says Partridge, “for evil spirits can carry\r\naway anything without being seen, though there were never so many folk\r\nin the room; and I should not have been surprized if he had carried\r\naway all the company of a set of wicked wretches, who were at play in\r\nsermon time. And I could tell you a true story, if I would, where the\r\ndevil took a man out of bed from another man's wife, and carried him\r\naway through the keyhole of the door. I've seen the very house where\r\nit was done, and nobody hath lived in it these thirty years.”\r\n\r\nThough Jones was a little offended by the impertinence of Partridge,\r\nhe could not however avoid smiling at his simplicity. The stranger did\r\nthe same, and then proceeded with his story, as will be seen in the\r\nnext chapter."

      "title": "Chapter xiii.",
      "content": "In which the foregoing story is farther continued.\r\n\n“My fellow-collegiate had now entered me in a new scene of life. I\r\nsoon became acquainted with the whole fraternity of sharpers, and was\r\nlet into their secrets; I mean, into the knowledge of those gross\r\ncheats which are proper to impose upon the raw and unexperienced; for\r\nthere are some tricks of a finer kind, which are known only to a few\r\nof the gang, who are at the head of their profession; a degree of\r\nhonour beyond my expectation; for drink, to which I was immoderately\r\naddicted, and the natural warmth of my passions, prevented me from\r\narriving at any great success in an art which requires as much\r\ncoolness as the most austere school of philosophy.\r\n\r\n“Mr Watson, with whom I now lived in the closest amity, had unluckily\r\nthe former failing to a very great excess; so that instead of making a\r\nfortune by his profession, as some others did, he was alternately rich\r\nand poor, and was often obliged to surrender to his cooler friends,\r\nover a bottle which they never tasted, that plunder that he had taken\r\nfrom culls at the public table.\r\n\r\n“However, we both made a shift to pick up an uncomfortable livelihood;\r\nand for two years I continued of the calling; during which time I\r\ntasted all the varieties of fortune, sometimes flourishing in\r\naffluence, and at others being obliged to struggle with almost\r\nincredible difficulties. To-day wallowing in luxury, and to-morrow\r\nreduced to the coarsest and most homely fare. My fine clothes being\r\noften on my back in the evening, and at the pawn-shop the next\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n“One night, as I was returning pennyless from the gaming-table, I\r\nobserved a very great disturbance, and a large mob gathered together\r\nin the street. As I was in no danger from pickpockets, I ventured into\r\nthe croud, where upon enquiry I found that a man had been robbed and\r\nvery ill used by some ruffians. The wounded man appeared very bloody,\r\nand seemed scarce able to support himself on his legs. As I had not\r\ntherefore been deprived of my humanity by my present life and\r\nconversation, though they had left me very little of either honesty or\r\nshame, I immediately offered my assistance to the unhappy person, who\r\nthankfully accepted it, and, putting himself under my conduct, begged\r\nme to convey him to some tavern, where he might send for a surgeon,\r\nbeing, as he said, faint with loss of blood. He seemed indeed highly\r\npleased at finding one who appeared in the dress of a gentleman; for\r\nas to all the rest of the company present, their outside was such that\r\nhe could not wisely place any confidence in them.\r\n\r\n“I took the poor man by the arm, and led him to the tavern where we\r\nkept our rendezvous, as it happened to be the nearest at hand. A\r\nsurgeon happening luckily to be in the house, immediately attended,\r\nand applied himself to dressing his wounds, which I had the pleasure\r\nto hear were not likely to be mortal.\r\n\r\n“The surgeon having very expeditiously and dextrously finished his\r\nbusiness, began to enquire in what part of the town the wounded man\r\nlodged; who answered, `That he was come to town that very morning;\r\nthat his horse was at an inn in Piccadilly, and that he had no other\r\nlodging, and very little or no acquaintance in town.'\r\n\r\n“This surgeon, whose name I have forgot, though I remember it began\r\nwith an R, had the first character in his profession, and was\r\nserjeant-surgeon to the king. He had moreover many good qualities, and\r\nwas a very generous good-natured man, and ready to do any service to\r\nhis fellow-creatures. He offered his patient the use of his chariot to\r\ncarry him to his inn, and at the same time whispered in his ear, `That\r\nif he wanted any money, he would furnish him.'\r\n\r\n“The poor man was not now capable of returning thanks for this\r\ngenerous offer; for having had his eyes for some time stedfastly on\r\nme, he threw himself back in his chair, crying, `Oh, my son! my son!'\r\nand then fainted away.\r\n\r\n“Many of the people present imagined this accident had happened\r\nthrough his loss of blood; but I, who at the same time began to\r\nrecollect the features of my father, was now confirmed in my\r\nsuspicion, and satisfied that it was he himself who appeared before\r\nme. I presently ran to him, raised him in my arms, and kissed his cold\r\nlips with the utmost eagerness. Here I must draw a curtain over a\r\nscene which I cannot describe; for though I did not lose my being, as\r\nmy father for a while did, my senses were however so overpowered with\r\naffright and surprize, that I am a stranger to what passed during some\r\nminutes, and indeed till my father had again recovered from his swoon,\r\nand I found myself in his arms, both tenderly embracing each other,\r\nwhile the tears trickled a-pace down the cheeks of each of us.\r\n\r\n“Most of those present seemed affected by this scene, which we, who\r\nmight be considered as the actors in it, were desirous of removing\r\nfrom the eyes of all spectators as fast as we could; my father\r\ntherefore accepted the kind offer of the surgeon's chariot, and I\r\nattended him in it to his inn.\r\n\r\n“When we were alone together, he gently upbraided me with having\r\nneglected to write to him during so long a time, but entirely omitted\r\nthe mention of that crime which had occasioned it. He then informed me\r\nof my mother's death, and insisted on my returning home with him,\r\nsaying, `That he had long suffered the greatest anxiety on my account;\r\nthat he knew not whether he had most feared my death or wished it,\r\nsince he had so many more dreadful apprehensions for me. At last, he\r\nsaid, a neighbouring gentleman, who had just recovered a son from the\r\nsame place, informed him where I was; and that to reclaim me from this\r\ncourse of life was the sole cause of his journey to London.' He\r\nthanked Heaven he had succeeded so far as to find me out by means of\r\nan accident which had like to have proved fatal to him; and had the\r\npleasure to think he partly owed his preservation to my humanity, with\r\nwhich he profest himself to be more delighted than he should have been\r\nwith my filial piety, if I had known that the object of all my care\r\nwas my own father.\r\n\r\n“Vice had not so depraved my heart as to excite in it an insensibility\r\nof so much paternal affection, though so unworthily bestowed. I\r\npresently promised to obey his commands in my return home with him, as\r\nsoon as he was able to travel, which indeed he was in a very few days,\r\nby the assistance of that excellent surgeon who had undertaken his\r\ncure.\r\n\r\n“The day preceding my father's journey (before which time I scarce\r\never left him), I went to take my leave of some of my most intimate\r\nacquaintance, particularly of Mr Watson, who dissuaded me from burying\r\nmyself, as he called it, out of a simple compliance with the fond\r\ndesires of a foolish old fellow. Such sollicitations, however, had no\r\neffect, and I once more saw my own home. My father now greatly\r\nsollicited me to think of marriage; but my inclinations were utterly\r\naverse to any such thoughts. I had tasted of love already, and perhaps\r\nyou know the extravagant excesses of that most tender and most violent\r\npassion.”--Here the old gentleman paused, and looked earnestly at\r\nJones; whose countenance, within a minute's space, displayed the\r\nextremities of both red and white. Upon which the old man, without\r\nmaking any observations, renewed his narrative.\r\n\r\n“Being now provided with all the necessaries of life, I betook myself\r\nonce again to study, and that with a more inordinate application than\r\nI had ever done formerly. The books which now employed my time solely\r\nwere those, as well antient as modern, which treat of true philosophy,\r\na word which is by many thought to be the subject only of farce and\r\nridicule. I now read over the works of Aristotle and Plato, with the\r\nrest of those inestimable treasures which antient Greece had\r\nbequeathed to the world.\r\n\r\n“These authors, though they instructed me in no science by which men\r\nmay promise to themselves to acquire the least riches or worldly\r\npower, taught me, however, the art of despising the highest\r\nacquisitions of both. They elevate the mind, and steel and harden it\r\nagainst the capricious invasions of fortune. They not only instruct in\r\nthe knowledge of Wisdom, but confirm men in her habits, and\r\ndemonstrate plainly, that this must be our guide, if we propose ever\r\nto arrive at the greatest worldly happiness, or to defend ourselves,\r\nwith any tolerable security, against the misery which everywhere\r\nsurrounds and invests us.\r\n\r\n“To this I added another study, compared to which, all the philosophy\r\ntaught by the wisest heathens is little better than a dream, and is\r\nindeed as full of vanity as the silliest jester ever pleased to\r\nrepresent it. This is that Divine wisdom which is alone to be found in\r\nthe Holy Scriptures; for they impart to us the knowledge and assurance\r\nof things much more worthy our attention than all which this world can\r\noffer to our acceptance; of things which Heaven itself hath\r\ncondescended to reveal to us, and to the smallest knowledge of which\r\nthe highest human wit unassisted could never ascend. I began now to\r\nthink all the time I had spent with the best heathen writers was\r\nlittle more than labour lost: for, however pleasant and delightful\r\ntheir lessons may be, or however adequate to the right regulation of\r\nour conduct with respect to this world only; yet, when compared with\r\nthe glory revealed in Scripture, their highest documents will appear\r\nas trifling, and of as little consequence, as the rules by which\r\nchildren regulate their childish little games and pastime. True it is,\r\nthat philosophy makes us wiser, but Christianity makes us better men.\r\nPhilosophy elevates and steels the mind, Christianity softens and\r\nsweetens it. The former makes us the objects of human admiration, the\r\nlatter of Divine love. That insures us a temporal, but this an eternal\r\nhappiness.--But I am afraid I tire you with my rhapsody.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” cries Partridge; “Lud forbid we should be tired with\r\ngood things!”\r\n\r\n“I had spent,” continued the stranger, “about four years in the most\r\ndelightful manner to myself, totally given up to contemplation, and\r\nentirely unembarrassed with the affairs of the world, when I lost the\r\nbest of fathers, and one whom I so entirely loved, that my grief at\r\nhis loss exceeds all description. I now abandoned my books, and gave\r\nmyself up for a whole month to the effects of melancholy and despair.\r\nTime, however, the best physician of the mind, at length brought me\r\nrelief.”--“Ay, ay; _Tempus edax rerum_” said Partridge.--“I then,”\r\n continued the stranger, “betook myself again to my former studies,\r\nwhich I may say perfected my cure; for philosophy and religion may be\r\ncalled the exercises of the mind, and when this is disordered, they\r\nare as wholesome as exercise can be to a distempered body. They do\r\nindeed produce similar effects with exercise; for they strengthen and\r\nconfirm the mind, till man becomes, in the noble strain of Horace--\r\n\r\n _Fortis, et in seipso totus teres atque rotundus,\r\n Externi ne quid valeat per laeve morari;\r\n In quem manca ruit semper Fortuna._“[*]\r\n\r\n [*] Firm in himself, who on himself relies,\r\n Polish'd and round, who runs his proper course\r\n And breaks misfortunes with superior force.--MR FRANCIS.\r\n\r\nHere Jones smiled at some conceit which intruded itself into his\r\nimagination; but the stranger, I believe, perceived it not, and\r\nproceeded thus:--\r\n\r\n“My circumstances were now greatly altered by the death of that best\r\nof men; for my brother, who was now become master of the house,\r\ndiffered so widely from me in his inclinations, and our pursuits in\r\nlife had been so very various, that we were the worst of company to\r\neach other: but what made our living together still more disagreeable,\r\nwas the little harmony which could subsist between the few who\r\nresorted to me, and the numerous train of sportsmen who often attended\r\nmy brother from the field to the table; for such fellows, besides the\r\nnoise and nonsense with which they persecute the ears of sober men,\r\nendeavour always to attack them with affront and contempt. This was so\r\nmuch the case, that neither I myself, nor my friends, could ever sit\r\ndown to a meal with them without being treated with derision, because\r\nwe were unacquainted with the phrases of sportsmen. For men of true\r\nlearning, and almost universal knowledge, always compassionate the\r\nignorance of others; but fellows who excel in some little, low,\r\ncontemptible art, are always certain to despise those who are\r\nunacquainted with that art.\r\n\r\n“In short, we soon separated, and I went, by the advice of a\r\nphysician, to drink the Bath waters; for my violent affliction, added\r\nto a sedentary life, had thrown me into a kind of paralytic disorder,\r\nfor which those waters are accounted an almost _certain_ cure. The\r\nsecond day after my arrival, as I was walking by the river, the sun\r\nshone so intensely hot (though it was early in the year), that I\r\nretired to the shelter of some willows, and sat down by the river\r\nside. Here I had not been seated long before I heard a person on the\r\nother side of the willows sighing and bemoaning himself bitterly. On a\r\nsudden, having uttered a most impious oath, he cried, `I am resolved\r\nto bear it no longer,' and directly threw himself into the water. I\r\nimmediately started, and ran towards the place, calling at the same\r\ntime as loudly as I could for assistance. An angler happened luckily\r\nto be a-fishing a little below me, though some very high sedge had hid\r\nhim from my sight. He immediately came up, and both of us together,\r\nnot without some hazard of our lives, drew the body to the shore. At\r\nfirst we perceived no sign of life remaining; but having held the body\r\nup by the heels (for we soon had assistance enough), it discharged a\r\nvast quantity of water at the mouth, and at length began to discover\r\nsome symptoms of breathing, and a little afterwards to move both its\r\nhands and its legs.\r\n\r\n“An apothecary, who happened to be present among others, advised that\r\nthe body, which seemed now to have pretty well emptied itself of\r\nwater, and which began to have many convulsive motions, should be\r\ndirectly taken up, and carried into a warm bed. This was accordingly\r\nperformed, the apothecary and myself attending.\r\n\r\n“As we were going towards an inn, for we knew not the man's lodgings,\r\nluckily a woman met us, who, after some violent screaming, told us\r\nthat the gentleman lodged at her house.\r\n\r\n“When I had seen the man safely deposited there, I left him to the\r\ncare of the apothecary; who, I suppose, used all the right methods\r\nwith him, for the next morning I heard he had perfectly recovered his\r\nsenses.\r\n\r\n“I then went to visit him, intending to search out, as well as I\r\ncould, the cause of his having attempted so desperate an act, and to\r\nprevent, as far as I was able, his pursuing such wicked intentions for\r\nthe future. I was no sooner admitted into his chamber, than we both\r\ninstantly knew each other; for who should this person be but my good\r\nfriend Mr Watson! Here I will not trouble you with what past at our\r\nfirst interview; for I would avoid prolixity as much as\r\npossible.”--“Pray let us hear all,” cries Partridge; “I want mightily\r\nto know what brought him to Bath.”\r\n\r\n“You shall hear everything material,” answered the stranger; and then\r\nproceeded to relate what we shall proceed to write, after we have\r\ngiven a short breathing time to both ourselves and the reader."

      "content": "In which the Man of the Hill concludes his history.\r\n\n“Mr Watson,” continued the stranger, “very freely acquainted me, that\r\nthe unhappy situation of his circumstances, occasioned by a tide of\r\nill luck, had in a manner forced him to a resolution of destroying\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n“I now began to argue very seriously with him, in opposition to this\r\nheathenish, or indeed diabolical, principle of the lawfulness of\r\nself-murder; and said everything which occurred to me on the subject;\r\nbut, to my great concern, it seemed to have very little effect on him.\r\nHe seemed not at all to repent of what he had done, and gave me reason\r\nto fear he would soon make a second attempt of the like horrible kind.\r\n\r\n“When I had finished my discourse, instead of endeavouring to answer\r\nmy arguments, he looked me stedfastly in the face, and with a smile\r\nsaid, `You are strangely altered, my good friend, since I remember\r\nyou. I question whether any of our bishops could make a better\r\nargument against suicide than you have entertained me with; but unless\r\nyou can find somebody who will lend me a cool hundred, I must either\r\nhang, or drown, or starve; and, in my opinion, the last death is the\r\nmost terrible of the three.'\r\n\r\n“I answered him very gravely that I was indeed altered since I had\r\nseen him last. That I had found leisure to look into my follies and to\r\nrepent of them. I then advised him to pursue the same steps; and at\r\nlast concluded with an assurance that I myself would lend him a\r\nhundred pound, if it would be of any service to his affairs, and he\r\nwould not put it into the power of a die to deprive him of it.\r\n\r\n“Mr Watson, who seemed almost composed in slumber by the former part\r\nof my discourse, was roused by the latter. He seized my hand eagerly,\r\ngave me a thousand thanks, and declared I was a friend indeed; adding\r\nthat he hoped I had a better opinion of him than to imagine he had\r\nprofited so little by experience, as to put any confidence in those\r\ndamned dice which had so often deceived him. `No, no,' cries he; `let\r\nme but once handsomely be set up again, and if ever Fortune makes a\r\nbroken merchant of me afterwards, I will forgive her.'\r\n\r\n“I very well understood the language of setting up, and broken\r\nmerchant. I therefore said to him, with a very grave face, Mr Watson,\r\nyou must endeavour to find out some business or employment, by which\r\nyou may procure yourself a livelihood; and I promise you, could I see\r\nany probability of being repaid hereafter, I would advance a much\r\nlarger sum than what you have mentioned, to equip you in any fair and\r\nhonourable calling; but as to gaming, besides the baseness and\r\nwickedness of making it a profession, you are really, to my own\r\nknowledge, unfit for it, and it will end in your certain ruin.\r\n\r\n“`Why now, that's strange,' answered he; `neither you, nor any of my\r\nfriends, would ever allow me to know anything of the matter, and yet I\r\nbelieve I _am_ as good a hand at every game as any of you all; and I\r\nheartily wish I was to play with you only for your whole fortune: I\r\nshould desire no better sport, and I would let you name your game into\r\nthe bargain: but come, my dear boy, have you the hundred in your\r\npocket?”\r\n\r\n“I answered I had only a bill for £50, which I delivered him, and\r\npromised to bring him the rest next morning; and after giving him a\r\nlittle more advice, took my leave.\r\n\r\n“I was indeed better than my word; for I returned to him that very\r\nafternoon. When I entered the room, I found him sitting up in his bed\r\nat cards with a notorious gamester. This sight, you will imagine,\r\nshocked me not a little; to which I may add the mortification of\r\nseeing my bill delivered by him to his antagonist, and thirty guineas\r\nonly given in exchange for it.\r\n\r\n“The other gamester presently quitted the room, and then Watson\r\ndeclared he was ashamed to see me; `but,' says he, `I find luck runs\r\nso damnably against me, that I will resolve to leave off play for\r\never. I have thought of the kind proposal you made me ever since, and\r\nI promise you there shall be no fault in me, if I do not put it in\r\nexecution.'\r\n\r\n“Though I had no great faith in his promises, I produced him the\r\nremainder of the hundred in consequence of my own; for which he gave\r\nme a note, which was all I ever expected to see in return for my\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n“We were prevented from any further discourse at present by the\r\narrival of the apothecary; who, with much joy in his countenance, and\r\nwithout even asking his patient how he did, proclaimed there was great\r\nnews arrived in a letter to himself, which he said would shortly be\r\npublic, `That the Duke of Monmouth was landed in the west with a vast\r\narmy of Dutch; and that another vast fleet hovered over the coast of\r\nNorfolk, and was to make a descent there, in order to favour the\r\nduke's enterprize with a diversion on that side.'\r\n\r\n“This apothecary was one of the greatest politicians of his time. He\r\nwas more delighted with the most paultry packet, than with the best\r\npatient, and the highest joy he was capable of, he received from\r\nhaving a piece of news in his possession an hour or two sooner than\r\nany other person in the town. His advices, however, were seldom\r\nauthentic; for he would swallow almost anything as a truth--a humour\r\nwhich many made use of to impose upon him.\r\n\r\n“Thus it happened with what he at present communicated; for it was\r\nknown within a short time afterwards that the duke was really landed,\r\nbut that his army consisted only of a few attendants; and as to the\r\ndiversion in Norfolk, it was entirely false.\r\n\r\n“The apothecary staid no longer in the room than while he acquainted\r\nus with his news; and then, without saying a syllable to his patient\r\non any other subject, departed to spread his advices all over the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\n“Events of this nature in the public are generally apt to eclipse all\r\nprivate concerns. Our discourse therefore now became entirely\r\npolitical.[*] For my own part, I had been for some time very seriously\r\naffected with the danger to which the Protestant religion was so\r\nvisibly exposed under a Popish prince, and thought the apprehension of\r\nit alone sufficient to justify that insurrection; for no real security\r\ncan ever be found against the persecuting spirit of Popery, when armed\r\nwith power, except the depriving it of that power, as woeful\r\nexperience presently showed. You know how King James behaved after\r\ngetting the better of this attempt; how little he valued either his\r\nroyal word, or coronation oath, or the liberties and rights of his\r\npeople. But all had not the sense to foresee this at first; and\r\ntherefore the Duke of Monmouth was weakly supported; yet all could\r\nfeel when the evil came upon them; and therefore all united, at last,\r\nto drive out that king, against whose exclusion a great party among us\r\nhad so warmly contended during the reign of his brother, and for whom\r\nthey now fought with such zeal and affection.”\r\n\r\n“What you say,” interrupted Jones, “is very true; and it has often\r\nstruck me, as the most wonderful thing I ever read of in history, that\r\nso soon after this convincing experience which brought our whole\r\nnation to join so unanimously in expelling King James, for the\r\npreservation of our religion and liberties, there should be a party\r\namong us mad enough to desire the placing his family again on the\r\nthrone.” “You are not in earnest!” answered the old man; “there can be\r\nno such party. As bad an opinion as I have of mankind, I cannot\r\nbelieve them infatuated to such a degree. There may be some hot-headed\r\nPapists led by their priests to engage in this desperate cause, and\r\nthink it a holy war; but that Protestants, that are members of the\r\nChurch of England, should be such apostates, such _felos de se_, I\r\ncannot believe it; no, no, young man, unacquainted as I am with what\r\nhas past in the world for these last thirty years, I cannot be so\r\nimposed upon as to credit so foolish a tale; but I see you have a mind\r\nto sport with my ignorance.”--“Can it be possible,” replied Jones,\r\n“that you have lived so much out of the world as not to know that\r\nduring that time there have been two rebellions in favour of the son\r\nof King James, one of which is now actually raging in the very heart\r\nof the kingdom.” At these words the old gentleman started up, and in a\r\nmost solemn tone of voice, conjured Jones by his Maker to tell him if\r\nwhat he said was really true; which the other as solemnly affirming,\r\nhe walked several turns about the room in a profound silence, then\r\ncried, then laughed, and at last fell down on his knees, and blessed\r\nGod, in a loud thanksgiving prayer, for having delivered him from all\r\nsociety with human nature, which could be capable of such monstrous\r\nextravagances. After which, being reminded by Jones that he had broke\r\noff his story, he resumed it again in this manner:--\r\n\r\n“As mankind, in the days I was speaking of, was not yet arrived at\r\nthat pitch of madness which I find they are capable of now, and which,\r\nto be sure, I have only escaped by living alone, and at a distance\r\nfrom the contagion, there was a considerable rising in favour of\r\nMonmouth; and my principles strongly inclining me to take the same\r\npart, I determined to join him; and Mr Watson, from different motives\r\nconcurring in the same resolution (for the spirit of a gamester will\r\ncarry a man as far upon such an occasion as the spirit of patriotism),\r\nwe soon provided ourselves with all necessaries, and went to the duke\r\nat Bridgewater.\r\n\r\n“The unfortunate event of this enterprize, you are, I conclude, as\r\nwell acquainted with as myself. I escaped, together with Mr Watson,\r\nfrom the battle at Sedgemore, in which action I received a slight\r\nwound. We rode near forty miles together on the Exeter road, and then\r\nabandoning our horses, scrambled as well as we could through the\r\nfields and bye-roads, till we arrived at a little wild hut on a\r\ncommon, where a poor old woman took all the care of us she could, and\r\ndressed my wound with salve, which quickly healed it.”\r\n\r\n“Pray, sir, where was the wound?” says Partridge. The stranger\r\nsatisfied him it was in his arm, and then continued his narrative.\r\n“Here, sir,” said he, “Mr Watson left me the next morning, in order,\r\nas he pretended, to get us some provision from the town of Collumpton;\r\nbut--can I relate it, or can you believe it?--this Mr Watson, this\r\nfriend, this base, barbarous, treacherous villain, betrayed me to a\r\nparty of horse belonging to King James, and at his return delivered me\r\ninto their hands.\r\n\r\n“The soldiers, being six in number, had now seized me, and were\r\nconducting me to Taunton gaol; but neither my present situation, nor\r\nthe apprehensions of what might happen to me, were half so irksome to\r\nmy mind as the company of my false friend, who, having surrendered\r\nhimself, was likewise considered as a prisoner, though he was better\r\ntreated, as being to make his peace at my expense. He at first\r\nendeavoured to excuse his treachery; but when he received nothing but\r\nscorn and upbraiding from me, he soon changed his note, abused me as\r\nthe most atrocious and malicious rebel, and laid all his own guilt to\r\nmy charge, who, as he declared, had solicited, and even threatened\r\nhim, to make him take up arms against his gracious as well as lawful\r\nsovereign.\r\n\r\n“This false evidence (for in reality he had been much the forwarder of\r\nthe two) stung me to the quick, and raised an indignation scarce\r\nconceivable by those who have not felt it. However, fortune at length\r\ntook pity on me; for as we were got a little beyond Wellington, in a\r\nnarrow lane, my guards received a false alarm, that near fifty of the\r\nenemy were at hand; upon which they shifted for themselves, and left\r\nme and my betrayer to do the same. That villain immediately ran from\r\nme, and I am glad he did, or I should have certainly endeavoured,\r\nthough I had no arms, to have executed vengeance on his baseness.\r\n\r\n“I was now once more at liberty; and immediately withdrawing from the\r\nhighway into the fields, I travelled on, scarce knowing which way I\r\nwent, and making it my chief care to avoid all public roads and all\r\ntowns--nay, even the most homely houses; for I imagined every human\r\ncreature whom I saw desirous of betraying me.\r\n\r\n“At last, after rambling several days about the country, during which\r\nthe fields afforded me the same bed and the same food which nature\r\nbestows on our savage brothers of the creation, I at length arrived at\r\nthis place, where the solitude and wildness of the country invited me\r\nto fix my abode. The first person with whom I took up my habitation\r\nwas the mother of this old woman, with whom I remained concealed till\r\nthe news of the glorious revolution put an end to all my apprehensions\r\nof danger, and gave me an opportunity of once more visiting my own\r\nhome, and of enquiring a little into my affairs, which I soon settled\r\nas agreeably to my brother as to myself; having resigned everything to\r\nhim, for which he paid me the sum of a thousand pounds, and settled on\r\nme an annuity for life.\r\n\r\n“His behaviour in this last instance, as in all others, was selfish\r\nand ungenerous. I could not look on him as my friend, nor indeed did\r\nhe desire that I should; so I presently took my leave of him, as well\r\nas of my other acquaintance; and from that day to this, my history is\r\nlittle better than a blank.”\r\n\r\n“And is it possible, sir,” said Jones, “that you can have resided here\r\nfrom that day to this?”--“O no, sir,” answered the gentleman; “I have\r\nbeen a great traveller, and there are few parts of Europe with which I\r\nam not acquainted.” “I have not, sir,” cried Jones, “the assurance to\r\nask it of you now; indeed it would be cruel, after so much breath as\r\nyou have already spent: but you will give me leave to wish for some\r\nfurther opportunity of hearing the excellent observations which a man\r\nof your sense and knowledge of the world must have made in so long a\r\ncourse of travels.”--“Indeed, young gentleman,” answered the stranger,\r\n“I will endeavour to satisfy your curiosity on this head likewise, as\r\nfar as I am able.” Jones attempted fresh apologies, but was prevented;\r\nand while he and Partridge sat with greedy and impatient ears, the\r\nstranger proceeded as in the next chapter.\r\n\n [*] _The rest of this paragraph and the two following paragraphs\r\n in the first edition were as follows_:\r\n\r\n “For my own part, I had been for some time very seriously affected\r\n with the danger to which the Protestant religion was so visibly\r\n exposed, that nothing but the immediate interposition of Providence\r\n seemed capable of preserving it; for King James had indeed declared\r\n war against the Protestant cause. He had brought known papists into\r\n the army and attempted to bring them into the Church and into the\r\n University. Popish priests swarmed through the nation, appeared\r\n publicly in their habits, and boasted that they should shortly walk\r\n in procession through the streets. Our own clergy were forbid to\r\n preach against popery, and bishops were ordered to supend those who\r\n did; and to do the business at once an illegal ecclesiastical\r\n commission was erected, little inferior to an inquisition, of which,\r\n probably, it was intended to be the ringleader. Thus, as our duty to\r\n the king can never be called more than our second duty, he had\r\n discharged us from this by making it incompatible with our\r\n preserving the first, which is surely to heaven. Besides this, he\r\n had dissolved his subjects from their allegiance by breaking his\r\n Coronation Oath, to which their allegiance is annexed; for he had\r\n imprisoned bishops because they would not give up their religion,\r\n and turned out judges because they would not absolutely surrender\r\n the law into his hands; nay, he seized this himself, and when he\r\n claimed a dispensing power, he declared himself, in fact, as\r\n absolute as any tyrant ever was or can be. I have recapitulated\r\n these matters in full lest some of them should have been omitted in\r\n history; and I think nothing less than such provocations as I have\r\n here mentioned, nothing less than certain and imminent danger to\r\n their religion and liberties, can justify or even mitigate the\r\n dreadful sin of rebellion in any people.”\r\n\r\n “I promise you, sir,” says Jones, “all these facts, and more, I have\r\n read in history, but I will tell you a fact which is not yet\r\n recorded and of which I suppose you are ignorant. There is actually\r\n now a rebellion on foot in this kingdom in favour of the son of that\r\n very King James, a professed papist, more bigoted, if possible, than\r\n his father, and this carried on by Protestants against a king who\r\n hath never in one single instance made the least invasion on our\r\n liberties.”\r\n\r\n “Prodigious indeed!” answered the stranger. “You tell me what would\r\n be incredible of a nation which did not deserve the character that\r\n Virgil gives of a woman, _varium et mutabile semper_. Surely this is\r\n to be unworthy of the care which Providence seems to have taken of\r\n us in the preservation of our religion against the powerful designs\r\n and constant machinations of Popery, a preservation so strange and\r\n unaccountable that I almost think we may appeal to it as to a\r\n miracle for the proof of its holiness. Prodigious indeed! A\r\n Protestant rebellion in favour of a popish prince! The folly of\r\n mankind is as wonderful as their knavery--But to conclude my story:\r\n I resolved to take arms in defence of my country, of my religion,\r\n and my liberty, and Mr. Watson joined in the same resolution. We\r\n soon provided ourselves with an necessaries and joined the Duke at\r\n Bridgewater.”\r\n\r\n “The unfortunate event of this enterprise you are perhaps better\r\n acquainted with than myself. I escaped together with Mr. Watson from\r\n the battle at Sedgemore,..."

      "content": "A brief history of Europe; and a curious discourse between Mr Jones\r\nand the Man of the Hill.\r\n\n“In Italy the landlords are very silent. In France they are more\r\ntalkative, but yet civil. In Germany and Holland they are generally\r\nvery impertinent. And as for their honesty, I believe it is pretty\r\nequal in all those countries. The _laquais à louange_ are sure to lose\r\nno opportunity of cheating you; and as for the postilions, I think\r\nthey are pretty much alike all the world over. These, sir, are the\r\nobservations on men which I made in my travels; for these were the\r\nonly men I ever conversed with. My design, when I went abroad, was to\r\ndivert myself by seeing the wondrous variety of prospects, beasts,\r\nbirds, fishes, insects, and vegetables, with which God has been\r\npleased to enrich the several parts of this globe; a variety which, as\r\nit must give great pleasure to a contemplative beholder, so doth it\r\nadmirably display the power, and wisdom, and goodness of the Creator.\r\nIndeed, to say the truth, there is but one work in his whole creation\r\nthat doth him any dishonour, and with that I have long since avoided\r\nholding any conversation.”\r\n\r\n“You will pardon me,” cries Jones; “but I have always imagined that\r\nthere is in this very work you mention as great variety as in all the\r\nrest; for, besides the difference of inclination, customs and climates\r\nhave, I am told, introduced the utmost diversity into human nature.”\r\n\r\n“Very little indeed,” answered the other: “those who travel in order\r\nto acquaint themselves with the different manners of men might spare\r\nthemselves much pains by going to a carnival at Venice; for there they\r\nwill see at once all which they can discover in the several courts of\r\nEurope. The same hypocrisy, the same fraud; in short, the same follies\r\nand vices dressed in different habits. In Spain, these are equipped\r\nwith much gravity; and in Italy, with vast splendor. In France, a\r\nknave is dressed like a fop; and in the northern countries, like a\r\nsloven. But human nature is everywhere the same, everywhere the object\r\nof detestation and scorn.\r\n\r\n“As for my own part, I past through all these nations as you perhaps\r\nmay have done through a croud at a shew-jostling to get by them,\r\nholding my nose with one hand, and defending my pockets with the\r\nother, without speaking a word to any of them, while I was pressing on\r\nto see what I wanted to see; which, however entertaining it might be\r\nin itself, scarce made me amends for the trouble the company gave me.”\r\n\r\n“Did not you find some of the nations among which you travelled less\r\ntroublesome to you than others?” said Jones. “O yes,” replied the old\r\nman: “the Turks were much more tolerable to me than the Christians;\r\nfor they are men of profound taciturnity, and never disturb a stranger\r\nwith questions. Now and then indeed they bestow a short curse upon\r\nhim, or spit in his face as he walks the streets, but then they have\r\ndone with him; and a man may live an age in their country without\r\nhearing a dozen words from them. But of all the people I ever saw,\r\nheaven defend me from the French! With their damned prate and\r\ncivilities, and doing the honour of their nation to strangers (as they\r\nare pleased to call it), but indeed setting forth their own vanity;\r\nthey are so troublesome, that I had infinitely rather pass my life\r\nwith the Hottentots than set my foot in Paris again. They are a nasty\r\npeople, but their nastiness is mostly without; whereas, in France, and\r\nsome other nations that I won't name, it is all within, and makes them\r\nstink much more to my reason than that of Hottentots does to my nose.\r\n\r\n“Thus, sir, I have ended the history of my life; for as to all that\r\nseries of years during which I have lived retired here, it affords no\r\nvariety to entertain you, and may be almost considered as one\r\nday.[*] The retirement has been so compleat, that I could hardly have\r\nenjoyed a more absolute solitude in the deserts of the Thebais than\r\nhere in the midst of this populous kingdom. As I have no estate, I am\r\nplagued with no tenants or stewards: my annuity is paid me pretty\r\nregularly, as indeed it ought to be; for it is much less than what I\r\nmight have expected in return for what I gave up. Visits I admit none;\r\nand the old woman who keeps my house knows that her place entirely\r\ndepends upon her saving me all the trouble of buying the things that I\r\nwant, keeping off all sollicitation or business from me, and holding\r\nher tongue whenever I am within hearing. As my walks are all by night,\r\nI am pretty secure in this wild unfrequented place from meeting any\r\ncompany. Some few persons I have met by chance, and sent them home\r\nheartily frighted, as from the oddness of my dress and figure they\r\ntook me for a ghost or a hobgoblin. But what has happened to-night\r\nshows that even here I cannot be safe from the villany of men; for\r\nwithout your assistance I had not only been robbed, but very probably\r\nmurdered.”\r\n\r\n [*] the rest of this paragraph is omitted in the third edition\r\n\r\nJones thanked the stranger for the trouble he had taken in relating\r\nhis story, and then expressed some wonder how he could possibly endure\r\na life of such solitude; “in which,” says he, “you may well complain\r\nof the want of variety. Indeed I am astonished how you have filled up,\r\nor rather killed, so much of your time.”\r\n\r\n“I am not at all surprized,” answered the other, “that to one whose\r\naffections and thoughts are fixed on the world my hours should appear\r\nto have wanted employment in this place: but there is one single act,\r\nfor which the whole life of man is infinitely too short: what time can\r\nsuffice for the contemplation and worship of that glorious, immortal,\r\nand eternal Being, among the works of whose stupendous creation not\r\nonly this globe, but even those numberless luminaries which we may\r\nhere behold spangling all the sky, though they should many of them be\r\nsuns lighting different systems of worlds, may possibly appear but as\r\na few atoms opposed to the whole earth which we inhabit? Can a man who\r\nby divine meditations is admitted as it were into the conversation of\r\nthis ineffable, incomprehensible Majesty, think days, or years, or\r\nages, too long for the continuance of so ravishing an honour? Shall\r\nthe trifling amusements, the palling pleasures, the silly business of\r\nthe world, roll away our hours too swiftly from us; and shall the pace\r\nof time seem sluggish to a mind exercised in studies so high, so\r\nimportant, and so glorious? As no time is sufficient, so no place is\r\nimproper, for this great concern. On what object can we cast our eyes\r\nwhich may not inspire us with ideas of his power, of his wisdom, and\r\nof his goodness? It is not necessary that the rising sun should dart\r\nhis fiery glories over the eastern horizon; nor that the boisterous\r\nwinds should rush from their caverns, and shake the lofty forest; nor\r\nthat the opening clouds should pour their deluges on the plains: it is\r\nnot necessary, I say, that any of these should proclaim his majesty:\r\nthere is not an insect, not a vegetable, of so low an order in the\r\ncreation as not to be honoured with bearing marks of the attributes of\r\nits great Creator; marks not only of his power, but of his wisdom and\r\ngoodness. Man alone, the king of this globe, the last and greatest\r\nwork of the Supreme Being, below the sun; man alone hath basely\r\ndishonoured his own nature; and by dishonesty, cruelty, ingratitude,\r\nand treachery, hath called his Maker's goodness in question, by\r\npuzzling us to account how a benevolent being should form so foolish\r\nand so vile an animal. Yet this is the being from whose conversation\r\nyou think, I suppose, that I have been unfortunately restrained, and\r\nwithout whose blessed society, life, in your opinion, must be tedious\r\nand insipid.”\r\n\r\n“In the former part of what you said,” replied Jones, “I most heartily\r\nand readily concur; but I believe, as well as hope, that the\r\nabhorrence which you express for mankind in the conclusion, is much\r\ntoo general. Indeed, you here fall into an error, which in my little\r\nexperience I have observed to be a very common one, by taking the\r\ncharacter of mankind from the worst and basest among them; whereas,\r\nindeed, as an excellent writer observes, nothing should be esteemed as\r\ncharacteristical of a species, but what is to be found among the best\r\nand most perfect individuals of that species. This error, I believe,\r\nis generally committed by those who from want of proper caution in the\r\nchoice of their friends and acquaintance, have suffered injuries from\r\nbad and worthless men; two or three instances of which are very\r\nunjustly charged on all human nature.”\r\n\r\n“I think I had experience enough of it,” answered the other: “my first\r\nmistress and my first friend betrayed me in the basest manner, and in\r\nmatters which threatened to be of the worst of consequences--even to\r\nbring me to a shameful death.”\r\n\r\n“But you will pardon me,” cries Jones, “if I desire you to reflect who\r\nthat mistress and who that friend were. What better, my good sir,\r\ncould be expected in love derived from the stews, or in friendship\r\nfirst produced and nourished at the gaming-table? To take the\r\ncharacters of women from the former instance, or of men from the\r\nlatter, would be as unjust as to assert that air is a nauseous and\r\nunwholesome element, because we find it so in a jakes. I have lived\r\nbut a short time in the world, and yet have known men worthy of the\r\nhighest friendship, and women of the highest love.”\r\n\r\n“Alas! young man,” answered the stranger, “you have lived, you\r\nconfess, but a very short time in the world: I was somewhat older than\r\nyou when I was of the same opinion.”\r\n\r\n“You might have remained so still,” replies Jones, “if you had not\r\nbeen unfortunate, I will venture to say incautious, in the placing\r\nyour affections. If there was, indeed, much more wickedness in the\r\nworld than there is, it would not prove such general assertions\r\nagainst human nature, since much of this arrives by mere accident, and\r\nmany a man who commits evil is not totally bad and corrupt in his\r\nheart. In truth, none seem to have any title to assert human nature to\r\nbe necessarily and universally evil, but those whose own minds afford\r\nthem one instance of this natural depravity; which is not, I am\r\nconvinced, your case.”\r\n\r\n“And such,” said the stranger, “will be always the most backward to\r\nassert any such thing. Knaves will no more endeavour to persuade us of\r\nthe baseness of mankind, than a highwayman will inform you that there\r\nare thieves on the road. This would, indeed, be a method to put you on\r\nyour guard, and to defeat their own purposes. For which reason, though\r\nknaves, as I remember, are very apt to abuse particular persons, yet\r\nthey never cast any reflection on human nature in general.” The old\r\ngentleman spoke this so warmly, that as Jones despaired of making a\r\nconvert, and was unwilling to offend, he returned no answer.\r\n\r\nThe day now began to send forth its first streams of light, when Jones\r\nmade an apology to the stranger for having staid so long, and perhaps\r\ndetained him from his rest. The stranger answered, “He never wanted\r\nrest less than at present; for that day and night were indifferent\r\nseasons to him; and that he commonly made use of the former for the\r\ntime of his repose and of the latter for his walks and lucubrations.\r\nHowever,” said he, “it is now a most lovely morning, and if you can\r\nbear any longer to be without your own rest or food, I will gladly\r\nentertain you with the sight of some very fine prospects which I\r\nbelieve you have not yet seen.”\r\n\r\nJones very readily embraced this offer, and they immediately set\r\nforward together from the cottage. As for Partridge, he had fallen\r\ninto a profound repose just as the stranger had finished his story;\r\nfor his curiosity was satisfied, and the subsequent discourse was not\r\nforcible enough in its operation to conjure down the charms of sleep.\r\nJones therefore left him to enjoy his nap; and as the reader may\r\nperhaps be at this season glad of the same favour, we will here put an\r\nend to the eighth book of our history.\r\n\nBOOK IX.\r\n\r\nCONTAINING TWELVE HOURS."

      "title": "Chapter i.",
      "content": "Of those who lawfully may, and of those who may not, write such\r\nhistories as this.\r\n\nAmong other good uses for which I have thought proper to institute\r\nthese several introductory chapters, I have considered them as a kind\r\nof mark or stamp, which may hereafter enable a very indifferent reader\r\nto distinguish what is true and genuine in this historic kind of\r\nwriting, from what is false and counterfeit. Indeed, it seems likely\r\nthat some such mark may shortly become necessary, since the favourable\r\nreception which two or three authors have lately procured for their\r\nworks of this nature from the public, will probably serve as an\r\nencouragement to many others to undertake the like. Thus a swarm of\r\nfoolish novels and monstrous romances will be produced, either to the\r\ngreat impoverishing of booksellers, or to the great loss of time and\r\ndepravation of morals in the reader; nay, often to the spreading of\r\nscandal and calumny, and to the prejudice of the characters of many\r\nworthy and honest people.\r\n\r\nI question not but the ingenious author of the Spectator was\r\nprincipally induced to prefix Greek and Latin mottos to every paper,\r\nfrom the same consideration of guarding against the pursuit of those\r\nscribblers, who having no talents of a writer but what is taught by\r\nthe writing-master, are yet nowise afraid nor ashamed to assume the\r\nsame titles with the greatest genius, than their good brother in the\r\nfable was of braying in the lion's skin.\r\n\r\nBy the device therefore of his motto, it became impracticable for any\r\nman to presume to imitate the Spectators, without understanding at\r\nleast one sentence in the learned languages. In the same manner I have\r\nnow secured myself from the imitation of those who are utterly\r\nincapable of any degree of reflection, and whose learning is not equal\r\nto an essay.\r\n\r\nI would not be here understood to insinuate, that the greatest merit\r\nof such historical productions can ever lie in these introductory\r\nchapters; but, in fact, those parts which contain mere narrative only,\r\nafford much more encouragement to the pen of an imitator, than those\r\nwhich are composed of observation and reflection. Here I mean such\r\nimitators as Rowe was of Shakespear, or as Horace hints some of the\r\nRomans were of Cato, by bare feet and sour faces.\r\n\r\nTo invent good stories, and to tell them well, are possibly very rare\r\ntalents, and yet I have observed few persons who have scrupled to aim\r\nat both: and if we examine the romances and novels with which the\r\nworld abounds, I think we may fairly conclude, that most of the\r\nauthors would not have attempted to show their teeth (if the\r\nexpression may be allowed me) in any other way of writing; nor could\r\nindeed have strung together a dozen sentences on any other subject\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\n _Scribimus indocti doctique passim_,[*]\r\n\r\n [*] --Each desperate blockhead dares to write:\r\n Verse is the trade of every living wight.--FRANCIS.\r\n\r\nmay be more truly said of the historian and biographer, than of any\r\nother species of writing; for all the arts and sciences (even\r\ncriticism itself) require some little degree of learning and\r\nknowledge. Poetry, indeed, may perhaps be thought an exception; but\r\nthen it demands numbers, or something like numbers: whereas, to the\r\ncomposition of novels and romances, nothing is necessary but paper,\r\npens, and ink, with the manual capacity of using them. This, I\r\nconceive, their productions show to be the opinion of the authors\r\nthemselves: and this must be the opinion of their readers, if indeed\r\nthere be any such.\r\n\r\nHence we are to derive that universal contempt which the world, who\r\nalways denominate the whole from the majority, have cast on all\r\nhistorical writers who do not draw their materials from records. And\r\nit is the apprehension of this contempt that hath made us so\r\ncautiously avoid the term romance, a name with which we might\r\notherwise have been well enough contented. Though, as we have good\r\nauthority for all our characters, no less indeed than the vast\r\nauthentic doomsday-book of nature, as is elsewhere hinted, our labours\r\nhave sufficient title to the name of history. Certainly they deserve\r\nsome distinction from those works, which one of the wittiest of men\r\nregarded only as proceeding from a _pruritus_, or indeed rather from a\r\nlooseness of the brain.\r\n\r\nBut besides the dishonour which is thus cast on one of the most useful\r\nas well as entertaining of all kinds of writing, there is just reason\r\nto apprehend, that by encouraging such authors we shall propagate much\r\ndishonour of another kind; I mean to the characters of many good and\r\nvaluable members of society; for the dullest writers, no more than the\r\ndullest companions, are always inoffensive. They have both enough of\r\nlanguage to be indecent and abusive. And surely if the opinion just\r\nabove cited be true, we cannot wonder that works so nastily derived\r\nshould be nasty themselves, or have a tendency to make others so.\r\n\r\nTo prevent therefore, for the future, such intemperate abuses of\r\nleisure, of letters, and of the liberty of the press, especially as\r\nthe world seems at present to be more than usually threatened with\r\nthem, I shall here venture to mention some qualifications, every one\r\nof which are in a pretty high degree necessary to this order of\r\nhistorians.\r\n\r\nThe first is, genius, without a full vein of which no study, says\r\nHorace, can avail us. By genius I would understand that power or\r\nrather those powers of the mind, which are capable of penetrating into\r\nall things within our reach and knowledge, and of distinguishing their\r\nessential differences. These are no other than invention and judgment;\r\nand they are both called by the collective name of genius, as they are\r\nof those gifts of nature which we bring with us into the world.\r\nConcerning each of which many seem to have fallen into very great\r\nerrors; for by invention, I believe, is generally understood a\r\ncreative faculty, which would indeed prove most romance writers to\r\nhave the highest pretensions to it; whereas by invention is really\r\nmeant no more (and so the word signifies) than discovery, or finding\r\nout; or to explain it at large, a quick and sagacious penetration into\r\nthe true essence of all the objects of our contemplation. This, I\r\nthink, can rarely exist without the concomitancy of judgment; for how\r\nwe can be said to have discovered the true essence of two things,\r\nwithout discerning their difference, seems to me hard to conceive. Now\r\nthis last is the undisputed province of judgment, and yet some few men\r\nof wit have agreed with all the dull fellows in the world in\r\nrepresenting these two to have been seldom or never the property of\r\none and the same person.\r\n\r\nBut though they should be so, they are not sufficient for our purpose,\r\nwithout a good share of learning; for which I could again cite the\r\nauthority of Horace, and of many others, if any was necessary to prove\r\nthat tools are of no service to a workman, when they are not sharpened\r\nby art, or when he wants rules to direct him in his work, or hath no\r\nmatter to work upon. All these uses are supplied by learning; for\r\nnature can only furnish us with capacity; or, as I have chose to\r\nillustrate it, with the tools of our profession; learning must fit\r\nthem for use, must direct them in it, and, lastly, must contribute\r\npart at least of the materials. A competent knowledge of history and\r\nof the belles-lettres is here absolutely necessary; and without this\r\nshare of knowledge at least, to affect the character of an historian,\r\nis as vain as to endeavour at building a house without timber or\r\nmortar, or brick or stone. Homer and Milton, who, though they added\r\nthe ornament of numbers to their works, were both historians of our\r\norder, were masters of all the learning of their times.\r\n\r\nAgain, there is another sort of knowledge, beyond the power of\r\nlearning to bestow, and this is to be had by conversation. So\r\nnecessary is this to the understanding the characters of men, that\r\nnone are more ignorant of them than those learned pedants whose lives\r\nhave been entirely consumed in colleges, and among books; for however\r\nexquisitely human nature may have been described by writers, the true\r\npractical system can be learnt only in the world. Indeed the like\r\nhappens in every other kind of knowledge. Neither physic nor law are\r\nto be practically known from books. Nay, the farmer, the planter, the\r\ngardener, must perfect by experience what he hath acquired the\r\nrudiments of by reading. How accurately soever the ingenious Mr Miller\r\nmay have described the plant, he himself would advise his disciple to\r\nsee it in the garden. As we must perceive, that after the nicest\r\nstrokes of a Shakespear or a Jonson, of a Wycherly or an Otway, some\r\ntouches of nature will escape the reader, which the judicious action\r\nof a Garrick, of a Cibber, or a Clive,[*] can convey to him; so, on the\r\nreal stage, the character shows himself in a stronger and bolder light\r\nthan he can be described. And if this be the case in those fine and\r\nnervous descriptions which great authors themselves have taken from\r\nlife, how much more strongly will it hold when the writer himself\r\ntakes his lines not from nature, but from books? Such characters are\r\nonly the faint copy of a copy, and can have neither the justness nor\r\nspirit of an original.\r\n\r\n [*] There is a peculiar propriety in mentioning this great actor,\r\n and these two most justly celebrated actresses, in this place, as\r\n they have all formed themselves on the study of nature only, and not\r\n on the imitation of their predecessors. Hence they have been able to\r\n excel all who have gone before them; a degree of merit which the\r\n servile herd of imitators can never possibly arrive at.\r\n\r\nNow this conversation in our historian must be universal, that is,\r\nwith all ranks and degrees of men; for the knowledge of what is called\r\nhigh life will not instruct him in low; nor, _e converso_, will his\r\nbeing acquainted with the inferior part of mankind teach him the\r\nmanners of the superior. And though it may be thought that the\r\nknowledge of either may sufficiently enable him to describe at least\r\nthat in which he hath been conversant, yet he will even here fall\r\ngreatly short of perfection; for the follies of either rank do in\r\nreality illustrate each other. For instance, the affectation of high\r\nlife appears more glaring and ridiculous from the simplicity of the\r\nlow; and again, the rudeness and barbarity of this latter, strikes\r\nwith much stronger ideas of absurdity, when contrasted with, and\r\nopposed to, the politeness which controuls the former. Besides, to say\r\nthe truth, the manners of our historian will be improved by both these\r\nconversations; for in the one he will easily find examples of\r\nplainness, honesty, and sincerity; in the other of refinement,\r\nelegance, and a liberality of spirit; which last quality I myself have\r\nscarce ever seen in men of low birth and education.\r\n\r\nNor will all the qualities I have hitherto given my historian avail\r\nhim, unless he have what is generally meant by a good heart, and be\r\ncapable of feeling. The author who will make me weep, says Horace,\r\nmust first weep himself. In reality, no man can paint a distress well\r\nwhich he doth not feel while he is painting it; nor do I doubt, but\r\nthat the most pathetic and affecting scenes have been writ with tears.\r\nIn the same manner it is with the ridiculous. I am convinced I never\r\nmake my reader laugh heartily but where I have laughed before him;\r\nunless it should happen at any time, that instead of laughing with me\r\nhe should be inclined to laugh at me. Perhaps this may have been the\r\ncase at some passages in this chapter, from which apprehension I will\r\nhere put an end to it."

      "content": "Containing a very surprizing adventure indeed, which Mr Jones met with\r\nin his walk with the Man of the Hill.\r\n\nAurora now first opened her casement, _Anglice_ the day began to\r\nbreak, when Jones walked forth in company with the stranger, and\r\nmounted Mazard Hill; of which they had no sooner gained the summit\r\nthan one of the most noble prospects in the world presented itself to\r\ntheir view, and which we would likewise present to the reader, but for\r\ntwo reasons: first, we despair of making those who have seen this\r\nprospect admire our description; secondly, we very much doubt whether\r\nthose who have not seen it would understand it.\r\n\r\nJones stood for some minutes fixed in one posture, and directing his\r\neyes towards the south; upon which the old gentleman asked, What he\r\nwas looking at with so much attention? “Alas! sir,” answered he with a\r\nsigh, “I was endeavouring to trace out my own journey hither. Good\r\nheavens! what a distance is Gloucester from us! What a vast track of\r\nland must be between me and my own home!”--“Ay, ay, young gentleman,”\r\n cries the other, “and by your sighing, from what you love better than\r\nyour own home, or I am mistaken. I perceive now the object of your\r\ncontemplation is not within your sight, and yet I fancy you have a\r\npleasure in looking that way.” Jones answered with a smile, “I find,\r\nold friend, you have not yet forgot the sensations of your youth. I\r\nown my thoughts were employed as you have guessed.”\r\n\r\nThey now walked to that part of the hill which looks to the\r\nnorth-west, and which hangs over a vast and extensive wood. Here they\r\nwere no sooner arrived than they heard at a distance the most violent\r\nscreams of a woman, proceeding from the wood below them. Jones\r\nlistened a moment, and then, without saying a word to his companion\r\n(for indeed the occasion seemed sufficiently pressing), ran, or rather\r\nslid, down the hill, and, without the least apprehension or concern\r\nfor his own safety, made directly to the thicket, whence the sound had\r\nissued.\r\n\r\nHe had not entered far into the wood before he beheld a most shocking\r\nsight indeed, a woman stript half naked, under the hands of a ruffian,\r\nwho had put his garter round her neck, and was endeavouring to draw\r\nher up to a tree. Jones asked no questions at this interval, but fell\r\ninstantly upon the villain, and made such good use of his trusty oaken\r\nstick that he laid him sprawling on the ground before he could defend\r\nhimself, indeed almost before he knew he was attacked; nor did he\r\ncease the prosecution of his blows till the woman herself begged him\r\nto forbear, saying, she believed he had sufficiently done his\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nThe poor wretch then fell upon her knees to Jones, and gave him a\r\nthousand thanks for her deliverance. He presently lifted her up, and\r\ntold her he was highly pleased with the extraordinary accident which\r\nhad sent him thither for her relief, where it was so improbable she\r\nshould find any; adding, that Heaven seemed to have designed him as\r\nthe happy instrument of her protection. “Nay,” answered she, “I could\r\nalmost conceive you to be some good angel; and, to say the truth, you\r\nlook more like an angel than a man in my eye.” Indeed he was a\r\ncharming figure; and if a very fine person, and a most comely set of\r\nfeatures, adorned with youth, health, strength, freshness, spirit, and\r\ngood-nature, can make a man resemble an angel, he certainly had that\r\nresemblance.\r\n\r\nThe redeemed captive had not altogether so much of the human-angelic\r\nspecies: she seemed to be at least of the middle age, nor had her face\r\nmuch appearance of beauty; but her cloaths being torn from all the\r\nupper part of her body, her breasts, which were well formed and\r\nextremely white, attracted the eyes of her deliverer, and for a few\r\nmoments they stood silent, and gazing at each other; till the ruffian\r\non the ground beginning to move, Jones took the garter which had been\r\nintended for another purpose, and bound both his hands behind him. And\r\nnow, on contemplating his face, he discovered, greatly to his\r\nsurprize, and perhaps not a little to his satisfaction, this very\r\nperson to be no other than ensign Northerton. Nor had the ensign\r\nforgotten his former antagonist, whom he knew the moment he came to\r\nhimself. His surprize was equal to that of Jones; but I conceive his\r\npleasure was rather less on this occasion.\r\n\r\nJones helped Northerton upon his legs, and then looking him stedfastly\r\nin the face, “I fancy, sir,” said he, “you did not expect to meet me\r\nany more in this world, and I confess I had as little expectation to\r\nfind you here. However, fortune, I see, hath brought us once more\r\ntogether, and hath given me satisfaction for the injury I have\r\nreceived, even without my own knowledge.”\r\n\r\n“It is very much like a man of honour, indeed,” answered Northerton,\r\n“to take satisfaction by knocking a man down behind his back. Neither\r\nam I capable of giving you satisfaction here, as I have no sword; but\r\nif you dare behave like a gentleman, let us go where I can furnish\r\nmyself with one, and I will do by you as a man of honour ought.”\r\n\r\n“Doth it become such a villain as you are,” cries Jones, “to\r\ncontaminate the name of honour by assuming it? But I shall waste no\r\ntime in discourse with you. Justice requires satisfaction of you now,\r\nand shall have it.” Then turning to the woman, he asked her, if she\r\nwas near her home; or if not, whether she was acquainted with any\r\nhouse in the neighbourhood, where she might procure herself some\r\ndecent cloaths, in order to proceed to a justice of the peace.\r\n\r\nShe answered she was an entire stranger in that part of the world.\r\nJones then recollecting himself, said, he had a friend near who would\r\ndirect them; indeed, he wondered at his not following; but, in fact,\r\nthe good Man of the Hill, when our heroe departed, sat himself down on\r\nthe brow, where, though he had a gun in his hand, he with great\r\npatience and unconcern had attended the issue.\r\n\r\nJones then stepping without the wood, perceived the old man sitting as\r\nwe have just described him; he presently exerted his utmost agility,\r\nand with surprizing expedition ascended the hill.\r\n\r\nThe old man advised him to carry the woman to Upton, which, he said,\r\nwas the nearest town, and there he would be sure of furnishing her\r\nwith all manner of conveniencies. Jones having received his direction\r\nto the place, took his leave of the Man of the Hill, and, desiring him\r\nto direct Partridge the same way, returned hastily to the wood.\r\n\r\nOur heroe, at his departure to make this enquiry of his friend, had\r\nconsidered, that as the ruffian's hands were tied behind him, he was\r\nincapable of executing any wicked purposes on the poor woman. Besides,\r\nhe knew he should not be beyond the reach of her voice, and could\r\nreturn soon enough to prevent any mischief. He had moreover declared\r\nto the villain, that if he attempted the least insult, he would be\r\nhimself immediately the executioner of vengeance on him. But Jones\r\nunluckily forgot, that though the hands of Northerton were tied, his\r\nlegs were at liberty; nor did he lay the least injunction on the\r\nprisoner that he should not make what use of these he pleased.\r\nNortherton therefore having given no parole of that kind, thought he\r\nmight without any breach of honour depart; not being obliged, as he\r\nimagined, by any rules, to wait for a formal discharge. He therefore\r\ntook up his legs, which were at liberty, and walked off through the\r\nwood, which favoured his retreat; nor did the woman, whose eyes were\r\nperhaps rather turned toward her deliverer, once think of his escape,\r\nor give herself any concern or trouble to prevent it.\r\n\r\nJones therefore, at his return, found the woman alone. He would have\r\nspent some time in searching for Northerton, but she would not permit\r\nhim; earnestly entreating that he would accompany her to the town\r\nwhither they had been directed. “As to the fellow's escape,” said she,\r\n“it gives me no uneasiness; for philosophy and Christianity both\r\npreach up forgiveness of injuries. But for you, sir, I am concerned at\r\nthe trouble I give you; nay, indeed, my nakedness may well make me\r\nashamed to look you in the face; and if it was not for the sake of\r\nyour protection, I should wish to go alone.”\r\n\r\nJones offered her his coat; but, I know not for what reason, she\r\nabsolutely refused the most earnest solicitations to accept it. He\r\nthen begged her to forget both the causes of her confusion. “With\r\nregard to the former,” says he, “I have done no more than my duty in\r\nprotecting you; and as for the latter, I will entirely remove it, by\r\nwalking before you all the way; for I would not have my eyes offend\r\nyou, and I could not answer for my power of resisting the attractive\r\ncharms of so much beauty.”\r\n\r\nThus our heroe and the redeemed lady walked in the same manner as\r\nOrpheus and Eurydice marched heretofore; but though I cannot believe\r\nthat Jones was designedly tempted by his fair one to look behind him,\r\nyet as she frequently wanted his assistance to help her over stiles,\r\nand had besides many trips and other accidents, he was often obliged\r\nto turn about. However, he had better fortune than what attended poor\r\nOrpheus, for he brought his companion, or rather follower, safe into\r\nthe famous town of Upton."

      "content": "The arrival of Mr Jones with his lady at the inn; with a very full\r\ndescription of the battle of Upton.\r\n\nThough the reader, we doubt not, is very eager to know who this lady\r\nwas, and how she fell into the hands of Mr Northerton, we must beg him\r\nto suspend his curiosity for a short time, as we are obliged, for some\r\nvery good reasons which hereafter perhaps he may guess, to delay his\r\nsatisfaction a little longer.\r\n\r\nMr Jones and his fair companion no sooner entered the town, than they\r\nwent directly to that inn which in their eyes presented the fairest\r\nappearance to the street. Here Jones, having ordered a servant to show\r\na room above stairs, was ascending, when the dishevelled fair, hastily\r\nfollowing, was laid hold on by the master of the house, who cried,\r\n“Heyday, where is that beggar wench going? Stay below stairs, I desire\r\nyou.” But Jones at that instant thundered from above, “Let the lady\r\ncome up,” in so authoritative a voice, that the good man instantly\r\nwithdrew his hands, and the lady made the best of her way to the\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\nHere Jones wished her joy of her safe arrival, and then departed, in\r\norder, as he promised, to send the landlady up with some cloaths. The\r\npoor woman thanked him heartily for all his kindness, and said, she\r\nhoped she should see him again soon, to thank him a thousand times\r\nmore. During this short conversation, she covered her white bosom as\r\nwell as she could possibly with her arms; for Jones could not avoid\r\nstealing a sly peep or two, though he took all imaginable care to\r\navoid giving any offence.\r\n\r\nOur travellers had happened to take up their residence at a house of\r\nexceeding good repute, whither Irish ladies of strict virtue, and many\r\nnorthern lasses of the same predicament, were accustomed to resort in\r\ntheir way to Bath. The landlady therefore would by no means have\r\nadmitted any conversation of a disreputable kind to pass under her\r\nroof. Indeed, so foul and contagious are all such proceedings, that\r\nthey contaminate the very innocent scenes where they are committed,\r\nand give the name of a bad house, or of a house of ill repute, to all\r\nthose where they are suffered to be carried on.\r\n\r\nNot that I would intimate that such strict chastity as was preserved\r\nin the temple of Vesta can possibly be maintained at a public inn. My\r\ngood landlady did not hope for such a blessing, nor would any of the\r\nladies I have spoken of, or indeed any others of the most rigid note,\r\nhave expected or insisted on any such thing. But to exclude all vulgar\r\nconcubinage, and to drive all whores in rags from within the walls, is\r\nwithin the power of every one. This my landlady very strictly adhered\r\nto, and this her virtuous guests, who did not travel in rags, would\r\nvery reasonably have expected of her.\r\n\r\nNow it required no very blameable degree of suspicion to imagine that\r\nMr Jones and his ragged companion had certain purposes in their\r\nintention, which, though tolerated in some Christian countries,\r\nconnived at in others, and practised in all, are however as expressly\r\nforbidden as murder, or any other horrid vice, by that religion which\r\nis universally believed in those countries. The landlady, therefore,\r\nhad no sooner received an intimation of the entrance of the above-said\r\npersons than she began to meditate the most expeditious means for\r\ntheir expulsion. In order to this, she had provided herself with a\r\nlong and deadly instrument, with which, in times of peace, the\r\nchambermaid was wont to demolish the labours of the industrious\r\nspider. In vulgar phrase, she had taken up the broomstick, and was\r\njust about to sally from the kitchen, when Jones accosted her with a\r\ndemand of a gown and other vestments, to cover the half-naked woman\r\nupstairs.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more provoking to the human temper, nor more dangerous\r\nto that cardinal virtue, patience, than solicitations of extraordinary\r\noffices of kindness on behalf of those very persons with whom we are\r\nhighly incensed. For this reason Shakespear hath artfully introduced\r\nhis Desdemona soliciting favours for Cassio of her husband, as the\r\nmeans of inflaming, not only his jealousy, but his rage, to the\r\nhighest pitch of madness; and we find the unfortunate Moor less able\r\nto command his passion on this occasion, than even when he beheld his\r\nvalued present to his wife in the hands of his supposed rival. In\r\nfact, we regard these efforts as insults on our understanding, and to\r\nsuch the pride of man is very difficultly brought to submit.\r\n\r\nMy landlady, though a very good-tempered woman, had, I suppose, some\r\nof this pride in her composition, for Jones had scarce ended his\r\nrequest, when she fell upon him with a certain weapon, which, though\r\nit be neither long, nor sharp, nor hard, nor indeed threatens from its\r\nappearance with either death or wound, hath been however held in great\r\ndread and abhorrence by many wise men--nay, by many brave ones;\r\ninsomuch, that some who have dared to look into the mouth of a loaded\r\ncannon, have not dared to look into a mouth where this weapon was\r\nbrandished; and rather than run the hazard of its execution, have\r\ncontented themselves with making a most pitiful and sneaking figure in\r\nthe eyes of all their acquaintance.\r\n\r\nTo confess the truth, I am afraid Mr Jones was one of these; for\r\nthough he was attacked and violently belaboured with the aforesaid\r\nweapon, he could not be provoked to make any resistance; but in a most\r\ncowardly manner applied, with many entreaties, to his antagonist to\r\ndesist from pursuing her blows; in plain English, he only begged her\r\nwith the utmost earnestness to hear him; but before he could obtain\r\nhis request, my landlord himself entered into the fray, and embraced\r\nthat side of the cause which seemed to stand very little in need of\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nThere are a sort of heroes who are supposed to be determined in their\r\nchusing or avoiding a conflict by the character and behaviour of the\r\nperson whom they are to engage. These are said to know their men, and\r\nJones, I believe, knew his woman; for though he had been so submissive\r\nto her, he was no sooner attacked by her husband, than he demonstrated\r\nan immediate spirit of resentment, and enjoined him silence under a\r\nvery severe penalty; no less than that, I think, of being converted\r\ninto fuel for his own fire.\r\n\r\nThe husband, with great indignation, but with a mixture of pity,\r\nanswered, “You must pray first to be made able. I believe I am a\r\nbetter man than yourself; ay, every way, that I am;” and presently\r\nproceeded to discharge half-a-dozen whores at the lady above stairs,\r\nthe last of which had scarce issued from his lips, when a swinging\r\nblow from the cudgel that Jones carried in his hand assaulted him over\r\nthe shoulders.\r\n\r\nIt is a question whether the landlord or the landlady was the most\r\nexpeditious in returning this blow. My landlord, whose hands were\r\nempty, fell to with his fist, and the good wife, uplifting her broom\r\nand aiming at the head of Jones, had probably put an immediate end to\r\nthe fray, and to Jones likewise, had not the descent of this broom\r\nbeen prevented--not by the miraculous intervention of any heathen\r\ndeity, but by a very natural though fortunate accident, viz., by the\r\narrival of Partridge; who entered the house at that instant (for fear\r\nhad caused him to run every step from the hill), and who, seeing the\r\ndanger which threatened his master or companion (which you chuse to\r\ncall him), prevented so sad a catastrophe, by catching hold of the\r\nlandlady's arm, as it was brandished aloft in the air.\r\n\r\nThe landlady soon perceived the impediment which prevented her blow;\r\nand being unable to rescue her arm from the hands of Partridge, she\r\nlet fall the broom; and then leaving Jones to the discipline of her\r\nhusband, she fell with the utmost fury on that poor fellow, who had\r\nalready given some intimation of himself, by crying, “Zounds! do you\r\nintend to kill my friend?”\r\n\r\nPartridge, though not much addicted to battle, would not however stand\r\nstill when his friend was attacked; nor was he much displeased with\r\nthat part of the combat which fell to his share; he therefore returned\r\nmy landlady's blows as soon as he received them: and now the fight was\r\nobstinately maintained on all parts, and it seemed doubtful to which\r\nside Fortune would incline, when the naked lady, who had listened at\r\nthe top of the stairs to the dialogue which preceded the engagement,\r\ndescended suddenly from above, and without weighing the unfair\r\ninequality of two to one, fell upon the poor woman who was boxing with\r\nPartridge; nor did that great champion desist, but rather redoubled\r\nhis fury, when he found fresh succours were arrived to his assistance.\r\n\r\nVictory must now have fallen to the side of the travellers (for the\r\nbravest troops must yield to numbers) had not Susan the chambermaid\r\ncome luckily to support her mistress. This Susan was as two-handed a\r\nwench (according to the phrase) as any in the country, and would, I\r\nbelieve, have beat the famed Thalestris herself, or any of her subject\r\nAmazons; for her form was robust and man-like, and every way made for\r\nsuch encounters. As her hands and arms were formed to give blows with\r\ngreat mischief to an enemy, so was her face as well contrived to\r\nreceive blows without any great injury to herself, her nose being\r\nalready flat to her face; her lips were so large, that no swelling\r\ncould be perceived in them, and moreover they were so hard, that a\r\nfist could hardly make any impression on them. Lastly, her cheek-bones\r\nstood out, as if nature had intended them for two bastions to defend\r\nher eyes in those encounters for which she seemed so well calculated,\r\nand to which she was most wonderfully well inclined.\r\n\r\nThis fair creature entering the field of battle, immediately filed to\r\nthat wing where her mistress maintained so unequal a fight with one of\r\neither sex. Here she presently challenged Partridge to single combat.\r\nHe accepted the challenge, and a most desperate fight began between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nNow the dogs of war being let loose, began to lick their bloody lips;\r\nnow Victory, with golden wings, hung hovering in the air; now Fortune,\r\ntaking her scales from her shelf, began to weigh the fates of Tom\r\nJones, his female companion, and Partridge, against the landlord, his\r\nwife, and maid; all which hung in exact balance before her; when a\r\ngood-natured accident put suddenly an end to the bloody fray, with\r\nwhich half of the combatants had already sufficiently feasted. This\r\naccident was the arrival of a coach and four; upon which my landlord\r\nand landlady immediately desisted from fighting, and at their entreaty\r\nobtained the same favour of their antagonists: but Susan was not so\r\nkind to Partridge; for that Amazonian fair having overthrown and\r\nbestrid her enemy, was now cuffing him lustily with both her hands,\r\nwithout any regard to his request of a cessation of arms, or to those\r\nloud exclamations of murder which he roared forth.\r\n\r\nNo sooner, however, had Jones quitted the landlord, than he flew to\r\nthe rescue of his defeated companion, from whom he with much\r\ndifficulty drew off the enraged chambermaid: but Partridge was not\r\nimmediately sensible of his deliverance, for he still lay flat on the\r\nfloor, guarding his face with his hands; nor did he cease roaring till\r\nJones had forced him to look up, and to perceive that the battle was\r\nat an end.\r\n\r\nThe landlord, who had no visible hurt, and the landlady, hiding her\r\nwell-scratched face with her handkerchief, ran both hastily to the\r\ndoor to attend the coach, from which a young lady and her maid now\r\nalighted. These the landlady presently ushered into that room where Mr\r\nJones had at first deposited his fair prize, as it was the best\r\napartment in the house. Hither they were obliged to pass through the\r\nfield of battle, which they did with the utmost haste, covering their\r\nfaces with their handkerchiefs, as desirous to avoid the notice of any\r\none. Indeed their caution was quite unnecessary; for the poor\r\nunfortunate Helen, the fatal cause of all the bloodshed, was entirely\r\ntaken up in endeavouring to conceal her own face, and Jones was no\r\nless occupied in rescuing Partridge from the fury of Susan; which\r\nbeing happily effected, the poor fellow immediately departed to the\r\npump to wash his face, and to stop that bloody torrent which Susan had\r\nplentifully set a-flowing from his nostrils."

      "content": "In which the arrival of a man of war puts a final end to hostilities,\r\nand causes the conclusion of a firm and lasting peace between all\r\nparties.\r\n\nA serjeant and a file of musqueteers, with a deserter in their\r\ncustody, arrived about this time. The serjeant presently enquired for\r\nthe principal magistrate of the town, and was informed by my landlord,\r\nthat he himself was vested in that office. He then demanded his\r\nbillets, together with a mug of beer, and complaining it was cold,\r\nspread himself before the kitchen fire.\r\n\r\nMr Jones was at this time comforting the poor distressed lady, who sat\r\ndown at a table in the kitchen, and leaning her head upon her arm, was\r\nbemoaning her misfortunes; but lest my fair readers should be in pain\r\nconcerning a particular circumstance, I think proper here to acquaint\r\nthem, that before she had quitted the room above stairs, she had so\r\nwell covered herself with a pillowbeer which she there found, that her\r\nregard to decency was not in the least violated by the presence of so\r\nmany men as were now in the room.\r\n\r\nOne of the soldiers now went up to the serjeant, and whispered\r\nsomething in his ear; upon which he stedfastly fixed his eyes on the\r\nlady, and having looked at her for near a minute, he came up to her,\r\nsaying, “I ask pardon, madam; but I am certain I am not deceived; you\r\ncan be no other person than Captain Waters's lady?”\r\n\r\nThe poor woman, who in her present distress had very little regarded\r\nthe face of any person present, no sooner looked at the serjeant than\r\nshe presently recollected him, and calling him by his name, answered,\r\n“That she was indeed the unhappy person he imagined her to be;” but\r\nadded, “I wonder any one should know me in this disguise.” To which\r\nthe serjeant replied, “He was very much surprized to see her ladyship\r\nin such a dress, and was afraid some accident had happened to\r\nher.”--“An accident hath happened to me, indeed,” says she, “and I am\r\nhighly obliged to this gentleman” (pointing to Jones) “that it was not\r\na fatal one, or that I am now living to mention it.”--“Whatever the\r\ngentleman hath done,” cries the serjeant, “I am sure the captain will\r\nmake him amends for it; and if I can be of any service, your ladyship\r\nmay command me, and I shall think myself very happy to have it in my\r\npower to serve your ladyship; and so indeed may any one, for I know\r\nthe captain will well reward them for it.”\r\n\r\nThe landlady, who heard from the stairs all that past between the\r\nserjeant and Mrs Waters, came hastily down, and running directly up to\r\nher, began to ask pardon for the offences she had committed, begging\r\nthat all might be imputed to ignorance of her quality: for, “Lud!\r\nmadam,” says she, “how should I have imagined that a lady of your\r\nfashion would appear in such a dress? I am sure, madam, if I had once\r\nsuspected that your ladyship was your ladyship, I would sooner have\r\nburnt my tongue out, than have said what I have said; and I hope your\r\nladyship will accept of a gown, till you can get your own cloaths.”\r\n\r\n“Prithee, woman,” says Mrs Waters, “cease your impertinence: how can\r\nyou imagine I should concern myself about anything which comes from\r\nthe lips of such low creatures as yourself? But I am surprized at your\r\nassurance in thinking, after what is past, that I will condescend to\r\nput on any of your dirty things. I would have you know, creature, I\r\nhave a spirit above that.”\r\n\r\nHere Jones interfered, and begged Mrs Waters to forgive the landlady,\r\nand to accept her gown: “for I must confess,” cries he, “our\r\nappearance was a little suspicious when first we came in; and I am\r\nwell assured all this good woman did was, as she professed, out of\r\nregard to the reputation of her house.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, upon my truly was it,” says she: “the gentleman speaks very much\r\nlike a gentleman, and I see very plainly is so; and to be certain the\r\nhouse is well known to be a house of as good reputation as any on the\r\nroad, and though I say it, is frequented by gentry of the best\r\nquality, both Irish and English. I defy anybody to say black is my\r\neye, for that matter. And, as I was saying, if I had known your\r\nladyship to be your ladyship, I would as soon have burnt my fingers as\r\nhave affronted your ladyship; but truly where gentry come and spend\r\ntheir money, I am not willing that they should be scandalized by a set\r\nof poor shabby vermin, that, wherever they go, leave more lice than\r\nmoney behind them; such folks never raise my compassion, for to be\r\ncertain it is foolish to have any for them; and if our justices did as\r\nthey ought, they would be all whipt out of the kingdom, for to be\r\ncertain it is what is most fitting for them. But as for your ladyship,\r\nI am heartily sorry your ladyship hath had a misfortune, and if your\r\nladyship will do me the honour to wear my cloaths till you can get\r\nsome of your ladyship's own, to be certain the best I have is at your\r\nladyship's service.”\r\n\r\nWhether cold, shame, or the persuasions of Mr Jones prevailed most on\r\nMrs Waters, I will not determine, but she suffered herself to be\r\npacified by this speech of my landlady, and retired with that good\r\nwoman, in order to apparel herself in a decent manner.\r\n\r\nMy landlord was likewise beginning his oration to Jones, but was\r\npresently interrupted by that generous youth, who shook him heartily\r\nby the hand, and assured him of entire forgiveness, saying, “If you\r\nare satisfied, my worthy friend, I promise you I am;” and indeed, in\r\none sense, the landlord had the better reason to be satisfied; for he\r\nhad received a bellyfull of drubbing, whereas Jones had scarce felt a\r\nsingle blow.\r\n\r\nPartridge, who had been all this time washing his bloody nose at the\r\npump, returned into the kitchen at the instant when his master and the\r\nlandlord were shaking hands with each other. As he was of a peaceable\r\ndisposition, he was pleased with those symptoms of reconciliation; and\r\nthough his face bore some marks of Susan's fist, and many more of her\r\nnails, he rather chose to be contented with his fortune in the last\r\nbattle than to endeavour at bettering it in another.\r\n\r\nThe heroic Susan was likewise well contented with her victory, though\r\nit had cost her a black eye, which Partridge had given her at the\r\nfirst onset. Between these two, therefore, a league was struck, and\r\nthose hands which had been the instruments of war became now the\r\nmediators of peace.\r\n\r\nMatters were thus restored to a perfect calm; at which the serjeant,\r\nthough it may seem so contrary to the principles of his profession,\r\ntestified his approbation. “Why now, that's friendly,” said he; “d--n\r\nme, I hate to see two people bear ill-will to one another after they\r\nhave had a tussel. The only way when friends quarrel is to see it out\r\nfairly in a friendly manner, as a man may call it, either with a fist,\r\nor sword, or pistol, according as they like, and then let it be all\r\nover; for my own part, d--n me if ever I love my friend better than\r\nwhen I am fighting with him! To bear malice is more like a Frenchman\r\nthan an Englishman.”\r\n\r\nHe then proposed a libation as a necessary part of the ceremony at all\r\ntreaties of this kind. Perhaps the reader may here conclude that he\r\nwas well versed in antient history; but this, though highly probable,\r\nas he cited no authority to support the custom, I will not affirm with\r\nany confidence. Most likely indeed it is, that he founded his opinion\r\non very good authority, since he confirmed it with many violent oaths.\r\n\r\nJones no sooner heard the proposal than, immediately agreeing with the\r\nlearned serjeant, he ordered a bowl, or rather a large mug, filled\r\nwith the liquor used on these occasions, to be brought in, and then\r\nbegan the ceremony himself. He placed his right hand in that of the\r\nlandlord, and, seizing the bowl with his left, uttered the usual\r\nwords, and then made his libation. After which, the same was observed\r\nby all present. Indeed, there is very little need of being particular\r\nin describing the whole form, as it differed so little from those\r\nlibations of which so much is recorded in antient authors and their\r\nmodern transcribers. The principal difference lay in two instances;\r\nfor, first, the present company poured the liquor only down their\r\nthroats; and, secondly, the serjeant, who officiated as priest, drank\r\nthe last; but he preserved, I believe, the antient form, in swallowing\r\nmuch the largest draught of the whole company, and in being the only\r\nperson present who contributed nothing towards the libation besides\r\nhis good offices in assisting at the performance.\r\n\r\nThe good people now ranged themselves round the kitchen fire, where\r\ngood humour seemed to maintain an absolute dominion; and Partridge not\r\nonly forgot his shameful defeat, but converted hunger into thirst, and\r\nsoon became extremely facetious. We must however quit this agreeable\r\nassembly for a while, and attend Mr Jones to Mrs Waters's apartment,\r\nwhere the dinner which he had bespoke was now on the table. Indeed, it\r\ntook no long time in preparing, having been all drest three days\r\nbefore, and required nothing more from the cook than to warm it over\r\nagain."

      "content": "An apology for all heroes who have good stomachs, with a description\r\nof a battle of the amorous kind.\r\n\nHeroes, notwithstanding the high ideas which, by the means of\r\nflatterers, they may entertain of themselves, or the world may\r\nconceive of them, have certainly more of mortal than divine about\r\nthem. However elevated their minds may be, their bodies at least\r\n(which is much the major part of most) are liable to the worst\r\ninfirmities, and subject to the vilest offices of human nature. Among\r\nthese latter, the act of eating, which hath by several wise men been\r\nconsidered as extremely mean and derogatory from the philosophic\r\ndignity, must be in some measure performed by the greatest prince,\r\nheroe, or philosopher upon earth; nay, sometimes Nature hath been so\r\nfrolicsome as to exact of these dignified characters a much more\r\nexorbitant share of this office than she hath obliged those of the\r\nlowest order to perform.\r\n\r\nTo say the truth, as no known inhabitant of this globe is really more\r\nthan man, so none need be ashamed of submitting to what the\r\nnecessities of man demand; but when those great personages I have just\r\nmentioned condescend to aim at confining such low offices to\r\nthemselves--as when, by hoarding or destroying, they seem desirous to\r\nprevent any others from eating--then they surely become very low and\r\ndespicable.\r\n\r\nNow, after this short preface, we think it no disparagement to our\r\nheroe to mention the immoderate ardour with which he laid about him at\r\nthis season. Indeed, it may be doubted whether Ulysses, who by the way\r\nseems to have had the best stomach of all the heroes in that eating\r\npoem of the Odyssey, ever made a better meal. Three pounds at least of\r\nthat flesh which formerly had contributed to the composition of an ox\r\nwas now honoured with becoming part of the individual Mr Jones.\r\n\r\nThis particular we thought ourselves obliged to mention, as it may\r\naccount for our heroe's temporary neglect of his fair companion, who\r\neat but very little, and was indeed employed in considerations of a\r\nvery different nature, which passed unobserved by Jones, till he had\r\nentirely satisfied that appetite which a fast of twenty-four hours had\r\nprocured him; but his dinner was no sooner ended than his attention to\r\nother matters revived; with these matters therefore we shall now\r\nproceed to acquaint the reader.\r\n\r\nMr Jones, of whose personal accomplishments we have hitherto said very\r\nlittle, was, in reality, one of the handsomest young fellows in the\r\nworld. His face, besides being the picture of health, had in it the\r\nmost apparent marks of sweetness and good-nature. These qualities were\r\nindeed so characteristical in his countenance, that, while the spirit\r\nand sensibility in his eyes, though they must have been perceived by\r\nan accurate observer, might have escaped the notice of the less\r\ndiscerning, so strongly was this good-nature painted in his look, that\r\nit was remarked by almost every one who saw him.\r\n\r\nIt was, perhaps, as much owing to this as to a very fine complexion\r\nthat his face had a delicacy in it almost inexpressible, and which\r\nmight have given him an air rather too effeminate, had it not been\r\njoined to a most masculine person and mien: which latter had as much\r\nin them of the Hercules as the former had of the Adonis. He was\r\nbesides active, genteel, gay, and good-humoured; and had a flow of\r\nanimal spirits which enlivened every conversation where he was\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nWhen the reader hath duly reflected on these many charms which all\r\ncentered in our heroe, and considers at the same time the fresh\r\nobligations which Mrs Waters had to him, it will be a mark more of\r\nprudery than candour to entertain a bad opinion of her because she\r\nconceived a very good opinion of him.\r\n\r\nBut, whatever censures may be passed upon her, it is my business to\r\nrelate matters of fact with veracity. Mrs Waters had, in truth, not\r\nonly a good opinion of our heroe, but a very great affection for him.\r\nTo speak out boldly at once, she was in love, according to the present\r\nuniversally-received sense of that phrase, by which love is applied\r\nindiscriminately to the desirable objects of all our passions,\r\nappetites, and senses, and is understood to be that preference which\r\nwe give to one kind of food rather than to another.\r\n\r\nBut though the love to these several objects may possibly be one and\r\nthe same in all cases, its operations however must be allowed to be\r\ndifferent; for, how much soever we may be in love with an excellent\r\nsurloin of beef, or bottle of Burgundy; with a damask rose, or Cremona\r\nfiddle; yet do we never smile, nor ogle, nor dress, nor flatter, nor\r\nendeavour by any other arts or tricks to gain the affection of the\r\nsaid beef, &c. Sigh indeed we sometimes may; but it is generally in\r\nthe absence, not in the presence, of the beloved object. For otherwise\r\nwe might possibly complain of their ingratitude and deafness, with the\r\nsame reason as Pasiphae doth of her bull, whom she endeavoured to\r\nengage by all the coquetry practised with good success in the\r\ndrawing-room on the much more sensible as well as tender hearts of the\r\nfine gentlemen there.\r\n\r\nThe contrary happens in that love which operates between persons of\r\nthe same species, but of different sexes. Here we are no sooner in\r\nlove than it becomes our principal care to engage the affection of the\r\nobject beloved. For what other purpose indeed are our youth instructed\r\nin all the arts of rendering themselves agreeable? If it was not with\r\na view to this love, I question whether any of those trades which deal\r\nin setting off and adorning the human person would procure a\r\nlivelihood. Nay, those great polishers of our manners, who are by some\r\nthought to teach what principally distinguishes us from the brute\r\ncreation, even dancing-masters themselves, might possibly find no\r\nplace in society. In short, all the graces which young ladies and\r\nyoung gentlemen too learn from others, and the many improvements\r\nwhich, by the help of a looking-glass, they add of their own, are in\r\nreality those very _spicula et faces amoris_ so often mentioned by\r\nOvid; or, as they are sometimes called in our own language, the whole\r\nartillery of love.\r\n\r\nNow Mrs Waters and our heroe had no sooner sat down together than the\r\nformer began to play this artillery upon the latter. But here, as we\r\nare about to attempt a description hitherto unassayed either in prose\r\nor verse, we think proper to invoke the assistance of certain aërial\r\nbeings, who will, we doubt not, come kindly to our aid on this\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n“Say then, ye Graces! you that inhabit the heavenly mansions of\r\nSeraphina's countenance; for you are truly divine, are always in her\r\npresence, and well know all the arts of charming; say, what were the\r\nweapons now used to captivate the heart of Mr Jones.”\r\n\r\n“First, from two lovely blue eyes, whose bright orbs flashed lightning\r\nat their discharge, flew forth two pointed ogles; but, happily for our\r\nheroe, hit only a vast piece of beef which he was then conveying into\r\nhis plate, and harmless spent their force. The fair warrior perceived\r\ntheir miscarriage, and immediately from her fair bosom drew forth a\r\ndeadly sigh. A sigh which none could have heard unmoved, and which was\r\nsufficient at once to have swept off a dozen beaus; so soft, so sweet,\r\nso tender, that the insinuating air must have found its subtle way to\r\nthe heart of our heroe, had it not luckily been driven from his ears\r\nby the coarse bubbling of some bottled ale, which at that time he was\r\npouring forth. Many other weapons did she assay; but the god of eating\r\n(if there be any such deity, for I do not confidently assert it)\r\npreserved his votary; or perhaps it may not be _dignus vindice nodus_,\r\nand the present security of Jones may be accounted for by natural\r\nmeans; for as love frequently preserves from the attacks of hunger, so\r\nmay hunger possibly, in some cases, defend us against love.\r\n\r\n“The fair one, enraged at her frequent disappointments, determined on\r\na short cessation of arms. Which interval she employed in making ready\r\nevery engine of amorous warfare for the renewing of the attack when\r\ndinner should be over.\r\n\r\n“No sooner then was the cloth removed than she again began her\r\noperations. First, having planted her right eye sidewise against Mr\r\nJones, she shot from its corner a most penetrating glance; which,\r\nthough great part of its force was spent before it reached our heroe,\r\ndid not vent itself absolutely without effect. This the fair one\r\nperceiving, hastily withdrew her eyes, and levelled them downwards, as\r\nif she was concerned for what she had done; though by this means she\r\ndesigned only to draw him from his guard, and indeed to open his eyes,\r\nthrough which she intended to surprize his heart. And now, gently\r\nlifting up those two bright orbs which had already begun to make an\r\nimpression on poor Jones, she discharged a volley of small charms at\r\nonce from her whole countenance in a smile. Not a smile of mirth, nor\r\nof joy; but a smile of affection, which most ladies have always ready\r\nat their command, and which serves them to show at once their\r\ngood-humour, their pretty dimples, and their white teeth.\r\n\r\n“This smile our heroe received full in his eyes, and was immediately\r\nstaggered with its force. He then began to see the designs of the\r\nenemy, and indeed to feel their success. A parley now was set on foot\r\nbetween the parties; during which the artful fair so slily and\r\nimperceptibly carried on her attack, that she had almost subdued the\r\nheart of our heroe before she again repaired to acts of hostility. To\r\nconfess the truth, I am afraid Mr Jones maintained a kind of Dutch\r\ndefence, and treacherously delivered up the garrison, without duly\r\nweighing his allegiance to the fair Sophia. In short, no sooner had\r\nthe amorous parley ended and the lady had unmasked the royal battery,\r\nby carelessly letting her handkerchief drop from her neck, than the\r\nheart of Mr Jones was entirely taken, and the fair conqueror enjoyed\r\nthe usual fruits of her victory.”\r\n\r\nHere the Graces think proper to end their description, and here we\r\nthink proper to end the chapter."

      "content": "A friendly conversation in the kitchen, which had a very common,\r\nthough not very friendly, conclusion.\r\n\nWhile our lovers were entertaining themselves in the manner which is\r\npartly described in the foregoing chapter, they were likewise\r\nfurnishing out an entertainment for their good friends in the kitchen.\r\nAnd this in a double sense, by affording them matter for their\r\nconversation, and, at the same time, drink to enliven their spirits.\r\n\r\nThere were now assembled round the kitchen fire, besides my landlord\r\nand landlady, who occasionally went backward and forward, Mr\r\nPartridge, the serjeant, and the coachman who drove the young lady and\r\nher maid.\r\n\r\nPartridge having acquainted the company with what he had learnt from\r\nthe Man of the Hill concerning the situation in which Mrs Waters had\r\nbeen found by Jones, the serjeant proceeded to that part of her\r\nhistory which was known to him. He said she was the wife of Mr Waters,\r\nwho was a captain in their regiment, and had often been with him at\r\nquarters. “Some folks,” says he, “used indeed to doubt whether they\r\nwere lawfully married in a church or no. But, for my part, that's no\r\nbusiness of mine: I must own, if I was put to my corporal oath, I\r\nbelieve she is little better than one of us; and I fancy the captain\r\nmay go to heaven when the sun shines upon a rainy day. But if he does,\r\nthat is neither here nor there; for he won't want company. And the\r\nlady, to give the devil his due, is a very good sort of lady, and\r\nloves the cloth, and is always desirous to do strict justice to it;\r\nfor she hath begged off many a poor soldier, and, by her good-will,\r\nwould never have any of them punished. But yet, to be sure, Ensign\r\nNortherton and she were very well acquainted together at our last\r\nquarters; that is the very right and truth of the matter. But the\r\ncaptain he knows nothing about it; and as long as there is enough for\r\nhim too, what does it signify? He loves her not a bit the worse, and I\r\nam certain would run any man through the body that was to abuse her;\r\ntherefore I won't abuse her, for my part. I only repeat what other\r\nfolks say; and, to be certain, what everybody says, there must be some\r\ntruth in.”--“Ay, ay, a great deal of truth, I warrant you,” cries\r\nPartridge; “_Veritas odium parit_”--“All a parcel of scandalous\r\nstuff,” answered the mistress of the house. “I am sure, now she is\r\ndrest, she looks like a very good sort of lady, and she behaves\r\nherself like one; for she gave me a guinea for the use of my\r\ncloaths.”--“A very good lady indeed!” cries the landlord; “and if you\r\nhad not been a little too hasty, you would not have quarrelled with\r\nher as you did at first.”--“You need mention that with my truly!”\r\n answered she: “if it had not been for your nonsense, nothing had\r\nhappened. You must be meddling with what did not belong to you, and\r\nthrow in your fool's discourse.”--“Well, well,” answered he; “what's\r\npast cannot be mended, so there's an end of the matter.”--“Yes,” cries\r\nshe, “for this once; but will it be mended ever the more hereafter?\r\nThis is not the first time I have suffered for your numscull's pate. I\r\nwish you would always hold your tongue in the house, and meddle only\r\nin matters without doors, which concern you. Don't you remember what\r\nhappened about seven years ago?”--“Nay, my dear,” returned he, “don't\r\nrip up old stories. Come, come, all's well, and I am sorry for what I\r\nhave done.” The landlady was going to reply, but was prevented by the\r\npeace-making serjeant, sorely to the displeasure of Partridge, who was\r\na great lover of what is called fun, and a great promoter of those\r\nharmless quarrels which tend rather to the production of comical than\r\ntragical incidents.\r\n\r\nThe serjeant asked Partridge whither he and his master were travelling?\r\n“None of your magisters,” answered Partridge; “I am no man's servant, I\r\nassure you; for, though I have had misfortunes in the world, I write\r\ngentleman after my name; and, as poor and simple as I may appear now, I\r\nhave taught grammar-school in my time; _sed hei mihi! non sum quod\r\nfui_.”--“No offence, I hope, sir,” said the serjeant; “where, then, if\r\nI may venture to be so bold, may you and your friend be\r\ntravelling?”--“You have now denominated us right,” says Partridge.\r\n“_Amici sumus._ And I promise you my friend is one of the greatest\r\ngentlemen in the kingdom” (at which words both landlord and landlady\r\npricked up their ears). “He is the heir of Squire Allworthy.”--“What,\r\nthe squire who doth so much good all over the country?” cries my\r\nlandlady. “Even he,” answered Partridge.--“Then I warrant,” says she,\r\n“he'll have a swinging great estate hereafter.”--“Most certainly,”\r\n answered Partridge.--“Well,” replied the landlady, “I thought the first\r\nmoment I saw him he looked like a good sort of gentleman; but my\r\nhusband here, to be sure, is wiser than anybody.”--“I own, my dear,”\r\n cries he, “it was a mistake.”--“A mistake, indeed!” answered she; “but\r\nwhen did you ever know me to make such mistakes?”--“But how comes it,\r\nsir,” cries the landlord, “that such a great gentleman walks about the\r\ncountry afoot?”--“I don't know,” returned Partridge; “great gentlemen\r\nhave humours sometimes. He hath now a dozen horses and servants at\r\nGloucester; and nothing would serve him, but last night, it being very\r\nhot weather, he must cool himself with a walk to yon high hill, whither\r\nI likewise walked with him to bear him company; but if ever you catch\r\nme there again: for I was never so frightened in all my life. We met\r\nwith the strangest man there.”--“I'll be hanged,” cries the landlord,\r\n“if it was not the Man of the Hill, as they call him; if indeed he be a\r\nman; but I know several people who believe it is the devil that lives\r\nthere.”--“Nay, nay, like enough,” says Partridge; “and now you put me\r\nin the head of it, I verily and sincerely believe it was the devil,\r\nthough I could not perceive his cloven foot: but perhaps he might have\r\nthe power given him to hide that, since evil spirits can appear in what\r\nshapes they please.”--“And pray, sir,” says the serjeant, “no offence,\r\nI hope; but pray what sort of a gentleman is the devil? For I have\r\nheard some of our officers say there is no such person; and that it is\r\nonly a trick of the parsons, to prevent their being broke; for, if it\r\nwas publickly known that there was no devil, the parsons would be of no\r\nmore use than we are in time of peace.”--“Those officers,” says\r\nPartridge, “are very great scholars, I suppose.”--“Not much of\r\nschollards neither,” answered the serjeant; “they have not half your\r\nlearning, sir, I believe; and, to be sure, I thought there must be a\r\ndevil, notwithstanding what they said, though one of them was a\r\ncaptain; for methought, thinks I to myself, if there be no devil, how\r\ncan wicked people be sent to him? and I have read all that upon a\r\nbook.”--“Some of your officers,” quoth the landlord, “will find there\r\nis a devil, to their shame, I believe. I don't question but he'll pay\r\noff some old scores upon my account. Here was one quartered upon me\r\nhalf a year, who had the conscience to take up one of my best beds,\r\nthough he hardly spent a shilling a day in the house, and suffered his\r\nmen to roast cabbages at the kitchen fire, because I would not give\r\nthem a dinner on a Sunday. Every good Christian must desire there\r\nshould be a devil for the punishment of such wretches.”--“Harkee,\r\nlandlord,” said the serjeant, “don't abuse the cloth, for I won't take\r\nit.”--“D--n the cloth!” answered the landlord, “I have suffered enough\r\nby them.”--“Bear witness, gentlemen,” says the serjeant, “he curses the\r\nking, and that's high treason.”--“I curse the king! you villain,” said\r\nthe landlord. “Yes, you did,” cries the serjeant; “you cursed the\r\ncloth, and that's cursing the king. It's all one and the same; for\r\nevery man who curses the cloth would curse the king if he durst; so for\r\nmatter o' that, it's all one and the same thing.”--“Excuse me there, Mr\r\nSerjeant,” quoth Partridge, “that's a _non sequitur_.”--“None of your\r\noutlandish linguo,” answered the serjeant, leaping from his seat; “I\r\nwill not sit still and hear the cloth abused.”--“You mistake me,\r\nfriend,” cries Partridge. “I did not mean to abuse the cloth; I only\r\nsaid your conclusion was a _non sequitur_.[*]”--“You\r\nare another,” cries the serjeant,” an you come to that. No more a\r\n_sequitur_ than yourself. You are a pack of rascals, and I'll prove it;\r\nfor I will fight the best man of you all for twenty pound.” This\r\nchallenge effectually silenced Partridge, whose stomach for drubbing\r\ndid not so soon return after the hearty meal which he had lately been\r\ntreated with; but the coachman, whose bones were less sore, and whose\r\nappetite for fighting was somewhat sharper, did not so easily brook the\r\naffront, of which he conceived some part at least fell to his share. He\r\nstarted therefore from his seat, and, advancing to the serjeant, swore\r\nhe looked on himself to be as good a man as any in the army, and\r\noffered to box for a guinea. The military man accepted the combat, but\r\nrefused the wager; upon which both immediately stript and engaged, till\r\nthe driver of horses was so well mauled by the leader of men, that he\r\nwas obliged to exhaust his small remainder of breath in begging for\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\n [*] This word, which the serjeant unhappily mistook for an affront,\r\n is a term in logic, and means that the conclusion does not follow\r\n from the premises.\r\n\r\nThe young lady was now desirous to depart, and had given orders for\r\nher coach to be prepared; but all in vain, for the coachman was\r\ndisabled from performing his office for that evening. An antient\r\nheathen would perhaps have imputed this disability to the god of\r\ndrink, no less than to the god of war; for, in reality, both the\r\ncombatants had sacrificed as well to the former deity as to the\r\nlatter. To speak plainly, they were both dead drunk, nor was Partridge\r\nin a much better situation. As for my landlord, drinking was his\r\ntrade; and the liquor had no more effect on him than it had on any\r\nother vessel in his house.\r\n\r\nThe mistress of the inn, being summoned to attend Mr Jones and his\r\ncompanion at their tea, gave a full relation of the latter part of the\r\nforegoing scene; and at the same time expressed great concern for the\r\nyoung lady, “who,” she said, “was under the utmost uneasiness at being\r\nprevented from pursuing her journey. She is a sweet pretty creature,”\r\n added she, “and I am certain I have seen her face before. I fancy she\r\nis in love, and running away from her friends. Who knows but some\r\nyoung gentleman or other may be expecting her, with a heart as heavy\r\nas her own?”\r\n\r\nJones fetched a heavy sigh at those words; of which, though Mrs Waters\r\nobserved it, she took no notice while the landlady continued in the\r\nroom; but, after the departure of that good woman, she could not\r\nforbear giving our heroe certain hints on her suspecting some very\r\ndangerous rival in his affections. The aukward behaviour of Mr Jones\r\non this occasion convinced her of the truth, without his giving her a\r\ndirect answer to any of her questions; but she was not nice enough in\r\nher amours to be greatly concerned at the discovery. The beauty of\r\nJones highly charmed her eye; but as she could not see his heart, she\r\ngave herself no concern about it. She could feast heartily at the\r\ntable of love, without reflecting that some other already had been, or\r\nhereafter might be, feasted with the same repast. A sentiment which,\r\nif it deals but little in refinement, deals, however, much in\r\nsubstance; and is less capricious, and perhaps less ill-natured and\r\nselfish, than the desires of those females who can be contented enough\r\nto abstain from the possession of their lovers, provided they are\r\nsufficiently satisfied that no one else possesses them."

      "title": "Chapter vii.",
      "content": "Containing a fuller account of Mrs Waters, and by what means she came\r\ninto that distressful situation from which she was rescued by Jones.\r\n\nThough Nature hath by no means mixed up an equal share either of\r\ncuriosity or vanity in every human composition, there is perhaps no\r\nindividual to whom she hath not allotted such a proportion of both as\r\nrequires much arts, and pains too, to subdue and keep under;--a\r\nconquest, however, absolutely necessary to every one who would in any\r\ndegree deserve the characters of wisdom or good breeding.\r\n\r\nAs Jones, therefore, might very justly be called a well-bred man, he\r\nhad stifled all that curiosity which the extraordinary manner in which\r\nhe had found Mrs Waters must be supposed to have occasioned. He had,\r\nindeed, at first thrown out some few hints to the lady; but, when he\r\nperceived her industriously avoiding any explanation, he was contented\r\nto remain in ignorance, the rather as he was not without suspicion\r\nthat there were some circumstances which must have raised her blushes,\r\nhad she related the whole truth.\r\n\r\nNow since it is possible that some of our readers may not so easily\r\nacquiesce under the same ignorance, and as we are very desirous to\r\nsatisfy them all, we have taken uncommon pains to inform ourselves of\r\nthe real fact, with the relation of which we shall conclude this book.\r\n\r\nThis lady, then, had lived some years with one Captain Waters, who was\r\na captain in the same regiment to which Mr Northerton belonged. She\r\npast for that gentleman's wife, and went by his name; and yet, as the\r\nserjeant said, there were some doubts concerning the reality of their\r\nmarriage, which we shall not at present take upon us to resolve.\r\n\r\nMrs Waters, I am sorry to say it, had for some time contracted an\r\nintimacy with the above-mentioned ensign, which did no great credit to\r\nher reputation. That she had a remarkable fondness for that young\r\nfellow is most certain; but whether she indulged this to any very\r\ncriminal lengths is not so extremely clear, unless we will suppose\r\nthat women never grant every favour to a man but one, without granting\r\nhim that one also.\r\n\r\nThe division of the regiment to which Captain Waters belonged had two\r\ndays preceded the march of that company to which Mr Northerton was the\r\nensign; so that the former had reached Worcester the very day after\r\nthe unfortunate re-encounter between Jones and Northerton which we\r\nhave before recorded.\r\n\r\nNow, it had been agreed between Mrs Waters and the captain that she\r\nwould accompany him in his march as far as Worcester, where they were\r\nto take their leave of each other, and she was thence to return to\r\nBath, where she was to stay till the end of the winter's campaign\r\nagainst the rebels.\r\n\r\nWith this agreement Mr Northerton was made acquainted. To say the\r\ntruth, the lady had made him an assignation at this very place, and\r\npromised to stay at Worcester till his division came thither; with\r\nwhat view, and for what purpose, must be left to the reader's\r\ndivination; for, though we are obliged to relate facts, we are not\r\nobliged to do a violence to our nature by any comments to the\r\ndisadvantage of the loveliest part of the creation.\r\n\r\nNortherton no sooner obtained a release from his captivity, as we have\r\nseen, than he hasted away to overtake Mrs Waters; which, as he was a\r\nvery active nimble fellow, he did at the last-mentioned city, some few\r\nhours after Captain Waters had left her. At his first arrival he made\r\nno scruple of acquainting her with the unfortunate accident; which he\r\nmade appear very unfortunate indeed, for he totally extracted every\r\nparticle of what could be called fault, at least in a court of honour,\r\nthough he left some circumstances which might be questionable in a\r\ncourt of law.\r\n\r\nWomen, to their glory be it spoken, are more generally capable of that\r\nviolent and apparently disinterested passion of love, which seeks only\r\nthe good of its object, than men. Mrs Waters, therefore, was no sooner\r\napprized of the danger to which her lover was exposed, than she lost\r\nevery consideration besides that of his safety; and this being a\r\nmatter equally agreeable to the gentleman, it became the immediate\r\nsubject of debate between them.\r\n\r\nAfter much consultation on this matter, it was at length agreed that\r\nthe ensign should go across the country to Hereford, whence he might\r\nfind some conveyance to one of the sea-ports in Wales, and thence\r\nmight make his escape abroad. In all which expedition Mrs Waters\r\ndeclared she would bear him company; and for which she was able to\r\nfurnish him with money, a very material article to Mr Northerton, she\r\nhaving then in her pocket three bank-notes to the amount of £90,\r\nbesides some cash, and a diamond ring of pretty considerable value on\r\nher finger. All which she, with the utmost confidence, revealed to\r\nthis wicked man, little suspecting she should by these means inspire\r\nhim with a design of robbing her. Now, as they must, by taking horses\r\nfrom Worcester, have furnished any pursuers with the means of\r\nhereafter discovering their route, the ensign proposed, and the lady\r\npresently agreed, to make their first stage on foot; for which purpose\r\nthe hardness of the frost was very seasonable.\r\n\r\nThe main part of the lady's baggage was already at Bath, and she had\r\nnothing with her at present besides a very small quantity of linen,\r\nwhich the gallant undertook to carry in his own pockets. All things,\r\ntherefore, being settled in the evening, they arose early the next\r\nmorning, and at five o'clock departed from Worcester, it being then\r\nabove two hours before day, but the moon, which was then at the full,\r\ngave them all the light she was capable of affording.\r\n\r\nMrs Waters was not of that delicate race of women who are obliged to\r\nthe invention of vehicles for the capacity of removing themselves from\r\none place to another, and with whom consequently a coach is reckoned\r\namong the necessaries of life. Her limbs were indeed full of strength\r\nand agility, and, as her mind was no less animated with spirit, she\r\nwas perfectly able to keep pace with her nimble lover.\r\n\r\nHaving travelled on for some miles in a high road, which Northerton\r\nsaid he was informed led to Hereford, they came at the break of day to\r\nthe side of a large wood, where he suddenly stopped, and, affecting to\r\nmeditate a moment with himself, expressed some apprehensions from\r\ntravelling any longer in so public a way. Upon which he easily\r\npersuaded his fair companion to strike with him into a path which\r\nseemed to lead directly through the wood, and which at length brought\r\nthem both to the bottom of Mazard Hill.\r\n\r\nWhether the execrable scheme which he now attempted to execute was the\r\neffect of previous deliberation, or whether it now first came into his\r\nhead, I cannot determine. But being arrived in this lonely place,\r\nwhere it was very improbable he should meet with any interruption, he\r\nsuddenly slipped his garter from his leg, and, laying violent hands on\r\nthe poor woman, endeavoured to perpetrate that dreadful and detestable\r\nfact which we have before commemorated, and which the providential\r\nappearance of Jones did so fortunately prevent.\r\n\r\nHappy was it for Mrs Waters that she was not of the weakest order of\r\nfemales; for no sooner did she perceive, by his tying a knot in his\r\ngarter, and by his declarations, what his hellish intentions were,\r\nthan she stood stoutly to her defence, and so strongly struggled with\r\nher enemy, screaming all the while for assistance, that she delayed\r\nthe execution of the villain's purpose several minutes, by which means\r\nMr Jones came to her relief at that very instant when her strength\r\nfailed and she was totally overpowered, and delivered her from the\r\nruffian's hands, with no other loss than that of her cloaths, which\r\nwere torn from her back, and of the diamond ring, which during the\r\ncontention either dropped from her finger, or was wrenched from it by\r\nNortherton.\r\n\r\nThus, reader, we have given thee the fruits of a very painful enquiry\r\nwhich for thy satisfaction we have made into this matter. And here we\r\nhave opened to thee a scene of folly as well as villany, which we\r\ncould scarce have believed a human creature capable of being guilty\r\nof, had we not remembered that this fellow was at that time firmly\r\npersuaded that he had already committed a murder, and had forfeited\r\nhis life to the law. As he concluded therefore that his only safety\r\nlay in flight, he thought the possessing himself of this poor woman's\r\nmoney and ring would make him amends for the additional burthen he was\r\nto lay on his conscience.\r\n\r\nAnd here, reader, we must strictly caution thee that thou dost not\r\ntake any occasion, from the misbehaviour of such a wretch as this, to\r\nreflect on so worthy and honourable a body of men as are the officers\r\nof our army in general. Thou wilt be pleased to consider that this\r\nfellow, as we have already informed thee, had neither the birth nor\r\neducation of a gentleman, nor was a proper person to be enrolled among\r\nthe number of such. If, therefore, his baseness can justly reflect on\r\nany besides himself, it must be only on those who gave him his\r\ncommission.\r\n\nBOOK X.\r\n\r\nIN WHICH THE HISTORY GOES FORWARD ABOUT TWELVE HOURS."

      "content": "Containing instructions very necessary to be perused by modern\r\ncritics.\r\n\nReader, it is impossible we should know what sort of person thou wilt\r\nbe; for, perhaps, thou may'st be as learned in human nature as\r\nShakespear himself was, and, perhaps, thou may'st be no wiser than\r\nsome of his editors. Now, lest this latter should be the case, we\r\nthink proper, before we go any farther together, to give thee a few\r\nwholesome admonitions; that thou may'st not as grossly misunderstand\r\nand misrepresent us, as some of the said editors have misunderstood\r\nand misrepresented their author.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, we warn thee not too hastily to condemn any of the\r\nincidents in this our history as impertinent and foreign to our main\r\ndesign, because thou dost not immediately conceive in what manner such\r\nincident may conduce to that design. This work may, indeed, be\r\nconsidered as a great creation of our own; and for a little reptile of\r\na critic to presume to find fault with any of its parts, without\r\nknowing the manner in which the whole is connected, and before he\r\ncomes to the final catastrophe, is a most presumptuous absurdity. The\r\nallusion and metaphor we have here made use of, we must acknowledge to\r\nbe infinitely too great for our occasion; but there is, indeed, no\r\nother, which is at all adequate to express the difference between an\r\nauthor of the first rate and a critic of the lowest.\r\n\r\nAnother caution we would give thee, my good reptile, is, that thou\r\ndost not find out too near a resemblance between certain characters\r\nhere introduced; as, for instance, between the landlady who appears in\r\nthe seventh book and her in the ninth. Thou art to know, friend, that\r\nthere are certain characteristics in which most individuals of every\r\nprofession and occupation agree. To be able to preserve these\r\ncharacteristics, and at the same time to diversify their operations,\r\nis one talent of a good writer. Again, to mark the nice distinction\r\nbetween two persons actuated by the same vice or folly is another;\r\nand, as this last talent is found in very few writers, so is the true\r\ndiscernment of it found in as few readers; though, I believe, the\r\nobservation of this forms a very principal pleasure in those who are\r\ncapable of the discovery; every person, for instance, can distinguish\r\nbetween Sir Epicure Mammon and Sir Fopling Flutter; but to note the\r\ndifference between Sir Fopling Flutter and Sir Courtly Nice requires a\r\nmore exquisite judgment: for want of which, vulgar spectators of plays\r\nvery often do great injustice in the theatre; where I have sometimes\r\nknown a poet in danger of being convicted as a thief, upon much worse\r\nevidence than the resemblance of hands hath been held to be in the\r\nlaw. In reality, I apprehend every amorous widow on the stage would\r\nrun the hazard of being condemned as a servile imitation of Dido, but\r\nthat happily very few of our play-house critics understand enough of\r\nLatin to read Virgil.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, we must admonish thee, my worthy friend (for,\r\nperhaps, thy heart may be better than thy head), not to condemn a\r\ncharacter as a bad one, because it is not perfectly a good one. If\r\nthou dost delight in these models of perfection, there are books enow\r\nwritten to gratify thy taste; but, as we have not, in the course of\r\nour conversation, ever happened to meet with any such person, we have\r\nnot chosen to introduce any such here. To say the truth, I a little\r\nquestion whether mere man ever arrived at this consummate degree of\r\nexcellence, as well as whether there hath ever existed a monster bad\r\nenough to verify that\r\n\r\n _----nulla virtute redemptum\r\n A vitiis_----[*]\r\n\r\n [*] Whose vices are not allayed with a single virtue\r\n\r\nin Juvenal; nor do I, indeed, conceive the good purposes served by\r\ninserting characters of such angelic perfection, or such diabolical\r\ndepravity, in any work of invention; since, from contemplating either,\r\nthe mind of man is more likely to be overwhelmed with sorrow and shame\r\nthan to draw any good uses from such patterns; for in the former\r\ninstance he may be both concerned and ashamed to see a pattern of\r\nexcellence in his nature, which he may reasonably despair of ever\r\narriving at; and in contemplating the latter he may be no less\r\naffected with those uneasy sensations, at seeing the nature of which\r\nhe is a partaker degraded into so odious and detestable a creature.\r\n\r\nIn fact, if there be enough of goodness in a character to engage the\r\nadmiration and affection of a well-disposed mind, though there should\r\nappear some of those little blemishes _quas humana parum cavit\r\nnatura_, they will raise our compassion rather than our abhorrence.\r\nIndeed, nothing can be of more moral use than the imperfections which\r\nare seen in examples of this kind; since such form a kind of surprize,\r\nmore apt to affect and dwell upon our minds than the faults of very\r\nvicious and wicked persons. The foibles and vices of men, in whom\r\nthere is great mixture of good, become more glaring objects from the\r\nvirtues which contrast them and shew their deformity; and when we find\r\nsuch vices attended with their evil consequence to our favourite\r\ncharacters, we are not only taught to shun them for our own sake, but\r\nto hate them for the mischiefs they have already brought on those we\r\nlove.\r\n\r\nAnd now, my friend, having given you these few admonitions, we will,\r\nif you please, once more set forward with our history."

      "content": "Containing the arrival of an Irish gentleman, with very extraordinary\r\nadventures which ensued at the inn.\r\n\nNow the little trembling hare, which the dread of all her numerous\r\nenemies, and chiefly of that cunning, cruel, carnivorous animal, man,\r\nhad confined all the day to her lurking-place, sports wantonly o'er\r\nthe lawns; now on some hollow tree the owl, shrill chorister of the\r\nnight, hoots forth notes which might charm the ears of some modern\r\nconnoisseurs in music; now, in the imagination of the half-drunk\r\nclown, as he staggers through the churchyard, or rather charnelyard,\r\nto his home, fear paints the bloody hobgoblin; now thieves and\r\nruffians are awake, and honest watchmen fast asleep; in plain English,\r\nit was now midnight; and the company at the inn, as well those who\r\nhave been already mentioned in this history, as some others who\r\narrived in the evening, were all in bed. Only Susan Chambermaid was\r\nnow stirring, she being obliged to wash the kitchen before she retired\r\nto the arms of the fond expecting hostler.\r\n\r\nIn this posture were affairs at the inn when a gentleman arrived there\r\npost. He immediately alighted from his horse, and, coming up to Susan,\r\nenquired of her, in a very abrupt and confused manner, being almost\r\nout of breath with eagerness, Whether there was any lady in the house?\r\nThe hour of night, and the behaviour of the man, who stared very\r\nwildly all the time, a little surprized Susan, so that she hesitated\r\nbefore she made any answer; upon which the gentleman, with redoubled\r\neagerness, begged her to give him a true information, saying, He had\r\nlost his wife, and was come in pursuit of her. “Upon my shoul,” cries\r\nhe, “I have been near catching her already in two or three places, if\r\nI had not found her gone just as I came up with her. If she be in the\r\nhouse, do carry me up in the dark and show her to me; and if she be\r\ngone away before me, do tell me which way I shall go after her to meet\r\nher, and, upon my shoul, I will make you the richest poor woman in the\r\nnation.” He then pulled out a handful of guineas, a sight which would\r\nhave bribed persons of much greater consequence than this poor wench\r\nto much worse purposes.\r\n\r\nSusan, from the account she had received of Mrs Waters, made not the\r\nleast doubt but that she was the very identical stray whom the right\r\nowner pursued. As she concluded, therefore, with great appearance of\r\nreason, that she never could get money in an honester way than by\r\nrestoring a wife to her husband, she made no scruple of assuring the\r\ngentleman that the lady he wanted was then in the house; and was\r\npresently afterwards prevailed upon (by very liberal promises, and\r\nsome earnest paid into her hands) to conduct him to the bedchamber of\r\nMrs Waters.\r\n\r\nIt hath been a custom long established in the polite world, and that\r\nupon very solid and substantial reasons, that a husband shall never\r\nenter his wife's apartment without first knocking at the door. The\r\nmany excellent uses of this custom need scarce be hinted to a reader\r\nwho hath any knowledge of the world; for by this means the lady hath\r\ntime to adjust herself, or to remove any disagreeable object out of\r\nthe way; for there are some situations in which nice and delicate\r\nwomen would not be discovered by their husbands.\r\n\r\nTo say the truth, there are several ceremonies instituted among the\r\npolished part of mankind, which, though they may, to coarser\r\njudgments, appear as matters of mere form, are found to have much of\r\nsubstance in them, by the more discerning; and lucky would it have\r\nbeen had the custom above mentioned been observed by our gentleman in\r\nthe present instance. Knock, indeed, he did at the door, but not with\r\none of those gentle raps which is usual on such occasions. On the\r\ncontrary, when he found the door locked, he flew at it with such\r\nviolence, that the lock immediately gave way, the door burst open, and\r\nhe fell headlong into the room.\r\n\r\nHe had no sooner recovered his legs than forth from the bed, upon his\r\nlegs likewise, appeared--with shame and sorrow are we obliged to\r\nproceed--our heroe himself, who, with a menacing voice, demanded of\r\nthe gentleman who he was, and what he meant by daring to burst open\r\nhis chamber in that outrageous manner.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman at first thought he had committed a mistake, and was\r\ngoing to ask pardon and retreat, when, on a sudden, as the moon shone\r\nvery bright, he cast his eyes on stays, gowns, petticoats, caps,\r\nribbons, stockings, garters, shoes, clogs, &c., all which lay in a\r\ndisordered manner on the floor. All these, operating on the natural\r\njealousy of his temper, so enraged him, that he lost all power of\r\nspeech; and, without returning any answer to Jones, he endeavoured to\r\napproach the bed.\r\n\r\nJones immediately interposing, a fierce contention arose, which soon\r\nproceeded to blows on both sides. And now Mrs Waters (for we must\r\nconfess she was in the same bed), being, I suppose, awakened from her\r\nsleep, and seeing two men fighting in her bedchamber, began to scream\r\nin the most violent manner, crying out murder! robbery! and more\r\nfrequently rape! which last, some, perhaps, may wonder she should\r\nmention, who do not consider that these words of exclamation are used\r\nby ladies in a fright, as fa, la, la, ra, da, &c., are in music, only\r\nas the vehicles of sound, and without any fixed ideas.\r\n\r\nNext to the lady's chamber was deposited the body of an Irish\r\ngentleman who arrived too late at the inn to have been mentioned\r\nbefore. This gentleman was one of those whom the Irish call a\r\ncalabalaro, or cavalier. He was a younger brother of a good family,\r\nand, having no fortune at home, was obliged to look abroad in order to\r\nget one; for which purpose he was proceeding to the Bath, to try his\r\nluck with cards and the women.\r\n\r\nThis young fellow lay in bed reading one of Mrs Behn's novels; for he\r\nhad been instructed by a friend that he would find no more effectual\r\nmethod of recommending himself to the ladies than the improving his\r\nunderstanding, and filling his mind with good literature. He no\r\nsooner, therefore, heard the violent uproar in the next room, than he\r\nleapt from his bolster, and, taking his sword in one hand, and the\r\ncandle which burnt by him in the other, he went directly to Mrs\r\nWaters's chamber.\r\n\r\nIf the sight of another man in his shirt at first added some shock to\r\nthe decency of the lady, it made her presently amends by considerably\r\nabating her fears; for no sooner had the calabalaro entered the room\r\nthan he cried out, “Mr Fitzpatrick, what the devil is the maning of\r\nthis?” Upon which the other immediately answered, “O, Mr Maclachlan! I\r\nam rejoiced you are here.--This villain hath debauched my wife, and is\r\ngot into bed with her.”--“What wife?” cries Maclachlan; “do not I know\r\nMrs Fitzpatrick very well, and don't I see that the lady, whom the\r\ngentleman who stands here in his shirt is lying in bed with, is none\r\nof her?”\r\n\r\nFitzpatrick, now perceiving, as well by the glimpse he had of the\r\nlady, as by her voice, which might have been distinguished at a\r\ngreater distance than he now stood from her, that he had made a very\r\nunfortunate mistake, began to ask many pardons of the lady; and then,\r\nturning to Jones, he said, “I would have you take notice I do not ask\r\nyour pardon, for you have bate me; for which I am resolved to have\r\nyour blood in the morning.”\r\n\r\nJones treated this menace with much contempt; and Mr Maclachlan\r\nanswered, “Indeed, Mr Fitzpatrick, you may be ashamed of your own\r\nself, to disturb people at this time of night; if all the people in\r\nthe inn were not asleep, you would have awakened them as you have me.\r\nThe gentleman has served you very rightly. Upon my conscience, though\r\nI have no wife, if you had treated her so, I would have cut your\r\nthroat.”\r\n\r\nJones was so confounded with his fears for his lady's reputation, that\r\nhe knew neither what to say or do; but the invention of women is, as\r\nhath been observed, much readier than that of men. She recollected\r\nthat there was a communication between her chamber and that of Mr\r\nJones; relying, therefore, on his honour and her own assurance, she\r\nanswered, “I know not what you mean, villains! I am wife to none of\r\nyou. Help! Rape! Murder! Rape!”--And now, the landlady coming into the\r\nroom, Mrs Waters fell upon her with the utmost virulence, saying, “She\r\nthought herself in a sober inn, and not in a bawdy-house; but that a\r\nset of villains had broke into her room, with an intent upon her\r\nhonour, if not upon her life; and both, she said, were equally dear to\r\nher.”\r\n\r\nThe landlady now began to roar as loudly as the poor woman in bed had\r\ndone before. She cried, “She was undone, and that the reputation of\r\nher house, which was never blown upon before, was utterly destroyed.”\r\n Then, turning to the men, she cried, “What, in the devil's name, is\r\nthe reason of all this disturbance in the lady's room?” Fitzpatrick,\r\nhanging down his head, repeated, “That he had committed a mistake, for\r\nwhich he heartily asked pardon,” and then retired with his countryman.\r\nJones, who was too ingenious to have missed the hint given him by his\r\nfair one, boldly asserted, “That he had run to her assistance upon\r\nhearing the door broke open, with what design he could not conceive,\r\nunless of robbing the lady; which, if they intended, he said, he had\r\nthe good fortune to prevent.” “I never had a robbery committed in my\r\nhouse since I have kept it,” cries the landlady; “I would have you to\r\nknow, sir, I harbour no highwaymen here; I scorn the word, thof I say\r\nit. None but honest, good gentlefolks, are welcome to my house; and, I\r\nthank good luck, I have always had enow of such customers; indeed as\r\nmany as I could entertain. Here hath been my lord--,” and then she\r\nrepeated over a catalogue of names and titles, many of which we might,\r\nperhaps, be guilty of a breach of privilege by inserting.\r\n\r\nJones, after much patience, at length interrupted her, by making an\r\napology to Mrs Waters, for having appeared before her in his shirt,\r\nassuring her “That nothing but a concern for her safety could have\r\nprevailed on him to do it.” The reader may inform himself of her\r\nanswer, and, indeed, of her whole behaviour to the end of the scene,\r\nby considering the situation which she affected, it being that of a\r\nmodest lady, who was awakened out of her sleep by three strange men in\r\nher chamber. This was the part which she undertook to perform; and,\r\nindeed, she executed it so well, that none of our theatrical actresses\r\ncould exceed her, in any of their performances, either on or off the\r\nstage.\r\n\r\nAnd hence, I think, we may very fairly draw an argument, to prove how\r\nextremely natural virtue is to the fair sex; for, though there is not,\r\nperhaps, one in ten thousand who is capable of making a good actress,\r\nand even among these we rarely see two who are equally able to\r\npersonate the same character, yet this of virtue they can all\r\nadmirably well put on; and as well those individuals who have it not,\r\nas those who possess it, can all act it to the utmost degree of\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nWhen the men were all departed, Mrs Waters, recovering from her fear,\r\nrecovered likewise from her anger, and spoke in much gentler accents\r\nto the landlady, who did not so readily quit her concern for the\r\nreputation of the house, in favour of which she began again to number\r\nthe many great persons who had slept under her roof; but the lady\r\nstopt her short, and having absolutely acquitted her of having had any\r\nshare in the past disturbance, begged to be left to her repose, which,\r\nshe said, she hoped to enjoy unmolested during the remainder of the\r\nnight. Upon which the landlady, after much civility and many\r\ncourtsies, took her leave."

      "content": "A dialogue between the landlady and Susan the chamber-maid, proper to\r\nbe read by all inn-keepers and their servants; with the arrival, and\r\naffable behaviour of a beautiful young lady; which may teach persons\r\nof condition how they may acquire the love of the whole world.\r\n\nThe landlady, remembering that Susan had been the only person out of\r\nbed when the door was burst open, resorted presently to her, to\r\nenquire into the first occasion of the disturbance, as well as who the\r\nstrange gentleman was, and when and how he arrived.\r\n\r\nSusan related the whole story which the reader knows already, varying\r\nthe truth only in some circumstances, as she saw convenient, and\r\ntotally concealing the money which she had received. But whereas her\r\nmistress had, in the preface to her enquiry, spoken much in compassion\r\nfor the fright which the lady had been in concerning any intended\r\ndepredations on her virtue, Susan could not help endeavouring to quiet\r\nthe concern which her mistress seemed to be under on that account, by\r\nswearing heartily she saw Jones leap out from her bed.\r\n\r\nThe landlady fell into a violent rage at these words. “A likely story,\r\ntruly,” cried she, “that a woman should cry out, and endeavour to\r\nexpose herself, if that was the case! I desire to know what better\r\nproof any lady can give of her virtue than her crying out, which, I\r\nbelieve, twenty people can witness for her she did? I beg, madam, you\r\nwould spread no such scandal of any of my guests; for it will not only\r\nreflect on them, but upon the house; and I am sure no vagabonds, nor\r\nwicked beggarly people, come here.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” says Susan, “then I must not believe my own eyes.” “No,\r\nindeed, must you not always,” answered her mistress; “I would not have\r\nbelieved my own eyes against such good gentlefolks. I have not had a\r\nbetter supper ordered this half-year than they ordered last night; and\r\nso easy and good-humoured were they, that they found no fault with my\r\nWorcestershire perry, which I sold them for champagne; and to be sure\r\nit is as well tasted and as wholesome as the best champagne in the\r\nkingdom, otherwise I would scorn to give it 'em; and they drank me two\r\nbottles. No, no, I will never believe any harm of such sober good sort\r\nof people.”\r\n\r\nSusan being thus silenced, her mistress proceeded to other matters.\r\n“And so you tell me,” continued she, “that the strange gentleman came\r\npost, and there is a footman without with the horses; why, then, he is\r\ncertainly some of your great gentlefolks too. Why did not you ask him\r\nwhether he'd have any supper? I think he is in the other gentleman's\r\nroom; go up and ask whether he called. Perhaps he'll order something\r\nwhen he finds anybody stirring in the house to dress it. Now don't\r\ncommit any of your usual blunders, by telling him the fire's out, and\r\nthe fowls alive. And if he should order mutton, don't blab out that we\r\nhave none. The butcher, I know, killed a sheep just before I went to\r\nbed, and he never refuses to cut it up warm when I desire it. Go,\r\nremember there's all sorts of mutton and fowls; go, open the door\r\nwith, Gentlemen, d'ye call? and if they say nothing, ask what his\r\nhonour will be pleased to have for supper? Don't forget his honour.\r\nGo; if you don't mind all these matters better, you'll never come to\r\nanything.”\r\n\r\nSusan departed, and soon returned with an account that the two\r\ngentlemen were got both into the same bed. “Two gentlemen,” says the\r\nlandlady, “in the same bed! that's impossible; they are two arrant\r\nscrubs, I warrant them; and I believe young Squire Allworthy guessed\r\nright, that the fellow intended to rob her ladyship; for, if he had\r\nbroke open the lady's door with any of the wicked designs of a\r\ngentleman, he would never have sneaked away to another room to save\r\nthe expense of a supper and a bed to himself. They are certainly\r\nthieves, and their searching after a wife is nothing but a pretence.”\r\n\r\nIn these censures my landlady did Mr Fitzpatrick great injustice; for\r\nhe was really born a gentleman, though not worth a groat; and though,\r\nperhaps, he had some few blemishes in his heart as well as in his\r\nhead, yet being a sneaking or a niggardly fellow was not one of them.\r\nIn reality, he was so generous a man, that, whereas he had received a\r\nvery handsome fortune with his wife, he had now spent every penny of\r\nit, except some little pittance which was settled upon her; and, in\r\norder to possess himself of this, he had used her with such cruelty,\r\nthat, together with his jealousy, which was of the bitterest kind, it\r\nhad forced the poor woman to run away from him.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman then being well tired with his long journey from\r\nChester in one day, with which, and some good dry blows he had\r\nreceived in the scuffle, his bones were so sore, that, added to the\r\nsoreness of his mind, it had quite deprived him of any appetite for\r\neating. And being now so violently disappointed in the woman whom, at\r\nthe maid's instance, he had mistaken for his wife, it never once\r\nentered into his head that she might nevertheless be in the house,\r\nthough he had erred in the first person he had attacked. He therefore\r\nyielded to the dissuasions of his friend from searching any farther\r\nafter her that night, and accepted the kind offer of part of his bed.\r\n\r\nThe footman and post-boy were in a different disposition. They were\r\nmore ready to order than the landlady was to provide; however, after\r\nbeing pretty well satisfied by them of the real truth of the case, and\r\nthat Mr Fitzpatrick was no thief, she was at length prevailed on to\r\nset some cold meat before them, which they were devouring with great\r\ngreediness, when Partridge came into the kitchen. He had been first\r\nawaked by the hurry which we have before seen; and while he was\r\nendeavouring to compose himself again on his pillow, a screech-owl had\r\ngiven him such a serenade at his window, that he leapt in a most\r\nhorrible affright from his bed, and, huddling on his cloaths with\r\ngreat expedition, ran down to the protection of the company, whom he\r\nheard talking below in the kitchen.\r\n\r\nHis arrival detained my landlady from returning to her rest; for she\r\nwas just about to leave the other two guests to the care of Susan; but\r\nthe friend of young Squire Allworthy was not to be so neglected,\r\nespecially as he called for a pint of wine to be mulled. She\r\nimmediately obeyed, by putting the same quantity of perry to the fire;\r\nfor this readily answered to the name of every kind of wine.\r\n\r\nThe Irish footman was retired to bed, and the post-boy was going to\r\nfollow; but Partridge invited him to stay and partake of his wine,\r\nwhich the lad very thankfully accepted. The schoolmaster was indeed\r\nafraid to return to bed by himself; and as he did not know how soon he\r\nmight lose the company of my landlady, he was resolved to secure that\r\nof the boy, in whose presence he apprehended no danger from the devil\r\nor any of his adherents.\r\n\r\nAnd now arrived another post-boy at the gate; upon which Susan, being\r\nordered out, returned, introducing two young women in riding habits,\r\none of which was so very richly laced, that Partridge and the post-boy\r\ninstantly started from their chairs, and my landlady fell to her\r\ncourtsies, and her ladyships, with great eagerness.\r\n\r\nThe lady in the rich habit said, with a smile of great condescension,\r\n“If you will give me leave, madam, I will warm myself a few minutes at\r\nyour kitchen fire, for it is really very cold; but I must insist on\r\ndisturbing no one from his seat.” This was spoken on account of\r\nPartridge, who had retreated to the other end of the room, struck with\r\nthe utmost awe and astonishment at the splendor of the lady's dress.\r\nIndeed, she had a much better title to respect than this; for she was\r\none of the most beautiful creatures in the world.\r\n\r\nThe lady earnestly desired Partridge to return to his seat; but could\r\nnot prevail. She then pulled off her gloves, and displayed to the fire\r\ntwo hands, which had every property of snow in them, except that of\r\nmelting. Her companion, who was indeed her maid, likewise pulled off\r\nher gloves, and discovered what bore an exact resemblance, in cold and\r\ncolour, to a piece of frozen beef.\r\n\r\n“I wish, madam,” quoth the latter, “your ladyship would not think of\r\ngoing any farther to-night. I am terribly afraid your ladyship will\r\nnot be able to bear the fatigue.”\r\n\r\n“Why sure,” cries the landlady, “her ladyship's honour can never\r\nintend it. O, bless me! farther to-night, indeed! let me beseech your\r\nladyship not to think on't----But, to be sure, your ladyship can't.\r\nWhat will your honour be pleased to have for supper? I have mutton of\r\nall kinds, and some nice chicken.”\r\n\r\n“I think, madam,” said the lady, “it would be rather breakfast than\r\nsupper; but I can't eat anything; and, if I stay, shall only lie down\r\nfor an hour or two. However, if you please, madam, you may get me a\r\nlittle sack whey, made very small and thin.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, madam,” cries the mistress of the house, “I have some excellent\r\nwhite wine.”--“You have no sack, then?” says the lady. “Yes, an't\r\nplease your honour, I have; I may challenge the country for that--but\r\nlet me beg your ladyship to eat something.”\r\n\r\n“Upon my word, I can't eat a morsel,” answered the lady; “and I shall\r\nbe much obliged to you if you will please to get my apartment ready as\r\nsoon as possible; for I am resolved to be on horseback again in three\r\nhours.”\r\n\r\n“Why, Susan,” cries the landlady, “is there a fire lit yet in the\r\nWild-goose? I am sorry, madam, all my best rooms are full. Several\r\npeople of the first quality are now in bed. Here's a great young\r\nsquire, and many other great gentlefolks of quality.” Susan answered,\r\n“That the Irish gentlemen were got into the Wild-goose.”\r\n\r\n“Was ever anything like it?” says the mistress; “why the devil would\r\nyou not keep some of the best rooms for the quality, when you know\r\nscarce a day passes without some calling here?----If they be\r\ngentlemen, I am certain, when they know it is for her ladyship, they\r\nwill get up again.”\r\n\r\n“Not upon my account,” says the lady; “I will have no person disturbed\r\nfor me. If you have a room that is commonly decent, it will serve me\r\nvery well, though it be never so plain. I beg, madam, you will not\r\ngive yourself so much trouble on my account.” “O, madam!” cries the\r\nother, “I have several very good rooms for that matter, but none good\r\nenough for your honour's ladyship. However, as you are so\r\ncondescending to take up with the best I have, do, Susan, get a fire\r\nin the Rose this minute. Will your ladyship be pleased to go up now,\r\nor stay till the fire is lighted?” “I think I have sufficiently warmed\r\nmyself,” answered the lady; “so, if you please, I will go now; I am\r\nafraid I have kept people, and particularly that gentleman (meaning\r\nPartridge), too long in the cold already. Indeed, I cannot bear to\r\nthink of keeping any person from the fire this dreadful weather.”--She\r\nthen departed with her maid, the landlady marching with two lighted\r\ncandles before her.\r\n\r\nWhen that good woman returned, the conversation in the kitchen was all\r\nupon the charms of the young lady. There is indeed in perfect beauty a\r\npower which none almost can withstand; for my landlady, though she was\r\nnot pleased at the negative given to the supper, declared she had\r\nnever seen so lovely a creature. Partridge ran out into the most\r\nextravagant encomiums on her face, though he could not refrain from\r\npaying some compliments to the gold lace on her habit; the post-boy\r\nsung forth the praises of her goodness, which were likewise echoed by\r\nthe other post-boy, who was now come in. “She's a true good lady, I\r\nwarrant her,” says he; “for she hath mercy upon dumb creatures; for\r\nshe asked me every now and tan upon the journey, if I did not think\r\nshe should hurt the horses by riding too fast? and when she came in\r\nshe charged me to give them as much corn as ever they would eat.”\r\n\r\nSuch charms are there in affability, and so sure is it to attract the\r\npraises of all kinds of people. It may indeed be compared to the\r\ncelebrated Mrs Hussey.[*] It is equally sure to set off every female\r\nperfection to the highest advantage, and to palliate and conceal every\r\ndefect. A short reflection, which we could not forbear making in this\r\nplace, where my reader hath seen the loveliness of an affable\r\ndeportment; and truth will now oblige us to contrast it, by showing\r\nthe reverse.\r\n\r\n [*] A celebrated mantua-maker in the Strand, famous for setting off\r\n the shapes of women."

      "content": "Containing infallible nostrums for procuring universal disesteem and\r\nhatred.\r\n\nThe lady had no sooner laid herself on her pillow than the\r\nwaiting-woman returned to the kitchen to regale with some of those\r\ndainties which her mistress had refused.\r\n\r\nThe company, at her entrance, shewed her the same respect which they\r\nhad before paid to her mistress, by rising; but she forgot to imitate\r\nher, by desiring them to sit down again. Indeed, it was scarce\r\npossible they should have done so, for she placed her chair in such a\r\nposture as to occupy almost the whole fire. She then ordered a chicken\r\nto be broiled that instant, declaring, if it was not ready in a\r\nquarter of an hour, she would not stay for it. Now, though the said\r\nchicken was then at roost in the stable, and required the several\r\nceremonies of catching, killing, and picking, before it was brought to\r\nthe gridiron, my landlady would nevertheless have undertaken to do all\r\nwithin the time; but the guest, being unfortunately admitted behind\r\nthe scenes, must have been witness to the _fourberie_; the poor woman\r\nwas therefore obliged to confess that she had none in the house; “but,\r\nmadam,” said she, “I can get any kind of mutton in an instant from the\r\nbutcher's.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think, then,” answered the waiting-gentlewoman, “that I have\r\nthe stomach of a horse, to eat mutton at this time of night? Sure you\r\npeople that keep inns imagine your betters are like yourselves.\r\nIndeed, I expected to get nothing at this wretched place. I wonder my\r\nlady would stop at it. I suppose none but tradesmen and grasiers ever\r\ncall here.” The landlady fired at this indignity offered to her house;\r\nhowever, she suppressed her temper, and contented herself with saying,\r\n“Very good quality frequented it, she thanked heaven!” “Don't tell\r\nme,” cries the other, “of quality! I believe I know more of people of\r\nquality than such as you.--But, prithee, without troubling me with any\r\nof your impertinence, do tell me what I can have for supper; for,\r\nthough I cannot eat horse-flesh, I am really hungry.” “Why, truly,\r\nmadam,” answered the landlady, “you could not take me again at such a\r\ndisadvantage; for I must confess I have nothing in the house, unless a\r\ncold piece of beef, which indeed a gentleman's footman and the\r\npost-boy have almost cleared to the bone.” “Woman,” said Mrs Abigail\r\n(so for shortness we will call her), “I entreat you not to make me\r\nsick. If I had fasted a month, I could not eat what had been touched\r\nby the fingers of such fellows. Is there nothing neat or decent to be\r\nhad in this horrid place?” “What think you of some eggs and bacon,\r\nmadam?” said the landlady. “Are your eggs new laid? are you certain\r\nthey were laid to-day? and let me have the bacon cut very nice and\r\nthin; for I can't endure anything that's gross.--Prithee try if you\r\ncan do a little tolerably for once, and don't think you have a\r\nfarmer's wife, or some of those creatures, in the house.”--The\r\nlandlady began then to handle her knife; but the other stopt her,\r\nsaying, “Good woman, I must insist upon your first washing your hands;\r\nfor I am extremely nice, and have been always used from my cradle to\r\nhave everything in the most elegant manner.”\r\n\r\nThe landlady, who governed herself with much difficulty, began now the\r\nnecessary preparations; for as to Susan, she was utterly rejected, and\r\nwith such disdain, that the poor wench was as hard put to it to\r\nrestrain her hands from violence as her mistress had been to hold her\r\ntongue. This indeed Susan did not entirely; for, though she literally\r\nkept it within her teeth, yet there it muttered many “marry-come-ups,\r\nas good flesh and blood as yourself;” with other such indignant\r\nphrases.\r\n\r\nWhile the supper was preparing, Mrs Abigail began to lament she had\r\nnot ordered a fire in the parlour; but, she said, that was now too\r\nlate. “However,” said she, “I have novelty to recommend a kitchen; for\r\nI do not believe I ever eat in one before.” Then, turning to the\r\npost-boys, she asked them, “Why they were not in the stable with their\r\nhorses? If I must eat my hard fare here, madam,” cries she to the\r\nlandlady, “I beg the kitchen may be kept clear, that I may not be\r\nsurrounded with all the blackguards in town: as for you, sir,” says\r\nshe to Partridge, “you look somewhat like a gentleman, and may sit\r\nstill if you please; I don't desire to disturb anybody but mob.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, madam,” cries Partridge, “I am a gentleman, I do assure\r\nyou, and I am not so easily to be disturbed. _Non semper vox casualis\r\nest verbo nominativus_.” This Latin she took to be some affront, and\r\nanswered, “You may be a gentleman, sir; but you don't show yourself as\r\none to talk Latin to a woman.” Partridge made a gentle reply, and\r\nconcluded with more Latin; upon which she tossed up her nose, and\r\ncontented herself by abusing him with the name of a great scholar.\r\n\r\nThe supper being now on the table, Mrs Abigail eat very heartily for\r\nso delicate a person; and, while a second course of the same was by\r\nher order preparing, she said, “And so, madam, you tell me your house\r\nis frequented by people of great quality?”\r\n\r\nThe landlady answered in the affirmative, saying, “There were a great\r\nmany very good quality and gentlefolks in it now. There's young Squire\r\nAllworthy, as that gentleman there knows.”\r\n\r\n“And pray who is this young gentleman of quality, this young Squire\r\nAllworthy?” said Abigail.\r\n\r\n“Who should he be,” answered Partridge, “but the son and heir of the\r\ngreat Squire Allworthy, of Somersetshire!”\r\n\r\n“Upon my word,” said she, “you tell me strange news; for I know Mr\r\nAllworthy of Somersetshire very well, and I know he hath no son\r\nalive.”\r\n\r\nThe landlady pricked up her ears at this, and Partridge looked a\r\nlittle confounded. However, after a short hesitation, he answered,\r\n“Indeed, madam, it is true, everybody doth not know him to be Squire\r\nAllworthy's son; for he was never married to his mother; but his son\r\nhe certainly is, and will be his heir too, as certainly as his name is\r\nJones.” At that word, Abigail let drop the bacon which she was\r\nconveying to her mouth, and cried out, “You surprize me, sir! Is it\r\npossible Mr Jones should be now in the house?” “_Quare non?_” answered\r\nPartridge, “it is possible, and it is certain.”\r\n\r\nAbigail now made haste to finish the remainder of her meal, and then\r\nrepaired back to her mistress, when the conversation passed which may\r\nbe read in the next chapter."

      "content": "Showing who the amiable lady, and her unamiable maid, were.\r\n\nAs in the month of June, the damask rose, which chance hath planted\r\namong the lilies, with their candid hue mixes his vermilion; or as\r\nsome playsome heifer in the pleasant month of May diffuses her\r\nodoriferous breath over the flowery meadows; or as, in the blooming\r\nmonth of April, the gentle, constant dove, perched on some fair bough,\r\nsits meditating on her mate; so, looking a hundred charms and\r\nbreathing as many sweets, her thoughts being fixed on her Tommy, with\r\na heart as good and innocent as her face was beautiful, Sophia (for it\r\nwas she herself) lay reclining her lovely head on her hand, when her\r\nmaid entered the room, and, running directly to the bed, cried,\r\n“Madam--madam--who doth your ladyship think is in the house?” Sophia,\r\nstarting up, cried, “I hope my father hath not overtaken us.” “No,\r\nmadam, it is one worth a hundred fathers; Mr Jones himself is here at\r\nthis very instant.” “Mr Jones!” says Sophia, “it is impossible! I\r\ncannot be so fortunate.” Her maid averred the fact, and was presently\r\ndetached by her mistress to order him to be called; for she said she\r\nwas resolved to see him immediately.\r\n\r\nMrs Honour had no sooner left the kitchen in the manner we have before\r\nseen than the landlady fell severely upon her. The poor woman had\r\nindeed been loading her heart with foul language for some time, and\r\nnow it scoured out of her mouth, as filth doth from a mud-cart, when\r\nthe board which confines it is removed. Partridge likewise shovelled\r\nin his share of calumny, and (what may surprize the reader) not only\r\nbespattered the maid, but attempted to sully the lily-white character\r\nof Sophia herself. “Never a barrel the better herring,” cries he,\r\n“_Noscitur a socio_, is a true saying. It must be confessed, indeed,\r\nthat the lady in the fine garments is the civiller of the two; but I\r\nwarrant neither of them are a bit better than they should be. A couple\r\nof Bath trulls, I'll answer for them; your quality don't ride about at\r\nthis time o' night without servants.” “Sbodlikins, and that's true,”\r\n cries the landlady, “you have certainly hit upon the very matter; for\r\nquality don't come into a house without bespeaking a supper, whether\r\nthey eat or no.”\r\n\r\nWhile they were thus discoursing, Mrs Honour returned and discharged\r\nher commission, by bidding the landlady immediately wake Mr Jones, and\r\ntell him a lady wanted to speak with him. The landlady referred her to\r\nPartridge, saying, “he was the squire's friend: but, for her part, she\r\nnever called men-folks, especially gentlemen,” and then walked\r\nsullenly out of the kitchen. Honour applied herself to Partridge; but\r\nhe refused, “for my friend,” cries he, “went to bed very late, and he\r\nwould be very angry to be disturbed so soon.” Mrs Honour insisted\r\nstill to have him called, saying, “she was sure, instead of being\r\nangry, that he would be to the highest degree delighted when he knew\r\nthe occasion.” “Another time, perhaps, he might,” cries Partridge;\r\n“but _non omnia possumus omnes_. One woman is enough at once for a\r\nreasonable man.” “What do you mean by one woman, fellow?” cries\r\nHonour. “None of your fellow,” answered Partridge. He then proceeded\r\nto inform her plainly that Jones was in bed with a wench, and made use\r\nof an expression too indelicate to be here inserted; which so enraged\r\nMrs Honour, that she called him jackanapes, and returned in a violent\r\nhurry to her mistress, whom she acquainted with the success of her\r\nerrand, and with the account she had received; which, if possible, she\r\nexaggerated, being as angry with Jones as if he had pronounced all the\r\nwords that came from the mouth of Partridge. She discharged a torrent\r\nof abuse on the master, and advised her mistress to quit all thoughts\r\nof a man who had never shown himself deserving of her. She then ripped\r\nup the story of Molly Seagrim, and gave the most malicious turn to his\r\nformerly quitting Sophia herself; which, I must confess, the present\r\nincident not a little countenanced.\r\n\r\nThe spirits of Sophia were too much dissipated by concern to enable\r\nher to stop the torrent of her maid. At last, however, she interrupted\r\nher, saying, “I never can believe this; some villain hath belied him.\r\nYou say you had it from his friend; but surely it is not the office of\r\na friend to betray such secrets.” “I suppose,” cries Honour, “the\r\nfellow is his pimp; for I never saw so ill-looked a villain. Besides,\r\nsuch profligate rakes as Mr Jones are never ashamed of these matters.”\r\n\r\nTo say the truth, this behaviour of Partridge was a little\r\ninexcusable; but he had not slept off the effect of the dose which he\r\nswallowed the evening before; which had, in the morning, received the\r\naddition of above a pint of wine, or indeed rather of malt spirits;\r\nfor the perry was by no means pure. Now, that part of his head which\r\nNature designed for the reservoir of drink being very shallow, a small\r\nquantity of liquor overflowed it, and opened the sluices of his heart;\r\nso that all the secrets there deposited run out. These sluices were\r\nindeed, naturally, very ill-secured. To give the best-natured turn we\r\ncan to his disposition, he was a very honest man; for, as he was the\r\nmost inquisitive of mortals, and eternally prying into the secrets of\r\nothers, so he very faithfully paid them by communicating, in return,\r\neverything within his knowledge.\r\n\r\nWhile Sophia, tormented with anxiety, knew not what to believe, nor\r\nwhat resolution to take, Susan arrived with the sack-whey. Mrs Honour\r\nimmediately advised her mistress, in a whisper, to pump this wench,\r\nwho probably could inform her of the truth. Sophia approved it, and\r\nbegan as follows: “Come hither, child; now answer me truly what I am\r\ngoing to ask you, and I promise you I will very well reward you. Is\r\nthere a young gentleman in this house, a handsome young gentleman,\r\nthat----.” Here Sophia blushed and was confounded. “A young\r\ngentleman,” cries Honour, “that came hither in company with that saucy\r\nrascal who is now in the kitchen?” Susan answered, “There was.”--“Do\r\nyou know anything of any lady?” continues Sophia, “any lady? I don't\r\nask you whether she is handsome or no; perhaps she is not; that's\r\nnothing to the purpose; but do you know of any lady?” “La, madam,”\r\n cries Honour, “you will make a very bad examiner. Hark'ee, child,”\r\n says she, “is not that very young gentleman now in bed with some nasty\r\ntrull or other?” Here Susan smiled, and was silent. “Answer the\r\nquestion, child,” says Sophia, “and here's a guinea for you.”--“A\r\nguinea! madam,” cries Susan; “la, what's a guinea? If my mistress\r\nshould know it I shall certainly lose my place that very instant.”\r\n “Here's another for you,” says Sophia, “and I promise you faithfully\r\nyour mistress shall never know it.” Susan, after a very short\r\nhesitation, took the money, and told the whole story, concluding with\r\nsaying, “If you have any great curiosity, madam, I can steal softly\r\ninto his room, and see whether he be in his own bed or no.” She\r\naccordingly did this by Sophia's desire, and returned with an answer\r\nin the negative.\r\n\r\nSophia now trembled and turned pale. Mrs Honour begged her to be\r\ncomforted, and not to think any more of so worthless a fellow. “Why\r\nthere,” says Susan, “I hope, madam, your ladyship won't be offended;\r\nbut pray, madam, is not your ladyship's name Madam Sophia Western?”\r\n “How is it possible you should know me?” answered Sophia. “Why that\r\nman, that the gentlewoman spoke of, who is in the kitchen, told about\r\nyou last night. But I hope your ladyship is not angry with me.”\r\n “Indeed, child,” said she, “I am not; pray tell me all, and I promise\r\nyou I'll reward you.” “Why, madam,” continued Susan, “that man told us\r\nall in the kitchen that Madam Sophia Western--indeed I don't know how\r\nto bring it out.”--Here she stopt, till, having received encouragement\r\nfrom Sophia, and being vehemently pressed by Mrs Honour, she proceeded\r\nthus:--“He told us, madam, though to be sure it is all a lie, that\r\nyour ladyship was dying for love of the young squire, and that he was\r\ngoing to the wars to get rid of you. I thought to myself then he was a\r\nfalse-hearted wretch; but, now, to see such a fine, rich, beautiful\r\nlady as you be, forsaken for such an ordinary woman; for to be sure so\r\nshe is, and another man's wife into the bargain. It is such a strange\r\nunnatural thing, in a manner.”\r\n\r\nSophia gave her a third guinea, and, telling her she would certainly\r\nbe her friend if she mentioned nothing of what had passed, nor\r\ninformed any one who she was, dismissed the girl, with orders to the\r\npost-boy to get the horses ready immediately.\r\n\r\nBeing now left alone with her maid, she told her trusty waiting-woman,\r\n“That she never was more easy than at present. I am now convinced,”\r\n said she, “he is not only a villain, but a low despicable wretch. I\r\ncan forgive all rather than his exposing my name in so barbarous a\r\nmanner. That renders him the object of my contempt. Yes, Honour, I am\r\nnow easy; I am indeed; I am very easy;” and then she burst into a\r\nviolent flood of tears.\r\n\r\nAfter a short interval spent by Sophia, chiefly in crying, and\r\nassuring her maid that she was perfectly easy, Susan arrived with an\r\naccount that the horses were ready, when a very extraordinary thought\r\nsuggested itself to our young heroine, by which Mr Jones would be\r\nacquainted with her having been at the inn, in a way which, if any\r\nsparks of affection for her remained in him, would be at least some\r\npunishment for his faults.\r\n\r\nThe reader will be pleased to remember a little muff, which hath had\r\nthe honour of being more than once remembered already in this history.\r\nThis muff, ever since the departure of Mr Jones, had been the constant\r\ncompanion of Sophia by day, and her bedfellow by night; and this muff\r\nshe had at this very instant upon her arm; whence she took it off with\r\ngreat indignation, and, having writ her name with her pencil upon a\r\npiece of paper which she pinned to it, she bribed the maid to convey\r\nit into the empty bed of Mr Jones, in which, if he did not find it,\r\nshe charged her to take some method of conveying it before his eyes in\r\nthe morning.\r\n\r\nThen, having paid for what Mrs Honour had eaten, in which bill was\r\nincluded an account for what she herself might have eaten, she mounted\r\nher horse, and, once more assuring her companion that she was\r\nperfectly easy, continued her journey."

      "content": "Containing, among other things, the ingenuity of Partridge, the\r\nmadness of Jones, and the folly of Fitzpatrick.\r\n\nIt was now past five in the morning, and other company began to rise\r\nand come to the kitchen, among whom were the serjeant and the\r\ncoachman, who, being thoroughly reconciled, made a libation, or, in\r\nthe English phrase, drank a hearty cup together.\r\n\r\nIn this drinking nothing more remarkable happened than the behaviour\r\nof Partridge, who, when the serjeant drank a health to King George,\r\nrepeated only the word King; nor could he be brought to utter more;\r\nfor though he was going to fight against his own cause, yet he could\r\nnot be prevailed upon to drink against it.\r\n\r\nMr Jones, being now returned to his own bed (but from whence he\r\nreturned we must beg to be excused from relating), summoned Partridge\r\nfrom this agreeable company, who, after a ceremonious preface, having\r\nobtained leave to offer his advice, delivered himself as follows:--\r\n\r\n“It is, sir, an old saying, and a true one, that a wise man may\r\nsometimes learn counsel from a fool; I wish, therefore, I might be so\r\nbold as to offer you my advice, which is to return home again, and\r\nleave these _horrida bella_, these bloody wars, to fellows who are\r\ncontented to swallow gunpowder, because they have nothing else to eat.\r\nNow, everybody knows your honour wants for nothing at home; when\r\nthat's the case, why should any man travel abroad?”\r\n\r\n“Partridge,” cries Jones, “thou art certainly a coward; I wish,\r\ntherefore, thou wouldst return home thyself, and trouble me no more.”\r\n\r\n“I ask your honour's pardon,” cries Partridge; “I spoke on your\r\naccount more than my own; for as to me, Heaven knows my circumstances\r\nare bad enough, and I am so far from being afraid, that I value a\r\npistol, or a blunderbuss, or any such thing, no more than a pop-gun.\r\nEvery man must die once, and what signifies the manner how? besides,\r\nperhaps I may come off with the loss only of an arm or a leg. I assure\r\nyou, sir, I was never less afraid in my life; and so, if your honour\r\nis resolved to go on, I am resolved to follow you. But, in that case,\r\nI wish I might give my opinion. To be sure, it is a scandalous way of\r\ntravelling, for a great gentleman like you to walk afoot. Now here are\r\ntwo or three good horses in the stable, which the landlord will\r\ncertainly make no scruple of trusting you with; but, if he should, I\r\ncan easily contrive to take them; and, let the worst come to the\r\nworst, the king would certainly pardon you, as you are going to fight\r\nin his cause.”\r\n\r\nNow, as the honesty of Partridge was equal to his understanding, and\r\nboth dealt only in small matters, he would never have attempted a\r\nroguery of this kind, had he not imagined it altogether safe; for he\r\nwas one of those who have more consideration of the gallows than of\r\nthe fitness of things; but, in reality, he thought he might have\r\ncommitted this felony without any danger; for, besides that he doubted\r\nnot but the name of Mr Allworthy would sufficiently quiet the\r\nlandlord, he conceived they should be altogether safe, whatever turn\r\naffairs might take; as Jones, he imagined, would have friends enough\r\non one side, and as his friends would as well secure him on the other.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr Jones found that Partridge was in earnest in this proposal, he\r\nvery severely rebuked him, and that in such bitter terms, that the\r\nother attempted to laugh it off, and presently turned the discourse to\r\nother matters; saying, he believed they were then in a bawdy house,\r\nand that he had with much ado prevented two wenches from disturbing\r\nhis honour in the middle of the night. “Heyday!” says he, “I believe\r\nthey got into your chamber whether I would or no; for here lies the\r\nmuff of one of them on the ground.” Indeed, as Jones returned to his\r\nbed in the dark, he had never perceived the muff on the quilt, and, in\r\nleaping into his bed, he had tumbled it on the floor. This Partridge\r\nnow took up, and was going to put into his pocket, when Jones desired\r\nto see it. The muff was so very remarkable, that our heroe might\r\npossibly have recollected it without the information annexed. But his\r\nmemory was not put to that hard office; for at the same instant he saw\r\nand read the words Sophia Western upon the paper which was pinned to\r\nit. His looks now grew frantic in a moment, and he eagerly cried out,\r\n“Oh Heavens! how came this muff here?” “I know no more than your\r\nhonour,” cried Partridge; “but I saw it upon the arm of one of the\r\nwomen who would have disturbed you, if I would have suffered them.”\r\n “Where are they?” cries Jones, jumping out of bed, and laying hold of\r\nhis cloaths. “Many miles off, I believe, by this time,” said\r\nPartridge. And now Jones, upon further enquiry, was sufficiently\r\nassured that the bearer of this muff was no other than the lovely\r\nSophia herself.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of Jones on this occasion, his thoughts, his looks, his\r\nwords, his actions, were such as beggar all description. After many\r\nbitter execrations on Partridge, and not fewer on himself, he ordered\r\nthe poor fellow, who was frightened out of his wits, to run down and\r\nhire him horses at any rate; and a very few minutes afterwards, having\r\nshuffled on his clothes, he hastened down-stairs to execute the orders\r\nhimself, which he had just before given.\r\n\r\nBut before we proceed to what passed on his arrival in the kitchen, it\r\nwill be necessary to recur to what had there happened since Partridge\r\nhad first left it on his master's summons.\r\n\r\nThe serjeant was just marched off with his party, when the two Irish\r\ngentlemen arose, and came downstairs; both complaining that they had\r\nbeen so often waked by the noises in the inn, that they had never once\r\nbeen able to close their eyes all night.\r\n\r\nThe coach which had brought the young lady and her maid, and which,\r\nperhaps, the reader may have hitherto concluded was her own, was,\r\nindeed, a returned coach belonging to Mr King, of Bath, one of the\r\nworthiest and honestest men that ever dealt in horse-flesh, and whose\r\ncoaches we heartily recommend to all our readers who travel that road.\r\nBy which means they may, perhaps, have the pleasure of riding in the\r\nvery coach, and being driven by the very coachman, that is recorded in\r\nthis history.\r\n\r\nThe coachman, having but two passengers, and hearing Mr Maclachlan was\r\ngoing to Bath, offered to carry him thither at a very moderate price.\r\nHe was induced to this by the report of the hostler, who said that the\r\nhorse which Mr Maclachlan had hired from Worcester would be much more\r\npleased with returning to his friends there than to prosecute a long\r\njourney; for that the said horse was rather a two-legged than a\r\nfour-legged animal.\r\n\r\nMr Maclachlan immediately closed with the proposal of the coachman,\r\nand, at the same time, persuaded his friend Fitzpatrick to accept of\r\nthe fourth place in the coach. This conveyance the soreness of his\r\nbones made more agreeable to him than a horse; and, being well assured\r\nof meeting with his wife at Bath, he thought a little delay would be\r\nof no consequence.\r\n\r\nMaclachlan, who was much the sharper man of the two, no sooner heard\r\nthat this lady came from Chester, with the other circumstances which\r\nhe learned from the hostler, than it came into his head that she might\r\npossibly be his friend's wife; and presently acquainted him with this\r\nsuspicion, which had never once occurred to Fitzpatrick himself. To\r\nsay the truth, he was one of those compositions which nature makes up\r\nin too great a hurry, and forgets to put any brains into their head.\r\n\r\nNow it happens to this sort of men, as to bad hounds, who never hit\r\noff a fault themselves; but no sooner doth a dog of sagacity open his\r\nmouth than they immediately do the same, and, without the guidance of\r\nany scent, run directly forwards as fast as they are able. In the same\r\nmanner, the very moment Mr Maclachlan had mentioned his apprehension,\r\nMr Fitzpatrick instantly concurred, and flew directly up-stairs, to\r\nsurprize his wife, before he knew where she was; and unluckily (as\r\nFortune loves to play tricks with those gentlemen who put themselves\r\nentirely under her conduct) ran his head against several doors and\r\nposts to no purpose. Much kinder was she to me, when she suggested\r\nthat simile of the hounds, just before inserted; since the poor wife\r\nmay, on these occasions, be so justly compared to a hunted hare. Like\r\nthat little wretched animal, she pricks up her ears to listen after\r\nthe voice of her pursuer; like her, flies away trembling when she\r\nhears it; and, like her, is generally overtaken and destroyed in the\r\nend.\r\n\r\nThis was not however the case at present; for after a long fruitless\r\nsearch, Mr Fitzpatrick returned to the kitchen, where, as if this had\r\nbeen a real chace, entered a gentleman hallowing as hunters do when\r\nthe hounds are at a fault. He was just alighted from his horse, and\r\nhad many attendants at his heels.\r\n\r\nHere, reader, it may be necessary to acquaint thee with some matters,\r\nwhich, if thou dost know already, thou art wiser than I take thee to\r\nbe. And this information thou shalt receive in the next chapter."

      "content": "In which are concluded the adventures that happened at the inn at\r\nUpton.\r\n\nIn the first place, then, this gentleman just arrived was no other\r\nperson than Squire Western himself, who was come hither in pursuit of\r\nhis daughter; and, had he fortunately been two hours earlier, he had\r\nnot only found her, but his niece into the bargain; for such was the\r\nwife of Mr Fitzpatrick, who had run away with her five years before,\r\nout of the custody of that sage lady, Madam Western.\r\n\r\nNow this lady had departed from the inn much about the same time with\r\nSophia; for, having been waked by the voice of her husband, she had\r\nsent up for the landlady, and being by her apprized of the matter, had\r\nbribed the good woman, at an extravagant price, to furnish her with\r\nhorses for her escape. Such prevalence had money in this family; and\r\nthough the mistress would have turned away her maid for a corrupt\r\nhussy, if she had known as much as the reader, yet she was no more\r\nproof against corruption herself than poor Susan had been.\r\n\r\nMr Western and his nephew were not known to one another; nor indeed\r\nwould the former have taken any notice of the latter if he had known\r\nhim; for, this being a stolen match, and consequently an unnatural one\r\nin the opinion of the good squire, he had, from the time of her\r\ncommitting it, abandoned the poor young creature, who was then no more\r\nthan eighteen, as a monster, and had never since suffered her to be\r\nnamed in his presence.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen was now a scene of universal confusion, Western enquiring\r\nafter his daughter, and Fitzpatrick as eagerly after his wife, when\r\nJones entered the room, unfortunately having Sophia's muff in his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Western saw Jones, he set up the same holla as is used by\r\nsportsmen when their game is in view. He then immediately run up and\r\nlaid hold of Jones, crying, “We have got the dog fox, I warrant the\r\nbitch is not far off.” The jargon which followed for some minutes,\r\nwhere many spoke different things at the same time, as it would be\r\nvery difficult to describe, so would it be no less unpleasant to read.\r\n\r\nJones having, at length, shaken Mr Western off, and some of the\r\ncompany having interfered between them, our heroe protested his\r\ninnocence as to knowing anything of the lady; when Parson Supple\r\nstepped up, and said, “It is folly to deny it; for why, the marks of\r\nguilt are in thy hands. I will myself asseverate and bind it by an\r\noath, that the muff thou bearest in thy hand belongeth unto Madam\r\nSophia; for I have frequently observed her, of later days, to bear it\r\nabout her.” “My daughter's muff!” cries the squire in a rage. “Hath he\r\ngot my daughter's muff? bear witness the goods are found upon him.\r\nI'll have him before a justice of peace this instant. Where is my\r\ndaughter, villain?” “Sir,” said Jones, “I beg you would be pacified.\r\nThe muff, I acknowledge, is the young lady's; but, upon my honour, I\r\nhave never seen her.” At these words Western lost all patience, and\r\ngrew inarticulate with rage.\r\n\r\nSome of the servants had acquainted Fitzpatrick who Mr Western was.\r\nThe good Irishman, therefore, thinking he had now an opportunity to do\r\nan act of service to his uncle, and by that means might possibly\r\nobtain his favour, stept up to Jones, and cried out, “Upon my\r\nconscience, sir, you may be ashamed of denying your having seen the\r\ngentleman's daughter before my face, when you know I found you there\r\nupon the bed together.” Then, turning to Western, he offered to\r\nconduct him immediately to the room where his daughter was; which\r\noffer being accepted, he, the squire, the parson, and some others,\r\nascended directly to Mrs Waters's chamber, which they entered with no\r\nless violence than Mr Fitzpatrick had done before.\r\n\r\nThe poor lady started from her sleep with as much amazement as terror,\r\nand beheld at her bedside a figure which might very well be supposed\r\nto have escaped out of Bedlam. Such wildness and confusion were in the\r\nlooks of Mr Western; who no sooner saw the lady than he started back,\r\nshewing sufficiently by his manner, before he spoke, that this was not\r\nthe person sought after.\r\n\r\nSo much more tenderly do women value their reputation than their\r\npersons, that, though the latter seemed now in more danger than\r\nbefore, yet, as the former was secure, the lady screamed not with such\r\nviolence as she had done on the other occasion. However, she no sooner\r\nfound herself alone than she abandoned all thoughts of further repose;\r\nand, as she had sufficient reason to be dissatisfied with her present\r\nlodging, she dressed herself with all possible expedition.\r\n\r\nMr Western now proceeded to search the whole house, but to as little\r\npurpose as he had disturbed poor Mrs Waters. He then returned\r\ndisconsolate into the kitchen, where he found Jones in the custody of\r\nhis servants.\r\n\r\nThis violent uproar had raised all the people in the house, though it\r\nwas yet scarcely daylight. Among these was a grave gentleman, who had\r\nthe honour to be in the commission of the peace for the county of\r\nWorcester. Of which Mr Western was no sooner informed than he offered\r\nto lay his complaint before him. The justice declined executing his\r\noffice, as he said he had no clerk present, nor no book about justice\r\nbusiness; and that he could not carry all the law in his head about\r\nstealing away daughters, and such sort of things.\r\n\r\nHere Mr Fitzpatrick offered to lend him his assistance, informing the\r\ncompany that he had been himself bred to the law. (And indeed he had\r\nserved three years as clerk to an attorney in the north of Ireland,\r\nwhen, chusing a genteeler walk in life, he quitted his master, came\r\nover to England, and set up that business which requires no\r\napprenticeship, namely, that of a gentleman, in which he had\r\nsucceeded, as hath been already partly mentioned.)\r\n\r\nMr Fitzpatrick declared that the law concerning daughters was out of\r\nthe present case; that stealing a muff was undoubtedly felony, and the\r\ngoods being found upon the person, were sufficient evidence of the\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nThe magistrate, upon the encouragement of so learned a coadjutor, and\r\nupon the violent intercession of the squire, was at length prevailed\r\nupon to seat himself in the chair of justice, where being placed, upon\r\nviewing the muff which Jones still held in his hand, and upon the\r\nparson's swearing it to be the property of Mr Western, he desired Mr\r\nFitzpatrick to draw up a commitment, which he said he would sign.\r\n\r\nJones now desired to be heard, which was at last, with difficulty,\r\ngranted him. He then produced the evidence of Mr Partridge, as to the\r\nfinding it; but, what was still more, Susan deposed that Sophia\r\nherself had delivered the muff to her, and had ordered her to convey\r\nit into the chamber where Mr Jones had found it.\r\n\r\nWhether a natural love of justice, or the extraordinary comeliness of\r\nJones, had wrought on Susan to make the discovery, I will not\r\ndetermine; but such were the effects of her evidence, that the\r\nmagistrate, throwing himself back in his chair, declared that the\r\nmatter was now altogether as clear on the side of the prisoner as it\r\nhad before been against him: with which the parson concurred, saying,\r\nthe Lord forbid he should be instrumental in committing an innocent\r\nperson to durance. The justice then arose, acquitted the prisoner, and\r\nbroke up the court.\r\n\r\nMr Western now gave every one present a hearty curse, and, immediately\r\nordering his horses, departed in pursuit of his daughter, without\r\ntaking the least notice of his nephew Fitzpatrick, or returning any\r\nanswer to his claim of kindred, notwithstanding all the obligations he\r\nhad just received from that gentleman. In the violence, moreover, of\r\nhis hurry, and of his passion, he luckily forgot to demand the muff of\r\nJones: I say luckily; for he would have died on the spot rather than\r\nhave parted with it.\r\n\r\nJones likewise, with his friend Partridge, set forward the moment he\r\nhad paid his reckoning, in quest of his lovely Sophia, whom he now\r\nresolved never more to abandon the pursuit of. Nor could he bring\r\nhimself even to take leave of Mrs Waters; of whom he detested the very\r\nthoughts, as she had been, though not designedly, the occasion of his\r\nmissing the happiest interview with Sophia, to whom he now vowed\r\neternal constancy.\r\n\r\nAs for Mrs Waters, she took the opportunity of the coach which was\r\ngoing to Bath; for which place she set out in company with the two\r\nIrish gentlemen, the landlady kindly lending her her cloaths; in\r\nreturn for which she was contented only to receive about double their\r\nvalue, as a recompence for the loan. Upon the road she was perfectly\r\nreconciled to Mr Fitzpatrick, who was a very handsome fellow, and\r\nindeed did all she could to console him in the absence of his wife.\r\n\r\nThus ended the many odd adventures which Mr Jones encountered at his\r\ninn at Upton, where they talk, to this day, of the beauty and lovely\r\nbehaviour of the charming Sophia, by the name of the Somersetshire\r\nangel."

      "content": "In which the history goes backward.\r\n\nBefore we proceed any farther in our history, it may be proper to look\r\na little back, in order to account for the extraordinary appearance of\r\nSophia and her father at the inn at Upton.\r\n\r\nThe reader may be pleased to remember that, in the ninth chapter of\r\nthe seventh book of our history, we left Sophia, after a long debate\r\nbetween love and duty, deciding the cause, as it usually, I believe,\r\nhappens, in favour of the former.\r\n\r\nThis debate had arisen, as we have there shown, from a visit which her\r\nfather had just before made her, in order to force her consent to a\r\nmarriage with Blifil; and which he had understood to be fully implied\r\nin her acknowledgment “that she neither must nor could refuse any\r\nabsolute command of his.”\r\n\r\nNow from this visit the squire retired to his evening potation,\r\noverjoyed at the success he had gained with his daughter; and, as he\r\nwas of a social disposition, and willing to have partakers in his\r\nhappiness, the beer was ordered to flow very liberally into the\r\nkitchen; so that before eleven in the evening there was not a single\r\nperson sober in the house except only Mrs Western herself and the\r\ncharming Sophia.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning a messenger was despatched to summon Mr Blifil;\r\nfor, though the squire imagined that young gentleman had been much\r\nless acquainted than he really was with the former aversion of his\r\ndaughter, as he had not, however, yet received her consent, he longed\r\nimpatiently to communicate it to him, not doubting but that the\r\nintended bride herself would confirm it with her lips. As to the\r\nwedding, it had the evening before been fixed, by the male parties, to\r\nbe celebrated on the next morning save one.\r\n\r\nBreakfast was now set forth in the parlour, where Mr Blifil attended,\r\nand where the squire and his sister likewise were assembled; and now\r\nSophia was ordered to be called.\r\n\r\nO, Shakespear! had I thy pen! O, Hogarth! had I thy pencil! then would\r\nI draw the picture of the poor serving-man, who, with pale\r\ncountenance, staring eyes, chattering teeth, faultering tongue, and\r\ntrembling limbs,\r\n\r\n (E'en such a man, so faint, so spiritless,\r\n So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone,\r\n Drew Priam's curtains in the dead of night,\r\n And would have told him, half his Troy was burn'd)\r\n\r\nentered the room, and declared--That Madam Sophia was not to be found.\r\n\r\n“Not to be found!” cries the squire, starting from his chair; “Zounds\r\nand d--nation! Blood and fury! Where, when, how, what--Not to be\r\nfound! Where?”\r\n\r\n“La! brother,” said Mrs Western, with true political coldness, “you\r\nare always throwing yourself into such violent passions for nothing.\r\nMy niece, I suppose, is only walked out into the garden. I protest you\r\nare grown so unreasonable, that it is impossible to live in the house\r\nwith you.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, nay,” answered the squire, returning as suddenly to himself, as\r\nhe had gone from himself; “if that be all the matter, it signifies not\r\nmuch; but, upon my soul, my mind misgave me when the fellow said she\r\nwas not to be found.” He then gave orders for the bell to be rung in\r\nthe garden, and sat himself contentedly down.\r\n\r\nNo two things could be more the reverse of each other than were the\r\nbrother and sister in most instances; particularly in this, That as\r\nthe brother never foresaw anything at a distance, but was most\r\nsagacious in immediately seeing everything the moment it had happened;\r\nso the sister eternally foresaw at a distance, but was not so\r\nquick-sighted to objects before her eyes. Of both these the reader may\r\nhave observed examples: and, indeed, both their several talents were\r\nexcessive; for, as the sister often foresaw what never came to pass,\r\nso the brother often saw much more than was actually the truth.\r\n\r\nThis was not however the case at present. The same report was brought\r\nfrom the garden as before had been brought from the chamber, that\r\nMadam Sophia was not to be found.\r\n\r\nThe squire himself now sallied forth, and began to roar forth the name\r\nof Sophia as loudly, and in as hoarse a voice, as whilome did Hercules\r\nthat of Hylas; and, as the poet tells us that the whole shore echoed\r\nback the name of that beautiful youth, so did the house, the garden,\r\nand all the neighbouring fields resound nothing but the name of\r\nSophia, in the hoarse voices of the men, and in the shrill pipes of\r\nthe women; while echo seemed so pleased to repeat the beloved sound,\r\nthat, if there is really such a person, I believe Ovid hath belied her\r\nsex.\r\n\r\nNothing reigned for a long time but confusion; till at last the\r\nsquire, having sufficiently spent his breath, returned to the parlour,\r\nwhere he found Mrs Western and Mr Blifil, and threw himself, with the\r\nutmost dejection in his countenance, into a great chair.\r\n\r\nHere Mrs Western began to apply the following consolation:\r\n\r\n“Brother, I am sorry for what hath happened; and that my niece should\r\nhave behaved herself in a manner so unbecoming her family; but it is\r\nall your own doings, and you have nobody to thank but yourself. You\r\nknow she hath been educated always in a manner directly contrary to my\r\nadvice, and now you see the consequence. Have I not a thousand times\r\nargued with you about giving my niece her own will? But you know I\r\nnever could prevail upon you; and when I had taken so much pains to\r\neradicate her headstrong opinions, and to rectify your errors in\r\npolicy, you know she was taken out of my hands; so that I have nothing\r\nto answer for. Had I been trusted entirely with the care of her\r\neducation, no such accident as this had ever befallen you; so that you\r\nmust comfort yourself by thinking it was all your own doing; and,\r\nindeed, what else could be expected from such indulgence?”\r\n\r\n“Zounds! sister,” answered he, “you are enough to make one mad. Have I\r\nindulged her? Have I given her her will?----It was no longer ago than\r\nlast night that I threatened, if she disobeyed me, to confine her to\r\nher chamber upon bread and water as long as she lived.----You would\r\nprovoke the patience of Job.”\r\n\r\n“Did ever mortal hear the like?” replied she. “Brother, if I had not\r\nthe patience of fifty Jobs, you would make me forget all decency and\r\ndecorum. Why would you interfere? Did I not beg you, did I not intreat\r\nyou, to leave the whole conduct to me? You have defeated all the\r\noperations of the campaign by one false step. Would any man in his\r\nsenses have provoked a daughter by such threats as these? How often\r\nhave I told you that English women are not to be treated like\r\nCiracessian[*] slaves. We have the protection of the world; we are to\r\nbe won by gentle means only, and not to be hectored, and bullied, and\r\nbeat into compliance. I thank Heaven no Salique law governs here.\r\nBrother, you have a roughness in your manner which no woman but myself\r\nwould bear. I do not wonder my niece was frightened and terrified into\r\ntaking this measure; and, to speak honestly, I think my niece will be\r\njustified to the world for what she hath done. I repeat it to you\r\nagain, brother, you must comfort yourself by rememb'ring that it is\r\nall your own fault. How often have I advised--” Here Western rose\r\nhastily from his chair, and, venting two or three horrid imprecations,\r\nran out of the room.\r\n\r\n [*] Possibly Circassian.\r\n\r\nWhen he was departed, his sister expressed more bitterness (if\r\npossible) against him than she had done while he was present; for the\r\ntruth of which she appealed to Mr Blifil, who, with great complacence,\r\nacquiesced entirely in all she said; but excused all the faults of Mr\r\nWestern, “as they must be considered,” he said, “to have proceeded\r\nfrom the too inordinate fondness of a father, which must be allowed\r\nthe name of an amiable weakness.” “So much the more inexcuseable,”\r\n answered the lady; “for whom doth he ruin by his fondness but his own\r\nchild?” To which Blifil immediately agreed.\r\n\r\nMrs Western then began to express great confusion on the account of Mr\r\nBlifil, and of the usage which he had received from a family to which\r\nhe intended so much honour. On this subject she treated the folly of\r\nher niece with great severity; but concluded with throwing the whole\r\non her brother, who, she said, was inexcuseable to have proceeded so\r\nfar without better assurances of his daughter's consent: “But he was\r\n(says she) always of a violent, headstrong temper; and I can scarce\r\nforgive myself for all the advice I have thrown away upon him.”\r\n\r\nAfter much of this kind of conversation, which, perhaps, would not\r\ngreatly entertain the reader, was it here particularly related, Mr\r\nBlifil took his leave and returned home, not highly pleased with his\r\ndisappointment: which, however, the philosophy which he had acquired\r\nfrom Square, and the religion infused into him by Thwackum, together\r\nwith somewhat else, taught him to bear rather better than more\r\npassionate lovers bear these kinds of evils."

      "content": "The escape of Sophia.\r\n\nIt is now time to look after Sophia; whom the reader, if he loves her\r\nhalf so well as I do, will rejoice to find escaped from the clutches\r\nof her passionate father, and from those of her dispassionate lover.\r\n\r\nTwelve times did the iron register of time beat on the sonorous\r\nbell-metal, summoning the ghosts to rise and walk their nightly\r\nround.----In plainer language, it was twelve o'clock, and all the\r\nfamily, as we have said, lay buried in drink and sleep, except only\r\nMrs Western, who was deeply engaged in reading a political pamphlet,\r\nand except our heroine, who now softly stole down-stairs, and, having\r\nunbarred and unlocked one of the house-doors, sallied forth, and\r\nhastened to the place of appointment.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the many pretty arts which ladies sometimes practise,\r\nto display their fears on every little occasion (almost as many as the\r\nother sex uses to conceal theirs), certainly there is a degree of\r\ncourage which not only becomes a woman, but is often necessary to\r\nenable her to discharge her duty. It is, indeed, the idea of\r\nfierceness, and not of bravery, which destroys the female character;\r\nfor who can read the story of the justly celebrated Arria without\r\nconceiving as high an opinion of her gentleness and tenderness as of\r\nher fortitude? At the same time, perhaps, many a woman who shrieks at\r\na mouse, or a rat, may be capable of poisoning a husband; or, what is\r\nworse, of driving him to poison himself.\r\n\r\nSophia, with all the gentleness which a woman can have, had all the\r\nspirit which she ought to have. When, therefore, she came to the place\r\nof appointment, and, instead of meeting her maid, as was agreed, saw a\r\nman ride directly up to her, she neither screamed out nor fainted\r\naway: not that her pulse then beat with its usual regularity; for she\r\nwas, at first, under some surprize and apprehension: but these were\r\nrelieved almost as soon as raised, when the man, pulling off his hat,\r\nasked her, in a very submissive manner, “If her ladyship did not\r\nexpect to meet another lady?” and then proceeded to inform her that he\r\nwas sent to conduct her to that lady.\r\n\r\nSophia could have no possible suspicion of any falsehood in this\r\naccount: she therefore mounted resolutely behind the fellow, who\r\nconveyed her safe to a town about five miles distant, where she had\r\nthe satisfaction of finding the good Mrs Honour: for, as the soul of\r\nthe waiting-woman was wrapt up in those very habiliments which used to\r\nenwrap her body, she could by no means bring herself to trust them out\r\nof her sight. Upon these, therefore, she kept guard in person, while\r\nshe detached the aforesaid fellow after her mistress, having given him\r\nall proper instructions.\r\n\r\nThey now debated what course to take, in order to avoid the pursuit of\r\nMr Western, who they knew would send after them in a few hours. The\r\nLondon road had such charms for Honour, that she was desirous of going\r\non directly; alleging that, as Sophia could not be missed till eight\r\nor nine the next morning, her pursuers would not be able to overtake\r\nher, even though they knew which way she had gone. But Sophia had too\r\nmuch at stake to venture anything to chance; nor did she dare trust\r\ntoo much to her tender limbs, in a contest which was to be decided\r\nonly by swiftness. She resolved, therefore, to travel across the\r\ncountry, for at least twenty or thirty miles, and then to take the\r\ndirect road to London. So, having hired horses to go twenty miles one\r\nway, when she intended to go twenty miles the other, she set forward\r\nwith the same guide behind whom she had ridden from her father's\r\nhouse; the guide having now taken up behind him, in the room of\r\nSophia, a much heavier, as well as much less lovely burden; being,\r\nindeed, a huge portmanteau, well stuffed with those outside ornaments,\r\nby means of which the fair Honour hoped to gain many conquests, and,\r\nfinally, to make her fortune in London city.\r\n\r\nWhen they had gone about two hundred paces from the inn on the London\r\nroad, Sophia rode up to the guide, and, with a voice much fuller of\r\nhoney than was ever that of Plato, though his mouth is supposed to\r\nhave been a bee-hive, begged him to take the first turning which led\r\ntowards Bristol.\r\n\r\nReader, I am not superstitious, nor any great believer of modern\r\nmiracles. I do not, therefore, deliver the following as a certain\r\ntruth; for, indeed, I can scarce credit it myself: but the fidelity of\r\nan historian obliges me to relate what hath been confidently asserted.\r\nThe horse, then, on which the guide rode, is reported to have been so\r\ncharmed by Sophia's voice, that he made a full stop, and expressed an\r\nunwillingness to proceed any farther.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, however, the fact may be true, and less miraculous than it\r\nhath been represented; since the natural cause seems adequate to the\r\neffect: for, as the guide at that moment desisted from a constant\r\napplication of his armed right heel (for, like Hudibras, he wore but\r\none spur), it is more than possible that this omission alone might\r\noccasion the beast to stop, especially as this was very frequent with\r\nhim at other times.\r\n\r\nBut if the voice of Sophia had really an effect on the horse, it had\r\nvery little on the rider. He answered somewhat surlily, “That measter\r\nhad ordered him to go a different way, and that he should lose his\r\nplace if he went any other than that he was ordered.”\r\n\r\nSophia, finding all her persuasions had no effect, began now to add\r\nirresistible charms to her voice; charms which, according to the\r\nproverb, makes the old mare trot, instead of standing still; charms!\r\nto which modern ages have attributed all that irresistible force which\r\nthe antients imputed to perfect oratory. In a word, she promised she\r\nwould reward him to his utmost expectation.\r\n\r\nThe lad was not totally deaf to these promises; but he disliked their\r\nbeing indefinite; for, though perhaps he had never heard that word,\r\nyet that, in fact, was his objection. He said, “Gentlevolks did not\r\nconsider the case of poor volks; that he had like to have been turned\r\naway the other day, for riding about the country with a gentleman from\r\nSquire Allworthy's, who did not reward him as he should have done.”\r\n\r\n“With whom?” says Sophia eagerly. “With a gentleman from Squire\r\nAllworthy's,” repeated the lad; “the squire's son, I think they call\r\n'un.”--“Whither? which way did he go?” says Sophia.--“Why, a little o'\r\none side o' Bristol, about twenty miles off,” answered the\r\nlad.--“Guide me,” says Sophia, “to the same place, and I'll give thee\r\na guinea, or two, if one is not sufficient.”--“To be certain,” said\r\nthe boy, “it is honestly worth two, when your ladyship considers what\r\na risk I run; but, however, if your ladyship will promise me the two\r\nguineas, I'll e'en venture: to be certain it is a sinful thing to ride\r\nabout my measter's horses; but one comfort is, I can only be turned\r\naway, and two guineas will partly make me amends.”\r\n\r\nThe bargain being thus struck, the lad turned aside into the Bristol\r\nroad, and Sophia set forward in pursuit of Jones, highly contrary to\r\nthe remonstrances of Mrs Honour, who had much more desire to see London\r\nthan to see Mr Jones: for indeed she was not his friend with her\r\nmistress, as he had been guilty of some neglect in certain pecuniary\r\ncivilities, which are by custom due to the waiting-gentlewoman in all\r\nlove affairs, and more especially in those of a clandestine kind. This\r\nwe impute rather to the carelessness of his temper than to any want of\r\ngenerosity; but perhaps she derived it from the latter motive. Certain\r\nit is that she hated him very bitterly on that account, and resolved to\r\ntake every opportunity of injuring him with her mistress. It was\r\ntherefore highly unlucky for her, that she had gone to the very same\r\ntown and inn whence Jones had started, and still more unlucky was she\r\nin having stumbled on the same guide, and on this accidental discovery\r\nwhich Sophia had made.\r\n\r\nOur travellers arrived at Hambrook[*] at the break of day, where\r\nHonour was against her will charged to enquire the route which Mr\r\nJones had taken. Of this, indeed, the guide himself could have\r\ninformed them; but Sophia, I know not for what reason, never asked him\r\nthe question.\r\n\r\n [*] This was the village where Jones met the Quaker.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs Honour had made her report from the landlord, Sophia, with\r\nmuch difficulty, procured some indifferent horses, which brought her\r\nto the inn where Jones had been confined rather by the misfortune of\r\nmeeting with a surgeon than by having met with a broken head.\r\n\r\nHere Honour, being again charged with a commission of enquiry, had no\r\nsooner applied herself to the landlady, and had described the person\r\nof Mr Jones, than that sagacious woman began, in the vulgar phrase, to\r\nsmell a rat. When Sophia therefore entered the room, instead of\r\nanswering the maid, the landlady, addressing herself to the mistress,\r\nbegan the following speech: “Good lack-a-day! why there now, who would\r\nhave thought it? I protest the loveliest couple that ever eye beheld.\r\nI-fackins, madam, it is no wonder the squire run on so about your\r\nladyship. He told me indeed you was the finest lady in the world, and\r\nto be sure so you be. Mercy on him, poor heart! I bepitied him, so I\r\ndid, when he used to hug his pillow, and call it his dear Madam\r\nSophia. I did all I could to dissuade him from going to the wars: I\r\ntold him there were men enow that were good for nothing else but to be\r\nkilled, that had not the love of such fine ladies.” “Sure,” says\r\nSophia, “the good woman is distracted.” “No, no,” cries the landlady,\r\n“I am not distracted. What, doth your ladyship think I don't know\r\nthen? I assure you he told me all.” “What saucy fellow,” cries Honour,\r\n“told you anything of my lady?” “No saucy fellow,” answered the\r\nlandlady, “but the young gentleman you enquired after, and a very\r\npretty young gentleman he is, and he loves Madam Sophia Western to the\r\nbottom of his soul.” “He love my lady! I'd have you to know, woman,\r\nshe is meat for his master.”--“Nay, Honour,” said Sophia, interrupting\r\nher, “don't be angry with the good woman; she intends no harm.” “No,\r\nmarry, don't I,” answered the landlady, emboldened by the soft accents\r\nof Sophia; and then launched into a long narrative too tedious to be\r\nhere set down, in which some passages dropt that gave a little offence\r\nto Sophia, and much more to her waiting-woman, who hence took occasion\r\nto abuse poor Jones to her mistress the moment they were alone\r\ntogether, saying, “that he must be a very pitiful fellow, and could\r\nhave no love for a lady, whose name he would thus prostitute in an\r\nale-house.”\r\n\r\nSophia did not see his behaviour in so very disadvantageous a light,\r\nand was perhaps more pleased with the violent raptures of his love\r\n(which the landlady exaggerated as much as she had done every other\r\ncircumstance) than she was offended with the rest; and indeed she\r\nimputed the whole to the extravagance, or rather ebullience, of his\r\npassion, and to the openness of his heart.\r\n\r\nThis incident, however, being afterwards revived in her mind, and\r\nplaced in the most odious colours by Honour, served to heighten and\r\ngive credit to those unlucky occurrences at Upton, and assisted the\r\nwaiting-woman in her endeavours to make her mistress depart from that\r\ninn without seeing Jones.\r\n\r\nThe landlady finding Sophia intended to stay no longer than till her\r\nhorses were ready, and that without either eating or drinking, soon\r\nwithdrew; when Honour began to take her mistress to task (for indeed\r\nshe used great freedom), and after a long harangue, in which she\r\nreminded her of her intention to go to London, and gave frequent hints\r\nof the impropriety of pursuing a young fellow, she at last concluded\r\nwith this serious exhortation: “For heaven's sake, madam, consider\r\nwhat you are about, and whither you are going.”\r\n\r\nThis advice to a lady who had already rode near forty miles, and in no\r\nvery agreeable season, may seem foolish enough. It may be supposed she\r\nhad well considered and resolved this already; nay, Mrs Honour, by the\r\nhints she threw out, seemed to think so; and this I doubt not is the\r\nopinion of many readers, who have, I make no doubt, been long since\r\nwell convinced of the purpose of our heroine, and have heartily\r\ncondemned her for it as a wanton baggage.\r\n\r\nBut in reality this was not the case. Sophia had been lately so\r\ndistracted between hope and fear, her duty and love to her father, her\r\nhatred to Blifil, her compassion, and (why should we not confess the\r\ntruth?) her love for Jones; which last the behaviour of her father, of\r\nher aunt, of every one else, and more particularly of Jones himself,\r\nhad blown into a flame, that her mind was in that confused state which\r\nmay be truly said to make us ignorant of what we do, or whither we go,\r\nor rather, indeed, indifferent as to the consequence of either.\r\n\r\nThe prudent and sage advice of her maid produced, however, some cool\r\nreflection; and she at length determined to go to Gloucester, and\r\nthence to proceed directly to London.\r\n\r\nBut, unluckily, a few miles before she entered that town, she met the\r\nhack-attorney, who, as is before mentioned, had dined there with Mr\r\nJones. This fellow, being well known to Mrs Honour, stopt and spoke to\r\nher; of which Sophia at that time took little notice, more than to\r\nenquire who he was.\r\n\r\nBut, having had a more particular account from Honour of this man\r\nafterwards at Gloucester, and hearing of the great expedition he\r\nusually made in travelling, for which (as hath been before observed)\r\nhe was particularly famous; recollecting, likewise, that she had\r\noverheard Mrs Honour inform him that they were going to Gloucester,\r\nshe began to fear lest her father might, by this fellow's means, be\r\nable to trace her to that city; wherefore, if she should there strike\r\ninto the London road, she apprehended he would certainly be able to\r\novertake her. She therefore altered her resolution; and, having hired\r\nhorses to go a week's journey a way which she did not intend to\r\ntravel, she again set forward after a light refreshment, contrary to\r\nthe desire and earnest entreaties of her maid, and to the no less\r\nvehement remonstrances of Mrs Whitefield, who, from good breeding, or\r\nperhaps from good nature (for the poor young lady appeared much\r\nfatigued), pressed her very heartily to stay that evening at\r\nGloucester.\r\n\r\nHaving refreshed herself only with some tea, and with lying about two\r\nhours on the bed, while her horses were getting ready, she resolutely\r\nleft Mrs Whitefield's about eleven at night, and, striking directly\r\ninto the Worcester road, within less than four hours arrived at that\r\nvery inn where we last saw her.\r\n\r\nHaving thus traced our heroine very particularly back from her\r\ndeparture, till her arrival at Upton, we shall in a very few words\r\nbring her father to the same place; who, having received the first\r\nscent from the post-boy, who conducted his daughter to Hambrook, very\r\neasily traced her afterwards to Gloucester; whence he pursued her to\r\nUpton, as he had learned Mr Jones had taken that route (for Partridge,\r\nto use the squire's expression, left everywhere a strong scent behind\r\nhim), and he doubted not in the least but Sophia travelled, or, as he\r\nphrased it, ran, the same way. He used indeed a very coarse\r\nexpression, which need not be here inserted; as fox-hunters, who alone\r\nwill understand it, will easily suggest it to themselves.\r\n\nBOOK XI.\r\n\r\nCONTAINING ABOUT THREE DAYS."

      "title": "Chapter i.",
      "content": "A crust for the critics.\r\n\nIn our last initial chapter we may be supposed to have treated that\r\nformidable set of men who are called critics with more freedom than\r\nbecomes us; since they exact, and indeed generally receive, great\r\ncondescension from authors. We shall in this, therefore, give the\r\nreasons of our conduct to this august body; and here we shall,\r\nperhaps, place them in a light in which they have not hitherto been\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nThis word critic is of Greek derivation, and signifies judgment. Hence\r\nI presume some persons who have not understood the original, and have\r\nseen the English translation of the primitive, have concluded that it\r\nmeant judgment in the legal sense, in which it is frequently used as\r\nequivalent to condemnation.\r\n\r\nI am the rather inclined to be of that opinion, as the greatest number\r\nof critics hath of late years been found amongst the lawyers. Many of\r\nthese gentlemen, from despair, perhaps, of ever rising to the bench in\r\nWestminster-hall, have placed themselves on the benches at the\r\nplayhouse, where they have exerted their judicial capacity, and have\r\ngiven judgment, _i.e._, condemned without mercy.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen would, perhaps, be well enough pleased, if we were to\r\nleave them thus compared to one of the most important and honourable\r\noffices in the commonwealth, and, if we intended to apply to their\r\nfavour, we would do so; but, as we design to deal very sincerely and\r\nplainly too with them, we must remind them of another officer of\r\njustice of a much lower rank; to whom, as they not only pronounce, but\r\nexecute, their own judgment, they bear likewise some remote\r\nresemblance.\r\n\r\nBut in reality there is another light, in which these modern critics\r\nmay, with great justice and propriety, be seen; and this is that of a\r\ncommon slanderer. If a person who prys into the characters of others,\r\nwith no other design but to discover their faults, and to publish them\r\nto the world, deserves the title of a slanderer of the reputations of\r\nmen, why should not a critic, who reads with the same malevolent view,\r\nbe as properly stiled the slanderer of the reputation of books?\r\n\r\nVice hath not, I believe, a more abject slave; society produces not a\r\nmore odious vermin; nor can the devil receive a guest more worthy of\r\nhim, nor possibly more welcome to him, than a slanderer. The world, I\r\nam afraid, regards not this monster with half the abhorrence which he\r\ndeserves; and I am more afraid to assign the reason of this criminal\r\nlenity shown towards him; yet it is certain that the thief looks\r\ninnocent in the comparison; nay, the murderer himself can seldom stand\r\nin competition with his guilt: for slander is a more cruel weapon than\r\na sword, as the wounds which the former gives are always incurable.\r\nOne method, indeed, there is of killing, and that the basest and most\r\nexecrable of all, which bears an exact analogy to the vice here\r\ndisclaimed against, and that is poison: a means of revenge so base,\r\nand yet so horrible, that it was once wisely distinguished by our laws\r\nfrom all other murders, in the peculiar severity of the punishment.\r\n\r\nBesides the dreadful mischiefs done by slander, and the baseness of\r\nthe means by which they are effected, there are other circumstances\r\nthat highly aggravate its atrocious quality; for it often proceeds\r\nfrom no provocation, and seldom promises itself any reward, unless\r\nsome black and infernal mind may propose a reward in the thoughts of\r\nhaving procured the ruin and misery of another.\r\n\r\nShakespear hath nobly touched this vice, when he says--\r\n\r\n “Who steals my purse steals trash; 't is something, nothing;\r\n 'Twas mine, 'tis his, and hath been slave to thousands:\r\n But he that filches from me my good name\r\n Robs me of that WHICH NOT ENRICHES HIM,\r\n BUT MAKES ME POOR INDEED.”\r\n\r\nWith all this my good reader will doubtless agree; but much of it will\r\nprobably seem too severe, when applied to the slanderer of books. But\r\nlet it here be considered that both proceed from the same wicked\r\ndisposition of mind, and are alike void of the excuse of temptation.\r\nNor shall we conclude the injury done this way to be very slight, when\r\nwe consider a book as the author's offspring, and indeed as the child\r\nof his brain.\r\n\r\nThe reader who hath suffered his muse to continue hitherto in a virgin\r\nstate can have but a very inadequate idea of this kind of paternal\r\nfondness. To such we may parody the tender exclamation of Macduff,\r\n“Alas! Thou hast written no book.” But the author whose muse hath\r\nbrought forth will feel the pathetic strain, perhaps will accompany me\r\nwith tears (especially if his darling be already no more), while I\r\nmention the uneasiness with which the big muse bears about her burden,\r\nthe painful labour with which she produces it, and, lastly, the care,\r\nthe fondness, with which the tender father nourishes his favourite,\r\ntill it be brought to maturity, and produced into the world.\r\n\r\nNor is there any paternal fondness which seems less to savour of\r\nabsolute instinct, and which may so well be reconciled to worldly\r\nwisdom, as this. These children may most truly be called the riches of\r\ntheir father; and many of them have with true filial piety fed their\r\nparent in his old age: so that not only the affection, but the\r\ninterest, of the author may be highly injured by these slanderers,\r\nwhose poisonous breath brings his book to an untimely end.\r\n\r\nLastly, the slander of a book is, in truth, the slander of the author:\r\nfor, as no one can call another bastard, without calling the mother a\r\nwhore, so neither can any one give the names of sad stuff, horrid\r\nnonsense, &c., to a book, without calling the author a blockhead;\r\nwhich, though in a moral sense it is a preferable appellation to that\r\nof villain, is perhaps rather more injurious to his worldly interest.\r\n\r\nNow, however ludicrous all this may appear to some, others, I doubt\r\nnot, will feel and acknowledge the truth of it; nay, may, perhaps,\r\nthink I have not treated the subject with decent solemnity; but surely\r\na man may speak truth with a smiling countenance. In reality, to\r\ndepreciate a book maliciously, or even wantonly, is at least a very\r\nill-natured office; and a morose snarling critic may, I believe, be\r\nsuspected to be a bad man.\r\n\r\nI will therefore endeavour, in the remaining part of this chapter, to\r\nexplain the marks of this character, and to show what criticism I here\r\nintend to obviate: for I can never be understood, unless by the very\r\npersons here meant, to insinuate that there are no proper judges of\r\nwriting, or to endeavour to exclude from the commonwealth of\r\nliterature any of those noble critics to whose labours the learned\r\nworld are so greatly indebted. Such were Aristotle, Horace, and\r\nLonginus, among the antients, Dacier and Bossu among the French, and\r\nsome perhaps among us; who have certainly been duly authorised to\r\nexecute at least a judicial authority _in foro literario_.\r\n\r\nBut without ascertaining all the proper qualifications of a critic,\r\nwhich I have touched on elsewhere, I think I may very boldly object to\r\nthe censures of any one past upon works which he hath not himself\r\nread. Such censurers as these, whether they speak from their own guess\r\nor suspicion, or from the report and opinion of others, may properly\r\nbe said to slander the reputation of the book they condemn.\r\n\r\nSuch may likewise be suspected of deserving this character, who,\r\nwithout assigning any particular faults, condemn the whole in general\r\ndefamatory terms; such as vile, dull, d--d stuff, &c., and\r\nparticularly by the use of the monosyllable low; a word which becomes\r\nthe mouth of no critic who is not RIGHT HONOURABLE.\r\n\r\nAgain, though there may be some faults justly assigned in the work,\r\nyet, if those are not in the most essential parts, or if they are\r\ncompensated by greater beauties, it will savour rather of the malice\r\nof a slanderer than of the judgment of a true critic to pass a severe\r\nsentence upon the whole, merely on account of some vicious part. This\r\nis directly contrary to the sentiments of Horace:\r\n\r\n _Verum ubi plura nitent in carmine, non ego paucis\r\n Offendor maculis, quas aut incuria fudit,\r\n Aut humana parum cavit natura----_\r\n\r\n But where the beauties, more in number, shine,\r\n I am not angry, when a casual line\r\n (That with some trivial faults unequal flows)\r\n A careless hand or human frailty shows.--MR FRANCIS.\r\n\r\nFor, as Martial says, _Aliter non fit, Avite, liber_. No book can be\r\notherwise composed. All beauty of character, as well as of\r\ncountenance, and indeed of everything human, is to be tried in this\r\nmanner. Cruel indeed would it be if such a work as this history, which\r\nhath employed some thousands of hours in the composing, should be\r\nliable to be condemned, because some particular chapter, or perhaps\r\nchapters, may be obnoxious to very just and sensible objections. And\r\nyet nothing is more common than the most rigorous sentence upon books\r\nsupported by such objections, which, if they were rightly taken (and\r\nthat they are not always), do by no means go to the merit of the\r\nwhole. In the theatre especially, a single expression which doth not\r\ncoincide with the taste of the audience, or with any individual critic\r\nof that audience, is sure to be hissed; and one scene which should be\r\ndisapproved would hazard the whole piece. To write within such severe\r\nrules as these is as impossible as to live up to some splenetic\r\nopinions: and if we judge according to the sentiments of some critics,\r\nand of some Christians, no author will be saved in this world, and no\r\nman in the next."

      "title": "Chapter ii.",
      "content": "The adventures which Sophia met with after her leaving Upton.\r\n\nOur history, just before it was obliged to turn about and travel\r\nbackwards, had mentioned the departure of Sophia and her maid from the\r\ninn; we shall now therefore pursue the steps of that lovely creature,\r\nand leave her unworthy lover a little longer to bemoan his ill-luck,\r\nor rather his ill-conduct.\r\n\r\nSophia having directed her guide to travel through bye-roads, across\r\nthe country, they now passed the Severn, and had scarce got a mile\r\nfrom the inn, when the young lady, looking behind her, saw several\r\nhorses coming after on full speed. This greatly alarmed her fears, and\r\nshe called to the guide to put on as fast as possible.\r\n\r\nHe immediately obeyed her, and away they rode a full gallop. But the\r\nfaster they went, the faster were they followed; and as the horses\r\nbehind were somewhat swifter than those before, so the former were at\r\nlength overtaken. A happy circumstance for poor Sophia; whose fears,\r\njoined to her fatigue, had almost overpowered her spirits; but she was\r\nnow instantly relieved by a female voice, that greeted her in the\r\nsoftest manner, and with the utmost civility. This greeting Sophia, as\r\nsoon as she could recover her breath, with like civility, and with the\r\nhighest satisfaction to herself, returned.\r\n\r\nThe travellers who joined Sophia, and who had given her such terror,\r\nconsisted, like her own company, of two females and a guide. The two\r\nparties proceeded three full miles together before any one offered\r\nagain to open their mouths; when our heroine, having pretty well got\r\nthe better of her fear (but yet being somewhat surprized that the\r\nother still continued to attend her, as she pursued no great road, and\r\nhad already passed through several turnings), accosted the strange\r\nlady in a most obliging tone, and said, “She was very happy to find\r\nthey were both travelling the same way.” The other, who, like a ghost,\r\nonly wanted to be spoke to, readily answered, “That the happiness was\r\nentirely hers; that she was a perfect stranger in that country, and\r\nwas so overjoyed at meeting a companion of her own sex, that she had\r\nperhaps been guilty of an impertinence, which required great apology,\r\nin keeping pace with her.” More civilities passed between these two\r\nladies; for Mrs Honour had now given place to the fine habit of the\r\nstranger, and had fallen into the rear. But, though Sophia had great\r\ncuriosity to know why the other lady continued to travel on through\r\nthe same bye-roads with herself, nay, though this gave her some\r\nuneasiness, yet fear, or modesty, or some other consideration,\r\nrestrained her from asking the question.\r\n\r\nThe strange lady now laboured under a difficulty which appears almost\r\nbelow the dignity of history to mention. Her bonnet had been blown\r\nfrom her head not less than five times within the last mile; nor could\r\nshe come at any ribbon or handkerchief to tie it under her chin. When\r\nSophia was informed of this, she immediately supplied her with a\r\nhandkerchief for this purpose; which while she was pulling from her\r\npocket, she perhaps too much neglected the management of her horse,\r\nfor the beast, now unluckily making a false step, fell upon his\r\nfore-legs, and threw his fair rider from his back.\r\n\r\nThough Sophia came head foremost to the ground, she happily received\r\nnot the least damage: and the same circumstances which had perhaps\r\ncontributed to her fall now preserved her from confusion; for the lane\r\nwhich they were then passing was narrow, and very much overgrown with\r\ntrees, so that the moon could here afford very little light, and was\r\nmoreover, at present, so obscured in a cloud, that it was almost\r\nperfectly dark. By these means the young lady's modesty, which was\r\nextremely delicate, escaped as free from injury as her limbs, and she\r\nwas once more reinstated in her saddle, having received no other harm\r\nthan a little fright by her fall.\r\n\r\nDaylight at length appeared in its full lustre; and now the two\r\nladies, who were riding over a common side by side, looking stedfastly\r\nat each other, at the same moment both their eyes became fixed; both\r\ntheir horses stopt, and, both speaking together, with equal joy\r\npronounced, the one the name of Sophia, the other that of Harriet.\r\n\r\nThis unexpected encounter surprized the ladies much more than I\r\nbelieve it will the sagacious reader, who must have imagined that the\r\nstrange lady could be no other than Mrs Fitzpatrick, the cousin of\r\nMiss Western, whom we before mentioned to have sallied from the inn a\r\nfew minutes after her.\r\n\r\nSo great was the surprize and joy which these two cousins conceived at\r\nthis meeting (for they had formerly been most intimate acquaintance\r\nand friends, and had long lived together with their aunt Western),\r\nthat it is impossible to recount half the congratulations which passed\r\nbetween them, before either asked a very natural question of the\r\nother, namely, whither she was going?\r\n\r\nThis at last, however, came first from Mrs Fitzpatrick; but, easy and\r\nnatural as the question may seem, Sophia found it difficult to give it\r\na very ready and certain answer. She begged her cousin therefore to\r\nsuspend all curiosity till they arrived at some inn, “which I\r\nsuppose,” says she, “can hardly be far distant; and, believe me,\r\nHarriet, I suspend as much curiosity on my side; for, indeed, I\r\nbelieve our astonishment is pretty equal.”\r\n\r\nThe conversation which passed between these ladies on the road was, I\r\napprehend, little worth relating; and less certainly was that between\r\nthe two waiting-women; for they likewise began to pay their\r\ncompliments to each other. As for the guides, they were debarred from\r\nthe pleasure of discourse, the one being placed in the van, and the\r\nother obliged to bring up the rear.\r\n\r\nIn this posture they travelled many hours, till they came into a wide\r\nand well-beaten road, which, as they turned to the right, soon brought\r\nthem to a very fair promising inn, where they all alighted: but so\r\nfatigued was Sophia, that as she had sat her horse during the last\r\nfive or six miles with great difficulty, so was she now incapable of\r\ndismounting from him without assistance. This the landlord, who had\r\nhold of her horse, presently perceiving, offered to lift her in his\r\narms from her saddle; and she too readily accepted the tender of his\r\nservice. Indeed fortune seems to have resolved to put Sophia to the\r\nblush that day, and the second malicious attempt succeeded better than\r\nthe first; for my landlord had no sooner received the young lady in\r\nhis arms, than his feet, which the gout had lately very severely\r\nhandled, gave way, and down he tumbled; but, at the same time, with no\r\nless dexterity than gallantry, contrived to throw himself under his\r\ncharming burden, so that he alone received any bruise from the fall;\r\nfor the great injury which happened to Sophia was a violent shock\r\ngiven to her modesty by an immoderate grin, which, at her rising from\r\nthe ground, she observed in the countenances of most of the\r\nbye-standers. This made her suspect what had really happened, and what\r\nwe shall not here relate for the indulgence of those readers who are\r\ncapable of laughing at the offence given to a young lady's delicacy.\r\nAccidents of this kind we have never regarded in a comical light; nor\r\nwill we scruple to say that he must have a very inadequate idea of the\r\nmodesty of a beautiful young woman, who would wish to sacrifice it to\r\nso paltry a satisfaction as can arise from laughter.\r\n\r\nThis fright and shock, joined to the violent fatigue which both her\r\nmind and body had undergone, almost overcame the excellent\r\nconstitution of Sophia, and she had scarce strength sufficient to\r\ntotter into the inn, leaning on the arm of her maid. Here she was no\r\nsooner seated than she called for a glass of water; but Mrs Honour,\r\nvery judiciously, in my opinion, changed it into a glass of wine.\r\n\r\nMrs Fitzpatrick, hearing from Mrs Honour that Sophia had not been in\r\nbed during the two last nights, and observing her to look very pale\r\nand wan with her fatigue, earnestly entreated her to refresh herself\r\nwith some sleep. She was yet a stranger to her history, or her\r\napprehensions; but, had she known both, she would have given the same\r\nadvice; for rest was visibly necessary for her; and their long journey\r\nthrough bye-roads so entirely removed all danger of pursuit, that she\r\nwas herself perfectly easy on that account.\r\n\r\nSophia was easily prevailed on to follow the counsel of her friend,\r\nwhich was heartily seconded by her maid. Mrs Fitzpatrick likewise\r\noffered to bear her cousin company, which Sophia, with much\r\ncomplacence, accepted.\r\n\r\nThe mistress was no sooner in bed than the maid prepared to follow her\r\nexample. She began to make many apologies to her sister Abigail for\r\nleaving her alone in so horrid a place as an inn; but the other stopt\r\nher short, being as well inclined to a nap as herself, and desired the\r\nhonour of being her bedfellow. Sophia's maid agreed to give her a\r\nshare of her bed, but put in her claim to all the honour. So, after\r\nmany courtsies and compliments, to bed together went the\r\nwaiting-women, as their mistresses had done before them.\r\n\r\nIt was usual with my landlord (as indeed it is with the whole\r\nfraternity) to enquire particularly of all coachmen, footmen,\r\npostboys, and others, into the names of all his guests; what their\r\nestate was, and where it lay. It cannot therefore be wondered at that\r\nthe many particular circumstances which attended our travellers, and\r\nespecially their retiring all to sleep at so extraordinary and unusual\r\nan hour as ten in the morning, should excite his curiosity. As soon,\r\ntherefore, as the guides entered the kitchen, he began to examine who\r\nthe ladies were, and whence they came; but the guides, though they\r\nfaithfully related all they knew, gave him very little satisfaction.\r\nOn the contrary, they rather enflamed his curiosity than extinguished\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThis landlord had the character, among all his neighbours, of being a\r\nvery sagacious fellow. He was thought to see farther and deeper into\r\nthings than any man in the parish, the parson himself not excepted.\r\nPerhaps his look had contributed not a little to procure him this\r\nreputation; for there was in this something wonderfully wise and\r\nsignificant, especially when he had a pipe in his mouth; which,\r\nindeed, he seldom was without. His behaviour, likewise, greatly\r\nassisted in promoting the opinion of his wisdom. In his deportment he\r\nwas solemn, if not sullen; and when he spoke, which was seldom, he\r\nalways delivered himself in a slow voice; and, though his sentences\r\nwere short, they were still interrupted with many hums and ha's, ay\r\nays, and other expletives: so that, though he accompanied his words\r\nwith certain explanatory gestures, such as shaking or nodding the\r\nhead, or pointing with his fore-finger, he generally left his hearers\r\nto understand more than he expressed; nay, he commonly gave them a\r\nhint that he knew much more than he thought proper to disclose. This\r\nlast circumstance alone may, indeed, very well account for his\r\ncharacter of wisdom; since men are strangely inclined to worship what\r\nthey do not understand. A grand secret, upon which several imposers on\r\nmankind have totally relied for the success of their frauds.\r\n\r\nThis polite person, now taking his wife aside, asked her “what she\r\nthought of the ladies lately arrived?” “Think of them?” said the wife,\r\n“why, what should I think of them?” “I know,” answered he, “what I\r\nthink. The guides tell strange stories. One pretends to be come from\r\nGloucester, and the other from Upton; and neither of them, for what I\r\ncan find, can tell whither they are going. But what people ever travel\r\nacross the country from Upton hither, especially to London? And one of\r\nthe maid-servants, before she alighted from her horse, asked if this\r\nwas not the London road? Now I have put all these circumstances\r\ntogether, and whom do you think I have found them out to be?” “Nay,”\r\n answered she, “you know I never pretend to guess at your\r\ndiscoveries.”----“It is a good girl,” replied he, chucking her under\r\nthe chin; “I must own you have always submitted to my knowledge of\r\nthese matters. Why, then, depend upon it; mind what I say--depend upon\r\nit, they are certainly some of the rebel ladies, who, they say, travel\r\nwith the young Chevalier; and have taken a roundabout way to escape\r\nthe duke's army.”\r\n\r\n“Husband,” quoth the wife, “you have certainly hit it; for one of them\r\nis dressed as fine as any princess; and, to be sure, she looks for all\r\nthe world like one.----But yet, when I consider one thing”----“When\r\nyou consider,” cries the landlord contemptuously----“Come, pray let's\r\nhear what you consider.”----“Why, it is,” answered the wife, “that she\r\nis too humble to be any very great lady: for, while our Betty was\r\nwarming the bed, she called her nothing but child, and my dear, and\r\nsweetheart; and, when Betty offered to pull off her shoes and\r\nstockings, she would not suffer her, saying, she would not give her\r\nthe trouble.”\r\n\r\n“Pugh!” answered the husband, “that is nothing. Dost think, because\r\nyou have seen some great ladies rude and uncivil to persons below\r\nthem, that none of them know how to behave themselves when they come\r\nbefore their inferiors? I think I know people of fashion when I see\r\nthem--I think I do. Did not she call for a glass of water when she\r\ncame in? Another sort of women would have called for a dram; you know\r\nthey would. If she be not a woman of very great quality, sell me for a\r\nfool; and, I believe, those who buy me will have a bad bargain. Now,\r\nwould a woman of her quality travel without a footman, unless upon\r\nsome such extraordinary occasion?” “Nay, to be sure, husband,” cries\r\nshe, “you know these matters better than I, or most folk.” “I think I\r\ndo know something,” said he. “To be sure,” answered the wife, “the\r\npoor little heart looked so piteous, when she sat down in the chair, I\r\nprotest I could not help having a compassion for her almost as much as\r\nif she had been a poor body. But what's to be done, husband? If an she\r\nbe a rebel, I suppose you intend to betray her up to the court. Well,\r\nshe's a sweet-tempered, good-humoured lady, be she what she will, and\r\nI shall hardly refrain from crying when I hear she is hanged or\r\nbeheaded.” “Pooh!” answered the husband.----“But, as to what's to be\r\ndone, it is not so easy a matter to determine. I hope, before she goes\r\naway, we shall have the news of a battle; for, if the Chevalier should\r\nget the better, she may gain us interest at court, and make our\r\nfortunes without betraying her.” “Why, that's true,” replied the wife;\r\n“and I heartily hope she will have it in her power. Certainly she's a\r\nsweet good lady; it would go horribly against me to have her come to\r\nany harm.” “Pooh!” cries the landlord, “women are always so\r\ntender-hearted. Why, you would not harbour rebels, would you?” “No,\r\ncertainly,” answered the wife; “and as for betraying her, come what\r\nwill on't, nobody can blame us. It is what anybody would do in our\r\ncase.”\r\n\r\nWhile our politic landlord, who had not, we see, undeservedly the\r\nreputation of great wisdom among his neighbours, was engaged in\r\ndebating this matter with himself (for he paid little attention to the\r\nopinion of his wife), news arrived that the rebels had given the duke\r\nthe slip, and had got a day's march towards London; and soon after\r\narrived a famous Jacobite squire, who, with great joy in his\r\ncountenance, shook the landlord by the hand, saying, “All's our own,\r\nboy, ten thousand honest Frenchmen are landed in Suffolk. Old England\r\nfor ever! ten thousand French, my brave lad! I am going to tap away\r\ndirectly.”\r\n\r\nThis news determined the opinion of the wise man, and he resolved to\r\nmake his court to the young lady when she arose; for he had now (he\r\nsaid) discovered that she was no other than Madam Jenny Cameron\r\nherself."

      "content": "A very short chapter, in which however is a sun, a moon, a star, and\r\nan angel.\r\n\nThe sun (for he keeps very good hours at this time of the year) had\r\nbeen some time retired to rest when Sophia arose greatly refreshed by\r\nher sleep; which, short as it was, nothing but her extreme fatigue\r\ncould have occasioned; for, though she had told her maid, and perhaps\r\nherself too, that she was perfectly easy when she left Upton, yet it\r\nis certain her mind was a little affected with that malady which is\r\nattended with all the restless symptoms of a fever, and is perhaps the\r\nvery distemper which physicians mean (if they mean anything) by the\r\nfever on the spirits.\r\n\r\nMrs Fitzpatrick likewise left her bed at the same time; and, having\r\nsummoned her maid, immediately dressed herself. She was really a very\r\npretty woman, and, had she been in any other company but that of\r\nSophia, might have been thought beautiful; but when Mrs Honour of her\r\nown accord attended (for her mistress would not suffer her to be\r\nwaked), and had equipped our heroine, the charms of Mrs Fitzpatrick,\r\nwho had performed the office of the morning-star, and had preceded\r\ngreater glories, shared the fate of that star, and were totally\r\neclipsed the moment those glories shone forth.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Sophia never looked more beautiful than she did at this\r\ninstant. We ought not, therefore, to condemn the maid of the inn for\r\nher hyperbole, who, when she descended, after having lighted the fire,\r\ndeclared, and ratified it with an oath, that if ever there was an\r\nangel upon earth, she was now above-stairs.\r\n\r\nSophia had acquainted her cousin with her design to go to London; and\r\nMrs Fitzpatrick had agreed to accompany her; for the arrival of her\r\nhusband at Upton had put an end to her design of going to Bath, or to\r\nher aunt Western. They had therefore no sooner finished their tea than\r\nSophia proposed to set out, the moon then shining extremely bright,\r\nand as for the frost she defied it; nor had she any of those\r\napprehensions which many young ladies would have felt at travelling by\r\nnight; for she had, as we have before observed, some little degree of\r\nnatural courage; and this, her present sensations, which bordered\r\nsomewhat on despair, greatly encreased. Besides, as she had already\r\ntravelled twice with safety by the light of the moon, she was the\r\nbetter emboldened to trust to it a third time.\r\n\r\nThe disposition of Mrs Fitzpatrick was more timorous; for, though the\r\ngreater terrors had conquered the less, and the presence of her\r\nhusband had driven her away at so unseasonable an hour from Upton,\r\nyet, being now arrived at a place where she thought herself safe from\r\nhis pursuit, these lesser terrors of I know not what operated so\r\nstrongly, that she earnestly entreated her cousin to stay till the\r\nnext morning, and not expose herself to the dangers of travelling by\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nSophia, who was yielding to an excess, when she could neither laugh\r\nnor reason her cousin out of these apprehensions, at last gave way to\r\nthem. Perhaps, indeed, had she known of her father's arrival at Upton,\r\nit might have been more difficult to have persuaded her; for as to\r\nJones, she had, I am afraid, no great horror at the thoughts of being\r\novertaken by him; nay, to confess the truth, I believe she rather\r\nwished than feared it; though I might honestly enough have concealed\r\nthis wish from the reader, as it was one of those secret spontaneous\r\nemotions of the soul to which the reason is often a stranger.\r\n\r\nWhen our young ladies had determined to remain all that evening in\r\ntheir inn they were attended by the landlady, who desired to know what\r\ntheir ladyships would be pleased to eat. Such charms were there in the\r\nvoice, in the manner, and in the affable deportment of Sophia, that\r\nshe ravished the landlady to the highest degree; and that good woman,\r\nconcluding that she had attended Jenny Cameron, became in a moment a\r\nstanch Jacobite, and wished heartily well to the young Pretender's\r\ncause, from the great sweetness and affability with which she had been\r\ntreated by his supposed mistress.\r\n\r\nThe two cousins began now to impart to each other their reciprocal\r\ncuriosity to know what extraordinary accidents on both sides\r\noccasioned this so strange and unexpected meeting. At last Mrs\r\nFitzpatrick, having obtained of Sophia a promise of communicating\r\nlikewise in her turn, began to relate what the reader, if he is\r\ndesirous to know her history, may read in the ensuing chapter."

      "title": "Chapter iv.",
      "content": "The history of Mrs Fitzpatrick.\r\n\nMrs Fitzpatrick, after a silence of a few moments, fetching a deep\r\nsigh, thus began:\r\n\r\n“It is natural to the unhappy to feel a secret concern in recollecting\r\nthose periods of their lives which have been most delightful to them.\r\nThe remembrance of past pleasures affects us with a kind of tender\r\ngrief, like what we suffer for departed friends; and the ideas of both\r\nmay be said to haunt our imaginations.\r\n\r\n“For this reason, I never reflect without sorrow on those days (the\r\nhappiest far of my life) which we spent together when both were under\r\nthe care of my aunt Western. Alas! why are Miss Graveairs and Miss\r\nGiddy no more? You remember, I am sure, when we knew each other by no\r\nother names. Indeed, you gave the latter appellation with too much\r\ncause. I have since experienced how much I deserved it. You, my\r\nSophia, was always my superior in everything, and I heartily hope you\r\nwill be so in your fortune. I shall never forget the wise and matronly\r\nadvice you once gave me, when I lamented being disappointed of a ball,\r\nthough you could not be then fourteen years old.----O my Sophy, how\r\nblest must have been my situation, when I could think such a\r\ndisappointment a misfortune; and when indeed it was the greatest I had\r\never known!”\r\n\r\n“And yet, my dear Harriet,” answered Sophia, “it was then a serious\r\nmatter with you. Comfort yourself therefore with thinking, that\r\nwhatever you now lament may hereafter appear as trifling and\r\ncontemptible as a ball would at this time.”\r\n\r\n“Alas, my Sophia,” replied the other lady, “you yourself will think\r\notherwise of my present situation; for greatly must that tender heart\r\nbe altered if my misfortunes do not draw many a sigh, nay, many a\r\ntear, from you. The knowledge of this should perhaps deter me from\r\nrelating what I am convinced will so much affect you.” Here Mrs\r\nFitzpatrick stopt, till, at the repeated entreaties of Sophia, she\r\nthus proceeded:\r\n\r\n“Though you must have heard much of my marriage; yet, as matters may\r\nprobably have been misrepresented, I will set out from the very\r\ncommencement of my unfortunate acquaintance with my present husband;\r\nwhich was at Bath, soon after you left my aunt, and returned home to\r\nyour father.\r\n\r\n“Among the gay young fellows who were at this season at Bath, Mr\r\nFitzpatrick was one. He was handsome, _dégagé,_ extremely gallant, and\r\nin his dress exceeded most others. In short, my dear, if you was\r\nunluckily to see him now, I could describe him no better than by\r\ntelling you he was the very reverse of everything which he is: for he\r\nhath rusticated himself so long, that he is become an absolute wild\r\nIrishman. But to proceed in my story: the qualifications which he then\r\npossessed so well recommended him, that, though the people of quality\r\nat that time lived separate from the rest of the company, and excluded\r\nthem from all their parties, Mr Fitzpatrick found means to gain\r\nadmittance. It was perhaps no easy matter to avoid him; for he\r\nrequired very little or no invitation; and as, being handsome and\r\ngenteel, he found it no very difficult matter to ingratiate himself\r\nwith the ladies, so, he having frequently drawn his sword, the men did\r\nnot care publickly to affront him. Had it not been for some such\r\nreason, I believe he would have been soon expelled by his own sex; for\r\nsurely he had no strict title to be preferred to the English gentry;\r\nnor did they seem inclined to show him any extraordinary favour. They\r\nall abused him behind his back, which might probably proceed from\r\nenvy; for by the women he was well received, and very particularly\r\ndistinguished by them.\r\n\r\n“My aunt, though no person of quality herself, as she had always lived\r\nabout the court, was enrolled in that party; for, by whatever means\r\nyou get into the polite circle, when you are once there, it is\r\nsufficient merit for you that you are there. This observation, young\r\nas you was, you could scarce avoid making from my aunt, who was free,\r\nor reserved, with all people, just as they had more or less of this\r\nmerit.\r\n\r\n“And this merit, I believe, it was, which principally recommended Mr\r\nFitzpatrick to her favour. In which he so well succeeded, that he was\r\nalways one of her private parties. Nor was he backward in returning\r\nsuch distinction; for he soon grew so very particular in his behaviour\r\nto her, that the scandal club first began to take notice of it, and\r\nthe better-disposed persons made a match between them. For my own\r\npart, I confess, I made no doubt but that his designs were strictly\r\nhonourable, as the phrase is; that is, to rob a lady of her fortune by\r\nway of marriage. My aunt was, I conceived, neither young enough nor\r\nhandsome enough to attract much wicked inclination; but she had\r\nmatrimonial charms in great abundance.\r\n\r\n“I was the more confirmed in this opinion from the extraordinary\r\nrespect which he showed to myself from the first moment of our\r\nacquaintance. This I understood as an attempt to lessen, if possible,\r\nthat disinclination which my interest might be supposed to give me\r\ntowards the match; and I know not but in some measure it had that\r\neffect; for, as I was well contented with my own fortune, and of all\r\npeople the least a slave to interested views, so I could not be\r\nviolently the enemy of a man with whose behaviour to me I was greatly\r\npleased; and the more so, as I was the only object of such respect;\r\nfor he behaved at the same time to many women of quality without any\r\nrespect at all.\r\n\r\n“Agreeable as this was to me, he soon changed it into another kind of\r\nbehaviour, which was perhaps more so. He now put on much softness and\r\ntenderness, and languished and sighed abundantly. At times, indeed,\r\nwhether from art or nature I will not determine, he gave his usual\r\nloose to gaiety and mirth; but this was always in general company, and\r\nwith other women; for even in a country-dance, when he was not my\r\npartner, he became grave, and put on the softest look imaginable the\r\nmoment he approached me. Indeed he was in all things so very\r\nparticular towards me, that I must have been blind not to have\r\ndiscovered it. And, and, and----” “And you was more pleased still, my\r\ndear Harriet,” cries Sophia; “you need not be ashamed,” added she,\r\nsighing; “for sure there are irresistible charms in tenderness, which\r\ntoo many men are able to affect.” “True,” answered her cousin; “men,\r\nwho in all other instances want common sense, are very Machiavels in\r\nthe art of loving. I wish I did not know an instance.--Well, scandal\r\nnow began to be as busy with me as it had before been with my aunt;\r\nand some good ladies did not scruple to affirm that Mr Fitzpatrick had\r\nan intrigue with us both.\r\n\r\n“But, what may seem astonishing, my aunt never saw, nor in the least\r\nseemed to suspect, that which was visible enough, I believe, from both\r\nour behaviours. One would indeed think that love quite puts out the\r\neyes of an old woman. In fact, they so greedily swallow the addresses\r\nwhich are made to them, that, like an outrageous glutton, they are not\r\nat leisure to observe what passes amongst others at the same table.\r\nThis I have observed in more cases than my own; and this was so\r\nstrongly verified by my aunt, that, though she often found us together\r\nat her return from the pump, the least canting word of his, pretending\r\nimpatience at her absence, effectually smothered all suspicion. One\r\nartifice succeeded with her to admiration. This was his treating me\r\nlike a little child, and never calling me by any other name in her\r\npresence but that of pretty miss. This indeed did him some disservice\r\nwith your humble servant; but I soon saw through it, especially as in\r\nher absence he behaved to me, as I have said, in a different manner.\r\nHowever, if I was not greatly disobliged by a conduct of which I had\r\ndiscovered the design, I smarted very severely for it; for my aunt\r\nreally conceived me to be what her lover (as she thought him) called\r\nme, and treated me in all respects as a perfect infant. To say the\r\ntruth, I wonder she had not insisted on my again wearing\r\nleading-strings.\r\n\r\n“At last, my lover (for so he was) thought proper, in a most solemn\r\nmanner, to disclose a secret which I had known long before. He now\r\nplaced all the love which he had pretended to my aunt to my account.\r\nHe lamented, in very pathetic terms, the encouragement she had given\r\nhim, and made a high merit of the tedious hours in which he had\r\nundergone her conversation.--What shall I tell you, my dear\r\nSophia?--Then I will confess the truth. I was pleased with my man. I\r\nwas pleased with my conquest. To rival my aunt delighted me; to rival\r\nso many other women charmed me. In short, I am afraid I did not behave\r\nas I should do, even upon the very first declaration--I wish I did not\r\nalmost give him positive encouragement before we parted.\r\n\r\n“The Bath now talked loudly--I might almost say, roared against me.\r\nSeveral young women affected to shun my acquaintance, not so much,\r\nperhaps, from any real suspicion, as from a desire of banishing me\r\nfrom a company in which I too much engrossed their favourite man. And\r\nhere I cannot omit expressing my gratitude to the kindness intended me\r\nby Mr Nash, who took me one day aside, and gave me advice, which if I\r\nhad followed, I had been a happy woman. `Child,' says he, `I am sorry\r\nto see the familiarity which subsists between you and a fellow who is\r\naltogether unworthy of you, and I am afraid will prove your ruin. As\r\nfor your old stinking aunt, if it was to be no injury to you and my\r\npretty Sophy Western (I assure you I repeat his words), I should be\r\nheartily glad that the fellow was in possession of all that belongs to\r\nher. I never advise old women: for, if they take it into their heads\r\nto go to the devil, it is no more possible than worth while to keep\r\nthem from him. Innocence and youth and beauty are worthy a better\r\nfate, and I would save them from his clutches. Let me advise you\r\ntherefore, dear child, never suffer this fellow to be particular with\r\nyou again.' Many more things he said to me, which I have now\r\nforgotten, and indeed I attended very little to them at the time; for\r\ninclination contradicted all he said; and, besides, I could not be\r\npersuaded that women of quality would condescend to familiarity with\r\nsuch a person as he described.\r\n\r\n“But I am afraid, my dear, I shall tire you with a detail of so many\r\nminute circumstances. To be concise, therefore, imagine me married;\r\nimagine me with my husband, at the feet of my aunt; and then imagine\r\nthe maddest woman in Bedlam, in a raving fit, and your imagination\r\nwill suggest to you no more than what really happened.\r\n\r\n“The very next day my aunt left the place, partly to avoid seeing Mr\r\nFitzpatrick or myself, and as much perhaps to avoid seeing any one\r\nelse; for, though I am told she hath since denied everything stoutly,\r\nI believe she was then a little confounded at her disappointment.\r\nSince that time, I have written to her many letters, but never could\r\nobtain an answer, which I must own sits somewhat the heavier, as she\r\nherself was, though undesignedly, the occasion of all my sufferings:\r\nfor, had it not been under the colour of paying his addresses to her,\r\nMr Fitzpatrick would never have found sufficient opportunities to have\r\nengaged my heart, which, in other circumstances, I still flatter\r\nmyself would not have been an easy conquest to such a person. Indeed,\r\nI believe I should not have erred so grossly in my choice if I had\r\nrelied on my own judgment; but I trusted totally to the opinion of\r\nothers, and very foolishly took the merit of a man for granted whom I\r\nsaw so universally well received by the women. What is the reason, my\r\ndear, that we, who have understandings equal to the wisest and\r\ngreatest of the other sex, so often make choice of the silliest\r\nfellows for companions and favourites? It raises my indignation to the\r\nhighest pitch to reflect on the numbers of women of sense who have\r\nbeen undone by fools.” Here she paused a moment; but, Sophia making no\r\nanswer, she proceeded as in the next chapter."

      "content": "In which the history of Mrs Fitzpatrick is continued.\r\n\n“We remained at Bath no longer than a fortnight after our wedding; for\r\nas to any reconciliation with my aunt, there were no hopes; and of my\r\nfortune not one farthing could be touched till I was of age, of which\r\nI now wanted more than two years. My husband therefore was resolved to\r\nset out for Ireland; against which I remonstrated very earnestly, and\r\ninsisted on a promise which he had made me before our marriage that I\r\nshould never take this journey against my consent; and indeed I never\r\nintended to consent to it; nor will anybody, I believe, blame me for\r\nthat resolution; but this, however, I never mentioned to my husband,\r\nand petitioned only for the reprieve of a month; but he had fixed the\r\nday, and to that day he obstinately adhered.\r\n\r\n“The evening before our departure, as we were disputing this point\r\nwith great eagerness on both sides, he started suddenly from his\r\nchair, and left me abruptly, saying he was going to the rooms. He was\r\nhardly out of the house when I saw a paper lying on the floor, which,\r\nI suppose, he had carelessly pulled from his pocket, together with his\r\nhandkerchief. This paper I took up, and, finding it to be a letter, I\r\nmade no scruple to open and read it; and indeed I read it so often\r\nthat I can repeat it to you almost word for word. This then was the\r\nletter:\r\n\r\n _'To Mr Brian Fitzpatrick._\r\n\r\n 'SIR,\r\n\r\n 'YOURS received, and am surprized you should use me in this manner,\r\n as have never seen any of your cash, unless for one linsey-woolsey\r\n coat, and your bill now is upwards of £150. Consider, sir, how often\r\n you have fobbed me off with your being shortly to be married to this\r\n lady and t'other lady; but I can neither live on hopes or promises,\r\n nor will my woollen-draper take any such in payment. You tell me you\r\n are secure of having either the aunt or the niece, and that you\r\n might have married the aunt before this, whose jointure you say is\r\n immense, but that you prefer the niece on account of her ready\r\n money. Pray, sir, take a fool's advice for once, and marry the first\r\n you can get. You will pardon my offering my advice, as you know I\r\n sincerely wish you well. Shall draw on you per next post, in favour\r\n of Messieurs John Drugget and company, at fourteen days, which doubt\r\n not your honouring, and am,\r\n\r\n Sir, your humble servant, 'SAM. COSGRAVE.'\r\n\r\n“This was the letter, word for word. Guess, my dear girl--guess how\r\nthis letter affected me. You prefer the niece on account of her ready\r\nmoney! If every one of these words had been a dagger, I could with\r\npleasure have stabbed them into his heart; but I will not recount my\r\nfrantic behaviour on the occasion. I had pretty well spent my tears\r\nbefore his return home; but sufficient remains of them appeared in my\r\nswollen eyes. He threw himself sullenly into his chair, and for a long\r\ntime we were both silent. At length, in a haughty tone, he said, `I\r\nhope, madam, your servants have packed up all your things; for the\r\ncoach will be ready by six in the morning.' My patience was totally\r\nsubdued by this provocation, and I answered, `No, sir, there is a\r\nletter still remains unpacked;' and then throwing it on the table I\r\nfell to upbraiding him with the most bitter language I could invent.\r\n\r\n“Whether guilt, or shame, or prudence, restrained him I cannot say;\r\nbut, though he is the most passionate of men, he exerted no rage on\r\nthis occasion. He endeavoured, on the contrary, to pacify me by the\r\nmost gentle means. He swore the phrase in the letter to which I\r\nprincipally objected was not his, nor had he ever written any such. He\r\nowned, indeed, the having mentioned his marriage, and that preference\r\nwhich he had given to myself, but denied with many oaths the having\r\nmentioned any such matter at all on account of the straits he was in\r\nfor money, arising, he said, from his having too long neglected his\r\nestate in Ireland. And this, he said, which he could not bear to\r\ndiscover to me, was the only reason of his having so strenuously\r\ninsisted on our journey. He then used several very endearing\r\nexpressions, and concluded by a very fond caress, and many violent\r\nprotestations of love.\r\n\r\n“There was one circumstance which, though he did not appeal to it, had\r\nmuch weight with me in his favour, and that was the word jointure in\r\nthe taylor's letter, whereas my aunt never had been married, and this\r\nMr Fitzpatrick well knew.----As I imagined, therefore, that the fellow\r\nmust have inserted this of his own head, or from hearsay, I persuaded\r\nmyself he might have ventured likewise on that odious line on no\r\nbetter authority. What reasoning was this, my dear? was I not an\r\nadvocate rather than a judge?--But why do I mention such a\r\ncircumstance as this, or appeal to it for the justification of my\r\nforgiveness?--In short, had he been guilty of twenty times as much,\r\nhalf the tenderness and fondness which he used would have prevailed on\r\nme to have forgiven him. I now made no farther objections to our\r\nsetting out, which we did the next morning, and in a little more than\r\na week arrived at the seat of Mr Fitzpatrick.\r\n\r\n“Your curiosity will excuse me from relating any occurrences which\r\npast during our journey; for it would indeed be highly disagreeable to\r\ntravel it over again, and no less so to you to travel it over with me.\r\n\r\n“This seat, then, is an ancient mansion-house: if I was in one of\r\nthose merry humours in which you have so often seen me, I could\r\ndescribe it to you ridiculously enough. It looked as if it had been\r\nformerly inhabited by a gentleman. Here was room enough, and not the\r\nless room on account of the furniture; for indeed there was very\r\nlittle in it. An old woman, who seemed coeval with the building, and\r\ngreatly resembled her whom Chamont mentions in the Orphan, received us\r\nat the gate, and in a howl scarce human, and to me unintelligible,\r\nwelcomed her master home. In short, the whole scene was so gloomy and\r\nmelancholy, that it threw my spirits into the lowest dejection; which\r\nmy husband discerning, instead of relieving, encreased by two or three\r\nmalicious observations. `There are good houses, madam,' says he, `as\r\nyou find, in other places besides England; but perhaps you had rather\r\nbe in a dirty lodgings at Bath.'\r\n\r\n“Happy, my dear, is the woman who, in any state of life, hath a\r\ncheerful good-natured companion to support and comfort her! But why do\r\nI reflect on happy situations only to aggravate my own misery? my\r\ncompanion, far from clearing up the gloom of solitude, soon convinced\r\nme that I must have been wretched with him in any place, and in any\r\ncondition. In a word, he was a surly fellow, a character perhaps you\r\nhave never seen; for, indeed, no woman ever sees it exemplified but in\r\na father, a brother, or a husband; and, though you have a father, he\r\nis not of that character. This surly fellow had formerly appeared to\r\nme the very reverse, and so he did still to every other person. Good\r\nheaven! how is it possible for a man to maintain a constant lie in his\r\nappearance abroad and in company, and to content himself with shewing\r\ndisagreeable truth only at home? Here, my dear, they make themselves\r\namends for the uneasy restraint which they put on their tempers in the\r\nworld; for I have observed, the more merry and gay and good-humoured\r\nmy husband hath at any time been in company, the more sullen and\r\nmorose he was sure to become at our next private meeting. How shall I\r\ndescribe his barbarity? To my fondness he was cold and insensible. My\r\nlittle comical ways, which you, my Sophy, and which others, have\r\ncalled so agreeable, he treated with contempt. In my most serious\r\nmoments he sung and whistled; and whenever I was thoroughly dejected\r\nand miserable he was angry, and abused me: for, though he was never\r\npleased with my good-humour, nor ascribed it to my satisfaction in\r\nhim, yet my low spirits always offended him, and those he imputed to\r\nmy repentance of having (as he said) married an Irishman.\r\n\r\n“You will easily conceive, my dear Graveairs (I ask your pardon, I\r\nreally forgot myself), that, when a woman makes an imprudent match in\r\nthe sense of the world, that is, when she is not an arrant prostitute\r\nto pecuniary interest, she must necessarily have some inclination and\r\naffection for her man. You will as easily believe that this affection\r\nmay possibly be lessened; nay, I do assure you, contempt will wholly\r\neradicate it. This contempt I now began to entertain for my husband,\r\nwhom I now discovered to be--I must use the expression--an arrant\r\nblockhead. Perhaps you will wonder I did not make this discovery long\r\nbefore; but women will suggest a thousand excuses to themselves for\r\nthe folly of those they like: besides, give me leave to tell you, it\r\nrequires a most penetrating eye to discern a fool through the\r\ndisguises of gaiety and good breeding.\r\n\r\n“It will be easily imagined that, when I once despised my husband, as\r\nI confess to you I soon did, I must consequently dislike his company;\r\nand indeed I had the happiness of being very little troubled with it;\r\nfor our house was now most elegantly furnished, our cellars well\r\nstocked, and dogs and horses provided in great abundance. As my\r\ngentleman therefore entertained his neighbours with great hospitality,\r\nso his neighbours resorted to him with great alacrity; and sports and\r\ndrinking consumed so much of his time, that a small part of his\r\nconversation, that is to say, of his ill-humours, fell to my share.\r\n\r\n“Happy would it have been for me if I could as easily have avoided all\r\nother disagreeable company; but, alas! I was confined to some which\r\nconstantly tormented me; and the more, as I saw no prospect of being\r\nrelieved from them. These companions were my own racking thoughts,\r\nwhich plagued and in a manner haunted me night and day. In this\r\nsituation I past through a scene, the horrors of which can neither be\r\npainted nor imagined. Think, my dear, figure, if you can, to yourself,\r\nwhat I must have undergone. I became a mother by the man I scorned,\r\nhated, and detested. I went through all the agonies and miseries of a\r\nlying-in (ten times more painful in such a circumstance than the worst\r\nlabour can be when one endures it for a man one loves) in a desert, or\r\nrather, indeed, a scene of riot and revel, without a friend, without a\r\ncompanion, or without any of those agreeable circumstances which often\r\nalleviate, and perhaps sometimes more than compensate, the sufferings\r\nof our sex at that season.”"

      "content": "In which the mistake of the landlord throws Sophia into a dreadful\r\nconsternation.\r\n\nMrs Fitzpatrick was proceeding in her narrative when she was\r\ninterrupted by the entrance of dinner, greatly to the concern of\r\nSophia; for the misfortunes of her friend had raised her anxiety, and\r\nleft her no appetite but what Mrs Fitzpatrick was to satisfy by her\r\nrelation.\r\n\r\nThe landlord now attended with a plate under his arm, and with the\r\nsame respect in his countenance and address which he would have put on\r\nhad the ladies arrived in a coach and six.\r\n\r\nThe married lady seemed less affected with her own misfortunes than\r\nwas her cousin; for the former eat very heartily, whereas the latter\r\ncould hardly swallow a morsel. Sophia likewise showed more concern and\r\nsorrow in her countenance than appeared in the other lady; who, having\r\nobserved these symptoms in her friend, begged her to be comforted,\r\nsaying, “Perhaps all may yet end better than either you or I expect.”\r\n\r\nOur landlord thought he had now an opportunity to open his mouth, and\r\nwas resolved not to omit it. “I am sorry, madam,” cries he, “that your\r\nladyship can't eat; for to be sure you must be hungry after so long\r\nfasting. I hope your ladyship is not uneasy at anything, for, as madam\r\nthere says, all may end better than anybody expects. A gentleman who\r\nwas here just now brought excellent news; and perhaps some folks who\r\nhave given other folks the slip may get to London before they are\r\novertaken; and if they do, I make no doubt but they will find people\r\nwho will be very ready to receive them.”\r\n\r\nAll persons under the apprehension of danger convert whatever they see\r\nand hear into the objects of that apprehension. Sophia therefore\r\nimmediately concluded, from the foregoing speech, that she was known,\r\nand pursued by her father. She was now struck with the utmost\r\nconsternation, and for a few minutes deprived of the power of speech;\r\nwhich she no sooner recovered than she desired the landlord to send\r\nhis servants out of the room, and then, addressing herself to him,\r\nsaid, “I perceive, sir, you know who we are; but I beseech you--nay, I\r\nam convinced, if you have any compassion or goodness, you will not\r\nbetray us.”\r\n\r\n“I betray your ladyship!” quoth the landlord; “no (and then he swore\r\nseveral very hearty oaths); I would sooner be cut into ten thousand\r\npieces. I hate all treachery. I! I never betrayed any one in my life\r\nyet, and I am sure I shall not begin with so sweet a lady as your\r\nladyship. All the world would very much blame me if I should, since it\r\nwill be in your ladyship's power so shortly to reward me. My wife can\r\nwitness for me, I knew your ladyship the moment you came into the\r\nhouse: I said it was your honour, before I lifted you from your horse,\r\nand I shall carry the bruises I got in your ladyship's service to the\r\ngrave; but what signified that, as long as I saved your ladyship? To\r\nbe sure some people this morning would have thought of getting a\r\nreward; but no such thought ever entered into my head. I would sooner\r\nstarve than take any reward for betraying your ladyship.”\r\n\r\n“I promise you, sir,” says Sophia, “if it be ever in my power to\r\nreward you, you shall not lose by your generosity.”\r\n\r\n“Alack-a-day, madam!” answered the landlord; “in your ladyship's\r\npower! Heaven put it as much into your will! I am only afraid your\r\nhonour will forget such a poor man as an innkeeper; but, if your\r\nladyship should not, I hope you will remember what reward I\r\nrefused--refused! that is, I would have refused, and to be sure it may\r\nbe called refusing, for I might have had it certainly; and to be sure\r\nyou might have been in some houses;--but, for my part, would not\r\nmethinks for the world have your ladyship wrong me so much as to\r\nimagine I ever thought of betraying you, even before I heard the good\r\nnews.”\r\n\r\n“What news, pray?” says Sophia, something eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Hath not your ladyship heard it, then?” cries the landlord; “nay,\r\nlike enough, for I heard it only a few minutes ago; and if I had never\r\nheard it, may the devil fly away with me this instant if I would have\r\nbetrayed your honour! no, if I would, may I--” Here he subjoined\r\nseveral dreadful imprecations, which Sophia at last interrupted, and\r\nbegged to know what he meant by the news.--He was going to answer,\r\nwhen Mrs Honour came running into the room, all pale and breathless,\r\nand cried out, “Madam, we are all undone, all ruined, they are come,\r\nthey are come!” These words almost froze up the blood of Sophia; but\r\nMrs Fitzpatrick asked Honour who were come?--“Who?” answered she,\r\n“why, the French; several hundred thousands of them are landed, and we\r\nshall be all murdered and ravished.”\r\n\r\nAs a miser, who hath, in some well-built city, a cottage, value twenty\r\nshillings, when at a distance he is alarmed with the news of a fire,\r\nturns pale and trembles at his loss; but when he finds the beautiful\r\npalaces only are burnt, and his own cottage remains safe, he comes\r\ninstantly to himself, and smiles at his good fortunes: or as (for we\r\ndislike something in the former simile) the tender mother, when\r\nterrified with the apprehension that her darling boy is drowned, is\r\nstruck senseless and almost dead with consternation; but when she is\r\ntold that little master is safe, and the Victory only, with twelve\r\nhundred brave men, gone to the bottom, life and sense again return,\r\nmaternal fondness enjoys the sudden relief from all its fears, and the\r\ngeneral benevolence which at another time would have deeply felt the\r\ndreadful catastrophe, lies fast asleep in her mind;--so Sophia, than\r\nwhom none was more capable of tenderly feeling the general calamity of\r\nher country, found such immediate satisfaction from the relief of\r\nthose terrors she had of being overtaken by her father, that the\r\narrival of the French scarce made any impression on her. She gently\r\nchid her maid for the fright into which she had thrown her, and said\r\n“she was glad it was no worse; for that she had feared somebody else\r\nwas come.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, ay,” quoth the landlord, smiling, “her ladyship knows better\r\nthings; she knows the French are our very best friends, and come over\r\nhither only for our good. They are the people who are to make Old\r\nEngland flourish again. I warrant her honour thought the duke was\r\ncoming; and that was enough to put her into a fright. I was going to\r\ntell your ladyship the news.--His honour's majesty, Heaven bless him,\r\nhath given the duke the slip, and is marching as fast as he can to\r\nLondon, and ten thousand French are landed to join him on the road.”\r\n\r\nSophia was not greatly pleased with this news, nor with the gentleman\r\nwho related it; but, as she still imagined he knew her (for she could\r\nnot possibly have any suspicion of the real truth), she durst not show\r\nany dislike. And now the landlord, having removed the cloth from the\r\ntable, withdrew; but at his departure frequently repeated his hopes of\r\nbeing remembered hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe mind of Sophia was not at all easy under the supposition of being\r\nknown at this house; for she still applied to herself many things\r\nwhich the landlord had addressed to Jenny Cameron; she therefore\r\nordered her maid to pump out of him by what means he had become\r\nacquainted with her person, and who had offered him the reward for\r\nbetraying her; she likewise ordered the horses to be in readiness by\r\nfour in the morning, at which hour Mrs Fitzpatrick promised to bear\r\nher company; and then, composing herself as well as she could, she\r\ndesired that lady to continue her story."

      "content": "In which Mrs Fitzpatrick concludes her history.\r\n\nWhile Mrs Honour, in pursuance of the commands of her mistress,\r\nordered a bowl of punch, and invited my landlord and landlady to\r\npartake of it, Mrs Fitzpatrick thus went on with her relation.\r\n\r\n“Most of the officers who were quartered at a town in our\r\nneighbourhood were of my husband's acquaintance. Among these there was\r\na lieutenant, a very pretty sort of man, and who was married to a\r\nwoman, so agreeable both in her temper and conversation, that from our\r\nfirst knowing each other, which was soon after my lying-in, we were\r\nalmost inseparable companions; for I had the good fortune to make\r\nmyself equally agreeable to her.\r\n\r\n“The lieutenant, who was neither a sot nor a sportsman, was frequently\r\nof our parties; indeed he was very little with my husband, and no more\r\nthan good breeding constrained him to be, as he lived almost\r\nconstantly at our house. My husband often expressed much\r\ndissatisfaction at the lieutenant's preferring my company to his; he\r\nwas very angry with me on that account, and gave me many a hearty\r\ncurse for drawing away his companions; saying, `I ought to be d--n'd\r\nfor having spoiled one of the prettiest fellows in the world, by\r\nmaking a milksop of him.'\r\n\r\n“You will be mistaken, my dear Sophia, if you imagine that the anger\r\nof my husband arose from my depriving him of a companion; for the\r\nlieutenant was not a person with whose society a fool could be\r\npleased; and, if I should admit the possibility of this, so little\r\nright had my husband to place the loss of his companion to me, that I\r\nam convinced it was my conversation alone which induced him ever to\r\ncome to the house. No, child, it was envy, the worst and most\r\nrancorous kind of envy, the envy of superiority of understanding. The\r\nwretch could not bear to see my conversation preferred to his, by a\r\nman of whom he could not entertain the least jealousy. O my dear\r\nSophy, you are a woman of sense; if you marry a man, as is most\r\nprobable you will, of less capacity than yourself, make frequent\r\ntrials of his temper before marriage, and see whether he can bear to\r\nsubmit to such a superiority.--Promise me, Sophy, you will take this\r\nadvice; for you will hereafter find its importance.” “It is very\r\nlikely I shall never marry at all,” answered Sophia; “I think, at\r\nleast, I shall never marry a man in whose understanding I see any\r\ndefects before marriage; and I promise you I would rather give up my\r\nown than see any such afterwards.” “Give up your understanding!”\r\n replied Mrs Fitzpatrick; “oh, fie, child! I will not believe so meanly\r\nof you. Everything else I might myself be brought to give up; but\r\nnever this. Nature would not have allotted this superiority to the\r\nwife in so many instances, if she had intended we should all of us\r\nhave surrendered it to the husband. This, indeed, men of sense never\r\nexpect of us; of which the lieutenant I have just mentioned was one\r\nnotable example; for though he had a very good understanding, he\r\nalways acknowledged (as was really true) that his wife had a better.\r\nAnd this, perhaps, was one reason of the hatred my tyrant bore her.\r\n\r\n“Before he would be so governed by a wife, he said, especially such an\r\nugly b-- (for, indeed, she was not a regular beauty, but very\r\nagreeable and extremely genteel), he would see all the women upon\r\nearth at the devil, which was a very usual phrase with him. He said,\r\nhe wondered what I could see in her to be so charmed with her company:\r\nsince this woman, says he, hath come among us, there is an end of your\r\nbeloved reading, which you pretended to like so much, that you could\r\nnot afford time to return the visits of the ladies in this country;\r\nand I must confess I had been guilty of a little rudeness this way;\r\nfor the ladies there are at least no better than the mere country\r\nladies here; and I think I need make no other excuse to you for\r\ndeclining any intimacy with them.\r\n\r\n“This correspondence, however, continued a whole year, even all the\r\nwhile the lieutenant was quartered in that town; for which I was\r\ncontented to pay the tax of being constantly abused in the manner\r\nabove mentioned by my husband; I mean when he was at home; for he was\r\nfrequently absent a month at a time at Dublin, and once made a journey\r\nof two months to London: in all which journeys I thought it a very\r\nsingular happiness that he never once desired my company; nay, by his\r\nfrequent censures on men who could not travel, as he phrased it,\r\nwithout a wife tied up to their tail, he sufficiently intimated that,\r\nhad I been never so desirous of accompanying him, my wishes would have\r\nbeen in vain; but, Heaven knows, such wishes were very far from my\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\n“At length my friend was removed from me, and I was again left to my\r\nsolitude, to the tormenting conversation with my own reflections, and\r\nto apply to books for my only comfort. I now read almost all day long.\r\nHow many books do you think I read in three months?” “I can't guess,\r\nindeed, cousin,” answered Sophia. “Perhaps half a score.” “Half a\r\nscore! half a thousand, child!” answered the other. “I read a good\r\ndeal in Daniel's English History of France; a great deal in Plutarch's\r\nLives, the Atalantis, Pope's Homer, Dryden's Plays, Chillingworth, the\r\nCountess D'Aulnois, and Locke's Human Understanding.\r\n\r\n“During this interval I wrote three very supplicating, and, I thought,\r\nmoving letters to my aunt; but, as I received no answer to any of\r\nthem, my disdain would not suffer me to continue my application.” Here\r\nshe stopt, and, looking earnestly at Sophia, said, “Methinks, my dear,\r\nI read something in your eyes which reproaches me of a neglect in\r\nanother place, where I should have met with a kinder return.” “Indeed,\r\ndear Harriet,” answered Sophia, “your story is an apology for any\r\nneglect; but, indeed, I feel that I have been guilty of a remissness,\r\nwithout so good an excuse.--Yet pray proceed; for I long, though I\r\ntremble, to hear the end.”\r\n\r\nThus, then, Mrs Fitzpatrick resumed her narrative:--“My husband now\r\ntook a second journey to England, where he continued upwards of three\r\nmonths; during the greater part of this time I led a life which\r\nnothing but having led a worse could make me think tolerable; for\r\nperfect solitude can never be reconciled to a social mind, like mine,\r\nbut when it relieves you from the company of those you hate. What\r\nadded to my wretchedness was the loss of my little infant: not that I\r\npretend to have had for it that extravagant tenderness of which I\r\nbelieve I might have been capable under other circumstances; but I\r\nresolved, in every instance, to discharge the duty of the tenderest\r\nmother; and this care prevented me from feeling the weight of that\r\nheaviest of all things, when it can be at all said to lie heavy on our\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n“I had spent full ten weeks almost entirely by myself, having seen\r\nnobody all that time, except my servants and a very few visitors, when\r\na young lady, a relation to my husband, came from a distant part of\r\nIreland to visit me. She had staid once before a week at my house, and\r\nthen I gave her a pressing invitation to return; for she was a very\r\nagreeable woman, and had improved good natural parts by a proper\r\neducation. Indeed, she was to me a welcome guest.\r\n\r\n“A few days after her arrival, perceiving me in very low spirits,\r\nwithout enquiring the cause, which, indeed, she very well knew, the\r\nyoung lady fell to compassionating my case. She said, `Though\r\npoliteness had prevented me from complaining to my husband's relations\r\nof his behaviour, yet they all were very sensible of it, and felt\r\ngreat concern upon that account; but none more than herself.' And\r\nafter some more general discourse on this head, which I own I could\r\nnot forbear countenancing, at last, after much previous precaution and\r\nenjoined concealment, she communicated to me, as a profound\r\nsecret--that my husband kept a mistress.\r\n\r\n“You will certainly imagine I heard this news with the utmost\r\ninsensibility--Upon my word, if you do, your imagination will mislead\r\nyou. Contempt had not so kept down my anger to my husband, but that\r\nhatred rose again on this occasion. What can be the reason of this?\r\nAre we so abominably selfish, that we can be concerned at others\r\nhaving possession even of what we despise? Or are we not rather\r\nabominably vain, and is not this the greatest injury done to our\r\nvanity? What think you, Sophia?”\r\n\r\n“I don't know, indeed,” answered Sophia; “I have never troubled myself\r\nwith any of these deep contemplations; but I think the lady did very\r\nill in communicating to you such a secret.”\r\n\r\n“And yet, my dear, this conduct is natural,” replied Mrs Fitzpatrick;\r\n“and, when you have seen and read as much as myself, you will\r\nacknowledge it to be so.”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry to hear it is natural,” returned Sophia; “for I want\r\nneither reading nor experience to convince me that it is very\r\ndishonourable and very ill-natured: nay, it is surely as ill-bred to\r\ntell a husband or wife of the faults of each other as to tell them of\r\ntheir own.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” continued Mrs Fitzpatrick, “my husband at last returned; and,\r\nif I am thoroughly acquainted with my own thoughts, I hated him now\r\nmore than ever; but I despised him rather less: for certainly nothing\r\nso much weakens our contempt, as an injury done to our pride or our\r\nvanity.\r\n\r\n“He now assumed a carriage to me so very different from what he had\r\nlately worn, and so nearly resembling his behaviour the first week of\r\nour marriage, that, had I now had any spark of love remaining, he\r\nmight, possibly, have rekindled my fondness for him. But, though\r\nhatred may succeed to contempt, and may perhaps get the better of it,\r\nlove, I believe, cannot. The truth is, the passion of love is too\r\nrestless to remain contented without the gratification which it\r\nreceives from its object; and one can no more be inclined to love\r\nwithout loving than we can have eyes without seeing. When a husband,\r\ntherefore, ceases to be the object of this passion, it is most\r\nprobable some other man--I say, my dear, if your husband grows\r\nindifferent to you--if you once come to despise him--I say--that\r\nis--if you have the passion of love in you--Lud! I have bewildered\r\nmyself so--but one is apt, in these abstracted considerations, to lose\r\nthe concatenation of ideas, as Mr Locke says:--in short, the truth\r\nis--in short, I scarce know what it is; but, as I was saying, my\r\nhusband returned, and his behaviour, at first, greatly surprized me;\r\nbut he soon acquainted me with the motive, and taught me to account\r\nfor it. In a word, then, he had spent and lost all the ready money of\r\nmy fortune; and, as he could mortgage his own estate no deeper, he was\r\nnow desirous to supply himself with cash for his extravagance, by\r\nselling a little estate of mine, which he could not do without my\r\nassistance; and to obtain this favour was the whole and sole motive of\r\nall the fondness which he now put on.\r\n\r\n“With this I peremptorily refused to comply. I told him, and I told\r\nhim truly, that, had I been possessed of the Indies at our first\r\nmarriage, he might have commanded it all; for it had been a constant\r\nmaxim with me, that where a woman disposes of her heart, she should\r\nalways deposit her fortune; but, as he had been so kind, long ago, to\r\nrestore the former into my possession, I was resolved likewise to\r\nretain what little remained of the latter.\r\n\r\n“I will not describe to you the passion into which these words, and\r\nthe resolute air in which they were spoken, threw him: nor will I\r\ntrouble you with the whole scene which succeeded between us. Out came,\r\nyou may be well assured, the story of the mistress; and out it did\r\ncome, with all the embellishments which anger and disdain could bestow\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\n“Mr Fitzpatrick seemed a little thunderstruck with this, and more\r\nconfused than I had seen him, though his ideas are always confused\r\nenough, heaven knows. He did not, however, endeavour to exculpate\r\nhimself; but took a method which almost equally confounded me. What\r\nwas this but recrimination? He affected to be jealous:--he may, for\r\naught I know, be inclined enough to jealousy in his natural temper;\r\nnay, he must have had it from nature, or the devil must have put it\r\ninto his head; for I defy all the world to cast a just aspersion on my\r\ncharacter: nay, the most scandalous tongues have never dared censure\r\nmy reputation. My fame, I thank heaven, hath been always as spotless\r\nas my life; and let falsehood itself accuse that if it dare. No, my\r\ndear Graveairs, however provoked, however ill-treated, however injured\r\nin my love, I have firmly resolved never to give the least room for\r\ncensure on this account.--And yet, my dear, there are some people so\r\nmalicious, some tongues so venomous, that no innocence can escape\r\nthem. The most undesigned word, the most accidental look, the least\r\nfamiliarity, the most innocent freedom, will be misconstrued, and\r\nmagnified into I know not what, by some people. But I despise, my dear\r\nGraveairs, I despise all such slander. No such malice, I assure you,\r\never gave me an uneasy moment. No, no, I promise you I am above all\r\nthat.--But where was I? O let me see, I told you my husband was\r\njealous--And of whom, I pray?--Why, of whom but the lieutenant I\r\nmentioned to you before! He was obliged to resort above a year and\r\nmore back to find any object for this unaccountable passion, if,\r\nindeed, he really felt any such, and was not an arrant counterfeit in\r\norder to abuse me.\r\n\r\n“But I have tired you already with too many particulars. I will now\r\nbring my story to a very speedy conclusion. In short, then, after many\r\nscenes very unworthy to be repeated, in which my cousin engaged so\r\nheartily on my side, that Mr Fitzpatrick at last turned her out of\r\ndoors; when he found I was neither to be soothed nor bullied into\r\ncompliance, he took a very violent method indeed. Perhaps you will\r\nconclude he beat me; but this, though he hath approached very near to\r\nit, he never actually did. He confined me to my room, without\r\nsuffering me to have either pen, ink, paper, or book: and a servant\r\nevery day made my bed, and brought me my food.\r\n\r\n“When I had remained a week under this imprisonment, he made me a\r\nvisit, and, with the voice of a schoolmaster, or, what is often much\r\nthe same, of a tyrant, asked me, `If I would yet comply?' I answered,\r\nvery stoutly, `That I would die first.' `Then so you shall, and be\r\nd--nd!' cries he; `for you shall never go alive out of this room.'\r\n\r\n“Here I remained a fortnight longer; and, to say the truth, my\r\nconstancy was almost subdued, and I began to think of submission;\r\nwhen, one day, in the absence of my husband, who was gone abroad for\r\nsome short time, by the greatest good fortune in the world, an\r\naccident happened.--I--at a time when I began to give way to the\r\nutmost despair----everything would be excusable at such a time--at\r\nthat very time I received----But it would take up an hour to tell you\r\nall particulars.--In one word, then (for I will not tire you with\r\ncircumstances), gold, the common key to all padlocks, opened my door,\r\nand set me at liberty.\r\n\r\n“I now made haste to Dublin, where I immediately procured a passage to\r\nEngland; and was proceeding to Bath, in order to throw myself into the\r\nprotection of my aunt, or of your father, or of any relation who would\r\nafford it me. My husband overtook me last night at the inn where I\r\nlay, and which you left a few minutes before me; but I had the good\r\nluck to escape him, and to follow you.\r\n\r\n“And thus, my dear, ends my history: a tragical one, I am sure, it is\r\nto myself; but, perhaps, I ought rather to apologize to you for its\r\ndullness.”\r\n\r\nSophia heaved a deep sigh, and answered, “Indeed, Harriet, I pity you\r\nfrom my soul!----But what could you expect? Why, why, would you marry\r\nan Irishman?”\r\n\r\n“Upon my word,” replied her cousin, “your censure is unjust. There\r\nare, among the Irish, men of as much worth and honour as any among the\r\nEnglish: nay, to speak the truth, generosity of spirit is rather more\r\ncommon among them. I have known some examples there, too, of good\r\nhusbands; and I believe these are not very plenty in England. Ask me,\r\nrather, what I could expect when I married a fool; and I will tell you\r\na solemn truth; I did not know him to be so.”--“Can no man,” said\r\nSophia, in a very low and altered voice, “do you think, make a bad\r\nhusband, who is not a fool?” “That,” answered the other, “is too\r\ngeneral a negative; but none, I believe, is so likely as a fool to\r\nprove so. Among my acquaintance, the silliest fellows are the worst\r\nhusbands; and I will venture to assert, as a fact, that a man of sense\r\nrarely behaves very ill to a wife who deserves very well.”"

      "content": "A dreadful alarm in the inn, with the arrival of an unexpected friend\r\nof Mrs Fitzpatrick.\r\n\nSophia now, at the desire of her cousin, related--not what follows,\r\nbut what hath gone before in this history: for which reason the reader\r\nwill, I suppose, excuse me for not repeating it over again.\r\n\r\nOne remark, however, I cannot forbear making on her narrative, namely,\r\nthat she made no more mention of Jones, from the beginning to the end,\r\nthan if there had been no such person alive. This I will neither\r\nendeavour to account for nor to excuse. Indeed, if this may be called\r\na kind of dishonesty, it seems the more inexcusable, from the apparent\r\nopenness and explicit sincerity of the other lady.--But so it was.\r\n\r\nJust as Sophia arrived at the conclusion of her story, there arrived\r\nin the room where the two ladies were sitting a noise, not unlike, in\r\nloudness, to that of a pack of hounds just let out from their kennel;\r\nnor, in shrillness, to cats, when caterwauling; or to screech owls;\r\nor, indeed, more like (for what animal can resemble a human voice?) to\r\nthose sounds which, in the pleasant mansions of that gate which seems\r\nto derive its name from a duplicity of tongues, issue from the mouths,\r\nand sometimes from the nostrils, of those fair river nymphs, ycleped\r\nof old the Naïades; in the vulgar tongue translated oyster-wenches;\r\nfor when, instead of the antient libations of milk and honey and oil,\r\nthe rich distillation from the juniper-berry, or, perhaps, from malt,\r\nhath, by the early devotion of their votaries, been poured forth in\r\ngreat abundance, should any daring tongue with unhallowed license\r\nprophane, _i.e._, depreciate, the delicate fat Milton oyster, the\r\nplaice sound and firm, the flounder as much alive as when in the\r\nwater, the shrimp as big as a prawn, the fine cod alive but a few\r\nhours ago, or any other of the various treasures which those\r\nwater-deities who fish the sea and rivers have committed to the care\r\nof the nymphs, the angry Naïades lift up their immortal voices, and\r\nthe prophane wretch is struck deaf for his impiety.\r\n\r\nSuch was the noise which now burst from one of the rooms below; and\r\nsoon the thunder, which long had rattled at a distance, began to\r\napproach nearer and nearer, till, having ascended by degrees upstairs,\r\nit at last entered the apartment where the ladies were. In short, to\r\ndrop all metaphor and figure, Mrs Honour, having scolded violently\r\nbelow-stairs, and continued the same all the way up, came in to her\r\nmistress in a most outrageous passion, crying out, “What doth your\r\nladyship think? Would you imagine that this impudent villain, the\r\nmaster of this house, hath had the impudence to tell me, nay, to stand\r\nit out to my face, that your ladyship is that nasty, stinking wh--re\r\n(Jenny Cameron they call her), that runs about the country with the\r\nPretender? Nay, the lying, saucy villain had the assurance to tell me\r\nthat your ladyship had owned yourself to be so; but I have clawed the\r\nrascal; I have left the marks of my nails in his impudent face. My\r\nlady! says I, you saucy scoundrel; my lady is meat for no pretenders.\r\nShe is a young lady of as good fashion, and family, and fortune, as\r\nany in Somersetshire. Did you never hear of the great Squire Western,\r\nsirrah? She is his only daughter; she is----, and heiress to all his\r\ngreat estate. My lady to be called a nasty Scotch wh--re by such a\r\nvarlet!--To be sure I wish I had knocked his brains out with the\r\npunch-bowl.”\r\n\r\nThe principal uneasiness with which Sophia was affected on this\r\noccasion Honour had herself caused, by having in her passion\r\ndiscovered who she was. However, as this mistake of the landlord\r\nsufficiently accounted for those passages which Sophia had before\r\nmistaken, she acquired some ease on that account; nor could she, upon\r\nthe whole, forbear smiling. This enraged Honour, and she cried,\r\n“Indeed, madam, I did not think your ladyship would have made a\r\nlaughing matter of it. To be called whore by such an impudent low\r\nrascal. Your ladyship may be angry with me, for aught I know, for\r\ntaking your part, since proffered service, they say, stinks; but to be\r\nsure I could never bear to hear a lady of mine called whore.--Nor will\r\nI bear it. I am sure your ladyship is as virtuous a lady as ever sat\r\nfoot on English ground, and I will claw any villain's eyes out who\r\ndares for to offer to presume for to say the least word to the\r\ncontrary. Nobody ever could say the least ill of the character of any\r\nlady that ever I waited upon.”\r\n\r\n_Hinc illae lachrymae;_ in plain truth, Honour had as much love for\r\nher mistress as most servants have, that is to say--But besides this,\r\nher pride obliged her to support the character of the lady she waited\r\non; for she thought her own was in a very close manner connected with\r\nit. In proportion as the character of her mistress was raised, hers\r\nlikewise, as she conceived, was raised with it; and, on the contrary,\r\nshe thought the one could not be lowered without the other.\r\n\r\nOn this subject, reader, I must stop a moment, to tell thee a story.\r\n“The famous Nell Gwynn, stepping one day, from a house where she had\r\nmade a short visit, into her coach, saw a great mob assembled, and her\r\nfootman all bloody and dirty; the fellow, being asked by his mistress\r\nthe reason of his being in that condition, answered, `I have been\r\nfighting, madam, with an impudent rascal who called your ladyship a\r\nwh--re.' `You blockhead,' replied Mrs Gwynn, `at this rate you must\r\nfight every day of your life; why, you fool, all the world knows it.'\r\n`Do they?' cries the fellow, in a muttering voice, after he had shut\r\nthe coach-door, `they shan't call me a whore's footman for all that.'”\r\n\r\nThus the passion of Mrs Honour appears natural enough, even if it were\r\nto be no otherwise accounted for; but, in reality, there was another\r\ncause of her anger; for which we must beg leave to remind our reader\r\nof a circumstance mentioned in the above simile. There are indeed\r\ncertain liquors, which, being applied to our passions, or to fire,\r\nproduce effects the very reverse of those produced by water, as they\r\nserve to kindle and inflame, rather than to extinguish. Among these,\r\nthe generous liquor called punch is one. It was not, therefore,\r\nwithout reason, that the learned Dr Cheney used to call drinking punch\r\npouring liquid fire down your throat.\r\n\r\nNow, Mrs Honour had unluckily poured so much of this liquid fire down\r\nher throat, that the smoke of it began to ascend into her pericranium\r\nand blinded the eyes of Reason, which is there supposed to keep her\r\nresidence, while the fire itself from the stomach easily reached the\r\nheart, and there inflamed the noble passion of pride. So that, upon\r\nthe whole, we shall cease to wonder at the violent rage of the\r\nwaiting-woman; though at first sight we must confess the cause seems\r\ninadequate to the effect.\r\n\r\nSophia and her cousin both did all in their power to extinguish these\r\nflames which had roared so loudly all over the house. They at length\r\nprevailed; or, to carry the metaphor one step farther, the fire,\r\nhaving consumed all the fuel which the language affords, to wit, every\r\nreproachful term in it, at last went out of its own accord.\r\n\r\nBut, though tranquillity was restored above-stairs, it was not so\r\nbelow; where my landlady, highly resenting the injury done to the\r\nbeauty of her husband by the flesh-spades of Mrs Honour, called aloud\r\nfor revenge and justice. As to the poor man, who had principally\r\nsuffered in the engagement, he was perfectly quiet. Perhaps the blood\r\nwhich he lost might have cooled his anger: for the enemy had not only\r\napplied her nails to his cheeks, but likewise her fist to his\r\nnostrils, which lamented the blow with tears of blood in great\r\nabundance. To this we may add reflections on his mistake; but indeed\r\nnothing so effectually silenced his resentment as the manner in which\r\nhe now discovered his error; for as to the behaviour of Mrs Honour, it\r\nhad the more confirmed him in his opinion; but he was now assured by a\r\nperson of great figure, and who was attended by a great equipage, that\r\none of the ladies was a woman of fashion, and his intimate\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\r\nBy the orders of this person, the landlord now ascended, and\r\nacquainted our fair travellers that a great gentleman below desired to\r\ndo them the honour of waiting on them. Sophia turned pale and trembled\r\nat this message, though the reader will conclude it was too civil,\r\nnotwithstanding the landlord's blunder, to have come from her father;\r\nbut fear hath the common fault of a justice of peace, and is apt to\r\nconclude hastily from every slight circumstance, without examining the\r\nevidence on both sides.\r\n\r\nTo ease the reader's curiosity, therefore, rather than his\r\napprehensions, we proceed to inform him that an Irish peer had arrived\r\nvery late that evening at the inn, in his way to London. This\r\nnobleman, having sallied from his supper at the hurricane before\r\ncommemorated, had seen the attendant of Mrs Fitzpatrick, and upon a\r\nshort enquiry, was informed that her lady, with whom he was very\r\nparticularly acquainted, was above. This information he had no sooner\r\nreceived than he addressed himself to the landlord, pacified him, and\r\nsent him upstairs with compliments rather civiller than those which\r\nwere delivered.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be wondered at that the waiting-woman herself was not\r\nthe messenger employed on this occasion; but we are sorry to say she\r\nwas not at present qualified for that, or indeed for any other office.\r\nThe rum (for so the landlord chose to call the distillation from malt)\r\nhad basely taken the advantage of the fatigue which the poor woman had\r\nundergone, and had made terrible depredations on her noble faculties,\r\nat a time when they were very unable to resist the attack.\r\n\r\nWe shall not describe this tragical scene too fully; but we thought\r\nourselves obliged, by that historic integrity which we profess,\r\nshortly to hint a matter which we would otherwise have been glad to\r\nhave spared. Many historians, indeed, for want of this integrity, or\r\nof diligence, to say no worse, often leave the reader to find out\r\nthese little circumstances in the dark, and sometimes to his great\r\nconfusion and perplexity.\r\n\r\nSophia was very soon eased of her causeless fright by the entry of the\r\nnoble peer, who was not only an intimate acquaintance of Mrs\r\nFitzpatrick, but in reality a very particular friend of that lady. To\r\nsay truth, it was by his assistance that she had been enabled to\r\nescape from her husband; for this nobleman had the same gallant\r\ndisposition with those renowned knights of whom we read in heroic\r\nstory, and had delivered many an imprisoned nymph from durance. He was\r\nindeed as bitter an enemy to the savage authority too often exercised\r\nby husbands and fathers, over the young and lovely of the other sex,\r\nas ever knight-errant was to the barbarous power of enchanters; nay,\r\nto say truth, I have often suspected that those very enchanters with\r\nwhich romance everywhere abounds were in reality no other than the\r\nhusbands of those days; and matrimony itself was, perhaps, the\r\nenchanted castle in which the nymphs were said to be confined.\r\n\r\nThis nobleman had an estate in the neighbourhood of Fitzpatrick, and\r\nhad been for some time acquainted with the lady. No sooner, therefore,\r\ndid he hear of her confinement, than he earnestly applied himself to\r\nprocure her liberty; which he presently effected, not by storming the\r\ncastle, according to the example of antient heroes, but by corrupting\r\nthe governor, in conformity with the modern art of war, in which craft\r\nis held to be preferable to valour, and gold is found to be more\r\nirresistible than either lead or steel.\r\n\r\nThis circumstance, however, as the lady did not think it material\r\nenough to relate to her friend, we would not at that time impart it to\r\nthe reader. We rather chose to leave him a while under a supposition\r\nthat she had found, or coined, or by some very extraordinary, perhaps\r\nsupernatural means, had possessed herself of the money with which she\r\nhad bribed her keeper, than to interrupt her narrative by giving a\r\nhint of what seemed to her of too little importance to be mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe peer, after a short conversation, could not forbear expressing\r\nsome surprize at meeting the lady in that place; nor could he refrain\r\nfrom telling her he imagined she had been gone to Bath. Mrs\r\nFitzpatrick very freely answered, “That she had been prevented in her\r\npurpose by the arrival of a person she need not mention. In short,”\r\n says she, “I was overtaken by my husband (for I need not affect to\r\nconceal what the world knows too well already). I had the good fortune\r\nto escape in a most surprizing manner, and am now going to London with\r\nthis young lady, who is a near relation of mine, and who hath escaped\r\nfrom as great a tyrant as my own.”\r\n\r\nHis lordship, concluding that this tyrant was likewise a husband, made\r\na speech full of compliments to both the ladies, and as full of\r\ninvectives against his own sex; nor indeed did he avoid some oblique\r\nglances at the matrimonial institution itself, and at the unjust\r\npowers given by it to man over the more sensible and more meritorious\r\npart of the species. He ended his oration with an offer of his\r\nprotection, and of his coach and six, which was instantly accepted by\r\nMrs Fitzpatrick, and at last, upon her persuasions, by Sophia.\r\n\r\nMatters being thus adjusted, his lordship took his leave, and the\r\nladies retired to rest, where Mrs Fitzpatrick entertained her cousin\r\nwith many high encomiums on the character of the noble peer, and\r\nenlarged very particularly on his great fondness for his wife; saying,\r\nshe believed he was almost the only person of high rank who was\r\nentirely constant to the marriage bed. “Indeed,” added she, “my dear\r\nSophy, that is a very rare virtue amongst men of condition. Never\r\nexpect it when you marry; for, believe me, if you do, you will\r\ncertainly be deceived.”\r\n\r\nA gentle sigh stole from Sophia at these words, which perhaps\r\ncontributed to form a dream of no very pleasant kind; but, as she\r\nnever revealed this dream to any one, so the reader cannot expect to\r\nsee it related here."

      "content": "The morning introduced in some pretty writing. A stagecoach. The\r\ncivility of chambermaids. The heroic temper of Sophia. Her generosity.\r\nThe return to it. The departure of the company, and their arrival at\r\nLondon; with some remarks for the use of travellers.\r\n\nThose members of society who are born to furnish the blessings of life\r\nnow began to light their candles, in order to pursue their daily\r\nlabours for the use of those who are born to enjoy these blessings.\r\nThe sturdy hind now attends the levee of his fellow-labourer the ox;\r\nthe cunning artificer, the diligent mechanic, spring from their hard\r\nmattress; and now the bonny housemaid begins to repair the disordered\r\ndrum-room, while the riotous authors of that disorder, in broken\r\ninterrupted slumbers, tumble and toss, as if the hardness of down\r\ndisquieted their repose.\r\n\r\nIn simple phrase, the clock had no sooner struck seven than the ladies\r\nwere ready for their journey; and, at their desire, his lordship and\r\nhis equipage were prepared to attend them.\r\n\r\nAnd now a matter of some difficulty arose; and this was how his\r\nlordship himself should be conveyed; for though in stage-coaches,\r\nwhere passengers are properly considered as so much luggage, the\r\ningenious coachman stows half a dozen with perfect ease into the place\r\nof four; for well he contrives that the fat hostess, or well-fed\r\nalderman, may take up no more room than the slim miss, or taper\r\nmaster; it being the nature of guts, when well squeezed, to give way,\r\nand to lie in a narrow compass; yet in these vehicles, which are\r\ncalled, for distinction's sake, gentlemen's coaches, though they are\r\noften larger than the others, this method of packing is never\r\nattempted.\r\n\r\nHis lordship would have put a short end to the difficulty, by very\r\ngallantly desiring to mount his horse; but Mrs Fitzpatrick would by no\r\nmeans consent to it. It was therefore concluded that the Abigails\r\nshould, by turns, relieve each other on one of his lordship's horses,\r\nwhich was presently equipped with a side-saddle for that purpose.\r\n\r\nEverything being settled at the inn, the ladies discharged their\r\nformer guides, and Sophia made a present to the landlord, partly to\r\nrepair the bruise which he had received under herself, and partly on\r\naccount of what he had suffered under the hands of her enraged\r\nwaiting-woman. And now Sophia first discovered a loss which gave her\r\nsome uneasiness; and this was of the hundred-pound bank-bill which her\r\nfather had given her at their last meeting; and which, within a very\r\ninconsiderable trifle, was all the treasure she was at present worth.\r\nShe searched everywhere, and shook and tumbled all her things to no\r\npurpose, the bill was not to be found: and she was at last fully\r\npersuaded that she had lost it from her pocket when she had the\r\nmisfortune of tumbling from her horse in the dark lane, as before\r\nrecorded: a fact that seemed the more probable, as she now recollected\r\nsome discomposure in her pockets which had happened at that time, and\r\nthe great difficulty with which she had drawn forth her handkerchief\r\nthe very instant before her fall, in order to relieve the distress of\r\nMrs Fitzpatrick.\r\n\r\nMisfortunes of this kind, whatever inconveniencies they may be\r\nattended with, are incapable of subduing a mind in which there is any\r\nstrength, without the assistance of avarice. Sophia, therefore, though\r\nnothing could be worse timed than this accident at such a season,\r\nimmediately got the better of her concern, and, with her wonted\r\nserenity and cheerfulness of countenance, returned to her company. His\r\nlordship conducted the ladies into the vehicle, as he did likewise Mrs\r\nHonour, who, after many civilities, and more dear madams, at last\r\nyielded to the well-bred importunities of her sister Abigail, and\r\nsubmitted to be complimented with the first ride in the coach; in\r\nwhich indeed she would afterwards have been contented to have pursued\r\nher whole journey, had not her mistress, after several fruitless\r\nintimations, at length forced her to take her turn on horseback.\r\n\r\nThe coach, now having received its company, began to move forwards,\r\nattended by many servants, and led by two captains, who had before\r\nrode with his lordship, and who would have been dismissed from the\r\nvehicle upon a much less worthy occasion than was this of\r\naccommodating two ladies. In this they acted only as gentlemen; but\r\nthey were ready at any time to have performed the office of a footman,\r\nor indeed would have condescended lower, for the honour of his\r\nlordship's company, and for the convenience of his table.\r\n\r\nMy landlord was so pleased with the present he had received from\r\nSophia, that he rather rejoiced in than regretted his bruise or his\r\nscratches. The reader will perhaps be curious to know the _quantum_ of\r\nthis present; but we cannot satisfy his curiosity. Whatever it was, it\r\nsatisfied the landlord for his bodily hurt; but he lamented he had not\r\nknown before how little the lady valued her money; “For to be sure,”\r\n says he, “one might have charged every article double, and she would\r\nhave made no cavil at the reckoning.”\r\n\r\nHis wife, however, was far from drawing this conclusion; whether she\r\nreally felt any injury done to her husband more than he did himself, I\r\nwill not say: certain it is, she was much less satisfied with the\r\ngenerosity of Sophia. “Indeed,” cries she, “my dear, the lady knows\r\nbetter how to dispose of her money than you imagine. She might very\r\nwell think we should not put up such a business without some\r\nsatisfaction, and the law would have cost her an infinite deal more\r\nthan this poor little matter, which I wonder you would take.” “You are\r\nalways so bloodily wise,” quoth the husband: “it would have cost her\r\nmore, would it? dost fancy I don't know that as well as thee? but\r\nwould any of that more, or so much, have come into our pockets?\r\nIndeed, if son Tom the lawyer had been alive, I could have been glad\r\nto have put such a pretty business into his hands. He would have got a\r\ngood picking out of it; but I have no relation now who is a lawyer,\r\nand why should I go to law for the benefit of strangers?” “Nay, to be\r\nsure,” answered she, “you must know best.” “I believe I do,” replied\r\nhe. “I fancy, when money is to be got, I can smell it out as well as\r\nanother. Everybody, let me tell you, would not have talked people out\r\nof this. Mind that, I say; everybody would not have cajoled this out\r\nof her, mind that.” The wife then joined in the applause of her\r\nhusband's sagacity; and thus ended the short dialogue between them on\r\nthis occasion.\r\n\r\nWe will therefore take our leave of these good people, and attend his\r\nlordship and his fair companions, who made such good expedition that\r\nthey performed a journey of ninety miles in two days, and on the\r\nsecond evening arrived in London, without having encountered any one\r\nadventure on the road worthy the dignity of this history to relate.\r\nOur pen, therefore, shall imitate the expedition which it describes,\r\nand our history shall keep pace with the travellers who are its\r\nsubject. Good writers will, indeed, do well to imitate the ingenious\r\ntraveller in this instance, who always proportions his stay at any\r\nplace to the beauties, elegancies, and curiosities which it affords.\r\nAt Eshur, at Stowe, at Wilton, at Eastbury, and at Prior's Park, days\r\nare too short for the ravished imagination; while we admire the\r\nwondrous power of art in improving nature. In some of these, art\r\nchiefly engages our admiration; in others, nature and art contend for\r\nour applause; but, in the last, the former seems to triumph. Here\r\nNature appears in her richest attire, and Art, dressed with the\r\nmodestest simplicity, attends her benignant mistress. Here Nature\r\nindeed pours forth the choicest treasures which she hath lavished on\r\nthis world; and here human nature presents you with an object which\r\ncan be exceeded only in the other.\r\n\r\nThe same taste, the same imagination, which luxuriously riots in these\r\nelegant scenes, can be amused with objects of far inferior note. The\r\nwoods, the rivers, the lawns of Devon and of Dorset, attract the eye\r\nof the ingenious traveller, and retard his pace, which delay he\r\nafterwards compensates by swiftly scouring over the gloomy heath of\r\nBagshot, or that pleasant plain which extends itself westward from\r\nStockbridge, where no other object than one single tree only in\r\nsixteen miles presents itself to the view, unless the clouds, in\r\ncompassion to our tired spirits, kindly open their variegated mansions\r\nto our prospect.\r\n\r\nNot so travels the money-meditating tradesman, the sagacious justice,\r\nthe dignified doctor, the warm-clad grazier, with all the numerous\r\noffspring of wealth and dulness. On they jog, with equal pace, through\r\nthe verdant meadows or over the barren heath, their horses measuring\r\nfour miles and a half per hour with the utmost exactness; the eyes of\r\nthe beast and of his master being alike directed forwards, and\r\nemployed in contemplating the same objects in the same manner.

      "content": "Containing a hint or two concerning virtue, and a few more concerning\r\nsuspicion.\r\n\nOur company, being arrived at London, were set down at his lordship's\r\nhouse, where, while they refreshed themselves after the fatigue of\r\ntheir journey, servants were despatched to provide a lodging for the\r\ntwo ladies; for, as her ladyship was not then in town, Mrs Fitzpatrick\r\nwould by no means consent to accept a bed in the mansion of the peer.\r\n\r\nSome readers will, perhaps, condemn this extraordinary delicacy, as I\r\nmay call it, of virtue, as too nice and scrupulous; but we must make\r\nallowances for her situation, which must be owned to have been very\r\nticklish; and, when we consider the malice of censorious tongues, we\r\nmust allow, if it was a fault, the fault was an excess on the right\r\nside, and which every woman who is in the self-same situation will do\r\nwell to imitate. The most formal appearance of virtue, when it is only\r\nan appearance, may, perhaps, in very abstracted considerations, seem\r\nto be rather less commendable than virtue itself without this\r\nformality; but it will, however, be always more commended; and this, I\r\nbelieve, will be granted by all, that it is necessary, unless in some\r\nvery particular cases, for every woman to support either the one or\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nA lodging being prepared, Sophia accompanied her cousin for that\r\nevening; but resolved early in the morning to enquire after the lady\r\ninto whose protection, as we have formerly mentioned, she had\r\ndetermined to throw herself when she quitted her father's house. And\r\nthis she was the more eager in doing from some observations she had\r\nmade during her journey in the coach.\r\n\r\nNow, as we would by no means fix the odious character of suspicion on\r\nSophia, we are almost afraid to open to our reader the conceits which\r\nfilled her mind concerning Mrs Fitzpatrick; of whom she certainly\r\nentertained at present some doubts; which, as they are very apt to\r\nenter into the bosoms of the worst of people, we think proper not to\r\nmention more plainly till we have first suggested a word or two to our\r\nreader touching suspicion in general.\r\n\r\nOf this there have always appeared to me to be two degrees. The first\r\nof these I chuse to derive from the heart, as the extreme velocity of\r\nits discernment seems to denote some previous inward impulse, and the\r\nrather as this superlative degree often forms its own objects; sees\r\nwhat is not, and always more than really exists. This is that\r\nquick-sighted penetration whose hawk's eyes no symptom of evil can\r\nescape; which observes not only upon the actions, but upon the words\r\nand looks, of men; and, as it proceeds from the heart of the observer,\r\nso it dives into the heart of the observed, and there espies evil, as\r\nit were, in the first embryo; nay, sometimes before it can be said to\r\nbe conceived. An admirable faculty, if it were infallible; but, as this\r\ndegree of perfection is not even claimed by more than one mortal being;\r\nso from the fallibility of such acute discernment have arisen many sad\r\nmischiefs and most grievous heart-aches to innocence and virtue. I\r\ncannot help, therefore, regarding this vast quick-sightedness into evil\r\nas a vicious excess, and as a very pernicious evil in itself. And I am\r\nthe more inclined to this opinion, as I am afraid it always proceeds\r\nfrom a bad heart, for the reasons I have above mentioned, and for one\r\nmore, namely, because I never knew it the property of a good one. Now,\r\nfrom this degree of suspicion I entirely and absolutely acquit Sophia.\r\n\r\nA second degree of this quality seems to arise from the head. This is,\r\nindeed, no other than the faculty of seeing what is before your eyes,\r\nand of drawing conclusions from what you see. The former of these is\r\nunavoidable by those who have any eyes, and the latter is perhaps no\r\nless certain and necessary a consequence of our having any brains.\r\nThis is altogether as bitter an enemy to guilt as the former is to\r\ninnocence: nor can I see it in an unamiable light, even though,\r\nthrough human fallibility, it should be sometimes mistaken. For\r\ninstance, if a husband should accidentally surprize his wife in the\r\nlap or in the embraces of some of those pretty young gentlemen who\r\nprofess the art of cuckold-making, I should not highly, I think, blame\r\nhim for concluding something more than what he saw, from the\r\nfamiliarities which he really had seen, and which we are at least\r\nfavourable enough to when we call them innocent freedoms. The reader\r\nwill easily suggest great plenty of instances to himself; I shall add\r\nbut one more, which, however unchristian it may be thought by some, I\r\ncannot help esteeming to be strictly justifiable; and this is a\r\nsuspicion that a man is capable of doing what he hath done already,\r\nand that it is possible for one who hath been a villain once to act\r\nthe same part again. And, to confess the truth, of this degree of\r\nsuspicion I believe Sophia was guilty. From this degree of suspicion\r\nshe had, in fact, conceived an opinion that her cousin was really not\r\nbetter than she should be.\r\n\r\nThe case, it seems, was this: Mrs Fitzpatrick wisely considered that\r\nthe virtue of a young lady is, in the world, in the same situation\r\nwith a poor hare, which is certain, whenever it ventures abroad, to\r\nmeet its enemies; for it can hardly meet any other. No sooner\r\ntherefore was she determined to take the first opportunity of quitting\r\nthe protection of her husband, than she resolved to cast herself under\r\nthe protection of some other man; and whom could she so properly\r\nchoose to be her guardian as a person of quality, of fortune, of\r\nhonour; and who, besides a gallant disposition which inclines men to\r\nknight-errantry, that is, to be the champions of ladies in distress,\r\nhad often declared a violent attachment to herself, and had already\r\ngiven her all the instances of it in his power?\r\n\r\nBut, as the law hath foolishly omitted this office of vice-husband, or\r\nguardian to an eloped lady, and as malice is apt to denominate him by\r\na more disagreeable appellation, it was concluded that his lordship\r\nshould perform all such kind offices to the lady in secret, and\r\nwithout publickly assuming the character of her protector. Nay, to\r\nprevent any other person from seeing him in this light, it was agreed\r\nthat the lady should proceed directly to Bath, and that his lordship\r\nshould first go to London, and thence should go down to that place by\r\nthe advice of his physicians.\r\n\r\nNow all this Sophia very plainly understood, not from the lips or\r\nbehaviour of Mrs Fitzpatrick, but from the peer, who was infinitely\r\nless expert at retaining a secret than was the good lady; and perhaps\r\nthe exact secrecy which Mrs Fitzpatrick had observed on this head in\r\nher narrative served not a little to heighten those suspicions which\r\nwere now risen in the mind of her cousin.\r\n\r\nSophia very easily found out the lady she sought; for indeed there was\r\nnot a chairman in town to whom her house was not perfectly well known;\r\nand, as she received, in return of her first message, a most pressing\r\ninvitation, she immediately accepted it. Mrs Fitzpatrick, indeed, did\r\nnot desire her cousin to stay with her with more earnestness than\r\ncivility required. Whether she had discerned and resented the\r\nsuspicion above-mentioned, or from what other motive it arose, I\r\ncannot say; but certain it is, she was full as desirous of parting\r\nwith Sophia as Sophia herself could be of going.\r\n\r\nThe young lady, when she came to take leave of her cousin, could not\r\navoid giving her a short hint of advice. She begged her, for heaven's\r\nsake, to take care of herself, and to consider in how dangerous a\r\nsituation she stood; adding, she hoped some method would be found of\r\nreconciling her to her husband. “You must remember, my dear,” says\r\nshe, “the maxim which my aunt Western hath so often repeated to us\r\nboth; That whenever the matrimonial alliance is broke, and war\r\ndeclared between husband and wife, she can hardly make a\r\ndisadvantageous peace for herself on any conditions. These are my\r\naunt's very words, and she hath had a great deal of experience in the\r\nworld.” Mrs Fitzpatrick answered, with a contemptuous smile, “Never\r\nfear me, child, take care of yourself; for you are younger than I. I\r\nwill come and visit you in a few days; but, dear Sophy, let me give\r\nyou one piece of advice: leave the character of Graveairs in the\r\ncountry, for, believe me, it will sit very awkwardly upon you in this\r\ntown.”\r\n\r\nThus the two cousins parted, and Sophia repaired directly to Lady\r\nBellaston, where she found a most hearty, as well as a most polite,\r\nwelcome. The lady had taken a great fancy to her when she had seen her\r\nformerly with her aunt Western. She was indeed extremely glad to see\r\nher, and was no sooner acquainted with the reasons which induced her\r\nto leave the squire and to fly to London than she highly applauded her\r\nsense and resolution; and after expressing the highest satisfaction in\r\nthe opinion which Sophia had declared she entertained of her ladyship,\r\nby chusing her house for an asylum, she promised her all the\r\nprotection which it was in her power to give.\r\n\r\nAs we have now brought Sophia into safe hands, the reader will, I\r\napprehend, be contented to deposit her there a while, and to look a\r\nlittle after other personages, and particularly poor Jones, whom we\r\nhave left long enough to do penance for his past offences, which, as\r\nis the nature of vice, brought sufficient punishment upon him\r\nthemselves.\r\n\nBOOK XII.\r\n\r\nCONTAINING THE SAME INDIVIDUAL TIME WITH THE FORMER."

      "content": "Showing what is to be deemed plagiarism in a modern author, and what\r\nis to be considered as lawful prize.\r\n\nThe learned reader must have observed that in the course of this\r\nmighty work, I have often translated passages out of the best antient\r\nauthors, without quoting the original, or without taking the least\r\nnotice of the book from whence they were borrowed.\r\n\r\nThis conduct in writing is placed in a very proper light by the\r\ningenious Abbé Bannier, in his preface to his Mythology, a work of\r\ngreat erudition and of equal judgment. “It will be easy,” says he,\r\n“for the reader to observe that I have frequently had greater regard\r\nto him than to my own reputation: for an author certainly pays him a\r\nconsiderable compliment, when, for his sake, he suppresses learned\r\nquotations that come in his way, and which would have cost him but the\r\nbare trouble of transcribing.”\r\n\r\nTo fill up a work with these scraps may, indeed, be considered as a\r\ndownright cheat on the learned world, who are by such means imposed\r\nupon to buy a second time, in fragments and by retail, what they have\r\nalready in gross, if not in their memories, upon their shelves; and it\r\nis still more cruel upon the illiterate, who are drawn in to pay for\r\nwhat is of no manner of use to them. A writer who intermixes great\r\nquantity of Greek and Latin with his works, deals by the ladies and\r\nfine gentlemen in the same paultry manner with which they are treated\r\nby the auctioneers, who often endeavour so to confound and mix up\r\ntheir lots, that, in order to purchase the commodity you want, you are\r\nobliged at the same time to purchase that which will do you no\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, as there is no conduct so fair and disinterested but that it\r\nmay be misunderstood by ignorance, and misrepresented by malice, I\r\nhave been sometimes tempted to preserve my own reputation at the\r\nexpense of my reader, and to transcribe the original, or at least to\r\nquote chapter and verse, whenever I have made use either of the\r\nthought or expression of another. I am, indeed, in some doubt that I\r\nhave often suffered by the contrary method; and that, by suppressing\r\nthe original author's name, I have been rather suspected of plagiarism\r\nthan reputed to act from the amiable motive assigned by that justly\r\ncelebrated Frenchman.\r\n\r\nNow, to obviate all such imputations for the future, I do here confess\r\nand justify the fact. The antients may be considered as a rich common,\r\nwhere every person who hath the smallest tenement in Parnassus hath a\r\nfree right to fatten his muse. Or, to place it in a clearer light, we\r\nmoderns are to the antients what the poor are to the rich. By the poor\r\nhere I mean that large and venerable body which, in English, we call\r\nthe mob. Now, whoever hath had the honour to be admitted to any degree\r\nof intimacy with this mob, must well know that it is one of their\r\nestablished maxims to plunder and pillage their rich neighbours\r\nwithout any reluctance; and that this is held to be neither sin nor\r\nshame among them. And so constantly do they abide and act by this\r\nmaxim, that, in every parish almost in the kingdom, there is a kind of\r\nconfederacy ever carrying on against a certain person of opulence\r\ncalled the squire, whose property is considered as free-booty by all\r\nhis poor neighbours; who, as they conclude that there is no manner of\r\nguilt in such depredations, look upon it as a point of honour and\r\nmoral obligation to conceal, and to preserve each other from\r\npunishment on all such occasions.\r\n\r\nIn like manner are the antients, such as Homer, Virgil, Horace,\r\nCicero, and the rest, to be esteemed among us writers, as so many\r\nwealthy squires, from whom we, the poor of Parnassus, claim an\r\nimmemorial custom of taking whatever we can come at. This liberty I\r\ndemand, and this I am as ready to allow again to my poor neighbours in\r\ntheir turn. All I profess, and all I require of my brethren, is to\r\nmaintain the same strict honesty among ourselves which the mob show to\r\none another. To steal from one another is indeed highly criminal and\r\nindecent; for this may be strictly stiled defrauding the poor\r\n(sometimes perhaps those who are poorer than ourselves), or, to set it\r\nunder the most opprobrious colours, robbing the spittal.\r\n\r\nSince, therefore, upon the strictest examination, my own conscience\r\ncannot lay any such pitiful theft to my charge, I am contented to\r\nplead guilty to the former accusation; nor shall I ever scruple to\r\ntake to myself any passage which I shall find in an antient author to\r\nmy purpose, without setting down the name of the author from whence it\r\nwas taken. Nay, I absolutely claim a property in all such sentiments\r\nthe moment they are transcribed into my writings, and I expect all\r\nreaders henceforwards to regard them as purely and entirely my own.\r\nThis claim, however, I desire to be allowed me only on condition that\r\nI preserve strict honesty towards my poor brethren, from whom, if ever\r\nI borrow any of that little of which they are possessed, I shall never\r\nfail to put their mark upon it, that it may be at all times ready to\r\nbe restored to the right owner.\r\n\r\nThe omission of this was highly blameable in one Mr Moore, who, having\r\nformerly borrowed some lines of Pope and company, took the liberty to\r\ntranscribe six of them into his play of the Rival Modes. Mr Pope,\r\nhowever, very luckily found them in the said play, and, laying violent\r\nhands on his own property, transferred it back again into his own\r\nworks; and, for a further punishment, imprisoned the said Moore in the\r\nloathsome dungeon of the Dunciad, where his unhappy memory now\r\nremains, and eternally will remain, as a proper punishment for such\r\nhis unjust dealings in the poetical trade."

      "content": "In which, though the squire doth not find his daughter, something is\r\nfound which puts an end to his pursuit.\r\n\nThe history now returns to the inn at Upton, whence we shall first\r\ntrace the footsteps of Squire Western; for, as he will soon arrive at\r\nan end of his journey, we shall have then full leisure to attend our\r\nheroe.\r\n\r\nThe reader may be pleased to remember that the said squire departed\r\nfrom the inn in great fury, and in that fury he pursued his daughter.\r\nThe hostler having informed him that she had crossed the Severn, he\r\nlikewise past that river with his equipage, and rode full speed,\r\nvowing the utmost vengeance against poor Sophia, if he should but\r\novertake her.\r\n\r\nHe had not gone far before he arrived at a crossway. Here he called a\r\nshort council of war, in which, after hearing different opinions, he\r\nat last gave the direction of his pursuit to fortune, and struck\r\ndirectly into the Worcester road.\r\n\r\nIn this road he proceeded about two miles, when he began to bemoan\r\nhimself most bitterly, frequently crying out, “What pity is it! Sure\r\nnever was so unlucky a dog as myself!” And then burst forth a volley\r\nof oaths and execrations.\r\n\r\nThe parson attempted to administer comfort to him on this occasion.\r\n“Sorrow not, sir,” says he, “like those without hope. Howbeit we have\r\nnot yet been able to overtake young madam, we may account it some good\r\nfortune that we have hitherto traced her course aright. Peradventure\r\nshe will soon be fatigated with her journey, and will tarry in some\r\ninn, in order to renovate her corporeal functions; and in that case,\r\nin all moral certainty, you will very briefly be _compos voti_.”\r\n\r\n“Pogh! d--n the slut!” answered the squire, “I am lamenting the loss\r\nof so fine a morning for hunting. It is confounded hard to lose one of\r\nthe best scenting days, in all appearance, which hath been this\r\nseason, and especially after so long a frost.”\r\n\r\nWhether Fortune, who now and then shows some compassion in her\r\nwantonest tricks, might not take pity of the squire; and, as she had\r\ndetermined not to let him overtake his daughter, might not resolve to\r\nmake him amends some other way, I will not assert; but he had hardly\r\nuttered the words just before commemorated, and two or three oaths at\r\ntheir heels, when a pack of hounds began to open their melodious\r\nthroats at a small distance from them, which the squire's horse and\r\nhis rider both perceiving, both immediately pricked up their ears, and\r\nthe squire, crying, “She's gone, she's gone! Damn me if she is not\r\ngone!” instantly clapped spurs to the beast, who little needed it,\r\nhaving indeed the same inclination with his master; and now the whole\r\ncompany, crossing into a corn-field, rode directly towards the hounds,\r\nwith much hallowing and whooping, while the poor parson, blessing\r\nhimself, brought up the rear.\r\n\r\nThus fable reports that the fair Grimalkin, whom Venus, at the desire\r\nof a passionate lover, converted from a cat into a fine woman, no\r\nsooner perceived a mouse than, mindful of her former sport, and still\r\nretaining her pristine nature, she leaped from the bed of her husband\r\nto pursue the little animal.\r\n\r\nWhat are we to understand by this? Not that the bride was displeased\r\nwith the embraces of her amorous bridegroom; for, though some have\r\nremarked that cats are subject to ingratitude, yet women and cats too\r\nwill be pleased and purr on certain occasions. The truth is, as the\r\nsagacious Sir Roger L'Estrange observes, in his deep reflections,\r\nthat, “if we shut Nature out at the door, she will come in at the\r\nwindow; and that puss, though a madam, will be a mouser still.” In the\r\nsame manner we are not to arraign the squire of any want of love for\r\nhis daughter; for in reality he had a great deal; we are only to\r\nconsider that he was a squire and a sportsman, and then we may apply\r\nthe fable to him, and the judicious reflections likewise.\r\n\r\nThe hounds ran very hard, as it is called, and the squire pursued over\r\nhedge and ditch, with all his usual vociferation and alacrity, and\r\nwith all his usual pleasure; nor did the thoughts of Sophia ever once\r\nintrude themselves to allay the satisfaction he enjoyed in the chace,\r\nwhich, he said, was one of the finest he ever saw, and which he swore\r\nwas very well worth going fifty miles for. As the squire forgot his\r\ndaughter, the servants, we may easily believe, forgot their mistress;\r\nand the parson, after having expressed much astonishment, in Latin, to\r\nhimself, at length likewise abandoned all farther thoughts of the\r\nyoung lady, and, jogging on at a distance behind, began to meditate a\r\nportion of doctrine for the ensuing Sunday.\r\n\r\nThe squire who owned the hounds was highly pleased with the arrival of\r\nhis brother squire and sportsman; for all men approve merit in their\r\nown way, and no man was more expert in the field than Mr Western, nor\r\ndid any other better know how to encourage the dogs with his voice,\r\nand to animate the hunt with his holla.\r\n\r\nSportsmen, in the warmth of a chace, are too much engaged to attend to\r\nany manner of ceremony, nay, even to the offices of humanity: for, if\r\nany of them meet with an accident by tumbling into a ditch, or into a\r\nriver, the rest pass on regardless, and generally leave him to his\r\nfate: during this time, therefore, the two squires, though often close\r\nto each other, interchanged not a single word. The master of the hunt,\r\nhowever, often saw and approved the great judgment of the stranger in\r\ndrawing the dogs when they were at a fault, and hence conceived a very\r\nhigh opinion of his understanding, as the number of his attendants\r\ninspired no small reverence to his quality. As soon, therefore, as the\r\nsport was ended by the death of the little animal which had occasioned\r\nit, the two squires met, and in all squire-like greeting saluted each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe conversation was entertaining enough, and what we may perhaps\r\nrelate in an appendix, or on some other occasion; but as it nowise\r\nconcerns this history, we cannot prevail on ourselves to give it a\r\nplace here. It concluded with a second chace, and that with an\r\ninvitation to dinner. This being accepted, was followed by a hearty\r\nbout of drinking, which ended in as hearty a nap on the part of Squire\r\nWestern.\r\n\r\nOur squire was by no means a match either for his host, or for parson\r\nSupple, at his cups that evening; for which the violent fatigue of\r\nmind as well as body that he had undergone, may very well account,\r\nwithout the least derogation from his honour. He was indeed, according\r\nto the vulgar phrase, whistle drunk; for before he had swallowed the\r\nthird bottle, he became so entirely overpowered that though he was not\r\ncarried off to bed till long after, the parson considered him as\r\nabsent, and having acquainted the other squire with all relating to\r\nSophia, he obtained his promise of seconding those arguments which he\r\nintended to urge the next morning for Mr Western's return.\r\n\r\nNo sooner, therefore, had the good squire shaken off his evening, and\r\nbegan to call for his morning draught, and to summon his horses in\r\norder to renew his pursuit, than Mr Supple began his dissuasives,\r\nwhich the host so strongly seconded, that they at length prevailed,\r\nand Mr Western agreed to return home; being principally moved by one\r\nargument, viz., that he knew not which way to go, and might probably\r\nbe riding farther from his daughter instead of towards her. He then\r\ntook leave of his brother sportsman, and expressing great joy that the\r\nfrost was broken (which might perhaps be no small motive to his\r\nhastening home), set forwards, or rather backwards, for Somersetshire;\r\nbut not before he had first despatched part of his retinue in quest of\r\nhis daughter, after whom he likewise sent a volley of the most bitter\r\nexecrations which he could invent."

      "content": "The departure of Jones from Upton, with what passed between him and\r\nPartridge on the road.\r\n\nAt length we are once more come to our heroe; and, to say truth, we\r\nhave been obliged to part with him so long, that, considering the\r\ncondition in which we left him, I apprehend many of our readers have\r\nconcluded we intended to abandon him for ever; he being at present in\r\nthat situation in which prudent people usually desist from enquiring\r\nany farther after their friends, lest they should be shocked by\r\nhearing such friends had hanged themselves.\r\n\r\nBut, in reality, if we have not all the virtues, I will boldly say,\r\nneither have we all the vices of a prudent character; and though it is\r\nnot easy to conceive circumstances much more miserable than those of\r\npoor Jones at present, we shall return to him, and attend upon him\r\nwith the same diligence as if he was wantoning in the brightest beams\r\nof fortune.\r\n\r\nMr Jones, then, and his companion Partridge, left the inn a few\r\nminutes after the departure of Squire Western, and pursued the same\r\nroad on foot, for the hostler told them that no horses were by any\r\nmeans to be at that time procured at Upton. On they marched with heavy\r\nhearts; for though their disquiet proceeded from very different\r\nreasons, yet displeased they were both; and if Jones sighed bitterly,\r\nPartridge grunted altogether as sadly at every step.\r\n\r\nWhen they came to the cross-roads where the squire had stopt to take\r\ncounsel, Jones stopt likewise, and turning to Partridge, asked his\r\nopinion which track they should pursue. “Ah, sir,” answered Partridge,\r\n“I wish your honour would follow my advice.” “Why should I not?”\r\n replied Jones; “for it is now indifferent to me whither I go, or what\r\nbecomes of me.” “My advice, then,” said Partridge, “is, that you\r\nimmediately face about and return home; for who that hath such a home\r\nto return to as your honour, would travel thus about the country like\r\na vagabond? I ask pardon, _sed vox ea sola reperta est_.”\r\n\r\n“Alas!” cries Jones, “I have no home to return to;--but if my friend,\r\nmy father, would receive me, could I bear the country from which\r\nSophia is flown? Cruel Sophia! Cruel! No; let me blame myself!--No;\r\nlet me blame thee. D--nation seize thee--fool--blockhead! thou hast\r\nundone me, and I will tear thy soul from thy body.”--At which words he\r\nlaid violent hands on the collar of poor Partridge, and shook him more\r\nheartily than an ague-fit, or his own fears had ever done before.\r\n\r\nPartridge fell trembling on his knees, and begged for mercy, vowing he\r\nhad meant no harm--when Jones, after staring wildly on him for a\r\nmoment, quitted his hold, and discharged a rage on himself, that, had\r\nit fallen on the other, would certainly have put an end to his being,\r\nwhich indeed the very apprehension of it had almost effected.\r\n\r\nWe would bestow some pains here in minutely describing all the mad\r\npranks which Jones played on this occasion, could we be well assured\r\nthat the reader would take the same pains in perusing them; but as we\r\nare apprehensive that, after all the labour which we should employ in\r\npainting this scene, the said reader would be very apt to skip it\r\nentirely over, we have saved ourselves that trouble. To say the truth,\r\nwe have, from this reason alone, often done great violence to the\r\nluxuriance of our genius, and have left many excellent descriptions\r\nout of our work, which would otherwise have been in it. And this\r\nsuspicion, to be honest, arises, as is generally the case, from our\r\nown wicked heart; for we have, ourselves, been very often most\r\nhorridly given to jumping, as we have run through the pages of\r\nvoluminous historians.\r\n\r\nSuffice it then simply to say, that Jones, after having played the\r\npart of a madman for many minutes, came, by degrees, to himself; which\r\nno sooner happened, than, turning to Partridge, he very earnestly\r\nbegged his pardon for the attack he had made on him in the violence of\r\nhis passion; but concluded, by desiring him never to mention his\r\nreturn again; for he was resolved never to see that country any more.\r\n\r\nPartridge easily forgave, and faithfully promised to obey the\r\ninjunction now laid upon him. And then Jones very briskly cried out,\r\n“Since it is absolutely impossible for me to pursue any farther the\r\nsteps of my angel--I will pursue those of glory. Come on, my brave\r\nlad, now for the army:--it is a glorious cause, and I would willingly\r\nsacrifice my life in it, even though it was worth my preserving.” And\r\nso saying, he immediately struck into the different road from that\r\nwhich the squire had taken, and, by mere chance, pursued the very same\r\nthrough which Sophia had before passed.\r\n\r\nOur travellers now marched a full mile, without speaking a syllable to\r\neach other, though Jones, indeed, muttered many things to himself. As\r\nto Partridge, he was profoundly silent; for he was not, perhaps,\r\nperfectly recovered from his former fright; besides, he had\r\napprehensions of provoking his friend to a second fit of wrath,\r\nespecially as he now began to entertain a conceit, which may not,\r\nperhaps, create any great wonder in the reader. In short, he began now\r\nto suspect that Jones was absolutely out of his senses.\r\n\r\nAt length, Jones, being weary of soliloquy, addressed himself to his\r\ncompanion, and blamed him for his taciturnity; for which the poor man\r\nvery honestly accounted, from his fear of giving offence. And now this\r\nfear being pretty well removed, by the most absolute promises of\r\nindemnity, Partridge again took the bridle from his tongue; which,\r\nperhaps, rejoiced no less at regaining its liberty, than a young colt,\r\nwhen the bridle is slipt from his neck, and he is turned loose into\r\nthe pastures.\r\n\r\nAs Partridge was inhibited from that topic which would have first\r\nsuggested itself, he fell upon that which was next uppermost in his\r\nmind, namely, the Man of the Hill. “Certainly, sir,” says he, “that\r\ncould never be a man, who dresses himself and lives after such a\r\nstrange manner, and so unlike other folks. Besides, his diet, as the\r\nold woman told me, is chiefly upon herbs, which is a fitter food for a\r\nhorse than a Christian: nay, landlord at Upton says that the\r\nneighbours thereabouts have very fearful notions about him. It runs\r\nstrangely in my head that it must have been some spirit, who, perhaps,\r\nmight be sent to forewarn us: and who knows but all that matter which\r\nhe told us, of his going to fight, and of his being taken prisoner,\r\nand of the great danger he was in of being hanged, might be intended\r\nas a warning to us, considering what we are going about? besides, I\r\ndreamt of nothing all last night but of fighting; and methought the\r\nblood ran out of my nose, as liquor out of a tap. Indeed, sir,\r\n_infandum, regina, jubes renovare dolorem_.”\r\n\r\n“Thy story, Partridge,” answered Jones, “is almost as ill applied as\r\nthy Latin. Nothing can be more likely to happen than death to men who\r\ngo into battle. Perhaps we shall both fall in it--and what then?”\r\n “What then?” replied Partridge; “why then there is an end of us, is\r\nthere not? when I am gone, all is over with me. What matters the cause\r\nto me, or who gets the victory, if I am killed? I shall never enjoy\r\nany advantage from it. What are all the ringing of bells, and\r\nbonfires, to one that is six foot under ground? there will be an end\r\nof poor Partridge.” “And an end of poor Partridge,” cries Jones,\r\n“there must be, one time or other. If you love Latin, I will repeat\r\nyou some fine lines out of Horace, which would inspire courage into a\r\ncoward.\r\n\r\n `_Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori\r\n Mors et fugacem persequitur virum\r\n Nec parcit imbellis juventae\r\n Poplitibus, timidoque tergo._'”\r\n\r\n“I wish you would construe them,” cries Partridge; “for Horace is a\r\nhard author, and I cannot understand as you repeat them.”\r\n\r\n“I will repeat you a bad imitation, or rather paraphrase, of my own,”\r\n said Jones; “for I am but an indifferent poet:\r\n\r\n`Who would not die in his dear country's cause? Since, if base fear\r\nhis dastard step withdraws, From death he cannot fly:--One common\r\ngrave Receives, at last, the coward and the brave.'”\r\n\r\n“That's very certain,” cries Partridge. “Ay, sure, _Mors omnibus\r\ncommunis:_ but there is a great difference between dying in one's bed\r\na great many years hence, like a good Christian, with all our friends\r\ncrying about us, and being shot to-day or to-morrow, like a mad dog;\r\nor, perhaps, hacked in twenty pieces with the sword, and that too\r\nbefore we have repented of all our sins. O Lord, have mercy upon us!\r\nto be sure the soldiers are a wicked kind of people. I never loved to\r\nhave anything to do with them. I could hardly bring myself ever to\r\nlook upon them as Christians. There is nothing but cursing and\r\nswearing among them. I wish your honour would repent: I heartily wish\r\nyou would repent before it is too late; and not think of going among\r\nthem.--Evil communication corrupts good manners. That is my principal\r\nreason. For as for that matter, I am no more afraid than another man,\r\nnot I; as to matter of that. I know all human flesh must die; but yet\r\na man may live many years, for all that. Why, I am a middle-aged man\r\nnow, and yet I may live a great number of years. I have read of\r\nseveral who have lived to be above a hundred, and some a great deal\r\nabove a hundred. Not that I hope, I mean that I promise myself, to\r\nlive to any such age as that, neither.--But if it be only to eighty or\r\nninety. Heaven be praised, that is a great ways off yet; and I am not\r\nafraid of dying then, no more than another man; but, surely, to tempt\r\ndeath before a man's time is come seems to me downright wickedness and\r\npresumption. Besides, if it was to do any good indeed; but, let the\r\ncause be what it will, what mighty matter of good can two people do?\r\nand, for my part, I understand nothing of it. I never fired off a gun\r\nabove ten times in my life; and then it was not charged with bullets.\r\nAnd for the sword, I never learned to fence, and know nothing of the\r\nmatter. And then there are those cannons, which certainly it must be\r\nthought the highest presumption to go in the way of; and nobody but a\r\nmadman--I ask pardon; upon my soul I meant no harm; I beg I may not\r\nthrow your honour into another passion.”\r\n\r\n“Be under no apprehension, Partridge,” cries Jones; “I am now so well\r\nconvinced of thy cowardice, that thou couldst not provoke me on any\r\naccount.” “Your honour,” answered he, “may call me coward, or anything\r\nelse you please. If loving to sleep in a whole skin makes a man a\r\ncoward, _non immunes ab illis malis sumus_. I never read in my grammar\r\nthat a man can't be a good man without fighting. _Vir bonus est quis?\r\nQui consulta patrum, qui leges juraque servat_. Not a word of\r\nfighting; and I am sure the scripture is so much against it, that a\r\nman shall never persuade me he is a good Christian while he sheds\r\nChristian blood.”"

      "content": "The adventure of a beggar-man.\r\n\nJust as Partridge had uttered that good and pious doctrine, with which\r\nthe last chapter concluded, they arrived at another cross-way, when a\r\nlame fellow in rags asked them for alms; upon which Partridge gave him\r\na severe rebuke, saying, “Every parish ought to keep their own poor.”\r\n Jones then fell a-laughing, and asked Partridge, “if he was not\r\nashamed, with so much charity in his mouth, to have no charity in his\r\nheart. Your religion,” says he, “serves you only for an excuse for\r\nyour faults, but is no incentive to your virtue. Can any man who is\r\nreally a Christian abstain from relieving one of his brethren in such\r\na miserable condition?” And at the same time, putting his hand in his\r\npocket, he gave the poor object a shilling.\r\n\r\n“Master,” cries the fellow, after thanking him, “I have a curious\r\nthing here in my pocket, which I found about two miles off, if your\r\nworship will please to buy it. I should not venture to pull it out to\r\nevery one; but, as you are so good a gentleman, and so kind to the\r\npoor, you won't suspect a man of being a thief only because he is\r\npoor.” He then pulled out a little gilt pocket-book, and delivered it\r\ninto the hands of Jones.\r\n\r\nJones presently opened it, and (guess, reader, what he felt) saw in\r\nthe first page the words Sophia Western, written by her own fair hand.\r\nHe no sooner read the name than he prest it close to his lips; nor\r\ncould he avoid falling into some very frantic raptures,\r\nnotwithstanding his company; but, perhaps, these very raptures made\r\nhim forget he was not alone.\r\n\r\nWhile Jones was kissing and mumbling the book, as if he had an\r\nexcellent brown buttered crust in his mouth or as if he had really\r\nbeen a book-worm, or an author who had nothing to eat but his own\r\nworks, a piece of paper fell from its leaves to the ground, which\r\nPartridge took up, and delivered to Jones, who presently perceived it\r\nto be a bank-bill. It was, indeed, the very bill which Western had\r\ngiven his daughter the night before her departure; and a Jew would\r\nhave jumped to purchase it at five shillings less than £100.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of Partridge sparkled at this news, which Jones now\r\nproclaimed aloud; and so did (though with somewhat a different aspect)\r\nthose of the poor fellow who had found the book; and who (I hope from\r\na principle of honesty) had never opened it: but we should not deal\r\nhonestly by the reader if we omitted to inform him of a circumstance\r\nwhich may be here a little material, viz. that the fellow could not\r\nread.\r\n\r\nJones, who had felt nothing but pure joy and transport from the\r\nfinding the book, was affected with a mixture of concern at this new\r\ndiscovery; for his imagination instantly suggested to him that the\r\nowner of the bill might possibly want it before he should be able to\r\nconvey it to her. He then acquainted the finder that he knew the lady\r\nto whom the book belonged, and would endeavour to find her out as soon\r\nas possible, and return it her.\r\n\r\nThe pocket-book was a late present from Mrs Western to her niece; it\r\nhad cost five-and-twenty shillings, having been bought of a celebrated\r\ntoyman; but the real value of the silver which it contained in its\r\nclasp was about eighteen-pence; and that price the said toyman, as it\r\nwas altogether as good as when it first issued from his shop, would\r\nnow have given for it. A prudent person would, however, have taken\r\nproper advantage of the ignorance of this fellow, and would not have\r\noffered more than a shilling, or perhaps sixpence, for it; nay, some\r\nperhaps would have given nothing, and left the fellow to his action of\r\ntrover, which some learned serjeants may doubt whether he could, under\r\nthese circumstances, have maintained.\r\n\r\nJones, on the contrary, whose character was on the outside of\r\ngenerosity, and may perhaps not very unjustly have been suspected of\r\nextravagance, without any hesitation gave a guinea in exchange for the\r\nbook. The poor man, who had not for a long time before been possessed\r\nof so much treasure, gave Mr Jones a thousand thanks, and discovered\r\nlittle less of transport in his muscles than Jones had before shown\r\nwhen he had first read the name of Sophia Western.\r\n\r\nThe fellow very readily agreed to attend our travellers to the place\r\nwhere he had found the pocket-book. Together, therefore, they\r\nproceeded directly thither; but not so fast as Mr Jones desired; for\r\nhis guide unfortunately happened to be lame, and could not possibly\r\ntravel faster than a mile an hour. As this place, therefore, was at\r\nabove three miles' distance, though the fellow had said otherwise, the\r\nreader need not be acquainted how long they were in walking it.\r\n\r\nJones opened the book a hundred times during their walk, kissed it as\r\noften, talked much to himself, and very little to his companions. At\r\nall which the guide exprest some signs of astonishment to Partridge;\r\nwho more than once shook his head, and cryed, Poor gentleman! _orandum\r\nest ut sit mens sana in corpore sano._\r\n\r\nAt length they arrived at the very spot where Sophia unhappily dropt\r\nthe pocket-book, and where the fellow had as happily found it. Here\r\nJones offered to take leave of his guide, and to improve his pace; but\r\nthe fellow, in whom that violent surprize and joy which the first\r\nreceipt of the guinea had occasioned was now considerably abated, and\r\nwho had now had sufficient time to recollect himself, put on a\r\ndiscontented look, and, scratching his head, said, “He hoped his\r\nworship would give him something more. Your worship,” said he, “will,\r\nI hope, take it into your consideration that if I had not been honest\r\nI might have kept the whole.” And, indeed, this the reader must\r\nconfess to have been true. “If the paper there,” said he, “be worth\r\n£100, I am sure the finding it deserves more than a guinea. Besides,\r\nsuppose your worship should never see the lady, nor give it her--and,\r\nthough your worship looks and talks very much like a gentleman, yet I\r\nhave only your worship's bare word; and, certainly, if the right owner\r\nben't to be found, it all belongs to the first finder. I hope your\r\nworship will consider of all these matters: I am but a poor man, and\r\ntherefore don't desire to have all; but it is but reasonable I should\r\nhave my share. Your worship looks like a good man, and, I hope, will\r\nconsider my honesty; for I might have kept every farthing, and nobody\r\never the wiser.” “I promise thee, upon my honour,” cries Jones, “that\r\nI know the right owner, and will restore it her.” “Nay, your worship,”\r\n answered the fellow, “may do as you please as to that; if you will but\r\ngive me my share, that is, one-half of the money, your honour may keep\r\nthe rest yourself if you please;” and concluded with swearing, by a\r\nvery vehement oath, “that he would never mention a syllable of it to\r\nany man living.”\r\n\r\n“Lookee, friend,” cries Jones, “the right owner shall certainly have\r\nagain all that she lost; and as for any farther gratuity, I really\r\ncannot give it you at present; but let me know your name, and where\r\nyou live, and it is more than possible you may hereafter have further\r\nreason to rejoice at this morning's adventure.”\r\n\r\n“I don't know what you mean by venture,” cries the fellow; “it seems I\r\nmust venture whether you will return the lady her money or no; but I\r\nhope your worship will consider--” “Come, come,” said Partridge, “tell\r\nhis honour your name, and where you may be found; I warrant you will\r\nnever repent having put the money into his hands.” The fellow, seeing\r\nno hopes of recovering the possession of the pocket-book, at last\r\ncomplied in giving in his name and place of abode, which Jones writ\r\nupon a piece of paper with the pencil of Sophia; and then, placing the\r\npaper in the same page where she had writ her name, he cried out,\r\n“There, friend, you are the happiest man alive; I have joined your\r\nname to that of an angel.” “I don't know anything about angels,”\r\n answered the fellow; “but I wish you would give me a little more\r\nmoney, or else return me the pocket-book.” Partridge now waxed wrath:\r\nhe called the poor cripple by several vile and opprobrious names, and\r\nwas absolutely proceeding to beat him, but Jones would not suffer any\r\nsuch thing: and now, telling the fellow he would certainly find some\r\nopportunity of serving him, Mr Jones departed as fast as his heels\r\nwould carry him; and Partridge, into whom the thoughts of the hundred\r\npound had infused new spirits, followed his leader; while the man, who\r\nwas obliged to stay behind, fell to cursing them both, as well as his\r\nparents; “for had they,” says he, “sent me to charity-school to learn\r\nto write and read and cast accounts, I should have known the value of\r\nthese matters as well as other people.”"

      "title": "Chapter v.",
      "content": "Containing more adventures which Mr Jones and his companion met on the\r\nroad.\r\n\nOur travellers now walked so fast, that they had very little time or\r\nbreath for conversation; Jones meditating all the way on Sophia, and\r\nPartridge on the bank-bill, which, though it gave him some pleasure,\r\ncaused him at the same time to repine at fortune, which, in all his\r\nwalks, had never given him such an opportunity of showing his honesty.\r\nThey had proceeded above three miles, when Partridge, being unable any\r\nlonger to keep up with Jones, called to him, and begged him a little\r\nto slacken his pace: with this he was the more ready to comply, as he\r\nhad for some time lost the footsteps of the horses, which the thaw had\r\nenabled him to trace for several miles, and he was now upon a wide\r\ncommon, where were several roads.\r\n\r\nHe here therefore stopt to consider which of these roads he should\r\npursue; when on a sudden they heard the noise of a drum, that seemed\r\nat no great distance. This sound presently alarmed the fears of\r\nPartridge, and he cried out, “Lord have mercy upon us all; they are\r\ncertainly a coming!” “Who is coming?” cries Jones; for fear had long\r\nsince given place to softer ideas in his mind; and since his adventure\r\nwith the lame man, he had been totally intent on pursuing Sophia,\r\nwithout entertaining one thought of an enemy. “Who?” cries Partridge,\r\n“why, the rebels: but why should I call them rebels? they may be very\r\nhonest gentlemen, for anything I know to the contrary. The devil take\r\nhim that affronts them, I say; I am sure, if they have nothing to say\r\nto me, I will have nothing to say to them, but in a civil way. For\r\nHeaven's sake, sir, don't affront them if they should come, and\r\nperhaps they may do us no harm; but would it not be the wiser way to\r\ncreep into some of yonder bushes, till they are gone by? What can two\r\nunarmed men do perhaps against fifty thousand? Certainly nobody but a\r\nmadman; I hope your honour is not offended; but certainly no man who\r\nhath _mens sana in corpore sano_----” Here Jones interrupted this\r\ntorrent of eloquence, which fear had inspired, saying, “That by the\r\ndrum he perceived they were near some town.” He then made directly\r\ntowards the place whence the noise proceeded, bidding Partridge “take\r\ncourage, for that he would lead him into no danger;” and adding, “it\r\nwas impossible the rebels should be so near.”\r\n\r\nPartridge was a little comforted with this last assurance; and though\r\nhe would more gladly have gone the contrary way, he followed his\r\nleader, his heart beating time, but not after the manner of heroes, to\r\nthe music of the drum, which ceased not till they had traversed the\r\ncommon, and were come into a narrow lane.\r\n\r\nAnd now Partridge, who kept even pace with Jones, discovered something\r\npainted flying in the air, a very few yards before him, which fancying\r\nto be the colours of the enemy, he fell a bellowing, “Oh Lord, sir,\r\nhere they are; there is the crown and coffin. Oh Lord! I never saw\r\nanything so terrible; and we are within gun-shot of them already.”\r\n\r\nJones no sooner looked up, than he plainly perceived what it was which\r\nPartridge had thus mistaken. “Partridge,” says he, “I fancy you will\r\nbe able to engage this whole army yourself; for by the colours I guess\r\nwhat the drum was which we heard before, and which beats up for\r\nrecruits to a puppet-show.”\r\n\r\n“A puppet-show!” answered Partridge, with most eager transport. “And\r\nis it really no more than that? I love a puppet-show of all the\r\npastimes upon earth. Do, good sir, let us tarry and see it. Besides, I\r\nam quite famished to death; for it is now almost dark, and I have not\r\neat a morsel since three o'clock in the morning.”\r\n\r\nThey now arrived at an inn, or indeed an ale-house, where Jones was\r\nprevailed upon to stop, the rather as he had no longer any assurance\r\nof being in the road he desired. They walked both directly into the\r\nkitchen, where Jones began to enquire if no ladies had passed that way\r\nin the morning, and Partridge as eagerly examined into the state of\r\ntheir provisions; and indeed his enquiry met with the better success;\r\nfor Jones could not hear news of Sophia; but Partridge, to his great\r\nsatisfaction, found good reason to expect very shortly the agreeable\r\nsight of an excellent smoaking dish of eggs and bacon.\r\n\r\nIn strong and healthy constitutions love hath a very different effect\r\nfrom what it causes in the puny part of the species. In the latter it\r\ngenerally destroys all that appetite which tends towards the\r\nconservation of the individual; but in the former, though it often\r\ninduces forgetfulness, and a neglect of food, as well as of everything\r\nelse; yet place a good piece of well-powdered buttock before a hungry\r\nlover, and he seldom fails very handsomely to play his part. Thus it\r\nhappened in the present case; for though Jones perhaps wanted a\r\nprompter, and might have travelled much farther, had he been alone,\r\nwith an empty stomach; yet no sooner did he sit down to the bacon and\r\neggs, than he fell to as heartily and voraciously as Partridge\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nBefore our travellers had finished their dinner, night came on, and as\r\nthe moon was now past the full, it was extremely dark. Partridge\r\ntherefore prevailed on Jones to stay and see the puppet-show, which\r\nwas just going to begin, and to which they were very eagerly invited\r\nby the master of the said show, who declared that his figures were the\r\nfinest which the world had ever produced, and that they had given\r\ngreat satisfaction to all the quality in every town in England.\r\n\r\nThe puppet-show was performed with great regularity and decency. It\r\nwas called the fine and serious part of the Provoked Husband; and it\r\nwas indeed a very grave and solemn entertainment, without any low wit\r\nor humour, or jests; or, to do it no more than justice, without\r\nanything which could provoke a laugh. The audience were all highly\r\npleased. A grave matron told the master she would bring her two\r\ndaughters the next night, as he did not show any stuff; and an\r\nattorney's clerk and an exciseman both declared, that the characters\r\nof Lord and Lady Townley were well preserved, and highly in nature.\r\nPartridge likewise concurred with this opinion.\r\n\r\nThe master was so highly elated with these encomiums, that he could\r\nnot refrain from adding some more of his own. He said, “The present\r\nage was not improved in anything so much as in their puppet-shows;\r\nwhich, by throwing out Punch and his wife Joan, and such idle\r\ntrumpery, were at last brought to be a rational entertainment. I\r\nremember,” said he, “when I first took to the business, there was a\r\ngreat deal of low stuff that did very well to make folks laugh; but\r\nwas never calculated to improve the morals of young people, which\r\ncertainly ought to be principally aimed at in every puppet-show: for\r\nwhy may not good and instructive lessons be conveyed this way, as well\r\nas any other? My figures are as big as the life, and they represent\r\nthe life in every particular; and I question not but people rise from\r\nmy little drama as much improved as they do from the great.” “I would\r\nby no means degrade the ingenuity of your profession,” answered Jones,\r\n“but I should have been glad to have seen my old acquaintance master\r\nPunch, for all that; and so far from improving, I think, by leaving\r\nout him and his merry wife Joan, you have spoiled your puppet-show.”\r\n\r\nThe dancer of wires conceived an immediate and high contempt for\r\nJones, from these words. And with much disdain in his countenance, he\r\nreplied, “Very probably, sir, that may be your opinion; but I have the\r\nsatisfaction to know the best judges differ from you, and it is\r\nimpossible to please every taste. I confess, indeed, some of the\r\nquality at Bath, two or three years ago, wanted mightily to bring\r\nPunch again upon the stage. I believe I lost some money for not\r\nagreeing to it; but let others do as they will; a little matter shall\r\nnever bribe me to degrade my own profession, nor will I ever willingly\r\nconsent to the spoiling the decency and regularity of my stage, by\r\nintroducing any such low stuff upon it.”\r\n\r\n“Right, friend,” cries the clerk, “you are very right. Always avoid\r\nwhat is low. There are several of my acquaintance in London, who are\r\nresolved to drive everything which is low from the stage.” “Nothing\r\ncan be more proper,” cries the exciseman, pulling his pipe from his\r\nmouth. “I remember,” added he, “(for I then lived with my lord) I was\r\nin the footman's gallery, the night when this play of the Provoked\r\nHusband was acted first. There was a great deal of low stuff in it\r\nabout a country gentleman come up to town to stand for parliament-man;\r\nand there they brought a parcel of his servants upon the stage, his\r\ncoachman I remember particularly; but the gentlemen in our gallery\r\ncould not bear anything so low, and they damned it. I observe, friend,\r\nyou have left all that matter out, and you are to be commended for\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, gentlemen,” cries Jones, “I can never maintain my opinion\r\nagainst so many; indeed, if the generality of his audience dislike\r\nhim, the learned gentleman who conducts the show might have done very\r\nright in dismissing Punch from his service.”\r\n\r\nThe master of the show then began a second harangue, and said much of\r\nthe great force of example, and how much the inferior part of mankind\r\nwould be deterred from vice, by observing how odious it was in their\r\nsuperiors; when he was unluckily interrupted by an incident, which,\r\nthough perhaps we might have omitted it at another time, we cannot\r\nhelp relating at present, but not in this chapter."

      "content": "From which it may be inferred that the best things are liable to be\r\nmisunderstood and misinterpreted.\r\n\nA violent uproar now arose in the entry, where my landlady was well\r\ncuffing her maid both with her fist and tongue. She had indeed missed\r\nthe wench from her employment, and, after a little search, had found\r\nher on the puppet-show stage in company with the Merry Andrew, and in\r\na situation not very proper to be described.\r\n\r\nThough Grace (for that was her name) had forfeited all title to\r\nmodesty; yet had she not impudence enough to deny a fact in which she\r\nwas actually surprized; she, therefore, took another turn, and\r\nattempted to mitigate the offence. “Why do you beat me in this manner,\r\nmistress?” cries the wench. “If you don't like my doings, you may turn\r\nme away. If I am a w--e” (for the other had liberally bestowed that\r\nappellation on her), “my betters are so as well as I. What was the\r\nfine lady in the puppet-show just now? I suppose she did not lie all\r\nnight out from her husband for nothing.”\r\n\r\nThe landlady now burst into the kitchen, and fell foul on both her\r\nhusband and the poor puppet-mover. “Here, husband,” says she, “you see\r\nthe consequence of harbouring these people in your house. If one doth\r\ndraw a little drink the more for them, one is hardly made amends for\r\nthe litter they make; and then to have one's house made a bawdy-house\r\nof by such lousy vermin. In short, I desire you would be gone\r\nto-morrow morning; for I will tolerate no more such doings. It is only\r\nthe way to teach our servants idleness and nonsense; for to be sure\r\nnothing better can be learned by such idle shows as these. I remember\r\nwhen puppet-shows were made of good scripture stories, as Jephthah's\r\nRash Vow, and such good things, and when wicked people were carried\r\naway by the devil. There was some sense in those matters; but as the\r\nparson told us last Sunday, nobody believes in the devil now-a-days;\r\nand here you bring about a parcel of puppets drest up like lords and\r\nladies, only to turn the heads of poor country wenches; and when their\r\nheads are once turned topsy-turvy, no wonder everything else is so.”\r\n\r\nVirgil, I think, tells us, that when the mob are assembled in a\r\nriotous and tumultuous manner, and all sorts of missile weapons fly\r\nabout, if a man of gravity and authority appears amongst them, the\r\ntumult is presently appeased, and the mob, which when collected into\r\none body, may be well compared to an ass, erect their long ears at the\r\ngrave man's discourse.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, when a set of grave men and philosophers are\r\ndisputing; when wisdom herself may in a manner be considered as\r\npresent, and administering arguments to the disputants; should a\r\ntumult arise among the mob, or should one scold, who is herself equal\r\nin noise to a mighty mob, appear among the said philosophers; their\r\ndisputes cease in a moment, wisdom no longer performs her ministerial\r\noffice, and the attention of every one is immediately attracted by the\r\nscold alone.\r\n\r\nThus the uproar aforesaid, and the arrival of the landlady, silenced\r\nthe master of the puppet-show, and put a speedy and final end to that\r\ngrave and solemn harangue, of which we have given the reader a\r\nsufficient taste already. Nothing indeed could have happened so very\r\ninopportune as this accident; the most wanton malice of fortune could\r\nnot have contrived such another stratagem to confound the poor fellow,\r\nwhile he was so triumphantly descanting on the good morals inculcated\r\nby his exhibitions. His mouth was now as effectually stopt, as that of\r\nquack must be, if, in the midst of a declamation on the great virtues\r\nof his pills and powders, the corpse of one of his martyrs should be\r\nbrought forth, and deposited before the stage, as a testimony of his\r\nskill.\r\n\r\nInstead, therefore, of answering my landlady, the puppet-show man ran\r\nout to punish his Merry Andrew; and now the moon beginning to put\r\nforth her silver light, as the poets call it (though she looked at\r\nthat time more like a piece of copper), Jones called for his\r\nreckoning, and ordered Partridge, whom my landlady had just awaked\r\nfrom a profound nap, to prepare for his journey; but Partridge, having\r\nlately carried two points, as my reader hath seen before, was\r\nemboldened to attempt a third, which was to prevail with Jones to take\r\nup a lodging that evening in the house where he then was. He\r\nintroduced this with an affected surprize at the intention which Mr\r\nJones declared of removing; and, after urging many excellent arguments\r\nagainst it, he at last insisted strongly that it could be to no manner\r\nof purpose whatever; for that, unless Jones knew which way the lady\r\nwas gone, every step he took might very possibly lead him the farther\r\nfrom her; “for you find, sir,” said he, “by all the people in the\r\nhouse, that she is not gone this way. How much better, therefore,\r\nwould it be to stay till the morning, when we may expect to meet with\r\nsomebody to enquire of?”\r\n\r\nThis last argument had indeed some effect on Jones, and while he was\r\nweighing it the landlord threw all the rhetoric of which he was master\r\ninto the same scale. “Sure, sir,” said he, “your servant gives you\r\nmost excellent advice; for who would travel by night at this time of\r\nthe year?” He then began in the usual stile to trumpet forth the\r\nexcellent accommodation which his house afforded; and my landlady\r\nlikewise opened on the occasion----But, not to detain the reader with\r\nwhat is common to every host and hostess, it is sufficient to tell him\r\nJones was at last prevailed on to stay and refresh himself with a few\r\nhours' rest, which indeed he very much wanted; for he had hardly shut\r\nhis eyes since he had left the inn where the accident of the broken\r\nhead had happened.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Jones had taken a resolution to proceed no farther that\r\nnight, he presently retired to rest, with his two bedfellows, the\r\npocket-book and the muff; but Partridge, who at several times had\r\nrefreshed himself with several naps, was more inclined to eating than\r\nto sleeping, and more to drinking than to either.\r\n\r\nAnd now the storm which Grace had raised being at an end, and my\r\nlandlady being again reconciled to the puppet-man, who on his side\r\nforgave the indecent reflections which the good woman in her passion\r\nhad cast on his performances, a face of perfect peace and tranquillity\r\nreigned in the kitchen; where sat assembled round the fire the\r\nlandlord and landlady of the house, the master of the puppet-show, the\r\nattorney's clerk, the exciseman, and the ingenious Mr Partridge; in\r\nwhich company past the agreeable conversation which will be found in\r\nthe next chapter."

      "content": "Containing a remark or two of our own and many more of the good\r\ncompany assembled in the kitchen.\r\n\nThough the pride of Partridge did not submit to acknowledge himself a\r\nservant, yet he condescended in most particulars to imitate the\r\nmanners of that rank. One instance of this was, his greatly magnifying\r\nthe fortune of his companion, as he called Jones: such is a general\r\ncustom with all servants among strangers, as none of them would\r\nwillingly be thought the attendant on a beggar: for, the higher the\r\nsituation of the master is, the higher consequently is that of the man\r\nin his own opinion; the truth of which observation appears from the\r\nbehaviour of all the footmen of the nobility.\r\n\r\nBut, though title and fortune communicate a splendor all around them,\r\nand the footmen of men of quality and of estate think themselves\r\nentitled to a part of that respect which is paid to the quality and\r\nestate of their masters, it is clearly otherwise with regard to virtue\r\nand understanding. These advantages are strictly personal, and swallow\r\nthemselves all the respect which is paid to them. To say the truth,\r\nthis is so very little, that they cannot well afford to let any others\r\npartake with them. As these therefore reflect no honour on the\r\ndomestic, so neither is he at all dishonoured by the most deplorable\r\nwant of both in his master. Indeed it is otherwise in the want of what\r\nis called virtue in a mistress, the consequence of which we have\r\nbefore seen: for in this dishonour there is a kind of contagion,\r\nwhich, like that of poverty, communicates itself to all who approach\r\nit.\r\n\r\nNow for these reasons we are not to wonder that servants (I mean among\r\nthe men only) should have so great regard for the reputation of the\r\nwealth of their masters, and little or none at all for their character\r\nin other points, and that, though they would be ashamed to be the\r\nfootman of a beggar, they are not so to attend upon a rogue or a\r\nblockhead; and do consequently make no scruple to spread the fame of\r\nthe iniquities and follies of their said masters as far as possible,\r\nand this often with great humour and merriment. In reality, a footman\r\nis often a wit as well as a beau, at the expence of the gentleman\r\nwhose livery he wears.\r\n\r\nAfter Partridge, therefore, had enlarged greatly on the vast fortune\r\nto which Mr Jones was heir, he very freely communicated an\r\napprehension, which he had begun to conceive the day before, and for\r\nwhich, as we hinted at that very time, the behaviour of Jones seemed\r\nto have furnished a sufficient foundation. In short, he was now pretty\r\nwell confirmed in an opinion that his master was out of his wits, with\r\nwhich opinion he very bluntly acquainted the good company round the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nWith this sentiment the puppet-show man immediately coincided. “I\r\nown,” said he, “the gentleman surprized me very much, when he talked\r\nso absurdly about puppet-shows. It is indeed hardly to be conceived\r\nthat any man in his senses should be so much mistaken; what you say\r\nnow accounts very well for all his monstrous notions. Poor gentleman!\r\nI am heartily concerned for him; indeed he hath a strange wildness\r\nabout his eyes, which I took notice of before, though I did not\r\nmention it.”\r\n\r\nThe landlord agreed with this last assertion, and likewise claimed the\r\nsagacity of having observed it. “And certainly,” added he, “it must be\r\nso; for no one but a madman would have thought of leaving so good a\r\nhouse to ramble about the country at that time of night.”\r\n\r\nThe exciseman, pulling his pipe from his mouth, said, “He thought the\r\ngentleman looked and talked a little wildly;” and then turning to\r\nPartridge, “if he be a madman,” says he, “he should not be suffered to\r\ntravel thus about the country; for possibly he may do some mischief.\r\nIt is a pity he was not secured and sent home to his relations.”\r\n\r\nNow some conceits of this kind were likewise lurking in the mind of\r\nPartridge; for, as he was now persuaded that Jones had run away from\r\nMr Allworthy, he promised himself the highest rewards if he could by\r\nany means convey him back. But fear of Jones, of whose fierceness and\r\nstrength he had seen, and indeed felt, some instances, had however\r\nrepresented any such scheme as impossible to be executed, and had\r\ndiscouraged him from applying himself to form any regular plan for the\r\npurpose. But no sooner did he hear the sentiments of the exciseman\r\nthan he embraced that opportunity of declaring his own, and expressed\r\na hearty wish that such a matter could be brought about.\r\n\r\n“Could be brought about!” says the exciseman: “why, there is nothing\r\neasier.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! sir,” answered Partridge, “you don't know what a devil of a\r\nfellow he is. He can take me up with one hand, and throw me out at\r\nwindow; and he would, too, if he did but imagine--”\r\n\r\n“Pogh!” says the exciseman, “I believe I am as good a man as he.\r\nBesides, here are five of us.”\r\n\r\n“I don't know what five,” cries the landlady, “my husband shall have\r\nnothing to do in it. Nor shall any violent hands be laid upon anybody\r\nin my house. The young gentleman is as pretty a young gentleman as\r\never I saw in my life, and I believe he is no more mad than any of us.\r\nWhat do you tell of his having a wild look with his eyes? they are the\r\nprettiest eyes I ever saw, and he hath the prettiest look with them;\r\nand a very modest civil young man he is. I am sure I have bepitied him\r\nheartily ever since the gentleman there in the corner told us he was\r\ncrost in love. Certainly that is enough to make any man, especially\r\nsuch a sweet young gentleman as he is, to look a little otherwise than\r\nhe did before. Lady, indeed! what the devil would the lady have better\r\nthan such a handsome man with a great estate? I suppose she is one of\r\nyour quality folks, one of your Townly ladies that we saw last night\r\nin the puppet-show, who don't know what they would be at.”\r\n\r\nThe attorney's clerk likewise declared he would have no concern in the\r\nbusiness without the advice of counsel. “Suppose,” says he, “an action\r\nof false imprisonment should be brought against us, what defence could\r\nwe make? Who knows what may be sufficient evidence of madness to a\r\njury? But I only speak upon my own account; for it don't look well for\r\na lawyer to be concerned in these matters, unless it be as a lawyer.\r\nJuries are always less favourable to us than to other people. I don't\r\ntherefore dissuade you, Mr Thomson (to the exciseman), nor the\r\ngentleman, nor anybody else.”\r\n\r\nThe exciseman shook his head at this speech, and the puppet-show man\r\nsaid, “Madness was sometimes a difficult matter for a jury to decide:\r\nfor I remember,” says he, “I was once present at a tryal of madness,\r\nwhere twenty witnesses swore that the person was as mad as a March\r\nhare; and twenty others, that he was as much in his senses as any man\r\nin England.--And indeed it was the opinion of most people, that it was\r\nonly a trick of his relations to rob the poor man of his right.”\r\n\r\n“Very likely!” cries the landlady. “I myself knew a poor gentleman who\r\nwas kept in a mad-house all his life by his family, and they enjoyed\r\nhis estate, but it did them no good; for though the law gave it them,\r\nit was the right of another.”\r\n\r\n“Pogh!” cries the clerk, with great contempt, “who hath any right but\r\nwhat the law gives them? If the law gave me the best estate in the\r\ncountry, I should never trouble myself much who had the right.”\r\n\r\n“If it be so,” says Partridge, “_Felix quem faciunt aliena pericula\r\ncautum.”_\r\n\r\nMy landlord, who had been called out by the arrival of a horseman at\r\nthe gate, now returned into the kitchen, and with an affrighted\r\ncountenance cried out, “What do you think, gentlemen? The rebels have\r\ngiven the duke the slip, and are got almost to London. It is certainly\r\ntrue, for a man on horseback just now told me so.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad of it with all my heart,” cries Partridge; “then there will\r\nbe no fighting in these parts.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad,” cries the clerk, “for a better reason; for I would always\r\nhave right take place.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, but,” answered the landlord, “I have heard some people say this\r\nman hath no right.”\r\n\r\n“I will prove the contrary in a moment,” cries the clerk: “if my\r\nfather dies seized of a right; do you mind me, seized of a right, I\r\nsay; doth not that right descend to his son; and doth not one right\r\ndescend as well as another?”\r\n\r\n“But how can he have any right to make us papishes?” says the\r\nlandlord.\r\n\r\n“Never fear that,” cries Partridge. “As to the matter of right, the\r\ngentleman there hath proved it as clear as the sun; and as to the\r\nmatter of religion, it is quite out of the case. The papists\r\nthemselves don't expect any such thing. A popish priest, whom I know\r\nvery well, and who is a very honest man, told me upon his word and\r\nhonour they had no such design.”\r\n\r\n“And another priest, of my acquaintance,” said the landlady, “hath\r\ntold me the same thing; but my husband is always so afraid of\r\npapishes. I know a great many papishes that are very honest sort of\r\npeople, and spend their money very freely; and it is always a maxim\r\nwith me, that one man's money is as good as another's.”\r\n\r\n“Very true, mistress,” said the puppet-show man, “I don't care what\r\nreligion comes; provided the Presbyterians are not uppermost; for they\r\nare enemies to puppet-shows.”\r\n\r\n“And so you would sacrifice your religion to your interest,” cries the\r\nexciseman; “and are desirous to see popery brought in, are you?”\r\n\r\n“Not I, truly,” answered the other; “I hate popery as much as any man;\r\nbut yet it is a comfort to one, that one should be able to live under\r\nit, which I could not do among Presbyterians. To be sure, every man\r\nvalues his livelihood first; that must be granted; and I warrant, if\r\nyou would confess the truth, you are more afraid of losing your place\r\nthan anything else; but never fear, friend, there will be an excise\r\nunder another government as well as under this.”\r\n\r\n“Why, certainly,” replied the exciseman, “I should be a very ill man\r\nif I did not honour the king, whose bread I eat. That is no more than\r\nnatural, as a man may say: for what signifies it to me that there\r\nwould be an excise-office under another government, since my friends\r\nwould be out, and I could expect no better than to follow them? No,\r\nno, friend, I shall never be bubbled out of my religion in hopes only\r\nof keeping my place under another government; for I should certainly\r\nbe no better, and very probably might be worse.”\r\n\r\n“Why, that is what I say,” cries the landlord, “whenever folks say who\r\nknows what may happen! Odsooks! should not I be a blockhead to lend my\r\nmoney to I know not who, because mayhap he may return it again? I am\r\nsure it is safe in my own bureau, and there I will keep it.”\r\n\r\nThe attorney's clerk had taken a great fancy to the sagacity of\r\nPartridge. Whether this proceeded from the great discernment which the\r\nformer had into men, as well as things, or whether it arose from the\r\nsympathy between their minds; for they were both truly Jacobites in\r\nprinciple; they now shook hands heartily, and drank bumpers of strong\r\nbeer to healths which we think proper to bury in oblivion.\r\n\r\nThese healths were afterwards pledged by all present, and even by my\r\nlandlord himself, though reluctantly; but he could not withstand the\r\nmenaces of the clerk, who swore he would never set his foot within his\r\nhouse again, if he refused. The bumpers which were swallowed on this\r\noccasion soon put an end to the conversation. Here, therefore, we will\r\nput an end to the chapter."

      "content": "In which fortune seems to have been in a better humour with Jones than\r\nwe have hitherto seen her.\r\n\nAs there is no wholesomer, so perhaps there are few stronger, sleeping\r\npotions than fatigue. Of this Jones might be said to have taken a very\r\nlarge dose, and it operated very forcibly upon him. He had already\r\nslept nine hours, and might perhaps have slept longer, had he not been\r\nawakened by a most violent noise at his chamber-door, where the sound\r\nof many heavy blows was accompanied with many exclamations of murder.\r\nJones presently leapt from his bed, where he found the master of the\r\npuppet-show belabouring the back and ribs of his poor Merry-Andrew,\r\nwithout either mercy or moderation.\r\n\r\nJones instantly interposed on behalf of the suffering party, and\r\npinned the insulting conqueror up to the wall: for the puppet-show man\r\nwas no more able to contend with Jones than the poor party-coloured\r\njester had been to contend with this puppet-man.\r\n\r\nBut though the Merry-Andrew was a little fellow, and not very strong,\r\nhe had nevertheless some choler about him. He therefore no sooner\r\nfound himself delivered from the enemy, than he began to attack him\r\nwith the only weapon at which he was his equal. From this he first\r\ndischarged a volley of general abusive words, and thence proceeded to\r\nsome particular accusations--“D--n your bl--d, you rascal,” says he,\r\n“I have not only supported you (for to me you owe all the money you\r\nget), but I have saved you from the gallows. Did you not want to rob\r\nthe lady of her fine riding-habit, no longer ago than yesterday, in\r\nthe back-lane here? Can you deny that you wished to have her alone in\r\na wood to strip her--to strip one of the prettiest ladies that ever\r\nwas seen in the world? and here you have fallen upon me, and have\r\nalmost murdered me, for doing no harm to a girl as willing as myself,\r\nonly because she likes me better than you.”\r\n\r\nJones no sooner heard this than he quitted the master, laying on him\r\nat the same time the most violent injunctions of forbearance from any\r\nfurther insult on the Merry-Andrew; and then taking the poor wretch\r\nwith him into his own apartment, he soon learned tidings of his\r\nSophia, whom the fellow, as he was attending his master with his drum\r\nthe day before, had seen pass by. He easily prevailed with the lad to\r\nshow him the exact place, and then having summoned Partridge, he\r\ndeparted with the utmost expedition.\r\n\r\nIt was almost eight of the clock before all matters could be got ready\r\nfor his departure: for Partridge was not in any haste, nor could the\r\nreckoning be presently adjusted; and when both these were settled and\r\nover, Jones would not quit the place before he had perfectly\r\nreconciled all differences between the master and the man.\r\n\r\nWhen this was happily accomplished, he set forwards, and was by the\r\ntrusty Merry-Andrew conducted to the spot by which Sophia had past;\r\nand then having handsomely rewarded his conductor, he again pushed on\r\nwith the utmost eagerness, being highly delighted with the\r\nextraordinary manner in which he received his intelligence. Of this\r\nPartridge was no sooner acquainted, than he, with great earnestness,\r\nbegan to prophesy, and assured Jones that he would certainly have good\r\nsuccess in the end: for, he said, “two such accidents could never have\r\nhappened to direct him after his mistress, if Providence had not\r\ndesigned to bring them together at last.” And this was the first time\r\nthat Jones lent any attention to the superstitious doctrines of his\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nThey had not gone above two miles when a violent storm of rain\r\novertook them; and, as they happened to be at the same time in sight\r\nof an ale-house, Partridge, with much earnest entreaty, prevailed with\r\nJones to enter, and weather the storm. Hunger is an enemy (if indeed\r\nit may be called one) which partakes more of the English than of the\r\nFrench disposition; for, though you subdue this never so often, it\r\nwill always rally again in time; and so it did with Partridge, who was\r\nno sooner arrived within the kitchen, than he began to ask the same\r\nquestions which he had asked the night before. The consequence of this\r\nwas an excellent cold chine being produced upon the table, upon which\r\nnot only Partridge, but Jones himself, made a very hearty breakfast,\r\nthough the latter began to grow again uneasy, as the people of the\r\nhouse could give him no fresh information concerning Sophia.\r\n\r\nTheir meal being over, Jones was again preparing to sally,\r\nnotwithstanding the violence of the storm still continued; but\r\nPartridge begged heartily for another mug; and at last casting his\r\neyes on a lad at the fire, who had entered into the kitchen, and who\r\nat that instant was looking as earnestly at him, he turned suddenly to\r\nJones, and cried, “Master, give me your hand, a single mug shan't\r\nserve the turn this bout. Why, here's more news of Madam Sophia come\r\nto town. The boy there standing by the fire is the very lad that rode\r\nbefore her. I can swear to my own plaister on his face.”--“Heavens\r\nbless you, sir,” cries the boy, “it is your own plaister sure enough;\r\nI shall have always reason to remember your goodness; for it hath\r\nalmost cured me.”\r\n\r\nAt these words Jones started from his chair, and, bidding the boy\r\nfollow him immediately, departed from the kitchen into a private\r\napartment; for, so delicate was he with regard to Sophia, that he\r\nnever willingly mentioned her name in the presence of many people;\r\nand, though he had, as it were, from the overflowings of his heart,\r\ngiven Sophia as a toast among the officers, where he thought it was\r\nimpossible she should be known; yet, even there, the reader may\r\nremember how difficultly he was prevailed upon to mention her surname.\r\n\r\nHard therefore was it, and perhaps, in the opinion of many sagacious\r\nreaders, very absurd and monstrous, that he should principally owe his\r\npresent misfortune to the supposed want of that delicacy with which he\r\nso abounded; for, in reality, Sophia was much more offended at the\r\nfreedoms which she thought (and not without good reason) he had taken\r\nwith her name and character, than at any freedoms, in which, under his\r\npresent circumstances, he had indulged himself with the person of\r\nanother woman; and to say truth, I believe Honour could never have\r\nprevailed on her to leave Upton without her seeing Jones, had it not\r\nbeen for those two strong instances of a levity in his behaviour, so\r\nvoid of respect, and indeed so highly inconsistent with any degree of\r\nlove and tenderness in great and delicate minds.\r\n\r\nBut so matters fell out, and so I must relate them; and if any reader\r\nis shocked at their appearing unnatural, I cannot help it. I must\r\nremind such persons that I am not writing a system, but a history, and\r\nI am not obliged to reconcile every matter to the received notions\r\nconcerning truth and nature. But if this was never so easy to do,\r\nperhaps it might be more prudent in me to avoid it. For instance, as\r\nthe fact at present before us now stands, without any comment of mine\r\nupon it, though it may at first sight offend some readers, yet, upon\r\nmore mature consideration, it must please all; for wise and good men\r\nmay consider what happened to Jones at Upton as a just punishment for\r\nhis wickedness with regard to women, of which it was indeed the\r\nimmediate consequence; and silly and bad persons may comfort\r\nthemselves in their vices by flattering their own hearts that the\r\ncharacters of men are rather owing to accident than to virtue. Now,\r\nperhaps the reflections which we should be here inclined to draw would\r\nalike contradict both these conclusions, and would show that these\r\nincidents contribute only to confirm the great, useful, and uncommon\r\ndoctrine, which it is the purpose of this whole work to inculcate, and\r\nwhich we must not fill up our pages by frequently repeating, as an\r\nordinary parson fills his sermon by repeating his text at the end of\r\nevery paragraph.\r\n\r\nWe are contented that it must appear, however unhappily Sophia had\r\nerred in her opinion of Jones, she had sufficient reason for her\r\nopinion; since, I believe, every other young lady would, in her\r\nsituation, have erred in the same manner. Nay, had she followed her\r\nlover at this very time, and had entered this very alehouse the moment\r\nhe was departed from it, she would have found the landlord as well\r\nacquainted with her name and person as the wench at Upton had appeared\r\nto be. For while Jones was examining his boy in whispers in an inner\r\nroom, Partridge, who had no such delicacy in his disposition, was in\r\nthe kitchen very openly catechising the other guide who had attended\r\nMrs Fitzpatrick; by which means the landlord, whose ears were open on\r\nall such occasions, became perfectly well acquainted with the tumble\r\nof Sophia from her horse, &c., with the mistake concerning Jenny\r\nCameron, with the many consequences of the punch, and, in short, with\r\nalmost everything which had happened at the inn whence we despatched\r\nour ladies in a coach-and-six when we last took our leaves of them."

      "content": "Containing little more than a few odd observations.\r\n\nJones had been absent a full half-hour, when he returned into the\r\nkitchen in a hurry, desiring the landlord to let him know that instant\r\nwhat was to pay. And now the concern which Partridge felt at being\r\nobliged to quit the warm chimney-corner, and a cup of excellent\r\nliquor, was somewhat compensated by hearing that he was to proceed no\r\nfarther on foot, for Jones, by golden arguments, had prevailed with\r\nthe boy to attend him back to the inn whither he had before conducted\r\nSophia; but to this however the lad consented, upon condition that the\r\nother guide would wait for him at the alehouse; because, as the\r\nlandlord at Upton was an intimate acquaintance of the landlord at\r\nGloucester, it might some time or other come to the ears of the latter\r\nthat his horses had been let to more than one person; and so the boy\r\nmight be brought to account for money which he wisely intended to put\r\nin his own pocket.\r\n\r\nWe were obliged to mention this circumstance, trifling as it may seem,\r\nsince it retarded Mr Jones a considerable time in his setting out; for\r\nthe honesty of this latter boy was somewhat high--that is, somewhat\r\nhigh-priced, and would indeed have cost Jones very dear, had not\r\nPartridge, who, as we have said, was a very cunning fellow, artfully\r\nthrown in half-a-crown to be spent at that very alehouse, while the\r\nboy was waiting for his companion. This half-crown the landlord no\r\nsooner got scent of, than he opened after it with such vehement and\r\npersuasive outcry, that the boy was soon overcome, and consented to\r\ntake half-a-crown more for his stay. Here we cannot help observing,\r\nthat as there is so much of policy in the lowest life, great men often\r\novervalue themselves on those refinements in imposture, in which they\r\nare frequently excelled by some of the lowest of the human species.\r\n\r\nThe horses being now produced, Jones directly leapt into the\r\nside-saddle, on which his dear Sophia had rid. The lad, indeed, very\r\ncivilly offered him the use of his; but he chose the side-saddle,\r\nprobably because it was softer. Partridge, however, though full as\r\neffeminate as Jones, could not bear the thoughts of degrading his\r\nmanhood; he therefore accepted the boy's offer: and now, Jones being\r\nmounted on the side-saddle of his Sophia, the boy on that of Mrs\r\nHonour, and Partridge bestriding the third horse, they set forwards on\r\ntheir journey, and within four hours arrived at the inn where the\r\nreader hath already spent so much time. Partridge was in very high\r\nspirits during the whole way, and often mentioned to Jones the many\r\ngood omens of his future success which had lately befriended him; and\r\nwhich the reader, without being the least superstitious, must allow to\r\nhave been particularly fortunate. Partridge was moreover better\r\npleased with the present pursuit of his companion than he had been\r\nwith his pursuit of glory; and from these very omens, which assured\r\nthe pedagogue of success, he likewise first acquired a clear idea of\r\nthe amour between Jones and Sophia; to which he had before given very\r\nlittle attention, as he had originally taken a wrong scent concerning\r\nthe reasons of Jones's departure; and as to what happened at Upton, he\r\nwas too much frightened just before and after his leaving that place\r\nto draw any other conclusions from thence than that poor Jones was a\r\ndownright madman: a conceit which was not at all disagreeable to the\r\nopinion he before had of his extraordinary wildness, of which, he\r\nthought, his behaviour on their quitting Gloucester so well justified\r\nall the accounts he had formerly received. He was now, however, pretty\r\nwell satisfied with his present expedition, and henceforth began to\r\nconceive much worthier sentiments of his friend's understanding.\r\n\r\nThe clock had just struck three when they arrived, and Jones\r\nimmediately bespoke post-horses; but unluckily there was not a horse\r\nto be procured in the whole place; which the reader will not wonder at\r\nwhen he considers the hurry in which the whole nation, and especially\r\nthis part of it, was at this time engaged, when expresses were passing\r\nand repassing every hour of the day and night.\r\n\r\nJones endeavoured all he could to prevail with his former guide to\r\nescorte him to Coventry; but he was inexorable. While he was arguing\r\nwith the boy in the inn-yard, a person came up to him, and saluting\r\nhim by his name, enquired how all the good family did in\r\nSomersetshire; and now Jones casting his eyes upon this person,\r\npresently discovered him to be Mr Dowling, the lawyer, with whom he\r\nhad dined at Gloucester, and with much courtesy returned the\r\nsalutation.\r\n\r\nDowling very earnestly pressed Mr Jones to go no further that night;\r\nand backed his solicitations with many unanswerable arguments, such\r\nas, that it was almost dark, that the roads were very dirty, and that\r\nhe would be able to travel much better by day-light, with many others\r\nequally good, some of which Jones had probably suggested to himself\r\nbefore; but as they were then ineffectual, so they were still: and he\r\ncontinued resolute in his design, even though he should be obliged to\r\nset out on foot.\r\n\r\nWhen the good attorney found he could not prevail on Jones to stay, he\r\nas strenuously applied himself to persuade the guide to accompany him.\r\nHe urged many motives to induce him to undertake this short journey,\r\nand at last concluded with saying, “Do you think the gentleman won't\r\nvery well reward you for your trouble?”\r\n\r\nTwo to one are odds at every other thing as well as at foot-ball. But\r\nthe advantage which this united force hath in persuasion or entreaty\r\nmust have been visible to a curious observer; for he must have often\r\nseen, that when a father, a master, a wife, or any other person in\r\nauthority, have stoutly adhered to a denial against all the reasons\r\nwhich a single man could produce, they have afterwards yielded to the\r\nrepetition of the same sentiments by a second or third person, who\r\nhath undertaken the cause, without attempting to advance anything new\r\nin its behalf. And hence, perhaps, proceeds the phrase of seconding an\r\nargument or a motion, and the great consequence this is of in all\r\nassemblies of public debate. Hence, likewise, probably it is, that in\r\nour courts of law we often hear a learned gentleman (generally a\r\nserjeant) repeating for an hour together what another learned\r\ngentleman, who spoke just before him, had been saying.\r\n\r\nInstead of accounting for this, we shall proceed in our usual manner\r\nto exemplify it in the conduct of the lad above mentioned, who\r\nsubmitted to the persuasions of Mr Dowling, and promised once more to\r\nadmit Jones into his side-saddle; but insisted on first giving the\r\npoor creatures a good bait, saying, they had travelled a great way,\r\nand been rid very hard. Indeed this caution of the boy was needless;\r\nfor Jones, notwithstanding his hurry and impatience, would have\r\nordered this of himself; for he by no means agreed with the opinion of\r\nthose who consider animals as mere machines, and when they bury their\r\nspurs in the belly of their horse, imagine the spur and the horse to\r\nhave an equal capacity of feeling pain.\r\n\r\nWhile the beasts were eating their corn, or rather were supposed to\r\neat it (for, as the boy was taking care of himself in the kitchen, the\r\nostler took great care that his corn should not be consumed in the\r\nstable), Mr Jones, at the earnest desire of Mr Dowling, accompanied\r\nthat gentleman into his room, where they sat down together over a\r\nbottle of wine."

      "content": "In which Mr Jones and Mr Dowling drink a bottle together.\r\n\nMr Dowling, pouring out a glass of wine, named the health of the good\r\nSquire Allworthy; adding, “If you please, sir, we will likewise\r\nremember his nephew and heir, the young squire: Come, sir, here's Mr\r\nBlifil to you, a very pretty young gentleman; and who, I dare swear,\r\nwill hereafter make a very considerable figure in his country. I have\r\na borough for him myself in my eye.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” answered Jones, “I am convinced you don't intend to affront me,\r\nso I shall not resent it; but I promise you, you have joined two\r\npersons very improperly together; for one is the glory of the human\r\nspecies, and the other is a rascal who dishonours the name of man.”\r\n\r\nDowling stared at this. He said, “He thought both the gentlemen had a\r\nvery unexceptionable character. As for Squire Allworthy himself,” says\r\nhe, “I never had the happiness to see him; but all the world talks of\r\nhis goodness. And, indeed, as to the young gentleman, I never saw him\r\nbut once, when I carried him the news of the loss of his mother; and\r\nthen I was so hurried, and drove, and tore with the multiplicity of\r\nbusiness, that I had hardly time to converse with him; but he looked\r\nso like a very honest gentleman, and behaved himself so prettily, that\r\nI protest I never was more delighted with any gentleman since I was\r\nborn.”\r\n\r\n“I don't wonder,” answered Jones, “that he should impose upon you in\r\nso short an acquaintance; for he hath the cunning of the devil\r\nhimself, and you may live with him many years, without discovering\r\nhim. I was bred up with him from my infancy, and we were hardly ever\r\nasunder; but it is very lately only that I have discovered half the\r\nvillany which is in him. I own I never greatly liked him. I thought he\r\nwanted that generosity of spirit, which is the sure foundation of all\r\nthat is great and noble in human nature. I saw a selfishness in him\r\nlong ago which I despised; but it is lately, very lately, that I have\r\nfound him capable of the basest and blackest designs; for, indeed, I\r\nhave at last found out, that he hath taken an advantage of the\r\nopenness of my own temper, and hath concerted the deepest project, by\r\na long train of wicked artifice, to work my ruin, which at last he\r\nhath effected.”\r\n\r\n“Ay! ay!” cries Dowling; “I protest, then, it is a pity such a person\r\nshould inherit the great estate of your uncle Allworthy.”\r\n\r\n“Alas, sir,” cries Jones, “you do me an honour to which I have no\r\ntitle. It is true, indeed, his goodness once allowed me the liberty of\r\ncalling him by a much nearer name; but as this was only a voluntary\r\nact of goodness, I can complain of no injustice when he thinks proper\r\nto deprive me of this honour; since the loss cannot be more unmerited\r\nthan the gift originally was. I assure you, sir, I am no relation of\r\nMr Allworthy; and if the world, who are incapable of setting a true\r\nvalue on his virtue, should think, in his behaviour to me, he hath\r\ndealt hardly by a relation, they do an injustice to the best of men:\r\nfor I--but I ask your pardon, I shall trouble you with no particulars\r\nrelating to myself; only as you seemed to think me a relation of Mr\r\nAllworthy, I thought proper to set you right in a matter that might\r\ndraw some censures upon him, which I promise you I would rather lose\r\nmy life than give occasion to.”\r\n\r\n“I protest, sir,” cried Dowling, “you talk very much like a man of\r\nhonour; but instead of giving me any trouble, I protest it would give\r\nme great pleasure to know how you came to be thought a relation of Mr\r\nAllworthy's, if you are not. Your horses won't be ready this\r\nhalf-hour, and as you have sufficient opportunity, I wish you would\r\ntell me how all that happened; for I protest it seems very surprizing\r\nthat you should pass for a relation of a gentleman, without being so.”\r\n\r\nJones, who in the compliance of his disposition (though not in his\r\nprudence) a little resembled his lovely Sophia, was easily prevailed\r\non to satisfy Mr Dowling's curiosity, by relating the history of his\r\nbirth and education, which he did, like Othello.\r\n\r\n ------Even from his boyish years,\r\n To th' very moment he was bad to tell:\r\n\r\nthe which to hear, Dowling, like Desdemona, did seriously incline;\r\n\r\n He swore 'twas strange, 'twas passing strange;\r\n 'Twas pitiful, 'twas wonderous pitiful.\r\n\r\nMr Dowling was indeed very greatly affected with this relation; for he\r\nhad not divested himself of humanity by being an attorney. Indeed,\r\nnothing is more unjust than to carry our prejudices against a\r\nprofession into private life, and to borrow our idea of a man from our\r\nopinion of his calling. Habit, it is true, lessens the horror of those\r\nactions which the profession makes necessary, and consequently\r\nhabitual; but in all other instances, Nature works in men of all\r\nprofessions alike; nay, perhaps, even more strongly with those who\r\ngive her, as it were, a holiday, when they are following their\r\nordinary business. A butcher, I make no doubt, would feel compunction\r\nat the slaughter of a fine horse; and though a surgeon can feel no\r\npain in cutting off a limb, I have known him compassionate a man in a\r\nfit of the gout. The common hangman, who hath stretched the necks of\r\nhundreds, is known to have trembled at his first operation on a head:\r\nand the very professors of human blood-shedding, who, in their trade\r\nof war, butcher thousands, not only of their fellow-professors, but\r\noften of women and children, without remorse; even these, I say, in\r\ntimes of peace, when drums and trumpets are laid aside, often lay\r\naside all their ferocity, and become very gentle members of civil\r\nsociety. In the same manner an attorney may feel all the miseries and\r\ndistresses of his fellow-creatures, provided he happens not to be\r\nconcerned against them.\r\n\r\nJones, as the reader knows, was yet unacquainted with the very black\r\ncolours in which he had been represented to Mr Allworthy; and as to\r\nother matters, he did not shew them in the most disadvantageous light;\r\nfor though he was unwilling to cast any blame on his former friend and\r\npatron; yet he was not very desirous of heaping too much upon himself.\r\nDowling therefore observed, and not without reason, that very ill\r\noffices must have been done him by somebody: “For certainly,” cries\r\nhe, “the squire would never have disinherited you only for a few\r\nfaults, which any young gentleman might have committed. Indeed, I\r\ncannot properly say disinherited: for to be sure by law you cannot\r\nclaim as heir. That's certain; that nobody need go to counsel for. Yet\r\nwhen a gentleman had in a manner adopted you thus as his own son, you\r\nmight reasonably have expected some very considerable part, if not the\r\nwhole; nay, if you had expected the whole, I should not have blamed\r\nyou: for certainly all men are for getting as much as they can, and\r\nthey are not to be blamed on that account.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed you wrong me,” said Jones; “I should have been contented with\r\nvery little: I never had any view upon Mr Allworthy's fortune; nay, I\r\nbelieve I may truly say, I never once considered what he could or\r\nmight give me. This I solemnly declare, if he had done a prejudice to\r\nhis nephew in my favour, I would have undone it again. I had rather\r\nenjoy my own mind than the fortune of another man. What is the poor\r\npride arising from a magnificent house, a numerous equipage, a\r\nsplendid table, and from all the other advantages or appearances of\r\nfortune, compared to the warm, solid content, the swelling\r\nsatisfaction, the thrilling transports, and the exulting triumphs,\r\nwhich a good mind enjoys, in the contemplation of a generous,\r\nvirtuous, noble, benevolent action? I envy not Blifil in the prospect\r\nof his wealth; nor shall I envy him in the possession of it. I would\r\nnot think myself a rascal half an hour, to exchange situations. I\r\nbelieve, indeed, Mr Blifil suspected me of the views you mention; and\r\nI suppose these suspicions, as they arose from the baseness of his own\r\nheart, so they occasioned his baseness to me. But, I thank Heaven, I\r\nknow, I feel--I feel my innocence, my friend; and I would not part\r\nwith that feeling for the world. For as long as I know I have never\r\ndone, nor even designed, an injury to any being whatever,\r\n\r\n _Pone me pigris ubi nulla campis\r\n Arbor aestiva recreatur aura,\r\n Quod latus mundi nebulae, malusque\r\n Jupiter urget.\r\n\r\n Pone sub curru nimium propinqui\r\n Solis in terra dominibus negata;\r\n Dulce ridentem Lalagen amabo,\r\n Dulce loquentem._[*]\r\n\r\n [*] Place me where never summer breeze\r\n Unbinds the glebe, or warms the trees:\r\n Where ever-lowering clouds appear,\r\n And angry Jove deforms th' inclement year.\r\n\r\n Place me beneath the burning ray,\r\n Where rolls the rapid car of day;\r\n Love and the nymph shall charm my toils,\r\n The nymph who sweetly speaks, and sweetly smiles.\r\n MR FRANCIS.\r\n\r\nHe then filled a bumper of wine, and drunk it off to the health of his\r\ndear Lalage; and, filling Dowling's glass likewise up to the brim,\r\ninsisted on his pledging him. “Why, then, here's Miss Lalage's health\r\nwith all my heart,” cries Dowling. “I have heard her toasted often, I\r\nprotest, though I never saw her; but they say she's extremely\r\nhandsome.”\r\n\r\nThough the Latin was not the only part of this speech which Dowling\r\ndid not perfectly understand; yet there was somewhat in it that made a\r\nvery strong impression upon him. And though he endeavoured by winking,\r\nnodding, sneering, and grinning, to hide the impression from Jones\r\n(for we are as often ashamed of thinking right as of thinking wrong),\r\nit is certain he secretly approved as much of his sentiments as he\r\nunderstood, and really felt a very strong impulse of compassion for\r\nhim. But we may possibly take some other opportunity of commenting\r\nupon this, especially if we should happen to meet Mr Dowling any more\r\nin the course of our history. At present we are obliged to take our\r\nleave of that gentleman a little abruptly, in imitation of Mr Jones;\r\nwho was no sooner informed, by Partridge, that his horses were ready,\r\nthan he deposited his reckoning, wished his companion a good night,\r\nmounted, and set forward towards Coventry, though the night was dark,\r\nand it just then began to rain very hard."

      "content": "The disasters which befel Jones on his departure for Coventry; with\r\nthe sage remarks of Partridge.\r\n\nNo road can be plainer than that from the place where they now were to\r\nCoventry; and though neither Jones, nor Partridge, nor the guide, had\r\never travelled it before, it would have been almost impossible to have\r\nmissed their way, had it not been for the two reasons mentioned in the\r\nconclusion of the last chapter.\r\n\r\nThese two circumstances, however, happening both unfortunately to\r\nintervene, our travellers deviated into a much less frequented track;\r\nand after riding full six miles, instead of arriving at the stately\r\nspires of Coventry, they found themselves still in a very dirty lane,\r\nwhere they saw no symptoms of approaching the suburbs of a large city.\r\n\r\nJones now declared that they must certainly have lost their way; but\r\nthis the guide insisted upon was impossible; a word which, in common\r\nconversation, is often used to signify not only improbable, but often\r\nwhat is really very likely, and, sometimes, what hath certainly\r\nhappened; an hyperbolical violence like that which is so frequently\r\noffered to the words infinite and eternal; by the former of which it\r\nis usual to express a distance of half a yard, and by the latter, a\r\nduration of five minutes. And thus it is as usual to assert the\r\nimpossibility of losing what is already actually lost. This was, in\r\nfact, the case at present; for, notwithstanding all the confident\r\nassertions of the lad to the contrary, it is certain they were no more\r\nin the right road to Coventry, than the fraudulent, griping, cruel,\r\ncanting miser is in the right road to heaven.\r\n\r\nIt is not, perhaps, easy for a reader, who hath never been in those\r\ncircumstances, to imagine the horror with which darkness, rain, and\r\nwind, fill persons who have lost their way in the night; and who,\r\nconsequently, have not the pleasant prospect of warm fires, dry\r\ncloaths, and other refreshments, to support their minds in struggling\r\nwith the inclemencies of the weather. A very imperfect idea of this\r\nhorror will, however, serve sufficiently to account for the conceits\r\nwhich now filled the head of Partridge, and which we shall presently\r\nbe obliged to open.\r\n\r\nJones grew more and more positive that they were out of their road;\r\nand the boy himself at last acknowledged he believed they were not in\r\nthe right road to Coventry; though he affirmed, at the same time, it\r\nwas impossible they should have mist the way. But Partridge was of a\r\ndifferent opinion. He said, “When they first set out he imagined some\r\nmischief or other would happen.--Did not you observe, sir,” said he to\r\nJones, “that old woman who stood at the door just as you was taking\r\nhorse? I wish you had given her a small matter, with all my heart; for\r\nshe said then you might repent it; and at that very instant it began\r\nto rain, and the wind hath continued rising ever since. Whatever some\r\npeople may think, I am very certain it is in the power of witches to\r\nraise the wind whenever they please. I have seen it happen very often\r\nin my time: and if ever I saw a witch in all my life, that old woman\r\nwas certainly one. I thought so to myself at that very time; and if I\r\nhad had any halfpence in my pocket, I would have given her some; for\r\nto be sure it is always good to be charitable to those sort of people,\r\nfor fear what may happen; and many a person hath lost his cattle by\r\nsaving a halfpenny.”\r\n\r\nJones, though he was horridly vexed at the delay which this mistake\r\nwas likely to occasion in his journey, could not help smiling at the\r\nsuperstition of his friend, whom an accident now greatly confirmed in\r\nhis opinion. This was a tumble from his horse; by which, however, he\r\nreceived no other injury than what the dirt conferred on his cloaths.\r\n\r\nPartridge had no sooner recovered his legs, than he appealed to his\r\nfall, as conclusive evidence of all he had asserted; but Jones finding\r\nhe was unhurt, answered with a smile: “This witch of yours, Partridge,\r\nis a most ungrateful jade, and doth not, I find, distinguish her\r\nfriends from others in her resentment. If the old lady had been angry\r\nwith me for neglecting her, I don't see why she should tumble you from\r\nyour horse, after all the respect you have expressed for her.”\r\n\r\n“It is ill jesting,” cries Partridge, “with people who have power to\r\ndo these things; for they are often very malicious. I remember a\r\nfarrier, who provoked one of them, by asking her when the time she had\r\nbargained with the devil for would be out; and within three months\r\nfrom that very day one of his best cows was drowned. Nor was she\r\nsatisfied with that; for a little time afterwards he lost a barrel of\r\nbest-drink: for the old witch pulled out the spigot, and let it run\r\nall over the cellar, the very first evening he had tapped it to make\r\nmerry with some of his neighbours. In short, nothing ever thrived with\r\nhim afterwards; for she worried the poor man so, that he took to\r\ndrinking; and in a year or two his stock was seized, and he and his\r\nfamily are now come to the parish.”\r\n\r\nThe guide, and perhaps his horse too, were both so attentive to this\r\ndiscourse, that, either through want of care, or by the malice of the\r\nwitch, they were now both sprawling in the dirt.\r\n\r\nPartridge entirely imputed this fall, as he had done his own, to the\r\nsame cause. He told Mr Jones, “It would certainly be his turn next;\r\nand earnestly entreated him to return back, and find out the old\r\nwoman, and pacify her. We shall very soon,” added he, “reach the inn;\r\nfor though we have seemed to go forward, I am very certain we are in\r\nthe identical place in which we were an hour ago; and I dare swear, if\r\nit was daylight, we might now see the inn we set out from.”\r\n\r\nInstead of returning any answer to this sage advice, Jones was\r\nentirely attentive to what had happened to the boy, who received no\r\nother hurt than what had before befallen Partridge, and which his\r\ncloaths very easily bore, as they had been for many years inured to\r\nthe like. He soon regained his side-saddle, and by the hearty curses\r\nand blows which he bestowed on his horse, quickly satisfied Mr Jones\r\nthat no harm was done."

      "content": "Relates that Mr Jones continued his journey, contrary to the advice of\r\nPartridge, with what happened on that occasion.\r\n\nThey now discovered a light at some distance, to the great pleasure of\r\nJones, and to the no small terror of Partridge, who firmly believed\r\nhimself to be bewitched, and that this light was a Jack-with-a-lantern,\r\nor somewhat more mischievous.\r\n\r\nBut how were these fears increased, when, as they approached nearer to\r\nthis light (or lights as they now appeared), they heard a confused\r\nsound of human voices; of singing, laughing, and hallowing, together\r\nwith a strange noise that seemed to proceed from some instruments; but\r\ncould hardly be allowed the name of music! indeed, to favour a little\r\nthe opinion of Partridge, it might very well be called music\r\nbewitched.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to conceive a much greater degree of horror than what\r\nnow seized on Partridge; the contagion of which had reached the\r\npost-boy, who had been very attentive to many things that the other\r\nhad uttered. He now, therefore, joined in petitioning Jones to return;\r\nsaying he firmly believed what Partridge had just before said, that\r\nthough the horses seemed to go on, they had not moved a step forwards\r\nduring at least the last half-hour.\r\n\r\nJones could not help smiling in the midst of his vexation, at the\r\nfears of these poor fellows. “Either we advance,” says he, “towards\r\nthe lights, or the lights have advanced towards us; for we are now at\r\na very little distance from them; but how can either of you be afraid\r\nof a set of people who appear only to be merry-making?”\r\n\r\n“Merry-making, sir!” cries Partridge; “who could be merry-making at\r\nthis time of night, and in such a place, and such weather? They can be\r\nnothing but ghosts or witches, or some evil spirits or other, that's\r\ncertain.”\r\n\r\n“Let them be what they will,” cries Jones, “I am resolved to go up to\r\nthem, and enquire the way to Coventry. All witches, Partridge, are not\r\nsuch ill-natured hags as that we had the misfortune to meet with\r\nlast.”\r\n\r\n“O Lord, sir,” cries Partridge, “there is no knowing what humour they\r\nwill be in; to be sure it is always best to be civil to them; but what\r\nif we should meet with something worse than witches, with evil spirits\r\nthemselves?----Pray, sir, be advised; pray, sir, do. If you had read\r\nso many terrible accounts as I have of these matters, you would not be\r\nso fool-hardy.----The Lord knows whither we have got already, or\r\nwhither we are going; for sure such darkness was never seen upon\r\nearth, and I question whether it can be darker in the other world.”\r\n\r\nJones put forwards as fast as he could, notwithstanding all these\r\nhints and cautions, and poor Partridge was obliged to follow; for\r\nthough he hardly dared to advance, he dared still less to stay behind\r\nby himself.\r\n\r\nAt length they arrived at the place whence the lights and different\r\nnoises had issued. This Jones perceived to be no other than a barn,\r\nwhere a great number of men and women were assembled, and diverting\r\nthemselves with much apparent jollity.\r\n\r\nJones no sooner appeared before the great doors of the barn, which\r\nwere open, than a masculine and very rough voice from within demanded,\r\nwho was there?--To which Jones gently answered, a friend; and\r\nimmediately asked the road to Coventry.\r\n\r\n“If you are a friend,” cries another of the men in the barn, “you had\r\nbetter alight till the storm is over” (for indeed it was now more\r\nviolent than ever;) “you are very welcome to put up your horse; for\r\nthere is sufficient room for him at the end of the barn.”\r\n\r\n“You are very obliging,” returned Jones; “and I will accept your offer\r\nfor a few minutes, whilst the rain continues; and here are two more\r\nwho will be glad of the same favour.” This was accorded with more\r\ngood-will than it was accepted: for Partridge would rather have\r\nsubmitted to the utmost inclemency of the weather than have trusted to\r\nthe clemency of those whom he took for hobgoblins; and the poor\r\npost-boy was now infected with the same apprehensions; but they were\r\nboth obliged to follow the example of Jones; the one because he durst\r\nnot leave his horse, and the other because he feared nothing so much\r\nas being left by himself.\r\n\r\nHad this history been writ in the days of superstition, I should have\r\nhad too much compassion for the reader to have left him so long in\r\nsuspense, whether Beelzebub or Satan was about actually to appear in\r\nperson, with all his hellish retinue; but as these doctrines are at\r\npresent very unfortunate, and have but few, if any believers, I have\r\nnot been much aware of conveying any such terrors. To say truth, the\r\nwhole furniture of the infernal regions hath long been appropriated by\r\nthe managers of playhouses, who seem lately to have laid them by as\r\nrubbish, capable only of affecting the upper gallery; a place in which\r\nfew of our readers ever sit.\r\n\r\nHowever, though we do not suspect raising any great terror on this\r\noccasion, we have reason to fear some other apprehensions may here\r\narise in our reader, into which we would not willingly betray him; I\r\nmean that we are going to take a voyage into fairy-land, and introduce\r\na set of beings into our history, which scarce any one was ever\r\nchildish enough to believe, though many have been foolish enough to\r\nspend their time in writing and reading their adventures.\r\n\r\nTo prevent, therefore, any such suspicions, so prejudicial to the\r\ncredit of an historian, who professes to draw his materials from\r\nnature only, we shall now proceed to acquaint the reader who these\r\npeople were, whose sudden appearance had struck such terrors into\r\nPartridge, had more than half frightened the post-boy, and had a\r\nlittle surprized even Mr Jones himself.\r\n\r\nThe people then assembled in this barn were no other than a company of\r\nEgyptians, or, as they are vulgarly called, gypsies, and they were now\r\ncelebrating the wedding of one of their society.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to conceive a happier set of people than appeared\r\nhere to be met together. The utmost mirth, indeed, shewed itself in\r\nevery countenance; nor was their ball totally void of all order and\r\ndecorum. Perhaps it had more than a country assembly is sometimes\r\nconducted with: for these people are subject to a formal government\r\nand laws of their own, and all pay obedience to one great magistrate,\r\nwhom they call their king.\r\n\r\nGreater plenty, likewise, was nowhere to be seen than what flourished\r\nin this barn. Here was indeed no nicety nor elegance, nor did the keen\r\nappetite of the guests require any. Here was good store of bacon,\r\nfowls, and mutton, to which every one present provided better sauce\r\nhimself than the best and dearest French cook can prepare.\r\n\r\nAeneas is not described under more consternation in the temple of\r\nJuno,\r\n\r\n_Dum stupet obtutuque haeret defixus in uno_,\r\n\r\nthan was our heroe at what he saw in this barn. While he was looking\r\neverywhere round him with astonishment, a venerable person approached\r\nhim with many friendly salutations, rather of too hearty a kind to be\r\ncalled courtly. This was no other than the king of the gypsies\r\nhimself. He was very little distinguished in dress from his subjects,\r\nnor had he any regalia of majesty to support his dignity; and yet\r\nthere seemed (as Mr Jones said) to be somewhat in his air which\r\ndenoted authority, and inspired the beholders with an idea of awe and\r\nrespect; though all this was perhaps imaginary in Jones; and the truth\r\nmay be, that such ideas are incident to power, and almost inseparable\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nThere was somewhat in the open countenance and courteous behaviour of\r\nJones which, being accompanied with much comeliness of person, greatly\r\nrecommended him at first sight to every beholder. These were, perhaps,\r\na little heightened in the present instance, by that profound respect\r\nwhich he paid to the king of the gypsies, the moment he was acquainted\r\nwith his dignity, and which was the sweeter to his gypseian majesty,\r\nas he was not used to receive such homage from any but his own\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nThe king ordered a table to be spread with the choicest of their\r\nprovisions for his accommodation; and, having placed himself at his\r\nright hand, his majesty began to discourse with our heroe in the\r\nfollowing manner:--\r\n\r\n“Me doubt not, sir, but you have often seen some of my people, who are\r\nwhat you call de parties detache: for dey go about everywhere; but me\r\nfancy you imagine not we be so considrable body as we be; and may be\r\nyou will be surprize more when you hear de gypsy be as orderly and\r\nwell govern people as any upon face of de earth.\r\n\r\n“Me have honour, as me say, to be deir king, and no monarch can do\r\nboast of more dutiful subject, ne no more affectionate. How far me\r\ndeserve deir good-will, me no say; but dis me can say, dat me never\r\ndesign anyting but to do dem good. Me sall no do boast of dat neider:\r\nfor what can me do oderwise dan consider of de good of dose poor\r\npeople who go about all day to give me always de best of what dey get.\r\nDey love and honour me darefore, because me do love and take care of\r\ndem; dat is all, me know no oder reason.\r\n\r\n“About a tousand or two tousand year ago, me cannot tell to a year or\r\ntwo, as can neider write nor read, dere was a great what you call--a\r\nvolution among de gypsy; for dere was de lord gypsy in dose days; and\r\ndese lord did quarrel vid one anoder about de place; but de king of de\r\ngypsy did demolish dem all, and made all his subject equal vid each\r\noder; and since dat time dey have agree very well; for dey no tink of\r\nbeing king, and may be it be better for dem as dey be; for me assure\r\nyou it be ver troublesome ting to be king, and always to do justice;\r\nme have often wish to be de private gypsy when me have been forced to\r\npunish my dear friend and relation; for dough we never put to death,\r\nour punishments be ver severe. Dey make de gypsy ashamed of demselves,\r\nand dat be ver terrible punishment; me ave scarce ever known de gypsy\r\nso punish do harm any more.”\r\n\r\nThe king then proceeded to express some wonder that there was no such\r\npunishment as shame in other governments. Upon which Jones assured him\r\nto the contrary; for that there were many crimes for which shame was\r\ninflicted by the English laws, and that it was indeed one consequence\r\nof all punishment. “Dat be ver strange,” said the king; “for me know\r\nand hears good deal of your people, dough me no live among dem; and me\r\nhave often hear dat sham is de consequence and de cause too of many of\r\nyour rewards. Are your rewards and punishments den de same ting?”\r\n\r\nWhile his majesty was thus discoursing with Jones, a sudden uproar\r\narose in the barn, and as it seems upon this occasion:--the courtesy\r\nof these people had by degrees removed all the apprehensions of\r\nPartridge, and he was prevailed upon not only to stuff himself with\r\ntheir food, but to taste some of their liquors, which by degrees\r\nentirely expelled all fear from his composition, and in its stead\r\nintroduced much more agreeable sensations.\r\n\r\nA young female gypsy, more remarkable for her wit than her beauty, had\r\ndecoyed the honest fellow aside, pretending to tell his fortune. Now,\r\nwhen they were alone together in a remote part of the barn, whether it\r\nproceeded from the strong liquor, which is never so apt to inflame\r\ninordinate desire as after moderate fatigue; or whether the fair gypsy\r\nherself threw aside the delicacy and decency of her sex, and tempted\r\nthe youth Partridge with express solicitations; but they were\r\ndiscovered in a very improper manner by the husband of the gypsy, who,\r\nfrom jealousy it seems, had kept a watchful eye over his wife, and had\r\ndogged her to the place, where he found her in the arms of her\r\ngallant.\r\n\r\nTo the great confusion of Jones, Partridge was now hurried before the\r\nking; who heard the accusation, and likewise the culprit's defence,\r\nwhich was indeed very trifling; for the poor fellow was confounded by\r\nthe plain evidence which appeared against him, and had very little to\r\nsay for himself. His majesty, then turning towards Jones, said, “Sir,\r\nyou have hear what dey say; what punishment do you tink your man\r\ndeserve?”\r\n\r\nJones answered, “He was sorry for what had happened, and that\r\nPartridge should make the husband all the amends in his power: he\r\nsaid, he had very little money about him at that time;” and, putting\r\nhis hand into his pocket, offered the fellow a guinea. To which he\r\nimmediately answered, “He hoped his honour would not think of giving\r\nhim less than five.”\r\n\r\nThis sum, after some altercation, was reduced to two; and Jones,\r\nhaving stipulated for the full forgiveness of both Partridge and the\r\nwife, was going to pay the money; when his majesty, restraining his\r\nhand, turned to the witness and asked him, “At what time he had\r\ndiscovered the criminals?” To which he answered, “That he had been\r\ndesired by the husband to watch the motions of his wife from her first\r\nspeaking to the stranger, and that he had never lost sight of her\r\nafterwards till the crime had been committed.” The king then asked,\r\n“if the husband was with him all that time in his lurking-place?” To\r\nwhich he answered in the affirmative. His Egyptian majesty then\r\naddressed himself to the husband as follows: “Me be sorry to see any\r\ngypsy dat have no more honour dan to sell de honour of his wife for\r\nmoney. If you had de love for your wife, you would have prevented dis\r\nmatter, and not endeavour to make her de whore dat you might discover\r\nher. Me do order dat you have no money given you, for you deserve\r\npunishment, not reward; me do order derefore, dat you be de infamous\r\ngypsy, and do wear pair of horns upon your forehead for one month, and\r\ndat your wife be called de whore, and pointed at all dat time; for you\r\nbe de infamous gypsy, but she be no less de infamous whore.”\r\n\r\nThe gypsies immediately proceeded to execute the sentence, and left\r\nJones and Partridge alone with his majesty.\r\n\r\nJones greatly applauded the justice of the sentence: upon which the\r\nking, turning to him, said, “Me believe you be surprize: for me\r\nsuppose you have ver bad opinion of my people; me suppose you tink us\r\nall de tieves.”\r\n\r\n“I must confess, sir,” said Jones, “I have not heard so favourable an\r\naccount of them as they seem to deserve.”\r\n\r\n“Me vil tell you,” said the king, “how the difference is between you\r\nand us. My people rob your people, and your people rob one anoder.”\r\n\r\nJones afterwards proceeded very gravely to sing forth the happiness of\r\nthose subjects who live under such a magistrate.\r\n\r\nIndeed their happiness appears to have been so compleat, that we are\r\naware lest some advocate for arbitrary power should hereafter quote\r\nthe case of those people, as an instance of the great advantages which\r\nattend that government above all others.\r\n\r\nAnd here we will make a concession, which would not perhaps have been\r\nexpected from us, that no limited form of government is capable of\r\nrising to the same degree of perfection, or of producing the same\r\nbenefits to society, with this. Mankind have never been so happy, as\r\nwhen the greatest part of the then known world was under the dominion\r\nof a single master; and this state of their felicity continued during\r\nthe reigns of five successive princes.[*] This was the true aera of\r\nthe golden age, and the only golden age which ever had any existence,\r\nunless in the warm imaginations of the poets, from the expulsion from\r\nEden down to this day.\r\n\r\n [*] Nerva, Trajan, Adrian, and the two Antonini.\r\n\r\nIn reality, I know but of one solid objection to absolute monarchy.\r\nThe only defect in which excellent constitution seems to be, the\r\ndifficulty of finding any man adequate to the office of an absolute\r\nmonarch: for this indispensably requires three qualities very\r\ndifficult, as it appears from history, to be found in princely\r\nnatures: first, a sufficient quantity of moderation in the prince, to\r\nbe contented with all the power which is possible for him to have.\r\n2ndly, Enough of wisdom to know his own happiness. And, 3rdly,\r\nGoodness sufficient to support the happiness of others, when not only\r\ncompatible with, but instrumental to his own.\r\n\r\nNow if an absolute monarch, with all these great and rare\r\nqualifications, should be allowed capable of conferring the greatest\r\ngood on society; it must be surely granted, on the contrary, that\r\nabsolute power, vested in the hands of one who is deficient in them\r\nall, is likely to be attended with no less a degree of evil.\r\n\r\nIn short, our own religion furnishes us with adequate ideas of the\r\nblessing, as well as curse, which may attend absolute power. The\r\npictures of heaven and of hell will place a very lively image of both\r\nbefore our eyes; for though the prince of the latter can have no power\r\nbut what he originally derives from the omnipotent Sovereign in the\r\nformer, yet it plainly appears from Scripture that absolute power in\r\nhis infernal dominions is granted to their diabolical ruler. This is\r\nindeed the only absolute power which can by Scripture be derived from\r\nheaven. If, therefore, the several tyrannies upon earth can prove any\r\ntitle to a Divine authority, it must be derived from this original\r\ngrant to the prince of darkness; and these subordinate deputations\r\nmust consequently come immediately from him whose stamp they so\r\nexpressly bear.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, as the examples of all ages shew us that mankind in\r\ngeneral desire power only to do harm, and, when they obtain it, use it\r\nfor no other purpose; it is not consonant with even the least degree\r\nof prudence to hazard an alteration, where our hopes are poorly kept\r\nin countenance by only two or three exceptions out of a thousand\r\ninstances to alarm our fears. In this case it will be much wiser to\r\nsubmit to a few inconveniencies arising from the dispassionate\r\ndeafness of laws, than to remedy them by applying to the passionate\r\nopen ears of a tyrant.\r\n\r\nNor can the example of the gypsies, though possibly they may have long\r\nbeen happy under this form of government, be here urged; since we must\r\nremember the very material respect in which they differ from all other\r\npeople, and to which perhaps this their happiness is entirely owing,\r\nnamely, that they have no false honours among them, and that they look\r\non shame as the most grievous punishment in the world."

      "content": "A dialogue between Jones and Partridge.\r\n\nThe honest lovers of liberty will, we doubt not, pardon that long\r\ndigression into which we were led at the close of the last chapter, to\r\nprevent our history from being applied to the use of the most\r\npernicious doctrine which priestcraft had ever the wickedness or the\r\nimpudence to preach.\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed with Mr Jones, who, when the storm was over, took\r\nleave of his Egyptian majesty, after many thanks for his courteous\r\nbehaviour and kind entertainment, and set out for Coventry; to which\r\nplace (for it was still dark) a gypsy was ordered to conduct him.\r\n\r\nJones having, by reason of his deviation, travelled eleven miles\r\ninstead of six, and most of those through very execrable roads, where\r\nno expedition could have been made in quest of a midwife, did not\r\narrive at Coventry till near twelve. Nor could he possibly get again\r\ninto the saddle till past two; for post-horses were now not easy to\r\nget; nor were the hostler or post-boy in half so great a hurry as\r\nhimself, but chose rather to imitate the tranquil disposition of\r\nPartridge; who, being denied the nourishment of sleep, took all\r\nopportunities to supply its place with every other kind of\r\nnourishment, and was never better pleased than when he arrived at an\r\ninn, nor ever more dissatisfied than when he was again forced to leave\r\nit.\r\n\r\nJones now travelled post; we will follow him, therefore, according to\r\nour custom, and to the rules of Longinus, in the same manner. From\r\nCoventry he arrived at Daventry, from Daventry at Stratford, and from\r\nStratford at Dunstable, whither he came the next day a little after\r\nnoon, and within a few hours after Sophia had left it; and though he\r\nwas obliged to stay here longer than he wished, while a smith, with\r\ngreat deliberation, shoed the post-horse he was to ride, he doubted\r\nnot but to overtake his Sophia before she should set out from St\r\nAlbans; at which place he concluded, and very reasonably, that his\r\nlordship would stop and dine.\r\n\r\nAnd had he been right in this conjecture, he most probably would have\r\novertaken his angel at the aforesaid place; but unluckily my lord had\r\nappointed a dinner to be prepared for him at his own house in London,\r\nand, in order to enable him to reach that place in proper time, he had\r\nordered a relay of horses to meet him at St Albans. When Jones\r\ntherefore arrived there, he was informed that the coach-and-six had\r\nset out two hours before.\r\n\r\nIf fresh post-horses had been now ready, as they were not, it seemed\r\nso apparently impossible to overtake the coach before it reached\r\nLondon, that Partridge thought he had now a proper opportunity to\r\nremind his friend of a matter which he seemed entirely to have\r\nforgotten; what this was the reader will guess, when we inform him\r\nthat Jones had eat nothing more than one poached egg since he had left\r\nthe alehouse where he had first met the guide returning from Sophia;\r\nfor with the gypsies he had feasted only his understanding.\r\n\r\nThe landlord so entirely agreed with the opinion of Mr Partridge, that\r\nhe no sooner heard the latter desire his friend to stay and dine, than\r\nhe very readily put in his word, and retracting his promise before\r\ngiven of furnishing the horses immediately, he assured Mr Jones he\r\nwould lose no time in bespeaking a dinner, which, he said, could be\r\ngot ready sooner than it was possible to get the horses up from grass,\r\nand to prepare them for their journey by a feed of corn.\r\n\r\nJones was at length prevailed on, chiefly by the latter argument of\r\nthe landlord; and now a joint of mutton was put down to the fire.\r\nWhile this was preparing, Partridge, being admitted into the same\r\napartment with his friend or master, began to harangue in the\r\nfollowing manner.\r\n\r\n“Certainly, sir, if ever man deserved a young lady, you deserve young\r\nMadam Western; for what a vast quantity of love must a man have, to be\r\nable to live upon it without any other food, as you do? I am positive\r\nI have eat thirty times as much within these last twenty-four hours as\r\nyour honour, and yet I am almost famished; for nothing makes a man so\r\nhungry as travelling, especially in this cold raw weather. And yet I\r\ncan't tell how it is, but your honour is seemingly in perfect good\r\nhealth, and you never looked better nor fresher in your life. It must\r\nbe certainly love that you live upon.”\r\n\r\n“And a very rich diet too, Partridge,” answered Jones. “But did not\r\nfortune send me an excellent dainty yesterday? Dost thou imagine I\r\ncannot live more than twenty-four hours on this dear pocket-book?”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly,” cries Partridge, “there is enough in that pocket-book\r\nto purchase many a good meal. Fortune sent it to your honour very\r\nopportunely for present use, as your honour's money must be almost out\r\nby this time.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” answered Jones; “I hope you don't imagine that I\r\nshould be dishonest enough, even if it belonged to any other person,\r\nbesides Miss Western----”\r\n\r\n“Dishonest!” replied Partridge, “heaven forbid I should wrong your\r\nhonour so much! but where's the dishonesty in borrowing a little for\r\npresent spending, since you will be so well able to pay the lady\r\nhereafter? No, indeed, I would have your honour pay it again, as soon\r\nas it is convenient, by all means; but where can be the harm in making\r\nuse of it now you want it? Indeed, if it belonged to a poor body, it\r\nwould be another thing; but so great a lady, to be sure, can never\r\nwant it, especially now as she is along with a lord, who, it can't be\r\ndoubted, will let her have whatever she hath need of. Besides, if she\r\nshould want a little, she can't want the whole, therefore I would give\r\nher a little; but I would be hanged before I mentioned the having\r\nfound it at first, and before I got some money of my own; for London,\r\nI have heard, is the very worst of places to be in without money.\r\nIndeed, if I had not known to whom it belonged, I might have thought\r\nit was the devil's money, and have been afraid to use it; but as you\r\nknow otherwise, and came honestly by it, it would be an affront to\r\nfortune to part with it all again, at the very time when you want it\r\nmost; you can hardly expect she should ever do you such another good\r\nturn; for _fortuna nunquam perpetuo est bona_. You will do as you\r\nplease, notwithstanding all I say; but for my part, I would be hanged\r\nbefore I mentioned a word of the matter.”\r\n\r\n“By what I can see, Partridge,” cries Jones, “hanging is a matter _non\r\nlonge alienum a Scaevolae studiis_.” “You should say _alienus_,” says\r\nPartridge,--“I remember the passage; it is an example under _communis,\r\nalienus, immunis, variis casibus serviunt_.” “If you do remember it,”\r\n cries Jones, “I find you don't understand it; but I tell thee, friend,\r\nin plain English, that he who finds another's property, and wilfully\r\ndetains it from the known owner, deserves, _in foro conscientiae_, to\r\nbe hanged, no less than if he had stolen it. And as for this very\r\nidentical bill, which is the property of my angel, and was once in her\r\ndear possession, I will not deliver it into any hands but her own,\r\nupon any consideration whatever, no, though I was as hungry as thou\r\nart, and had no other means to satisfy my craving appetite; this I\r\nhope to do before I sleep; but if it should happen otherwise, I charge\r\nthee, if thou would'st not incur my displeasure for ever, not to shock\r\nme any more by the bare mention of such detestable baseness.”\r\n\r\n“I should not have mentioned it now,” cries Partridge, “if it had\r\nappeared so to me; for I'm sure I scorn any wickedness as much as\r\nanother; but perhaps you know better; and yet I might have imagined\r\nthat I should not have lived so many years, and have taught school so\r\nlong, without being able to distinguish between _fas et nefas_; but it\r\nseems we are all to live and learn. I remember my old schoolmaster,\r\nwho was a prodigious great scholar, used often to say, _Polly matete\r\ncry town is my daskalon_. The English of which, he told us, was, That\r\na child may sometimes teach his grandmother to suck eggs. I have lived\r\nto a fine purpose, truly, if I am to be taught my grammar at this time\r\nof day. Perhaps, young gentleman, you may change your opinion, if you\r\nlive to my years: for I remember I thought myself as wise when I was a\r\nstripling of one or two and twenty as I am now. I am sure I always\r\ntaught _alienus_, and my master read it so before me.”\r\n\r\nThere were not many instances in which Partridge could provoke Jones,\r\nnor were there many in which Partridge himself could have been hurried\r\nout of his respect. Unluckily, however, they had both hit on one of\r\nthese. We have already seen Partridge could not bear to have his\r\nlearning attacked, nor could Jones bear some passage or other in the\r\nforegoing speech. And now, looking upon his companion with a\r\ncontemptuous and disdainful air (a thing not usual with him), he\r\ncried, “Partridge, I see thou art a conceited old fool, and I wish\r\nthou art not likewise an old rogue. Indeed, if I was as well convinced\r\nof the latter as I am of the former, thou should'st travel no farther\r\nin my company.”\r\n\r\nThe sage pedagogue was contented with the vent which he had already\r\ngiven to his indignation; and, as the vulgar phrase is, immediately\r\ndrew in his horns. He said, he was sorry he had uttered anything which\r\nmight give offence, for that he had never intended it; but _Nemo\r\nomnibus horis sapit_.\r\n\r\nAs Jones had the vices of a warm disposition, he was entirely free\r\nfrom those of a cold one; and if his friends must have confest his\r\ntemper to have been a little too easily ruffled, his enemies must at\r\nthe same time have confest, that it as soon subsided; nor did it at\r\nall resemble the sea, whose swelling is more violent and dangerous\r\nafter a storm is over than while the storm itself subsists. He\r\ninstantly accepted the submission of Partridge, shook him by the hand,\r\nand with the most benign aspect imaginable, said twenty kind things,\r\nand at the same time very severely condemned himself, though not half\r\nso severely as he will most probably be condemned by many of our good\r\nreaders.\r\n\r\nPartridge was now highly comforted, as his fears of having offended\r\nwere at once abolished, and his pride completely satisfied by Jones\r\nhaving owned himself in the wrong, which submission he instantly\r\napplied to what had principally nettled him, and repeated in a\r\nmuttering voice, “To be sure, sir, your knowledge may be superior to\r\nmine in some things; but as to the grammar, I think I may challenge\r\nany man living. I think, at least, I have that at my finger's end.”\r\n\r\nIf anything could add to the satisfaction which the poor man now\r\nenjoyed, he received this addition by the arrival of an excellent\r\nshoulder of mutton, that at this instant came smoaking to the table.\r\nOn which, having both plentifully feasted, they again mounted their\r\nhorses, and set forward for London."

      "title": "Chapter xiv.",
      "content": "What happened to Mr Jones in his journey from St Albans.\r\n\nThey were got about two miles beyond Barnet, and it was now the dusk\r\nof the evening, when a genteel-looking man, but upon a very shabby\r\nhorse, rode up to Jones, and asked him whether he was going to London;\r\nto which Jones answered in the affirmative. The gentleman replied, “I\r\nshould be obliged to you, sir, if you will accept of my company; for\r\nit is very late, and I am a stranger to the road.” Jones readily\r\ncomplied with the request; and on they travelled together, holding\r\nthat sort of discourse which is usual on such occasions.\r\n\r\nOf this, indeed, robbery was the principal topic: upon which subject\r\nthe stranger expressed great apprehensions; but Jones declared he had\r\nvery little to lose, and consequently as little to fear. Here\r\nPartridge could not forbear putting in his word. “Your honour,” said\r\nhe, “may think it a little, but I am sure, if I had a hundred-pound\r\nbank-note in my pocket, as you have, I should be very sorry to lose\r\nit; but, for my part, I never was less afraid in my life; for we are\r\nfour of us, and if we all stand by one another, the best man in\r\nEngland can't rob us. Suppose he should have a pistol, he can kill but\r\none of us, and a man can die but once.--That's my comfort, a man can\r\ndie but once.”\r\n\r\nBesides the reliance on superior numbers, a kind of valour which hath\r\nraised a certain nation among the moderns to a high pitch of glory,\r\nthere was another reason for the extraordinary courage which Partridge\r\nnow discovered; for he had at present as much of that quality as was\r\nin the power of liquor to bestow.\r\n\r\nOur company were now arrived within a mile of Highgate, when the\r\nstranger turned short upon Jones, and pulling out a pistol, demanded\r\nthat little bank-note which Partridge had mentioned.\r\n\r\nJones was at first somewhat shocked at this unexpected demand;\r\nhowever, he presently recollected himself, and told the highwayman,\r\nall the money he had in his pocket was entirely at his service; and so\r\nsaying, he pulled out upwards of three guineas, and offered to deliver\r\nit; but the other answered with an oath, That would not do. Jones\r\nanswered coolly, he was very sorry for it, and returned the money into\r\nhis pocket.\r\n\r\nThe highwayman then threatened, if he did not deliver the bank-note\r\nthat moment, he must shoot him; holding his pistol at the same time\r\nvery near to his breast. Jones instantly caught hold of the fellow's\r\nhand, which trembled so that he could scarce hold the pistol in it,\r\nand turned the muzzle from him. A struggle then ensued, in which the\r\nformer wrested the pistol from the hand of his antagonist, and both\r\ncame from their horses on the ground together, the highwayman upon his\r\nback, and the victorious Jones upon him.\r\n\r\nThe poor fellow now began to implore mercy of the conqueror: for, to\r\nsay the truth, he was in strength by no means a match for Jones.\r\n“Indeed, sir,” says he, “I could have had no intention to shoot you;\r\nfor you will find the pistol was not loaded. This is the first robbery\r\nI ever attempted, and I have been driven by distress to this.”\r\n\r\nAt this instant, at about a hundred and fifty yards' distance, lay\r\nanother person on the ground, roaring for mercy in a much louder voice\r\nthan the highwayman. This was no other than Partridge himself, who,\r\nendeavouring to make his escape from the engagement, had been thrown\r\nfrom his horse, and lay flat on his face, not daring to look up, and\r\nexpecting every minute to be shot.\r\n\r\nIn this posture he lay, till the guide, who was no otherwise concerned\r\nthan for his horses, having secured the stumbling beast, came up to\r\nhim, and told him his master had got the better of the highwayman.\r\n\r\nPartridge leapt up at this news, and ran back to the place where Jones\r\nstood with his sword drawn in his hand to guard the poor fellow; which\r\nPartridge no sooner saw than he cried out, “Kill the villain, sir, run\r\nhim through the body, kill him this instant!”\r\n\r\nLuckily, however, for the poor wretch, he had fallen into more\r\nmerciful hands; for Jones having examined the pistol, and found it to\r\nbe really unloaded, began to believe all the man had told him, before\r\nPartridge came up: namely, that he was a novice in the trade, and that\r\nhe had been driven to it by the distress he mentioned, the greatest\r\nindeed imaginable, that of five hungry children, and a wife lying in\r\nof the sixth, in the utmost want and misery. The truth of all which\r\nthe highwayman most vehemently asserted, and offered to convince Mr\r\nJones of it, if he would take the trouble to go to his house, which\r\nwas not above two miles off; saying, “That he desired no favour, but\r\nupon condition of proving all he had all alledged.”\r\n\r\nJones at first pretended that he would take the fellow at his word,\r\nand go with him, declaring that his fate should depend entirely on the\r\ntruth of his story. Upon this the poor fellow immediately expressed so\r\nmuch alacrity, that Jones was perfectly satisfied with his veracity,\r\nand began now to entertain sentiments of compassion for him. He\r\nreturned the fellow his empty pistol, advised him to think of honester\r\nmeans of relieving his distress, and gave him a couple of guineas for\r\nthe immediate support of his wife and his family; adding, “he wished\r\nhe had more for his sake, for the hundred pound that had been\r\nmentioned was not his own.”\r\n\r\nOur readers will probably be divided in their opinions concerning this\r\naction; some may applaud it perhaps as an act of extraordinary\r\nhumanity, while those of a more saturnine temper will consider it as a\r\nwant of regard to that justice which every man owes his country.\r\nPartridge certainly saw it in that light; for he testified much\r\ndissatisfaction on the occasion, quoted an old proverb, and said, he\r\nshould not wonder if the rogue attacked them again before they reached\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nThe highwayman was full of expressions of thankfulness and gratitude.\r\nHe actually dropt tears, or pretended so to do. He vowed he would\r\nimmediately return home, and would never afterwards commit such a\r\ntransgression: whether he kept his word or no, perhaps may appear\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nOur travellers having remounted their horses, arrived in town without\r\nencountering any new mishap. On the road much pleasant discourse\r\npassed between Jones and Partridge, on the subject of their last\r\nadventure: in which Jones exprest a great compassion for those\r\nhighwaymen who are, by unavoidable distress, driven, as it were, to\r\nsuch illegal courses, as generally bring them to a shameful death: “I\r\nmean,” said he, “those only whose highest guilt extends no farther\r\nthan to robbery, and who are never guilty of cruelty nor insult to any\r\nperson, which is a circumstance that, I must say, to the honour of our\r\ncountry, distinguishes the robbers of England from those of all other\r\nnations; for murder is, amongst those, almost inseparably incident to\r\nrobbery.”\r\n\r\n“No doubt,” answered Partridge, “it is better to take away one's money\r\nthan one's life; and yet it is very hard upon honest men, that they\r\ncan't travel about their business without being in danger of these\r\nvillains. And to be sure it would be better that all rogues were\r\nhanged out of the way, than that one honest man should suffer. For my\r\nown part, indeed, I should not care to have the blood of any of them\r\non my own hands; but it is very proper for the law to hang them all.\r\nWhat right hath any man to take sixpence from me, unless I give it\r\nhim? Is there any honesty in such a man?”\r\n\r\n“No, surely,” cries Jones, “no more than there is in him who takes the\r\nhorses out of another man's stable, or who applies to his own use the\r\nmoney which he finds, when he knows the right owner.”\r\n\r\nThese hints stopt the mouth of Partridge; nor did he open it again\r\ntill Jones, having thrown some sarcastical jokes on his cowardice, he\r\noffered to excuse himself on the inequality of fire-arms, saying, “A\r\nthousand naked men are nothing to one pistol; for though it is true it\r\nwill kill but one at a single discharge, yet who can tell but that one\r\nmay be himself?”\r\n\nBOOK XIII.\r\n\r\nCONTAINING THE SPACE OF TWELVE DAYS."

Thee, whom Maeonia educated, whom Mantua\r\ncharmed, and who, on that fair hill which overlooks the proud\r\nmetropolis of Britain, sat'st, with thy Milton, sweetly tuning the\r\nheroic lyre; fill my ravished fancy with the hopes of charming ages\r\nyet to come. Foretel me that some tender maid, whose grandmother is\r\nyet unborn, hereafter, when, under the fictitious name of Sophia, she\r\nreads the real worth which once existed in my Charlotte, shall from\r\nher sympathetic breast send forth the heaving sigh. Do thou teach me\r\nnot only to foresee, but to enjoy, nay, even to feed on future praise.\r\nComfort me by a solemn assurance, that when the little parlour in\r\nwhich I sit at this instant shall be reduced to a worse furnished box,\r\nI shall be read with honour by those who never knew nor saw me, and\r\nwhom I shall neither know nor see.\r\n\r\nAnd thou, much plumper dame, whom no airy forms nor phantoms of\r\nimagination cloathe; whom the well-seasoned beef, and pudding richly\r\nstained with plums, delight: thee I call: of whom in a treckschuyte,\r\nin some Dutch canal, the fat ufrow gelt, impregnated by a jolly\r\nmerchant of Amsterdam, was delivered: in Grub-street school didst thou\r\nsuck in the elements of thy erudition. Here hast thou, in thy maturer\r\nage, taught poetry to tickle not the fancy, but the pride of the\r\npatron. Comedy from thee learns a grave and solemn air; while tragedy\r\nstorms aloud, and rends th' affrighted theatres with its thunders. To\r\nsoothe thy wearied limbs in slumber, Alderman History tells his\r\ntedious tale; and, again, to awaken thee, Monsieur Romance performs\r\nhis surprizing tricks of dexterity. Nor less thy well-fed bookseller\r\nobeys thy influence. By thy advice the heavy, unread, folio lump,\r\nwhich long had dozed on the dusty shelf, piecemealed into numbers,\r\nruns nimbly through the nation. Instructed by thee, some books, like\r\nquacks, impose on the world by promising wonders; while others turn\r\nbeaus, and trust all their merits to a gilded outside. Come, thou\r\njolly substance, with thy shining face, keep back thy inspiration, but\r\nhold forth thy tempting rewards; thy shining, chinking heap; thy\r\nquickly convertible bank-bill, big with unseen riches; thy\r\noften-varying stock; the warm, the comfortable house; and, lastly, a\r\nfair portion of that bounteous mother, whose flowing breasts yield\r\nredundant sustenance for all her numerous offspring, did not some too\r\ngreedily and wantonly drive their brethren from the teat. Come thou,\r\nand if I am too tasteless of thy valuable treasures, warm my heart\r\nwith the transporting thought of conveying them to others. Tell me,\r\nthat through thy bounty, the pratling babes, whose innocent play hath\r\noften been interrupted by my labours, may one time be amply rewarded\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\nAnd now, this ill-yoked pair, this lean shadow and this fat substance,\r\nhave prompted me to write, whose assistance shall I invoke to direct\r\nmy pen?\r\n\r\nFirst, Genius; thou gift of Heaven; without whose aid in vain we\r\nstruggle against the stream of nature. Thou who dost sow the generous\r\nseeds which art nourishes, and brings to perfection. Do thou kindly\r\ntake me by the hand, and lead me through all the mazes, the winding\r\nlabyrinths of nature. Initiate me into all those mysteries which\r\nprofane eyes never beheld. Teach me, which to thee is no difficult\r\ntask, to know mankind better than they know themselves. Remove that\r\nmist which dims the intellects of mortals, and causes them to adore\r\nmen for their art, or to detest them for their cunning, in deceiving\r\nothers, when they are, in reality, the objects only of ridicule, for\r\ndeceiving themselves. Strip off the thin disguise of wisdom from\r\nself-conceit, of plenty from avarice, and of glory from ambition.\r\nCome, thou that hast inspired thy Aristophanes, thy Lucian, thy\r\nCervantes, thy Rabelais, thy Molière, thy Shakespear, thy Swift, thy\r\nMarivaux, fill my pages with humour; till mankind learn the\r\ngood-nature to laugh only at the follies of others, and the humility\r\nto grieve at their own.\r\n\r\nAnd thou, almost the constant attendant on true genius, Humanity,\r\nbring all thy tender sensations. If thou hast already disposed of them\r\nall between thy Allen and thy Lyttleton, steal them a little while\r\nfrom their bosoms. Not without these the tender scene is painted. From\r\nthese alone proceed the noble, disinterested friendship, the melting\r\nlove, the generous sentiment, the ardent gratitude, the soft\r\ncompassion, the candid opinion; and all those strong energies of a\r\ngood mind, which fill the moistened eyes with tears, the glowing\r\ncheeks with blood, and swell the heart with tides of grief, joy, and\r\nbenevolence.\r\n\r\nAnd thou, O Learning! (for without thy assistance nothing pure,\r\nnothing correct, can genius produce) do thou guide my pen. Thee in thy\r\nfavourite fields, where the limpid, gently-rolling Thames washes thy\r\nEtonian banks, in early youth I have worshipped. To thee, at thy\r\nbirchen altar, with true Spartan devotion, I have sacrificed my blood.\r\nCome then, and from thy vast, luxuriant stores, in long antiquity\r\npiled up, pour forth the rich profusion. Open thy Maeonian and thy\r\nMantuan coffers, with whatever else includes thy philosophic, thy\r\npoetic, and thy historical treasures, whether with Greek or Roman\r\ncharacters thou hast chosen to inscribe the ponderous chests: give me\r\na while that key to all thy treasures, which to thy Warburton thou\r\nhast entrusted.\r\n\r\nLastly, come Experience, long conversant with the wise, the good, the\r\nlearned, and the polite. Nor with them only, but with every kind of\r\ncharacter, from the minister at his levee, to the bailiff in his\r\nspunging-house; from the dutchess at her drum, to the landlady behind\r\nher bar. From thee only can the manners of mankind be known; to which\r\nthe recluse pedant, however great his parts or extensive his learning\r\nmay be, hath ever been a stranger.\r\n\r\nCome all these, and more, if possible; for arduous is the task I have\r\nundertaken; and, without all your assistance, will, I find, be too\r\nheavy for me to support. But if you all smile on my labours I hope\r\nstill to bring them to a happy conclusion."

      "content": "What befel Mr Jones on his arrival in London.\r\n\nThe learned Dr Misaubin used to say, that the proper direction to him\r\nwas _To Dr_ Misaubin, _in the World_; intimating that there were few\r\npeople in it to whom his great reputation was not known. And, perhaps,\r\nupon a very nice examination into the matter, we shall find that this\r\ncircumstance bears no inconsiderable part among the many blessings of\r\ngrandeur.\r\n\r\nThe great happiness of being known to posterity, with the hopes of\r\nwhich we so delighted ourselves in the preceding chapter, is the\r\nportion of few. To have the several elements which compose our names,\r\nas Sydenham expresses it, repeated a thousand years hence, is a gift\r\nbeyond the power of title and wealth; and is scarce to be purchased,\r\nunless by the sword and the pen. But to avoid the scandalous\r\nimputation, while we yet live, of being _one whom nobody knows_ (a\r\nscandal, by the bye, as old as the days of Homer[*]) will always be the\r\nenvied portion of those, who have a legal title either to honour or\r\nestate.\r\n\r\n [*] See the 2d Odyssey, ver. 175.\r\n\r\nFrom that figure, therefore, which the Irish peer, who brought Sophia\r\nto town, hath already made in this history, the reader will conclude,\r\ndoubtless, it must have been an easy matter to have discovered his\r\nhouse in London without knowing the particular street or square which\r\nhe inhabited, since he must have been one _whom everybody knows_. To\r\nsay the truth, so it would have been to any of those tradesmen who are\r\naccustomed to attend the regions of the great; for the doors of the\r\ngreat are generally no less easy to find than it is difficult to get\r\nentrance into them. But Jones, as well as Partridge, was an entire\r\nstranger in London; and as he happened to arrive first in a quarter of\r\nthe town, the inhabitants of which have very little intercourse with\r\nthe householders of Hanover or Grosvenor-square (for he entered\r\nthrough Gray's-inn-lane), so he rambled about some time before he\r\ncould even find his way to those happy mansions where fortune\r\nsegregates from the vulgar those magnanimous heroes, the descendants\r\nof antient Britons, Saxons, or Danes, whose ancestors, being born in\r\nbetter days, by sundry kinds of merit, have entailed riches and honour\r\non their posterity.\r\n\r\nJones, being at length arrived at those terrestrial Elysian fields,\r\nwould now soon have discovered his lordship's mansion; but the peer\r\nunluckily quitted his former house when he went for Ireland; and as he\r\nwas just entered into a new one, the fame of his equipage had not yet\r\nsufficiently blazed in the neighbourhood; so that, after a successless\r\nenquiry till the clock had struck eleven, Jones at last yielded to the\r\nadvice of Partridge, and retreated to the Bull and Gate in Holborn,\r\nthat being the inn where he had first alighted, and where he retired\r\nto enjoy that kind of repose which usually attends persons in his\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning he again set forth in pursuit of Sophia; and many\r\na weary step he took to no better purpose than before. At last,\r\nwhether it was that Fortune relented, or whether it was no longer in\r\nher power to disappoint him, he came into the very street which was\r\nhonoured by his lordship's residence; and, being directed to the\r\nhouse, he gave one gentle rap at the door.\r\n\r\nThe porter, who, from the modesty of the knock, had conceived no high\r\nidea of the person approaching, conceived but little better from the\r\nappearance of Mr Jones, who was drest in a suit of fustian, and had by\r\nhis side the weapon formerly purchased of the serjeant; of which,\r\nthough the blade might be composed of well-tempered steel, the handle\r\nwas composed only of brass, and that none of the brightest. When\r\nJones, therefore, enquired after the young lady who had come to town\r\nwith his lordship, this fellow answered surlily, “That there were no\r\nladies there.” Jones then desired to see the master of the house; but\r\nwas informed that his lordship would see nobody that morning. And upon\r\ngrowing more pressing the porter said, “he had positive orders to let\r\nno person in; but if you think proper,” said he, “to leave your name,\r\nI will acquaint his lordship; and if you call another time you shall\r\nknow when he will see you.”\r\n\r\nJones now declared, “that he had very particular business with the\r\nyoung lady, and could not depart without seeing her.” Upon which the\r\nporter, with no very agreeable voice or aspect, affirmed, “that there\r\nwas no young lady in that house, and consequently none could he see;”\r\n adding, “sure you are the strangest man I ever met with, for you will\r\nnot take an answer.”\r\n\r\nI have often thought that, by the particular description of Cerberus,\r\nthe porter of hell, in the 6th Aeneid, Virgil might possibly intend to\r\nsatirize the porters of the great men in his time; the picture, at\r\nleast, resembles those who have the honour to attend at the doors of\r\nour great men. The porter in his lodge answers exactly to Cerberus in\r\nhis den, and, like him, must be appeased by a sop before access can be\r\ngained to his master. Perhaps Jones might have seen him in that light,\r\nand have recollected the passage where the Sibyl, in order to procure\r\nan entrance for Aeneas, presents the keeper of the Stygian avenue with\r\nsuch a sop. Jones, in like manner, now began to offer a bribe to the\r\nhuman Cerberus, which a footman, overhearing, instantly advanced, and\r\ndeclared, “if Mr Jones would give him the sum proposed, he would\r\nconduct him to the lady.” Jones instantly agreed, and was forthwith\r\nconducted to the lodging of Mrs Fitzpatrick by the very fellow who had\r\nattended the ladies thither the day before.\r\n\r\nNothing more aggravates ill success than the near approach to good.\r\nThe gamester, who loses his party at piquet by a single point, laments\r\nhis bad luck ten times as much as he who never came within a prospect\r\nof the game. So in a lottery, the proprietors of the next numbers to\r\nthat which wins the great prize are apt to account themselves much\r\nmore unfortunate than their fellow-sufferers. In short, these kind of\r\nhairbreadth missings of happiness look like the insults of Fortune,\r\nwho may be considered as thus playing tricks with us, and wantonly\r\ndiverting herself at our expense.\r\n\r\nJones, who more than once already had experienced this frolicsome\r\ndisposition of the heathen goddess, was now again doomed to be\r\ntantalized in the like manner; for he arrived at the door of Mrs\r\nFitzpatrick about ten minutes after the departure of Sophia. He now\r\naddressed himself to the waiting-woman belonging to Mrs Fitzpatrick;\r\nwho told him the disagreeable news that the lady was gone, but could\r\nnot tell him whither; and the same answer he afterwards received from\r\nMrs Fitzpatrick herself. For as that lady made no doubt but that Mr\r\nJones was a person detached from her uncle Western, in pursuit of his\r\ndaughter, so she was too generous to betray her.\r\n\r\nThough Jones had never seen Mrs Fitzpatrick, yet he had heard that a\r\ncousin of Sophia was married to a gentleman of that name. This,\r\nhowever, in the present tumult of his mind, never once recurred to his\r\nmemory; but when the footman, who had conducted him from his\r\nlordship's, acquainted him with the great intimacy between the ladies,\r\nand with their calling each other cousin, he then recollected the\r\nstory of the marriage which he had formerly heard; and as he was\r\npresently convinced that this was the same woman, he became more\r\nsurprized at the answer which he had received, and very earnestly\r\ndesired leave to wait on the lady herself; but she as positively\r\nrefused him that honour.\r\n\r\nJones, who, though he had never seen a court, was better bred than\r\nmost who frequent it, was incapable of any rude or abrupt behaviour to\r\na lady. When he had received, therefore, a peremptory denial, he\r\nretired for the present, saying to the waiting-woman, “That if this\r\nwas an improper hour to wait on her lady, he would return in the\r\nafternoon; and that he then hoped to have the honour of seeing her.”\r\n The civility with which he uttered this, added to the great comeliness\r\nof his person, made an impression on the waiting-woman, and she could\r\nnot help answering; “Perhaps, sir, you may;” and, indeed, she\r\nafterwards said everything to her mistress, which she thought most\r\nlikely to prevail on her to admit a visit from the handsome young\r\ngentleman; for so she called him.\r\n\r\nJones very shrewdly suspected that Sophia herself was now with her\r\ncousin, and was denied to him; which he imputed to her resentment of\r\nwhat had happened at Upton. Having, therefore, dispatched Partridge to\r\nprocure him lodgings, he remained all day in the street, watching the\r\ndoor where he thought his angel lay concealed; but no person did he\r\nsee issue forth, except a servant of the house, and in the evening he\r\nreturned to pay his visit to Mrs Fitzpatrick, which that good lady at\r\nlast condescended to admit.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain air of natural gentility, which it is neither in\r\nthe power of dress to give, nor to conceal. Mr Jones, as hath been\r\nbefore hinted, was possessed of this in a very eminent degree. He met,\r\ntherefore, with a reception from the lady somewhat different from what\r\nhis apparel seemed to demand; and after he had paid her his proper\r\nrespects, was desired to sit down.\r\n\r\nThe reader will not, I believe, be desirous of knowing all the\r\nparticulars of this conversation, which ended very little to the\r\nsatisfaction of poor Jones. For though Mrs Fitzpatrick soon discovered\r\nthe lover (as all women have the eyes of hawks in those matters), yet\r\nshe still thought it was such a lover, as a generous friend of the\r\nlady should not betray her to. In short, she suspected this was the\r\nvery Mr Blifil, from whom Sophia had flown; and all the answers which\r\nshe artfully drew from Jones, concerning Mr Allworthy's family,\r\nconfirmed her in this opinion. She therefore strictly denied any\r\nknowledge concerning the place whither Sophia was gone; nor could\r\nJones obtain more than a permission to wait on her again the next\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nWhen Jones was departed Mrs Fitzpatrick communicated her suspicion\r\nconcerning Mr Blifil to her maid; who answered, “Sure, madam, he is\r\ntoo pretty a man, in my opinion, for any woman in the world to run\r\naway from. I had rather fancy it is Mr Jones.”--“Mr Jones!” said the\r\nlady, “what Jones?” For Sophia had not given the least hint of any\r\nsuch person in all their conversation; but Mrs Honour had been much\r\nmore communicative, and had acquainted her sister Abigail with the\r\nwhole history of Jones, which this now again related to her mistress.\r\n\r\nMrs Fitzpatrick no sooner received this information, than she\r\nimmediately agreed with the opinion of her maid; and, what is very\r\nunaccountable, saw charms in the gallant, happy lover, which she had\r\noverlooked in the slighted squire. “Betty,” says she, “you are\r\ncertainly in the right: he is a very pretty fellow, and I don't wonder\r\nthat my cousin's maid should tell you so many women are fond of him. I\r\nam sorry now I did not inform him where my cousin was; and yet, if he\r\nbe so terrible a rake as you tell me, it is a pity she should ever see\r\nhim any more; for what but her ruin can happen from marrying a rake\r\nand a beggar against her father's consent? I protest, if he be such a\r\nman as the wench described him to you, it is but an office of charity\r\nto keep her from him; and I am sure it would be unpardonable in me to\r\ndo otherwise, who have tasted so bitterly of the misfortunes attending\r\nsuch marriages.”\r\n\r\nHere she was interrupted by the arrival of a visitor, which was no\r\nother than his lordship; and as nothing passed at this visit either\r\nnew or extraordinary, or any ways material to this history, we shall\r\nhere put an end to this chapter."

      "content": "A project of Mrs Fitzpatrick, and her visit to Lady Bellaston.\r\n\nWhen Mrs Fitzpatrick retired to rest, her thoughts were entirely taken\r\nup by her cousin Sophia and Mr Jones. She was, indeed, a little\r\noffended with the former, for the disingenuity which she now\r\ndiscovered. In which meditation she had not long exercised her\r\nimagination before the following conceit suggested itself; that could\r\nshe possibly become the means of preserving Sophia from this man, and\r\nof restoring her to her father, she should, in all human probability,\r\nby so great a service to the family, reconcile to herself both her\r\nuncle and her aunt Western.\r\n\r\nAs this was one of her most favourite wishes, so the hope of success\r\nseemed so reasonable, that nothing remained but to consider of proper\r\nmethods to accomplish her scheme. To attempt to reason the case with\r\nSophia did not appear to her one of those methods: for as Betty had\r\nreported from Mrs Honour, that Sophia had a violent inclination to\r\nJones, she conceived that to dissuade her from the match was an\r\nendeavour of the same kind, as it would be very heartily and earnestly\r\nto entreat a moth not to fly into a candle.\r\n\r\nIf the reader will please to remember that the acquaintance which\r\nSophia had with Lady Bellaston was contracted at the house of Mrs\r\nWestern, and must have grown at the very time when Mrs Fitzpatrick\r\nlived with this latter lady, he will want no information, that Mrs\r\nFitzpatrick must have been acquainted with her likewise. They were,\r\nbesides, both equally her distant relations.\r\n\r\nAfter much consideration, therefore, she resolved to go early in the\r\nmorning to that lady, and endeavour to see her, unknown to Sophia, and\r\nto acquaint her with the whole affair. For she did not in the least\r\ndoubt, but that the prudent lady, who had often ridiculed romantic\r\nlove, and indiscreet marriages, in her conversation, would very\r\nreadily concur in her sentiments concerning this match, and would lend\r\nher utmost assistance to prevent it.\r\n\r\nThis resolution she accordingly executed; and the next morning before\r\nthe sun, she huddled on her cloaths, and at a very unfashionable,\r\nunseasonable, unvisitable hour, went to Lady Bellaston, to whom she\r\ngot access, without the least knowledge or suspicion of Sophia, who,\r\nthough not asleep, lay at that time awake in her bed, with Honour\r\nsnoring by her side.\r\n\r\nMrs Fitzpatrick made many apologies for an early, abrupt visit, at an\r\nhour when, she said, “she should not have thought of disturbing her\r\nladyship, but upon business of the utmost consequence.” She then\r\nopened the whole affair, told all she had heard from Betty; and did\r\nnot forget the visit which Jones had paid to herself the preceding\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nLady Bellaston answered with a smile, “Then you have seen this\r\nterrible man, madam; pray, is he so very fine a figure as he is\r\nrepresented? for Etoff entertained me last night almost two hours with\r\nhim. The wench I believe is in love with him by reputation.” Here the\r\nreader will be apt to wonder; but the truth is, that Mrs Etoff, who\r\nhad the honour to pin and unpin the Lady Bellaston, had received\r\ncompleat information concerning the said Mr Jones, and had faithfully\r\nconveyed the same to her lady last night (or rather that morning)\r\nwhile she was undressing; on which accounts she had been detained in\r\nher office above the space of an hour and a half.\r\n\r\nThe lady indeed, though generally well enough pleased with the\r\nnarratives of Mrs Etoff at those seasons, gave an extraordinary\r\nattention to her account of Jones; for Honour had described him as a\r\nvery handsome fellow, and Mrs Etoff, in her hurry, added so much to\r\nthe beauty of his person to her report, that Lady Bellaston began to\r\nconceive him to be a kind of miracle in nature.\r\n\r\nThe curiosity which her woman had inspired was now greatly increased\r\nby Mrs Fitzpatrick, who spoke as much in favour of the person of Jones\r\nas she had before spoken in dispraise of his birth, character, and\r\nfortune.\r\n\r\nWhen Lady Bellaston had heard the whole, she answered gravely,\r\n“Indeed, madam, this is a matter of great consequence. Nothing can\r\ncertainly be more commendable than the part you act; and I shall be\r\nvery glad to have my share in the preservation of a young lady of so\r\nmuch merit, and for whom I have so much esteem.”\r\n\r\n“Doth not your ladyship think,” says Mrs Fitzpatrick eagerly, “that it\r\nwould be the best way to write immediately to my uncle, and acquaint\r\nhim where my cousin is?”\r\n\r\nThe lady pondered a little upon this, and thus answered--“Why, no,\r\nmadam, I think not. Di Western hath described her brother to me to be\r\nsuch a brute, that I cannot consent to put any woman under his power\r\nwho hath escaped from it. I have heard he behaved like a monster to\r\nhis own wife, for he is one of those wretches who think they have a\r\nright to tyrannise over us, and from such I shall ever esteem it the\r\ncause of my sex to rescue any woman who is so unfortunate to be under\r\ntheir power.--The business, dear cousin, will be only to keep Miss\r\nWestern from seeing this young fellow, till the good company, which\r\nshe will have an opportunity of meeting here, give her a properer\r\nturn.”\r\n\r\n“If he should find her out, madam,” answered the other, “your ladyship\r\nmay be assured he will leave nothing unattempted to come at her.”\r\n\r\n“But, madam,” replied the lady, “it is impossible he should come\r\nhere--though indeed it is possible he may get some intelligence where\r\nshe is, and then may lurk about the house--I wish therefore I knew his\r\nperson.\r\n\r\n“Is there no way, madam, by which I could have a sight of him? for,\r\notherwise, you know, cousin, she may contrive to see him here without\r\nmy knowledge.” Mrs Fitzpatrick answered, “That he had threatened her\r\nwith another visit that afternoon, and that, if her ladyship pleased\r\nto do her the honour of calling upon her then, she would hardly fail\r\nof seeing him between six and seven; and if he came earlier she would,\r\nby some means or other, detain him till her ladyship's arrival.”--Lady\r\nBellaston replied, “She would come the moment she could get from\r\ndinner, which she supposed would be by seven at farthest; for that it\r\nwas absolutely necessary she should be acquainted with his person.\r\nUpon my word, madam,” says she, “it was very good to take this care of\r\nMiss Western; but common humanity, as well as regard to our family,\r\nrequires it of us both; for it would be a dreadful match indeed.”\r\n\r\nMrs Fitzpatrick failed not to make a proper return to the compliment\r\nwhich Lady Bellaston had bestowed on her cousin, and, after some\r\nlittle immaterial conversation, withdrew; and, getting as fast as she\r\ncould into her chair, unseen by Sophia or Honour, returned home."

      "content": "Which consists of visiting.\r\n\nMr Jones had walked within sight of a certain door during the whole\r\nday, which, though one of the shortest, appeared to him to be one of\r\nthe longest in the whole year. At length, the clock having struck\r\nfive, he returned to Mrs Fitzpatrick, who, though it was a full hour\r\nearlier than the decent time of visiting, received him very civilly;\r\nbut still persisted in her ignorance concerning Sophia.\r\n\r\nJones, in asking for his angel, had dropped the word cousin, upon\r\nwhich Mrs Fitzpatrick said, “Then, sir, you know we are related: and,\r\nas we are, you will permit me the right of enquiring into the\r\nparticulars of your business with my cousin.” Here Jones hesitated a\r\ngood while, and at last answered, “He had a considerable sum of money\r\nof hers in his hands, which he desired to deliver to her.” He then\r\nproduced the pocket-book, and acquainted Mrs Fitzpatrick with the\r\ncontents, and with the method in which they came into his hands. He\r\nhad scarce finished his story, when a most violent noise shook the\r\nwhole house. To attempt to describe this noise to those who have heard\r\nit would be in vain; and to aim at giving any idea of it to those who\r\nhave never heard the like, would be still more vain: for it may be\r\ntruly said--\r\n\r\n _--Non acuta\r\n Sic geminant Corybantes aera._\r\n\r\n The priests of Cybele do not so rattle their sounding brass.\r\n\r\nIn short, a footman knocked, or rather thundered, at the door. Jones\r\nwas a little surprized at the sound, having never heard it before; but\r\nMrs Fitzpatrick very calmly said, that, as some company were coming,\r\nshe could not make him any answer now; but if he pleased to stay till\r\nthey were gone, she intimated she had something to say to him.\r\n\r\nThe door of the room now flew open, and, after pushing in her hoop\r\nsideways before her, entered Lady Bellaston, who having first made a\r\nvery low courtesy to Mrs Fitzpatrick, and as low a one to Mr Jones,\r\nwas ushered to the upper end of the room.\r\n\r\nWe mention these minute matters for the sake of some country ladies of\r\nour acquaintance, who think it contrary to the rules of modesty to\r\nbend their knees to a man.\r\n\r\nThe company were hardly well settled, before the arrival of the peer\r\nlately mentioned, caused a fresh disturbance, and a repetition of\r\nceremonials.\r\n\r\nThese being over, the conversation began to be (as the phrase is)\r\nextremely brilliant. However, as nothing past in it which can be\r\nthought material to this history, or, indeed, very material in itself,\r\nI shall omit the relation; the rather, as I have known some very fine\r\npolite conversation grow extremely dull, when transcribed into books,\r\nor repeated on the stage. Indeed, this mental repast is a dainty, of\r\nwhich those who are excluded from polite assemblies must be contented\r\nto remain as ignorant as they must of the several dainties of French\r\ncookery, which are served only at the tables of the great. To say the\r\ntruth, as neither of these are adapted to every taste, they might both\r\nbe often thrown away on the vulgar.\r\n\r\nPoor Jones was rather a spectator of this elegant scene, than an actor\r\nin it; for though, in the short interval before the peer's arrival,\r\nLady Bellaston first, and afterwards Mrs Fitzpatrick, had addressed\r\nsome of their discourse to him; yet no sooner was the noble lord\r\nentered, than he engrossed the whole attention of the two ladies to\r\nhimself; and as he took no more notice of Jones than if no such person\r\nhad been present, unless by now and then staring at him, the ladies\r\nfollowed his example.\r\n\r\nThe company had now staid so long, that Mrs Fitzpatrick plainly\r\nperceived they all designed to stay out each other. She therefore\r\nresolved to rid herself of Jones, he being the visitant to whom she\r\nthought the least ceremony was due. Taking therefore an opportunity of\r\na cessation of chat, she addressed herself gravely to him, and said,\r\n“Sir, I shall not possibly be able to give you an answer to-night as\r\nto that business; but if you please to leave word where I may send to\r\nyou to-morrow---”\r\n\r\nJones had natural, but not artificial good-breeding. Instead therefore\r\nof communicating the secret of his lodgings to a servant, he\r\nacquainted the lady herself with it particularly, and soon after very\r\nceremoniously withdrew.\r\n\r\nHe was no sooner gone than the great personages, who had taken no\r\nnotice of him present, began to take much notice of him in his\r\nabsence; but if the reader hath already excused us from relating the\r\nmore brilliant part of this conversation, he will surely be very ready\r\nto excuse the repetition of what may be called vulgar abuse; though,\r\nperhaps, it may be material to our history to mention an observation\r\nof Lady Bellaston, who took her leave in a few minutes after him, and\r\nthen said to Mrs Fitzpatrick, at her departure, “I am satisfied on the\r\naccount of my cousin; she can be in no danger from this fellow.”\r\n\r\nOur history shall follow the example of Lady Bellaston, and take leave\r\nof the present company, which was now reduced to two persons; between\r\nwhom, as nothing passed, which in the least concerns us or our reader,\r\nwe shall not suffer ourselves to be diverted by it from matters which\r\nmust seem of more consequence to all those who are at all interested\r\nin the affairs of our heroe."

      "content": "An adventure which happened to Mr Jones at his lodgings, with some\r\naccount of a young gentleman who lodged there, and of the mistress of\r\nthe house, and her two daughters.\r\n\nThe next morning, as early as it was decent, Jones attended at Mrs\r\nFitzpatrick's door, where he was answered that the lady was not at\r\nhome; an answer which surprized him the more, as he had walked\r\nbackwards and forwards in the street from break of day; and if she had\r\ngone out, he must have seen her. This answer, however, he was obliged\r\nto receive, and not only now, but to five several visits which he made\r\nher that day.\r\n\r\nTo be plain with the reader, the noble peer had from some reason or\r\nother, perhaps from a regard for the lady's honour, insisted that she\r\nshould not see Mr Jones, whom he looked on as a scrub, any more; and\r\nthe lady had complied in making that promise to which we now see her\r\nso strictly adhere.\r\n\r\nBut as our gentle reader may possibly have a better opinion of the\r\nyoung gentleman than her ladyship, and may even have some concern,\r\nshould it be apprehended that, during this unhappy separation from\r\nSophia, he took up his residence either at an inn, or in the street;\r\nwe shall now give an account of his lodging, which was indeed in a\r\nvery reputable house, and in a very good part of the town.\r\n\r\nMr Jones, then, had often heard Mr Allworthy mention the gentlewoman\r\nat whose house he used to lodge when he was in town. This person, who,\r\nas Jones likewise knew, lived in Bond-street, was the widow of a\r\nclergyman, and was left by him, at his decease, in possession of two\r\ndaughters, and of a compleat set of manuscript sermons.\r\n\r\nOf these two daughters, Nancy, the elder, was now arrived at the age\r\nof seventeen, and Betty, the younger, at that of ten.\r\n\r\nHither Jones had despatched Partridge, and in this house he was\r\nprovided with a room for himself in the second floor, and with one for\r\nPartridge in the fourth.\r\n\r\nThe first floor was inhabited by one of those young gentlemen, who, in\r\nthe last age, were called men of wit and pleasure about town, and\r\nproperly enough; for as men are usually denominated from their\r\nbusiness or profession, so pleasure may be said to have been the only\r\nbusiness or profession of those gentlemen to whom fortune had made all\r\nuseful occupations unnecessary. Playhouses, coffeehouses, and taverns\r\nwere the scenes of their rendezvous. Wit and humour were the\r\nentertainment of their looser hours, and love was the business of\r\ntheir more serious moments. Wine and the muses conspired to kindle the\r\nbrightest flames in their breasts; nor did they only admire, but some\r\nwere able to celebrate the beauty they admired, and all to judge of\r\nthe merit of such compositions.\r\n\r\nSuch, therefore, were properly called the men of wit and pleasure; but\r\nI question whether the same appellation may, with the same propriety,\r\nbe given to those young gentlemen of our times, who have the same\r\nambition to be distinguished for parts. Wit certainly they have\r\nnothing to do with. To give them their due, they soar a step higher\r\nthan their predecessors, and may be called men of wisdom and vertù\r\n(take heed you do not read virtue). Thus at an age when the gentlemen\r\nabove mentioned employ their time in toasting the charms of a woman,\r\nor in making sonnets in her praise; in giving their opinion of a play\r\nat the theatre, or of a poem at Will's or Button's; these gentlemen\r\nare considering the methods to bribe a corporation, or meditating\r\nspeeches for the House of Commons, or rather for the magazines. But\r\nthe science of gaming is that which above all others employs their\r\nthoughts. These are the studies of their graver hours, while for their\r\namusements they have the vast circle of connoisseurship, painting,\r\nmusic, statuary, and natural philosophy, or rather _unnatural_, which\r\ndeals in the wonderful, and knows nothing of Nature, except her\r\nmonsters and imperfections.\r\n\r\nWhen Jones had spent the whole day in vain enquiries after Mrs\r\nFitzpatrick, he returned at last disconsolate to his apartment. Here,\r\nwhile he was venting his grief in private, he heard a violent uproar\r\nbelow-stairs; and soon after a female voice begged him for heaven's\r\nsake to come and prevent murder. Jones, who was never backward on any\r\noccasion to help the distressed, immediately ran down-stairs; when\r\nstepping into the dining-room, whence all the noise issued, he beheld\r\nthe young gentleman of wisdom and vertù just before mentioned, pinned\r\nclose to the wall by his footman, and a young woman standing by,\r\nwringing her hands, and crying out, “He will be murdered! he will be\r\nmurdered!” and, indeed, the poor gentleman seemed in some danger of\r\nbeing choaked, when Jones flew hastily to his assistance, and rescued\r\nhim, just as he was breathing his last, from the unmerciful clutches\r\nof the enemy.\r\n\r\nThough the fellow had received several kicks and cuffs from the little\r\ngentleman, who had more spirit than strength, he had made it a kind of\r\nscruple of conscience to strike his master, and would have contented\r\nhimself with only choaking him; but towards Jones he bore no such\r\nrespect; he no sooner therefore found himself a little roughly handled\r\nby his new antagonist, than he gave him one of those punches in the\r\nguts which, though the spectators at Broughton's amphitheatre have\r\nsuch exquisite delight in seeing them, convey but very little pleasure\r\nin the feeling.\r\n\r\nThe lusty youth had no sooner received this blow, than he meditated a\r\nmost grateful return; and now ensued a combat between Jones and the\r\nfootman, which was very fierce, but short; for this fellow was no more\r\nable to contend with Jones than his master had before been to contend\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Fortune, according to her usual custom, reversed the face of\r\naffairs. The former victor lay breathless on the ground, and the\r\nvanquished gentleman had recovered breath enough to thank Mr Jones for\r\nhis seasonable assistance; he received likewise the hearty thanks of\r\nthe young woman present, who was indeed no other than Miss Nancy, the\r\neldest daughter of the house.\r\n\r\nThe footman, having now recovered his legs, shook his head at Jones,\r\nand, with a sagacious look, cried--“O d--n me, I'll have nothing more\r\nto do with you; you have been upon the stage, or I'm d--nably\r\nmistaken.” And indeed we may forgive this his suspicion; for such was\r\nthe agility and strength of our heroe, that he was, perhaps, a match\r\nfor one of the first-rate boxers, and could, with great ease, have\r\nbeaten all the muffled[*] graduates of Mr Broughton's school.\r\n\r\n [*] Lest posterity should be puzzled by this epithet, I think proper\r\n to explain it by an advertisement which was published Feb. 1, 1747.\r\n\r\n N.B.--Mr Broughton proposes, with proper assistance, to open an\r\n academy at his house in the Haymarket, for the instruction of those\r\n who are willing to be initiated in the mystery of boxing: where the\r\n whole theory and practice of that truly British art, with all the\r\n various stops, blows, cross-buttocks, &c., incident to combatants,\r\n will be fully taught and explained; and that persons of quality and\r\n distinction may not be deterred from entering into _A course of\r\n those lectures_, they will be given with the utmost tenderness and\r\n regard to the delicacy of the frame and constitution of the pupil,\r\n for which reason muffles are provided, that will effectually secure\r\n them from the inconveniency of black eyes, broken jaws, and bloody\r\n noses.\r\n\r\nThe master, foaming with wrath, ordered his man immediately to strip,\r\nto which the latter very readily agreed, on condition of receiving his\r\nwages. This condition was presently complied with, and the fellow was\r\ndischarged.\r\n\r\nAnd now the young gentleman, whose name was Nightingale, very\r\nstrenuously insisted that his deliverer should take part of a bottle\r\nof wine with him; to which Jones, after much entreaty, consented,\r\nthough more out of complacence than inclination; for the uneasiness of\r\nhis mind fitted him very little for conversation at this time. Miss\r\nNancy likewise, who was the only female then in the house, her mamma\r\nand sister being both gone to the play, condescended to favour them\r\nwith her company.\r\n\r\nWhen the bottle and glasses were on the table the gentleman began to\r\nrelate the occasion of the preceding disturbance.\r\n\r\n“I hope, sir,” said he to Jones, “you will not from this accident\r\nconclude, that I make a custom of striking my servants, for I assure\r\nyou this is the first time I have been guilty of it in my remembrance,\r\nand I have passed by many provoking faults in this very fellow, before\r\nhe could provoke me to it; but when you hear what hath happened this\r\nevening, you will, I believe, think me excusable. I happened to come\r\nhome several hours before my usual time, when I found four gentlemen\r\nof the cloth at whist by my fire;--and my Hoyle, sir--my best Hoyle,\r\nwhich cost me a guinea, lying open on the table, with a quantity of\r\nporter spilt on one of the most material leaves of the whole book.\r\nThis, you will allow, was provoking; but I said nothing till the rest\r\nof the honest company were gone, and then gave the fellow a gentle\r\nrebuke, who, instead of expressing any concern, made me a pert answer,\r\n`That servants must have their diversions as well as other people;\r\nthat he was sorry for the accident which had happened to the book, but\r\nthat several of his acquaintance had bought the same for a shilling,\r\nand that I might stop as much in his wages, if I pleased.' I now gave\r\nhim a severer reprimand than before, when the rascal had the insolence\r\nto---In short, he imputed my early coming home to----In short, he cast\r\na reflection----He mentioned the name of a young lady, in a manner--in\r\nsuch a manner that incensed me beyond all patience, and, in my\r\npassion, I struck him.”\r\n\r\nJones answered, “That he believed no person living would blame him;\r\nfor my part,” said he, “I confess I should, on the last-mentioned\r\nprovocation, have done the same thing.”\r\n\r\nOur company had not sat long before they were joined by the mother and\r\ndaughter, at their return from the play. And now they all spent a very\r\nchearful evening together; for all but Jones were heartily merry, and\r\neven he put on as much constrained mirth as possible. Indeed, half his\r\nnatural flow of animal spirits, joined to the sweetness of his temper,\r\nwas sufficient to make a most amiable companion; and notwithstanding\r\nthe heaviness of his heart, so agreeable did he make himself on the\r\npresent occasion, that, at their breaking up, the young gentleman\r\nearnestly desired his further acquaintance. Miss Nancy was well\r\npleased with him; and the widow, quite charmed with her new lodger,\r\ninvited him, with the other, next morning to breakfast.\r\n\r\nJones on his part was no less satisfied. As for Miss Nancy, though a\r\nvery little creature, she was extremely pretty, and the widow had all\r\nthe charms which can adorn a woman near fifty. As she was one of the\r\nmost innocent creatures in the world, so she was one of the most\r\nchearful. She never thought, nor spoke, nor wished any ill, and had\r\nconstantly that desire of pleasing, which may be called the happiest\r\nof all desires in this, that it scarce ever fails of attaining its\r\nends, when not disgraced by affectation. In short, though her power\r\nwas very small, she was in her heart one of the warmest friends. She\r\nhad been a most affectionate wife, and was a most fond and tender\r\nmother. As our history doth not, like a newspaper, give great\r\ncharacters to people who never were heard of before, nor will ever be\r\nheard of again, the reader may hence conclude, that this excellent\r\nwoman will hereafter appear to be of some importance in our history.\r\n\r\nNor was Jones a little pleased with the young gentleman himself, whose\r\nwine he had been drinking. He thought he discerned in him much good\r\nsense, though a little too much tainted with town-foppery; but what\r\nrecommended him most to Jones were some sentiments of great generosity\r\nand humanity, which occasionally dropt from him; and particularly many\r\nexpressions of the highest disinterestedness in the affair of love. On\r\nwhich subject the young gentleman delivered himself in a language\r\nwhich might have very well become an Arcadian shepherd of old, and\r\nwhich appeared very extraordinary when proceeding from the lips of a\r\nmodern fine gentleman; but he was only one by imitation, and meant by\r\nnature for a much better character."

      "content": "What arrived while the company were at breakfast, with some hints\r\nconcerning the government of daughters.\r\n\nOur company brought together in the morning the same good inclinations\r\ntowards each other, with which they had separated the evening before;\r\nbut poor Jones was extremely disconsolate; for he had just received\r\ninformation from Partridge, that Mrs Fitzpatrick had left her lodging,\r\nand that he could not learn whither she was gone. This news highly\r\nafflicted him, and his countenance, as well as his behaviour, in\r\ndefiance of all his endeavours to the contrary, betrayed manifest\r\nindications of a disordered mind.\r\n\r\nThe discourse turned at present, as before, on love; and Mr\r\nNightingale again expressed many of those warm, generous, and\r\ndisinterested sentiments upon this subject, which wise and sober men\r\ncall romantic, but which wise and sober women generally regard in a\r\nbetter light. Mrs Miller (for so the mistress of the house was called)\r\ngreatly approved these sentiments; but when the young gentleman\r\nappealed to Miss Nancy, she answered only, “That she believed the\r\ngentleman who had spoke the least was capable of feeling most.”\r\n\r\nThis compliment was so apparently directed to Jones, that we should\r\nhave been sorry had he passed it by unregarded. He made her indeed a\r\nvery polite answer, and concluded with an oblique hint, that her own\r\nsilence subjected her to a suspicion of the same kind: for indeed she\r\nhad scarce opened her lips either now or the last evening.\r\n\r\n“I am glad, Nanny,” says Mrs Miller, “the gentleman hath made the\r\nobservation; I protest I am almost of his opinion. What can be the\r\nmatter with you, child? I never saw such an alteration. What is become\r\nof all your gaiety? Would you think, sir, I used to call her my little\r\nprattler? She hath not spoke twenty words this week.”\r\n\r\nHere their conversation was interrupted by the entrance of a\r\nmaid-servant, who brought a bundle in her hand, which, she said, “was\r\ndelivered by a porter for Mr Jones.” She added, “That the man\r\nimmediately went away, saying, it required no answer.”\r\n\r\nJones expressed some surprize on this occasion, and declared it must\r\nbe some mistake; but the maid persisting that she was certain of the\r\nname, all the women were desirous of having the bundle immediately\r\nopened; which operation was at length performed by little Betsy, with\r\nthe consent of Mr Jones: and the contents were found to be a domino, a\r\nmask, and a masquerade ticket.\r\n\r\nJones was now more positive than ever in asserting, that these things\r\nmust have been delivered by mistake; and Mrs Miller herself expressed\r\nsome doubt, and said, “She knew not what to think.” But when Mr\r\nNightingale was asked, he delivered a very different opinion. “All I\r\ncan conclude from it, sir,” said he, “is, that you are a very happy\r\nman; for I make no doubt but these were sent you by some lady whom you\r\nwill have the happiness of meeting at the masquerade.”\r\n\r\nJones had not a sufficient degree of vanity to entertain any such\r\nflattering imagination; nor did Mrs Miller herself give much assent to\r\nwhat Mr Nightingale had said, till Miss Nancy having lifted up the\r\ndomino, a card dropt from the sleeve, in which was written as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n To MR JONES.\r\n\r\n The queen of the fairies sends you this;\r\n Use her favours not amiss.\r\n\r\nMrs Miller and Miss Nancy now both agreed with Mr Nightingale; nay,\r\nJones himself was almost persuaded to be of the same opinion. And as\r\nno other lady but Mrs Fitzpatrick, he thought, knew his lodging, he\r\nbegan to flatter himself with some hopes, that it came from her, and\r\nthat he might possibly see his Sophia. These hopes had surely very\r\nlittle foundation; but as the conduct of Mrs Fitzpatrick, in not\r\nseeing him according to her promise, and in quitting her lodgings, had\r\nbeen very odd and unaccountable, he conceived some faint hopes, that\r\nshe (of whom he had formerly heard a very whimsical character) might\r\npossibly intend to do him that service in a strange manner, which she\r\ndeclined doing by more ordinary methods. To say the truth, as nothing\r\ncertain could be concluded from so odd and uncommon an incident, he\r\nhad the greater latitude to draw what imaginary conclusions from it he\r\npleased. As his temper therefore was naturally sanguine, he indulged\r\nit on this occasion, and his imagination worked up a thousand\r\nconceits, to favour and support his expectations of meeting his dear\r\nSophia in the evening.\r\n\r\nReader, if thou hast any good wishes towards me, I will fully repay\r\nthem by wishing thee to be possessed of this sanguine disposition of\r\nmind; since, after having read much and considered long on that\r\nsubject of happiness which hath employed so many great pens, I am\r\nalmost inclined to fix it in the possession of this temper; which puts\r\nus, in a manner, out of the reach of Fortune, and makes us happy\r\nwithout her assistance. Indeed, the sensations of pleasure it gives\r\nare much more constant as well as much keener, than those which that\r\nblind lady bestows; nature having wisely contrived, that some satiety\r\nand languor should be annexed to all our real enjoyments, lest we\r\nshould be so taken up by them, as to be stopt from further pursuits. I\r\nmake no manner of doubt but that, in this light, we may see the\r\nimaginary future chancellor just called to the bar, the archbishop in\r\ncrape, and the prime minister at the tail of an opposition, more truly\r\nhappy than those who are invested with all the power and profit of\r\nthose respective offices.\r\n\r\nMr Jones having now determined to go to the masquerade that evening,\r\nMr Nightingale offered to conduct him thither. The young gentleman, at\r\nthe same time, offered tickets to Miss Nancy and her mother; but the\r\ngood woman would not accept them. She said, “she did not conceive the\r\nharm which some people imagined in a masquerade; but that such\r\nextravagant diversions were proper only for persons of quality and\r\nfortune, and not for young women who were to get their living, and\r\ncould, at best, hope to be married to a good tradesman.”----“A\r\ntradesman!” cries Nightingale, “you shan't undervalue my Nancy. There\r\nis not a nobleman upon earth above her merit.” “O fie! Mr\r\nNightingale,” answered Mrs Miller, “you must not fill the girl's head\r\nwith such fancies: but if it was her good luck” (says the mother with\r\na simper) “to find a gentleman of your generous way of thinking, I\r\nhope she would make a better return to his generosity than to give her\r\nmind up to extravagant pleasures. Indeed, where young ladies bring\r\ngreat fortunes themselves, they have some right to insist on spending\r\nwhat is their own; and on that account I have heard the gentlemen say,\r\na man has sometimes a better bargain with a poor wife, than with a\r\nrich one.----But let my daughters marry whom they will, I shall\r\nendeavour to make them blessings to their husbands:----I beg,\r\ntherefore, I may hear of no more masquerades. Nancy is, I am certain,\r\ntoo good a girl to desire to go; for she must remember when you\r\ncarried her thither last year, it almost turned her head; and she did\r\nnot return to herself, or to her needle, in a month afterwards.”\r\n\r\nThough a gentle sigh, which stole from the bosom of Nancy, seemed to\r\nargue some secret disapprobation of these sentiments, she did not dare\r\nopenly to oppose them. For as this good woman had all the tenderness,\r\nso she had preserved all the authority of a parent; and as her\r\nindulgence to the desires of her children was restrained only by her\r\nfears for their safety and future welfare, so she never suffered those\r\ncommands which proceeded from such fears to be either disobeyed or\r\ndisputed. And this the young gentleman, who had lodged two years in\r\nthe house, knew so well, that he presently acquiesced in the refusal.\r\n\r\nMr Nightingale, who grew every minute fonder of Jones, was very\r\ndesirous of his company that day to dinner at the tavern, where he\r\noffered to introduce him to some of his acquaintance; but Jones begged\r\nto be excused, “as his cloaths,” he said, “were not yet come to town.”\r\n\r\nTo confess the truth, Mr Jones was now in a situation, which sometimes\r\nhappens to be the case of young gentlemen of much better figure than\r\nhimself. In short, he had not one penny in his pocket; a situation in\r\nmuch greater credit among the antient philosophers than among the\r\nmodern wise men who live in Lombard-street, or those who frequent\r\nWhite's chocolate-house. And, perhaps, the great honours which those\r\nphilosophers have ascribed to an empty pocket may be one of the\r\nreasons of that high contempt in which they are held in the aforesaid\r\nstreet and chocolate-house.\r\n\r\nNow if the antient opinion, that men might live very comfortably on\r\nvirtue only, be, as the modern wise men just above-mentioned pretend\r\nto have discovered, a notorious error; no less false is, I apprehend,\r\nthat position of some writers of romance, that a man can live\r\naltogether on love; for however delicious repasts this may afford to\r\nsome of our senses or appetites, it is most certain it can afford none\r\nto others. Those, therefore, who have placed too great a confidence in\r\nsuch writers, have experienced their error when it was too late; and\r\nhave found that love was no more capable of allaying hunger, than a\r\nrose is capable of delighting the ear, or a violin of gratifying the\r\nsmell.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, therefore, all the delicacies which love had set\r\nbefore him, namely, the hopes of seeing Sophia at the masquerade; on\r\nwhich, however ill-founded his imagination might be, he had\r\nvoluptuously feasted during the whole day, the evening no sooner came\r\nthan Mr Jones began to languish for some food of a grosser kind.\r\nPartridge discovered this by intuition, and took the occasion to give\r\nsome oblique hints concerning the bank-bill; and, when these were\r\nrejected with disdain, he collected courage enough once more to\r\nmention a return to Mr Allworthy.\r\n\r\n“Partridge,” cries Jones, “you cannot see my fortune in a more\r\ndesperate light than I see it myself; and I begin heartily to repent\r\nthat I suffered you to leave a place where you was settled, and to\r\nfollow me. However, I insist now on your returning home; and for the\r\nexpense and trouble which you have so kindly put yourself to on my\r\naccount, all the cloaths I left behind in your care I desire you would\r\ntake as your own. I am sorry I can make you no other acknowledgment.”\r\n\r\nHe spoke these words with so pathetic an accent, that Partridge, among\r\nwhose vices ill-nature or hardness of heart were not numbered, burst\r\ninto tears; and after swearing he would not quit him in his distress,\r\nhe began with the most earnest entreaties to urge his return home.\r\n“For heaven's sake, sir,” says he, “do but consider; what can your\r\nhonour do?--how is it possible you can live in this town without\r\nmoney? Do what you will, sir, or go wherever you please, I am resolved\r\nnot to desert you. But pray, sir, consider--do pray, sir, for your own\r\nsake, take it into your consideration; and I'm sure,” says he, “that\r\nyour own good sense will bid you return home.”\r\n\r\n“How often shall I tell thee,” answered Jones, “that I have no home to\r\nreturn to? Had I any hopes that Mr Allworthy's doors would be open to\r\nreceive me, I want no distress to urge me--nay, there is no other\r\ncause upon earth, which could detain me a moment from flying to his\r\npresence; but, alas! that I am for ever banished from. His last words\r\nwere--O, Partridge, they still ring in my ears--his last words were,\r\nwhen he gave me a sum of money--what it was I know not, but\r\nconsiderable I'm sure it was--his last words were--`I am resolved from\r\nthis day forward, on no account to converse with you any more.'”\r\n\r\nHere passion stopt the mouth of Jones, as surprize for a moment did\r\nthat of Partridge; but he soon recovered the use of speech, and after\r\na short preface, in which he declared he had no inquisitiveness in his\r\ntemper, enquired what Jones meant by a considerable sum--he knew not\r\nhow much--and what was become of the money.\r\n\r\nIn both these points he now received full satisfaction; on which he\r\nwas proceeding to comment, when he was interrupted by a message from\r\nMr Nightingale, who desired his master's company in his apartment.\r\n\r\nWhen the two gentlemen were both attired for the masquerade, and Mr\r\nNightingale had given orders for chairs to be sent for, a circumstance\r\nof distress occurred to Jones, which will appear very ridiculous to\r\nmany of my readers. This was how to procure a shilling; but if such\r\nreaders will reflect a little on what they have themselves felt from\r\nthe want of a thousand pounds, or, perhaps, of ten or twenty, to\r\nexecute a favourite scheme, they will have a perfect idea of what Mr\r\nJones felt on this occasion. For this sum, therefore, he applied to\r\nPartridge, which was the first he had permitted him to advance, and\r\nwas the last he intended that poor fellow should advance in his\r\nservice. To say the truth, Partridge had lately made no offer of this\r\nkind. Whether it was that he desired to see the bank-bill broke in\r\nupon, or that distress should prevail on Jones to return home, or from\r\nwhat other motive it proceeded, I will not determine."

      "content": "Containing the whole humours of a masquerade.\r\n\nOur cavaliers now arrived at that temple, where Heydegger, the great\r\nArbiter Deliciarum, the great high-priest of pleasure, presides; and,\r\nlike other heathen priests, imposes on his votaries by the pretended\r\npresence of the deity, when in reality no such deity is there.\r\n\r\nMr Nightingale, having taken a turn or two with his companion, soon\r\nleft him, and walked off with a female, saying, “Now you are here,\r\nsir, you must beat about for your own game.”\r\n\r\nJones began to entertain strong hopes that his Sophia was present; and\r\nthese hopes gave him more spirits than the lights, the music, and the\r\ncompany; though these are pretty strong antidotes against the spleen.\r\nHe now accosted every woman he saw, whose stature, shape, or air, bore\r\nany resemblance to his angel. To all of whom he endeavoured to say\r\nsomething smart, in order to engage an answer, by which he might\r\ndiscover that voice which he thought it impossible he should mistake.\r\nSome of these answered by a question, in a squeaking voice, Do you\r\nknow me? Much the greater number said, I don't know you, sir, and\r\nnothing more. Some called him an impertinent fellow; some made him no\r\nanswer at all; some said, Indeed I don't know your voice, and I shall\r\nhave nothing to say to you; and many gave him as kind answers as he\r\ncould wish, but not in the voice he desired to hear.\r\n\r\nWhilst he was talking with one of these last (who was in the habit of\r\na shepherdess) a lady in a domino came up to him, and slapping him on\r\nthe shoulder, whispered him, at the same time, in the ear, “If you\r\ntalk any longer with that trollop, I will acquaint Miss Western.”\r\n\r\nJones no sooner heard that name, than, immediately quitting his former\r\ncompanion, he applied to the domino, begging and entreating her to\r\nshow him the lady she had mentioned, if she was then in the room.\r\n\r\nThe mask walked hastily to the upper end of the innermost apartment\r\nbefore she spoke; and then, instead of answering him, sat down, and\r\ndeclared she was tired. Jones sat down by her, and still persisted in\r\nhis entreaties; at last the lady coldly answered, “I imagined Mr Jones\r\nhad been a more discerning lover, than to suffer any disguise to\r\nconceal his mistress from him.” “Is she here, then, madam?” replied\r\nJones, with some vehemence. Upon which the lady cried--“Hush, sir, you\r\nwill be observed. I promise you, upon my honour, Miss Western is not\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\nJones, now taking the mask by the hand, fell to entreating her in the\r\nmost earnest manner, to acquaint him where he might find Sophia; and\r\nwhen he could obtain no direct answer, he began to upbraid her gently\r\nfor having disappointed him the day before; and concluded, saying,\r\n“Indeed, my good fairy queen, I know your majesty very well,\r\nnotwithstanding the affected disguise of your voice. Indeed, Mrs\r\nFitzpatrick, it is a little cruel to divert yourself at the expense of\r\nmy torments.”\r\n\r\nThe mask answered, “Though you have so ingeniously discovered me, I\r\nmust still speak in the same voice, lest I should be known by others.\r\nAnd do you think, good sir, that I have no greater regard for my\r\ncousin, than to assist in carrying on an affair between you two, which\r\nmust end in her ruin, as well as your own? Besides, I promise you, my\r\ncousin is not mad enough to consent to her own destruction, if you are\r\nso much her enemy as to tempt her to it.”\r\n\r\n“Alas, madam!” said Jones, “you little know my heart, when you call me\r\nan enemy of Sophia.”\r\n\r\n“And yet to ruin any one,” cries the other, “you will allow, is the\r\nact of an enemy; and when by the same act you must knowingly and\r\ncertainly bring ruin on yourself, is it not folly or madness, as well\r\nas guilt? Now, sir, my cousin hath very little more than her father\r\nwill please to give her; very little for one of her fashion--you know\r\nhim, and you know your own situation.”\r\n\r\nJones vowed he had no such design on Sophia, “That he would rather\r\nsuffer the most violent of deaths than sacrifice her interest to his\r\ndesires.” He said, “he knew how unworthy he was of her, every way,\r\nthat he had long ago resolved to quit all such aspiring thoughts, but\r\nthat some strange accidents had made him desirous to see her once\r\nmore, when he promised he would take leave of her for ever. No,\r\nmadam,” concluded he, “my love is not of that base kind which seeks\r\nits own satisfaction at the expense of what is most dear to its\r\nobject. I would sacrifice everything to the possession of my Sophia,\r\nbut Sophia herself.”\r\n\r\nThough the reader may have already conceived no very sublime idea of\r\nthe virtue of the lady in the mask; and though possibly she may\r\nhereafter appear not to deserve one of the first characters of her\r\nsex; yet, it is certain, these generous sentiments made a strong\r\nimpression upon her, and greatly added to the affection she had before\r\nconceived for our young heroe.\r\n\r\nThe lady now, after silence of a few moments, said, “She did not see\r\nhis pretensions to Sophia so much in the light of presumption, as of\r\nimprudence. Young fellows,” says she, “can never have too aspiring\r\nthoughts. I love ambition in a young man, and I would have you\r\ncultivate it as much as possible. Perhaps you may succeed with those\r\nwho are infinitely superior in fortune; nay, I am convinced there are\r\nwomen----but don't you think me a strange creature, Mr Jones, to be\r\nthus giving advice to a man with whom I am so little acquainted, and\r\none with whose behaviour to me I have so little reason to be pleased?”\r\n\r\nHere Jones began to apologize, and to hope he had not offended in\r\nanything he had said of her cousin.--To which the mask answered, “And\r\nare you so little versed in the sex, to imagine you can well affront a\r\nlady more than by entertaining her with your passion for another\r\nwoman? If the fairy queen had conceived no better opinion of your\r\ngallantry, she would scarce have appointed you to meet her at the\r\nmasquerade.”\r\n\r\nJones had never less inclination to an amour than at present; but\r\ngallantry to the ladies was among his principles of honour; and he\r\nheld it as much incumbent on him to accept a challenge to love, as if\r\nit had been a challenge to fight. Nay, his very love to Sophia made it\r\nnecessary for him to keep well with the lady, as he made no doubt but\r\nshe was capable of bringing him into the presence of the other.\r\n\r\nHe began therefore to make a very warm answer to her last speech, when\r\na mask, in the character of an old woman, joined them. This mask was\r\none of those ladies who go to a masquerade only to vent ill-nature, by\r\ntelling people rude truths, and by endeavouring, as the phrase is, to\r\nspoil as much sport as they are able. This good lady, therefore,\r\nhaving observed Jones, and his friend, whom she well knew, in close\r\nconsultation together in a corner of the room, concluded she could\r\nnowhere satisfy her spleen better than by interrupting them. She\r\nattacked them, therefore, and soon drove them from their retirement;\r\nnor was she contented with this, but pursued them to every place which\r\nthey shifted to avoid her; till Mr Nightingale, seeing the distress of\r\nhis friend, at last relieved him, and engaged the old woman in another\r\npursuit.\r\n\r\nWhile Jones and his mask were walking together about the room, to rid\r\nthemselves of the teazer, he observed his lady speak to several masks,\r\nwith the same freedom of acquaintance as if they had been barefaced.\r\nHe could not help expressing his surprize at this; saying, “Sure,\r\nmadam, you must have infinite discernment, to know people in all\r\ndisguises.” To which the lady answered, “You cannot conceive anything\r\nmore insipid and childish than a masquerade to the people of fashion,\r\nwho in general know one another as well here as when they meet in an\r\nassembly or a drawing-room; nor will any woman of condition converse\r\nwith a person with whom she is not acquainted. In short, the\r\ngenerality of persons whom you see here may more properly be said to\r\nkill time in this place than in any other; and generally retire from\r\nhence more tired than from the longest sermon. To say the truth, I\r\nbegin to be in that situation myself; and if I have any faculty at\r\nguessing, you are not much better pleased. I protest it would be\r\nalmost charity in me to go home for your sake.” “I know but one\r\ncharity equal to it,” cries Jones, “and that is to suffer me to wait\r\non you home.” “Sure,” answered the lady, “you have a strange opinion\r\nof me, to imagine, that upon such an acquaintance, I would let you\r\ninto my doors at this time of night. I fancy you impute the friendship\r\nI have shown my cousin to some other motive. Confess honestly; don't\r\nyou consider this contrived interview as little better than a\r\ndownright assignation? Are you used, Mr Jones, to make these sudden\r\nconquests?” “I am not used, madam,” said Jones, “to submit to such\r\nsudden conquests; but as you have taken my heart by surprize, the rest\r\nof my body hath a right to follow; so you must pardon me if I resolve\r\nto attend you wherever you go.” He accompanied these words with some\r\nproper actions; upon which the lady, after a gentle rebuke, and saying\r\ntheir familiarity would be observed, told him, “She was going to sup\r\nwith an acquaintance, whither she hoped he would not follow her; for\r\nif you should,” said she, “I shall be thought an unaccountable\r\ncreature, though my friend indeed is not censorious: yet I hope you\r\nwon't follow me; I protest I shall not know what to say if you do.”\r\n\r\nThe lady presently after quitted the masquerade, and Jones,\r\nnotwithstanding the severe prohibition he had received, presumed to\r\nattend her. He was now reduced to the same dilemma we have mentioned\r\nbefore, namely, the want of a shilling, and could not relieve it by\r\nborrowing as before. He therefore walked boldly on after the chair in\r\nwhich his lady rode, pursued by a grand huzza, from all the chairmen\r\npresent, who wisely take the best care they can to discountenance all\r\nwalking afoot by their betters. Luckily, however, the gentry who\r\nattend at the Opera-house were too busy to quit their stations, and as\r\nthe lateness of the hour prevented him from meeting many of their\r\nbrethren in the street, he proceeded without molestation, in a dress,\r\nwhich, at another season, would have certainly raised a mob at his\r\nheels.\r\n\r\nThe lady was set down in a street not far from Hanover-square, where\r\nthe door being presently opened, she was carried in, and the\r\ngentleman, without any ceremony, walked in after her.\r\n\r\nJones and his companion were now together in a very well-furnished and\r\nwell-warmed room; when the female, still speaking in her masquerade\r\nvoice, said she was surprized at her friend, who must absolutely have\r\nforgot her appointment; at which, after venting much resentment, she\r\nsuddenly exprest some apprehension from Jones, and asked him what the\r\nworld would think of their having been alone together in a house at\r\nthat time of night? But instead of a direct answer to so important a\r\nquestion, Jones began to be very importunate with the lady to unmask;\r\nand at length having prevailed, there appeared not Mrs Fitzpatrick,\r\nbut the Lady Bellaston herself.\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious to give the particular conversation, which\r\nconsisted of very common and ordinary occurrences, and which lasted\r\nfrom two till six o'clock in the morning. It is sufficient to mention\r\nall of it that is anywise material to this history. And this was a\r\npromise that the lady would endeavour to find out Sophia, and in a few\r\ndays bring him to an interview with her, on condition that he would\r\nthen take his leave of her. When this was thoroughly settled, and a\r\nsecond meeting in the evening appointed at the same place, they\r\nseparated; the lady returned to her house, and Jones to his lodgings."

      "title": "Chapter viii.",
      "content": "Containing a scene of distress, which will appear very extraordinary\r\nto most of our readers.\r\n\nJones having refreshed himself with a few hours' sleep, summoned\r\nPartridge to his presence; and delivering him a bank-note of fifty\r\npounds, ordered him to go and change it. Partridge received this with\r\nsparkling eyes, though, when he came to reflect farther, it raised in\r\nhim some suspicions not very advantageous to the honour of his master:\r\nto these the dreadful idea he had of the masquerade, the disguise in\r\nwhich his master had gone out and returned, and his having been abroad\r\nall night, contributed. In plain language, the only way he could\r\npossibly find to account for the possession of this note, was by\r\nrobbery: and, to confess the truth, the reader, unless he should\r\nsuspect it was owing to the generosity of Lady Bellaston, can hardly\r\nimagine any other.\r\n\r\nTo clear, therefore, the honour of Mr Jones, and to do justice to the\r\nliberality of the lady, he had really received this present from her,\r\nwho, though she did not give much into the hackney charities of the\r\nage, such as building hospitals, &c., was not, however, entirely void\r\nof that Christian virtue; and conceived (very rightly I think) that a\r\nyoung fellow of merit, without a shilling in the world, was no\r\nimproper object of this virtue.\r\n\r\nMr Jones and Mr Nightingale had been invited to dine this day with Mrs\r\nMiller. At the appointed hour, therefore, the two young gentlemen,\r\nwith the two girls, attended in the parlour, where they waited from\r\nthree till almost five before the good woman appeared. She had been\r\nout of town to visit a relation, of whom, at her return, she gave the\r\nfollowing account.\r\n\r\n“I hope, gentlemen, you will pardon my making you wait; I am sure if\r\nyou knew the occasion--I have been to see a cousin of mine, about six\r\nmiles off, who now lies in.--It should be a warning to all persons\r\n(says she, looking at her daughters) how they marry indiscreetly.\r\nThere is no happiness in this world without a competency. O Nancy! how\r\nshall I describe the wretched condition in which I found your poor\r\ncousin? she hath scarce lain in a week, and there was she, this\r\ndreadful weather, in a cold room, without any curtains to her bed, and\r\nnot a bushel of coals in her house to supply her with fire; her second\r\nson, that sweet little fellow, lies ill of a quinzy in the same bed\r\nwith his mother; for there is no other bed in the house. Poor little\r\nTommy! I believe, Nancy, you will never see your favourite any more;\r\nfor he is really very ill. The rest of the children are in pretty good\r\nhealth: but Molly, I am afraid, will do herself an injury: she is but\r\nthirteen years old, Mr Nightingale, and yet, in my life, I never saw a\r\nbetter nurse: she tends both her mother and her brother; and, what is\r\nwonderful in a creature so young, she shows all the chearfulness in\r\nthe world to her mother; and yet I saw her--I saw the poor child, Mr\r\nNightingale, turn about, and privately wipe the tears from her eyes.”\r\n Here Mrs Miller was prevented, by her own tears, from going on, and\r\nthere was not, I believe, a person present who did not accompany her\r\nin them; at length she a little recovered herself, and proceeded thus:\r\n“In all this distress the mother supports her spirits in a surprizing\r\nmanner. The danger of her son sits heaviest upon her, and yet she\r\nendeavours as much as possible to conceal even this concern, on her\r\nhusband's account. Her grief, however, sometimes gets the better of\r\nall her endeavours; for she was always extravagantly fond of this boy,\r\nand a most sensible, sweet-tempered creature it is. I protest I was\r\nnever more affected in my life than when I heard the little wretch,\r\nwho is hardly yet seven years old, while his mother was wetting him\r\nwith her tears, beg her to be comforted. `Indeed, mamma,' cried the\r\nchild, `I shan't die; God Almighty, I'm sure, won't take Tommy away;\r\nlet heaven be ever so fine a place, I had rather stay here and starve\r\nwith you and my papa than go to it.' Pardon me, gentlemen, I can't\r\nhelp it” (says she, wiping her eyes), “such sensibility and affection\r\nin a child.--And yet, perhaps, he is least the object of pity; for a\r\nday or two will, most probably, place him beyond the reach of all\r\nhuman evils. The father is, indeed, most worthy of compassion. Poor\r\nman, his countenance is the very picture of horror, and he looks like\r\none rather dead than alive. Oh heavens! what a scene did I behold at\r\nmy first coming into the room! The good creature was lying behind the\r\nbolster, supporting at once both his child and his wife. He had\r\nnothing on but a thin waistcoat; for his coat was spread over the bed,\r\nto supply the want of blankets.--When he rose up at my entrance, I\r\nscarce knew him. As comely a man, Mr Jones, within this fortnight, as\r\nyou ever beheld; Mr Nightingale hath seen him. His eyes sunk, his face\r\npale, with a long beard. His body shivering with cold, and worn with\r\nhunger too; for my cousin says she can hardly prevail upon him to\r\neat.--He told me himself in a whisper--he told me--I can't repeat\r\nit--he said he could not bear to eat the bread his children wanted.\r\nAnd yet, can you believe it, gentlemen? in all this misery his wife\r\nhas as good caudle as if she lay in the midst of the greatest\r\naffluence; I tasted it, and I scarce ever tasted better.--The means of\r\nprocuring her this, he said, he believed was sent him by an angel from\r\nheaven. I know not what he meant; for I had not spirits enough to ask\r\na single question.\r\n\r\n“This was a love-match, as they call it, on both sides; that is, a\r\nmatch between two beggars. I must, indeed, say, I never saw a fonder\r\ncouple; but what is their fondness good for, but to torment each\r\nother?” “Indeed, mamma,” cries Nancy, “I have always looked on my\r\ncousin Anderson” (for that was her name) “as one of the happiest of\r\nwomen.” “I am sure,” says Mrs Miller, “the case at present is much\r\notherwise; for any one might have discerned that the tender\r\nconsideration of each other's sufferings makes the most intolerable\r\npart of their calamity, both to the husband and wife. Compared to\r\nwhich, hunger and cold, as they affect their own persons only, are\r\nscarce evils. Nay, the very children, the youngest, which is not two\r\nyears old, excepted, feel in the same manner; for they are a most\r\nloving family, and, if they had but a bare competency, would be the\r\nhappiest people in the world.” “I never saw the least sign of misery\r\nat her house,” replied Nancy; “I am sure my heart bleeds for what you\r\nnow tell me.”--“O child,” answered the mother, “she hath always\r\nendeavoured to make the best of everything. They have always been in\r\ngreat distress; but, indeed, this absolute ruin hath been brought upon\r\nthem by others. The poor man was bail for the villain his brother; and\r\nabout a week ago, the very day before her lying-in, their goods were\r\nall carried away, and sold by an execution. He sent a letter to me of\r\nit by one of the bailiffs, which the villain never delivered.--What\r\nmust he think of my suffering a week to pass before he heard of me?”\r\n\r\nIt was not with dry eyes that Jones heard this narrative; when it was\r\nended he took Mrs Miller apart with him into another room, and,\r\ndelivering her his purse, in which was the sum of £50, desired her to\r\nsend as much of it as she thought proper to these poor people. The\r\nlook which Mrs Miller gave Jones, on this occasion, is not easy to be\r\ndescribed. She burst into a kind of agony of transport, and cryed\r\nout--“Good heavens! is there such a man in the world?”--But\r\nrecollecting herself, she said, “Indeed I know one such; but can there\r\nbe another?” “I hope, madam,” cries Jones, “there are many who have\r\ncommon humanity; for to relieve such distresses in our fellow-creatures,\r\ncan hardly be called more.” Mrs Miller then took ten guineas, which\r\nwere the utmost he could prevail with her to accept, and said, “She\r\nwould find some means of conveying them early the next morning;”\r\n adding, “that she had herself done some little matter for the poor\r\npeople, and had not left them in quite so much misery as she found\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nThey then returned to the parlour, where Nightingale expressed much\r\nconcern at the dreadful situation of these wretches, whom indeed he\r\nknew; for he had seen them more than once at Mrs Miller's. He\r\ninveighed against the folly of making oneself liable for the debts of\r\nothers; vented many bitter execrations against the brother; and\r\nconcluded with wishing something could be done for the unfortunate\r\nfamily. “Suppose, madam,” said he, “you should recommend them to Mr\r\nAllworthy? Or what think you of a collection? I will give them a\r\nguinea with all my heart.”\r\n\r\nMrs Miller made no answer; and Nancy, to whom her mother had whispered\r\nthe generosity of Jones, turned pale upon the occasion; though, if\r\neither of them was angry with Nightingale, it was surely without\r\nreason. For the liberality of Jones, if he had known it, was not an\r\nexample which he had any obligation to follow; and there are thousands\r\nwho would not have contributed a single halfpenny, as indeed he did\r\nnot in effect, for he made no tender of anything; and therefore, as\r\nthe others thought proper to make no demand, he kept his money in his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\nI have, in truth, observed, and shall never have a better opportunity\r\nthan at present to communicate my observation, that the world are in\r\ngeneral divided into two opinions concerning charity, which are the\r\nvery reverse of each other. One party seems to hold, that all acts of\r\nthis kind are to be esteemed as voluntary gifts, and, however little\r\nyou give (if indeed no more than your good wishes), you acquire a\r\ngreat degree of merit in so doing. Others, on the contrary, appear to\r\nbe as firmly persuaded, that beneficence is a positive duty, and that\r\nwhenever the rich fall greatly short of their ability in relieving the\r\ndistresses of the poor, their pitiful largesses are so far from being\r\nmeritorious, that they have only performed their duty by halves, and\r\nare in some sense more contemptible than those who have entirely\r\nneglected it.\r\n\r\nTo reconcile these different opinions is not in my power. I shall only\r\nadd, that the givers are generally of the former sentiment, and the\r\nreceivers are almost universally inclined to the latter."

But I am so far from\r\ndesiring to exhibit such pictures to the public, that I would wish to\r\ndraw a curtain over those that have been lately set forth in certain\r\nFrench novels; very bungling copies of which have been presented us\r\nhere under the name of translations.\r\n\r\nJones grew still more and more impatient to see Sophia; and finding,\r\nafter repeated interviews with Lady Bellaston, no likelihood of\r\nobtaining this by her means (for, on the contrary, the lady began to\r\ntreat even the mention of the name of Sophia with resentment), he\r\nresolved to try some other method. He made no doubt but that Lady\r\nBellaston knew where his angel was, so he thought it most likely that\r\nsome of her servants should be acquainted with the same secret.\r\nPartridge therefore was employed to get acquainted with those\r\nservants, in order to fish this secret out of them.\r\n\r\nFew situations can be imagined more uneasy than that to which his poor\r\nmaster was at present reduced; for besides the difficulties he met\r\nwith in discovering Sophia, besides the fears he had of having\r\ndisobliged her, and the assurances he had received from Lady Bellaston\r\nof the resolution which Sophia had taken against him, and of her\r\nhaving purposely concealed herself from him, which he had sufficient\r\nreason to believe might be true; he had still a difficulty to combat\r\nwhich it was not in the power of his mistress to remove, however kind\r\nher inclination might have been. This was the exposing of her to be\r\ndisinherited of all her father's estate, the almost inevitable\r\nconsequence of their coming together without a consent, which he had\r\nno hopes of ever obtaining.\r\n\r\nAdd to all these the many obligations which Lady Bellaston, whose\r\nviolent fondness we can no longer conceal, had heaped upon him; so\r\nthat by her means he was now become one of the best-dressed men about\r\ntown; and was not only relieved from those ridiculous distresses we\r\nhave before mentioned, but was actually raised to a state of affluence\r\nbeyond what he had ever known.\r\n\r\nNow, though there are many gentlemen who very well reconcile it to\r\ntheir consciences to possess themselves of the whole fortune of a\r\nwoman, without making her any kind of return; yet to a mind, the\r\nproprietor of which doth not deserved to be hanged, nothing is, I\r\nbelieve, more irksome than to support love with gratitude only;\r\nespecially where inclination pulls the heart a contrary way. Such was\r\nthe unhappy case of Jones; for though the virtuous love he bore to\r\nSophia, and which left very little affection for any other woman, had\r\nbeen entirely out of the question, he could never have been able to\r\nhave made any adequate return to the generous passion of this lady,\r\nwho had indeed been once an object of desire, but was now entered at\r\nleast into the autumn of life, though she wore all the gaiety of\r\nyouth, both in her dress and manner; nay, she contrived still to\r\nmaintain the roses in her cheeks; but these, like flowers forced out\r\nof season by art, had none of that lively blooming freshness with\r\nwhich Nature, at the proper time, bedecks her own productions. She\r\nhad, besides, a certain imperfection, which renders some flowers,\r\nthough very beautiful to the eye, very improper to be placed in a\r\nwilderness of sweets, and what above all others is most disagreeable\r\nto the breath of love.\r\n\r\nThough Jones saw all these discouragements on the one side, he felt\r\nhis obligations full as strongly on the other; nor did he less plainly\r\ndiscern the ardent passion whence those obligations proceeded, the\r\nextreme violence of which if he failed to equal, he well knew the lady\r\nwould think him ungrateful; and, what is worse, he would have thought\r\nhimself so. He knew the tacit consideration upon which all her favours\r\nwere conferred; and as his necessity obliged him to accept them, so\r\nhis honour, he concluded, forced him to pay the price. This therefore\r\nhe resolved to do, whatever misery it cost him, and to devote himself\r\nto her, from that great principle of justice, by which the laws of\r\nsome countries oblige a debtor, who is no otherwise capable of\r\ndischarging his debt, to become the slave of his creditor.\r\n\r\nWhile he was meditating on these matters, he received the following\r\nnote from the lady:--\r\n\r\n “A very foolish, but a very perverse accident hath happened since\r\n our last meeting, which makes it improper I should see you any more\r\n at the usual place. I will, if possible, contrive some other place\r\n by to-morrow. In the meantime, adieu.”\r\n\r\nThis disappointment, perhaps, the reader may conclude was not very\r\ngreat; but if it was, he was quickly relieved; for in less than an\r\nhour afterwards another note was brought him from the same hand, which\r\ncontained as follows:--\r\n\r\n “I have altered my mind since I wrote; a change which, if you are no\r\n stranger to the tenderest of all passions, you will not wonder at. I\r\n am now resolved to see you this evening at my own house, whatever\r\n may be the consequence. Come to me exactly at seven; I dine abroad,\r\n but will be at home by that time. A day, I find, to those that\r\n sincerely love, seems longer than I imagined.\r\n\r\n “If you should accidentally be a few moments before me, bid them\r\n show you into the drawing-room.”\r\n\r\nTo confess the truth, Jones was less pleased with this last epistle\r\nthan he had been with the former, as he was prevented by it from\r\ncomplying with the earnest entreaties of Mr Nightingale, with whom he\r\nhad now contracted much intimacy and friendship. These entreaties were\r\nto go with that young gentleman and his company to a new play, which\r\nwas to be acted that evening, and which a very large party had agreed\r\nto damn, from some dislike they had taken to the author, who was a\r\nfriend to one of Mr Nightingale's acquaintance. And this sort of fun,\r\nour heroe, we are ashamed to confess, would willingly have preferred\r\nto the above kind appointment; but his honour got the better of his\r\ninclination.\r\n\r\nBefore we attend him to this intended interview with the lady, we\r\nthink proper to account for both the preceding notes, as the reader\r\nmay possibly be not a little surprized at the imprudence of Lady\r\nBellaston, in bringing her lover to the very house where her rival was\r\nlodged.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, the mistress of the house where these lovers had hitherto\r\nmet, and who had been for some years a pensioner to that lady, was now\r\nbecome a methodist, and had that very morning waited upon her\r\nladyship, and after rebuking her very severely for her past life, had\r\npositively declared that she would, on no account, be instrumental in\r\ncarrying on any of her affairs for the future.\r\n\r\nThe hurry of spirits into which this accident threw the lady made her\r\ndespair of possibly finding any other convenience to meet Jones that\r\nevening; but as she began a little to recover from her uneasiness at\r\nthe disappointment, she set her thoughts to work, when luckily it came\r\ninto her head to propose to Sophia to go to the play, which was\r\nimmediately consented to, and a proper lady provided for her\r\ncompanion. Mrs Honour was likewise despatched with Mrs Etoff on the\r\nsame errand of pleasure; and thus her own house was left free for the\r\nsafe reception of Mr Jones, with whom she promised herself two or\r\nthree hours of uninterrupted conversation after her return from the\r\nplace where she dined, which was at a friend's house in a pretty\r\ndistant part of the town, near her old place of assignation, where she\r\nhad engaged herself before she was well apprized of the revolution\r\nthat had happened in the mind and morals of her late confidante."

      "content": "A chapter which, though short, may draw tears from some eyes.\r\n\nMr Jones was just dressed to wait on Lady Bellaston, when Mrs Miller\r\nrapped at his door; and, being admitted, very earnestly desired his\r\ncompany below-stairs, to drink tea in the parlour.\r\n\r\nUpon his entrance into the room, she presently introduced a person to\r\nhim, saying, “This, sir, is my cousin, who hath been so greatly\r\nbeholden to your goodness, for which he begs to return you his\r\nsincerest thanks.”\r\n\r\nThe man had scarce entered upon that speech which Mrs Miller had so\r\nkindly prefaced, when both Jones and he, looking stedfastly at each\r\nother, showed at once the utmost tokens of surprize. The voice of the\r\nlatter began instantly to faulter; and, instead of finishing his\r\nspeech, he sunk down into a chair, crying, “It is so, I am convinced\r\nit is so!”\r\n\r\n“Bless me! what's the meaning of this?” cries Mrs Miller; “you are not\r\nill, I hope, cousin? Some water, a dram this instant.”\r\n\r\n“Be not frighted, madam,” cries Jones, “I have almost as much need of\r\na dram as your cousin. We are equally surprized at this unexpected\r\nmeeting. Your cousin is an acquaintance of mine, Mrs Miller.”\r\n\r\n“An acquaintance!” cries the man.--“Oh, heaven!”\r\n\r\n“Ay, an acquaintance,” repeated Jones, “and an honoured acquaintance\r\ntoo. When I do not love and honour the man who dares venture\r\neverything to preserve his wife and children from instant destruction,\r\nmay I have a friend capable of disowning me in adversity!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you are an excellent young man,” cries Mrs Miller:--“Yes, indeed,\r\npoor creature! he hath ventured everything.--If he had not had one of\r\nthe best of constitutions, it must have killed him.”\r\n\r\n“Cousin,” cries the man, who had now pretty well recovered himself,\r\n“this is the angel from heaven whom I meant. This is he to whom,\r\nbefore I saw you, I owed the preservation of my Peggy. He it was to\r\nwhose generosity every comfort, every support which I have procured\r\nfor her, was owing. He is, indeed, the worthiest, bravest, noblest; of\r\nall human beings. O cousin, I have obligations to this gentleman of\r\nsuch a nature!”\r\n\r\n“Mention nothing of obligations,” cries Jones eagerly; “not a word, I\r\ninsist upon it, not a word” (meaning, I suppose, that he would not\r\nhave him betray the affair of the robbery to any person). “If, by the\r\ntrifle you have received from me, I have preserved a whole family,\r\nsure pleasure was never bought so cheap.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, sir!” cries the man, “I wish you could this instant see my house.\r\nIf any person had ever a right to the pleasure you mention, I am\r\nconvinced it is yourself. My cousin tells me she acquainted you with\r\nthe distress in which she found us. That, sir, is all greatly removed,\r\nand chiefly by your goodness.----My children have now a bed to lie\r\non----and they have----they have----eternal blessings reward you for\r\nit!----they have bread to eat. My little boy is recovered; my wife is\r\nout of danger, and I am happy. All, all owing to you, sir, and to my\r\ncousin here, one of the best of women. Indeed, sir, I must see you at\r\nmy house.--Indeed my wife must see you, and thank you.--My children\r\ntoo must express their gratitude.----Indeed, sir, they are not without\r\na sense of their obligation; but what is my feeling when I reflect to\r\nwhom I owe that they are now capable of expressing their\r\ngratitude.----Oh, sir, the little hearts which you have warmed had now\r\nbeen cold as ice without your assistance.”\r\n\r\nHere Jones attempted to prevent the poor man from proceeding; but\r\nindeed the overflowing of his own heart would of itself have stopped\r\nhis words. And now Mrs Miller likewise began to pour forth\r\nthanksgivings, as well in her own name, as in that of her cousin, and\r\nconcluded with saying, “She doubted not but such goodness would meet a\r\nglorious reward.”\r\n\r\nJones answered, “He had been sufficiently rewarded already. Your\r\ncousin's account, madam,” said he, “hath given me a sensation more\r\npleasing than I have ever known. He must be a wretch who is unmoved at\r\nhearing such a story; how transporting then must be the thought of\r\nhaving happily acted a part in this scene! If there are men who cannot\r\nfeel the delight of giving happiness to others, I sincerely pity them,\r\nas they are incapable of tasting what is, in my opinion, a greater\r\nhonour, a higher interest, and a sweeter pleasure than the ambitious,\r\nthe avaricious, or the voluptuous man can ever obtain.”\r\n\r\nThe hour of appointment being now come, Jones was forced to take a\r\nhasty leave, but not before he had heartily shaken his friend by the\r\nhand, and desired to see him again as soon as possible; promising that\r\nhe would himself take the first opportunity of visiting him at his own\r\nhouse. He then stept into his chair, and proceeded to Lady\r\nBellaston's, greatly exulting in the happiness which he had procured\r\nto this poor family; nor could he forbear reflecting, without horror,\r\non the dreadful consequences which must have attended them, had he\r\nlistened rather to the voice of strict justice than to that of mercy,\r\nwhen he was attacked on the high road.\r\n\r\nMrs Miller sung forth the praises of Jones during the whole evening,\r\nin which Mr Anderson, while he stayed, so passionately accompanied\r\nher, that he was often on the very point of mentioning the\r\ncircumstance of the robbery. However, he luckily recollected himself,\r\nand avoided an indiscretion which would have been so much the greater,\r\nas he knew Mrs Miller to be extremely strict and nice in her\r\nprinciples. He was likewise well apprized of the loquacity of this\r\nlady; and yet such was his gratitude, that it had almost got the\r\nbetter both of discretion and shame, and made him publish that which\r\nwould have defamed his own character, rather than omit any\r\ncircumstances which might do the fullest honour to his benefactor."

      "content": "In which the reader will be surprized.\r\n\nMr Jones was rather earlier than the time appointed, and earlier than\r\nthe lady; whose arrival was hindered, not only by the distance of the\r\nplace where she dined, but by some other cross accidents very\r\nvexatious to one in her situation of mind. He was accordingly shown\r\ninto the drawing-room, where he had not been many minutes before the\r\ndoor opened, and in came----no other than Sophia herself, who had left\r\nthe play before the end of the first act; for this, as we have already\r\nsaid, being, a new play, at which two large parties met, the one to\r\ndamn, and the other to applaud, a violent uproar, and an engagement\r\nbetween the two parties, had so terrified our heroine, that she was\r\nglad to put herself under the protection of a young gentleman who\r\nsafely conveyed her to her chair.\r\n\r\nAs Lady Bellaston had acquainted her that she should not be at home\r\ntill late, Sophia, expecting to find no one in the room, came hastily\r\nin, and went directly to a glass which almost fronted her, without\r\nonce looking towards the upper end of the room, where the statue of\r\nJones now stood motionless.---In this glass it was, after\r\ncontemplating her own lovely face, that she first discovered the said\r\nstatue; when, instantly turning about, she perceived the reality of\r\nthe vision: upon which she gave a violent scream, and scarce preserved\r\nherself from fainting, till Jones was able to move to her, and support\r\nher in his arms.\r\n\r\nTo paint the looks or thoughts of either of these lovers, is beyond my\r\npower. As their sensations, from their mutual silence, may be judged\r\nto have been too big for their own utterance, it cannot be supposed\r\nthat I should be able to express them: and the misfortune is, that few\r\nof my readers have been enough in love to feel by their own hearts\r\nwhat past at this time in theirs.\r\n\r\nAfter a short pause, Jones, with faultering accents, said--“I see,\r\nmadam, you are surprized.”--“Surprized!” answered she; “Oh heavens!\r\nIndeed, I am surprized. I almost doubt whether you are the person you\r\nseem.”--“Indeed,” cries he, “my Sophia, pardon me, madam, for this\r\nonce calling you so, I am that very wretched Jones, whom fortune,\r\nafter so many disappointments, hath, at last, kindly conducted to you.\r\nOh! my Sophia, did you know the thousand torments I have suffered in\r\nthis long, fruitless pursuit.”--“Pursuit of whom?” said Sophia, a\r\nlittle recollecting herself, and assuming a reserved air.--“Can you be\r\nso cruel to ask that question?” cries Jones; “Need I say, of you?” “Of\r\nme!” answered Sophia: “Hath Mr Jones, then, any such important\r\nbusiness with me?”--“To some, madam,” cries Jones, “this might seem an\r\nimportant business” (giving her the pocket-book). “I hope, madam, you\r\nwill find it of the same value as when it was lost.” Sophia took the\r\npocket-book, and was going to speak, when he interrupted her\r\nthus:--“Let us not, I beseech you, lose one of these precious moments\r\nwhich fortune hath so kindly sent us. O, my Sophia! I have business of\r\na much superior kind. Thus, on my knees, let me ask your pardon.”--“My\r\npardon!” cries she; “Sure, sir, after what is past, you cannot expect,\r\nafter what I have heard.”--“I scarce know what I say,” answered Jones.\r\n“By heavens! I scarce wish you should pardon me. O my Sophia!\r\nhenceforth never cast away a thought on such a wretch as I am. If any\r\nremembrance of me should ever intrude to give a moment's uneasiness to\r\nthat tender bosom, think of my unworthiness; and let the remembrance\r\nof what passed at Upton blot me for ever from your mind.”\r\n\r\nSophia stood trembling all this while. Her face was whiter than snow,\r\nand her heart was throbbing through her stays. But, at the mention of\r\nUpton, a blush arose in her cheeks, and her eyes, which before she had\r\nscarce lifted up, were turned upon Jones with a glance of disdain. He\r\nunderstood this silent reproach, and replied to it thus: “O my Sophia!\r\nmy only love! you cannot hate or despise me more for what happened\r\nthere than I do myself; but yet do me the justice to think that my\r\nheart was never unfaithful to you. That had no share in the folly I\r\nwas guilty of; it was even then unalterably yours. Though I despaired\r\nof possessing you, nay, almost of ever seeing you more, I doated still\r\non your charming idea, and could seriously love no other woman. But if\r\nmy heart had not been engaged, she, into whose company I accidently\r\nfell at that cursed place, was not an object of serious love. Believe\r\nme, my angel, I never have seen her from that day to this; and never\r\nintend or desire to see her again.” Sophia, in her heart, was very\r\nglad to hear this; but forcing into her face an air of more coldness\r\nthan she had yet assumed, “Why,” said she, “Mr Jones, do you take the\r\ntrouble to make a defence where you are not accused? If I thought it\r\nworth while to accuse you, I have a charge of unpardonable nature\r\nindeed.”--“What is it, for heaven's sake?” answered Jones, trembling\r\nand pale, expecting to hear of his amour with Lady Bellaston. “Oh,”\r\n said she, “how is it possible! can everything noble and everything\r\nbase be lodged together in the same bosom?” Lady Bellaston, and the\r\nignominious circumstance of having been kept, rose again in his mind,\r\nand stopt his mouth from any reply. “Could I have expected,” proceeded\r\nSophia, “such treatment from you? Nay, from any gentleman, from any\r\nman of honour? To have my name traduced in public; in inns, among the\r\nmeanest vulgar! to have any little favours that my unguarded heart may\r\nhave too lightly betrayed me to grant, boasted of there! nay, even to\r\nhear that you had been forced to fly from my love!”\r\n\r\nNothing could equal Jones's surprize at these words of Sophia; but\r\nyet, not being guilty, he was much less embarrassed how to defend\r\nhimself than if she had touched that tender string at which his\r\nconscience had been alarmed. By some examination he presently found,\r\nthat her supposing him guilty of so shocking an outrage against his\r\nlove, and her reputation, was entirely owing to Partridge's talk at\r\nthe inns before landlords and servants; for Sophia confessed to him it\r\nwas from them that she received her intelligence. He had no very great\r\ndifficulty to make her believe that he was entirely innocent of an\r\noffence so foreign to his character; but she had a great deal to\r\nhinder him from going instantly home, and putting Partridge to death,\r\nwhich he more than once swore he would do. This point being cleared\r\nup, they soon found themselves so well pleased with each other, that\r\nJones quite forgot he had begun the conversation with conjuring her to\r\ngive up all thoughts of him; and she was in a temper to have given ear\r\nto a petition of a very different nature; for before they were aware\r\nthey had both gone so far, that he let fall some words that sounded\r\nlike a proposal of marriage. To which she replied, “That, did not her\r\nduty to her father forbid her to follow her own inclinations, ruin\r\nwith him would be more welcome to her than the most affluent fortune\r\nwith another man.” At the mention of the word ruin, he started, let\r\ndrop her hand, which he had held for some time, and striking his\r\nbreast with his own, cried out, “Oh, Sophia! can I then ruin thee? No;\r\nby heavens, no! I never will act so base a part. Dearest Sophia,\r\nwhatever it costs me, I will renounce you; I will give you up; I will\r\ntear all such hopes from my heart as are inconsistent with your real\r\ngood. My love I will ever retain, but it shall be in silence; it shall\r\nbe at a distance from you; it shall be in some foreign land; from\r\nwhence no voice, no sigh of my despair, shall ever reach and disturb\r\nyour ears. And when I am dead”--He would have gone on, but was stopt\r\nby a flood of tears which Sophia let fall in his bosom, upon which she\r\nleaned, without being able to speak one word. He kissed them off,\r\nwhich, for some moments, she allowed him to do without any resistance;\r\nbut then recollecting herself, gently withdrew out of his arms; and,\r\nto turn the discourse from a subject too tender, and which she found\r\nshe could not support, bethought herself to ask him a question she\r\nnever had time to put to him before, “How he came into that room?” He\r\nbegan to stammer, and would, in all probability, have raised her\r\nsuspicions by the answer he was going to give, when, at once, the door\r\nopened, and in came Lady Bellaston.\r\n\r\nHaving advanced a few steps, and seeing Jones and Sophia together, she\r\nsuddenly stopt; when, after a pause of a few moments, recollecting\r\nherself with admirable presence of mind, she said--though with\r\nsufficient indications of surprize both in voice and countenance--“I\r\nthought, Miss Western, you had been at the play?”\r\n\r\nThough Sophia had no opportunity of learning of Jones by what means he\r\nhad discovered her, yet, as she had not the least suspicion of the\r\nreal truth, or that Jones and Lady Bellaston were acquainted, so she\r\nwas very little confounded; and the less, as the lady had, in all\r\ntheir conversations on the subject, entirely taken her side against\r\nher father. With very little hesitation, therefore, she went through\r\nthe whole story of what had happened at the play-house, and the cause\r\nof her hasty return.\r\n\r\nThe length of this narrative gave Lady Bellaston an opportunity of\r\nrallying her spirits, and of considering in what manner to act. And as\r\nthe behaviour of Sophia gave her hopes that Jones had not betrayed\r\nher, she put on an air of good humour, and said, “I should not have\r\nbroke in so abruptly upon you, Miss Western, if I had known you had\r\ncompany.”\r\n\r\nLady Bellaston fixed her eyes on Sophia whilst she spoke these words.\r\nTo which that poor young lady, having her face overspread with blushes\r\nand confusion, answered, in a stammering voice, “I am sure, madam, I\r\nshall always think the honour of your ladyship's company----” “I hope,\r\nat least,” cries Lady Bellaston, “I interrupt no business.”--“No,\r\nmadam,” answered Sophia, “our business was at an end. Your ladyship\r\nmay be pleased to remember I have often mentioned the loss of my\r\npocket-book, which this gentleman, having very luckily found, was so\r\nkind to return it to me with the bill in it.”\r\n\r\nJones, ever since the arrival of Lady Bellaston, had been ready to\r\nsink with fear. He sat kicking his heels, playing with his fingers,\r\nand looking more like a fool, if it be possible, than a young booby\r\nsquire, when he is first introduced into a polite assembly. He began,\r\nhowever, now to recover himself; and taking a hint from the behaviour\r\nof Lady Bellaston, who he saw did not intend to claim any acquaintance\r\nwith him, he resolved as entirely to affect the stranger on his part.\r\nHe said, “Ever since he had the pocket-book in his possession, he had\r\nused great diligence in enquiring out the lady whose name was writ in\r\nit; but never till that day could be so fortunate to discover her.”\r\n\r\nSophia had indeed mentioned the loss of her pocket-book to Lady\r\nBellaston; but as Jones, for some reason or other, had never once\r\nhinted to her that it was in his possession, she believed not one\r\nsyllable of what Sophia now said, and wonderfully admired the extreme\r\nquickness of the young lady in inventing such an excuse. The reason of\r\nSophia's leaving the playhouse met with no better credit; and though\r\nshe could not account for the meeting between these two lovers, she\r\nwas firmly persuaded it was not accidental.\r\n\r\nWith an affected smile, therefore, she said, “Indeed, Miss Western,\r\nyou have had very good luck in recovering your money. Not only as it\r\nfell into the hands of a gentleman of honour, but as he happened to\r\ndiscover to whom it belonged. I think you would not consent to have it\r\nadvertised.--It was great good fortune, sir, that you found out to\r\nwhom the note belonged.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, madam,” cries Jones, “it was enclosed in a pocket-book, in which\r\nthe young lady's name was written.”\r\n\r\n“That was very fortunate, indeed,” cries the lady:--“And it was no\r\nless so, that you heard Miss Western was at my house; for she is very\r\nlittle known.”\r\n\r\nJones had at length perfectly recovered his spirits; and as he\r\nconceived he had now an opportunity of satisfying Sophia as to the\r\nquestion she had asked him just before Lady Bellaston came in, he\r\nproceeded thus: “Why, madam,” answered he, “it was by the luckiest\r\nchance imaginable I made this discovery. I was mentioning what I had\r\nfound, and the name of the owner, the other night to a lady at the\r\nmasquerade, who told me she believed she knew where I might see Miss\r\nWestern; and if I would come to her house the next morning she would\r\ninform me, I went according to her appointment, but she was not at\r\nhome; nor could I ever meet with her till this morning, when she\r\ndirected me to your ladyship's house. I came accordingly, and did\r\nmyself the honour to ask for your ladyship; and upon my saying that I\r\nhad very particular business, a servant showed me into this room;\r\nwhere I had not been long before the young lady returned from the\r\nplay.”\r\n\r\nUpon his mentioning the masquerade, he looked very slily at Lady\r\nBellaston, without any fear of being remarked by Sophia; for she was\r\nvisibly too much confounded to make any observations. This hint a\r\nlittle alarmed the lady, and she was silent; when Jones, who saw the\r\nagitation of Sophia's mind, resolved to take the only method of\r\nrelieving her, which was by retiring; but, before he did this, he\r\nsaid, “I believe, madam, it is customary to give some reward on these\r\noccasions;--I must insist on a very high one for my honesty;--it is,\r\nmadam, no less than the honour of being permitted to pay another visit\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” replied the lady, “I make no doubt that you are a gentleman,\r\nand my doors are never shut to people of fashion.”\r\n\r\nJones then, after proper ceremonials, departed, highly to his own\r\nsatisfaction, and no less to that of Sophia; who was terribly alarmed\r\nlest Lady Bellaston should discover what she knew already but too\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nUpon the stairs Jones met his old acquaintance, Mrs Honour, who,\r\nnotwithstanding all she had said against him, was now so well bred to\r\nbehave with great civility. This meeting proved indeed a lucky\r\ncircumstance, as he communicated to her the house where he lodged,\r\nwith which Sophia was unacquainted."

      "content": "In which the thirteenth book is concluded.\r\n\nThe elegant Lord Shaftesbury somewhere objects to telling too much\r\ntruth: by which it may be fairly inferred, that, in some cases, to lie\r\nis not only excusable but commendable.\r\n\r\nAnd surely there are no persons who may so properly challenge a right\r\nto this commendable deviation from truth, as young women in the affair\r\nof love; for which they may plead precept, education, and above all,\r\nthe sanction, nay, I may say the necessity of custom, by which they\r\nare restrained, not from submitting to the honest impulses of nature\r\n(for that would be a foolish prohibition), but from owning them.\r\n\r\nWe are not, therefore, ashamed to say, that our heroine now pursued\r\nthe dictates of the above-mentioned right honourable philosopher. As\r\nshe was perfectly satisfied then, that Lady Bellaston was ignorant of\r\nthe person of Jones, so she determined to keep her in that ignorance,\r\nthough at the expense of a little fibbing.\r\n\r\nJones had not been long gone, before Lady Bellaston cryed, “Upon my\r\nword, a good pretty young fellow; I wonder who he is; for I don't\r\nremember ever to have seen his face before.”\r\n\r\n“Nor I neither, madam,” cries Sophia. “I must say he behaved very\r\nhandsomely in relation to my note.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; and he is a very handsome fellow,” said the lady: “don't you\r\nthink so?”\r\n\r\n“I did not take much notice of him,” answered Sophia, “but I thought\r\nhe seemed rather awkward, and ungenteel than otherwise.”\r\n\r\n“You are extremely right,” cries Lady Bellaston: “you may see, by his\r\nmanner, that he hath not kept good company. Nay, notwithstanding his\r\nreturning your note, and refusing the reward, I almost question\r\nwhether he is a gentleman.----I have always observed there is a\r\nsomething in persons well born, which others can never acquire.----I\r\nthink I will give orders not to be at home to him.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, sure, madam,” answered Sophia, “one can't suspect after what he\r\nhath done;--besides, if your ladyship observed him, there was an\r\nelegance in his discourse, a delicacy, a prettiness of expression\r\nthat, that----”\r\n\r\n“I confess,” said Lady Bellaston, “the fellow hath words----And\r\nindeed, Sophia, you must forgive me, indeed you must.”\r\n\r\n“I forgive your ladyship!” said Sophia.\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed you must,” answered she, laughing; “for I had a horrible\r\nsuspicion when I first came into the room----I vow you must forgive\r\nit; but I suspected it was Mr Jones himself.”\r\n\r\n“Did your ladyship, indeed?” cries Sophia, blushing, and affecting a\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I vow I did,” answered she. “I can't imagine what put it into my\r\nhead: for, give the fellow his due, he was genteely drest; which, I\r\nthink, dear Sophy, is not commonly the case with your friend.”\r\n\r\n“This raillery,” cries Sophia, “is a little cruel, Lady Bellaston,\r\nafter my promise to your ladyship.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all, child,” said the lady;----“It would have been cruel\r\nbefore; but after you have promised me never to marry without your\r\nfather's consent, in which you know is implied your giving up Jones,\r\nsure you can bear a little raillery on a passion which was pardonable\r\nenough in a young girl in the country, and of which you tell me you\r\nhave so entirely got the better. What must I think, my dear Sophy, if\r\nyou cannot bear a little ridicule even on his dress? I shall begin to\r\nfear you are very far gone indeed; and almost question whether you\r\nhave dealt ingenuously with me.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, madam,” cries Sophia, “your ladyship mistakes me, if you\r\nimagine I had any concern on his account.”\r\n\r\n“On his account!” answered the lady: “You must have mistaken me; I\r\nwent no farther than his dress;----for I would not injure your taste\r\nby any other comparison--I don't imagine, my dear Sophy, if your Mr\r\nJones had been such a fellow as this--”\r\n\r\n“I thought,” says Sophia, “your ladyship had allowed him to be\r\nhandsome”----\r\n\r\n“Whom, pray?” cried the lady hastily.\r\n\r\n“Mr Jones,” answered Sophia;--and immediately recollecting herself,\r\n“Mr Jones!--no, no; I ask your pardon;--I mean the gentleman who was\r\njust now here.”\r\n\r\n“O Sophy! Sophy!” cries the lady; “this Mr Jones, I am afraid, still\r\nruns in your head.”\r\n\r\n“Then, upon my honour, madam,” said Sophia, “Mr Jones is as entirely\r\nindifferent to me, as the gentleman who just now left us.”\r\n\r\n“Upon my honour,” said Lady Bellaston, “I believe it. Forgive me,\r\ntherefore, a little innocent raillery; but I promise you I will never\r\nmention his name any more.”\r\n\r\nAnd now the two ladies separated, infinitely more to the delight of\r\nSophia than of Lady Bellaston, who would willingly have tormented her\r\nrival a little longer, had not business of more importance called her\r\naway. As for Sophia, her mind was not perfectly easy under this first\r\npractice of deceit; upon which, when she retired to her chamber, she\r\nreflected with the highest uneasiness and conscious shame. Nor could\r\nthe peculiar hardship of her situation, and the necessity of the case,\r\nat all reconcile her mind to her conduct; for the frame of her mind\r\nwas too delicate to bear the thought of having been guilty of a\r\nfalsehood, however qualified by circumstances. Nor did this thought\r\nonce suffer her to close her eyes during the whole succeeding night.\r\n\nBOOK XIV.\r\n\r\nCONTAINING TWO DAYS."

      "content": "An essay to prove that an author will write the better for having some\r\nknowledge of the subject on which he writes.\r\n\nAs several gentlemen in these times, by the wonderful force of genius\r\nonly, without the least assistance of learning, perhaps, without being\r\nwell able to read, have made a considerable figure in the republic of\r\nletters; the modern critics, I am told, have lately begun to assert,\r\nthat all kind of learning is entirely useless to a writer; and,\r\nindeed, no other than a kind of fetters on the natural sprightliness\r\nand activity of the imagination, which is thus weighed down, and\r\nprevented from soaring to those high flights which otherwise it would\r\nbe able to reach.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine, I am afraid, is at present carried much too far: for\r\nwhy should writing differ so much from all other arts? The nimbleness\r\nof a dancing-master is not at all prejudiced by being taught to move;\r\nnor doth any mechanic, I believe, exercise his tools the worse by\r\nhaving learnt to use them. For my own part, I cannot conceive that\r\nHomer or Virgil would have writ with more fire, if instead of being\r\nmasters of all the learning of their times, they had been as ignorant\r\nas most of the authors of the present age. Nor do I believe that all\r\nthe imagination, fire, and judgment of Pitt, could have produced those\r\norations that have made the senate of England, in these our times, a\r\nrival in eloquence to Greece and Rome, if he had not been so well read\r\nin the writings of Demosthenes and Cicero, as to have transferred\r\ntheir whole spirit into his speeches, and, with their spirit, their\r\nknowledge too.\r\n\r\nI would not here be understood to insist on the same fund of learning\r\nin any of my brethren, as Cicero persuades us is necessary to the\r\ncomposition of an orator. On the contrary, very little reading is, I\r\nconceive, necessary to the poet, less to the critic, and the least of\r\nall to the politician. For the first, perhaps, Byshe's Art of Poetry,\r\nand a few of our modern poets, may suffice; for the second, a moderate\r\nheap of plays; and, for the last, an indifferent collection of\r\npolitical journals.\r\n\r\nTo say the truth, I require no more than that a man should have some\r\nlittle knowledge of the subject on which he treats, according to the\r\nold maxim of law, _Quam quisque nôrit artem in eâ se exerceat_. With\r\nthis alone a writer may sometimes do tolerably well; and, indeed,\r\nwithout this, all the other learning in the world will stand him in\r\nlittle stead.\r\n\r\nFor instance, let us suppose that Homer and Virgil, Aristotle and\r\nCicero, Thucydides and Livy, could have met all together, and have\r\nclubbed their several talents to have composed a treatise on the art\r\nof dancing: I believe it will be readily agreed they could not have\r\nequalled the excellent treatise which Mr Essex hath given us on that\r\nsubject, entitled, The Rudiments of Genteel Education. And, indeed,\r\nshould the excellent Mr Broughton be prevailed on to set fist to\r\npaper, and to complete the above-said rudiments, by delivering down\r\nthe true principles of athletics, I question whether the world will\r\nhave any cause to lament, that none of the great writers, either\r\nantient or modern, have ever treated about that noble and useful art.\r\n\r\nTo avoid a multiplicity of examples in so plain a case, and to come at\r\nonce to my point, I am apt to conceive, that one reason why many\r\nEnglish writers have totally failed in describing the manners of upper\r\nlife, may possibly be, that in reality they know nothing of it.\r\n\r\nThis is a knowledge unhappily not in the power of many authors to\r\narrive at. Books will give us a very imperfect idea of it; nor will\r\nthe stage a much better: the fine gentleman formed upon reading the\r\nformer will almost always turn out a pedant, and he who forms himself\r\nupon the latter, a coxcomb.\r\n\r\nNor are the characters drawn from these models better supported.\r\nVanbrugh and Congreve copied nature; but they who copy them draw as\r\nunlike the present age as Hogarth would do if he was to paint a rout\r\nor a drum in the dresses of Titian and of Vandyke. In short, imitation\r\nhere will not do the business. The picture must be after Nature\r\nherself. A true knowledge of the world is gained only by conversation,\r\nand the manners of every rank must be seen in order to be known.\r\n\r\nNow it happens that this higher order of mortals is not to be seen,\r\nlike all the rest of the human species, for nothing, in the streets,\r\nshops, and coffee-houses; nor are they shown, like the upper rank of\r\nanimals, for so much a-piece. In short, this is a sight to which no\r\npersons are admitted without one or other of these qualifications,\r\nviz., either birth or fortune, or, what is equivalent to both, the\r\nhonourable profession of a gamester. And, very unluckily for the\r\nworld, persons so qualified very seldom care to take upon themselves\r\nthe bad trade of writing; which is generally entered upon by the lower\r\nand poorer sort, as it is a trade which many think requires no kind of\r\nstock to set up with.\r\n\r\nHence those strange monsters in lace and embroidery, in silks and\r\nbrocades, with vast wigs and hoops; which, under the name of lords and\r\nladies, strut the stage, to the great delight of attorneys and their\r\nclerks in the pit, and of the citizens and their apprentices in the\r\ngalleries; and which are no more to be found in real life than the\r\ncentaur, the chimera, or any other creature of mere fiction. But to\r\nlet my reader into a secret, this knowledge of upper life, though very\r\nnecessary for preventing mistakes, is no very great resource to a\r\nwriter whose province is comedy, or that kind of novels which, like\r\nthis I am writing, is of the comic class.\r\n\r\nWhat Mr Pope says of women is very applicable to most in this station,\r\nwho are, indeed, so entirely made up of form and affectation, that\r\nthey have no character at all, at least none which appears. I will\r\nventure to say the highest life is much the dullest, and affords very\r\nlittle humour or entertainment. The various callings in lower spheres\r\nproduce the great variety of humorous characters; whereas here, except\r\namong the few who are engaged in the pursuit of ambition, and the\r\nfewer still who have a relish for pleasure, all is vanity and servile\r\nimitation. Dressing and cards, eating and drinking, bowing and\r\ncourtesying, make up the business of their lives.\r\n\r\nSome there are, however, of this rank upon whom passion exercises its\r\ntyranny, and hurries them far beyond the bounds which decorum\r\nprescribes; of these the ladies are as much distinguished by their\r\nnoble intrepidity, and a certain superior contempt of reputation, from\r\nthe frail ones of meaner degree, as a virtuous woman of quality is by\r\nthe elegance and delicacy of her sentiments from the honest wife of a\r\nyeoman and shopkeeper. Lady Bellaston was of this intrepid character;\r\nbut let not my country readers conclude from her, that this is the\r\ngeneral conduct of women of fashion, or that we mean to represent them\r\nas such. They might as well suppose that every clergyman was\r\nrepresented by Thwackum, or every soldier by ensign Northerton.\r\n\r\nThere is not, indeed, a greater error than that which universally\r\nprevails among the vulgar, who, borrowing their opinion from some\r\nignorant satirists, have affixed the character of lewdness to these\r\ntimes. On the contrary, I am convinced there never was less of love\r\nintrigue carried on among persons of condition than now. Our present\r\nwomen have been taught by their mothers to fix their thoughts only on\r\nambition and vanity, and to despise the pleasures of love as unworthy\r\ntheir regard; and being afterwards, by the care of such mothers,\r\nmarried without having husbands, they seem pretty well confirmed in\r\nthe justness of those sentiments; whence they content themselves, for\r\nthe dull remainder of life, with the pursuit of more innocent, but I\r\nam afraid more childish amusements, the bare mention of which would\r\nill suit with the dignity of this history. In my humble opinion, the\r\ntrue characteristic of the present beau monde is rather folly than\r\nvice, and the only epithet which it deserves is that of frivolous."

      "content": "Containing letters and other matters which attend amours.\r\n\nJones had not been long at home before he received the following\r\nletter:--\r\n\r\n “I was never more surprized than when I found you was gone. When you\r\n left the room I little imagined you intended to have left the house\r\n without seeing me again. Your behaviour is all of a piece, and\r\n convinces me how much I ought to despise a heart which can doat upon\r\n an idiot; though I know not whether I should not admire her cunning\r\n more than her simplicity: wonderful both! For though she understood\r\n not a word of what passed between us, yet she had the skill, the\r\n assurance, the----what shall I call it? to deny to my face that she\r\n knows you, or ever saw you before.----Was this a scheme laid between\r\n you, and have you been base enough to betray me?----O how I despise\r\n her, you, and all the world, but chiefly myself! for----I dare not\r\n write what I should afterwards run mad to read; but remember, I can\r\n detest as violently as I have loved.”\r\n\r\nJones had but little time given him to reflect on this letter, before\r\na second was brought him from the same hand; and this, likewise, we\r\nshall set down in the precise words.\r\n\r\n “When you consider the hurry of spirits in which I must have writ,\r\n you cannot be surprized at any expressions in my former note.--Yet,\r\n perhaps, on reflection, they were rather too warm. At least I would,\r\n if possible, think all owing to the odious playhouse, and to the\r\n impertinence of a fool, which detained me beyond my\r\n appointment.----How easy is it to think well of those we\r\n love!----Perhaps you desire I should think so. I have resolved to\r\n see you to-night; so come to me immediately.\r\n\r\n “_P.S._--I have ordered to be at home to none but yourself.\r\n\r\n “_P.S._--Mr Jones will imagine I shall assist him in his defence;\r\n for I believe he cannot desire to impose on me more than I desire to\r\n impose on myself.\r\n\r\n “_P.S._--Come immediately.”\r\n\r\nTo the men of intrigue I refer the determination, whether the angry or\r\nthe tender letter gave the greatest uneasiness to Jones. Certain it\r\nis, he had no violent inclination to pay any more visits that evening,\r\nunless to one single person. However, he thought his honour engaged,\r\nand had not this been motive sufficient, he would not have ventured to\r\nblow the temper of Lady Bellaston into that flame of which he had\r\nreason to think it susceptible, and of which he feared the consequence\r\nmight be a discovery to Sophia, which he dreaded. After some\r\ndiscontented walks therefore about the room, he was preparing to\r\ndepart, when the lady kindly prevented him, not by another letter, but\r\nby her own presence. She entered the room very disordered in her\r\ndress, and very discomposed in her looks, and threw herself into a\r\nchair, where, having recovered her breath, she said--“You see, sir,\r\nwhen women have gone one length too far, they will stop at none. If\r\nany person would have sworn this to me a week ago, I would not have\r\nbelieved it of myself.” “I hope, madam,” said Jones, “my charming Lady\r\nBellaston will be as difficult to believe anything against one who is\r\nso sensible of the many obligations she hath conferred upon him.”\r\n “Indeed!” says she, “sensible of obligations! Did I expect to hear\r\nsuch cold language from Mr Jones?” “Pardon me, my dear angel,” said\r\nhe, “if, after the letters I have received, the terrors of your anger,\r\nthough I know not how I have deserved it.”--“And have I then,” says\r\nshe, with a smile, “so angry a countenance?--Have I really brought a\r\nchiding face with me?”--“If there be honour in man,” said he, “I have\r\ndone nothing to merit your anger.--You remember the appointment you\r\nsent me; I went in pursuance.”--“I beseech you,” cried she, “do not\r\nrun through the odious recital.--Answer me but one question, and I\r\nshall be easy. Have you not betrayed my honour to her?”--Jones fell\r\nupon his knees, and began to utter the most violent protestations,\r\nwhen Partridge came dancing and capering into the room, like one drunk\r\nwith joy, crying out, “She's found! she's found!--Here, sir, here,\r\nshe's here--Mrs Honour is upon the stairs.” “Stop her a moment,” cries\r\nJones--“Here, madam, step behind the bed, I have no other room nor\r\ncloset, nor place on earth to hide you in; sure never was so damned an\r\naccident.”--“D--n'd indeed!” said the lady, as she went to her place\r\nof concealment; and presently afterwards in came Mrs Honour.\r\n“Hey-day!” says she, “Mr Jones, what's the matter?--That impudent\r\nrascal your servant would scarce let me come upstairs. I hope he hath\r\nnot the same reason to keep me from you as he had at Upton.--I suppose\r\nyou hardly expected to see me; but you have certainly bewitched my\r\nlady. Poor dear young lady! To be sure, I loves her as tenderly as if\r\nshe was my own sister. Lord have mercy upon you, if you don't make her\r\na good husband! and to be sure, if you do not, nothing can be bad\r\nenough for you.” Jones begged her only to whisper, for that there was\r\na lady dying in the next room. “A lady!” cries she; “ay, I suppose one\r\nof your ladies.--O Mr Jones, there are too many of them in the world;\r\nI believe we are got into the house of one, for my Lady Bellaston I\r\ndarst to say is no better than she should be.”--“Hush! hush!” cries\r\nJones, “every word is overheard in the next room.” “I don't care a\r\nfarthing,” cries Honour, “I speaks no scandal of any one; but to be\r\nsure the servants make no scruple of saying as how her ladyship meets\r\nmen at another place--where the house goes under the name of a poor\r\ngentlewoman; but her ladyship pays the rent, and many's the good thing\r\nbesides, they say, she hath of her.”--Here Jones, after expressing the\r\nutmost uneasiness, offered to stop her mouth:--“Hey-day! why sure, Mr\r\nJones, you will let me speak; I speaks no scandal, for I only says\r\nwhat I heard from others--and thinks I to myself, much good may it do\r\nthe gentlewoman with her riches, if she comes by it in such a wicked\r\nmanner. To be sure it is better to be poor and honest.” “The servants\r\nare villains,” cries Jones, “and abuse their lady unjustly.”--“Ay, to\r\nbe sure, servants are always villains, and so my lady says, and won't\r\nhear a word of it.”--“No, I am convinced,” says Jones, “my Sophia is\r\nabove listening to such base scandal.” “Nay, I believe it is no\r\nscandal, neither,” cries Honour, “for why should she meet men at\r\nanother house?--It can never be for any good: for if she had a lawful\r\ndesign of being courted, as to be sure any lady may lawfully give her\r\ncompany to men upon that account: why, where can be the sense?”--“I\r\nprotest,” cries Jones, “I can't hear all this of a lady of such\r\nhonour, and a relation of Sophia; besides, you will distract the poor\r\nlady in the next room.--Let me entreat you to walk with me down\r\nstairs.”--“Nay, sir, if you won't let me speak, I have done.--Here,\r\nsir, is a letter from my young lady--what would some men give to have\r\nthis? But, Mr Jones, I think you are not over and above generous, and\r\nyet I have heard some servants say----but I am sure you will do me the\r\njustice to own I never saw the colour of your money.” Here Jones\r\nhastily took the letter, and presently after slipped five pieces into\r\nher hand. He then returned a thousand thanks to his dear Sophia in a\r\nwhisper, and begged her to leave him to read her letter: she presently\r\ndeparted, not without expressing much grateful sense of his\r\ngenerosity.\r\n\r\nLady Bellaston now came from behind the curtain. How shall I describe\r\nher rage? Her tongue was at first incapable of utterance; but streams\r\nof fire darted from her eyes, and well indeed they might, for her\r\nheart was all in a flame. And now as soon as her voice found way,\r\ninstead of expressing any indignation against Honour or her own\r\nservants, she began to attack poor Jones. “You see,” said she, “what I\r\nhave sacrificed to you; my reputation, my honour--gone for ever! And\r\nwhat return have I found? Neglected, slighted for a country girl, for\r\nan idiot.”--“What neglect, madam, or what slight,” cries Jones, “have\r\nI been guilty of?”--“Mr Jones,” said she, “it is in vain to dissemble;\r\nif you will make me easy, you must entirely give her up; and as a\r\nproof of your intention, show me the letter.”--“What letter, madam?”\r\n said Jones. “Nay, surely,” said she, “you cannot have the confidence\r\nto deny your having received a letter by the hands of that\r\ntrollop.”--“And can your ladyship,” cries he, “ask of me what I must\r\npart with my honour before I grant? Have I acted in such a manner by\r\nyour ladyship? Could I be guilty of betraying this poor innocent girl\r\nto you, what security could you have that I should not act the same\r\npart by yourself? A moment's reflection will, I am sure, convince you\r\nthat a man with whom the secrets of a lady are not safe must be the\r\nmost contemptible of wretches.”--“Very well,” said she--“I need not\r\ninsist on your becoming this contemptible wretch in your own opinion;\r\nfor the inside of the letter could inform me of nothing more than I\r\nknow already. I see the footing you are upon.”--Here ensued a long\r\nconversation, which the reader, who is not too curious, will thank me\r\nfor not inserting at length. It shall suffice, therefore, to inform\r\nhim, that Lady Bellaston grew more and more pacified, and at length\r\nbelieved, or affected to believe, his protestations, that his meeting\r\nwith Sophia that evening was merely accidental, and every other matter\r\nwhich the reader already knows, and which, as Jones set before her in\r\nthe strongest light, it is plain that she had in reality no reason to\r\nbe angry with him.\r\n\r\nShe was not, however, in her heart perfectly satisfied with his\r\nrefusal to show her the letter; so deaf are we to the clearest reason,\r\nwhen it argues against our prevailing passions. She was, indeed, well\r\nconvinced that Sophia possessed the first place in Jones's affections;\r\nand yet, haughty and amorous as this lady was, she submitted at last\r\nto bear the second place; or, to express it more properly in a legal\r\nphrase, was contented with the possession of that of which another\r\nwoman had the reversion.\r\n\r\nIt was at length agreed that Jones should for the future visit at the\r\nhouse: for that Sophia, her maid, and all the servants, would place\r\nthese visits to the account of Sophia; and that she herself would be\r\nconsidered as the person imposed upon.\r\n\r\nThis scheme was contrived by the lady, and highly relished by Jones,\r\nwho was indeed glad to have a prospect of seeing his Sophia at any\r\nrate; and the lady herself was not a little pleased with the\r\nimposition on Sophia, which Jones, she thought, could not possibly\r\ndiscover to her for his own sake.\r\n\r\nThe next day was appointed for the first visit, and then, after proper\r\nceremonials, the Lady Bellaston returned home."

      "content": "Containing various matters.\r\n\nJones was no sooner alone than he eagerly broke open his letter, and\r\nread as follows:--\r\n\r\n “Sir, it is impossible to express what I have suffered since you\r\n left this house; and as I have reason to think you intend coming\r\n here again, I have sent Honour, though so late at night, as she\r\n tells me she knows your lodgings, to prevent you. I charge you, by\r\n all the regard you have for me, not to think of visiting here; for\r\n it will certainly be discovered; nay, I almost doubt, from some\r\n things which have dropt from her ladyship, that she is not already\r\n without some suspicion. Something favourable perhaps may happen; we\r\n must wait with patience; but I once more entreat you, if you have\r\n any concern for my ease, do not think of returning hither.”\r\n\r\nThis letter administered the same kind of consolation to poor Jones,\r\nwhich Job formerly received from his friends. Besides disappointing\r\nall the hopes which he promised to himself from seeing Sophia, he was\r\nreduced to an unhappy dilemma, with regard to Lady Bellaston; for\r\nthere are some certain engagements, which, as he well knew, do very\r\ndifficultly admit of any excuse for the failure; and to go, after the\r\nstrict prohibition from Sophia, he was not to be forced by any human\r\npower. At length, after much deliberation, which during that night\r\nsupplied the place of sleep, he determined to feign himself sick: for\r\nthis suggested itself as the only means of failing the appointed\r\nvisit, without incensing Lady Bellaston, which he had more than one\r\nreason of desiring to avoid.\r\n\r\nThe first thing, however, which he did in the morning, was, to write\r\nan answer to Sophia, which he inclosed in one to Honour. He then\r\ndespatched another to Lady Bellaston, containing the above-mentioned\r\nexcuse; and to this he soon received the following answer:--\r\n\r\n “I am vexed that I cannot see you here this afternoon, but more\r\n concerned for the occasion; take great care of yourself, and have\r\n the best advice, and I hope there will be no danger.--I am so\r\n tormented all this morning with fools, that I have scarce a moment's\r\n time to write to you. Adieu.\r\n\r\n “_P.S._--I will endeavour to call on you this evening, at nine.--Be\r\n sure to be alone.”\r\n\r\nMr Jones now received a visit from Mrs Miller, who, after some formal\r\nintroduction, began the following speech:--“I am very sorry, sir, to\r\nwait upon you on such an occasion; but I hope you will consider the\r\nill consequence which it must be to the reputation of my poor girls,\r\nif my house should once be talked of as a house of ill-fame. I hope\r\nyou won't think me, therefore, guilty of impertinence, if I beg you\r\nnot to bring any more ladies in at that time of night. The clock had\r\nstruck two before one of them went away.”--“I do assure you, madam,”\r\n said Jones, “the lady who was here last night, and who staid the\r\nlatest (for the other only brought me a letter), is a woman of very\r\ngreat fashion, and my near relation.”--“I don't know what fashion she\r\nis of,” answered Mrs Miller; “but I am sure no woman of virtue, unless\r\na very near relation indeed, would visit a young gentleman at ten at\r\nnight, and stay four hours in his room with him alone; besides, sir,\r\nthe behaviour of her chairmen shows what she was; for they did nothing\r\nbut make jests all the evening in the entry, and asked Mr Partridge,\r\nin the hearing of my own maid, if madam intended to stay with his\r\nmaster all night; with a great deal of stuff not proper to be\r\nrepeated. I have really a great respect for you, Mr Jones, upon your\r\nown account; nay, I have a very high obligation to you for your\r\ngenerosity to my cousin. Indeed, I did not know how very good you had\r\nbeen till lately. Little did I imagine to what dreadful courses the\r\npoor man's distress had driven him. Little did I think, when you gave\r\nme the ten guineas, that you had given them to a highwayman! O\r\nheavens! what goodness have you shown! How have you preserved this\r\nfamily!--The character which Mr Allworthy hath formerly given me of\r\nyou was, I find, strictly true.--And indeed, if I had no obligation to\r\nyou, my obligations to him are such, that, on his account, I should\r\nshew you the utmost respect in my power.--Nay, believe me, dear Mr\r\nJones, if my daughters' and my own reputation were out of the case, I\r\nshould, for your own sake, be sorry that so pretty a young gentleman\r\nshould converse with these women; but if you are resolved to do it, I\r\nmust beg you to take another lodging; for I do not myself like to have\r\nsuch things carried on under my roof; but more especially upon the\r\naccount of my girls, who have little, heaven knows, besides their\r\ncharacters, to recommend them.” Jones started and changed colour at\r\nthe name of Allworthy. “Indeed, Mrs Miller,” answered he, a little\r\nwarmly, “I do not take this at all kind. I will never bring any\r\nslander on your house; but I must insist on seeing what company I\r\nplease in my own room; and if that gives you any offence, I shall, as\r\nsoon as I am able, look for another lodging.”--“I am sorry we must\r\npart then, sir,” said she; “but I am convinced Mr Allworthy himself\r\nwould never come within my doors, if he had the least suspicion of my\r\nkeeping an ill house.”--“Very well, madam,” said Jones.--“I hope,\r\nsir,” said she, “you are not angry; for I would not for the world\r\noffend any of Mr Allworthy's family. I have not slept a wink all night\r\nabout this matter.”--“I am sorry I have disturbed your rest, madam,”\r\n said Jones, “but I beg you will send Partridge up to me immediately;”\r\n which she promised to do, and then with a very low courtesy retired.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Partridge arrived, Jones fell upon him in the most\r\noutrageous manner. “How often,” said he, “am I to suffer for your\r\nfolly, or rather for my own in keeping you? is that tongue of yours\r\nresolved upon my destruction?” “What have I done, sir?” answered\r\naffrighted Partridge. “Who was it gave you authority to mention the\r\nstory of the robbery, or that the man you saw here was the person?”\r\n “I, sir?” cries Partridge. “Now don't be guilty of a falsehood in\r\ndenying it,” said Jones. “If I did mention such a matter,” answers\r\nPartridge, “I am sure I thought no harm; for I should not have opened\r\nmy lips, if it had not been to his own friends and relations, who, I\r\nimagined, would have let it go no farther.” “But I have a much heavier\r\ncharge against you,” cries Jones, “than this. How durst you, after all\r\nthe precautions I gave you, mention the name of Mr Allworthy in this\r\nhouse?” Partridge denied that he ever had, with many oaths. “How\r\nelse,” said Jones, “should Mrs Miller be acquainted that there was any\r\nconnexion between him and me? And it is but this moment she told me\r\nshe respected me on his account.” “O Lord, sir,” said Partridge, “I\r\ndesire only to be heard out; and to be sure, never was anything so\r\nunfortunate: hear me but out, and you will own how wrongfully you have\r\naccused me. When Mrs Honour came downstairs last night she met me in\r\nthe entry, and asked me when my master had heard from Mr Allworthy;\r\nand to be sure Mrs Miller heard the very words; and the moment Madam\r\nHonour was gone, she called me into the parlour to her. `Mr\r\nPartridge,' says she, `what Mr Allworthy is it that the gentlewoman\r\nmentioned? is it the great Mr Allworthy of Somersetshire?' `Upon my\r\nword, madam,' says I, `I know nothing of the matter.' `Sure,' says\r\nshe, `your master is not the Mr Jones I have heard Mr Allworthy talk\r\nof?' `Upon my word, madam,' says I, `I know nothing of the matter.'\r\n`Then,' says she, turning to her daughter Nancy, says she, `as sure as\r\ntenpence this is the very young gentleman, and he agrees exactly with\r\nthe squire's description.' The Lord above knows who it was told her:\r\nfor I am the arrantest villain that ever walked upon two legs if ever\r\nit came out of my mouth. I promise you, sir, I can keep a secret when\r\nI am desired. Nay, sir, so far was I from telling her anything about\r\nMr Allworthy, that I told her the very direct contrary; for, though I\r\ndid not contradict it at that moment, yet, as second thoughts, they\r\nsay, are best, so when I came to consider that somebody must have\r\ninformed her, thinks I to myself, I will put an end to the story; and\r\nso I went back again into the parlour some time afterwards, and says\r\nI, upon my word, says I, whoever, says I, told you that this gentleman\r\nwas Mr Jones; that is, says I, that this Mr Jones was that Mr Jones,\r\ntold you a confounded lie: and I beg, says I, you will never mention\r\nany such matter, says I; for my master, says I, will think I must have\r\ntold you so; and I defy anybody in the house ever to say I mentioned\r\nany such word. To be certain, sir, it is a wonderful thing, and I have\r\nbeen thinking with myself ever since, how it was she came to know it;\r\nnot but I saw an old woman here t'other day a begging at the door, who\r\nlooked as like her we saw in Warwickshire, that caused all that\r\nmischief to us. To be sure it is never good to pass by an old woman\r\nwithout giving her something, especially if she looks at you; for all\r\nthe world shall never persuade me but that they have a great power to\r\ndo mischief, and to be sure I shall never see an old woman again, but\r\nI shall think to myself, _Infandum, regina, jubes renovare dolorem._”\r\n\r\nThe simplicity of Partridge set Jones a laughing, and put a final end\r\nto his anger, which had indeed seldom any long duration in his mind;\r\nand, instead of commenting on his defence, he told him he intended\r\npresently to leave those lodgings, and ordered him to go and endeavour\r\nto get him others."

      "content": "Which we hope will be very attentively perused by young people of both\r\nsexes.\r\n\nPartridge had no sooner left Mr Jones than Mr Nightingale, with whom\r\nhe had now contracted a great intimacy, came to him, and, after a\r\nshort salutation, said, “So, Tom, I hear you had company very late\r\nlast night. Upon my soul you are a happy fellow, who have not been in\r\ntown above a fortnight, and can keep chairs waiting at your door till\r\ntwo in the morning.” He then ran on with much commonplace raillery of\r\nthe same kind, till Jones at last interrupted him, saying, “I suppose\r\nyou have received all this information from Mrs Miller, who hath been\r\nup here a little while ago to give me warning. The good woman is\r\nafraid, it seems, of the reputation of her daughters.” “Oh! she is\r\nwonderfully nice,” says Nightingale, “upon that account; if you\r\nremember, she would not let Nancy go with us to the masquerade.” “Nay,\r\nupon my honour, I think she's in the right of it,” says Jones:\r\n“however, I have taken her at her word, and have sent Partridge to\r\nlook for another lodging.” “If you will,” says Nightingale, “we may, I\r\nbelieve, be again together; for, to tell you a secret, which I desire\r\nyou won't mention in the family, I intend to quit the house to-day.”\r\n “What, hath Mrs Miller given you warning too, my friend?” cries Jones.\r\n“No,” answered the other; “but the rooms are not convenient enough.\r\nBesides, I am grown weary of this part of the town. I want to be\r\nnearer the places of diversion; so I am going to Pall-mall.” “And do\r\nyou intend to make a secret of your going away?” said Jones. “I\r\npromise you,” answered Nightingale, “I don't intend to bilk my\r\nlodgings; but I have a private reason for not taking a formal leave.”\r\n “Not so private,” answered Jones; “I promise you, I have seen it ever\r\nsince the second day of my coming to the house. Here will be some wet\r\neyes on your departure. Poor Nancy, I pity her, faith! Indeed, Jack,\r\nyou have played the fool with that girl. You have given her a longing,\r\nwhich I am afraid nothing will ever cure her of.” Nightingale\r\nanswered, “What the devil would you have me do? would you have me\r\nmarry her to cure her?” “No,” answered Jones, “I would not have had\r\nyou make love to her, as you have often done in my presence. I have\r\nbeen astonished at the blindness of her mother in never seeing it.”\r\n “Pugh, see it!” cries Nightingale. “What, the devil should she see?”\r\n “Why, see,” said Jones, “that you have made her daughter distractedly\r\nin love with you. The poor girl cannot conceal it a moment; her eyes\r\nare never off from you, and she always colours every time you come\r\ninto the room. Indeed, I pity her heartily; for she seems to be one of\r\nthe best-natured and honestest of human creatures.” “And so,” answered\r\nNightingale, “according to your doctrine, one must not amuse oneself\r\nby any common gallantries with women, for fear they should fall in\r\nlove with us.” “Indeed, Jack,” said Jones, “you wilfully misunderstand\r\nme; I do not fancy women are so apt to fall in love; but you have gone\r\nfar beyond common gallantries.” “What, do you suppose,” says\r\nNightingale, “that we have been a-bed together?” “No, upon my honour,”\r\n answered Jones, very seriously, “I do not suppose so ill of you; nay,\r\nI will go farther, I do not imagine you have laid a regular\r\npremeditated scheme for the destruction of the quiet of a poor little\r\ncreature, or have even foreseen the consequence: for I am sure thou\r\nart a very good-natured fellow; and such a one can never be guilty of\r\na cruelty of that kind; but at the same time you have pleased your own\r\nvanity, without considering that this poor girl was made a sacrifice\r\nto it; and while you have had no design but of amusing an idle hour,\r\nyou have actually given her reason to flatter herself that you had the\r\nmost serious designs in her favour. Prithee, Jack, answer me honestly;\r\nto what have tended all those elegant and luscious descriptions of\r\nhappiness arising from violent and mutual fondness? all those warm\r\nprofessions of tenderness, and generous disinterested love? Did you\r\nimagine she would not apply them? or, speak ingenuously, did not you\r\nintend she should?” “Upon my soul, Tom,” cries Nightingale, “I did not\r\nthink this was in thee. Thou wilt make an admirable parson. So I\r\nsuppose you would not go to bed to Nancy now, if she would let you?”\r\n “No,” cries Jones, “may I be d--n'd if I would.” “Tom, Tom,” answered\r\nNightingale, “last night; remember last night----\r\n\r\n When every eye was closed, and the pale moon,\r\n And silent stars, shone conscious of the theft.”\r\n\r\n“Lookee, Mr Nightingale,” said Jones, “I am no canting hypocrite, nor\r\ndo I pretend to the gift of chastity, more than my neighbours. I have\r\nbeen guilty with women, I own it; but am not conscious that I have\r\never injured any.--Nor would I, to procure pleasure to myself, be\r\nknowingly the cause of misery to any human being.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” said Nightingale, “I believe you, and I am convinced you\r\nacquit me of any such thing.”\r\n\r\n“I do, from my heart,” answered Jones, “of having debauched the girl,\r\nbut not from having gained her affections.”\r\n\r\n“If I have,” said Nightingale, “I am sorry for it; but time and\r\nabsence will soon wear off such impressions. It is a receipt I must\r\ntake myself; for, to confess the truth to you--I never liked any girl\r\nhalf so much in my whole life; but I must let you into the whole\r\nsecret, Tom. My father hath provided a match for me with a woman I\r\nnever saw; and she is now coming to town, in order for me to make my\r\naddresses to her.”\r\n\r\nAt these words Jones burst into a loud fit of laughter; when\r\nNightingale cried--“Nay, prithee, don't turn me into ridicule. The\r\ndevil take me if I am not half mad about this matter! my poor Nancy!\r\nOh! Jones, Jones, I wish I had a fortune in my own possession.”\r\n\r\n“I heartily wish you had,” cries Jones; “for, if this be the case, I\r\nsincerely pity you both; but surely you don't intend to go away\r\nwithout taking your leave of her?”\r\n\r\n“I would not,” answered Nightingale, “undergo the pain of taking\r\nleave, for ten thousand pounds; besides, I am convinced, instead of\r\nanswering any good purpose, it would only serve to inflame my poor\r\nNancy the more. I beg, therefore, you would not mention a word of it\r\nto-day, and in the evening, or to-morrow morning, I intend to depart.”\r\n\r\nJones promised he would not; and said, upon reflection, he thought, as\r\nhe had determined and was obliged to leave her, he took the most\r\nprudent method. He then told Nightingale he should be very glad to\r\nlodge in the same house with him; and it was accordingly agreed\r\nbetween them, that Nightingale should procure him either the ground\r\nfloor, or the two pair of stairs; for the young gentleman himself was\r\nto occupy that which was between them.\r\n\r\nThis Nightingale, of whom we shall be presently obliged to say a\r\nlittle more, was in the ordinary transactions of life a man of strict\r\nhonour, and, what is more rare among young gentlemen of the town, one\r\nof strict honesty too; yet in affairs of love he was somewhat loose in\r\nhis morals; not that he was even here as void of principle as\r\ngentlemen sometimes are, and oftener affect to be; but it is certain\r\nhe had been guilty of some indefensible treachery to women, and had,\r\nin a certain mystery, called making love, practised many deceits,\r\nwhich, if he had used in trade, he would have been counted the\r\ngreatest villain upon earth.\r\n\r\nBut as the world, I know not well for what reason, agree to see this\r\ntreachery in a better light, he was so far from being ashamed of his\r\niniquities of this kind, that he gloried in them, and would often\r\nboast of his skill in gaining of women, and his triumphs over their\r\nhearts, for which he had before this time received some rebukes from\r\nJones, who always exprest great bitterness against any misbehaviour to\r\nthe fair part of the species, who, if considered, he said, as they\r\nought to be, in the light of the dearest friends, were to be\r\ncultivated, honoured, and caressed with the utmost love and\r\ntenderness; but, if regarded as enemies, were a conquest of which a\r\nman ought rather to be ashamed than to value himself upon it."

      "content": "A short account of the history of Mrs Miller.\r\n\nJones this day eat a pretty good dinner for a sick man, that is to\r\nsay, the larger half of a shoulder of mutton. In the afternoon he\r\nreceived an invitation from Mrs Miller to drink tea; for that good\r\nwoman, having learnt, either by means of Partridge, or by some other\r\nmeans natural or supernatural, that he had a connexion with Mr\r\nAllworthy, could not endure the thoughts of parting with him in an\r\nangry manner.\r\n\r\nJones accepted the invitation; and no sooner was the tea-kettle\r\nremoved, and the girls sent out of the room, than the widow, without\r\nmuch preface, began as follows: “Well, there are very surprizing\r\nthings happen in this world; but certainly it is a wonderful business\r\nthat I should have a relation of Mr Allworthy in my house, and never\r\nknow anything of the matter. Alas! sir, you little imagine what a\r\nfriend that best of gentlemen hath been to me and mine. Yes, sir, I am\r\nnot ashamed to own it; it is owing to his goodness that I did not long\r\nsince perish for want, and leave my poor little wretches, two\r\ndestitute, helpless, friendless orphans, to the care, or rather to the\r\ncruelty, of the world.\r\n\r\n“You must know, sir, though I am now reduced to get my living by\r\nletting lodgings, I was born and bred a gentlewoman. My father was an\r\nofficer of the army, and died in a considerable rank: but he lived up\r\nto his pay; and, as that expired with him, his family, at his death,\r\nbecame beggars. We were three sisters. One of us had the good luck to\r\ndie soon after of the small-pox; a lady was so kind as to take the\r\nsecond out of charity, as she said, to wait upon her. The mother of\r\nthis lady had been a servant to my grand-mother; and, having inherited\r\na vast fortune from her father, which he had got by pawnbroking, was\r\nmarried to a gentleman of great estate and fashion. She used my sister\r\nso barbarously, often upbraiding her with her birth and poverty,\r\ncalling her in derision a gentlewoman, that I believe she at length\r\nbroke the heart of the poor girl. In short, she likewise died within a\r\ntwelvemonth after my father. Fortune thought proper to provide better\r\nfor me, and within a month from his decease I was married to a\r\nclergyman, who had been my lover a long time before, and who had been\r\nvery ill used by my father on that account: for though my poor father\r\ncould not give any of us a shilling, yet he bred us up as delicately,\r\nconsidered us, and would have had us consider ourselves, as highly as\r\nif we had been the richest heiresses. But my dear husband forgot all\r\nthis usage, and the moment we were become fatherless he immediately\r\nrenewed his addresses to me so warmly, that I, who always liked, and\r\nnow more than ever esteemed him, soon complied. Five years did I live\r\nin a state of perfect happiness with that best of men, till at\r\nlast--Oh! cruel! cruel fortune, that ever separated us, that deprived\r\nme of the kindest of husbands and my poor girls of the tenderest\r\nparent.--O my poor girls! you never knew the blessing which ye\r\nlost.--I am ashamed, Mr Jones, of this womanish weakness; but I shall\r\nnever mention him without tears.” “I ought rather, madam,” said Jones,\r\n“to be ashamed that I do not accompany you.” “Well, sir,” continued\r\nshe, “I was now left a second time in a much worse condition than\r\nbefore; besides the terrible affliction I was to encounter, I had now\r\ntwo children to provide for; and was, if possible, more pennyless than\r\never; when that great, that good, that glorious man, Mr Allworthy, who\r\nhad some little acquaintance with my husband, accidentally heard of my\r\ndistress, and immediately writ this letter to me. Here, sir, here it\r\nis; I put it into my pocket to shew it you. This is the letter, sir; I\r\nmust and will read it to you.\r\n\r\n “'Madam,\r\n\r\n “'I heartily condole with you on your late grievous loss, which your\r\n own good sense, and the excellent lessons you must have learnt from\r\n the worthiest of men, will better enable you to bear than any advice\r\n which I am capable of giving. Nor have I any doubt that you, whom I\r\n have heard to be the tenderest of mothers, will suffer any\r\n immoderate indulgence of grief to prevent you from discharging your\r\n duty to those poor infants, who now alone stand in need of your\r\n tenderness.\r\n\r\n “`However, as you must be supposed at present to be incapable of\r\n much worldly consideration, you will pardon my having ordered a\r\n person to wait on you, and to pay you twenty guineas, which I beg\r\n you will accept till I have the pleasure of seeing you, and believe\r\n me to be, madam, &c.'\r\n\r\n“This letter, sir, I received within a fortnight after the irreparable\r\nloss I have mentioned; and within a fortnight afterwards, Mr\r\nAllworthy--the blessed Mr Allworthy, came to pay me a visit, when he\r\nplaced me in the house where you now see me, gave me a large sum of\r\nmoney to furnish it, and settled an annuity of £50 a-year upon me,\r\nwhich I have constantly received ever since. Judge, then, Mr Jones, in\r\nwhat regard I must hold a benefactor, to whom I owe the preservation\r\nof my life, and of those dear children, for whose sake alone my life\r\nis valuable. Do not, therefore, think me impertinent, Mr Jones (since\r\nI must esteem one for whom I know Mr Allworthy hath so much value), if\r\nI beg you not to converse with these wicked women. You are a young\r\ngentleman, and do not know half their artful wiles. Do not be angry\r\nwith me, sir, for what I said upon account of my house; you must be\r\nsensible it would be the ruin of my poor dear girls. Besides, sir, you\r\ncannot but be acquainted that Mr Allworthy himself would never forgive\r\nmy conniving at such matters, and particularly with you.”\r\n\r\n“Upon my word, madam,” said Jones, “you need make no farther apology;\r\nnor do I in the least take anything ill you have said; but give me\r\nleave, as no one can have more value than myself for Mr Allworthy, to\r\ndeliver you from one mistake, which, perhaps, would not be altogether\r\nfor his honour; I do assure you, I am no relation of his.”\r\n\r\n“Alas! sir,” answered she, “I know you are not, I know very well who\r\nyou are; for Mr Allworthy hath told me all; but I do assure you, had\r\nyou been twenty times his son, he could not have expressed more regard\r\nfor you than he hath often expressed in my presence. You need not be\r\nashamed, sir, of what you are; I promise you no good person will\r\nesteem you the less on that account. No, Mr Jones, the words\r\n`dishonourable birth' are nonsense, as my dear, dear husband used to\r\nsay, unless the word `dishonourable' be applied to the parents; for\r\nthe children can derive no real dishonour from an act of which they\r\nare intirely innocent.”\r\n\r\nHere Jones heaved a deep sigh, and then said, “Since I perceive,\r\nmadam, you really do know me, and Mr Allworthy hath thought proper to\r\nmention my name to you; and since you have been so explicit with me as\r\nto your own affairs, I will acquaint you with some more circumstances\r\nconcerning myself.” And these Mrs Miller having expressed great desire\r\nand curiosity to hear, he began and related to her his whole history,\r\nwithout once mentioning the name of Sophia.\r\n\r\nThere is a kind of sympathy in honest minds, by means of which they\r\ngive an easy credit to each other. Mrs Miller believed all which Jones\r\ntold her to be true, and exprest much pity and concern for him. She\r\nwas beginning to comment on the story, but Jones interrupted her; for,\r\nas the hour of assignation now drew nigh, he began to stipulate for a\r\nsecond interview with the lady that evening, which he promised should\r\nbe the last at her house; swearing, at the same time, that she was one\r\nof great distinction, and that nothing but what was intirely innocent\r\nwas to pass between them; and I do firmly believe he intended to keep\r\nhis word.\r\n\r\nMrs Miller was at length prevailed on, and Jones departed to his\r\nchamber, where he sat alone till twelve o'clock, but no Lady Bellaston\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\nAs we have said that this lady had a great affection for Jones, and as\r\nit must have appeared that she really had so, the reader may perhaps\r\nwonder at the first failure of her appointment, as she apprehended him\r\nto be confined by sickness, a season when friendship seems most to\r\nrequire such visits. This behaviour, therefore, in the lady, may, by\r\nsome, be condemned as unnatural; but that is not our fault; for our\r\nbusiness is only to record truth."

      "title": "Chapter vi.",
      "content": "Containing a scene which we doubt not will affect all our readers.\r\n\nMr Jones closed not his eyes during all the former part of the night;\r\nnot owing to any uneasiness which he conceived at being disappointed\r\nby Lady Bellaston; nor was Sophia herself, though most of his waking\r\nhours were justly to be charged to her account, the present cause of\r\ndispelling his slumbers. In fact, poor Jones was one of the\r\nbest-natured fellows alive, and had all that weakness which is called\r\ncompassion, and which distinguishes this imperfect character from that\r\nnoble firmness of mind, which rolls a man, as it were, within himself,\r\nand like a polished bowl, enables him to run through the world without\r\nbeing once stopped by the calamities which happen to others. He could\r\nnot help, therefore, compassionating the situation of poor Nancy,\r\nwhose love for Mr Nightingale seemed to him so apparent, that he was\r\nastonished at the blindness of her mother, who had more than once, the\r\npreceding evening, remarked to him the great change in the temper of\r\nher daughter, “who from being,” she said, “one of the liveliest,\r\nmerriest girls in the world, was, on a sudden, become all gloom and\r\nmelancholy.”\r\n\r\nSleep, however, at length got the better of all resistance; and now,\r\nas if he had already been a deity, as the antients imagined, and an\r\noffended one too, he seemed to enjoy his dear-bought conquest.--To\r\nspeak simply, and without any metaphor, Mr Jones slept till eleven the\r\nnext morning, and would, perhaps, have continued in the same quiet\r\nsituation much longer, had not a violent uproar awakened him.\r\n\r\nPartridge was now summoned, who, being asked what was the matter,\r\nanswered, “That there was a dreadful hurricane below-stairs; that\r\nMiss Nancy was in fits; and that the other sister, and the mother,\r\nwere both crying and lamenting over her.” Jones expressed much\r\nconcern at this news; which Partridge endeavoured to relieve, by\r\nsaying, with a smile, “he fancied the young lady was in no danger of\r\ndeath; for that Susan” (which was the name of the maid) “had given\r\nhim to understand, it was nothing more than a common affair. In\r\nshort,” said he, “Miss Nancy hath had a mind to be as wise as her\r\nmother; that's all; she was a little hungry, it seems, and so sat\r\ndown to dinner before grace was said; and so there is a child coming\r\nfor the Foundling Hospital.”----“Prithee, leave thy stupid jesting,”\r\n cries Jones. “Is the misery of these poor wretches a subject of\r\nmirth? Go immediately to Mrs Miller, and tell her I beg leave--Stay,\r\nyou will make some blunder; I will go myself; for she desired me to\r\nbreakfast with her.” He then rose and dressed himself as fast as he\r\ncould; and while he was dressing, Partridge, notwithstanding many\r\nsevere rebukes, could not avoid throwing forth certain pieces of\r\nbrutality, commonly called jests, on this occasion. Jones was no\r\nsooner dressed than he walked downstairs, and knocking at the door,\r\nwas presently admitted by the maid, into the outward parlour, which\r\nwas as empty of company as it was of any apparatus for eating. Mrs\r\nMiller was in the inner room with her daughter, whence the maid\r\npresently brought a message to Mr Jones, “That her mistress hoped he\r\nwould excuse the disappointment, but an accident had happened, which\r\nmade it impossible for her to have the pleasure of his company at\r\nbreakfast that day; and begged his pardon for not sending him up\r\nnotice sooner.” Jones desired, “She would give herself no trouble\r\nabout anything so trifling as his disappointment; that he was\r\nheartily sorry for the occasion; and that if he could be of any\r\nservice to her, she might command him.”\r\n\r\nHe had scarce spoke these words, when Mrs Miller, who heard them all,\r\nsuddenly threw open the door, and coming out to him, in a flood of\r\ntears, said, “O Mr Jones! you are certainly one of the best young men\r\nalive. I give you a thousand thanks for your kind offer of your\r\nservice; but, alas! sir, it is out of your power to preserve my poor\r\ngirl.--O my child! my child! she is undone, she is ruined for ever!”\r\n “I hope, madam,” said Jones, “no villain”----“O Mr Jones!” said she,\r\n“that villain who yesterday left my lodgings, hath betrayed my poor\r\ngirl; hath destroyed her.--I know you are a man of honour. You have a\r\ngood--a noble heart, Mr Jones. The actions to which I have been myself\r\na witness, could proceed from no other. I will tell you all: nay,\r\nindeed, it is impossible, after what hath happened, to keep it a\r\nsecret. That Nightingale, that barbarous villain, hath undone my\r\ndaughter. She is--she is--oh! Mr Jones, my girl is with child by him;\r\nand in that condition he hath deserted her. Here! here, sir, is his\r\ncruel letter: read it, Mr Jones, and tell me if such another monster\r\nlives.”\r\n\r\nThe letter was as follows:\r\n\r\n “DEAR NANCY,\r\n\r\n “As I found it impossible to mention to you what, I am afraid, will\r\n be no less shocking to you, than it is to me, I have taken this\r\n method to inform you, that my father insists upon my immediately\r\n paying my addresses to a young lady of fortune, whom he hath\r\n provided for my--I need not write the detested word. Your own good\r\n understanding will make you sensible, how entirely I am obliged to\r\n an obedience, by which I shall be for ever excluded from your dear\r\n arms. The fondness of your mother may encourage you to trust her\r\n with the unhappy consequence of our love, which may be easily kept a\r\n secret from the world, and for which I will take care to provide, as\r\n I will for you. I wish you may feel less on this account than I have\r\n suffered; but summon all your fortitude to your assistance, and\r\n forgive and forget the man, whom nothing but the prospect of certain\r\n ruin could have forced to write this letter. I bid you forget me, I\r\n mean only as a lover; but the best of friends you shall ever find in\r\n your faithful, though unhappy,\r\n\r\n “J. N.”\r\n\r\nWhen Jones had read this letter, they both stood silent during a\r\nminute, looking at each other; at last he began thus: “I cannot\r\nexpress, madam, how much I am shocked at what I have read; yet let me\r\nbeg you, in one particular, to take the writer's advice. Consider the\r\nreputation of your daughter.”----“It is gone, it is lost, Mr Jones,”\r\n cryed she, “as well as her innocence. She received the letter in a\r\nroom full of company, and immediately swooning away upon opening it,\r\nthe contents were known to every one present. But the loss of her\r\nreputation, bad as it is, is not the worst; I shall lose my child; she\r\nhath attempted twice to destroy herself already; and though she hath\r\nbeen hitherto prevented, vows she will not outlive it; nor could I\r\nmyself outlive any accident of that nature.--What then will become of\r\nmy little Betsy, a helpless infant orphan? and the poor little wretch\r\nwill, I believe, break her heart at the miseries with which she sees\r\nher sister and myself distracted, while she is ignorant of the cause.\r\nO 'tis the most sensible, and best-natured little thing! The\r\nbarbarous, cruel----hath destroyed us all. O my poor children! Is this\r\nthe reward of all my cares? Is this the fruit of all my prospects?\r\nHave I so chearfully undergone all the labours and duties of a mother?\r\nHave I been so tender of their infancy, so careful of their education?\r\nHave I been toiling so many years, denying myself even the\r\nconveniences of life, to provide some little sustenance for them, to\r\nlose one or both in such a manner?” “Indeed, madam,” said Jones, with\r\ntears in his eyes, “I pity you from my soul.”--“O! Mr Jones,” answered\r\nshe, “even you, though I know the goodness of your heart, can have no\r\nidea of what I feel. The best, the kindest, the most dutiful of\r\nchildren! O my poor Nancy, the darling of my soul! the delight of my\r\neyes! the pride of my heart! too much, indeed, my pride; for to those\r\nfoolish, ambitious hopes, arising from her beauty, I owe her ruin.\r\nAlas! I saw with pleasure the liking which this young man had for her.\r\nI thought it an honourable affection; and flattered my foolish vanity\r\nwith the thoughts of seeing her married to one so much her superior.\r\nAnd a thousand times in my presence, nay, often in yours, he hath\r\nendeavoured to soothe and encourage these hopes by the most generous\r\nexpressions of disinterested love, which he hath always directed to my\r\npoor girl, and which I, as well as she, believed to be real. Could I\r\nhave believed that these were only snares laid to betray the innocence\r\nof my child, and for the ruin of us all?”--At these words little Betsy\r\ncame running into the room, crying, “Dear mamma, for heaven's sake\r\ncome to my sister; for she is in another fit, and my cousin can't hold\r\nher.” Mrs Miller immediately obeyed the summons; but first ordered\r\nBetsy to stay with Mr Jones, and begged him to entertain her a few\r\nminutes, saying, in the most pathetic voice, “Good heaven! let me\r\npreserve one of my children at least.”\r\n\r\nJones, in compliance with this request, did all he could to comfort\r\nthe little girl, though he was, in reality, himself very highly\r\naffected with Mrs Miller's story. He told her “Her sister would be\r\nsoon very well again; that by taking on in that manner she would not\r\nonly make her sister worse, but make her mother ill too.” “Indeed,\r\nsir,” says she, “I would not do anything to hurt them for the world. I\r\nwould burst my heart rather than they should see me cry.--But my poor\r\nsister can't see me cry.--I am afraid she will never be able to see me\r\ncry any more. Indeed, I can't part with her; indeed, I can't.--And\r\nthen poor mamma too, what will become of her?--She says she will die\r\ntoo, and leave me: but I am resolved I won't be left behind.” “And are\r\nyou not afraid to die, my little Betsy?” said Jones. “Yes,” answered\r\nshe, “I was always afraid to die; because I must have left my mamma,\r\nand my sister; but I am not afraid of going anywhere with those I\r\nlove.”\r\n\r\nJones was so pleased with this answer, that he eagerly kissed the\r\nchild; and soon after Mrs Miller returned, saying, “She thanked heaven\r\nNancy was now come to herself. And now, Betsy,” says she, “you may go\r\nin, for your sister is better, and longs to see you.” She then turned\r\nto Jones, and began to renew her apologies for having disappointed him\r\nof his breakfast.\r\n\r\n“I hope, madam,” said Jones, “I shall have a more exquisite repast\r\nthan any you could have provided for me. This, I assure you, will be\r\nthe case, if I can do any service to this little family of love. But\r\nwhatever success may attend my endeavours, I am resolved to attempt\r\nit. I am very much deceived in Mr Nightingale, if, notwithstanding\r\nwhat hath happened, he hath not much goodness of heart at the bottom,\r\nas well as a very violent affection for your daughter. If this be the\r\ncase, I think the picture which I shall lay before him will affect\r\nhim. Endeavour, madam, to comfort yourself, and Miss Nancy, as well as\r\nyou can. I will go instantly in quest of Mr Nightingale; and I hope to\r\nbring you good news.”\r\n\r\nMrs Miller fell upon her knees and invoked all the blessings of heaven\r\nupon Mr Jones; to which she afterwards added the most passionate\r\nexpressions of gratitude. He then departed to find Mr Nightingale, and\r\nthe good woman returned to comfort her daughter, who was somewhat\r\ncheared at what her mother told her; and both joined in resounding the\r\npraises of Mr Jones."

      "content": "The interview between Mr Jones and Mr Nightingale.\r\n\nThe good or evil we confer on others very often, I believe, recoils on\r\nourselves. For as men of a benign disposition enjoy their own acts of\r\nbeneficence equally with those to whom they are done, so there are\r\nscarce any natures so entirely diabolical, as to be capable of doing\r\ninjuries, without paying themselves some pangs for the ruin which they\r\nbring on their fellow-creatures.\r\n\r\nMr Nightingale, at least, was not such a person. On the contrary,\r\nJones found him in his new lodgings, sitting melancholy by the fire,\r\nand silently lamenting the unhappy situation in which he had placed\r\npoor Nancy. He no sooner saw his friend appear than he arose hastily\r\nto meet him; and after much congratulation said, “Nothing could be\r\nmore opportune than this kind visit; for I was never more in the\r\nspleen in my life.”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry,” answered Jones, “that I bring news very unlikely to\r\nrelieve you: nay, what I am convinced must, of all other, shock you\r\nthe most. However, it is necessary you should know it. Without further\r\npreface, then, I come to you, Mr Nightingale, from a worthy family,\r\nwhich you have involved in misery and ruin.” Mr Nightingale changed\r\ncolour at these words; but Jones, without regarding it, proceeded, in\r\nthe liveliest manner, to paint the tragical story with which the\r\nreader was acquainted in the last chapter.\r\n\r\nNightingale never once interrupted the narration, though he discovered\r\nviolent emotions at many parts of it. But when it was concluded, after\r\nfetching a deep sigh, he said, “What you tell me, my friend, affects\r\nme in the tenderest manner. Sure there never was so cursed an accident\r\nas the poor girl's betraying my letter. Her reputation might otherwise\r\nhave been safe, and the affair might have remained a profound secret;\r\nand then the girl might have gone off never the worse; for many such\r\nthings happen in this town: and if the husband should suspect a\r\nlittle, when it is too late, it will be his wiser conduct to conceal\r\nhis suspicion both from his wife and the world.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, my friend,” answered Jones, “this could not have been the\r\ncase with your poor Nancy. You have so entirely gained her affections,\r\nthat it is the loss of you, and not of her reputation, which afflicts\r\nher, and will end in the destruction of her and her family.” “Nay, for\r\nthat matter, I promise you,” cries Nightingale, “she hath my\r\naffections so absolutely, that my wife, whoever she is to be, will\r\nhave very little share in them.” “And is it possible then,” said\r\nJones, “you can think of deserting her?” “Why, what can I do?”\r\n answered the other. “Ask Miss Nancy,” replied Jones warmly. “In the\r\ncondition to which you have reduced her, I sincerely think she ought\r\nto determine what reparation you shall make her. Her interest alone,\r\nand not yours, ought to be your sole consideration. But if you ask me\r\nwhat you shall do, what can you do less,” cries Jones, “than fulfil\r\nthe expectations of her family, and her own? Nay, I sincerely tell\r\nyou, they were mine too, ever since I first saw you together. You will\r\npardon me if I presume on the friendship you have favoured me with,\r\nmoved as I am with compassion for those poor creatures. But your own\r\nheart will best suggest to you, whether you have never intended, by\r\nyour conduct, to persuade the mother, as well as the daughter, into an\r\nopinion, that you designed honourably: and if so, though there may\r\nhave been no direct promise of marriage in the case, I will leave to\r\nyour own good understanding, how far you are bound to proceed.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, I must not only confess what you have hinted,” said Nightingale;\r\n“but I am afraid even that very promise you mention I have given.”\r\n “And can you, after owning that,” said Jones, “hesitate a moment?”\r\n “Consider, my friend,” answered the other; “I know you are a man of\r\nhonour, and would advise no one to act contrary to its rules; if there\r\nwere no other objection, can I, after this publication of her\r\ndisgrace, think of such an alliance with honour?” “Undoubtedly,”\r\n replied Jones, “and the very best and truest honour, which is\r\ngoodness, requires it of you. As you mention a scruple of this kind,\r\nyou will give me leave to examine it. Can you with honour be guilty of\r\nhaving under false pretences deceived a young woman and her family,\r\nand of having by these means treacherously robbed her of her\r\ninnocence? Can you, with honour, be the knowing, the wilful occasion,\r\nnay, the artful contriver of the ruin of a human being? Can you, with\r\nhonour, destroy the fame, the peace, nay, probably, both the life and\r\nsoul too, of this creature? Can honour bear the thought, that this\r\ncreature is a tender, helpless, defenceless, young woman? A young\r\nwoman, who loves, who doats on you, who dies for you; who hath placed\r\nthe utmost confidence in your promises; and to that confidence hath\r\nsacrificed everything which is dear to her? Can honour support such\r\ncontemplations as these a moment?”\r\n\r\n“Common sense, indeed,” said Nightingale, “warrants all you say; but\r\nyet you well know the opinion of the world is so contrary to it, that,\r\nwas I to marry a whore, though my own, I should be ashamed of ever\r\nshowing my face again.”\r\n\r\n“Fie upon it, Mr Nightingale!” said Jones, “do not call her by so\r\nungenerous a name: when you promised to marry her she became your\r\nwife; and she hath sinned more against prudence than virtue. And what\r\nis this world which you would be ashamed to face but the vile, the\r\nfoolish, and the profligate? Forgive me if I say such a shame must\r\nproceed from false modesty, which always attends false honour as its\r\nshadow.--But I am well assured there is not a man of real sense and\r\ngoodness in the world who would not honour and applaud the action.\r\nBut, admit no other would, would not your own heart, my friend,\r\napplaud it? And do not the warm, rapturous sensations, which we feel\r\nfrom the consciousness of an honest, noble, generous, benevolent\r\naction, convey more delight to the mind than the undeserved praise of\r\nmillions? Set the alternative fairly before your eyes. On the one\r\nside, see this poor, unhappy, tender, believing girl, in the arms of\r\nher wretched mother, breathing her last. Hear her breaking heart in\r\nagonies, sighing out your name; and lamenting, rather than accusing,\r\nthe cruelty which weighs her down to destruction. Paint to your\r\nimagination the circumstances of her fond despairing parent, driven to\r\nmadness, or, perhaps, to death, by the loss of her lovely daughter.\r\nView the poor, helpless, orphan infant; and when your mind hath dwelt\r\na moment only on such ideas, consider yourself as the cause of all the\r\nruin of this poor, little, worthy, defenceless family. On the other\r\nside, consider yourself as relieving them from their temporary\r\nsufferings. Think with what joy, with what transports that lovely\r\ncreature will fly to your arms. See her blood returning to her pale\r\ncheeks, her fire to her languid eyes, and raptures to her tortured\r\nbreast. Consider the exultations of her mother, the happiness of all.\r\nThink of this little family made by one act of yours completely happy.\r\nThink of this alternative, and sure I am mistaken in my friend if it\r\nrequires any long deliberation whether he will sink these wretches\r\ndown for ever, or, by one generous, noble resolution, raise them all\r\nfrom the brink of misery and despair to the highest pitch of human\r\nhappiness. Add to this but one consideration more; the consideration\r\nthat it is your duty so to do--That the misery from which you will\r\nrelieve these poor people is the misery which you yourself have\r\nwilfully brought upon them.”\r\n\r\n“O, my dear friend!” cries Nightingale, “I wanted not your eloquence\r\nto rouse me. I pity poor Nancy from my soul, and would willingly give\r\nanything in my power that no familiarities had ever passed between us.\r\nNay, believe me, I had many struggles with my passion before I could\r\nprevail with myself to write that cruel letter, which hath caused all\r\nthe misery in that unhappy family. If I had no inclinations to consult\r\nbut my own, I would marry her to-morrow morning: I would, by heaven!\r\nbut you will easily imagine how impossible it would be to prevail on\r\nmy father to consent to such a match; besides, he hath provided\r\nanother for me; and to-morrow, by his express command, I am to wait on\r\nthe lady.”\r\n\r\n“I have not the honour to know your father,” said Jones; “but, suppose\r\nhe could be persuaded, would you yourself consent to the only means of\r\npreserving these poor people?” “As eagerly as I would pursue my\r\nhappiness,” answered Nightingale: “for I never shall find it in any\r\nother woman.--O, my dear friend! could you imagine what I have felt\r\nwithin these twelve hours for my poor girl, I am convinced she would\r\nnot engross all your pity. Passion leads me only to her; and, if I had\r\nany foolish scruples of honour, you have fully satisfied them: could\r\nmy father be induced to comply with my desires, nothing would be\r\nwanting to compleat my own happiness or that of my Nancy.”\r\n\r\n“Then I am resolved to undertake it,” said Jones. “You must not be\r\nangry with me, in whatever light it may be necessary to set this\r\naffair, which, you may depend on it, could not otherwise be long hid\r\nfrom him: for things of this nature make a quick progress when once\r\nthey get abroad, as this unhappily hath already. Besides, should any\r\nfatal accident follow, as upon my soul I am afraid will, unless\r\nimmediately prevented, the public would ring of your name in a manner\r\nwhich, if your father hath common humanity, must offend him. If you\r\nwill therefore tell me where I may find the old gentleman, I will not\r\nlose a moment in the business; which, while I pursue, you cannot do a\r\nmore generous action than by paying a visit to the poor girl. You will\r\nfind I have not exaggerated in the account I have given of the\r\nwretchedness of the family.”\r\n\r\nNightingale immediately consented to the proposal; and now, having\r\nacquainted Jones with his father's lodging, and the coffee-house where\r\nhe would most probably find him, he hesitated a moment, and then said,\r\n“My dear Tom, you are going to undertake an impossibility. If you knew\r\nmy father you would never think of obtaining his consent.----Stay,\r\nthere is one way--suppose you told him I was already married, it might\r\nbe easier to reconcile him to the fact after it was done; and, upon my\r\nhonour, I am so affected with what you have said, and I love my Nancy\r\nso passionately, I almost wish it was done, whatever might be the\r\nconsequence.”\r\n\r\nJones greatly approved the hint, and promised to pursue it. They then\r\nseparated, Nightingale to visit his Nancy, and Jones in quest of the\r\nold gentleman."

      "content": "What passed between Jones and old Mr Nightingale; with the arrival of\r\na person not yet mentioned in this history.\r\n\nNotwithstanding the sentiment of the Roman satirist, which denies the\r\ndivinity of fortune, and the opinion of Seneca to the same purpose;\r\nCicero, who was, I believe, a wiser man than either of them, expressly\r\nholds the contrary; and certain it is, there are some incidents in\r\nlife so very strange and unaccountable, that it seems to require more\r\nthan human skill and foresight in producing them.\r\n\r\nOf this kind was what now happened to Jones, who found Mr Nightingale\r\nthe elder in so critical a minute, that Fortune, if she was really\r\nworthy all the worship she received at Rome, could not have contrived\r\nsuch another. In short, the old gentleman, and the father of the young\r\nlady whom he intended for his son, had been hard at it for many hours;\r\nand the latter was just now gone, and had left the former delighted\r\nwith the thoughts that he had succeeded in a long contention, which\r\nhad been between the two fathers of the future bride and bridegroom;\r\nin which both endeavoured to overreach the other, and, as it not\r\nrarely happens in such cases, both had retreated fully satisfied of\r\nhaving obtained the victory.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman, whom Mr Jones now visited, was what they call a man of\r\nthe world; that is to say, a man who directs his conduct in this world\r\nas one who, being fully persuaded there is no other, is resolved to\r\nmake the most of this. In his early years he had been bred to trade;\r\nbut, having acquired a very good fortune, he had lately declined his\r\nbusiness; or, to speak more properly, had changed it from dealing in\r\ngoods, to dealing only in money, of which he had always a plentiful\r\nfund at command, and of which he knew very well how to make a very\r\nplentiful advantage, sometimes of the necessities of private men, and\r\nsometimes of those of the public. He had indeed conversed so entirely\r\nwith money, that it may be almost doubted whether he imagined there\r\nwas any other thing really existing in the world; this at least may be\r\ncertainly averred, that he firmly believed nothing else to have any\r\nreal value.\r\n\r\nThe reader will, I fancy, allow that Fortune could not have culled out\r\na more improper person for Mr Jones to attack with any probability of\r\nsuccess; nor could the whimsical lady have directed this attack at a\r\nmore unseasonable time.\r\n\r\nAs money then was always uppermost in this gentleman's thoughts, so\r\nthe moment he saw a stranger within his doors it immediately occurred\r\nto his imagination, that such stranger was either come to bring him\r\nmoney, or to fetch it from him. And according as one or other of these\r\nthoughts prevailed, he conceived a favourable or unfavourable idea of\r\nthe person who approached him.\r\n\r\nUnluckily for Jones, the latter of these was the ascendant at present;\r\nfor as a young gentleman had visited him the day before, with a bill\r\nfrom his son for a play debt, he apprehended, at the first sight of\r\nJones, that he was come on such another errand. Jones therefore had no\r\nsooner told him that he was come on his son's account than the old\r\ngentleman, being confirmed in his suspicion, burst forth into an\r\nexclamation, “That he would lose his labour.” “Is it then possible,\r\nsir,” answered Jones, “that you can guess my business?” “If I do guess\r\nit,” replied the other, “I repeat again to you, you will lose your\r\nlabour. What, I suppose you are one of those sparks who lead my son\r\ninto all those scenes of riot and debauchery, which will be his\r\ndestruction? but I shall pay no more of his bills, I promise you. I\r\nexpect he will quit all such company for the future. If I had imagined\r\notherwise, I should not have provided a wife for him; for I would be\r\ninstrumental in the ruin of nobody.” “How, sir,” said Jones, “and was\r\nthis lady of your providing?” “Pray, sir,” answered the old gentleman,\r\n“how comes it to be any concern of yours?”--“Nay, dear sir,” replied\r\nJones, “be not offended that I interest myself in what regards your\r\nson's happiness, for whom I have so great an honour and value. It was\r\nupon that very account I came to wait upon you. I can't express the\r\nsatisfaction you have given me by what you say; for I do assure you\r\nyour son is a person for whom I have the highest honour.--Nay, sir, it\r\nis not easy to express the esteem I have for you; who could be so\r\ngenerous, so good, so kind, so indulgent to provide such a match for\r\nyour son; a woman, who, I dare swear, will make him one of the\r\nhappiest men upon earth.”\r\n\r\nThere is scarce anything which so happily introduces men to our good\r\nliking, as having conceived some alarm at their first appearance; when\r\nonce those apprehensions begin to vanish we soon forget the fears\r\nwhich they occasioned, and look on ourselves as indebted for our\r\npresent ease to those very persons who at first raised our fears.\r\n\r\nThus it happened to Nightingale, who no sooner found that Jones had no\r\ndemand on him, as he suspected, than he began to be pleased with his\r\npresence. “Pray, good sir,” said he, “be pleased to sit down. I do not\r\nremember to have ever had the pleasure of seeing you before; but if\r\nyou are a friend of my son, and have anything to say concerning this\r\nyoung lady, I shall be glad to hear you. As to her making him happy,\r\nit will be his own fault if she doth not. I have discharged my duty,\r\nin taking care of the main article. She will bring him a fortune\r\ncapable of making any reasonable, prudent, sober man, happy.”\r\n “Undoubtedly,” cries Jones, “for she is in herself a fortune; so\r\nbeautiful, so genteel, so sweet-tempered, and so well-educated; she is\r\nindeed a most accomplished young lady; sings admirably well, and hath\r\na most delicate hand at the harpsichord.” “I did not know any of these\r\nmatters,” answered the old gentleman, “for I never saw the lady: but I\r\ndo not like her the worse for what you tell me; and I am the better\r\npleased with her father for not laying any stress on these\r\nqualifications in our bargain. I shall always think it a proof of his\r\nunderstanding. A silly fellow would have brought in these articles as\r\nan addition to her fortune; but, to give him his due, he never\r\nmentioned any such matter; though to be sure they are no\r\ndisparagements to a woman.” “I do assure you, sir,” cries Jones, “she\r\nhath them all in the most eminent degree: for my part, I own I was\r\nafraid you might have been a little backward, a little less inclined\r\nto the match; for your son told me you had never seen the lady;\r\ntherefore I came, sir, in that case, to entreat you, to conjure you,\r\nas you value the happiness of your son, not to be averse to his match\r\nwith a woman who hath not only all the good qualities I have\r\nmentioned, but many more.”--“If that was your business, sir,” said the\r\nold gentleman, “we are both obliged to you; and you may be perfectly\r\neasy; for I give you my word I was very well satisfied with her\r\nfortune.” “Sir,” answered Jones, “I honour you every moment more and\r\nmore. To be so easily satisfied, so very moderate on that account, is\r\na proof of the soundness of your understanding, as well as the\r\nnobleness of your mind.”----“Not so very moderate, young gentleman,\r\nnot so very moderate,” answered the father.--“Still more and more\r\nnoble,” replied Jones; “and give me leave to add, sensible: for sure\r\nit is little less than madness to consider money as the sole\r\nfoundation of happiness. Such a woman as this with her little, her\r\nnothing of a fortune”--“I find,” cries the old gentleman, “you have a\r\npretty just opinion of money, my friend, or else you are better\r\nacquainted with the person of the lady than with her circumstances.\r\nWhy, pray, what fortune do you imagine this lady to have?” “What\r\nfortune?” cries Jones, “why, too contemptible a one to be named for\r\nyour son.”--“Well, well, well,” said the other, “perhaps he might have\r\ndone better.”--“That I deny,” said Jones, “for she is one of the best\r\nof women.”--“Ay, ay, but in point of fortune I mean,” answered the\r\nother. “And yet, as to that now, how much do you imagine your friend\r\nis to have?”--“How much?” cries Jones, “how much? Why, at the utmost,\r\nperhaps £200.” “Do you mean to banter me, young gentleman?” said the\r\nfather, a little angry. “No, upon my soul,” answered Jones, “I am in\r\nearnest: nay, I believe I have gone to the utmost farthing. If I do\r\nthe lady an injury, I ask her pardon.” “Indeed you do,” cries the\r\nfather; “I am certain she hath fifty times that sum, and she shall\r\nproduce fifty to that before I consent that she shall marry my son.”\r\n “Nay,” said Jones, “it is too late to talk of consent now; if she had\r\nnot fifty farthings your son is married.”--“My son married!” answered\r\nthe old gentleman, with surprize. “Nay,” said Jones, “I thought you\r\nwas unacquainted with it.” “My son married to Miss Harris!” answered\r\nhe again. “To Miss Harris!” said Jones; “no, sir; to Miss Nancy\r\nMiller, the daughter of Mrs Miller, at whose house he lodged; a young\r\nlady, who, though her mother is reduced to let lodgings--“--“Are you\r\nbantering, or are you in earnest?” cries the father, with a most\r\nsolemn voice. “Indeed, sir,” answered Jones, “I scorn the character of\r\na banterer. I came to you in most serious earnest, imagining, as I\r\nfind true, that your son had never dared acquaint you with a match so\r\nmuch inferior to him in point of fortune, though the reputation of the\r\nlady will suffer it no longer to remain a secret.”\r\n\r\nWhile the father stood like one struck suddenly dumb at this news, a\r\ngentleman came into the room, and saluted him by the name of brother.\r\n\r\nBut though these two were in consanguinity so nearly related, they\r\nwere in their dispositions almost the opposites to each other. The\r\nbrother who now arrived had likewise been bred to trade, in which he\r\nno sooner saw himself worth £6000 than he purchased a small estate\r\nwith the greatest part of it, and retired into the country; where he\r\nmarried the daughter of an unbeneficed clergyman; a young lady, who,\r\nthough she had neither beauty nor fortune, had recommended herself to\r\nhis choice entirely by her good humour, of which she possessed a very\r\nlarge share.\r\n\r\nWith this woman he had, during twenty-five years, lived a life more\r\nresembling the model which certain poets ascribe to the golden age,\r\nthan any of those patterns which are furnished by the present times.\r\nBy her he had four children, but none of them arrived at maturity,\r\nexcept only one daughter, whom, in vulgar language, he and his wife\r\nhad spoiled; that is, had educated with the utmost tenderness and\r\nfondness, which she returned to such a degree, that she had actually\r\nrefused a very extraordinary match with a gentleman a little turned of\r\nforty, because she could not bring herself to part with her parents.\r\n\r\nThe young lady whom Mr Nightingale had intended for his son was a near\r\nneighbour of his brother, and an acquaintance of his niece; and in\r\nreality it was upon the account of his projected match that he was now\r\ncome to town; not, indeed, to forward, but to dissuade his brother\r\nfrom a purpose which he conceived would inevitably ruin his nephew;\r\nfor he foresaw no other event from a union with Miss Harris,\r\nnotwithstanding the largeness of her fortune, as neither her person\r\nnor mind seemed to him to promise any kind of matrimonial felicity:\r\nfor she was very tall, very thin, very ugly, very affected, very\r\nsilly, and very ill-natured.\r\n\r\nHis brother, therefore, no sooner mentioned the marriage of his nephew\r\nwith Miss Miller, than he exprest the utmost satisfaction; and when\r\nthe father had very bitterly reviled his son, and pronounced sentence\r\nof beggary upon him, the uncle began in the following manner:\r\n\r\n“If you was a little cooler, brother, I would ask you whether you love\r\nyour son for his sake or for your own. You would answer, I suppose,\r\nand so I suppose you think, for his sake; and doubtless it is his\r\nhappiness which you intended in the marriage you proposed for him.\r\n\r\n“Now, brother, to prescribe rules of happiness to others hath always\r\nappeared to me very absurd, and to insist on doing this, very\r\ntyrannical. It is a vulgar error, I know; but it is, nevertheless, an\r\nerror. And if this be absurd in other things, it is mostly so in the\r\naffair of marriage, the happiness of which depends entirely on the\r\naffection which subsists between the parties.\r\n\r\n“I have therefore always thought it unreasonable in parents to desire\r\nto chuse for their children on this occasion; since to force affection\r\nis an impossible attempt; nay, so much doth love abhor force, that I\r\nknow not whether, through an unfortunate but uncurable perverseness in\r\nour natures, it may not be even impatient of persuasion.\r\n\r\n“It is, however, true that, though a parent will not, I think, wisely\r\nprescribe, he ought to be consulted on this occasion; and, in\r\nstrictness, perhaps, should at least have a negative voice. My nephew,\r\ntherefore, I own, in marrying, without asking your advice, hath been\r\nguilty of a fault. But, honestly speaking, brother, have you not a\r\nlittle promoted this fault? Have not your frequent declarations on\r\nthis subject given him a moral certainty of your refusal, where there\r\nwas any deficiency in point of fortune? Nay, doth not your present\r\nanger arise solely from that deficiency? And if he hath failed in his\r\nduty here, did you not as much exceed that authority when you\r\nabsolutely bargained with him for a woman, without his knowledge, whom\r\nyou yourself never saw, and whom, if you had seen and known as well as\r\nI, it must have been madness in you to have ever thought of bringing\r\nher into your family?\r\n\r\n“Still I own my nephew in a fault; but surely it is not an\r\nunpardonable fault. He hath acted indeed without your consent, in a\r\nmatter in which he ought to have asked it, but it is in a matter in\r\nwhich his interest is principally concerned; you yourself must and\r\nwill acknowledge that you consulted his interest only, and if he\r\nunfortunately differed from you, and hath been mistaken in his notion\r\nof happiness, will you, brother, if you love your son, carry him still\r\nwider from the point? Will you increase the ill consequences of his\r\nsimple choice? Will you endeavour to make an event certain misery to\r\nhim, which may accidentally prove so? In a word, brother, because he\r\nhath put it out of your power to make his circumstances as affluent as\r\nyou would, will you distress them as much as you can?”\r\n\r\nBy the force of the true Catholic faith St Anthony won upon the\r\nfishes. Orpheus and Amphion went a little farther, and by the charms\r\nof music enchanted things merely inanimate. Wonderful, both! but\r\nneither history nor fable have ever yet ventured to record an instance\r\nof any one, who, by force of argument and reason, hath triumphed over\r\nhabitual avarice.\r\n\r\nMr Nightingale, the father, instead of attempting to answer his\r\nbrother, contented himself with only observing, that they had always\r\ndiffered in their sentiments concerning the education of their\r\nchildren. “I wish,” said he, “brother, you would have confined your\r\ncare to your own daughter, and never have troubled yourself with my\r\nson, who hath, I believe, as little profited by your precepts, as by\r\nyour example.” For young Nightingale was his uncle's godson, and had\r\nlived more with him than with his father. So that the uncle had often\r\ndeclared he loved his nephew almost equally with his own child.\r\n\r\nJones fell into raptures with this good gentleman; and when, after\r\nmuch persuasion, they found the father grew still more and more\r\nirritated, instead of appeased, Jones conducted the uncle to his\r\nnephew at the house of Mrs Miller."

      "content": "Containing strange matters.\r\n\nAt his return to his lodgings, Jones found the situation of affairs\r\ngreatly altered from what they had been in at his departure. The\r\nmother, the two daughters, and young Mr Nightingale, were now sat down\r\nto supper together, when the uncle was, at his own desire, introduced\r\nwithout any ceremony into the company, to all of whom he was well\r\nknown; for he had several times visited his nephew at that house.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman immediately walked up to Miss Nancy, saluted and\r\nwished her joy, as he did afterwards the mother and the other sister;\r\nand lastly, he paid the proper compliments to his nephew, with the\r\nsame good humour and courtesy, as if his nephew had married his equal\r\nor superior in fortune, with all the previous requisites first\r\nperformed.\r\n\r\nMiss Nancy and her supposed husband both turned pale, and looked\r\nrather foolish than otherwise upon the occasion; but Mrs Miller took\r\nthe first opportunity of withdrawing; and, having sent for Jones into\r\nthe dining-room, she threw herself at his feet, and in a most\r\npassionate flood of tears, called him her good angel, the preserver of\r\nher poor little family, with many other respectful and endearing\r\nappellations, and made him every acknowledgment which the highest\r\nbenefit can extract from the most grateful heart.\r\n\r\nAfter the first gust of her passion was a little over, which she\r\ndeclared, if she had not vented, would have burst her, she proceeded\r\nto inform Mr Jones that all matters were settled between Mr\r\nNightingale and her daughter, and that they were to be married the\r\nnext morning; at which Mr Jones having expressed much pleasure, the\r\npoor woman fell again into a fit of joy and thanksgiving, which he at\r\nlength with difficulty silenced, and prevailed on her to return with\r\nhim back to the company, whom they found in the same good humour in\r\nwhich they had left them.\r\n\r\nThis little society now past two or three very agreeable hours\r\ntogether, in which the uncle, who was a very great lover of his\r\nbottle, had so well plyed his nephew, that this latter, though not\r\ndrunk, began to be somewhat flustered; and now Mr Nightingale, taking\r\nthe old gentleman with him upstairs into the apartment he had lately\r\noccupied, unbosomed himself as follows:--\r\n\r\n“As you have been always the best and kindest of uncles to me, and as\r\nyou have shown such unparalleled goodness in forgiving this match,\r\nwhich to be sure may be thought a little improvident, I should never\r\nforgive myself if I attempted to deceive you in anything.” He then\r\nconfessed the truth, and opened the whole affair.\r\n\r\n“How, Jack?” said the old gentleman, “and are you really then not\r\nmarried to this young woman?” “No, upon my honour,” answered\r\nNightingale, “I have told you the simple truth.” “My dear boy,” cries\r\nthe uncle, kissing him, “I am heartily glad to hear it. I never was\r\nbetter pleased in my life. If you had been married I should have\r\nassisted you as much as was in my power to have made the best of a bad\r\nmatter; but there is a great difference between considering a thing\r\nwhich is already done and irrecoverable, and that which is yet to do.\r\nLet your reason have fair play, Jack, and you will see this match in\r\nso foolish and preposterous a light, that there will be no need of any\r\ndissuasive arguments.” “How, sir?” replies young Nightingale, “is\r\nthere this difference between having already done an act, and being in\r\nhonour engaged to do it?” “Pugh!” said the uncle, “honour is a\r\ncreature of the world's making, and the world hath the power of a\r\ncreator over it, and may govern and direct it as they please. Now you\r\nwell know how trivial these breaches of contract are thought; even the\r\ngrossest make but the wonder and conversation of a day. Is there a man\r\nwho afterwards will be more backward in giving you his sister, or\r\ndaughter? or is there any sister or daughter who would be more\r\nbackward to receive you? Honour is not concerned in these\r\nengagements.” “Pardon me, dear sir,” cries Nightingale, “I can never\r\nthink so; and not only honour, but conscience and humanity, are\r\nconcerned. I am well satisfied, that, was I now to disappoint the\r\nyoung creature, her death would be the consequence, and I should look\r\nupon myself as her murderer; nay, as her murderer by the cruellest of\r\nall methods, by breaking her heart.” “Break her heart, indeed! no, no,\r\nJack,” cries the uncle, “the hearts of women are not so soon broke;\r\nthey are tough, boy, they are tough.” “But, sir,” answered\r\nNightingale, “my own affections are engaged, and I never could be\r\nhappy with any other woman. How often have I heard you say, that\r\nchildren should be always suffered to chuse for themselves, and that\r\nyou would let my cousin Harriet do so?” “Why, ay,” replied the old\r\ngentleman, “so I would have them; but then I would have them chuse\r\nwisely.--Indeed, Jack, you must and shall leave the girl.”----“Indeed,\r\nuncle,” cries the other, “I must and will have her.” “You will, young\r\ngentleman;” said the uncle; “I did not expect such a word from you. I\r\nshould not wonder if you had used such language to your father, who\r\nhath always treated you like a dog, and kept you at the distance which\r\na tyrant preserves over his subjects; but I, who have lived with you\r\nupon an equal footing, might surely expect better usage: but I know\r\nhow to account for it all: it is all owing to your preposterous\r\neducation, in which I have had too little share. There is my daughter,\r\nnow, whom I have brought up as my friend, never doth anything without\r\nmy advice, nor ever refuses to take it when I give it her.” “You have\r\nnever yet given her advice in an affair of this kind,” said\r\nNightingale; “for I am greatly mistaken in my cousin, if she would be\r\nvery ready to obey even your most positive commands in abandoning her\r\ninclinations.” “Don't abuse my girl,” answered the old gentleman with\r\nsome emotion; “don't abuse my Harriet. I have brought her up to have\r\nno inclinations contrary to my own. By suffering her to do whatever\r\nshe pleases, I have enured her to a habit of being pleased to do\r\nwhatever I like.” “Pardon, me, sir,” said Nightingale, “I have not the\r\nleast design to reflect on my cousin, for whom I have the greatest\r\nesteem; and indeed I am convinced you will never put her to so severe\r\na tryal, or lay such hard commands on her as you would do on me.--But,\r\ndear sir, let us return to the company; for they will begin to be\r\nuneasy at our long absence. I must beg one favour of my dear uncle,\r\nwhich is that he would not say anything to shock the poor girl or her\r\nmother.” “Oh! you need not fear me,” answered he, “I understand myself\r\ntoo well to affront women; so I will readily grant you that favour;\r\nand in return I must expect another of you.” “There are but few of\r\nyour commands, sir,” said Nightingale, “which I shall not very\r\nchearfully obey.” “Nay, sir, I ask nothing,” said the uncle, “but the\r\nhonour of your company home to my lodging, that I may reason the case\r\na little more fully with you; for I would, if possible, have the\r\nsatisfaction of preserving my family, notwithstanding the headstrong\r\nfolly of my brother, who, in his own opinion, is the wisest man in the\r\nworld.”\r\n\r\nNightingale, who well knew his uncle to be as headstrong as his\r\nfather, submitted to attend him home, and then they both returned back\r\ninto the room, where the old gentleman promised to carry himself with\r\nthe same decorum which he had before maintained."

      "content": "A short chapter, which concludes the book.\r\n\nThe long absence of the uncle and nephew had occasioned some disquiet\r\nin the minds of all whom they had left behind them; and the more, as,\r\nduring the preceding dialogue, the uncle had more than once elevated\r\nhis voice, so as to be heard downstairs; which, though they could not\r\ndistinguish what he said, had caused some evil foreboding in Nancy and\r\nher mother, and, indeed, even in Jones himself.\r\n\r\nWhen the good company, therefore, again assembled, there was a visible\r\nalteration in all their faces; and the good-humour which, at their\r\nlast meeting, universally shone forth in every countenance, was now\r\nchanged into a much less agreeable aspect. It was a change, indeed,\r\ncommon enough to the weather in this climate, from sunshine to clouds,\r\nfrom June to December.\r\n\r\nThis alteration was not, however, greatly remarked by any present; for\r\nas they were all now endeavouring to conceal their own thoughts, and\r\nto act a part, they became all too busily engaged in the scene to be\r\nspectators of it. Thus neither the uncle nor nephew saw any symptoms\r\nof suspicion in the mother or daughter; nor did the mother or daughter\r\nremark the overacted complacence of the old man, nor the counterfeit\r\nsatisfaction which grinned in the features of the young one.\r\n\r\nSomething like this, I believe, frequently happens, where the whole\r\nattention of two friends being engaged in the part which each is to\r\nact, in order to impose on the other, neither sees nor suspects the\r\narts practised against himself; and thus the thrust of both (to borrow\r\nno improper metaphor on the occasion) alike takes place.\r\n\r\nFrom the same reason it is no unusual thing for both parties to be\r\noverreached in a bargain, though the one must be always the greater\r\nloser; as was he who sold a blind horse, and received a bad note in\r\npayment.\r\n\r\nOur company in about half an hour broke up, and the uncle carried off\r\nhis nephew; but not before the latter had assured Miss Nancy, in a\r\nwhisper, that he would attend her early in the morning, and fulfil all\r\nhis engagements.\r\n\r\nJones, who was the least concerned in this scene, saw the most. He did\r\nindeed suspect the very fact; for, besides observing the great\r\nalteration in the behaviour of the uncle, the distance he assumed, and\r\nhis overstrained civility to Miss Nancy; the carrying off a bridegroom\r\nfrom his bride at that time of night was so extraordinary a proceeding\r\nthat it could be accounted for only by imagining that young\r\nNightingale had revealed the whole truth, which the apparent openness\r\nof his temper, and his being flustered with liquor, made too probable.\r\n\r\nWhile he was reasoning with himself, whether he should acquaint these\r\npoor people with his suspicion, the maid of the house informed him\r\nthat a gentlewoman desired to speak with him.----He went immediately\r\nout, and, taking the candle from the maid, ushered his visitant\r\nupstairs, who, in the person of Mrs Honour, acquainted him with such\r\ndreadful news concerning his Sophia, that he immediately lost all\r\nconsideration for every other person; and his whole stock of\r\ncompassion was entirely swallowed up in reflections on his own misery,\r\nand on that of his unfortunate angel.\r\n\r\nWhat this dreadful matter was, the reader will be informed, after we\r\nhave first related the many preceding steps which produced it, and\r\nthose will be the subject of the following book.\r\n\nBOOK XV.\r\n\r\nIN WHICH THE HISTORY ADVANCES ABOUT TWO DAYS."

      "content": "Too short to need a preface.\r\n\nThere are a set of religious, or rather moral writers, who teach that\r\nvirtue is the certain road to happiness, and vice to misery, in this\r\nworld. A very wholesome and comfortable doctrine, and to which we have\r\nbut one objection, namely, that it is not true.\r\n\r\nIndeed, if by virtue these writers mean the exercise of those cardinal\r\nvirtues, which like good housewives stay at home, and mind only the\r\nbusiness of their own family, I shall very readily concede the point;\r\nfor so surely do all these contribute and lead to happiness, that I\r\ncould almost wish, in violation of all the antient and modern sages,\r\nto call them rather by the name of wisdom, than by that of virtue;\r\nfor, with regard to this life, no system, I conceive, was ever wiser\r\nthan that of the antient Epicureans, who held this wisdom to\r\nconstitute the chief good; nor foolisher than that of their opposites,\r\nthose modern epicures, who place all felicity in the abundant\r\ngratification of every sensual appetite.\r\n\r\nBut if by virtue is meant (as I almost think it ought) a certain\r\nrelative quality, which is always busying itself without-doors, and\r\nseems as much interested in pursuing the good of others as its own; I\r\ncannot so easily agree that this is the surest way to human happiness;\r\nbecause I am afraid we must then include poverty and contempt, with\r\nall the mischiefs which backbiting, envy, and ingratitude, can bring\r\non mankind, in our idea of happiness; nay, sometimes perhaps we shall\r\nbe obliged to wait upon the said happiness to a jail; since many by\r\nthe above virtue have brought themselves thither.\r\n\r\nI have not now leisure to enter upon so large a field of speculation,\r\nas here seems opening upon me; my design was to wipe off a doctrine\r\nthat lay in my way; since, while Mr Jones was acting the most virtuous\r\npart imaginable in labouring to preserve his fellow-creatures from\r\ndestruction, the devil, or some other evil spirit, one perhaps\r\ncloathed in human flesh, was hard at work to make him completely\r\nmiserable in the ruin of his Sophia.\r\n\r\nThis therefore would seem an exception to the above rule, if indeed it\r\nwas a rule; but as we have in our voyage through life seen so many\r\nother exceptions to it, we chuse to dispute the doctrine on which it\r\nis founded, which we don't apprehend to be Christian, which we are\r\nconvinced is not true, and which is indeed destructive of one of the\r\nnoblest arguments that reason alone can furnish for the belief of\r\nimmortality.\r\n\r\nBut as the reader's curiosity (if he hath any) must be now awake, and\r\nhungry, we shall provide to feed it as fast as we can."

      "content": "In which is opened a very black design against Sophia.\r\n\nI remember a wise old gentleman who used to say, “When children are\r\ndoing nothing, they are doing mischief.” I will not enlarge this\r\nquaint saying to the most beautiful part of the creation in general;\r\nbut so far I may be allowed, that when the effects of female jealousy\r\ndo not appear openly in their proper colours of rage and fury, we may\r\nsuspect that mischievous passion to be at work privately, and\r\nattempting to undermine, what it doth not attack above-ground.\r\n\r\nThis was exemplified in the conduct of Lady Bellaston, who, under all\r\nthe smiles which she wore in her countenance, concealed much\r\nindignation against Sophia; and as she plainly saw that this young\r\nlady stood between her and the full indulgence of her desires, she\r\nresolved to get rid of her by some means or other; nor was it long\r\nbefore a very favourable opportunity of accomplishing this presented\r\nitself to her.\r\n\r\nThe reader may be pleased to remember, that when Sophia was thrown\r\ninto that consternation at the playhouse, by the wit and humour of a\r\nset of young gentlemen who call themselves the town, we informed him,\r\nthat she had put herself under the protection of a young nobleman, who\r\nhad very safely conducted her to her chair.\r\n\r\nThis nobleman, who frequently visited Lady Bellaston, had more than\r\nonce seen Sophia there, since her arrival in town, and had conceived a\r\nvery great liking to her; which liking, as beauty never looks more\r\namiable than in distress, Sophia had in this fright so encreased, that\r\nhe might now, without any great impropriety, be said to be actually in\r\nlove with her.\r\n\r\nIt may easily be believed, that he would not suffer so handsome an\r\noccasion of improving his acquaintance with the beloved object as now\r\noffered itself to elapse, when even good breeding alone might have\r\nprompted him to pay her a visit.\r\n\r\nThe next morning therefore, after this accident, he waited on Sophia,\r\nwith the usual compliments, and hopes that she had received no harm\r\nfrom her last night's adventure.\r\n\r\nAs love, like fire, when once thoroughly kindled, is soon blown into a\r\nflame, Sophia in a very short time compleated her conquest. Time now\r\nflew away unperceived, and the noble lord had been two hours in\r\ncompany with the lady, before it entered into his head that he had\r\nmade too long a visit. Though this circumstance alone would have\r\nalarmed Sophia, who was somewhat more a mistress of computation at\r\npresent; she had indeed much more pregnant evidence from the eyes of\r\nher lover of what past within his bosom; nay, though he did not make\r\nany open declaration of his passion, yet many of his expressions were\r\nrather too warm, and too tender, to have been imputed to complacence,\r\neven in the age when such complacence was in fashion; the very reverse\r\nof which is well known to be the reigning mode at present.\r\n\r\nLady Bellaston had been apprized of his lordship's visit at his first\r\narrival; and the length of it very well satisfied her, that things\r\nwent as she wished, and as indeed she had suspected the second time\r\nshe saw this young couple together. This business, she rightly I think\r\nconcluded, that she should by no means forward by mixing in the\r\ncompany while they were together; she therefore ordered her servants,\r\nthat when my lord was going, they should tell him she desired to speak\r\nwith him; and employed the intermediate time in meditating how best to\r\naccomplish a scheme, which she made no doubt but his lordship would\r\nvery readily embrace the execution of.\r\n\r\nLord Fellamar (for that was the title of this young nobleman) was no\r\nsooner introduced to her ladyship, than she attacked him in the\r\nfollowing strain: “Bless me, my lord, are you here yet? I thought my\r\nservants had made a mistake, and let you go away; and I wanted to see\r\nyou about an affair of some importance.”----“Indeed, Lady Bellaston,”\r\n said he, “I don't wonder you are astonished at the length of my\r\nvisit; for I have staid above two hours, and I did not think I had\r\nstaid above half-a-one.”----“What am I to conclude from thence, my\r\nlord?” said she. “The company must be very agreeable which can make\r\ntime slide away so very deceitfully.”----“Upon my honour,” said he,\r\n“the most agreeable I ever saw. Pray tell me, Lady Bellaston, who is\r\nthis blazing star which you have produced among us all of a\r\nsudden?”----“What blazing star, my lord?” said she, affecting a\r\nsurprize. “I mean,” said he, “the lady I saw here the other day, whom\r\nI had last night in my arms at the playhouse, and to whom I have been\r\nmaking that unreasonable visit.”----“O, my cousin Western!” said she;\r\n“why, that blazing star, my lord, is the daughter of a country booby\r\nsquire, and hath been in town about a fortnight, for the first\r\ntime.”----“Upon my soul,” said he, “I should swear she had been bred\r\nup in a court; for besides her beauty, I never saw anything so\r\ngenteel, so sensible, so polite.”----“O brave!” cries the lady, “my\r\ncousin hath you, I find.”----“Upon my honour,” answered he, “I wish\r\nshe had; for I am in love with her to distraction.”----“Nay, my\r\nlord,” said she, “it is not wishing yourself very ill neither, for\r\nshe is a very great fortune: I assure you she is an only child, and\r\nher father's estate is a good £3000 a-year.” “Then I can assure you,\r\nmadam,” answered the lord, “I think her the best match in England.”\r\n “Indeed, my lord,” replied she, “if you like her, I heartily wish you\r\nhad her.” “If you think so kindly of me, madam,” said he, “as she is\r\na relation of yours, will you do me the honour to propose it to her\r\nfather?” “And are you really then in earnest?” cries the lady, with\r\nan affected gravity. “I hope, madam,” answered he, “you have a better\r\nopinion of me, than to imagine I would jest with your ladyship in an\r\naffair of this kind.” “Indeed, then,” said the lady, “I will most\r\nreadily propose your lordship to her father; and I can, I believe,\r\nassure you of his joyful acceptance of the proposal; but there is a\r\nbar, which I am almost ashamed to mention; and yet it is one you will\r\nnever be able to conquer. You have a rival, my lord, and a rival who,\r\nthough I blush to name him, neither you, nor all the world, will ever\r\nbe able to conquer.” “Upon my word, Lady Bellaston,” cries he, “you\r\nhave struck a damp to my heart, which hath almost deprived me of\r\nbeing.” “Fie, my lord,” said she, “I should rather hope I had struck\r\nfire into you. A lover, and talk of damps in your heart! I rather\r\nimagined you would have asked your rival's name, that you might have\r\nimmediately entered the lists with him.” “I promise you, madam,”\r\n answered he, “there are very few things I would not undertake for\r\nyour charming cousin; but pray, who is this happy man?”--“Why, he\r\nis,” said she, “what I am sorry to say most happy men with us are,\r\none of the lowest fellows in the world. He is a beggar, a bastard, a\r\nfoundling, a fellow in meaner circumstances than one of your\r\nlordship's footmen.” “And is it possible,” cried he, “that a young\r\ncreature with such perfections should think of bestowing herself so\r\nunworthily?” “Alas! my lord,” answered she, “consider the\r\ncountry--the bane of all young women is the country. There they learn\r\na set of romantic notions of love, and I know not what folly, which\r\nthis town and good company can scarce eradicate in a whole winter.”\r\n “Indeed, madam,” replied my lord, “your cousin is of too immense a\r\nvalue to be thrown away; such ruin as this must be prevented.”\r\n “Alas!” cries she, “my lord, how can it be prevented? The family have\r\nalready done all in their power; but the girl is, I think,\r\nintoxicated, and nothing less than ruin will content her. And to deal\r\nmore openly with you, I expect every day to hear she is run away with\r\nhim.” “What you tell me, Lady Bellaston,” answered his lordship,\r\n“affects me most tenderly, and only raises my compassion, instead of\r\nlessening my adoration of your cousin. Some means must be found to\r\npreserve so inestimable a jewel. Hath your ladyship endeavoured to\r\nreason with her?” Here the lady affected a laugh, and cried, “My dear\r\nlord, sure you know us better than to talk of reasoning a young woman\r\nout of her inclinations? These inestimable jewels are as deaf as the\r\njewels they wear: time, my lord, time is the only medicine to cure\r\ntheir folly; but this is a medicine which I am certain she will not\r\ntake; nay, I live in hourly horrors on her account. In short, nothing\r\nbut violent methods will do.” “What is to be done?” cries my lord;\r\n“what methods are to be taken?--Is there any method upon earth?--Oh!\r\nLady Bellaston! there is nothing which I would not undertake for such\r\na reward.”----“I really know not,” answered the lady, after a pause;\r\nand then pausing again, she cried out--“Upon my soul, I am at my\r\nwit's end on this girl's account.--If she can be preserved, something\r\nmust be done immediately; and, as I say, nothing but violent methods\r\nwill do.----If your lordship hath really this attachment to my cousin\r\n(and to do her justice, except in this silly inclination, of which\r\nshe will soon see her folly, she is every way deserving), I think\r\nthere may be one way, indeed, it is a very disagreeable one, and what\r\nI am almost afraid to think of.--It requires a great spirit, I\r\npromise you.” “I am not conscious, madam,” said he, “of any defect\r\nthere; nor am I, I hope, suspected of any such. It must be an\r\negregious defect indeed, which could make me backward on this\r\noccasion.” “Nay, my lord,” answered she, “I am so far from doubting\r\nyou, I am much more inclined to doubt my own courage; for I must run\r\na monstrous risque. In short, I must place such a confidence in your\r\nhonour as a wise woman will scarce ever place in a man on any\r\nconsideration.” In this point likewise my lord very well satisfied\r\nher; for his reputation was extremely clear, and common fame did him\r\nno more than justice, in speaking well of him. “Well, then,” said\r\nshe, “my lord,--I--I vow, I can't bear the apprehension of it.--No,\r\nit must not be.----At least every other method shall be tried. Can\r\nyou get rid of your engagements, and dine here to-day? Your lordship\r\nwill have an opportunity of seeing a little more of Miss Western.--I\r\npromise you we have no time to lose. Here will be nobody but Lady\r\nBetty, and Miss Eagle, and Colonel Hampsted, and Tom Edwards; they\r\nwill all go soon--and I shall be at home to nobody. Then your\r\nlordship may be a little more explicit. Nay, I will contrive some\r\nmethod to convince you of her attachment to this fellow.” My lord\r\nmade proper compliments, accepted the invitation, and then they\r\nparted to dress, it being now past three in the morning, or to reckon\r\nby the old style, in the afternoon."

      "content": "A further explanation of the foregoing design.\r\n\nThough the reader may have long since concluded Lady Bellaston to be a\r\nmember (and no inconsiderable one) of the great world; she was in\r\nreality a very considerable member of the little world; by which\r\nappellation was distinguished a very worthy and honourable society\r\nwhich not long since flourished in this kingdom.\r\n\r\nAmong other good principles upon which this society was founded, there\r\nwas one very remarkable; for, as it was a rule of an honourable club\r\nof heroes, who assembled at the close of the late war, that all the\r\nmembers should every day fight once at least; so 'twas in this, that\r\nevery member should, within the twenty-four hours, tell at least one\r\nmerry fib, which was to be propagated by all the brethren and\r\nsisterhood.\r\n\r\nMany idle stories were told about this society, which from a certain\r\nquality may be, perhaps not unjustly, supposed to have come from the\r\nsociety themselves. As, that the devil was the president; and that he\r\nsat in person in an elbow-chair at the upper end of the table; but,\r\nupon very strict enquiry, I find there is not the least truth in any\r\nof those tales, and that the assembly consisted in reality of a set of\r\nvery good sort of people, and the fibs which they propagated were of a\r\nharmless kind, and tended only to produce mirth and good humour.\r\n\r\nEdwards was likewise a member of this comical society. To him\r\ntherefore Lady Bellaston applied as a proper instrument for her\r\npurpose, and furnished him with a fib, which he was to vent whenever\r\nthe lady gave him her cue; and this was not to be till the evening,\r\nwhen all the company but Lord Fellamar and himself were gone, and\r\nwhile they were engaged in a rubber at whist.\r\n\r\nTo this time then, which was between seven and eight in the evening,\r\nwe will convey our reader; when Lady Bellaston, Lord Fellamar, Miss\r\nWestern, and Tom, being engaged at whist, and in the last game of\r\ntheir rubbers, Tom received his cue from Lady Bellaston, which was, “I\r\nprotest, Tom, you are grown intolerable lately; you used to tell us\r\nall the news of the town, and now you know no more of the world than\r\nif you lived out of it.”\r\n\r\nMr Edwards then began as follows: “The fault is not mine, madam: it\r\nlies in the dulness of the age, that doth nothing worth talking\r\nof.----O la! though now I think on't there hath a terrible accident\r\nbefallen poor Colonel Wilcox.----Poor Ned.----You know him, my lord,\r\neverybody knows him; faith! I am very much concerned for him.”\r\n\r\n“What is it, pray?” says Lady Bellaston.\r\n\r\n“Why, he hath killed a man this morning in a duel, that's all.”\r\n\r\nHis lordship, who was not in the secret, asked gravely, whom he had\r\nkilled? To which Edwards answered, “A young fellow we none of us know;\r\na Somersetshire lad just came to town, one Jones his name is; a near\r\nrelation of one Mr Allworthy, of whom your lordship I believe hath\r\nheard. I saw the lad lie dead in a coffee-house.--Upon my soul, he is\r\none of the finest corpses I ever saw in my life!”\r\n\r\nSophia, who had just began to deal as Tom had mentioned that a man was\r\nkilled, stopt her hand, and listened with attention (for all stories\r\nof that kind affected her), but no sooner had he arrived at the latter\r\npart of the story than she began to deal again; and having dealt three\r\ncards to one, and seven to another, and ten to a third, at last dropt\r\nthe rest from her hand, and fell back in her chair.\r\n\r\nThe company behaved as usually on these occasions. The usual\r\ndisturbance ensued, the usual assistance was summoned, and Sophia at\r\nlast, as it is usual, returned again to life, and was soon after, at\r\nher earnest desire, led to her own apartment; where, at my lord's\r\nrequest, Lady Bellaston acquainted her with the truth, attempted to\r\ncarry it off as a jest of her own, and comforted her with repeated\r\nassurances, that neither his lordship nor Tom, though she had taught\r\nhim the story, were in the true secret of the affair.\r\n\r\nThere was no farther evidence necessary to convince Lord Fellamar how\r\njustly the case had been represented to him by Lady Bellaston; and\r\nnow, at her return into the room, a scheme was laid between these two\r\nnoble persons, which, though it appeared in no very heinous light to\r\nhis lordship (as he faithfully promised, and faithfully resolved too,\r\nto make the lady all the subsequent amends in his power by marriage),\r\nyet many of our readers, we doubt not, will see with just detestation.\r\n\r\nThe next evening at seven was appointed for the fatal purpose, when\r\nLady Bellaston undertook that Sophia should be alone, and his lordship\r\nshould be introduced to her. The whole family were to be regulated for\r\nthe purpose, most of the servants despatched out of the house; and for\r\nMrs Honour, who, to prevent suspicion, was to be left with her\r\nmistress till his lordship's arrival, Lady Bellaston herself was to\r\nengage her in an apartment as distant as possible from the scene of\r\nthe intended mischief, and out of the hearing of Sophia.\r\n\r\nMatters being thus agreed on, his lordship took his leave, and her\r\nladyship retired to rest, highly pleased with a project, of which she\r\nhad no reason to doubt the success, and which promised so effectually\r\nto remove Sophia from being any further obstruction to her amour with\r\nJones, by a means of which she should never appear to be guilty, even\r\nif the fact appeared to the world; but this she made no doubt of\r\npreventing by huddling up a marriage, to which she thought the\r\nravished Sophia would easily be brought to consent, and at which all\r\nthe rest of her family would rejoice.\r\n\r\nBut affairs were not in so quiet a situation in the bosom of the other\r\nconspirator; his mind was tost in all the distracting anxiety so nobly\r\ndescribed by Shakespear--\r\n\r\n “Between the acting of a dreadful thing,\r\n And the first motion, all the interim is\r\n Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream;\r\n The genius and the mortal instruments\r\n Are then in council; and the state of man,\r\n Like to a little kingdom, suffers then\r\n The nature of an insurrection.”----\r\n\r\nThough the violence of his passion had made him eagerly embrace the\r\nfirst hint of this design, especially as it came from a relation of\r\nthe lady, yet when that friend to reflection, a pillow, had placed the\r\naction itself in all its natural black colours before his eyes, with\r\nall the consequences which must, and those which might probably attend\r\nit, his resolution began to abate, or rather indeed to go over to the\r\nother side; and after a long conflict, which lasted a whole night,\r\nbetween honour and appetite, the former at length prevailed, and he\r\ndetermined to wait on Lady Bellaston, and to relinquish the design.\r\n\r\nLady Bellaston was in bed, though very late in the morning, and Sophia\r\nsitting by her bed-side, when the servant acquainted her that Lord\r\nFellamar was below in the parlour; upon which her ladyship desired him\r\nto stay, and that she would see him presently; but the servant was no\r\nsooner departed than poor Sophia began to intreat her cousin not to\r\nencourage the visits of that odious lord (so she called him, though a\r\nlittle unjustly) upon her account. “I see his design,” said she; “for\r\nhe made downright love to me yesterday morning; but as I am resolved\r\nnever to admit it, I beg your ladyship not to leave us alone together\r\nany more, and to order the servants that, if he enquires for me, I may\r\nbe always denied to him.”\r\n\r\n“La! child,” says Lady Bellaston, “you country girls have nothing but\r\nsweethearts in your head; you fancy every man who is civil to you is\r\nmaking love. He is one of the most gallant young fellows about town,\r\nand I am convinced means no more than a little gallantry. Make love to\r\nyou indeed! I wish with all my heart he would, and you must be an\r\narrant mad woman to refuse him.”\r\n\r\n“But as I shall certainly be that mad woman,” cries Sophia, “I hope\r\nhis visits shall not be intruded upon me.”\r\n\r\n“O child!” said Lady Bellaston, “you need not be so fearful; if you\r\nresolve to run away with that Jones, I know no person who can hinder\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Upon my honour, madam,” cries Sophia, “your ladyship injures me. I\r\nwill never run away with any man; nor will I ever marry contrary to my\r\nfather's inclinations.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Miss Western,” said the lady, “if you are not in a humour to\r\nsee company this morning, you may retire to your own apartment; for I\r\nam not frightened at his lordship, and must send for him up into my\r\ndressing-room.”\r\n\r\nSophia thanked her ladyship, and withdrew; and presently afterwards\r\nFellamar was admitted upstairs."

      "content": "By which it will appear how dangerous an advocate a lady is when she\r\napplies her eloquence to an ill purpose.\r\n\nWhen Lady Bellaston heard the young lord's scruples, she treated them\r\nwith the same disdain with which one of those sages of the law, called\r\nNewgate solicitors, treats the qualms of conscience in a young\r\nwitness. “My dear lord,” said she, “you certainly want a cordial. I\r\nmust send to Lady Edgely for one of her best drams. Fie upon it! have\r\nmore resolution. Are you frightened by the word rape? Or are you\r\napprehensive----? Well! if the story of Helen was modern, I should\r\nthink it unnatural. I mean the behaviour of Paris, not the fondness of\r\nthe lady; for all women love a man of spirit. There is another story\r\nof the Sabine ladies--and that too, I thank heaven, is very antient.\r\nYour lordship, perhaps, will admire my reading; but I think Mr Hook\r\ntells us, they made tolerable good wives afterwards. I fancy few of my\r\nmarried acquaintance were ravished by their husbands.” “Nay, dear Lady\r\nBellaston,” cried he, “don't ridicule me in this manner.” “Why, my\r\ngood lord,” answered she, “do you think any woman in England would not\r\nlaugh at you in her heart, whatever prudery she might wear in her\r\ncountenance?----You force me to use a strange kind of language, and to\r\nbetray my sex most abominably; but I am contented with knowing my\r\nintentions are good, and that I am endeavouring to serve my cousin;\r\nfor I think you will make her a husband notwithstanding this; or, upon\r\nmy soul, I would not even persuade her to fling herself away upon an\r\nempty title. She should not upbraid me hereafter with having lost a\r\nman of spirit; for that his enemies allow this poor young fellow to\r\nbe.”\r\n\r\nLet those who have had the satisfaction of hearing reflections of this\r\nkind from a wife or a mistress, declare whether they are at all\r\nsweetened by coming from a female tongue. Certain it is, they sunk\r\ndeeper into his lordship than anything which Demosthenes or Cicero\r\ncould have said on the occasion.\r\n\r\nLady Bellaston, perceiving she had fired the young lord's pride, began\r\nnow, like a true orator, to rouse other passions to its assistance.\r\n“My lord,” says she, in a graver voice, “you will be pleased to\r\nremember, you mentioned this matter to me first; for I would not\r\nappear to you in the light of one who is endeavouring to put off my\r\ncousin upon you. Fourscore thousand pounds do not stand in need of an\r\nadvocate to recommend them.” “Nor doth Miss Western,” said he,\r\n“require any recommendation from her fortune; for, in my opinion, no\r\nwoman ever had half her charms.” “Yes, yes, my lord,” replied the\r\nlady, looking in the glass, “there have been women with more than half\r\nher charms, I assure you; not that I need lessen her on that account:\r\nshe is a most delicious girl, that's certain; and within these few\r\nhours she will be in the arms of one, who surely doth not deserve her,\r\nthough I will give him his due, I believe he is truly a man of\r\nspirit.”\r\n\r\n“I hope so, madam,” said my lord; “though I must own he doth not\r\ndeserve her; for, unless heaven or your ladyship disappoint me, she\r\nshall within that time be in mine.”\r\n\r\n“Well spoken, my lord,” answered the lady; “I promise you no\r\ndisappointment shall happen from my side; and within this week I am\r\nconvinced I shall call your lordship my cousin in public.”\r\n\r\nThe remainder of this scene consisted entirely of raptures, excuses,\r\nand compliments, very pleasant to have heard from the parties; but\r\nrather dull when related at second hand. Here, therefore, we shall put\r\nan end to this dialogue, and hasten to the fatal hour when everything\r\nwas prepared for the destruction of poor Sophia.\r\n\r\nBut this being the most tragical matter in our whole history, we shall\r\ntreat it in a chapter by itself."

      "content": "Containing some matters which may affect, and others which may\r\nsurprize, the reader.\r\n\nThe clock had now struck seven, and poor Sophia, alone and melancholy,\r\nsat reading a tragedy. It was the Fatal Marriage; and she was now come\r\nto that part where the poor distrest Isabella disposes of her\r\nwedding-ring.\r\n\r\nHere the book dropt from her hand, and a shower of tears ran down into\r\nher bosom. In this situation she had continued a minute, when the door\r\nopened, and in came Lord Fellamar. Sophia started from her chair at\r\nhis entrance; and his lordship advancing forwards, and making a low\r\nbow, said, “I am afraid, Miss Western, I break in upon you abruptly.”\r\n “Indeed, my lord,” says she, “I must own myself a little surprized at\r\nthis unexpected visit.” “If this visit be unexpected, madam,” answered\r\nLord Fellamar, “my eyes must have been very faithless interpreters of\r\nmy heart, when last I had the honour of seeing you; for surely you\r\ncould not otherwise have hoped to detain my heart in your possession,\r\nwithout receiving a visit from its owner.” Sophia, confused as she\r\nwas, answered this bombast (and very properly I think) with a look of\r\ninconceivable disdain. My lord then made another and a longer speech\r\nof the same sort. Upon which Sophia, trembling, said, “Am I really to\r\nconceive your lordship to be out of your senses? Sure, my lord, there\r\nis no other excuse for such behaviour.” “I am, indeed, madam, in the\r\nsituation you suppose,” cries his lordship; “and sure you will pardon\r\nthe effects of a frenzy which you yourself have occasioned; for love\r\nhath so totally deprived me of reason, that I am scarce accountable\r\nfor any of my actions.” “Upon my word, my lord,” said Sophia, “I\r\nneither understand your words nor your behaviour.” “Suffer me then,\r\nmadam,” cries he, “at your feet to explain both, by laying open my\r\nsoul to you, and declaring that I doat on you to the highest degree of\r\ndistraction. O most adorable, most divine creature! what language can\r\nexpress the sentiments of my heart?” “I do assure you, my lord,” said\r\nSophia, “I shall not stay to hear any more of this.” “Do not,” cries\r\nhe, “think of leaving me thus cruelly; could you know half the\r\ntorments which I feel, that tender bosom must pity what those eyes\r\nhave caused.” Then fetching a deep sigh, and laying hold of her hand,\r\nhe ran on for some minutes in a strain which would be little more\r\npleasing to the reader than it was to the lady; and at last concluded\r\nwith a declaration, “That if he was master of the world, he would lay\r\nit at her feet.” Sophia then, forcibly pulling away her hand from his,\r\nanswered with much spirit, “I promise you, sir, your world and its\r\nmaster I should spurn from me with equal contempt.” She then offered\r\nto go; and Lord Fellamar, again laying hold of her hand, said, “Pardon\r\nme, my beloved angel, freedoms which nothing but despair could have\r\ntempted me to take.----Believe me, could I have had any hope that my\r\ntitle and fortune, neither of them inconsiderable, unless when\r\ncompared with your worth, would have been accepted, I had, in the\r\nhumblest manner, presented them to your acceptance.----But I cannot\r\nlose you.--By heaven, I will sooner part with my soul!--You are, you\r\nmust, you shall be only mine.” “My lord,” says she, “I intreat you to\r\ndesist from a vain pursuit; for, upon my honour, I will never hear you\r\non this subject. Let go my hand, my lord; for I am resolved to go from\r\nyou this moment; nor will I ever see you more.” “Then, madam,” cries\r\nhis lordship, “I must make the best use of this moment; for I cannot\r\nlive, nor will I live without you.”----“What do you mean, my lord?”\r\n said Sophia; “I will raise the family.” “I have no fear, madam,”\r\n answered he, “but of losing you, and that I am resolved to prevent,\r\nthe only way which despair points to me.”--He then caught her in his\r\narms: upon which she screamed so loud, that she must have alarmed some\r\none to her assistance, had not Lady Bellaston taken care to remove all\r\nears.\r\n\r\nBut a more lucky circumstance happened for poor Sophia; another noise\r\nnow broke forth, which almost drowned her cries; for now the whole\r\nhouse rang with, “Where is she? D--n me, I'll unkennel her this\r\ninstant. Show me her chamber, I say. Where is my daughter? I know\r\nshe's in the house, and I'll see her if she's above-ground. Show me\r\nwhere she is.”--At which last words the door flew open, and in came\r\nSquire Western, with his parson and a set of myrmidons at his heels.\r\n\r\nHow miserable must have been the condition of poor Sophia, when the\r\nenraged voice of her father was welcome to her ears! Welcome indeed it\r\nwas, and luckily did he come; for it was the only accident upon earth\r\nwhich could have preserved the peace of her mind from being for ever\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nSophia, notwithstanding her fright, presently knew her father's voice;\r\nand his lordship, notwithstanding his passion, knew the voice of\r\nreason, which peremptorily assured him, it was not now a time for the\r\nperpetration of his villany. Hearing, therefore, the voice approach,\r\nand hearing likewise whose it was (for as the squire more than once\r\nroared forth the word daughter, so Sophia, in the midst of her\r\nstruggling, cried out upon her father), he thought proper to\r\nrelinquish his prey, having only disordered her handkerchief, and with\r\nhis rude lips committed violence on her lovely neck.\r\n\r\nIf the reader's imagination doth not assist me, I shall never be able\r\nto describe the situation of these two persons when Western came into\r\nthe room. Sophia tottered into a chair, where she sat disordered,\r\npale, breathless, bursting with indignation at Lord Fellamar;\r\naffrighted, and yet more rejoiced, at the arrival of her father.\r\n\r\nHis lordship sat down near her, with the bag of his wig hanging over\r\none of his shoulders, the rest of his dress being somewhat disordered,\r\nand rather a greater proportion of linen than is usual appearing at\r\nhis bosom. As to the rest, he was amazed, affrighted, vexed, and\r\nashamed.\r\n\r\nAs to Squire Western, he happened at this time to be overtaken by an\r\nenemy, which very frequently pursues, and seldom fails to overtake,\r\nmost of the country gentlemen in this kingdom. He was, literally\r\nspeaking, drunk; which circumstance, together with his natural\r\nimpetuosity, could produce no other effect than his running\r\nimmediately up to his daughter, upon whom he fell foul with his tongue\r\nin the most inveterate manner; nay, he had probably committed violence\r\nwith his hands, had not the parson interposed, saying, “For heaven's\r\nsake, sir, animadvert that you are in the house of a great lady. Let\r\nme beg you to mitigate your wrath; it should minister a fulness of\r\nsatisfaction that you have found your daughter; for as to revenge, it\r\nbelongeth not unto us. I discern great contrition in the countenance\r\nof the young lady. I stand assured, if you will forgive her, she will\r\nrepent her of all past offences, and return unto her duty.”\r\n\r\nThe strength of the parson's arms had at first been of more service\r\nthan the strength of his rhetoric. However, his last words wrought\r\nsome effect, and the squire answered, “I'll forgee her if she wull ha\r\nun. If wot ha un, Sophy, I'll forgee thee all. Why dost unt speak?\r\nShat ha un! d--n me, shat ha un! Why dost unt answer? Was ever such a\r\nstubborn tuoad?”\r\n\r\n“Let me intreat you, sir, to be a little more moderate,” said the\r\nparson; “you frighten the young lady so, that you deprive her of all\r\npower of utterance.”\r\n\r\n“Power of mine a--,” answered the squire. “You take her part then,\r\nyou do? A pretty parson, truly, to side with an undutiful child! Yes,\r\nyes, I will gee you a living with a pox. I'll gee un to the devil\r\nsooner.”\r\n\r\n“I humbly crave your pardon,” said the parson; “I assure your worship\r\nI meant no such matter.”\r\n\r\nMy Lady Bellaston now entered the room, and came up to the squire, who\r\nno sooner saw her, than, resolving to follow the instructions of his\r\nsister, he made her a very civil bow, in the rural manner, and paid\r\nher some of his best compliments. He then immediately proceeded to his\r\ncomplaints, and said, “There, my lady cousin; there stands the most\r\nundutiful child in the world; she hankers after a beggarly rascal, and\r\nwon't marry one of the greatest matches in all England, that we have\r\nprovided for her.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, cousin Western,” answered the lady, “I am persuaded you wrong\r\nmy cousin. I am sure she hath a better understanding. I am convinced\r\nshe will not refuse what she must be sensible is so much to her\r\nadvantage.”\r\n\r\nThis was a wilful mistake in Lady Bellaston, for she well knew whom Mr\r\nWestern meant; though perhaps she thought he would easily be\r\nreconciled to his lordship's proposals.\r\n\r\n“Do you hear there,” quoth the squire, “what her ladyship says? All\r\nyour family are for the match. Come, Sophy, be a good girl, and be\r\ndutiful, and make your father happy.”\r\n\r\n“If my death will make you happy, sir,” answered Sophia, “you will\r\nshortly be so.”\r\n\r\n“It's a lye, Sophy; it's a d--n'd lye, and you know it,” said the\r\nsquire.\r\n\r\n“Indeed, Miss Western,” said Lady Bellaston, “you injure your father;\r\nhe hath nothing in view but your interest in this match; and I and all\r\nyour friends must acknowledge the highest honour done to your family\r\nin the proposal.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, all of us,” quoth the squire; “nay, it was no proposal of mine.\r\nShe knows it was her aunt proposed it to me first.--Come, Sophy, once\r\nmore let me beg you to be a good girl, and gee me your consent before\r\nyour cousin.”\r\n\r\n“Let me give him your hand, cousin,” said the lady. “It is the fashion\r\nnow-a-days to dispense with time and long courtships.”\r\n\r\n“Pugh!” said the squire, “what signifies time; won't they have time\r\nenough to court afterwards? People may court very well after they have\r\nbeen a-bed together.”\r\n\r\nAs Lord Fellamar was very well assured that he was meant by Lady\r\nBellaston, so, never having heard nor suspected a word of Blifil, he\r\nmade no doubt of his being meant by the father. Coming up, therefore,\r\nto the squire, he said, “Though I have not the honour, sir, of being\r\npersonally known to you, yet, as I find I have the happiness to have\r\nmy proposals accepted, let me intercede, sir, in behalf of the young\r\nlady, that she may not be more solicited at this time.”\r\n\r\n“You intercede, sir!” said the squire; “why, who the devil are you?”\r\n\r\n“Sir, I am Lord Fellamar,” answered he, “and am the happy man whom I\r\nhope you have done the honour of accepting for a son-in-law.”\r\n\r\n“You are a son of a b----,” replied the squire, “for all your laced\r\ncoat. You my son-in-law, and be d--n'd to you!”\r\n\r\n“I shall take more from you, sir, than from any man,” answered the\r\nlord; “but I must inform you that I am not used to hear such language\r\nwithout resentment.”\r\n\r\n“Resent my a--,” quoth the squire. “Don't think I am afraid of such a\r\nfellow as thee art! because hast got a spit there dangling at thy\r\nside. Lay by your spit, and I'll give thee enough of meddling with\r\nwhat doth not belong to thee. I'll teach you to father-in-law me. I'll\r\nlick thy jacket.”\r\n\r\n“It's very well, sir,” said my lord, “I shall make no disturbance\r\nbefore the ladies. I am very well satisfied. Your humble servant, sir;\r\nLady Bellaston, your most obedient.”\r\n\r\nHis lordship was no sooner gone, than Lady Bellaston, coming up to Mr\r\nWestern, said, “Bless me, sir, what have you done? You know not whom\r\nyou have affronted; he is a nobleman of the first rank and fortune,\r\nand yesterday made proposals to your daughter; and such as I am sure\r\nyou must accept with the highest pleasure.”\r\n\r\n“Answer for yourself, lady cousin,” said the squire, “I will have\r\nnothing to do with any of your lords. My daughter shall have an honest\r\ncountry gentleman; I have pitched upon one for her--and she shall ha'\r\nun.--I am sorry for the trouble she hath given your ladyship with all\r\nmy heart.” Lady Bellaston made a civil speech upon the word trouble;\r\nto which the squire answered--“Why, that's kind--and I would do as\r\nmuch for your ladyship. To be sure relations should do for one\r\nanother. So I wish your ladyship a good night.--Come, madam, you must\r\ngo along with me by fair means, or I'll have you carried down to the\r\ncoach.”\r\n\r\nSophia said she would attend him without force; but begged to go in a\r\nchair, for she said she should not be able to ride any other way.\r\n\r\n“Prithee,” cries the squire, “wout unt persuade me canst not ride in a\r\ncoach, wouldst? That's a pretty thing surely! No, no, I'll never let\r\nthee out of my sight any more till art married, that I promise thee.”\r\n Sophia told him, she saw he was resolved to break her heart. “O break\r\nthy heart and be d--n'd,” quoth he, “if a good husband will break it.\r\nI don't value a brass varden, not a halfpenny, of any undutiful b--\r\nupon earth.” He then took violent hold of her hand; upon which the\r\nparson once more interfered, begging him to use gentle methods. At\r\nthat the squire thundered out a curse, and bid the parson hold his\r\ntongue, saying, “At'nt in pulpit now? when art a got up there I never\r\nmind what dost say; but I won't be priest-ridden, nor taught how to\r\nbehave myself by thee. I wish your ladyship a good-night. Come along,\r\nSophy; be a good girl, and all shall be well. Shat ha' un, d--n me,\r\nshat ha' un!”\r\n\r\nMrs Honour appeared below-stairs, and with a low curtesy to the squire\r\noffered to attend her mistress; but he pushed her away, saying, “Hold,\r\nmadam, hold, you come no more near my house.” “And will you take my\r\nmaid away from me?” said Sophia. “Yes, indeed, madam, will I,” cries\r\nthe squire: “you need not fear being without a servant; I will get you\r\nanother maid, and a better maid than this, who, I'd lay five pounds to\r\na crown, is no more a maid than my grannum. No, no, Sophy, she shall\r\ncontrive no more escapes, I promise you.” He then packed up his\r\ndaughter and the parson into the hackney coach, after which he mounted\r\nhimself, and ordered it to drive to his lodgings. In the way thither\r\nhe suffered Sophia to be quiet, and entertained himself with reading a\r\nlecture to the parson on good manners, and a proper behaviour to his\r\nbetters.\r\n\r\nIt is possible he might not so easily have carried off his daughter\r\nfrom Lady Bellaston, had that good lady desired to have detained her;\r\nbut, in reality, she was not a little pleased with the confinement\r\ninto which Sophia was going; and as her project with Lord Fellamar had\r\nfailed of success, she was well contented that other violent methods\r\nwere now going to be used in favour of another man."

      "content": "By what means the squire came to discover his daughter.\r\n\nThough the reader, in many histories, is obliged to digest much more\r\nunaccountable appearances than this of Mr Western, without any\r\nsatisfaction at all; yet, as we dearly love to oblige him whenever it\r\nis in our power, we shall now proceed to shew by what method the\r\nsquire discovered where his daughter was.\r\n\r\nIn the third chapter, then, of the preceding book, we gave a hint (for\r\nit is not our custom to unfold at any time more than is necessary for\r\nthe occasion) that Mrs Fitzpatrick, who was very desirous of\r\nreconciling her uncle and aunt Western, thought she had a probable\r\nopportunity, by the service of preserving Sophia from committing the\r\nsame crime which had drawn on herself the anger of her family. After\r\nmuch deliberation, therefore, she resolved to inform her aunt Western\r\nwhere her cousin was, and accordingly she writ the following letter,\r\nwhich we shall give the reader at length, for more reasons than one.\r\n\r\n “HONOURED MADAM,\r\n\r\n “The occasion of my writing this will perhaps make a letter of mine\r\n agreeable to my dear aunt, for the sake of one of her nieces, though\r\n I have little reason to hope it will be so on the account of\r\n another.\r\n\r\n “Without more apology, as I was coming to throw my unhappy self at\r\n your feet, I met, by the strangest accident in the world, my cousin\r\n Sophy, whose history you are better acquainted with than myself,\r\n though, alas! I know infinitely too much; enough indeed to satisfy\r\n me, that unless she is immediately prevented, she is in danger of\r\n running into the same fatal mischief, which, by foolishly and\r\n ignorantly refusing your most wise and prudent advice, I have\r\n unfortunately brought on myself.\r\n\r\n “In short, I have seen the man, nay, I was most part of yesterday in\r\n his company, and a charming young fellow I promise you he is. By\r\n what accident he came acquainted with me is too tedious to tell you\r\n now; but I have this morning changed my lodgings to avoid him, lest\r\n he should by my means discover my cousin; for he doth not yet know\r\n where she is, and it is adviseable he should not, till my uncle hath\r\n secured her.----No time therefore is to be lost; and I need only\r\n inform you, that she is now with Lady Bellaston, whom I have seen,\r\n and who hath, I find, a design of concealing her from her family.\r\n You know, madam, she is a strange woman; but nothing could misbecome\r\n me more than to presume to give any hint to one of your great\r\n understanding and great knowledge of the world, besides barely\r\n informing you of the matter of fact.\r\n\r\n “I hope, madam, the care which I have shewn on this occasion for the\r\n good of my family will recommend me again to the favour of a lady\r\n who hath always exerted so much zeal for the honour and true\r\n interest of us all; and that it may be a means of restoring me to\r\n your friendship, which hath made so great a part of my former, and\r\n is so necessary to my future happiness.\r\n\r\n “I am,\r\n with the utmost respect,\r\n honoured madam,\r\n your most dutiful obliged niece,\r\n and most obedient humble\r\n servant,\r\n HARRIET FITZPATRICK.”\r\n\r\nMrs Western was now at her brother's house, where she had resided ever\r\nsince the flight of Sophia, in order to administer comfort to the poor\r\nsquire in his affliction. Of this comfort, which she doled out to him\r\nin daily portions, we have formerly given a specimen.\r\n\r\nShe was now standing with her back to the fire, and, with a pinch of\r\nsnuff in her hand, was dealing forth this daily allowance of comfort\r\nto the squire, while he smoaked his afternoon pipe, when she received\r\nthe above letter; which she had no sooner read than she delivered it\r\nto him, saying, “There, sir, there is an account of your lost sheep.\r\nFortune hath again restored her to you, and if you will be governed by\r\nmy advice, it is possible you may yet preserve her.”\r\n\r\nThe squire had no sooner read the letter than he leaped from his\r\nchair, threw his pipe into the fire, and gave a loud huzza for joy. He\r\nthen summoned his servants, called for his boots, and ordered the\r\nChevalier and several other horses to be saddled, and that parson\r\nSupple should be immediately sent for. Having done this, he turned to\r\nhis sister, caught her in his arms, and gave her a close embrace,\r\nsaying, “Zounds! you don't seem pleased; one would imagine you was\r\nsorry I have found the girl.”\r\n\r\n“Brother,” answered she, “the deepest politicians, who see to the\r\nbottom, discover often a very different aspect of affairs, from what\r\nswims on the surface. It is true, indeed, things do look rather less\r\ndesperate than they did formerly in Holland, when Lewis the Fourteenth\r\nwas at the gates of Amsterdam; but there is a delicacy required in\r\nthis matter, which you will pardon me, brother, if I suspect you want.\r\nThere is a decorum to be used with a woman of figure, such as Lady\r\nBellaston, brother, which requires a knowledge of the world, superior,\r\nI am afraid, to yours.”\r\n\r\n“Sister,” cries the squire, “I know you have no opinion of my parts;\r\nbut I'll shew you on this occasion who is a fool. Knowledge, quotha! I\r\nhave not been in the country so long without having some knowledge of\r\nwarrants and the law of the land. I know I may take my own wherever I\r\ncan find it. Shew me my own daughter, and if I don't know how to come\r\nat her, I'll suffer you to call me a fool as long as I live. There be\r\njustices of peace in London, as well as in other places.”\r\n\r\n“I protest,” cries she, “you make me tremble for the event of this\r\nmatter, which, if you will proceed by my advice, you may bring to so\r\ngood an issue. Do you really imagine, brother, that the house of a\r\nwoman of figure is to be attacked by warrants and brutal justices of\r\nthe peace? I will inform you how to proceed. As soon as you arrive in\r\ntown, and have got yourself into a decent dress (for indeed, brother,\r\nyou have none at present fit to appear in), you must send your\r\ncompliments to Lady Bellaston, and desire leave to wait on her. When\r\nyou are admitted to her presence, as you certainly will be, and have\r\ntold her your story, and have made proper use of my name (for I think\r\nyou just know one another only by sight, though you are relations), I\r\nam confident she will withdraw her protection from my niece, who hath\r\ncertainly imposed upon her. This is the only method.--Justices of\r\npeace, indeed! do you imagine any such event can arrive to a woman of\r\nfigure in a civilised nation?”\r\n\r\n“D--n their figures,” cries the squire; “a pretty civilised nation,\r\ntruly, where women are above the law. And what must I stand sending a\r\nparcel of compliments to a confounded whore, that keeps away a\r\ndaughter from her own natural father? I tell you, sister, I am not so\r\nignorant as you think me----I know you would have women above the law,\r\nbut it is all a lye; I heard his lordship say at size, that no one is\r\nabove the law. But this of yours is Hanover law, I suppose.”\r\n\r\n“Mr Western,” said she, “I think you daily improve in ignorance.----I\r\nprotest you are grown an arrant bear.”\r\n\r\n“No more a bear than yourself, sister Western,” said the\r\nsquire.--“Pox! you may talk of your civility an you will, I am sure\r\nyou never shew any to me. I am no bear, no, nor no dog neither, though\r\nI know somebody, that is something that begins with a b; but pox! I\r\nwill show you I have got more good manners than some folks.”\r\n\r\n“Mr Western,” answered the lady, “you may say what you please, _je\r\nvous mesprise de tout mon coeur._ I shall not therefore be\r\nangry.----Besides, as my cousin, with that odious Irish name, justly\r\nsays, I have that regard for the honour and true interest of my\r\nfamily, and that concern for my niece, who is a part of it, that I\r\nhave resolved to go to town myself upon this occasion; for indeed,\r\nindeed, brother, you are not a fit minister to be employed at a polite\r\ncourt.--Greenland--Greenland should always be the scene of the\r\ntramontane negociation.”\r\n\r\n“I thank Heaven,” cries the squire, “I don't understand you now. You\r\nare got to your Hanoverian linguo. However, I'll shew you I scorn to\r\nbe behind-hand in civility with you; and as you are not angry for what\r\nI have said, so I am not angry for what you have said. Indeed I have\r\nalways thought it a folly for relations to quarrel; and if they do now\r\nand then give a hasty word, why, people should give and take; for my\r\npart, I never bear malice; and I take it very kind of you to go up to\r\nLondon; for I never was there but twice in my life, and then I did not\r\nstay above a fortnight at a time, and to be sure I can't be expected\r\nto know much of the streets and the folks in that time. I never denied\r\nthat you know'd all these matters better than I. For me to dispute\r\nthat would be all as one as for you to dispute the management of a\r\npack of dogs, or the finding a hare sitting, with me.”--“Which I\r\npromise you,” says she, “I never will.”--“Well, and I promise you,”\r\n returned he, “that I never will dispute the t'other.”\r\n\r\nHere then a league was struck (to borrow a phrase from the lady)\r\nbetween the contending parties; and now the parson arriving, and the\r\nhorses being ready, the squire departed, having promised his sister to\r\nfollow her advice, and she prepared to follow him the next day.\r\n\r\nBut having communicated these matters to the parson on the road, they\r\nboth agreed that the prescribed formalities might very well be\r\ndispensed with; and the squire, having changed his mind, proceeded in\r\nthe manner we have already seen."

      "content": "In which various misfortunes befel poor Jones.\r\n\nAffairs were in the aforesaid situation when Mrs Honour arrived at Mrs\r\nMiller's, and called Jones out from the company, as we have before\r\nseen, with whom, when she found herself alone, she began as follows:--\r\n\r\n“O, my dear sir! how shall I get spirits to tell you; you are undone,\r\nsir, and my poor lady's undone, and I am undone.” “Hath anything\r\nhappened to Sophia?” cries Jones, staring like a madman. “All that is\r\nbad,” cries Honour: “Oh, I shall never get such another lady! Oh that\r\nI should ever live to see this day!” At these words Jones turned pale\r\nas ashes, trembled, and stammered; but Honour went on--“O! Mr Jones, I\r\nhave lost my lady for ever.” “How? what! for Heaven's sake, tell me.\r\nO, my dear Sophia!” “You may well call her so,” said Honour; “she was\r\nthe dearest lady to me. I shall never have such another\r\nplace.”----“D--n your place!” cries Jones; “where is--what--what is\r\nbecome of my Sophia?” “Ay, to be sure,” cries she, “servants may be\r\nd--n'd. It signifies nothing what becomes of them, though they are\r\nturned away, and ruined ever so much. To be sure they are not flesh\r\nand blood like other people. No, to be sure, it signifies nothing what\r\nbecomes of them.” “If you have any pity, any compassion,” cries Jones,\r\n“I beg you will instantly tell me what hath happened to Sophia?” “To\r\nbe sure, I have more pity for you than you have for me,” answered\r\nHonour; “I don't d--n you because you have lost the sweetest lady in\r\nthe world. To be sure you are worthy to be pitied, and I am worthy to\r\nbe pitied too: for, to be sure, if ever there was a good mistress----”\r\n “What hath happened?” cries Jones, in almost a raving fit.\r\n“What?--What?” said Honour: “Why, the worst that could have happened\r\nboth for you and for me.--Her father is come to town, and hath carried\r\nher away from us both.” Here Jones fell on his knees in thanksgiving\r\nthat it was no worse. “No worse!” repeated Honour; “what could be\r\nworse for either of us? He carried her off, swearing she should marry\r\nMr Blifil; that's for your comfort; and, for poor me, I am turned out\r\nof doors.” “Indeed, Mrs Honour,” answered Jones, “you frightened me\r\nout of my wits. I imagined some most dreadful sudden accident had\r\nhappened to Sophia; something, compared to which, even seeing her\r\nmarried to Blifil would be a trifle; but while there is life there are\r\nhopes, my dear Honour. Women in this land of liberty, cannot be\r\nmarried by actual brutal force.” “To be sure, sir,” said she, “that's\r\ntrue. There may be some hopes for you; but alack-a-day! what hopes are\r\nthere for poor me? And to be sure, sir, you must be sensible I suffer\r\nall this upon your account. All the quarrel the squire hath to me is\r\nfor taking your part, as I have done, against Mr Blifil.” “Indeed, Mrs\r\nHonour,” answered he, “I am sensible of my obligations to you, and\r\nwill leave nothing in my power undone to make you amends.” “Alas!\r\nsir,” said she, “what can make a servant amends for the loss of one\r\nplace but the getting another altogether as good?” “Do not despair,\r\nMrs Honour,” said Jones, “I hope to reinstate you again in the same.”\r\n “Alack-a-day, sir,” said she, “how can I flatter myself with such\r\nhopes when I know it is a thing impossible? for the squire is so set\r\nagainst me: and yet, if you should ever have my lady, as to be sure I\r\nnow hopes heartily you will; for you are a generous, good-natured\r\ngentleman; and I am sure you loves her, and to be sure she loves you\r\nas dearly as her own soul; it is a matter in vain to deny it; because\r\nas why, everybody, that is in the least acquainted with my lady, must\r\nsee it; for, poor dear lady, she can't dissemble: and if two people\r\nwho loves one another a'n't happy, why who should be so? Happiness\r\ndon't always depend upon what people has; besides, my lady has enough\r\nfor both. To be sure, therefore, as one may say, it would be all the\r\npity in the world to keep two such loviers asunder; nay, I am\r\nconvinced, for my part, you will meet together at last; for, if it is\r\nto be, there is no preventing it. If a marriage is made in heaven, all\r\nthe justices of peace upon earth can't break it off. To be sure I\r\nwishes that parson Supple had but a little more spirit, to tell the\r\nsquire of his wickedness in endeavouring to force his daughter\r\ncontrary to her liking; but then his whole dependance is on the\r\nsquire; and so the poor gentleman, though he is a very religious good\r\nsort of man, and talks of the badness of such doings behind the\r\nsquire's back, yet he dares not say his soul is his own to his face.\r\nTo be sure I never saw him make so bold as just now; I was afeard the\r\nsquire would have struck him. I would not have your honour be\r\nmelancholy, sir, nor despair; things may go better, as long as you are\r\nsure of my lady, and that I am certain you may be; for she never will\r\nbe brought to consent to marry any other man. Indeed I am terribly\r\nafeared the squire will do her a mischief in his passion, for he is a\r\nprodigious passionate gentleman; and I am afeared too the poor lady\r\nwill be brought to break her heart, for she is as tender-hearted as a\r\nchicken. It is pity, methinks, she had not a little of my courage. If\r\nI was in love with a young man, and my father offered to lock me up,\r\nI'd tear his eyes out but I'd come at him; but then there's a great\r\nfortune in the case, which it is in her father's power either to give\r\nher or not; that, to be sure, may make some difference.”\r\n\r\nWhether Jones gave strict attention to all the foregoing harangue, or\r\nwhether it was for want of any vacancy in the discourse, I cannot\r\ndetermine; but he never once attempted to answer, nor did she once\r\nstop till Partridge came running into the room, and informed him that\r\nthe great lady was upon the stairs.\r\n\r\nNothing could equal the dilemma to which Jones was now reduced. Honour\r\nknew nothing of any acquaintance that subsisted between him and Lady\r\nBellaston, and she was almost the last person in the world to whom he\r\nwould have communicated it. In this hurry and distress, he took (as is\r\ncommon enough) the worst course, and, instead of exposing her to the\r\nlady, which would have been of little consequence, he chose to expose\r\nthe lady to her; he therefore resolved to hide Honour, whom he had but\r\njust time to convey behind the bed, and to draw the curtains.\r\n\r\nThe hurry in which Jones had been all day engaged on account of his\r\npoor landlady and her family, the terrors occasioned by Mrs Honour,\r\nand the confusion into which he was thrown by the sudden arrival of\r\nLady Bellaston, had altogether driven former thoughts out of his head;\r\nso that it never once occurred to his memory to act the part of a sick\r\nman; which, indeed, neither the gaiety of his dress, nor the freshness\r\nof his countenance, would have at all supported.\r\n\r\nHe received her ladyship therefore rather agreeably to her desires\r\nthan to her expectations, with all the good humour he could muster in\r\nhis countenance, and without any real or affected appearance of the\r\nleast disorder.\r\n\r\nLady Bellaston no sooner entered the room, than she squatted herself\r\ndown on the bed: “So, my dear Jones,” said she, “you find nothing can\r\ndetain me long from you. Perhaps I ought to be angry with you, that I\r\nhave neither seen nor heard from you all day; for I perceive your\r\ndistemper would have suffered you to come abroad: nay, I suppose you\r\nhave not sat in your chamber all day drest up like a fine lady to see\r\ncompany after a lying-in; but, however, don't think I intend to scold\r\nyou; for I never will give you an excuse for the cold behaviour of a\r\nhusband, by putting on the ill-humour of a wife.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, Lady Bellaston,” said Jones, “I am sure your ladyship will not\r\nupbraid me with neglect of duty, when I only waited for orders. Who,\r\nmy dear creature, hath reason to complain? Who missed an appointment\r\nlast night, and left an unhappy man to expect, and wish, and sigh, and\r\nlanguish?”\r\n\r\n“Do not mention it, my dear Mr Jones,” cried she. “If you knew the\r\noccasion, you would pity me. In short, it is impossible to conceive\r\nwhat women of condition are obliged to suffer from the impertinence of\r\nfools, in order to keep up the farce of the world. I am glad, however,\r\nall your languishing and wishing have done you no harm; for you never\r\nlooked better in your life. Upon my faith! Jones, you might at this\r\ninstant sit for the picture of Adonis.”\r\n\r\nThere are certain words of provocation which men of honour hold can\r\nproperly be answered only by a blow. Among lovers possibly there may\r\nbe some expressions which can be answered only by a kiss. Now the\r\ncompliment which Lady Bellaston now made Jones seems to be of this\r\nkind, especially as it was attended with a look, in which the lady\r\nconveyed more soft ideas than it was possible to express with her\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\nJones was certainly at this instant in one of the most disagreeable\r\nand distressed situations imaginable; for, to carry on the comparison\r\nwe made use of before, though the provocation was given by the lady,\r\nJones could not receive satisfaction, nor so much as offer to ask it,\r\nin the presence of a third person; seconds in this kind of duels not\r\nbeing according to the law of arms. As this objection did not occur to\r\nLady Bellaston, who was ignorant of any other woman being there but\r\nherself, she waited some time in great astonishment for an answer from\r\nJones, who, conscious of the ridiculous figure he made, stood at a\r\ndistance, and, not daring to give the proper answer, gave none at all.\r\nNothing can be imagined more comic, nor yet more tragical, than this\r\nscene would have been if it had lasted much longer. The lady had\r\nalready changed colour two or three times; had got up from the bed and\r\nsat down again, while Jones was wishing the ground to sink under him,\r\nor the house to fall on his head, when an odd accident freed him from\r\nan embarrassment out of which neither the eloquence of a Cicero, nor\r\nthe politics of a Machiavel, could have delivered him, without utter\r\ndisgrace.\r\n\r\nThis was no other than the arrival of young Nightingale, dead drunk;\r\nor rather in that state of drunkenness which deprives men of the use\r\nof their reason without depriving them of the use of their limbs.\r\n\r\nMrs Miller and her daughters were in bed, and Partridge was smoaking\r\nhis pipe by the kitchen fire; so that he arrived at Mr Jones's\r\nchamber-door without any interruption. This he burst open, and was\r\nentering without any ceremony, when Jones started from his seat and\r\nran to oppose him, which he did so effectually, that Nightingale never\r\ncame far enough within the door to see who was sitting on the bed.\r\n\r\nNightingale had in reality mistaken Jones's apartment for that in\r\nwhich himself had lodged; he therefore strongly insisted on coming in,\r\noften swearing that he would not be kept from his own bed. Jones,\r\nhowever, prevailed over him, and delivered him into the hands of\r\nPartridge, whom the noise on the stairs soon summoned to his master's\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nAnd now Jones was unwillingly obliged to return to his own apartment,\r\nwhere at the very instant of his entrance he heard Lady Bellaston\r\nventing an exclamation, though not a very loud one; and at the same\r\ntime saw her flinging herself into a chair in a vast agitation, which\r\nin a lady of a tender constitution would have been an hysteric fit.\r\n\r\nIn reality the lady, frightened with the struggle between the two men,\r\nof which she did not know what would be the issue, as she heard\r\nNightingale swear many oaths he would come to his own bed, attempted\r\nto retire to her known place of hiding, which to her great confusion\r\nshe found already occupied by another.\r\n\r\n“Is this usage to be borne, Mr Jones?” cries the lady.--“Basest of\r\nmen?----What wretch is this to whom you have exposed me?” “Wretch!”\r\n cries Honour, bursting in a violent rage from her place of\r\nconcealment--“Marry come up!----Wretch forsooth?----as poor a wretch\r\nas I am, I am honest; this is more than some folks who are richer can\r\nsay.”\r\n\r\nJones, instead of applying himself directly to take off the edge of\r\nMrs Honour's resentment, as a more experienced gallant would have\r\ndone, fell to cursing his stars, and lamenting himself as the most\r\nunfortunate man in the world; and presently after, addressing himself\r\nto Lady Bellaston, he fell to some very absurd protestations of\r\ninnocence. By this time the lady, having recovered the use of her\r\nreason, which she had as ready as any woman in the world, especially\r\non such occasions, calmly replied: “Sir, you need make no apologies, I\r\nsee now who the person is; I did not at first know Mrs Honour: but now\r\nI do, I can suspect nothing wrong between her and you; and I am sure\r\nshe is a woman of too good sense to put any wrong constructions upon\r\nmy visit to you; I have been always her friend, and it may be in my\r\npower to be much more hereafter.”\r\n\r\nMrs Honour was altogether as placable as she was passionate. Hearing,\r\ntherefore, Lady Bellaston assume the soft tone, she likewise softened\r\nhers.----“I'm sure, madam,” says she, “I have been always ready to\r\nacknowledge your ladyship's friendships to me; sure I never had so\r\ngood a friend as your ladyship----and to be sure, now I see it is your\r\nladyship that I spoke to, I could almost bite my tongue off for very\r\nmad.--I constructions upon your ladyship--to be sure it doth not\r\nbecome a servant as I am to think about such a great lady--I mean I\r\nwas a servant: for indeed I am nobody's servant now, the more\r\nmiserable wretch is me.--I have lost the best mistress----” Here\r\nHonour thought fit to produce a shower of tears.--“Don't cry, child,”\r\n says the good lady; “ways perhaps may be found to make you amends.\r\nCome to me to-morrow morning.” She then took up her fan which lay on\r\nthe ground, and without even looking at Jones walked very majestically\r\nout of the room; there being a kind of dignity in the impudence of\r\nwomen of quality, which their inferiors vainly aspire to attain to in\r\ncircumstances of this nature.\r\n\r\nJones followed her downstairs, often offering her his hand, which she\r\nabsolutely refused him, and got into her chair without taking any\r\nnotice of him as he stood bowing before her.\r\n\r\nAt his return upstairs, a long dialogue past between him and Mrs\r\nHonour, while she was adjusting herself after the discomposure she had\r\nundergone. The subject of this was his infidelity to her young lady;\r\non which she enlarged with great bitterness; but Jones at last found\r\nmeans to reconcile her, and not only so, but to obtain a promise of\r\nmost inviolable secrecy, and that she would the next morning endeavour\r\nto find out Sophia, and bring him a further account of the proceedings\r\nof the squire.\r\n\r\nThus ended this unfortunate adventure to the satisfaction only of Mrs\r\nHonour; for a secret (as some of my readers will perhaps acknowledge\r\nfrom experience) is often a very valuable possession: and that not\r\nonly to those who faithfully keep it, but sometimes to such as whisper\r\nit about till it come to the ears of every one except the ignorant\r\nperson who pays for the supposed concealing of what is publickly\r\nknown."

      "content": "Short and sweet.\r\n\nNotwithstanding all the obligations she had received from Jones, Mrs\r\nMiller could not forbear in the morning some gentle remonstrances for\r\nthe hurricane which had happened the preceding night in his chamber.\r\nThese were, however, so gentle and so friendly, professing, and indeed\r\ntruly, to aim at nothing more than the real good of Mr Jones himself,\r\nthat he, far from being offended, thankfully received the admonition\r\nof the good woman, expressed much concern for what had past, excused\r\nit as well as he could, and promised never more to bring the same\r\ndisturbances into the house.\r\n\r\nBut though Mrs Miller did not refrain from a short expostulation in\r\nprivate at their first meeting, yet the occasion of his being summoned\r\ndownstairs that morning was of a much more agreeable kind, being\r\nindeed to perform the office of a father to Miss Nancy, and to give\r\nher in wedlock to Mr Nightingale, who was now ready drest, and full as\r\nsober as many of my readers will think a man ought to be who receives\r\na wife in so imprudent a manner.\r\n\r\nAnd here perhaps it may be proper to account for the escape which this\r\nyoung gentleman had made from his uncle, and for his appearance in the\r\ncondition in which we have seen him the night before.\r\n\r\nNow when the uncle had arrived at his lodgings with his nephew, partly\r\nto indulge his own inclinations (for he dearly loved his bottle), and\r\npartly to disqualify his nephew from the immediate execution of his\r\npurpose, he ordered wine to be set on the table; with which he so\r\nbriskly plyed the young gentleman, that this latter, who, though not\r\nmuch used to drinking, did not detest it so as to be guilty of\r\ndisobedience or want of complacence by refusing, was soon completely\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\nJust as the uncle had obtained this victory, and was preparing a bed\r\nfor his nephew, a messenger arrived with a piece of news, which so\r\nentirely disconcerted and shocked him, that he in a moment lost all\r\nconsideration for his nephew, and his whole mind became entirely taken\r\nup with his own concerns.\r\n\r\nThis sudden and afflicting news was no less than that his daughter had\r\ntaken the opportunity of almost the first moment of his absence, and\r\nhad gone off with a neighbouring young clergyman; against whom, though\r\nher father could have had but one objection, namely, that he was worth\r\nnothing, yet she had never thought proper to communicate her amour\r\neven to that father; and so artfully had she managed, that it had\r\nnever been once suspected by any, till now that it was consummated.\r\n\r\nOld Mr Nightingale no sooner received this account, than in the utmost\r\nconfusion he ordered a post-chaise to be instantly got ready, and,\r\nhaving recommended his nephew to the care of a servant, he directly\r\nleft the house, scarce knowing what he did, nor whither he went.\r\n\r\nThe uncle thus departed, when the servant came to attend the nephew to\r\nbed, had waked him for that purpose, and had at last made him sensible\r\nthat his uncle was gone, he, instead of accepting the kind offices\r\ntendered him, insisted on a chair being called; with this the servant,\r\nwho had received no strict orders to the contrary, readily complied;\r\nand, thus being conducted back to the house of Mrs Miller, he had\r\nstaggered up to Mr Jones's chamber, as hath been before recounted.\r\n\r\nThis bar of the uncle being now removed (though young Nightingale knew\r\nnot as yet in what manner), and all parties being quickly ready, the\r\nmother, Mr Jones, Mr Nightingale, and his love, stept into a\r\nhackney-coach, which conveyed them to Doctors' Commons; where Miss\r\nNancy was, in vulgar language, soon made an honest woman, and the poor\r\nmother became, in the purest sense of the word, one of the happiest of\r\nall human beings.\r\n\r\nAnd now Mr Jones, having seen his good offices to that poor woman and\r\nher family brought to a happy conclusion, began to apply himself to\r\nhis own concerns; but here, lest many of my readers should censure his\r\nfolly for thus troubling himself with the affairs of others, and lest\r\nsome few should think he acted more disinterestedly than indeed he\r\ndid, we think proper to assure our reader, that he was so far from\r\nbeing unconcerned in this matter, that he had indeed a very\r\nconsiderable interest in bringing it to that final consummation.\r\n\r\nTo explain this seeming paradox at once, he was one who could truly\r\nsay with him in Terence, _Homo sum: humani nihil a me alienum puto_.\r\nHe was never an indifferent spectator of the misery or happiness of\r\nany one; and he felt either the one or the other in great proportion\r\nas he himself contributed to either. He could not, therefore, be the\r\ninstrument of raising a whole family from the lowest state of\r\nwretchedness to the highest pitch of joy without conveying great\r\nfelicity to himself; more perhaps than worldly men often purchase to\r\nthemselves by undergoing the most severe labour, and often by wading\r\nthrough the deepest iniquity.\r\n\r\nThose readers who are of the same complexion with him will perhaps\r\nthink this short chapter contains abundance of matter; while others\r\nmay probably wish, short as it is, that it had been totally spared as\r\nimpertinent to the main design, which I suppose they conclude is to\r\nbring Mr Jones to the gallows, or, if possible, to a more deplorable\r\ncatastrophe."

      "content": "Containing love-letters of several sorts.\r\n\nMr Jones, at his return home, found the following letters lying on his\r\ntable, which he luckily opened in the order they were sent.\r\n\r\n LETTER I.\r\n\r\n “Surely I am under some strange infatuation; I cannot keep my\r\n resolutions a moment, however strongly made or justly founded. Last\r\n night I resolved never to see you more; this morning I am willing to\r\n hear if you can, as you say, clear up this affair. And yet I know\r\n that to be impossible. I have said everything to myself which you\r\n can invent.----Perhaps not. Perhaps your invention is stronger. Come\r\n to me, therefore, the moment you receive this. If you can forge an\r\n excuse I almost promise you to believe it. Betrayed too----I will\r\n think no more.----Come to me directly.----This is the third letter I\r\n have writ, the two former are burnt----I am almost inclined to burn\r\n this too----I wish I may preserve my senses.----Come to me\r\n presently.”\r\n\r\n LETTER II.\r\n\r\n “If you ever expect to be forgiven, or even suffered within my\r\n doors, come to me this instant.”\r\n\r\n LETTER III.\r\n\r\n “I now find you was not at home when my notes came to your lodgings.\r\n The moment you receive this let me see you;--I shall not stir out;\r\n nor shall anybody be let in but yourself. Sure nothing can detain\r\n you long.”\r\n\r\nJones had just read over these three billets when Mr Nightingale came\r\ninto the room. “Well, Tom,” said he, “any news from Lady Bellaston,\r\nafter last night's adventure?” (for it was now no secret to any one in\r\nthat house who the lady was). “The Lady Bellaston?” answered Jones\r\nvery gravely.----“Nay, dear Tom,” cries Nightingale, “don't be so\r\nreserved to your friends. Though I was too drunk to see her last\r\nnight, I saw her at the masquerade. Do you think I am ignorant who the\r\nqueen of the fairies is?” “And did you really then know the lady at\r\nthe masquerade?” said Jones. “Yes, upon my soul, did I,” said\r\nNightingale, “and have given you twenty hints of it since, though you\r\nseemed always so tender on that point, that I would not speak plainly.\r\nI fancy, my friend, by your extreme nicety in this matter, you are not\r\nso well acquainted with the character of the lady as with her person.\r\nDon't be angry, Tom, but upon my honour, you are not the first young\r\nfellow she hath debauched. Her reputation is in no danger, believe\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nThough Jones had no reason to imagine the lady to have been of the\r\nvestal kind when his amour began; yet, as he was thoroughly ignorant\r\nof the town, and had very little acquaintance in it, he had no\r\nknowledge of that character which is vulgarly called a demirep; that\r\nis to say, a woman who intrigues with every man she likes, under the\r\nname and appearance of virtue; and who, though some over-nice ladies\r\nwill not be seen with her, is visited (as they term it) by the whole\r\ntown, in short, whom everybody knows to be what nobody calls her.\r\n\r\nWhen he found, therefore, that Nightingale was perfectly acquainted\r\nwith his intrigue, and began to suspect that so scrupulous a delicacy\r\nas he had hitherto observed was not quite necessary on the occasion,\r\nhe gave a latitude to his friend's tongue, and desired him to speak\r\nplainly what he knew, or had ever heard of the lady.\r\n\r\nNightingale, who, in many other instances, was rather too effeminate\r\nin his disposition, had a pretty strong inclination to tittle-tattle.\r\nHe had no sooner, therefore, received a full liberty of speaking from\r\nJones, than he entered upon a long narrative concerning the lady;\r\nwhich, as it contained many particulars highly to her dishonour, we\r\nhave too great a tenderness for all women of condition to repeat. We\r\nwould cautiously avoid giving an opportunity to the future\r\ncommentators on our works, of making any malicious application and of\r\nforcing us to be, against our will, the author of scandal, which never\r\nentered into our head.\r\n\r\nJones, having very attentively heard all that Nightingale had to say,\r\nfetched a deep sigh; which the other, observing, cried, “Heyday! why,\r\nthou art not in love, I hope! Had I imagined my stories would have\r\naffected you, I promise you should never have heard them.” “O my dear\r\nfriend!” cries Jones, “I am so entangled with this woman, that I know\r\nnot how to extricate myself. In love, indeed! no, my friend, but I am\r\nunder obligations to her, and very great ones. Since you know so much,\r\nI will be very explicit with you. It is owing, perhaps, solely to her,\r\nthat I have not, before this, wanted a bit of bread. How can I\r\npossibly desert such a woman? and yet I must desert her, or be guilty\r\nof the blackest treachery to one who deserves infinitely better of me\r\nthan she can; a woman, my Nightingale, for whom I have a passion which\r\nfew can have an idea of. I am half distracted with doubts how to act.”\r\n “And is this other, pray, an honourable mistress?” cries Nightingale.\r\n“Honourable!” answered Jones; “no breath ever yet durst sully her\r\nreputation. The sweetest air is not purer, the limpid stream not\r\nclearer, than her honour. She is all over, both in mind and body,\r\nconsummate perfection. She is the most beautiful creature in the\r\nuniverse: and yet she is mistress of such noble elevated qualities,\r\nthat, though she is never from my thoughts, I scarce ever think of her\r\nbeauty but when I see it.”--“And can you, my good friend,” cries\r\nNightingale, “with such an engagement as this upon your hands,\r\nhesitate a moment about quitting such a--” “Hold,” said Jones, “no\r\nmore abuse of her: I detest the thought of ingratitude.” “Pooh!”\r\n answered the other, “you are not the first upon whom she hath\r\nconferred obligations of this kind. She is remarkably liberal where\r\nshe likes; though, let me tell you, her favours are so prudently\r\nbestowed, that they should rather raise a man's vanity than his\r\ngratitude.” In short, Nightingale proceeded so far on this head, and\r\ntold his friend so many stories of the lady, which he swore to the\r\ntruth of, that he entirely removed all esteem for her from the breast\r\nof Jones; and his gratitude was lessened in proportion. Indeed, he\r\nbegan to look on all the favours he had received rather as wages than\r\nbenefits, which depreciated not only her, but himself too in his own\r\nconceit, and put him quite out of humour with both. From this disgust,\r\nhis mind, by a natural transition, turned towards Sophia; her virtue,\r\nher purity, her love to him, her sufferings on his account, filled all\r\nhis thoughts, and made his commerce with Lady Bellaston appear still\r\nmore odious. The result of all was, that, though his turning himself\r\nout of her service, in which light he now saw his affair with her,\r\nwould be the loss of his bread; yet he determined to quit her, if he\r\ncould but find a handsome pretence: which being communicated to his\r\nfriend, Nightingale considered a little, and then said, “I have it, my\r\nboy! I have found out a sure method; propose marriage to her, and I\r\nwould venture hanging upon the success.” “Marriage?” cries Jones. “Ay,\r\npropose marriage,” answered Nightingale, “and she will declare off in\r\na moment. I knew a young fellow whom she kept formerly, who made the\r\noffer to her in earnest, and was presently turned off for his pains.”\r\n\r\nJones declared he could not venture the experiment. “Perhaps,” said\r\nhe, “she may be less shocked at this proposal from one man than from\r\nanother. And if she should take me at my word, where am I then?\r\ncaught, in my own trap, and undone for ever.” “No;” answered\r\nNightingale, “not if I can give you an expedient by which you may at\r\nany time get out of the trap.”----“What expedient can that be?”\r\n replied Jones. “This,” answered Nightingale. “The young fellow I\r\nmentioned, who is one of the most intimate acquaintances I have in the\r\nworld, is so angry with her for some ill offices she hath since done\r\nhim, that I am sure he would, without any difficulty, give you a sight\r\nof her letters; upon which you may decently break with her; and\r\ndeclare off before the knot is tyed, if she should really be willing\r\nto tie it, which I am convinced she will not.”\r\n\r\nAfter some hesitation, Jones, upon the strength of this assurance,\r\nconsented; but, as he swore he wanted the confidence to propose the\r\nmatter to her face, he wrote the following letter, which Nightingale\r\ndictated:--\r\n\r\n “MADAM,\r\n\r\n “I am extremely concerned, that, by an unfortunate engagement\r\n abroad, I should have missed receiving the honour of your ladyship's\r\n commands the moment they came; and the delay which I must now suffer\r\n of vindicating myself to your ladyship greatly adds to this\r\n misfortune. O, Lady Bellaston! what a terror have I been in for fear\r\n your reputation should be exposed by these perverse accidents! There\r\n is one only way to secure it. I need not name what that is. Only\r\n permit me to say, that as your honour is as dear to me as my own, so\r\n my sole ambition is to have the glory of laying my liberty at your\r\n feet; and believe me when I assure you, I can never be made\r\n completely happy without you generously bestow on me a legal right\r\n of calling you mine for ever.--I am,\r\n\r\n madam,\r\n with most profound respect,\r\n your ladyship's most obliged,\r\n obedient, humble servant,\r\n THOMAS JONES.”\r\n\r\nTo this she presently returned the following answer:\r\n\r\n “SIR,\r\n\r\n “When I read over your serious epistle, I could, from its coldness\r\n and formality, have sworn that you already had the legal right you\r\n mention; nay, that we had for many years composed that monstrous\r\n animal a husband and wife. Do you really then imagine me a fool? or\r\n do you fancy yourself capable of so entirely persuading me out of my\r\n senses, that I should deliver my whole fortune into your power, in\r\n order to enable you to support your pleasures at my expense? Are\r\n these the proofs of love which I expected? Is this the return for--?\r\n but I scorn to upbraid you, and am in great admiration of your\r\n profound respect.\r\n\r\n “P.S. I am prevented from revising:----Perhaps I have said more than\r\n I meant.----Come to me at eight this evening.”\r\n\r\nJones, by the advice of his privy-council, replied:\r\n\r\n “MADAM,\r\n\r\n “It is impossible to express how much I am shocked at the suspicion\r\n you entertain of me. Can Lady Bellaston have conferred favours on a\r\n man whom she could believe capable of so base a design? or can she\r\n treat the most solemn tie of love with contempt? Can you imagine,\r\n madam, that if the violence of my passion, in an unguarded moment,\r\n overcame the tenderness which I have for your honour, I would think\r\n of indulging myself in the continuance of an intercourse which could\r\n not possibly escape long the notice of the world; and which, when\r\n discovered, must prove so fatal to your reputation? If such be your\r\n opinion of me, I must pray for a sudden opportunity of returning\r\n those pecuniary obligations, which I have been so unfortunate to\r\n receive at your hands; and for those of a more tender kind, I shall\r\n ever remain, &c.” And so concluded in the very words with which he\r\n had concluded the former letter.\r\n\r\nThe lady answered as follows:\r\n\r\n “I see you are a villain! and I despise you from my soul. If you\r\n come here I shall not be at home.”\r\n\r\nThough Jones was well satisfied with his deliverance from a thraldom\r\nwhich those who have ever experienced it will, I apprehend, allow to\r\nbe none of the lightest, he was not, however, perfectly easy in his\r\nmind. There was in this scheme too much of fallacy to satisfy one who\r\nutterly detested every species of falshood or dishonesty: nor would\r\nhe, indeed, have submitted to put it in practice, had he not been\r\ninvolved in a distressful situation, where he was obliged to be guilty\r\nof some dishonour, either to the one lady or the other; and surely the\r\nreader will allow, that every good principle, as well as love, pleaded\r\nstrongly in favour of Sophia.\r\n\r\nNightingale highly exulted in the success of his stratagem, upon which\r\nhe received many thanks and much applause from his friend. He\r\nanswered, “Dear Tom, we have conferred very different obligations on\r\neach other. To me you owe the regaining your liberty; to you I owe the\r\nloss of mine. But if you are as happy in the one instance as I am in\r\nthe other, I promise you we are the two happiest fellows in England.”\r\n\r\nThe two gentlemen were now summoned down to dinner, where Mrs Miller,\r\nwho performed herself the office of cook, had exerted her best talents\r\nto celebrate the wedding of her daughter. This joyful circumstance she\r\nascribed principally to the friendly behaviour of Jones, her whole\r\nsoul was fired with gratitude towards him, and all her looks, words,\r\nand actions, were so busied in expressing it, that her daughter, and\r\neven her new son-in-law, were very little objects of her\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nDinner was just ended when Mrs Miller received a letter; but as we\r\nhave had letters enow in this chapter, we shall communicate its\r\ncontents in our next."

      "title": "Chapter x.",
      "content": "Consisting partly of facts, and partly of observations upon them.\r\n\nThe letter then which arrived at the end of the preceding chapter was\r\nfrom Mr Allworthy, and the purport of it was, his intention to come\r\nimmediately to town, with his nephew Blifil, and a desire to be\r\naccommodated with his usual lodgings, which were the first floor for\r\nhimself, and the second for his nephew.\r\n\r\nThe chearfulness which had before displayed itself in the countenance\r\nof the poor woman was a little clouded on this occasion. This news did\r\nindeed a good deal disconcert her. To requite so disinterested a match\r\nwith her daughter, by presently turning her new son-in-law out of\r\ndoors, appeared to her very unjustifiable on the one hand; and on the\r\nother, she could scarce bear the thoughts of making any excuse to Mr\r\nAllworthy, after all the obligations received from him, for depriving\r\nhim of lodgings which were indeed strictly his due; for that\r\ngentleman, in conferring all his numberless benefits on others, acted\r\nby a rule diametrically opposite to what is practised by most generous\r\npeople. He contrived, on all occasions, to hide his beneficence, not\r\nonly from the world, but even from the object of it. He constantly\r\nused the words Lend and Pay, instead of Give; and by every other\r\nmethod he could invent, always lessened with his tongue the favours he\r\nconferred, while he was heaping them with both his hands. When he\r\nsettled the annuity of £50 a year therefore on Mrs Miller, he told\r\nher, “it was in consideration of always having her first-floor when he\r\nwas in town (which he scarce ever intended to be), but that she might\r\nlet it at any other time, for that he would always send her a month's\r\nwarning.” He was now, however, hurried to town so suddenly, that he\r\nhad no opportunity of giving such notice; and this hurry probably\r\nprevented him, when he wrote for his lodgings, adding, if they were\r\nthen empty; for he would most certainly have been well satisfied to\r\nhave relinquished them, on a less sufficient excuse than what Mrs\r\nMiller could now have made.\r\n\r\nBut there are a sort of persons, who, as Prior excellently well\r\nremarks, direct their conduct by something\r\n\r\n Beyond the fix'd and settled rules\r\n Of vice and virtue in the schools,\r\n Beyond the letter of the law.\r\n\r\nTo these it is so far from being sufficient that their defence would\r\nacquit them at the Old Bailey, that they are not even contented,\r\nthough conscience, the severest of all judges, should discharge them.\r\nNothing short of the fair and honourable will satisfy the delicacy of\r\ntheir minds; and if any of their actions fall short of this mark, they\r\nmope and pine, are as uneasy and restless as a murderer, who is afraid\r\nof a ghost, or of the hangman.\r\n\r\nMrs Miller was one of these. She could not conceal her uneasiness at\r\nthis letter; with the contents of which she had no sooner acquainted\r\nthe company, and given some hints of her distress, than Jones, her\r\ngood angel, presently relieved her anxiety. “As for myself, madam,”\r\n said he, “my lodging is at your service at a moment's warning; and Mr\r\nNightingale, I am sure, as he cannot yet prepare a house fit to\r\nreceive his lady, will consent to return to his new lodging, whither\r\nMrs Nightingale will certainly consent to go.” With which proposal\r\nboth husband and wife instantly agreed.\r\n\r\nThe reader will easily believe, that the cheeks of Mrs Miller began\r\nagain to glow with additional gratitude to Jones; but, perhaps, it may\r\nbe more difficult to persuade him, that Mr Jones having in his last\r\nspeech called her daughter Mrs Nightingale (it being the first time\r\nthat agreeable sound had ever reached her ears), gave the fond mother\r\nmore satisfaction, and warmed her heart more towards Jones, than his\r\nhaving dissipated her present anxiety.\r\n\r\nThe next day was then appointed for the removal of the new-married\r\ncouple, and of Mr Jones, who was likewise to be provided for in the\r\nsame house with his friend. And now the serenity of the company was\r\nagain restored, and they past the day in the utmost chearfulness, all\r\nexcept Jones, who, though he outwardly accompanied the rest in their\r\nmirth, felt many a bitter pang on the account of his Sophia, which\r\nwere not a little heightened by the news of Mr Blifil's coming to town\r\n(for he clearly saw the intention of his journey); and what greatly\r\naggravated his concern was, that Mrs Honour, who had promised to\r\ninquire after Sophia, and to make her report to him early the next\r\nevening, had disappointed him.\r\n\r\nIn the situation that he and his mistress were in at this time, there\r\nwere scarce any grounds for him to hope that he should hear any good\r\nnews; yet he was as impatient to see Mrs Honour as if he had expected\r\nshe would bring him a letter with an assignation in it from Sophia,\r\nand bore the disappointment as ill. Whether this impatience arose from\r\nthat natural weakness of the human mind, which makes it desirous to\r\nknow the worst, and renders uncertainty the most intolerable of pains;\r\nor whether he still flattered himself with some secret hopes, we will\r\nnot determine. But that it might be the last, whoever has loved cannot\r\nbut know. For of all the powers exercised by this passion over our\r\nminds, one of the most wonderful is that of supporting hope in the\r\nmidst of despair. Difficulties, improbabilities, nay, impossibilities,\r\nare quite overlooked by it; so that to any man extremely in love, may\r\nbe applied what Addison says of Caesar,\r\n\r\n “The Alps, and Pyrenaeans, sink before him!”\r\n\r\nYet it is equally true, that the same passion will sometimes make\r\nmountains of molehills, and produce despair in the midst of hope; but\r\nthese cold fits last not long in good constitutions. Which temper\r\nJones was now in, we leave the reader to guess, having no exact\r\ninformation about it; but this is certain, that he had spent two hours\r\nin expectation, when, being unable any longer to conceal his\r\nuneasiness, he retired to his room; where his anxiety had almost made\r\nhim frantick, when the following letter was brought him from Mrs\r\nHonour, with which we shall present the reader _verbatim et\r\nliteratim._\r\n\r\n “SIR,\r\n\r\n “I shud sartenly haf kaled on you a cordin too mi prommiss haddunt\r\n itt bin that hur lashipp prevent mee; for to bee sur, Sir, you nose\r\n very well that evere persun must luk furst at ome, and sartenly such\r\n anuther offar mite not have ever hapned, so as I shud ave bin justly\r\n to blam, had I not excepted of it when her lashipp was so veri kind\r\n as to offar to mak mee hur one uman without mi ever askin any such\r\n thing, to be sur shee is won of thee best ladis in thee wurld, and\r\n pepil who sase to the kontrari must bee veri wiket pepil in thare\r\n harts.

      "content": "Containing curious, but not unprecedented matter.\r\n\nThere was a lady, one Mrs Hunt, who had often seen Jones at the house\r\nwhere he lodged, being intimately acquainted with the women there, and\r\nindeed a very great friend to Mrs Miller. Her age was about thirty,\r\nfor she owned six-and-twenty; her face and person very good, only\r\ninclining a little too much to be fat. She had been married young by\r\nher relations to an old Turkey merchant, who, having got a great\r\nfortune, had left off trade. With him she lived without reproach, but\r\nnot without pain, in a state of great self-denial, for about twelve\r\nyears; and her virtue was rewarded by his dying and leaving her very\r\nrich. The first year of her widowhood was just at an end, and she had\r\npast it in a good deal of retirement, seeing only a few particular\r\nfriends, and dividing her time between her devotions and novels, of\r\nwhich she was always extremely fond. Very good health, a very warm\r\nconstitution, and a good deal of religion, made it absolutely\r\nnecessary for her to marry again; and she resolved to please herself\r\nin her second husband, as she had done her friends in the first. From\r\nher the following billet was brought to Jones:--\r\n\r\n “SIR,\r\n\r\n “From the first day I saw you, I doubt my eyes have told you too\r\n plainly that you were not indifferent to me; but neither my tongue\r\n nor my hand should have ever avowed it, had not the ladies of the\r\n family where you are lodged given me such a character of you, and\r\n told me such proofs of your virtue and goodness, as convince me you\r\n are not only the most agreeable, but the most worthy of men. I have\r\n also the satisfaction to hear from them, that neither my person,\r\n understanding, or character, are disagreeable to you. I have a\r\n fortune sufficient to make us both happy, but which cannot make me\r\n so without you. In thus disposing of myself, I know I shall incur\r\n the censure of the world; but if I did not love you more than I fear\r\n the world, I should not be worthy of you. One only difficulty stops\r\n me: I am informed you are engaged in a commerce of gallantry with a\r\n woman of fashion. If you think it worth while to sacrifice that to\r\n the possession of me, I am yours; if not, forget my weakness, and\r\n let this remain an eternal secret between you and\r\n\r\n “ARABELLA HUNT.”\r\n\r\nAt the reading of this, Jones was put into a violent flutter. His\r\nfortune was then at a very low ebb, the source being stopt from which\r\nhitherto he had been supplied. Of all he had received from Lady\r\nBellaston, not above five guineas remained; and that very morning he\r\nhad been dunned by a tradesman for twice that sum. His honourable\r\nmistress was in the hands of her father, and he had scarce any hopes\r\never to get her out of them again. To be subsisted at her expense,\r\nfrom that little fortune she had independent of her father, went much\r\nagainst the delicacy both of his pride and his love. This lady's\r\nfortune would have been exceeding convenient to him, and he could have\r\nno objection to her in any respect. On the contrary, he liked her as\r\nwell as he did any woman except Sophia. But to abandon Sophia, and\r\nmarry another, that was impossible; he could not think of it upon any\r\naccount, Yet why should he not, since it was plain she could not be\r\nhis? Would it not be kinder to her, than to continue her longer\r\nengaged in a hopeless passion for him? Ought he not to do so in\r\nfriendship to her? This notion prevailed some moments, and he had\r\nalmost determined to be false to her from a high point of honour: but\r\nthat refinement was not able to stand very long against the voice of\r\nnature, which cried in his heart that such friendship was treason to\r\nlove. At last he called for pen, ink, and paper, and writ as follows\r\nto Mrs Hunt:--\r\n\r\n “MADAM,\r\n\r\n “It would be but a poor return to the favour you have done me to\r\n sacrifice any gallantry to the possession of you, and I would\r\n certainly do it, though I were not disengaged, as at present I am,\r\n from any affair of that kind. But I should not be the honest man you\r\n think me, if I did not tell you that my affections are engaged to\r\n another, who is a woman of virtue, and one that I never can leave,\r\n though it is probable I shall never possess her. God forbid that, in\r\n return of your kindness to me, I should do you such an injury as to\r\n give you my hand when I cannot give my heart. No; I had much rather\r\n starve than be guilty of that. Even though my mistress were married\r\n to another, I would not marry you unless my heart had entirely\r\n effaced all impressions of her. Be assured that your secret was not\r\n more safe in your own breast, than in that of your most obliged, and\r\n grateful humble servant,\r\n\r\n “T. JONES.”\r\n\r\nWhen our heroe had finished and sent this letter, he went to his\r\nscrutore, took out Miss Western's muff, kissed it several times, and\r\nthen strutted some turns about his room, with more satisfaction of\r\nmind than ever any Irishman felt in carrying off a fortune of fifty\r\nthousand pounds."

      "content": "A discovery made by Partridge.\r\n\nWhile Jones was exulting in the consciousness of his integrity,\r\nPartridge came capering into the room, as was his custom when he\r\nbrought, or fancied he brought, any good tidings. He had been\r\ndespatched that morning by his master, with orders to endeavour, by\r\nthe servants of Lady Bellaston, or by any other means, to discover\r\nwhither Sophia had been conveyed; and he now returned, and with a\r\njoyful countenance told our heroe that he had found the lost bird. “I\r\nhave seen, sir,” says he, “Black George, the gamekeeper, who is one of\r\nthe servants whom the squire hath brought with him to town. I knew him\r\npresently, though I have not seen him these several years; but you\r\nknow, sir, he is a very remarkable man, or, to use a purer phrase, he\r\nhath a most remarkable beard, the largest and blackest I ever saw. It\r\nwas some time, however, before Black George could recollect me.”\r\n “Well, but what is your good news?” cries Jones; “what do you know of\r\nmy Sophia?” “You shall know presently, sir,” answered Partridge, “I am\r\ncoming to it as fast as I can. You are so impatient, sir, you would\r\ncome at the infinitive mood before you can get to the imperative. As I\r\nwas saying, sir, it was some time before he recollected my\r\nface.”--“Confound your face!” cries Jones, “what of my Sophia?” “Nay,\r\nsir,” answered Partridge, “I know nothing more of Madam Sophia than\r\nwhat I am going to tell you; and I should have told you all before\r\nthis if you had not interrupted me; but if you look so angry at me you\r\nwill frighten all of it out of my head, or, to use a purer phrase, out\r\nof my memory. I never saw you look so angry since the day we left\r\nUpton, which I shall remember if I was to live a thousand\r\nyears.”--“Well, pray go on your own way,” said Jones: “you are\r\nresolved to make me mad I find.” “Not for the world,” answered\r\nPartridge, “I have suffered enough for that already; which, as I said,\r\nI shall bear in my remembrance the longest day I have to live.” “Well,\r\nbut Black George?” cries Jones. “Well, sir, as I was saying, it was a\r\nlong time before he could recollect me; for, indeed, I am very much\r\naltered since I saw him. _Non sum qualis eram._ I have had troubles in\r\nthe world, and nothing alters a man so much as grief. I have heard it\r\nwill change the colour of a man's hair in a night. However, at last,\r\nknow me he did, that's sure enough; for we are both of an age, and\r\nwere at the same charity school. George was a great dunce, but no\r\nmatter for that; all men do not thrive in the world according to their\r\nlearning. I am sure I have reason to say so; but it will be all one a\r\nthousand years hence. Well, sir, where was I?--O--well, we no sooner\r\nknew each other, than, after many hearty shakes by the hand, we agreed\r\nto go to an alehouse and take a pot, and by good luck the beer was\r\nsome of the best I have met with since I have been in town. Now, sir,\r\nI am coming to the point; for no sooner did I name you, and told him\r\nthat you and I came to town together, and had lived together ever\r\nsince, than he called for another pot, and swore he would drink to\r\nyour health; and indeed he drank your health so heartily that I was\r\noverjoyed to see there was so much gratitude left in the world; and\r\nafter we had emptied that pot I said I would buy my pot too, and so we\r\ndrank another to your health; and then I made haste home to tell you\r\nthe news.”\r\n\r\n“What news?” cries Jones, “you have not mentioned a word of my\r\nSophia!” “Bless me! I had like to have forgot that. Indeed, we\r\nmentioned a great deal about young Madam Western, and George told me\r\nall; that Mr Blifil is coming to town in order to be married to her.\r\nHe had best make haste then, says I, or somebody will have her before\r\nhe comes; and, indeed, says I, Mr Seagrim, it is a thousand pities\r\nsomebody should not have her; for he certainly loves her above all the\r\nwomen in the world. I would have both you and she know, that it is not\r\nfor her fortune he follows her; for I can assure you, as to matter of\r\nthat, there is another lady, one of much greater quality and fortune\r\nthan she can pretend to, who is so fond of somebody that she comes\r\nafter him day and night.”\r\n\r\nHere Jones fell into a passion with Partridge, for having, as he said,\r\nbetrayed him; but the poor fellow answered, he had mentioned no name:\r\n“Besides, sir,” said he, “I can assure you George is sincerely your\r\nfriend, and wished Mr Blifil at the devil more than once; nay, he said\r\nhe would do anything in his power upon earth to serve you; and so I am\r\nconvinced he will. Betray you, indeed! why, I question whether you\r\nhave a better friend than George upon earth, except myself, or one\r\nthat would go farther to serve you.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” says Jones, a little pacified, “you say this fellow, who, I\r\nbelieve, indeed, is enough inclined to be my friend, lives in the same\r\nhouse with Sophia?”\r\n\r\n“In the same house!” answered Partridge; “why, sir, he is one of the\r\nservants of the family, and very well drest I promise you he is; if it\r\nwas not for his black beard you would hardly know him.”\r\n\r\n“One service then at least he may do me,” says Jones: “sure he can\r\ncertainly convey a letter to my Sophia.”\r\n\r\n“You have hit the nail _ad unguem_” cries Partridge; “how came I not\r\nto think of it? I will engage he shall do it upon the very first\r\nmentioning.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” said Jones, “do you leave me at present, and I will\r\nwrite a letter, which you shall deliver to him to-morrow morning; for\r\nI suppose you know where to find him.”\r\n\r\n“O yes, sir,” answered Partridge, “I shall certainly find him again;\r\nthere is no fear of that. The liquor is too good for him to stay away\r\nlong. I make no doubt but he will be there every day he stays in\r\ntown.”\r\n\r\n“So you don't know the street then where my Sophia is lodged?” cries\r\nJones.\r\n\r\n“Indeed, sir, I do,” says Partridge.\r\n\r\n“What is the name of the street?” cries Jones.\r\n\r\n“The name, sir? why, here, sir, just by,” answered Partridge, “not\r\nabove a street or two off. I don't, indeed, know the very name; for,\r\nas he never told me, if I had asked, you know, it might have put some\r\nsuspicion into his head. No, no, sir, let me alone for that. I am too\r\ncunning for that, I promise you.”\r\n\r\n“Thou art most wonderfully cunning, indeed,” replied Jones; “however,\r\nI will write to my charmer, since I believe you will be cunning enough\r\nto find him to-morrow at the alehouse.”\r\n\r\nAnd now, having dismissed the sagacious Partridge, Mr Jones sat\r\nhimself down to write, in which employment we shall leave him for a\r\ntime. And here we put an end to the fifteenth book.\r\n\nBOOK XVI.\r\n\r\nCONTAINING THE SPACE OF FIVE DAYS."

      "content": "Of prologues.\r\n\nI have heard of a dramatic writer who used to say, he would rather\r\nwrite a play than a prologue; in like manner, I think, I can with less\r\npains write one of the books of this history than the prefatory\r\nchapter to each of them.\r\n\r\nTo say the truth, I believe many a hearty curse hath been devoted on\r\nthe head of that author who first instituted the method of prefixing\r\nto his play that portion of matter which is called the prologue; and\r\nwhich at first was part of the piece itself, but of latter years hath\r\nhad usually so little connexion with the drama before which it stands,\r\nthat the prologue to one play might as well serve for any other. Those\r\nindeed of more modern date, seem all to be written on the same three\r\ntopics, viz., an abuse of the taste of the town, a condemnation of all\r\ncontemporary authors, and an eulogium on the performance just about to\r\nbe represented. The sentiments in all these are very little varied,\r\nnor is it possible they should; and indeed I have often wondered at\r\nthe great invention of authors, who have been capable of finding such\r\nvarious phrases to express the same thing.\r\n\r\nIn like manner I apprehend, some future historian (if any one shall do\r\nme the honour of imitating my manner) will, after much scratching his\r\npate, bestow some good wishes on my memory, for having first\r\nestablished these several initial chapters; most of which, like modern\r\nprologues, may as properly be prefixed to any other book in this\r\nhistory as to that which they introduce, or indeed to any other\r\nhistory as to this.\r\n\r\nBut however authors may suffer by either of these inventions, the\r\nreader will find sufficient emolument in the one as the spectator hath\r\nlong found in the other.\r\n\r\nFirst, it is well known that the prologue serves the critic for an\r\nopportunity to try his faculty of hissing, and to tune his cat-call to\r\nthe best advantage; by which means, I have known those musical\r\ninstruments so well prepared, that they have been able to play in full\r\nconcert at the first rising of the curtain.\r\n\r\nThe same advantages may be drawn from these chapters, in which the\r\ncritic will be always sure of meeting with something that may serve as\r\na whetstone to his noble spirit; so that he may fall with a more\r\nhungry appetite for censure on the history itself. And here his\r\nsagacity must make it needless to observe how artfully these chapters\r\nare calculated for that excellent purpose; for in these we have always\r\ntaken care to intersperse somewhat of the sour or acid kind, in order\r\nto sharpen and stimulate the said spirit of criticism.\r\n\r\nAgain, the indolent reader, as well as spectator, finds great\r\nadvantage from both these; for, as they are not obliged either to see\r\nthe one or read the others, and both the play and the book are thus\r\nprotracted, by the former they have a quarter of an hour longer\r\nallowed them to sit at dinner, and by the latter they have the\r\nadvantage of beginning to read at the fourth or fifth page instead of\r\nthe first, a matter by no means of trivial consequence to persons who\r\nread books with no other view than to say they have read them, a more\r\ngeneral motive to reading than is commonly imagined; and from which\r\nnot only law books, and good books, but the pages of Homer and Virgil,\r\nof Swift and Cervantes, have been often turned over.\r\n\r\nMany other are the emoluments which arise from both these, but they\r\nare for the most part so obvious, that we shall not at present stay to\r\nenumerate them; especially since it occurs to us that the principal\r\nmerit of both the prologue and the preface is that they be short."

      "content": "A whimsical adventure which befel the squire, with the distressed\r\nsituation of Sophia.\r\n\nWe must now convey the reader to Mr Western's lodgings, which were in\r\nPiccadilly, where he was placed by the recommendation of the landlord\r\nat the Hercules Pillars at Hyde Park Corner; for at the inn, which was\r\nthe first he saw on his arrival in town, he placed his horses, and in\r\nthose lodgings, which were the first he heard of, he deposited\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nHere, when Sophia alighted from the hackney-coach, which brought her\r\nfrom the house of Lady Bellaston, she desired to retire to the\r\napartment provided for her; to which her father very readily agreed,\r\nand whither he attended her himself. A short dialogue, neither very\r\nmaterial nor pleasant to relate minutely, then passed between them, in\r\nwhich he pressed her vehemently to give her consent to the marriage\r\nwith Blifil, who, as he acquainted her, was to be in town in a few\r\ndays; but, instead of complying, she gave a more peremptory and\r\nresolute refusal than she had ever done before. This so incensed her\r\nfather, that after many bitter vows, that he would force her to have\r\nhim whether she would or no, he departed from her with many hard words\r\nand curses, locked the door, and put the key into his pocket.\r\n\r\nWhile Sophia was left with no other company than what attend the\r\nclosest state prisoner, namely, fire and candle, the squire sat down\r\nto regale himself over a bottle of wine, with his parson and the\r\nlandlord of the Hercules Pillars, who, as the squire said, would make\r\nan excellent third man, and could inform them of the news of the town,\r\nand how affairs went; for to be sure, says he, he knows a great deal,\r\nsince the horses of many of the quality stand at his house.\r\n\r\nIn this agreeable society Mr Western past that evening and great part\r\nof the succeeding day, during which period nothing happened of\r\nsufficient consequence to find a place in this history. All this time\r\nSophia past by herself; for her father swore she should never come out\r\nof her chamber alive, unless she first consented to marry Blifil; nor\r\ndid he ever suffer the door to be unlocked, unless to convey her food,\r\non which occasions he always attended himself.\r\n\r\nThe second morning after his arrival, while he and the parson were at\r\nbreakfast together on a toast and tankard, he was informed that a\r\ngentleman was below to wait on him.\r\n\r\n“A gentleman!” quoth the squire, “who the devil can he be? Do, doctor,\r\ngo down and see who 'tis. Mr Blifil can hardly be come to town\r\nyet.--Go down, do, and know what his business is.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor returned with an account that it was a very well-drest man,\r\nand by the ribbon in his hat he took him for an officer of the army;\r\nthat he said he had some particular business, which he could deliver\r\nto none but Mr Western himself.\r\n\r\n“An officer!” cries the squire; “what can any such fellow have to do\r\nwith me? If he wants an order for baggage-waggons, I am no justice of\r\npeace here, nor can I grant a warrant.--Let un come up then, if he\r\nmust speak to me.”\r\n\r\nA very genteel man now entered the room; who, having made his\r\ncompliments to the squire, and desired the favour of being alone with\r\nhim, delivered himself as follows:--\r\n\r\n“Sir, I come to wait upon you by the command of my Lord Fellamar; but\r\nwith a very different message from what I suppose you expect, after\r\nwhat past the other night.”\r\n\r\n“My lord who?” cries the squire; “I never heard the name o'un.”\r\n\r\n“His lordship,” said the gentleman, “is willing to impute everything\r\nto the effect of liquor, and the most trifling acknowledgment of that\r\nkind will set everything right; for as he hath the most violent\r\nattachment to your daughter, you, sir, are the last person upon earth\r\nfrom whom he would resent an affront; and happy is it for you both\r\nthat he hath given such public demonstrations of his courage as to be\r\nable to put up an affair of this kind without danger of any imputation\r\non his honour. All he desires, therefore, is, that you will before me\r\nmake some acknowledgment; the slightest in the world will be\r\nsufficient; and he intends this afternoon to pay his respects to you,\r\nin order to obtain your leave of visiting the young lady on the\r\nfooting of a lover.”\r\n\r\n“I don't understand much of what you say, sir,” said the squire; “but\r\nI suppose, by what you talk about my daughter, that this is the lord\r\nwhich my cousin, Lady Bellaston, mentioned to me, and said something\r\nabout his courting my daughter. If so be that how that be the\r\ncase--you may give my service to his lordship, and tell un the girl is\r\ndisposed of already.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps, sir,” said the gentleman, “you are not sufficiently apprized\r\nof the greatness of this offer. I believe such a person, title, and\r\nfortune would be nowhere refused.”\r\n\r\n“Lookee, sir,” answered the squire; “to be very plain, my daughter is\r\nbespoke already; but if she was not, I would not marry her to a lord\r\nupon any account; I hate all lords; they are a parcel of courtiers and\r\nHanoverians, and I will have nothing to do with them.”\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” said the gentleman, “if that is your resolution, the\r\nmessage I am to deliver to you is that my lord desires the favour of\r\nyour company this morning in Hyde Park.”\r\n\r\n“You may tell my lord,” answered the squire, “that I am busy and\r\ncannot come. I have enough to look after at home, and can't stir\r\nabroad on any account.”\r\n\r\n“I am sure, sir,” quoth the other, “you are too much a gentleman to\r\nsend such a message; you will not, I am convinced, have it said of\r\nyou, that, after having affronted a noble peer, you refuse him\r\nsatisfaction. His lordship would have been willing, from his great\r\nregard to the young lady, to have made up matters in another way; but\r\nunless he is to look on you as a father, his honour will not suffer\r\nhis putting up such an indignity as you must be sensible you offered\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“I offered him!” cries the squire; “it is a d--n'd lie! I never\r\noffered him anything.”\r\n\r\nUpon these words the gentleman returned a very short verbal rebuke,\r\nand this he accompanied at the same time with some manual\r\nremonstrances, which no sooner reached the ears of Mr Western, than\r\nthat worthy squire began to caper very briskly about the room,\r\nbellowing at the same time with all his might, as if desirous to\r\nsummon a greater number of spectators to behold his agility.\r\n\r\nThe parson, who had left great part of the tankard unfinished, was not\r\nretired far; he immediately attended therefore on the squire's\r\nvociferation, crying, “Bless me! sir, what's the matter?”--“Matter!”\r\n quoth the squire, “here's a highwayman, I believe, who wants to rob\r\nand murder me--for he hath fallen upon me with that stick there in his\r\nhand, when I wish I may be d--n'd if I gid un the least provocation.”\r\n\r\n“How, sir,” said the captain, “did you not tell me I lyed?”\r\n\r\n“No, as I hope to be saved,” answered the squire, “--I believe I might\r\nsay, 'Twas a lie that I had offered any affront to my lord--but I\r\nnever said the word, `you lie.'--I understand myself better, and you\r\nmight have understood yourself better than to fall upon a naked man.\r\nIf I had a stick in my hand, you would not have dared strike me. I'd\r\nhave knocked thy lantern jaws about thy ears. Come down into yard this\r\nminute, and I'll take a bout with thee at single stick for a broken\r\nhead, that I will; or I will go into naked room and box thee for a\r\nbelly-full. At unt half a man, at unt, I'm sure.”\r\n\r\nThe captain, with some indignation, replied, “I see, sir, you are\r\nbelow my notice, and I shall inform his lordship you are below his. I\r\nam sorry I have dirtied my fingers with you.” At which words he\r\nwithdrew, the parson interposing to prevent the squire from stopping\r\nhim, in which he easily prevailed, as the other, though he made some\r\nefforts for the purpose, did not seem very violently bent on success.\r\nHowever, when the captain was departed, the squire sent many curses\r\nand some menaces after him; but as these did not set out from his lips\r\ntill the officer was at the bottom of the stairs, and grew louder and\r\nlouder as he was more and more remote, they did not reach his ears, or\r\nat least did not retard his departure.\r\n\r\nPoor Sophia, however, who, in her prison, heard all her father's\r\noutcries from first to last, began now first to thunder with her foot,\r\nand afterwards to scream as loudly as the old gentleman himself had\r\ndone before, though in a much sweeter voice. These screams soon\r\nsilenced the squire, and turned all his consideration towards his\r\ndaughter, whom he loved so tenderly, that the least apprehension of\r\nany harm happening to her, threw him presently into agonies; for,\r\nexcept in that single instance in which the whole future happiness of\r\nher life was concerned, she was sovereign mistress of his\r\ninclinations.\r\n\r\nHaving ended his rage against the captain, with swearing he would take\r\nthe law of him, the squire now mounted upstairs to Sophia, whom, as\r\nsoon as he had unlocked and opened the door, he found all pale and\r\nbreathless. The moment, however, that she saw her father, she\r\ncollected all her spirits, and, catching him hold by the hand, she\r\ncryed passionately, “O my dear sir, I am almost frightened to death! I\r\nhope to heaven no harm hath happened to you.” “No, no,” cries the\r\nsquire, “no great harm. The rascal hath not hurt me much, but rat me\r\nif I don't ha the la o' un.” “Pray, dear sir,” says she, “tell me\r\nwhat's the matter; who is it that hath insulted you?” “I don't know\r\nthe name o' un,” answered Western; “some officer fellow, I suppose,\r\nthat we are to pay for beating us; but I'll make him pay this bout, if\r\nthe rascal hath got anything, which I suppose he hath not. For thof he\r\nwas drest out so vine, I question whether he had got a voot of land in\r\nthe world.” “But, dear sir,” cries she, “what was the occasion of your\r\nquarrel?” “What should it be, Sophy,” answered the squire, “but about\r\nyou, Sophy? All my misfortunes are about you; you will be the death of\r\nyour poor father at last. Here's a varlet of a lord, the Lord knows\r\nwho, forsooth! who hath a taan a liking to you, and because I would\r\nnot gi un my consent, he sent me a kallenge. Come, do be a good girl,\r\nSophy, and put an end to all your father's troubles; come, do consent\r\nto ha un; he will be in town within this day or two; do but promise me\r\nto marry un as soon as he comes, and you will make me the happiest man\r\nin the world, and I will make you the happiest woman; you shall have\r\nthe finest cloaths in London, and the finest jewels, and a coach and\r\nsix at your command. I promised Allworthy already to give up half my\r\nestate--od rabbet it! I should hardly stick at giving up the whole.”\r\n “Will my papa be so kind,” says she, “as to hear me speak?”--“Why wout\r\nask, Sophy?” cries he, “when dost know I had rather hear thy voice\r\nthan the musick of the best pack of dogs in England.--Hear thee, my\r\ndear little girl! I hope I shall hear thee as long as I live; for if I\r\nwas ever to lose that pleasure, I would not gee a brass varden to live\r\na moment longer. Indeed, Sophy, you do not know how I love you, indeed\r\nyou don't, or you never could have run away and left your poor father,\r\nwho hath no other joy, no other comfort upon earth, but his little\r\nSophy.” At these words the tears stood in his eyes; and Sophia (with\r\nthe tears streaming from hers) answered, “Indeed, my dear papa, I know\r\nyou have loved me tenderly, and heaven is my witness how sincerely I\r\nhave returned your affection; nor could anything but an apprehension\r\nof being forced into the arms of this man have driven me to run from a\r\nfather whom I love so passionately, that I would, with pleasure,\r\nsacrifice my life to his happiness; nay, I have endeavoured to reason\r\nmyself into doing more, and had almost worked up a resolution to\r\nendure the most miserable of all lives, to comply with your\r\ninclination. It was that resolution alone to which I could not force\r\nmy mind; nor can I ever.” Here the squire began to look wild, and the\r\nfoam appeared at his lips, which Sophia, observing, begged to be heard\r\nout, and then proceeded: “If my father's life, his health, or any real\r\nhappiness of his was at stake, here stands your resolved daughter; may\r\nheaven blast me if there is a misery I would not suffer to preserve\r\nyou!--No, that most detested, most loathsome of all lots would I\r\nembrace. I would give my hand to Blifil for your sake.”--“I tell thee,\r\nit will preserve me,” answers the father; “it will give me health,\r\nhappiness, life, everything.--Upon my soul I shall die if dost refuse\r\nme; I shall break my heart, I shall, upon my soul.”--“Is it possible,”\r\n says she, “you can have such a desire to make me miserable?”--“I tell\r\nthee noa,” answered he loudly, “d--n me if there is a thing upon earth\r\nI would not do to see thee happy.”--“And will not my dear papa allow\r\nme to have the least knowledge of what will make me so? If it be true\r\nthat happiness consists in opinion, what must be my condition, when I\r\nshall think myself the most miserable of all the wretches upon earth?”\r\n “Better think yourself so,” said he, “than know it by being married to\r\na poor bastardly vagabond.” “If it will content you, sir,” said\r\nSophia, “I will give you the most solemn promise never to marry him,\r\nnor any other, while my papa lives, without his consent. Let me\r\ndedicate my whole life to your service; let me be again your poor\r\nSophy, and my whole business and pleasure be, as it hath been, to\r\nplease and divert you.” “Lookee, Sophy,” answered the squire, “I am\r\nnot to be choused in this manner. Your aunt Western would then have\r\nreason to think me the fool she doth. No, no, Sophy, I'd have you to\r\nknow I have a got more wisdom, and know more of the world, than to\r\ntake the word of a woman in a matter where a man is concerned.” “How,\r\nsir, have I deserved this want of confidence?” said she; “have I ever\r\nbroke a single promise to you? or have I ever been found guilty of a\r\nfalsehood from my cradle?” “Lookee, Sophy,” cries he; “that's neither\r\nhere nor there. I am determined upon this match, and have him you\r\nshall, d--n me if shat unt. D--n me if shat unt, though dost hang\r\nthyself the next morning.” At repeating which words he clinched his\r\nfist, knit his brows, bit his lips, and thundered so loud, that the\r\npoor afflicted, terrified Sophia sunk trembling into her chair, and,\r\nhad not a flood of tears come immediately to her relief, perhaps worse\r\nhad followed.\r\n\r\nWestern beheld the deplorable condition of his daughter with no more\r\ncontrition or remorse than the turnkey of Newgate feels at viewing the\r\nagonies of a tender wife, when taking her last farewel of her\r\ncondemned husband; or rather he looked down on her with the same\r\nemotions which arise in an honest fair tradesman, who sees his debtor\r\ndragged to prison for £10, which, though a just debt, the wretch is\r\nwickedly unable to pay. Or, to hit the case still more nearly, he felt\r\nthe same compunction with a bawd, when some poor innocent, whom she\r\nhath ensnared into her hands, falls into fits at the first proposal of\r\nwhat is called seeing company. Indeed this resemblance would be exact,\r\nwas it not that the bawd hath an interest in what she doth, and the\r\nfather, though perhaps he may blindly think otherwise, can, in\r\nreality, have none in urging his daughter to almost an equal\r\nprostitution.\r\n\r\nIn this condition he left his poor Sophia, and, departing with a very\r\nvulgar observation on the effect of tears, he locked the room, and\r\nreturned to the parson, who said everything he durst in behalf of the\r\nyoung lady, which, though perhaps it was not quite so much as his duty\r\nrequired, yet was it sufficient to throw the squire into a violent\r\nrage, and into many indecent reflections on the whole body of the\r\nclergy, which we have too great an honour for that sacred function to\r\ncommit to paper."

      "content": "What happened to Sophia during her confinement.\r\n\nThe landlady of the house where the squire lodged had begun very early\r\nto entertain a strange opinion of her guests. However, as she was\r\ninformed that the squire was a man of vast fortune, and as she had\r\ntaken care to exact a very extraordinary price for her rooms, she did\r\nnot think proper to give any offence; for, though she was not without\r\nsome concern for the confinement of poor Sophia, of whose great\r\nsweetness of temper and affability the maid of the house had made so\r\nfavourable a report, which was confirmed by all the squire's servants,\r\nyet she had much more concern for her own interest than to provoke\r\none, whom, as she said, she perceived to be a very hastish kind of a\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\nThough Sophia eat but little, yet she was regularly served with her\r\nmeals; indeed, I believe, if she had liked any one rarity, that the\r\nsquire, however angry, would have spared neither pains nor cost to\r\nhave procured it for her; since, however strange it may appear to some\r\nof my readers, he really doated on his daughter, and to give her any\r\nkind of pleasure was the highest satisfaction of his life.\r\n\r\nThe dinner-hour being arrived, Black George carried her up a pullet,\r\nthe squire himself (for he had sworn not to part with the key)\r\nattending the door. As George deposited the dish, some compliments\r\npassed between him and Sophia (for he had not seen her since she left\r\nthe country, and she treated every servant with more respect than some\r\npersons shew to those who are in a very slight degree their\r\ninferiors). Sophia would have had him take the pullet back, saying,\r\nshe could not eat; but George begged her to try, and particularly\r\nrecommended to her the eggs, of which he said it was full.\r\n\r\nAll this time the squire was waiting at the door; but George was a\r\ngreat favourite with his master, as his employment was in concerns of\r\nthe highest nature, namely, about the game, and was accustomed to take\r\nmany liberties. He had officiously carried up the dinner, being, as he\r\nsaid, very desirous to see his young lady; he made therefore no\r\nscruple of keeping his master standing above ten minutes, while\r\ncivilities were passing between him and Sophia, for which he received\r\nonly a good-humoured rebuke at the door when he returned.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of pullets, partridges, pheasants, &c., were, as George well\r\nknew, the most favourite dainties of Sophia. It was therefore no\r\nwonder that he, who was a very good-natured fellow, should take care\r\nto supply her with this kind of delicacy, at a time when all the\r\nservants in the house were afraid she would be starved; for she had\r\nscarce swallowed a single morsel in the last forty hours.\r\n\r\nThough vexation hath not the same effect on all persons as it usually\r\nhath on a widow, whose appetite it often renders sharper than it can\r\nbe rendered by the air on Bansted Downs, or Salisbury Plain; yet the\r\nsublimest grief, notwithstanding what some people may say to the\r\ncontrary, will eat at last. And Sophia, herself, after some little\r\nconsideration, began to dissect the fowl, which she found to be as\r\nfull of eggs as George had reported it.\r\n\r\nBut, if she was pleased with these, it contained something which would\r\nhave delighted the Royal Society much more; for if a fowl with three\r\nlegs be so invaluable a curiosity, when perhaps time hath produced a\r\nthousand such, at what price shall we esteem a bird which so totally\r\ncontradicts all the laws of animal oeconomy, as to contain a letter in\r\nits belly? Ovid tells us of a flower into which Hyacinthus was\r\nmetamorphosed, that bears letters on its leaves, which Virgil\r\nrecommended as a miracle to the Royal Society of his day; but no age\r\nnor nation hath ever recorded a bird with a letter in its maw.\r\n\r\nBut though a miracle of this kind might have engaged all the\r\n_Académies des Sciences_ in Europe, and perhaps in a fruitless\r\nenquiry; yet the reader, by barely recollecting the last dialogue\r\nwhich passed between Messieurs Jones and Partridge, will be very\r\neasily satisfied from whence this letter came, and how it found its\r\npassage into the fowl.\r\n\r\nSophia, notwithstanding her long fast, and notwithstanding her\r\nfavourite dish was there before her, no sooner saw the letter than she\r\nimmediately snatched it up, tore it open, and read as follows:--\r\n\r\n “MADAM,\r\n\r\n “Was I not sensible to whom I have the honour of writing, I should\r\n endeavour, however difficult, to paint the horrors of my mind at the\r\n account brought me by Mrs Honour; but as tenderness alone can have\r\n any true idea of the pangs which tenderness is capable of feeling,\r\n so can this most amiable quality, which my Sophia possesses in the\r\n most eminent degree, sufficiently inform her what her Jones must\r\n have suffered on this melancholy occasion. Is there a circumstance\r\n in the world which can heighten my agonies, when I hear of any\r\n misfortune which hath befallen you? Surely there is one only, and\r\n with that I am accursed. It is, my Sophia, the dreadful\r\n consideration that I am myself the wretched cause. Perhaps I here do\r\n myself too much honour, but none will envy me an honour which costs\r\n me so extremely dear. Pardon me this presumption, and pardon me a\r\n greater still, if I ask you, whether my advice, my assistance, my\r\n presence, my absence, my death, or my tortures can bring you any\r\n relief? Can the most perfect admiration, the most watchful\r\n observance, the most ardent love, the most melting tenderness, the\r\n most resigned submission to your will, make you amends for what you\r\n are to sacrifice to my happiness? If they can, fly, my lovely angel,\r\n to those arms which are ever open to receive and protect you; and to\r\n which, whether you bring yourself alone, or the riches of the world\r\n with you, is, in my opinion, an alternative not worth regarding. If,\r\n on the contrary, wisdom shall predominate, and, on the most mature\r\n reflection, inform you, that the sacrifice is too great; and if\r\n there be no way left to reconcile your father, and restore the peace\r\n of your dear mind, but by abandoning me, I conjure you drive me for\r\n ever from your thoughts, exert your resolution, and let no\r\n compassion for my sufferings bear the least weight in that tender\r\n bosom. Believe me, madam, I so sincerely love you better than\r\n myself, that my great and principal end is your happiness. My first\r\n wish (why would not fortune indulge me in it?) was, and pardon me if\r\n I say, still is, to see you every moment the happiest of women; my\r\n second wish is, to hear you are so; but no misery on earth can equal\r\n mine, while I think you owe an uneasy moment to him who is,\r\n\r\n Madam,\r\n in every sense, and to every purpose,\r\n your devoted,\r\n THOMAS JONES.”\r\n\r\nWhat Sophia said, or did, or thought, upon this letter, how often she\r\nread it, or whether more than once, shall all be left to our reader's\r\nimagination. The answer to it he may perhaps see hereafter, but not at\r\npresent: for this reason, among others, that she did not now write\r\nany, and that for several good causes, one of which was this, she had\r\nno paper, pen, nor ink.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, while Sophia was meditating on the letter she had\r\nreceived, or on something else, a violent noise from below disturbed\r\nher meditations. This noise was no other than a round bout at\r\naltercation between two persons. One of the combatants, by his voice,\r\nshe immediately distinguished to be her father; but she did not so\r\nsoon discover the shriller pipes to belong to the organ of her aunt\r\nWestern, who was just arrived in town, where having, by means of one\r\nof her servants, who stopt at the Hercules Pillars, learned where her\r\nbrother lodged, she drove directly to his lodgings.\r\n\r\nWe shall therefore take our leave at present of Sophia, and, with our\r\nusual good-breeding, attend her ladyship."

      "content": "In which Sophia is delivered from her confinement.\r\n\nThe squire and the parson (for the landlord was now otherwise engaged)\r\nwere smoaking their pipes together, when the arrival of the lady was\r\nfirst signified. The squire no sooner heard her name, than he\r\nimmediately ran down to usher her upstairs; for he was a great\r\nobserver of such ceremonials, especially to his sister, of whom he\r\nstood more in awe than of any other human creature, though he never\r\nwould own this, nor did he perhaps know it himself.\r\n\r\nMrs Western, on her arrival in the dining-room, having flung herself\r\ninto a chair, began thus to harangue: “Well, surely, no one ever had\r\nsuch an intolerable journey. I think the roads, since so many turnpike\r\nacts, are grown worse than ever. La, brother, how could you get into\r\nthis odious place? no person of condition, I dare swear, ever set foot\r\nhere before.” “I don't know,” cries the squire, “I think they do well\r\nenough; it was landlord recommended them. I thought, as he knew most\r\nof the quality, he could best shew me where to get among um.” “Well,\r\nand where's my niece?” says the lady; “have you been to wait upon Lady\r\nBellaston yet?” “Ay, ay,” cries the squire, “your niece is safe\r\nenough; she is upstairs in chamber.” “How!” answered the lady, “is my\r\nniece in this house, and does she not know of my being here?” “No,\r\nnobody can well get to her,” says the squire, “for she is under lock\r\nand key. I have her safe; I vetched her from my lady cousin the first\r\nnight I came to town, and I have taken care o' her ever since; she is\r\nas secure as a fox in a bag, I promise you.” “Good heaven!” returned\r\nMrs Western, “what do I hear? I thought what a fine piece of work\r\nwould be the consequence of my consent to your coming to town\r\nyourself; nay, it was indeed your own headstrong will, nor can I\r\ncharge myself with having ever consented to it. Did not you promise\r\nme, brother, that you would take none of these headstrong measures?\r\nWas it not by these headstrong measures that you forced my niece to\r\nrun away from you in the country? Have you a mind to oblige her to\r\ntake such another step?” “Z--ds and the devil!” cries the squire,\r\ndashing his pipe on the ground; “did ever mortal hear the like? when I\r\nexpected you would have commended me for all I have done, to be fallen\r\nupon in this manner!” “How, brother!” said the lady, “have I ever\r\ngiven you the least reason to imagine I should commend you for locking\r\nup your daughter? Have I not often told you that women in a free\r\ncountry are not to be treated with such arbitrary power? We are as\r\nfree as the men, and I heartily wish I could not say we deserve that\r\nfreedom better. If you expect I should stay a moment longer in this\r\nwretched house, or that I should ever own you again as my relation, or\r\nthat I should ever trouble myself again with the affairs of your\r\nfamily, I insist upon it that my niece be set at liberty this\r\ninstant.” This she spoke with so commanding an air, standing with her\r\nback to the fire, with one hand behind her, and a pinch of snuff in\r\nthe other, that I question whether Thalestris, at the head of her\r\nAmazons, ever made a more tremendous figure. It is no wonder,\r\ntherefore, that the poor squire was not proof against the awe which\r\nshe inspired. “There,” he cried, throwing down the key, “there it is,\r\ndo whatever you please. I intended only to have kept her up till\r\nBlifil came to town, which can't be long; and now if any harm happens\r\nin the mean time, remember who is to be blamed for it.”\r\n\r\n“I will answer it with my life,” cried Mrs Western, “but I shall not\r\nintermeddle at all, unless upon one condition, and that is, that you\r\nwill commit the whole entirely to my care, without taking any one\r\nmeasure yourself, unless I shall eventually appoint you to act. If you\r\nratify these preliminaries, brother, I yet will endeavour to preserve\r\nthe honour of your family; if not, I shall continue in a neutral\r\nstate.”\r\n\r\n“I pray you, good sir,” said the parson, “permit yourself this once to\r\nbe admonished by her ladyship: peradventure, by communing with young\r\nMadam Sophia, she will effect more than you have been able to\r\nperpetrate by more rigorous measures.”\r\n\r\n“What, dost thee open upon me?” cries the squire: “if thee dost begin\r\nto babble, I shall whip thee in presently.”\r\n\r\n“Fie, brother,” answered the lady, “is this language to a clergyman?\r\nMr Supple is a man of sense, and gives you the best advice; and the\r\nwhole world, I believe, will concur in his opinion; but I must tell\r\nyou I expect an immediate answer to my categorical proposals. Either\r\ncede your daughter to my disposal, or take her wholly to your own\r\nsurprizing discretion, and then I here, before Mr Supple, evacuate the\r\ngarrison, and renounce you and your family for ever.”\r\n\r\n“I pray you let me be a mediator,” cries the parson, “let me\r\nsupplicate you.”\r\n\r\n“Why, there lies the key on the table,” cries the squire. “She may\r\ntake un up, if she pleases: who hinders her?”\r\n\r\n“No, brother,” answered the lady, “I insist on the formality of its\r\nbeing delivered me, with a full ratification of all the concessions\r\nstipulated.”\r\n\r\n“Why then I will deliver it to you.--There 'tis,” cries the squire. “I\r\nam sure, sister, you can't accuse me of ever denying to trust my\r\ndaughter to you. She hath a-lived wi' you a whole year and muore to a\r\ntime, without my ever zeeing her.”\r\n\r\n“And it would have been happy for her,” answered the lady, “if she had\r\nalways lived with me. Nothing of this kind would have happened under\r\nmy eye.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, certainly,” cries he, “I only am to blame.”\r\n\r\n“Why, you are to blame, brother,” answered she. “I have been often\r\nobliged to tell you so, and shall always be obliged to tell you so.\r\nHowever, I hope you will now amend, and gather so much experience from\r\npast errors, as not to defeat my wisest machinations by your blunders.\r\nIndeed, brother, you are not qualified for these negociations. All\r\nyour whole scheme of politics is wrong. I once more, therefore,\r\ninsist, that you do not intermeddle. Remember only what is past.”----\r\n\r\n“Z--ds and bl--d, sister,” cries the squire, “what would you have me\r\nsay? You are enough to provoke the devil.”\r\n\r\n“There, now,” said she, “just according to the old custom. I see,\r\nbrother, there is no talking to you. I will appeal to Mr Supple, who\r\nis a man of sense, if I said anything which could put any human\r\ncreature into a passion; but you are so wrongheaded every way.”\r\n\r\n“Let me beg you, madam,” said the parson, “not to irritate his\r\nworship.”\r\n\r\n“Irritate him?” said the lady; “sure, you are as great a fool as\r\nhimself. Well, brother, since you have promised not to interfere, I\r\nwill once more undertake the management of my niece. Lord have mercy\r\nupon all affairs which are under the directions of men! The head of\r\none woman is worth a thousand of yours.” And now having summoned a\r\nservant to show her to Sophia, she departed, bearing the key with her.\r\n\r\nShe was no sooner gone, than the squire (having first shut the door)\r\nejaculated twenty bitches, and as many hearty curses against her, not\r\nsparing himself for having ever thought of her estate; but added, “Now\r\none hath been a slave so long, it would be pity to lose it at last,\r\nfor want of holding out a little longer. The bitch can't live for\r\never, and I know I am down for it upon the will.”\r\n\r\nThe parson greatly commended this resolution: and now the squire\r\nhaving ordered in another bottle, which was his usual method when\r\nanything either pleased or vexed him, did, by drinking plentifully of\r\nthis medicinal julap, so totally wash away his choler, that his temper\r\nwas become perfectly placid and serene, when Mrs Western returned with\r\nSophia into the room. The young lady had on her hat and capuchin, and\r\nthe aunt acquainted Mr Western, “that she intended to take her niece\r\nwith her to her own lodgings; for, indeed, brother,” says she, “these\r\nrooms are not fit to receive a Christian soul in.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, madam,” quoth Western, “whatever you please. The girl can\r\nnever be in better hands than yours; and the parson here can do me the\r\njustice to say, that I have said fifty times behind your back, that\r\nyou was one of the most sensible women in the world.”\r\n\r\n“To this,” cries the parson, “I am ready to bear testimony.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, brother,” says Mrs Western, “I have always, I'm sure, given you\r\nas favourable a character. You must own you have a little too much\r\nhastiness in your temper; but when you will allow yourself time to\r\nreflect I never knew a man more reasonable.”\r\n\r\n“Why then, sister, if you think so,” said the squire, “here's your\r\ngood health with all my heart. I am a little passionate sometimes, but\r\nI scorn to bear any malice. Sophy, do you be a good girl, and do\r\neverything your aunt orders you.”\r\n\r\n“I have not the least doubt of her,” answered Mrs Western. “She hath\r\nhad already an example before her eyes in the behaviour of that wretch\r\nher cousin Harriet, who ruined herself by neglecting my advice. O\r\nbrother, what think you? You was hardly gone out of hearing, when you\r\nset out for London, when who should arrive but that impudent fellow\r\nwith the odious Irish name--that Fitzpatrick. He broke in abruptly\r\nupon me without notice, or I would not have seen him. He ran on a\r\nlong, unintelligible story about his wife, to which he forced me to\r\ngive him a hearing; but I made him very little answer, and delivered\r\nhim the letter from his wife, which I bid him answer himself. I\r\nsuppose the wretch will endeavour to find us out, but I beg you will\r\nnot see her, for I am determined I will not.”\r\n\r\n“I zee her!” answered the squire; “you need not fear me. I'll ge no\r\nencouragement to such undutiful wenches. It is well for the fellow,\r\nher husband, I was not at huome. Od rabbit it, he should have taken a\r\ndance thru the horse-pond, I promise un. You zee, Sophy, what\r\nundutifulness brings volks to. You have an example in your own\r\nfamily.”\r\n\r\n“Brother,” cries the aunt, “you need not shock my niece by such odious\r\nrepetitions. Why will you not leave everything entirely to me?” “Well,\r\nwell, I wull, I wull,” said the squire.\r\n\r\nAnd now Mrs Western, luckily for Sophia, put an end to the\r\nconversation by ordering chairs to be called. I say luckily, for had\r\nit continued much longer, fresh matter of dissension would, most\r\nprobably, have arisen between the brother and sister; between whom\r\neducation and sex made the only difference; for both were equally\r\nviolent and equally positive: they had both a vast affection for\r\nSophia, and both a sovereign contempt for each other."

      "content": "In which Jones receives a letter from Sophia, and goes to a play with\r\nMrs Miller and Partridge.\r\n\nThe arrival of Black George in town, and the good offices which that\r\ngrateful fellow had promised to do for his old benefactor, greatly\r\ncomforted Jones in the midst of all the anxiety and uneasiness which\r\nhe had suffered on the account of Sophia; from whom, by the means of\r\nthe said George, he received the following answer to his letter, which\r\nSophia, to whom the use of pen, ink, and paper was restored with her\r\nliberty, wrote the very evening when she departed from her\r\nconfinement:\r\n\r\n “Sir,\r\n\r\n “As I do not doubt your sincerity in what you write, you will be\r\n pleased to hear that some of my afflictions are at an end, by the\r\n arrival of my aunt Western, with whom I am at present, and with whom\r\n I enjoy all the liberty I can desire. One promise my aunt hath\r\n insisted on my making, which is, that I will not see or converse\r\n with any person without her knowledge and consent. This promise I\r\n have most solemnly given, and shall most inviolably keep: and though\r\n she hath not expressly forbidden me writing, yet that must be an\r\n omission from forgetfulness; or this, perhaps, is included in the\r\n word conversing. However, as I cannot but consider this as a breach\r\n of her generous confidence in my honour, you cannot expect that I\r\n shall, after this, continue to write myself or to receive letters,\r\n without her knowledge. A promise is with me a very sacred thing, and\r\n to be extended to everything understood from it, as well as to what\r\n is expressed by it; and this consideration may, perhaps, on\r\n reflection, afford you some comfort. But why should I mention a\r\n comfort to you of this kind; for though there is one thing in which\r\n I can never comply with the best of fathers, yet am I firmly\r\n resolved never to act in defiance of him, or to take any step of\r\n consequence without his consent. A firm persuasion of this must\r\n teach you to divert your thoughts from what fortune hath (perhaps)\r\n made impossible. This your own interest persuades you. This may\r\n reconcile, I hope, Mr Allworthy to you; and if it will, you have my\r\n injunctions to pursue it. Accidents have laid some obligations on\r\n me, and your good intentions probably more. Fortune may, perhaps, be\r\n some time kinder to us both than at present. Believe this, that I\r\n shall always think of you as I think you deserve, and am,\r\n\r\n Sir,\r\n your obliged humble servant,\r\n Sophia Western.\r\n\r\n “I charge you write to me no more--at present at least; and accept\r\n this, which is now of no service to me, which I know you must want,\r\n and think you owe the trifle only to that fortune by which you found\r\n it.”[*]\r\n\r\n [*] Meaning, perhaps, the bank-bill for £100.\r\n\r\nA child who hath just learnt his letters would have spelt this letter\r\nout in less time than Jones took in reading it. The sensations it\r\noccasioned were a mixture of joy and grief; somewhat like what divide\r\nthe mind of a good man when he peruses the will of his deceased\r\nfriend, in which a large legacy, which his distresses make the more\r\nwelcome, is bequeathed to him. Upon the whole, however, he was more\r\npleased than displeased; and, indeed, the reader may probably wonder\r\nthat he was displeased at all; but the reader is not quite so much in\r\nlove as was poor Jones; and love is a disease which, though it may, in\r\nsome instances, resemble a consumption (which it sometimes causes), in\r\nothers proceeds in direct opposition to it, and particularly in this,\r\nthat it never flatters itself, or sees any one symptom in a favourable\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nOne thing gave him complete satisfaction, which was, that his mistress\r\nhad regained her liberty, and was now with a lady where she might at\r\nleast assure herself of a decent treatment. Another comfortable\r\ncircumstance was the reference which she made to her promise of never\r\nmarrying any other man; for however disinterested he might imagine his\r\npassion, and notwithstanding all the generous overtures made in his\r\nletter, I very much question whether he could have heard a more\r\nafflicting piece of news than that Sophia was married to another,\r\nthough the match had been never so great, and never so likely to end\r\nin making her completely happy. That refined degree of Platonic\r\naffection which is absolutely detached from the flesh, and is, indeed,\r\nentirely and purely spiritual, is a gift confined to the female part\r\nof the creation; many of whom I have heard declare (and, doubtless,\r\nwith great truth), that they would, with the utmost readiness, resign\r\na lover to a rival, when such resignation was proved to be necessary\r\nfor the temporal interest of such lover. Hence, therefore, I conclude\r\nthat this affection is in nature, though I cannot pretend to say I\r\nhave ever seen an instance of it.\r\n\r\nMr Jones having spent three hours in reading and kissing the aforesaid\r\nletter, and being, at last, in a state of good spirits, from the\r\nlast-mentioned considerations, he agreed to carry an appointment,\r\nwhich he had before made, into execution. This was, to attend Mrs\r\nMiller, and her younger daughter, into the gallery at the play-house,\r\nand to admit Mr Partridge as one of the company. For as Jones had\r\nreally that taste for humour which many affect, he expected to enjoy\r\nmuch entertainment in the criticisms of Partridge, from whom he\r\nexpected the simple dictates of nature, unimproved, indeed, but\r\nlikewise unadulterated, by art.\r\n\r\nIn the first row then of the first gallery did Mr Jones, Mrs Miller,\r\nher youngest daughter, and Partridge, take their places. Partridge\r\nimmediately declared it was the finest place he had ever been in. When\r\nthe first music was played, he said, “It was a wonder how so many\r\nfiddlers could play at one time, without putting one another out.”\r\n While the fellow was lighting the upper candles, he cried out to Mrs\r\nMiller, “Look, look, madam, the very picture of the man in the end of\r\nthe common-prayer book before the gunpowder-treason service.” Nor\r\ncould he help observing, with a sigh, when all the candles were\r\nlighted, “That here were candles enough burnt in one night, to keep an\r\nhonest poor family for a whole twelvemonth.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as the play, which was Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, began,\r\nPartridge was all attention, nor did he break silence till the\r\nentrance of the ghost; upon which he asked Jones, “What man that was\r\nin the strange dress; something,” said he, “like what I have seen in a\r\npicture. Sure it is not armour, is it?” Jones answered, “That is the\r\nghost.” To which Partridge replied with a smile, “Persuade me to that,\r\nsir, if you can. Though I can't say I ever actually saw a ghost in my\r\nlife, yet I am certain I should know one, if I saw him, better than\r\nthat comes to. No, no, sir, ghosts don't appear in such dresses as\r\nthat, neither.” In this mistake, which caused much laughter in the\r\nneighbourhood of Partridge, he was suffered to continue, till the\r\nscene between the ghost and Hamlet, when Partridge gave that credit to\r\nMr Garrick, which he had denied to Jones, and fell into so violent a\r\ntrembling, that his knees knocked against each other. Jones asked him\r\nwhat was the matter, and whether he was afraid of the warrior upon the\r\nstage? “O la! sir,” said he, “I perceive now it is what you told me. I\r\nam not afraid of anything; for I know it is but a play. And if it was\r\nreally a ghost, it could do one no harm at such a distance, and in so\r\nmuch company; and yet if I was frightened, I am not the only person.”\r\n “Why, who,” cries Jones, “dost thou take to be such a coward here\r\nbesides thyself?” “Nay, you may call me coward if you will; but if\r\nthat little man there upon the stage is not frightened, I never saw\r\nany man frightened in my life. Ay, ay: go along with you: Ay, to be\r\nsure! Who's fool then? Will you? Lud have mercy upon such\r\nfool-hardiness!--Whatever happens, it is good enough for\r\nyou.----Follow you? I'd follow the devil as soon. Nay, perhaps it is\r\nthe devil----for they say he can put on what likeness he pleases.--Oh!\r\nhere he is again.----No farther! No, you have gone far enough already;\r\nfarther than I'd have gone for all the king's dominions.” Jones\r\noffered to speak, but Partridge cried “Hush, hush! dear sir, don't you\r\nhear him?” And during the whole speech of the ghost, he sat with his\r\neyes fixed partly on the ghost and partly on Hamlet, and with his\r\nmouth open; the same passions which succeeded each other in Hamlet,\r\nsucceeding likewise in him.\r\n\r\nWhen the scene was over Jones said, “Why, Partridge, you exceed my\r\nexpectations. You enjoy the play more than I conceived possible.”\r\n “Nay, sir,” answered Partridge, “if you are not afraid of the devil, I\r\ncan't help it; but to be sure, it is natural to be surprized at such\r\nthings, though I know there is nothing in them: not that it was the\r\nghost that surprized me, neither; for I should have known that to have\r\nbeen only a man in a strange dress; but when I saw the little man so\r\nfrightened himself, it was that which took hold of me.” “And dost thou\r\nimagine, then, Partridge,” cries Jones, “that he was really\r\nfrightened?” “Nay, sir,” said Partridge, “did not you yourself observe\r\nafterwards, when he found it was his own father's spirit, and how he\r\nwas murdered in the garden, how his fear forsook him by degrees, and\r\nhe was struck dumb with sorrow, as it were, just as I should have\r\nbeen, had it been my own case?--But hush! O la! what noise is that?\r\nThere he is again.----Well, to be certain, though I know there is\r\nnothing at all in it, I am glad I am not down yonder, where those men\r\nare.” Then turning his eyes again upon Hamlet, “Ay, you may draw your\r\nsword; what signifies a sword against the power of the devil?”\r\n\r\nDuring the second act, Partridge made very few remarks. He greatly\r\nadmired the fineness of the dresses; nor could he help observing upon\r\nthe king's countenance. “Well,” said he, “how people may be deceived\r\nby faces! _Nulla fides fronti_ is, I find, a true saying. Who would\r\nthink, by looking in the king's face, that he had ever committed a\r\nmurder?” He then enquired after the ghost; but Jones, who intended he\r\nshould be surprized, gave him no other satisfaction, than, “that he\r\nmight possibly see him again soon, and in a flash of fire.”\r\n\r\nPartridge sat in a fearful expectation of this; and now, when the\r\nghost made his next appearance, Partridge cried out, “There, sir, now;\r\nwhat say you now? is he frightened now or no? As much frightened as\r\nyou think me, and, to be sure, nobody can help some fears. I would not\r\nbe in so bad a condition as what's his name, squire Hamlet, is there,\r\nfor all the world. Bless me! what's become of the spirit? As I am a\r\nliving soul, I thought I saw him sink into the earth.” “Indeed, you\r\nsaw right,” answered Jones. “Well, well,” cries Partridge, “I know it\r\nis only a play: and besides, if there was anything in all this, Madam\r\nMiller would not laugh so; for as to you, sir, you would not be\r\nafraid, I believe, if the devil was here in person.--There, there--Ay,\r\nno wonder you are in such a passion, shake the vile wicked wretch to\r\npieces. If she was my own mother, I would serve her so. To be sure all\r\nduty to a mother is forfeited by such wicked doings.----Ay, go about\r\nyour business, I hate the sight of you.”\r\n\r\nOur critic was now pretty silent till the play, which Hamlet\r\nintroduces before the king. This he did not at first understand, till\r\nJones explained it to him; but he no sooner entered into the spirit of\r\nit, than he began to bless himself that he had never committed murder.\r\nThen turning to Mrs Miller, he asked her, “If she did not imagine the\r\nking looked as if he was touched; though he is,” said he, “a good\r\nactor, and doth all he can to hide it. Well, I would not have so much\r\nto answer for, as that wicked man there hath, to sit upon a much\r\nhigher chair than he sits upon. No wonder he ran away; for your sake\r\nI'll never trust an innocent face again.”\r\n\r\nThe grave-digging scene next engaged the attention of Partridge, who\r\nexpressed much surprize at the number of skulls thrown upon the stage.\r\nTo which Jones answered, “That it was one of the most famous\r\nburial-places about town.” “No wonder then,” cries Partridge, “that\r\nthe place is haunted. But I never saw in my life a worse grave-digger.\r\nI had a sexton, when I was clerk, that should have dug three graves\r\nwhile he is digging one. The fellow handles a spade as if it was the\r\nfirst time he had ever had one in his hand. Ay, ay, you may sing. You\r\nhad rather sing than work, I believe.”--Upon Hamlet's taking up the\r\nskull, he cried out, “Well! it is strange to see how fearless some men\r\nare: I never could bring myself to touch anything belonging to a dead\r\nman, on any account.--He seemed frightened enough too at the ghost, I\r\nthought. _Nemo omnibus horis sapit._”\r\n\r\nLittle more worth remembering occurred during the play, at the end of\r\nwhich Jones asked him, “Which of the players he had liked best?” To\r\nthis he answered, with some appearance of indignation at the question,\r\n“The king, without doubt.” “Indeed, Mr Partridge,” says Mrs Miller,\r\n“you are not of the same opinion with the town; for they are all\r\nagreed, that Hamlet is acted by the best player who ever was on the\r\nstage.” “He the best player!” cries Partridge, with a contemptuous\r\nsneer, “why, I could act as well as he myself. I am sure, if I had\r\nseen a ghost, I should have looked in the very same manner, and done\r\njust as he did. And then, to be sure, in that scene, as you called it,\r\nbetween him and his mother, where you told me he acted so fine, why,\r\nLord help me, any man, that is, any good man, that had such a mother,\r\nwould have done exactly the same. I know you are only joking with me;\r\nbut indeed, madam, though I was never at a play in London, yet I have\r\nseen acting before in the country; and the king for my money; he\r\nspeaks all his words distinctly, half as loud again as the\r\nother.--Anybody may see he is an actor.”\r\n\r\nWhile Mrs Miller was thus engaged in conversation with Partridge, a\r\nlady came up to Mr Jones, whom he immediately knew to be Mrs\r\nFitzpatrick. She said, she had seen him from the other part of the\r\ngallery, and had taken that opportunity of speaking to him, as she had\r\nsomething to say, which might be of great service to himself. She then\r\nacquainted him with her lodgings, and made him an appointment the next\r\nday in the morning; which, upon recollection, she presently changed to\r\nthe afternoon; at which time Jones promised to attend her.\r\n\r\nThus ended the adventure at the playhouse; where Partridge had\r\nafforded great mirth, not only to Jones and Mrs Miller, but to all who\r\nsat within hearing, who were more attentive to what he said, than to\r\nanything that passed on the stage.\r\n\r\nHe durst not go to bed all that night, for fear of the ghost; and for\r\nmany nights after sweated two or three hours before he went to sleep,\r\nwith the same apprehensions, and waked several times in great horrors,\r\ncrying out, “Lord have mercy upon us! there it is.”"

      "content": "In which the history is obliged to look back.\r\n\nIt is almost impossible for the best parent to observe an exact\r\nimpartiality to his children, even though no superior merit should\r\nbias his affection; but sure a parent can hardly be blamed, when that\r\nsuperiority determines his preference.\r\n\r\nAs I regard all the personages of this history in the light of my\r\nchildren; so I must confess the same inclination of partiality to\r\nSophia; and for that I hope the reader will allow me the same excuse,\r\nfrom the superiority of her character.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary tenderness which I have for my heroine never\r\nsuffers me to quit her any long time without the utmost reluctance. I\r\ncould now, therefore, return impatiently to enquire what hath happened\r\nto this lovely creature since her departure from her father's, but\r\nthat I am obliged first to pay a short visit to Mr Blifil.\r\n\r\nMr Western, in the first confusion into which his mind was cast upon\r\nthe sudden news he received of his daughter, and in the first hurry to\r\ngo after her, had not once thought of sending any account of the\r\ndiscovery to Blifil. He had not gone far, however, before he\r\nrecollected himself, and accordingly stopt at the very first inn he\r\ncame to, and dispatched away a messenger to acquaint Blifil with his\r\nhaving found Sophia, and with his firm resolution to marry her to him\r\nimmediately, if he would come up after him to town.\r\n\r\nAs the love which Blifil had for Sophia was of that violent kind,\r\nwhich nothing but the loss of her fortune, or some such accident,\r\ncould lessen, his inclination to the match was not at all altered by\r\nher having run away, though he was obliged to lay this to his own\r\naccount. He very readily, therefore, embraced this offer. Indeed, he\r\nnow proposed the gratification of a very strong passion besides\r\navarice, by marrying this young lady, and this was hatred; for he\r\nconcluded that matrimony afforded an equal opportunity of satisfying\r\neither hatred or love; and this opinion is very probably verified by\r\nmuch experience. To say the truth, if we are to judge by the ordinary\r\nbehaviour of married persons to each other, we shall perhaps be apt to\r\nconclude that the generality seek the indulgence of the former passion\r\nonly, in their union of everything but of hearts.\r\n\r\nThere was one difficulty, however, in his way, and this arose from Mr\r\nAllworthy. That good man, when he found by the departure of Sophia\r\n(for neither that, nor the cause of it, could be concealed from him),\r\nthe great aversion which she had for his nephew, began to be seriously\r\nconcerned that he had been deceived into carrying matters so far. He\r\nby no means concurred with the opinion of those parents, who think it\r\nas immaterial to consult the inclinations of their children in the\r\naffair of marriage, as to solicit the good pleasure of their servants\r\nwhen they intend to take a journey; and who are by law, or decency at\r\nleast, withheld often from using absolute force. On the contrary, as\r\nhe esteemed the institution to be of the most sacred kind, he thought\r\nevery preparatory caution necessary to preserve it holy and inviolate;\r\nand very wisely concluded, that the surest way to effect this was by\r\nlaying the foundation in previous affection.\r\n\r\nBlifil indeed soon cured his uncle of all anger on the score of\r\ndeceit, by many vows and protestations that he had been deceived\r\nhimself, with which the many declarations of Western very well\r\ntallied; but now to persuade Allworthy to consent to the renewing his\r\naddresses was a matter of such apparent difficulty, that the very\r\nappearance was sufficient to have deterred a less enterprizing genius;\r\nbut this young gentleman so well knew his own talents, that nothing\r\nwithin the province of cunning seemed to him hard to be achieved.\r\n\r\nHere then he represented the violence of his own affection, and the\r\nhopes of subduing aversion in the lady by perseverance. He begged\r\nthat, in an affair on which depended all his future repose, he might\r\nat least be at liberty to try all fair means for success. Heaven\r\nforbid, he said, that he should ever think of prevailing by any other\r\nthan the most gentle methods! “Besides, sir,” said he, “if they fail,\r\nyou may then (which will be surely time enough) deny your consent.” He\r\nurged the great and eager desire which Mr Western had for the match;\r\nand lastly, he made great use of the name of Jones, to whom he imputed\r\nall that had happened; and from whom, he said, to preserve so valuable\r\na young lady was even an act of charity.\r\n\r\nAll these arguments were well seconded by Thwackum, who dwelt a little\r\nstronger on the authority of parents than Mr Blifil himself had done.\r\nHe ascribed the measures which Mr Blifil was desirous to take to\r\nChristian motives; “and though,” says he, “the good young gentleman\r\nhath mentioned charity last, I am almost convinced it is his first and\r\nprincipal consideration.”\r\n\r\nSquare, possibly, had he been present, would have sung to the same\r\ntune, though in a different key, and would have discovered much moral\r\nfitness in the proceeding: but he was now gone to Bath for the\r\nrecovery of his health.\r\n\r\nAllworthy, though not without reluctance, at last yielded to the\r\ndesires of his nephew. He said he would accompany him to London, where\r\nhe might be at liberty to use every honest endeavour to gain the lady:\r\n“But I declare,” said he, “I will never give my consent to any\r\nabsolute force being put on her inclinations, nor shall you ever have\r\nher, unless she can be brought freely to compliance.”\r\n\r\nThus did the affection of Allworthy for his nephew betray the superior\r\nunderstanding to be triumphed over by the inferior; and thus is the\r\nprudence of the best of heads often defeated by the tenderness of the\r\nbest of hearts.\r\n\r\nBlifil, having obtained this unhoped-for acquiescence in his uncle,\r\nrested not till he carried his purpose into execution. And as no\r\nimmediate business required Mr Allworthy's presence in the country,\r\nand little preparation is necessary to men for a journey, they set out\r\nthe very next day, and arrived in town that evening, when Mr Jones, as\r\nwe have seen, was diverting himself with Partridge at the play.\r\n\r\nThe morning after his arrival Mr Blifil waited on Mr Western, by whom\r\nhe was most kindly and graciously received, and from whom he had every\r\npossible assurance (perhaps more than was possible) that he should\r\nvery shortly be as happy as Sophia could make him; nor would the\r\nsquire suffer the young gentleman to return to his uncle till he had,\r\nalmost against his will, carried him to his sister."

      "content": "In which Mr Western pays a visit to his sister, in company with Mr\r\nBlifil.\r\n\nMrs Western was reading a lecture on prudence, and matrimonial\r\npolitics, to her niece, when her brother and Blifil broke in with less\r\nceremony than the laws of visiting require. Sophia no sooner saw\r\nBlifil than she turned pale, and almost lost the use of all her\r\nfaculties; but her aunt, on the contrary, waxed red, and, having all\r\nher faculties at command, began to exert her tongue on the squire.\r\n\r\n“Brother,” said she, “I am astonished at your behaviour; will you\r\nnever learn any regard to decorum? Will you still look upon every\r\napartment as your own, or as belonging to one of your country tenants?\r\nDo you think yourself at liberty to invade the privacies of women of\r\ncondition, without the least decency or notice?”----“Why, what a pox\r\nis the matter now?” quoth the squire; “one would think I had caught\r\nyou at--“--“None of your brutality, sir, I beseech you,” answered\r\nshe.----“You have surprized my poor niece so, that she can hardly, I\r\nsee, support herself.----Go, my dear, retire, and endeavour to recruit\r\nyour spirits; for I see you have occasion.” At which words Sophia, who\r\nnever received a more welcome command, hastily withdrew.\r\n\r\n“To be sure, sister,” cries the squire, “you are mad, when I have\r\nbrought Mr Blifil here to court her, to force her away.”\r\n\r\n“Sure, brother,” says she, “you are worse than mad, when you know in\r\nwhat situation affairs are, to----I am sure I ask Mr Blifil's pardon,\r\nbut he knows very well to whom to impute so disagreeable a reception.\r\nFor my own part, I am sure I shall always be very glad to see Mr\r\nBlifil; but his own good sense would not have suffered him to proceed\r\nso abruptly, had you not compelled him to it.”\r\n\r\nBlifil bowed and stammered, and looked like a fool; but Western,\r\nwithout giving him time to form a speech for the purpose, answered,\r\n“Well, well, I am to blame, if you will, I always am, certainly; but\r\ncome, let the girl be fetched back again, or let Mr Blifil go to\r\nher.----He's come up on purpose, and there is no time to be lost.”\r\n\r\n“Brother,” cries Mrs Western, “Mr Blifil, I am confident, understands\r\nhimself better than to think of seeing my niece any more this morning,\r\nafter what hath happened. Women are of a nice contexture; and our\r\nspirits, when disordered, are not to be recomposed in a moment. Had\r\nyou suffered Mr Blifil to have sent his compliments to my niece, and\r\nto have desired the favour of waiting on her in the afternoon, I\r\nshould possibly have prevailed on her to have seen him; but now I\r\ndespair of bringing about any such matter.”\r\n\r\n“I am very sorry, madam,” cried Blifil, “that Mr Western's\r\nextraordinary kindness to me, which I can never enough acknowledge,\r\nshould have occasioned--” “Indeed, sir,” said she, interrupting him,\r\n“you need make no apologies, we all know my brother so well.”\r\n\r\n“I don't care what anybody knows of me,” answered the squire;----“but\r\nwhen must he come to see her? for, consider, I tell you, he is come\r\nup on purpose, and so is Allworthy.”--“Brother,” said she, “whatever\r\nmessage Mr Blifil thinks proper to send to my niece shall be\r\ndelivered to her; and I suppose she will want no instructions to make\r\na proper answer. I am convinced she will not refuse to see Mr Blifil\r\nat a proper time.”--“The devil she won't!” answered the\r\nsquire.--“Odsbud!--Don't we know--I say nothing, but some volk are\r\nwiser than all the world.----If I might have had my will, she had not\r\nrun away before: and now I expect to hear every moment she is guone\r\nagain. For as great a fool as some volk think me, I know very well\r\nshe hates----” “No matter, brother,” replied Mrs Western, “I will not\r\nhear my niece abused. It is a reflection on my family. She is an\r\nhonour to it; and she will be an honour to it, I promise you. I will\r\npawn my whole reputation in the world on her conduct.----I shall be\r\nglad to see you, brother, in the afternoon; for I have somewhat of\r\nimportance to mention to you.--At present, Mr Blifil, as well as you,\r\nmust excuse me; for I am in haste to dress.” “Well, but,” said the\r\nsquire, “do appoint a time.” “Indeed,” said she, “I can appoint no\r\ntime. I tell you I will see you in the afternoon.”--“What the devil\r\nwould you have me do?” cries the squire, turning to Blifil; “I can no\r\nmore turn her, than a beagle can turn an old hare. Perhaps she will\r\nbe in a better humour in the afternoon.”--“I am condemned, I see,\r\nsir, to misfortune,” answered Blifil; “but I shall always own my\r\nobligations to you.” He then took a ceremonious leave of Mrs Western,\r\nwho was altogether as ceremonious on her part; and then they\r\ndeparted, the squire muttering to himself with an oath, that Blifil\r\nshould see his daughter in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nIf Mr Western was little pleased with this interview, Blifil was less.\r\nAs to the former, he imputed the whole behaviour of his sister to her\r\nhumour only, and to her dissatisfaction at the omission of ceremony in\r\nthe visit; but Blifil saw a little deeper into things. He suspected\r\nsomewhat of more consequence, from two or three words which dropt from\r\nthe lady; and, to say the truth, he suspected right, as will appear\r\nwhen I have unfolded the several matters which will be contained in\r\nthe following chapter."

      "content": "Schemes of Lady Bellaston for the ruin of Jones.\r\n\nLove had taken too deep a root in the mind of Lord Fellamar to be\r\nplucked up by the rude hands of Mr Western. In the heat of resentment\r\nhe had, indeed, given a commission to Captain Egglane, which the\r\ncaptain had far exceeded in the execution; nor had it been executed at\r\nall, had his lordship been able to find the captain after he had seen\r\nLady Bellaston, which was in the afternoon of the day after he had\r\nreceived the affront; but so industrious was the captain in the\r\ndischarge of his duty, that, having after long enquiry found out the\r\nsquire's lodgings very late in the evening, he sat up all night at a\r\ntavern, that he might not miss the squire in the morning, and by that\r\nmeans missed the revocation which my lord had sent to his lodgings.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon then next after the intended rape of Sophia, his\r\nlordship, as we have said, made a visit to Lady Bellaston, who laid\r\nopen so much of the character of the squire, that his lordship plainly\r\nsaw the absurdity he had been guilty of in taking any offence at his\r\nwords, especially as he had those honourable designs on his daughter.\r\nHe then unbosomed the violence of his passion to Lady Bellaston, who\r\nreadily undertook the cause, and encouraged him with certain assurance\r\nof a most favourable reception from all the elders of the family, and\r\nfrom the father himself when he should be sober, and should be made\r\nacquainted with the nature of the offer made to his daughter. The only\r\ndanger, she said, lay in the fellow she had formerly mentioned, who,\r\nthough a beggar and a vagabond, had, by some means or other, she knew\r\nnot what, procured himself tolerable cloaths, and past for a\r\ngentleman. “Now,” says she, “as I have, for the sake of my cousin,\r\nmade it my business to enquire after this fellow, I have luckily found\r\nout his lodgings;” with which she then acquainted his lordship. “I am\r\nthinking, my lord,” added she “(for this fellow is too mean for your\r\npersonal resentment), whether it would not be possible for your\r\nlordship to contrive some method of having him pressed and sent on\r\nboard a ship. Neither law nor conscience forbid this project: for the\r\nfellow, I promise you, however well drest, is but a vagabond, and as\r\nproper as any fellow in the streets to be pressed into the service;\r\nand as for the conscientious part, surely the preservation of a young\r\nlady from such ruin is a most meritorious act; nay, with regard to the\r\nfellow himself, unless he could succeed (which Heaven forbid) with my\r\ncousin, it may probably be the means of preserving him from the\r\ngallows, and perhaps may make his fortune in an honest way.”\r\n\r\nLord Fellamar very heartily thanked her ladyship for the part which\r\nshe was pleased to take in the affair, upon the success of which his\r\nwhole future happiness entirely depended. He said, he saw at present\r\nno objection to the pressing scheme, and would consider of putting it\r\nin execution. He then most earnestly recommended to her ladyship to do\r\nhim the honour of immediately mentioning his proposals to the family;\r\nto whom he said he offered a _carte blanche_, and would settle his\r\nfortune in almost any manner they should require. And after uttering\r\nmany ecstasies and raptures concerning Sophia, he took his leave and\r\ndeparted, but not before he had received the strongest charge to\r\nbeware of Jones, and to lose no time in securing his person, where he\r\nshould no longer be in a capacity of making any attempts to the ruin\r\nof the young lady.\r\n\r\nThe moment Mrs Western was arrived at her lodgings, a card was\r\ndespatched with her compliments to Lady Bellaston; who no sooner\r\nreceived it than, with the impatience of a lover, she flew to her\r\ncousin, rejoiced at this fair opportunity, which beyond her hopes\r\noffered itself, for she was much better pleased with the prospect of\r\nmaking the proposals to a woman of sense, and who knew the world, than\r\nto a gentleman whom she honoured with the appellation of Hottentot;\r\nthough, indeed, from him she apprehended no danger of a refusal.\r\n\r\nThe two ladies being met, after very short previous ceremonials, fell\r\nto business, which was indeed almost as soon concluded as begun; for\r\nMrs Western no sooner heard the name of Lord Fellamar than her cheeks\r\nglowed with pleasure; but when she was acquainted with the eagerness\r\nof his passion, the earnestness of his proposals, and the generosity\r\nof his offer, she declared her full satisfaction in the most explicit\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nIn the progress of their conversation their discourse turned to Jones,\r\nand both cousins very pathetically lamented the unfortunate attachment\r\nwhich both agreed Sophia had to that young fellow; and Mrs Western\r\nentirely attributed it to the folly of her brother's management. She\r\nconcluded, however, at last, with declaring her confidence in the good\r\nunderstanding of her niece, who, though she would not give up her\r\naffection in favour of Blifil, will, I doubt not, says she, soon be\r\nprevailed upon to sacrifice a simple inclination to the addresses of a\r\nfine gentleman, who brings her both a title and a large estate: “For,\r\nindeed,” added she, “I must do Sophy the justice to confess this\r\nBlifil is but a hideous kind of fellow, as you know, Bellaston, all\r\ncountry gentlemen are, and hath nothing but his fortune to recommend\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“Nay,” said Lady Bellaston, “I don't then so much wonder at my cousin;\r\nfor I promise you this Jones is a very agreeable fellow, and hath one\r\nvirtue, which the men say is a great recommendation to us. What do you\r\nthink, Mrs Western--I shall certainly make you laugh; nay, I can\r\nhardly tell you myself for laughing--will you believe that the fellow\r\nhath had the assurance to make love to me? But if you should be\r\ninclined to disbelieve it, here is evidence enough, his own\r\nhandwriting, I assure you.” She then delivered her cousin the letter\r\nwith the proposals of marriage, which, if the reader hath a desire to\r\nsee, he will find already on record in the XVth book of this history.\r\n\r\n“Upon my word I am astonished,” said Mrs Western; “this is, indeed, a\r\nmasterpiece of assurance. With your leave I may possibly make some use\r\nof this letter.” “You have my full liberty,” cries Lady Bellaston, “to\r\napply it to what purpose you please. However, I would not have it\r\nshewn to any but Miss Western, nor to her unless you find occasion.”\r\n “Well, and how did you use the fellow?” returned Mrs Western. “Not as\r\na husband,” said the lady; “I am not married, I promise you, my dear.\r\nYou know, Bell, I have tried the comforts once already; and once, I\r\nthink, is enough for any reasonable woman.”\r\n\r\nThis letter Lady Bellaston thought would certainly turn the balance\r\nagainst Jones in the mind of Sophia, and she was emboldened to give it\r\nup, partly by her hopes of having him instantly dispatched out of the\r\nway, and partly by having secured the evidence of Honour, who, upon\r\nsounding her, she saw sufficient reason to imagine was prepared to\r\ntestify whatever she pleased.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the reader may wonder why Lady Bellaston, who in her heart\r\nhated Sophia, should be so desirous of promoting a match which was so\r\nmuch to the interest of the young lady. Now, I would desire such\r\nreaders to look carefully into human nature, page almost the last, and\r\nthere he will find, in scarce legible characters, that women,\r\nnotwithstanding the preposterous behaviour of mothers, aunts, &c., in\r\nmatrimonial matters, do in reality think it so great a misfortune to\r\nhave their inclinations in love thwarted, that they imagine they ought\r\nnever to carry enmity higher than upon these disappointments; again,\r\nhe will find it written much about the same place, that a woman who\r\nhath once been pleased with the possession of a man, will go above\r\nhalfway to the devil, to prevent any other woman from enjoying the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nIf he will not be contented with these reasons, I freely confess I see\r\nno other motive to the actions of that lady, unless we will conceive\r\nshe was bribed by Lord Fellamar, which for my own part I see no cause\r\nto suspect.\r\n\r\nNow this was the affair which Mrs Western was preparing to introduce\r\nto Sophia, by some prefatory discourse on the folly of love, and on\r\nthe wisdom of legal prostitution for hire, when her brother and Blifil\r\nbroke abruptly in upon her; and hence arose all that coldness in her\r\nbehaviour to Blifil, which, though the squire, as was usual with him,\r\nimputed to a wrong cause, infused into Blifil himself (he being a much\r\nmore cunning man) a suspicion of the real truth."

      "content": "In which Jones pays a visit to Mrs Fitzpatrick.\r\n\nThe reader may now, perhaps, be pleased to return with us to Mr Jones,\r\nwho, at the appointed hour, attended on Mrs Fitzpatrick; but before we\r\nrelate the conversation which now past it may be proper, according to\r\nour method, to return a little back, and to account for so great an\r\nalteration of behaviour in this lady, that from changing her lodging\r\nprincipally to avoid Mr Jones, she had now industriously, as hath been\r\nseen, sought this interview.\r\n\r\nAnd here we shall need only to resort to what happened the preceding\r\nday, when, hearing from Lady Bellaston that Mr Western was arrived in\r\ntown, she went to pay her duty to him, at his lodgings at Piccadilly,\r\nwhere she was received with many scurvy compellations too coarse to be\r\nrepeated, and was even threatened to be kicked out of doors. From\r\nhence, an old servant of her aunt Western, with whom she was well\r\nacquainted, conducted her to the lodgings of that lady, who treated\r\nher not more kindly, but more politely; or, to say the truth, with\r\nrudeness in another way. In short, she returned from both, plainly\r\nconvinced, not only that her scheme of reconciliation had proved\r\nabortive, but that she must for ever give over all thoughts of\r\nbringing it about by any means whatever. From this moment desire of\r\nrevenge only filled her mind; and in this temper meeting Jones at the\r\nplay, an opportunity seemed to her to occur of effecting this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe reader must remember that he was acquainted by Mrs Fitzpatrick, in\r\nthe account she gave of her own story, with the fondness Mrs Western\r\nhad formerly shewn for Mr Fitzpatrick at Bath, from the disappointment\r\nof which Mrs Fitzpatrick derived the great bitterness her aunt had\r\nexpressed toward her. She had, therefore, no doubt but that the good\r\nlady would as easily listen to the addresses of Mr Jones as she had\r\nbefore done to the other; for the superiority of charms was clearly on\r\nthe side of Mr Jones; and the advance which her aunt had since made in\r\nage, she concluded (how justly I will not say), was an argument rather\r\nin favour of her project than against it.\r\n\r\nTherefore, when Jones attended, after a previous declaration of her\r\ndesire of serving him, arising, as she said, from a firm assurance how\r\nmuch she should by so doing oblige Sophia; and after some excuses for\r\nher former disappointment, and after acquainting Mr Jones in whose\r\ncustody his mistress was, of which she thought him ignorant; she very\r\nexplicitly mentioned her scheme to him, and advised him to make sham\r\naddresses to the older lady, in order to procure an easy access to the\r\nyounger, informing him at the same time of the success which Mr\r\nFitzpatrick had formerly owed to the very same stratagem.\r\n\r\nMr Jones expressed great gratitude to the lady for the kind intentions\r\ntowards him which she had expressed, and indeed testified, by this\r\nproposal; but, besides intimating some diffidence of success from the\r\nlady's knowledge of his love to her niece, which had not been her case\r\nin regard to Mr Fitzpatrick, he said, he was afraid Miss Western would\r\nnever agree to an imposition of this kind, as well from her utter\r\ndetestation of all fallacy as from her avowed duty to her aunt.\r\n\r\nMrs Fitzpatrick was a little nettled at this; and indeed, if it may\r\nnot be called a lapse of the tongue, it was a small deviation from\r\npoliteness in Jones, and into which he scarce would have fallen, had\r\nnot the delight he felt in praising Sophia hurried him out of all\r\nreflection; for this commendation of one cousin was more than a tacit\r\nrebuke on the other.\r\n\r\n“Indeed, sir,” answered the lady, with some warmth, “I cannot think\r\nthere is anything easier than to cheat an old woman with a profession\r\nof love, when her complexion is amorous; and, though she is my aunt, I\r\nmust say there never was a more liquorish one than her ladyship. Can't\r\nyou pretend that the despair of possessing her niece, from her being\r\npromised to Blifil, has made you turn your thoughts towards her? As to\r\nmy cousin Sophia, I can't imagine her to be such a simpleton as to\r\nhave the least scruple on such an account, or to conceive any harm in\r\npunishing one of these haggs for the many mischiefs they bring upon\r\nfamilies by their tragi-comic passions; for which I think it is a pity\r\nthey are not punishable by law. I had no such scruple myself; and yet\r\nI hope my cousin Sophia will not think it an affront when I say she\r\ncannot detest every real species of falsehood more than her cousin\r\nFitzpatrick. To my aunt, indeed, I pretend no duty, nor doth she\r\ndeserve any. However, sir, I have given you my advice; and if you\r\ndecline pursuing it, I shall have the less opinion of your\r\nunderstanding--that's all.”\r\n\r\nJones now clearly saw the error he had committed, and exerted his\r\nutmost power to rectify it; but he only faultered and stuttered into\r\nnonsense and contradiction. To say the truth, it is often safer to\r\nabide by the consequences of the first blunder than to endeavour to\r\nrectify it; for by such endeavours we generally plunge deeper instead\r\nof extricating ourselves; and few persons will on such occasions have\r\nthe good-nature which Mrs Fitzpatrick displayed to Jones, by saying,\r\nwith a smile, “You need attempt no more excuses; for I can easily\r\nforgive a real lover, whatever is the effect of fondness for his\r\nmistress.”\r\n\r\nShe then renewed her proposal, and very fervently recommended it,\r\nomitting no argument which her invention could suggest on the subject;\r\nfor she was so violently incensed against her aunt, that scarce\r\nanything was capable of affording her equal pleasure with exposing\r\nher; and, like a true woman, she would see no difficulties in the\r\nexecution of a favourite scheme.\r\n\r\nJones, however, persisted in declining the undertaking, which had not,\r\nindeed, the least probability of success. He easily perceived the\r\nmotives which induced Mrs Fitzpatrick to be so eager in pressing her\r\nadvice. He said he would not deny the tender and passionate regard he\r\nhad for Sophia; but was so conscious of the inequality of their\r\nsituations, that he could never flatter himself so far as to hope that\r\nso divine a young lady would condescend to think on so unworthy a man;\r\nnay, he protested, he could scarce bring himself to wish she should.\r\nHe concluded with a profession of generous sentiments, which we have\r\nnot at present leisure to insert.\r\n\r\nThere are some fine women (for I dare not here speak in too general\r\nterms) with whom self is so predominant, that they never detach it\r\nfrom any subject; and, as vanity is with them a ruling principle, they\r\nare apt to lay hold of whatever praise they meet with; and, though the\r\nproperty of others, convey it to their own use. In the company of\r\nthese ladies it is impossible to say anything handsome of another\r\nwoman which they will not apply to themselves; nay, they often improve\r\nthe praise they seize; as, for instance, if her beauty, her wit, her\r\ngentility, her good humour deserve so much commendation, what do I\r\ndeserve, who possess those qualities in so much more eminent a degree?\r\n\r\nTo these ladies a man often recommends himself while he is commending\r\nanother woman; and, while he is expressing ardour and generous\r\nsentiments for his mistress, they are considering what a charming\r\nlover this man would make to them, who can feel all this tenderness\r\nfor an inferior degree of merit. Of this, strange as it may seem, I\r\nhave seen many instances besides Mrs Fitzpatrick, to whom all this\r\nreally happened, and who now began to feel a somewhat for Mr Jones,\r\nthe symptoms of which she much sooner understood than poor Sophia had\r\nformerly done.\r\n\r\nTo say the truth, perfect beauty in both sexes is a more irresistible\r\nobject than it is generally thought; for, notwithstanding some of us\r\nare contented with more homely lots, and learn by rote (as children to\r\nrepeat what gives them no idea) to despise outside, and to value more\r\nsolid charms; yet I have always observed, at the approach of\r\nconsummate beauty, that these more solid charms only shine with that\r\nkind of lustre which the stars have after the rising of the sun.\r\n\r\nWhen Jones had finished his exclamations, many of which would have\r\nbecome the mouth of Oroöndates himself, Mrs Fitzpatrick heaved a\r\ndeep sigh, and, taking her eyes off from Jones, on whom they had been\r\nsome time fixed, and dropping them on the ground, she cried, “Indeed,\r\nMr Jones, I pity you; but it is the curse of such tenderness to be\r\nthrown away on those who are insensible of it. I know my cousin better\r\nthan you, Mr Jones, and I must say, any woman who makes no return to\r\nsuch a passion, and such a person, is unworthy of both.”\r\n\r\n“Sure, madam,” said Jones, “you can't mean----” “Mean!” cries Mrs\r\nFitzpatrick, “I know not what I mean; there is something, I think, in\r\ntrue tenderness bewitching; few women ever meet with it in men, and\r\nfewer still know how to value it when they do. I never heard such\r\ntruly noble sentiments, and I can't tell how it is, but you force one\r\nto believe you. Sure she must be the most contemptible of women who\r\ncan overlook such merit.”\r\n\r\nThe manner and look with which all this was spoke infused a suspicion\r\ninto Jones which we don't care to convey in direct words to the\r\nreader. Instead of making any answer, he said, “I am afraid, madam, I\r\nhave made too tiresome a visit;” and offered to take his leave.\r\n\r\n“Not at all, sir,” answered Mrs Fitzpatrick.--“Indeed I pity you, Mr\r\nJones; indeed I do: but if you are going, consider of the scheme I\r\nhave mentioned--I am convinced you will approve it--and let me see you\r\nagain as soon as you can.--To-morrow morning if you will, or at least\r\nsome time to-morrow. I shall be at home all day.”\r\n\r\nJones, then, after many expressions of thanks, very respectfully\r\nretired; nor could Mrs Fitzpatrick forbear making him a present of a\r\nlook at parting, by which if he had understood nothing, he must have\r\nhad no understanding in the language of the eyes. In reality, it\r\nconfirmed his resolution of returning to her no more; for, faulty as\r\nhe hath hitherto appeared in this history, his whole thoughts were now\r\nso confined to his Sophia, that I believe no woman upon earth could\r\nhave now drawn him into an act of inconstancy.\r\n\r\nFortune, however, who was not his friend, resolved, as he intended to\r\ngive her no second opportunity, to make the best of this; and\r\naccordingly produced the tragical incident which we are now in\r\nsorrowful notes to record."

      "content": "The consequence of the preceding visit.\r\n\nMr Fitzpatrick having received the letter before mentioned from Mrs\r\nWestern, and being by that means acquainted with the place to which\r\nhis wife was retired, returned directly to Bath, and thence the day\r\nafter set forward to London.\r\n\r\nThe reader hath been already often informed of the jealous temper of\r\nthis gentleman. He may likewise be pleased to remember the suspicion\r\nwhich he had conceived of Jones at Upton, upon his finding him in the\r\nroom with Mrs Waters; and, though sufficient reasons had afterwards\r\nappeared entirely to clear up that suspicion, yet now the reading so\r\nhandsome a character of Mr Jones from his wife, caused him to reflect\r\nthat she likewise was in the inn at the same time, and jumbled\r\ntogether such a confusion of circumstances in a head which was\r\nnaturally none of the clearest, that the whole produced that\r\ngreen-eyed monster mentioned by Shakespear in his tragedy of Othello.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as he was enquiring in the street after his wife, and had\r\njust received directions to the door, unfortunately Mr Jones was\r\nissuing from it.\r\n\r\nFitzpatrick did not yet recollect the face of Jones; however, seeing a\r\nyoung well-dressed fellow coming from his wife, he made directly up to\r\nhim, and asked him what he had been doing in that house? “for I am\r\nsure,” said he, “you must have been in it, as I saw you come out of\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nJones answered very modestly, “That he had been visiting a lady\r\nthere.” To which Fitzpatrick replied, “What business have you with the\r\nlady?” Upon which Jones, who now perfectly remembered the voice,\r\nfeatures, and indeed coat, of the gentleman, cried out----“Ha, my good\r\nfriend! give me your hand; I hope there is no ill blood remaining\r\nbetween us, upon a small mistake which happened so long ago.”\r\n\r\n“Upon my soul, sir,” said Fitzpatrick, “I don't know your name nor\r\nyour face.” “Indeed, sir,” said Jones, “neither have I the pleasure of\r\nknowing your name, but your face I very well remember to have seen\r\nbefore at Upton, where a foolish quarrel happened between us, which,\r\nif it is not made up yet, we will now make up over a bottle.”\r\n\r\n“At Upton!” cried the other;----“Ha! upon my soul, I believe your name\r\nis Jones?” “Indeed,” answered he, “it is.”--“O! upon my soul,” cries\r\nFitzpatrick, “you are the very man I wanted to meet.--Upon my soul I\r\nwill drink a bottle with you presently; but first I will give you a\r\ngreat knock over the pate. There is for you, you rascal. Upon my soul,\r\nif you do not give me satisfaction for that blow, I will give you\r\nanother.” And then, drawing his sword, put himself in a posture of\r\ndefence, which was the only science he understood.\r\n\r\nJones was a little staggered by the blow, which came somewhat\r\nunexpectedly; but presently recovering himself he also drew, and\r\nthough he understood nothing of fencing, prest on so boldly upon\r\nFitzpatrick, that he beat down his guard, and sheathed one half of his\r\nsword in the body of the said gentleman, who had no sooner received it\r\nthan he stept backwards, dropped the point of his sword, and leaning\r\nupon it, cried, “I have satisfaction enough: I am a dead man.”\r\n\r\n“I hope not,” cries Jones, “but whatever be the consequence, you must\r\nbe sensible you have drawn it upon yourself.” At this instant a number\r\nof fellows rushed in and seized Jones, who told them he should make no\r\nresistance, and begged some of them at least would take care of the\r\nwounded gentleman.\r\n\r\n“Ay,” cries one of the fellows, “the wounded gentleman will be taken\r\ncare enough of; for I suppose he hath not many hours to live. As for\r\nyou, sir, you have a month at least good yet.” “D--n me, Jack,” said\r\nanother, “he hath prevented his voyage; he's bound to another port\r\nnow;” and many other such jests was our poor Jones made the subject of\r\nby these fellows, who were indeed the gang employed by Lord Fellamar,\r\nand had dogged him into the house of Mrs Fitzpatrick, waiting for him\r\nat the corner of the street when this unfortunate accident happened.\r\n\r\nThe officer who commanded this gang very wisely concluded that his\r\nbusiness was now to deliver his prisoner into the hands of the civil\r\nmagistrate. He ordered him, therefore, to be carried to a\r\npublic-house, where, having sent for a constable, he delivered him to\r\nhis custody.\r\n\r\nThe constable, seeing Mr Jones very well drest, and hearing that the\r\naccident had happened in a duel, treated his prisoner with great\r\ncivility, and at his request dispatched a messenger to enquire after\r\nthe wounded gentleman, who was now at a tavern under the surgeon's\r\nhands. The report brought back was, that the wound was certainly\r\nmortal, and there were no hopes of life. Upon which the constable\r\ninformed Jones that he must go before a justice. He answered,\r\n“Wherever you please; I am indifferent as to what happens to me; for\r\nthough I am convinced I am not guilty of murder in the eye of the law,\r\nyet the weight of blood I find intolerable upon my mind.”\r\n\r\nJones was now conducted before the justice, where the surgeon who\r\ndressed Mr Fitzpatrick appeared, and deposed that he believed the\r\nwound to be mortal; upon which the prisoner was committed to the\r\nGatehouse. It was very late at night, so that Jones would not send for\r\nPartridge till the next morning; and, as he never shut his eyes till\r\nseven, so it was near twelve before the poor fellow, who was greatly\r\nfrightened at not hearing from his master so long, received a message\r\nwhich almost deprived him of his being when he heard it.\r\n\r\nHe went to the Gatehouse with trembling knees and a beating heart, and\r\nwas no sooner arrived in the presence of Jones than he lamented the\r\nmisfortune that had befallen him with many tears, looking all the\r\nwhile frequently about him in great terror; for as the news now\r\narrived that Mr Fitzpatrick was dead, the poor fellow apprehended\r\nevery minute that his ghost would enter the room. At last he delivered\r\nhim a letter, which he had like to have forgot, and which came from\r\nSophia by the hands of Black George.\r\n\r\nJones presently dispatched every one out of the room, and, having\r\neagerly broke open the letter, read as follows:--\r\n\r\n “You owe the hearing from me again to an accident which I own\r\n surprizes me. My aunt hath just now shown me a letter from you to\r\n Lady Bellaston, which contains a proposal of marriage. I am\r\n convinced it is your own hand; and what more surprizes me is, that\r\n it is dated at the very time when you would have me imagine you was\r\n under such concern on my account.--I leave you to comment on this\r\n fact. All I desire is, that your name may never more be mentioned\r\n to\r\n\r\n “S. W.”\r\n\r\nOf the present situation of Mr Jones's mind, and of the pangs with\r\nwhich he was now tormented, we cannot give the reader a better idea\r\nthan by saying, his misery was such that even Thwackum would almost\r\nhave pitied him. But, bad as it is, we shall at present leave him in\r\nit, as his good genius (if he really had any) seems to have done. And\r\nhere we put an end to the sixteenth book of our history.\r\n\nBOOK XVII.\r\n\r\nCONTAINING THREE DAYS."

      "content": "Containing a portion of introductory writing.\r\n\nWhen a comic writer hath made his principal characters as happy as he\r\ncan, or when a tragic writer hath brought them to the highest pitch of\r\nhuman misery, they both conclude their business to be done, and that\r\ntheir work is come to a period.\r\n\r\nHad we been of the tragic complexion, the reader must now allow we\r\nwere very nearly arrived at this period, since it would be difficult\r\nfor the devil, or any of his representatives on earth, to have\r\ncontrived much greater torments for poor Jones than those in which we\r\nleft him in the last chapter; and as for Sophia, a good-natured woman\r\nwould hardly wish more uneasiness to a rival than what she must at\r\npresent be supposed to feel. What then remains to complete the tragedy\r\nbut a murder or two and a few moral sentences!\r\n\r\nBut to bring our favourites out of their present anguish and distress,\r\nand to land them at last on the shore of happiness, seems a much\r\nharder task; a task indeed so hard that we do not undertake to execute\r\nit. In regard to Sophia, it is more than probable that we shall\r\nsomewhere or other provide a good husband for her in the end--either\r\nBlifil, or my lord, or somebody else; but as to poor Jones, such are\r\nthe calamities in which he is at present involved, owing to his\r\nimprudence, by which if a man doth not become felon to the world, he\r\nis at least a _felo de se_; so destitute is he now of friends, and so\r\npersecuted by enemies, that we almost despair of bringing him to any\r\ngood; and if our reader delights in seeing executions, I think he\r\nought not to lose any time in taking a first row at Tyburn.\r\n\r\nThis I faithfully promise, that, notwithstanding any affection which\r\nwe may be supposed to have for this rogue, whom we have unfortunately\r\nmade our heroe, we will lend him none of that supernatural assistance\r\nwith which we are entrusted, upon condition that we use it only on\r\nvery important occasions. If he doth not therefore find some natural\r\nmeans of fairly extricating himself from all his distresses, we will\r\ndo no violence to the truth and dignity of history for his sake; for\r\nwe had rather relate that he was hanged at Tyburn (which may very\r\nprobably be the case) than forfeit our integrity, or shock the faith\r\nof our reader.\r\n\r\nIn this the antients had a great advantage over the moderns. Their\r\nmythology, which was at that time more firmly believed by the vulgar\r\nthan any religion is at present, gave them always an opportunity of\r\ndelivering a favourite heroe. Their deities were always ready at the\r\nwriter's elbow, to execute any of his purposes; and the more\r\nextraordinary the invention was, the greater was the surprize and\r\ndelight of the credulous reader. Those writers could with greater ease\r\nhave conveyed a heroe from one country to another, nay from one world\r\nto another, and have brought him back again, than a poor circumscribed\r\nmodern can deliver him from a jail.\r\n\r\nThe Arabians and Persians had an equal advantage in writing their\r\ntales from the genii and fairies, which they believe in as an article\r\nof their faith, upon the authority of the Koran itself. But we have\r\nnone of these helps. To natural means alone we are confined; let us\r\ntry therefore what, by these means, may be done for poor Jones; though\r\nto confess the truth, something whispers me in the ear that he doth\r\nnot yet know the worst of his fortune; and that a more shocking piece\r\nof news than any he hath yet heard remains for him in the unopened\r\nleaves of fate."

      "content": "The generous and grateful behaviour of Mrs Miller.\r\n\nMr Allworthy and Mrs Miller were just sat down to breakfast, when\r\nBlifil, who had gone out very early that morning, returned to make one\r\nof the company.\r\n\r\nHe had not been long seated before he began as follows: “Good Lord! my\r\ndear uncle, what do you think hath happened? I vow I am afraid of\r\ntelling it you, for fear of shocking you with the remembrance of ever\r\nhaving shewn any kindness to such a villain.” “What is the matter,\r\nchild?” said the uncle. “I fear I have shewn kindness in my life to\r\nthe unworthy more than once. But charity doth not adopt the vices of\r\nits objects.” “O, sir!” returned Blifil, “it is not without the secret\r\ndirection of Providence that you mention the word adoption. Your\r\nadopted son, sir, that Jones, that wretch whom you nourished in your\r\nbosom, hath proved one of the greatest villains upon earth.” “By all\r\nthat's sacred 'tis false,” cries Mrs Miller. “Mr Jones is no villain.\r\nHe is one of the worthiest creatures breathing; and if any other\r\nperson had called him villain, I would have thrown all this boiling\r\nwater in his face.” Mr Allworthy looked very much amazed at this\r\nbehaviour. But she did not give him leave to speak, before, turning to\r\nhim, she cried, “I hope you will not be angry with me; I would not\r\noffend you, sir, for the world; but, indeed, I could not bear to hear\r\nhim called so.” “I must own, madam,” said Allworthy, very gravely, “I\r\nam a little surprized to hear you so warmly defend a fellow you do not\r\nknow.” “O! I do know him, Mr Allworthy,” said she, “indeed I do; I\r\nshould be the most ungrateful of all wretches if I denied it. O! he\r\nhath preserved me and my little family; we have all reason to bless\r\nhim while we live.--And I pray Heaven to bless him, and turn the\r\nhearts of his malicious enemies. I know, I find, I see, he hath such.”\r\n “You surprize me, madam, still more,” said Allworthy; “sure you must\r\nmean some other. It is impossible you should have any such obligations\r\nto the man my nephew mentions.” “Too surely,” answered she, “I have\r\nobligations to him of the greatest and tenderest kind. He hath been\r\nthe preserver of me and mine. Believe me, sir, he hath been abused,\r\ngrossly abused to you; I know he hath, or you, whom I know to be all\r\ngoodness and honour, would not, after the many kind and tender things\r\nI have heard you say of this poor helpless child, have so disdainfully\r\ncalled him fellow.--Indeed, my best of friends, he deserves a kinder\r\nappellation from you, had you heard the good, the kind, the grateful\r\nthings which I have heard him utter of you. He never mentions your\r\nname but with a sort of adoration. In this very room I have seen him\r\non his knees, imploring all the blessings of heaven upon your head. I\r\ndo not love that child there better than he loves you.”\r\n\r\n“I see, sir, now,” said Blifil, with one of those grinning sneers with\r\nwhich the devil marks his best beloved, “Mrs Miller really doth know\r\nhim. I suppose you will find she is not the only one of your\r\nacquaintance to whom he hath exposed you. As for my character, I\r\nperceive, by some hints she hath thrown out, he hath been very free\r\nwith it, but I forgive him.” “And the Lord forgive you, sir!” said Mrs\r\nMiller; “we have all sins enough to stand in need of his forgiveness.”\r\n\r\n“Upon my word, Mrs Miller,” said Allworthy, “I do not take this\r\nbehaviour of yours to my nephew kindly; and I do assure you, as any\r\nreflections which you cast upon him must come only from that wickedest\r\nof men, they would only serve, if that were possible, to heighten my\r\nresentment against him: for I must tell you, Mrs Miller, the young man\r\nwho now stands before you hath ever been the warmest advocate for the\r\nungrateful wretch whose cause you espouse. This, I think, when you\r\nhear it from my own mouth, will make you wonder at so much baseness\r\nand ingratitude.”\r\n\r\n“You are deceived, sir,” answered Mrs Miller; “if they were the last\r\nwords which were to issue from my lips, I would say you were deceived;\r\nand I once more repeat it, the Lord forgive those who have deceived\r\nyou! I do not pretend to say the young man is without faults; but they\r\nare all the faults of wildness and of youth; faults which he may, nay,\r\nwhich I am certain he will, relinquish, and, if he should not, they\r\nare vastly overbalanced by one of the most humane, tender, honest\r\nhearts that ever man was blest with.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, Mrs Miller,” said Allworthy, “had this been related of you, I\r\nshould not have believed it.” “Indeed, sir,” answered she, “you will\r\nbelieve everything I have said, I am sure you will: and when you have\r\nheard the story which I shall tell you (for I will tell you all), you\r\nwill be so far from being offended, that you will own (I know your\r\njustice so well), that I must have been the most despicable and most\r\nungrateful of wretches if I had acted any other part than I have.”\r\n\r\n“Well, madam,” said Allworthy, “I shall be very glad to hear any good\r\nexcuse for a behaviour which, I must confess, I think wants an excuse.\r\nAnd now, madam, will you be pleased to let my nephew proceed in his\r\nstory without interruption. He would not have introduced a matter of\r\nslight consequence with such a preface. Perhaps even this story will\r\ncure you of your mistake.”\r\n\r\nMrs Miller gave tokens of submission, and then Mr Blifil began thus:\r\n“I am sure, sir, if you don't think proper to resent the ill-usage of\r\nMrs Miller, I shall easily forgive what affects me only. I think your\r\ngoodness hath not deserved this indignity at her hands.” “Well,\r\nchild,” said Allworthy, “but what is this new instance? What hath he\r\ndone of late?” “What,” cries Blifil, “notwithstanding all Mrs Miller\r\nhath said, I am very sorry to relate, and what you should never have\r\nheard from me, had it not been a matter impossible to conceal from the\r\nwhole world. In short he hath killed a man; I will not say\r\nmurdered--for perhaps it may not be so construed in law, and I hope\r\nthe best for his sake.”\r\n\r\nAllworthy looked shocked, and blessed himself; and then, turning to\r\nMrs Miller, he cried, “Well, madam, what say you now?”\r\n\r\n“Why, I say, sir,” answered she, “that I never was more concerned at\r\nanything in my life; but, if the fact be true, I am convinced the man,\r\nwhoever he is, was in fault. Heaven knows there are many villains in\r\nthis town who make it their business to provoke young gentlemen.\r\nNothing but the greatest provocation could have tempted him; for of\r\nall the gentlemen I ever had in my house, I never saw one so gentle or\r\nso sweet-tempered. He was beloved by every one in the house, and every\r\none who came near it.”\r\n\r\nWhile she was thus running on, a violent knocking at the door\r\ninterrupted their conversation, and prevented her from proceeding\r\nfurther, or from receiving any answer; for, as she concluded this was\r\na visitor to Mr Allworthy, she hastily retired, taking with her her\r\nlittle girl, whose eyes were all over blubbered at the melancholy news\r\nshe heard of Jones, who used to call her his little wife, and not only\r\ngave her many playthings, but spent whole hours in playing with her\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nSome readers may, perhaps, be pleased with these minute circumstances,\r\nin relating of which we follow the example of Plutarch, one of the\r\nbest of our brother historians; and others, to whom they may appear\r\ntrivial, will, we hope, at least pardon them, as we are never prolix\r\non such occasions."

      "content": "The arrival of Mr Western, with some matters concerning the paternal\r\nauthority.\r\n\nMrs Miller had not long left the room when Mr Western entered; but not\r\nbefore a small wrangling bout had passed between him and his chairmen;\r\nfor the fellows, who had taken up their burden at the Hercules\r\nPillars, had conceived no hopes of having any future good customer in\r\nthe squire; and they were moreover farther encouraged by his\r\ngenerosity (for he had given them of his own accord sixpence more than\r\ntheir fare); they therefore very boldly demanded another shilling,\r\nwhich so provoked the squire, that he not only bestowed many hearty\r\ncurses on them at the door, but retained his anger after he came into\r\nthe room; swearing that all the Londoners were like the court, and\r\nthought of nothing but plundering country gentlemen. “D--n me,” says\r\nhe, “if I won't walk in the rain rather than get into one of their\r\nhand-barrows again. They have jolted me more in a mile than Brown Bess\r\nwould in a long fox-chase.”\r\n\r\nWhen his wrath on this occasion was a little appeased, he resumed the\r\nsame passionate tone on another. “There,” says he, “there is fine\r\nbusiness forwards now. The hounds have changed at last; and when we\r\nimagined we had a fox to deal with, od-rat it, it turns out to be a\r\nbadger at last!”\r\n\r\n“Pray, my good neighbour,” said Allworthy, “drop your metaphors, and\r\nspeak a little plainer.” “Why, then,” says the squire, “to tell you\r\nplainly, we have been all this time afraid of a son of a whore of a\r\nbastard of somebody's, I don't know whose, not I. And now here's a\r\nconfounded son of a whore of a lord, who may be a bastard too for what\r\nI know or care, for he shall never have a daughter of mine by my\r\nconsent. They have beggared the nation, but they shall never beggar\r\nme. My land shall never be sent over to Hanover.”\r\n\r\n“You surprize me much, my good friend,” said Allworthy. “Why, zounds!\r\nI am surprized myself,” answered the squire. “I went to zee sister\r\nWestern last night, according to her own appointment, and there I was\r\nhad into a whole room full of women. There was my lady cousin\r\nBellaston, and my Lady Betty, and my Lady Catherine, and my lady I\r\ndon't know who; d--n me, if ever you catch me among such a kennel of\r\nhoop-petticoat b--s! D--n me, I'd rather be run by my own dogs, as one\r\nActon was, that the story-book says was turned into a hare, and his\r\nown dogs killed un and eat un. Od-rabbit it, no mortal was ever run in\r\nsuch a manner; if I dodged one way, one had me; if I offered to clap\r\nback, another snapped me. `O! certainly one of the greatest matches in\r\nEngland,' says one cousin (here he attempted to mimic them); `A very\r\nadvantageous offer indeed,' cries another cousin (for you must know\r\nthey be all my cousins, thof I never zeed half o' um before).\r\n`Surely,' says that fat a--se b--, my Lady Bellaston, `cousin, you\r\nmust be out of your wits to think of refusing such an offer.'”\r\n\r\n“Now I begin to understand,” says Allworthy; “some person hath made\r\nproposals to Miss Western, which the ladies of the family approve, but\r\nis not to your liking.”\r\n\r\n“My liking!” said Western, “how the devil should it? I tell you it is\r\na lord, and those are always volks whom you know I always resolved to\r\nhave nothing to do with. Did unt I refuse a matter of vorty years'\r\npurchase now for a bit of land, which one o' um had a mind to put into\r\na park, only because I would have no dealings with lords, and dost\r\nthink I would marry my daughter zu? Besides, ben't I engaged to you,\r\nand did I ever go off any bargain when I had promised?”\r\n\r\n“As to that point, neighbour,” said Allworthy, “I entirely release you\r\nfrom any engagement. No contract can be binding between parties who\r\nhave not a full power to make it at the time, nor ever afterwards\r\nacquire the power of fulfilling it.”\r\n\r\n“Slud! then,” answered Western, “I tell you I have power, and I will\r\nfulfil it. Come along with me directly to Doctors' Commons, I will get\r\na licence; and I will go to sister and take away the wench by force,\r\nand she shall ha un, or I will lock her up, and keep her upon bread\r\nand water as long as she lives.”\r\n\r\n“Mr Western,” said Allworthy, “shall I beg you will hear my full\r\nsentiments on this matter?”--“Hear thee; ay, to be sure I will,”\r\n answered he. “Why, then, sir,” cries Allworthy, “I can truly say,\r\nwithout a compliment either to you or the young lady, that when this\r\nmatch was proposed, I embraced it very readily and heartily, from my\r\nregard to you both. An alliance between two families so nearly\r\nneighbours, and between whom there had always existed so mutual an\r\nintercourse and good harmony, I thought a most desirable event; and\r\nwith regard to the young lady, not only the concurrent opinion of all\r\nwho knew her, but my own observation assured me that she would be an\r\ninestimable treasure to a good husband. I shall say nothing of her\r\npersonal qualifications, which certainly are admirable; her good\r\nnature, her charitable disposition, her modesty, are too well known to\r\nneed any panegyric: but she hath one quality which existed in a high\r\ndegree in that best of women, who is now one of the first of angels,\r\nwhich, as it is not of a glaring kind, more commonly escapes\r\nobservation; so little indeed is it remarked, that I want a word to\r\nexpress it. I must use negatives on this occasion. I never heard\r\nanything of pertness, or what is called repartee, out of her mouth; no\r\npretence to wit, much less to that kind of wisdom which is the result\r\nonly of great learning and experience, the affectation of which, in a\r\nyoung woman, is as absurd as any of the affectations of an ape. No\r\ndictatorial sentiments, no judicial opinions, no profound criticisms.\r\nWhenever I have seen her in the company of men, she hath been all\r\nattention, with the modesty of a learner, not the forwardness of a\r\nteacher. You'll pardon me for it, but I once, to try her only, desired\r\nher opinion on a point which was controverted between Mr Thwackum and\r\nMr Square. To which she answered, with much sweetness, `You will\r\npardon me, good Mr Allworthy; I am sure you cannot in earnest think me\r\ncapable of deciding any point in which two such gentlemen disagree.'\r\nThwackum and Square, who both alike thought themselves sure of a\r\nfavourable decision, seconded my request. She answered with the same\r\ngood humour, `I must absolutely be excused: for I will affront neither\r\nso much as to give my judgment on his side.' Indeed, she always shewed\r\nthe highest deference to the understandings of men; a quality\r\nabsolutely essential to the making a good wife. I shall only add, that\r\nas she is most apparently void of all affectation, this deference must\r\nbe certainly real.”\r\n\r\nHere Blifil sighed bitterly; upon which Western, whose eyes were full\r\nof tears at the praise of Sophia, blubbered out, “Don't be\r\nchicken-hearted, for shat ha her, d--n me, shat ha her, if she was\r\ntwenty times as good.”\r\n\r\n“Remember your promise, sir,” cried Allworthy, “I was not to be\r\ninterrupted.” “Well, shat unt,” answered the squire; “I won't speak\r\nanother word.”\r\n\r\n“Now, my good friend,” continued Allworthy, “I have dwelt so long on\r\nthe merit of this young lady, partly as I really am in love with her\r\ncharacter, and partly that fortune (for the match in that light is\r\nreally advantageous on my nephew's side) might not be imagined to be\r\nmy principal view in having so eagerly embraced the proposal. Indeed,\r\nI heartily wished to receive so great a jewel into my family; but\r\nthough I may wish for many good things, I would not, therefore, steal\r\nthem, or be guilty of any violence or injustice to possess myself of\r\nthem. Now to force a woman into a marriage contrary to her consent or\r\napprobation, is an act of such injustice and oppression, that I wish\r\nthe laws of our country could restrain it; but a good conscience is\r\nnever lawless in the worst regulated state, and will provide those\r\nlaws for itself, which the neglect of legislators hath forgotten to\r\nsupply. This is surely a case of that kind; for, is it not cruel, nay,\r\nimpious, to force a woman into that state against her will; for her\r\nbehaviour in which she is to be accountable to the highest and most\r\ndreadful court of judicature, and to answer at the peril of her soul?\r\nTo discharge the matrimonial duties in an adequate manner is no easy\r\ntask; and shall we lay this burthen upon a woman, while we at the same\r\ntime deprive her of all that assistance which may enable her to\r\nundergo it? Shall we tear her very heart from her, while we enjoin her\r\nduties to which a whole heart is scarce equal? I must speak very\r\nplainly here. I think parents who act in this manner are accessories\r\nto all the guilt which their children afterwards incur, and of course\r\nmust, before a just judge, expect to partake of their punishment; but\r\nif they could avoid this, good heaven! is there a soul who can bear\r\nthe thought of having contributed to the damnation of his child?\r\n\r\n“For these reasons, my best neighbour, as I see the inclinations of\r\nthis young lady are most unhappily averse to my nephew, I must decline\r\nany further thoughts of the honour you intended him, though I assure\r\nyou I shall always retain the most grateful sense of it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” said Western (the froth bursting forth from his lips the\r\nmoment they were uncorked), “you cannot say but I have heard you out,\r\nand now I expect you'll hear me; and if I don't answer every word\r\non't, why then I'll consent to gee the matter up. First then, I\r\ndesire you to answer me one question--Did not I beget her? did not I\r\nbeget her? answer me that. They say, indeed, it is a wise father that\r\nknows his own child; but I am sure I have the best title to her, for\r\nI bred her up. But I believe you will allow me to be her father, and\r\nif I be, am I not to govern my own child? I ask you that, am I not to\r\ngovern my own child? and if I am to govern her in other matters,\r\nsurely I am to govern her in this, which concerns her most. And what\r\nam I desiring all this while? Am I desiring her to do anything for\r\nme? to give me anything?--Zu much on t'other side, that I am only\r\ndesiring her to take away half my estate now, and t'other half when I\r\ndie. Well, and what is it all vor? Why, is unt it to make her happy?\r\nIt's enough to make one mad to hear volks talk; if I was going to\r\nmarry myself, then she would ha reason to cry and to blubber; but, on\r\nthe contrary, han't I offered to bind down my land in such a manner,\r\nthat I could not marry if I would, seeing as narro' woman upon earth\r\nwould ha me. What the devil in hell can I do more? I contribute to\r\nher damnation!--Zounds! I'd zee all the world d--n'd bevore her\r\nlittle vinger should be hurt. Indeed, Mr Allworthy, you must excuse\r\nme, but I am surprized to hear you talk in zuch a manner, and I must\r\nsay, take it how you will, that I thought you had more sense.”\r\n\r\nAllworthy resented this reflection only with a smile; nor could he, if\r\nhe would have endeavoured it, have conveyed into that smile any\r\nmixture of malice or contempt. His smiles at folly were indeed such as\r\nwe may suppose the angels bestow on the absurdities of mankind.\r\n\r\nBlifil now desired to be permitted to speak a few words. “As to using\r\nany violence on the young lady, I am sure I shall never consent to it.\r\nMy conscience will not permit me to use violence on any one, much less\r\non a lady for whom, however cruel she is to me, I shall always\r\npreserve the purest and sincerest affection; but yet I have read that\r\nwomen are seldom proof against perseverance. Why may I not hope then\r\nby such perseverance at last to gain those inclinations, in which for\r\nthe future I shall, perhaps, have no rival; for as for this lord, Mr\r\nWestern is so kind to prefer me to him; and sure, sir, you will not\r\ndeny but that a parent hath at least a negative voice in these\r\nmatters; nay, I have heard this very young lady herself say so more\r\nthan once, and declare that she thought children inexcusable who\r\nmarried in direct opposition to the will of their parents. Besides,\r\nthough the other ladies of the family seem to favour the pretensions\r\nof my lord, I do not find the lady herself is inclined to give him any\r\ncountenance; alas! I am too well assured she is not; I am too sensible\r\nthat wickedest of men remains uppermost in her heart.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, ay, so he does,” cries Western.\r\n\r\n“But surely,” says Blifil, “when she hears of this murder which he\r\nhath committed, if the law should spare his life----”\r\n\r\n“What's that?” cries Western. “Murder! hath he committed a murder, and\r\nis there any hopes of seeing him hanged?--Tol de rol, tol lol de rol.”\r\n Here he fell a singing and capering about the room.\r\n\r\n“Child,” says Allworthy, “this unhappy passion of yours distresses me\r\nbeyond measure. I heartily pity you, and would do every fair thing to\r\npromote your success.”\r\n\r\n“I desire no more,” cries Blifil; “I am convinced my dear uncle hath a\r\nbetter opinion of me than to think that I myself would accept of\r\nmore.”\r\n\r\n“Lookee,” says Allworthy, “you have my leave to write, to visit, if\r\nshe will permit it--but I insist on no thoughts of violence. I will\r\nhave no confinement, nothing of that kind attempted.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” cries the squire, “nothing of that kind shall be\r\nattempted; we will try a little longer what fair means will effect;\r\nand if this fellow be but hanged out of the way--Tol lol de rol! I\r\nnever heard better news in my life--I warrant everything goes to my\r\nmind.--Do, prithee, dear Allworthy, come and dine with me at the\r\nHercules Pillars: I have bespoke a shoulder of mutton roasted, and a\r\nspare-rib of pork, and a fowl and egg-sauce. There will be nobody but\r\nourselves, unless we have a mind to have the landlord; for I have sent\r\nParson Supple down to Basingstoke after my tobacco-box, which I left\r\nat an inn there, and I would not lose it for the world; for it is an\r\nold acquaintance of above twenty years' standing. I can tell you\r\nlandlord is a vast comical bitch, you will like un hugely.”\r\n\r\nMr Allworthy at last agreed to this invitation, and soon after the\r\nsquire went off, singing and capering at the hopes of seeing the\r\nspeedy tragical end of poor Jones.\r\n\r\nWhen he was gone, Mr Allworthy resumed the aforesaid subject with much\r\ngravity. He told his nephew, “He wished with all his heart he would\r\nendeavour to conquer a passion, in which I cannot,” says he, “flatter\r\nyou with any hopes of succeeding. It is certainly a vulgar error, that\r\naversion in a woman may be conquered by perseverance. Indifference\r\nmay, perhaps, sometimes yield to it; but the usual triumphs gained by\r\nperseverance in a lover are over caprice, prudence, affectation, and\r\noften an exorbitant degree of levity, which excites women not\r\nover-warm in their constitutions to indulge their vanity by prolonging\r\nthe time of courtship, even when they are well enough pleased with the\r\nobject, and resolve (if they ever resolve at all) to make him a very\r\npitiful amends in the end. But a fixed dislike, as I am afraid this\r\nis, will rather gather strength than be conquered by time. Besides, my\r\ndear, I have another apprehension which you must excuse. I am afraid\r\nthis passion which you have for this fine young creature hath her\r\nbeautiful person too much for its object, and is unworthy of the name\r\nof that love which is the only foundation of matrimonial felicity. To\r\nadmire, to like, and to long for the possession of a beautiful woman,\r\nwithout any regard to her sentiments towards us, is, I am afraid, too\r\nnatural; but love, I believe, is the child of love only; at least, I\r\nam pretty confident that to love the creature who we are assured hates\r\nus is not in human nature. Examine your heart, therefore, thoroughly,\r\nmy good boy, and if, upon examination, you have but the least\r\nsuspicion of this kind, I am sure your own virtue and religion will\r\nimpel you to drive so vicious a passion from your heart, and your good\r\nsense will soon enable you to do it without pain.”\r\n\r\nThe reader may pretty well guess Blifil's answer; but, if he should be\r\nat a loss, we are not at present at leisure to satisfy him, as our\r\nhistory now hastens on to matters of higher importance, and we can no\r\nlonger bear to be absent from Sophia."

      "content": "An extraordinary scene between Sophia and her aunt.\r\n\nThe lowing heifer and the bleating ewe, in herds and flocks, may\r\nramble safe and unregarded through the pastures. These are, indeed,\r\nhereafter doomed to be the prey of man; yet many years are they\r\nsuffered to enjoy their liberty undisturbed. But if a plump doe be\r\ndiscovered to have escaped from the forest, and to repose herself in\r\nsome field or grove, the whole parish is presently alarmed, every man\r\nis ready to set his dogs after her; and, if she is preserved from the\r\nrest by the good squire, it is only that he may secure her for his own\r\neating.\r\n\r\nI have often considered a very fine young woman of fortune and\r\nfashion, when first found strayed from the pale of her nursery, to be\r\nin pretty much the same situation with this doe. The town is\r\nimmediately in an uproar; she is hunted from park to play, from court\r\nto assembly, from assembly to her own chamber, and rarely escapes a\r\nsingle season from the jaws of some devourer or other; for, if her\r\nfriends protect her from some, it is only to deliver her over to one\r\nof their own chusing, often more disagreeable to her than any of the\r\nrest; while whole herds or flocks of other women securely, and scarce\r\nregarded, traverse the park, the play, the opera, and the assembly;\r\nand though, for the most part at least, they are at last devoured, yet\r\nfor a long time do they wanton in liberty, without disturbance or\r\ncontroul.\r\n\r\nOf all these paragons none ever tasted more of this persecution than\r\npoor Sophia. Her ill stars were not contented with all that she had\r\nsuffered on account of Blifil, they now raised her another pursuer,\r\nwho seemed likely to torment her no less than the other had done. For\r\nthough her aunt was less violent, she was no less assiduous in teizing\r\nher, than her father had been before.\r\n\r\nThe servants were no sooner departed after dinner than Mrs Western,\r\nwho had opened the matter to Sophia, informed her, “That she expected\r\nhis lordship that very afternoon, and intended to take the first\r\nopportunity of leaving her alone with him.” “If you do, madam,”\r\n answered Sophia, with some spirit, “I shall take the first opportunity\r\nof leaving him by himself.” “How! madam!” cries the aunt; “is this the\r\nreturn you make me for my kindness in relieving you from your\r\nconfinement at your father's?” “You know, madam,” said Sophia, “the\r\ncause of that confinement was a refusal to comply with my father in\r\naccepting a man I detested; and will my dear aunt, who hath relieved\r\nme from that distress, involve me in another equally bad?” “And do you\r\nthink then, madam,” answered Mrs Western, “that there is no difference\r\nbetween my Lord Fellamar and Mr Blifil?” “Very little, in my opinion,”\r\n cries Sophia; “and, if I must be condemned to one, I would certainly\r\nhave the merit of sacrificing myself to my father's pleasure.” “Then\r\nmy pleasure, I find,” said the aunt, “hath very little weight with\r\nyou; but that consideration shall not move me. I act from nobler\r\nmotives. The view of aggrandizing my family, of ennobling yourself, is\r\nwhat I proceed upon. Have you no sense of ambition? Are there no\r\ncharms in the thoughts of having a coronet on your coach?” “None, upon\r\nmy honour,” said Sophia. “A pincushion upon my coach would please me\r\njust as well.” “Never mention honour,” cries the aunt. “It becomes not\r\nthe mouth of such a wretch. I am sorry, niece, you force me to use\r\nthese words, but I cannot bear your groveling temper; you have none of\r\nthe blood of the Westerns in you. But, however mean and base your own\r\nideas are, you shall bring no imputation on mine. I will never suffer\r\nthe world to say of me that I encouraged you in refusing one of the\r\nbest matches in England; a match which, besides its advantage in\r\nfortune, would do honour to almost any family, and hath, indeed, in\r\ntitle, the advantage of ours.” “Surely,” says Sophia, “I am born\r\ndeficient, and have not the senses with which other people are\r\nblessed; there must be certainly some sense which can relish the\r\ndelights of sound and show, which I have not; for surely mankind would\r\nnot labour so much, nor sacrifice so much for the obtaining, nor would\r\nthey be so elate and proud with possessing, what appeared to them, as\r\nit doth to me, the most insignificant of all trifles.”\r\n\r\n“No, no, miss,” cries the aunt; “you are born with as many senses as\r\nother people; but I assure you you are not born with a sufficient\r\nunderstanding to make a fool of me, or to expose my conduct to the\r\nworld; so I declare this to you, upon my word, and you know, I\r\nbelieve, how fixed my resolutions are, unless you agree to see his\r\nlordship this afternoon, I will, with my own hands, deliver you\r\nto-morrow morning to my brother, and will never henceforth interfere\r\nwith you, nor see your face again.” Sophia stood a few moments silent\r\nafter this speech, which was uttered in a most angry and peremptory\r\ntone; and then, bursting into tears, she cryed, “Do with me, madam,\r\nwhatever you please; I am the most miserable undone wretch upon earth;\r\nif my dear aunt forsakes me where shall I look for a protector?” “My\r\ndear niece,” cries she, “you will have a very good protector in his\r\nlordship; a protector whom nothing but a hankering after that vile\r\nfellow Jones can make you decline.” “Indeed, madam,” said Sophia, “you\r\nwrong me. How can you imagine, after what you have shewn me, if I had\r\never any such thoughts, that I should not banish them for ever? If it\r\nwill satisfy you, I will receive the sacrament upon it never to see\r\nhis face again.” “But, child, dear child,” said the aunt, “be\r\nreasonable; can you invent a single objection?” “I have already, I\r\nthink, told you a sufficient objection,” answered Sophia. “What?”\r\n cries the aunt; “I remember none.” “Sure, madam,” said Sophia, “I told\r\nyou he had used me in the rudest and vilest manner.” “Indeed, child,”\r\n answered she, “I never heard you, or did not understand you:--but what\r\ndo you mean by this rude, vile manner?” “Indeed, madam,” said Sophia,\r\n“I am almost ashamed to tell you. He caught me in his arms, pulled me\r\ndown upon the settee, and thrust his hand into my bosom, and kissed it\r\nwith such violence that I have the mark upon my left breast at this\r\nmoment.” “Indeed!” said Mrs Western. “Yes, indeed, madam,” answered\r\nSophia; “my father luckily came in at that instant, or Heaven knows\r\nwhat rudeness he intended to have proceeded to.” “I am astonished and\r\nconfounded,” cries the aunt. “No woman of the name of Western hath\r\nbeen ever treated so since we were a family. I would have torn the\r\neyes of a prince out, if he had attempted such freedoms with me. It is\r\nimpossible! sure, Sophia, you must invent this to raise my indignation\r\nagainst him.” “I hope, madam,” said Sophia, “you have too good an\r\nopinion of me to imagine me capable of telling an untruth. Upon my\r\nsoul it is true.” “I should have stabbed him to the heart, had I been\r\npresent,” returned the aunt. “Yet surely he could have no\r\ndishonourable design; it is impossible! he durst not: besides, his\r\nproposals shew he hath not; for they are not only honourable, but\r\ngenerous. I don't know; the age allows too great freedoms. A distant\r\nsalute is all I would have allowed before the ceremony. I have had\r\nlovers formerly, not so long ago neither; several lovers, though I\r\nnever would consent to marriage, and I never encouraged the least\r\nfreedom. It is a foolish custom, and what I never would agree to. No\r\nman kissed more of me than my cheek. It is as much as one can bring\r\noneself to give lips up to a husband; and, indeed, could I ever have\r\nbeen persuaded to marry, I believe I should not have soon been brought\r\nto endure so much.” “You will pardon me, dear madam,” said Sophia, “if\r\nI make one observation: you own you have had many lovers, and the\r\nworld knows it, even if you should deny it. You refused them all, and,\r\nI am convinced, one coronet at least among them.” “You say true, dear\r\nSophy,” answered she; “I had once the offer of a title.” “Why, then,”\r\n said Sophia, “will you not suffer me to refuse this once?” “It is\r\ntrue, child,” said she, “I have refused the offer of a title; but it\r\nwas not so good an offer; that is, not so very, very good an\r\noffer.”--“Yes, madam,” said Sophia; “but you have had very great\r\nproposals from men of vast fortunes. It was not the first, nor the\r\nsecond, nor the third advantageous match that offered itself.” “I own\r\nit was not,” said she. “Well, madam,” continued Sophia, “and why may\r\nnot I expect to have a second, perhaps, better than this? You are now\r\nbut a young woman, and I am convinced would not promise to yield to\r\nthe first lover of fortune, nay, or of title too. I am a very young\r\nwoman, and sure I need not despair.” “Well, my dear, dear Sophy,”\r\n cries the aunt, “what would you have me say?” “Why, I only beg that I\r\nmay not be left alone, at least this evening; grant me that, and I\r\nwill submit, if you think, after what is past, I ought to see him in\r\nyour company.” “Well, I will grant it,” cries the aunt. “Sophy, you\r\nknow I love you, and can deny you nothing. You know the easiness of my\r\nnature; I have not always been so easy. I have been formerly thought\r\ncruel; by the men, I mean. I was called the cruel Parthenissa. I have\r\nbroke many a window that has had verses to the cruel Parthenissa in\r\nit. Sophy, I was never so handsome as you, and yet I had something of\r\nyou formerly. I am a little altered. Kingdoms and states, as Tully\r\nCicero says in his epistles, undergo alterations, and so must the\r\nhuman form.” Thus run she on for near half an hour upon herself, and\r\nher conquests, and her cruelty, till the arrival of my lord, who,\r\nafter a most tedious visit, during which Mrs Western never once\r\noffered to leave the room, retired, not much more satisfied with the\r\naunt than with the niece; for Sophia had brought her aunt into so\r\nexcellent a temper, that she consented to almost everything her niece\r\nsaid; and agreed that a little distant behaviour might not be improper\r\nto so forward a lover.\r\n\r\nThus Sophia, by a little well-directed flattery, for which surely none\r\nwill blame her, obtained a little ease for herself, and, at least, put\r\noff the evil day. And now we have seen our heroine in a better\r\nsituation than she hath been for a long time before, we will look a\r\nlittle after Mr Jones, whom we left in the most deplorable situation\r\nthat can be well imagined."

      "content": "Mrs Miller and Mr Nightingale visit Jones in the prison.\r\n\nWhen Mr Allworthy and his nephew went to meet Mr Western, Mrs Miller\r\nset forwards to her son-in-law's lodgings, in order to acquaint him\r\nwith the accident which had befallen his friend Jones; but he had\r\nknown it long before from Partridge (for Jones, when he left Mrs\r\nMiller, had been furnished with a room in the same house with Mr\r\nNightingale). The good woman found her daughter under great affliction\r\non account of Mr Jones, whom having comforted as well as she could,\r\nshe set forwards to the Gatehouse, where she heard he was, and where\r\nMr Nightingale was arrived before her.\r\n\r\nThe firmness and constancy of a true friend is a circumstance so\r\nextremely delightful to persons in any kind of distress, that the\r\ndistress itself, if it be only temporary, and admits of relief, is\r\nmore than compensated by bringing this comfort with it. Nor are\r\ninstances of this kind so rare as some superficial and inaccurate\r\nobservers have reported. To say the truth, want of compassion is not\r\nto be numbered among our general faults. The black ingredient which\r\nfouls our disposition is envy. Hence our eye is seldom, I am afraid,\r\nturned upward to those who are manifestly greater, better, wiser, or\r\nhappier than ourselves, without some degree of malignity; while we\r\ncommonly look downwards on the mean and miserable with sufficient\r\nbenevolence and pity. In fact, I have remarked, that most of the\r\ndefects which have discovered themselves in the friendships within my\r\nobservation have arisen from envy only: a hellish vice; and yet one\r\nfrom which I have known very few absolutely exempt. But enough of a\r\nsubject which, if pursued, would lead me too far.\r\n\r\nWhether it was that Fortune was apprehensive lest Jones should sink\r\nunder the weight of his adversity, and that she might thus lose any\r\nfuture opportunity of tormenting him, or whether she really abated\r\nsomewhat of her severity towards him, she seemed a little to relax her\r\npersecution, by sending him the company of two such faithful friends,\r\nand what is perhaps more rare, a faithful servant. For Partridge,\r\nthough he had many imperfections, wanted not fidelity; and though fear\r\nwould not suffer him to be hanged for his master, yet the world, I\r\nbelieve, could not have bribed him to desert his cause.\r\n\r\nWhile Jones was expressing great satisfaction in the presence of his\r\nfriends, Partridge brought an account that Mr Fitzpatrick was still\r\nalive, though the surgeon declared that he had very little hopes. Upon\r\nwhich, Jones fetching a deep sigh, Nightingale said to him, “My dear\r\nTom, why should you afflict yourself so upon an accident, which,\r\nwhatever be the consequence, can be attended with no danger to you,\r\nand in which your conscience cannot accuse you of having been the\r\nleast to blame? If the fellow should die, what have you done more than\r\ntaken away the life of a ruffian in your own defence? So will the\r\ncoroner's inquest certainly find it; and then you will be easily\r\nadmitted to bail; and, though you must undergo the form of a trial,\r\nyet it is a trial which many men would stand for you for a shilling.”\r\n “Come, come, Mr Jones,” says Mrs Miller, “chear yourself up. I knew\r\nyou could not be the aggressor, and so I told Mr Allworthy, and so he\r\nshall acknowledge too, before I have done with him.”\r\n\r\nJones gravely answered, “That whatever might be his fate, he\r\nshould always lament the having shed the blood of one of his\r\nfellow-creatures, as one of the highest misfortunes which could\r\nhave befallen him. But I have another misfortune of the tenderest\r\nkind----O! Mrs Miller, I have lost what I held most dear upon earth.”\r\n “That must be a mistress,” said Mrs Miller; “but come, come; I know\r\nmore than you imagine” (for indeed Partridge had blabbed all); “and I\r\nhave heard more than you know. Matters go better, I promise you, than\r\nyou think; and I would not give Blifil sixpence for all the chance\r\nwhich he hath of the lady.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, my dear friend, indeed,” answered Jones, “you are an entire\r\nstranger to the cause of my grief. If you was acquainted with the\r\nstory, you would allow my case admitted of no comfort. I apprehend no\r\ndanger from Blifil. I have undone myself.” “Don't despair,” replied\r\nMrs Miller; “you know not what a woman can do; and if anything be in\r\nmy power, I promise you I will do it to serve you. It is my duty. My\r\nson, my dear Mr Nightingale, who is so kind to tell me he hath\r\nobligations to you on the same account, knows it is my duty. Shall I\r\ngo to the lady myself? I will say anything to her you would have me\r\nsay.”\r\n\r\n“Thou best of women,” cries Jones, taking her by the hand, “talk not\r\nof obligations to me;--but as you have been so kind to mention it,\r\nthere is a favour which, perhaps, may be in your power. I see you are\r\nacquainted with the lady (how you came by your information I know\r\nnot), who sits, indeed, very near my heart. If you could contrive to\r\ndeliver this (giving her a paper from his pocket), I shall for ever\r\nacknowledge your goodness.”\r\n\r\n“Give it me,” said Mrs Miller. “If I see it not in her own possession\r\nbefore I sleep, may my next sleep be my last! Comfort yourself, my\r\ngood young man! be wise enough to take warning from past follies, and\r\nI warrant all shall be well, and I shall yet see you happy with the\r\nmost charming young lady in the world; for I so hear from every one\r\nshe is.”\r\n\r\n“Believe me, madam,” said he, “I do not speak the common cant of one\r\nin my unhappy situation. Before this dreadful accident happened, I had\r\nresolved to quit a life of which I was become sensible of the\r\nwickedness as well as folly. I do assure you, notwithstanding the\r\ndisturbances I have unfortunately occasioned in your house, for which\r\nI heartily ask your pardon, I am not an abandoned profligate. Though I\r\nhave been hurried into vices, I do not approve a vicious character,\r\nnor will I ever, from this moment, deserve it.”\r\n\r\nMrs Miller expressed great satisfaction in these declarations, in the\r\nsincerity of which she averred she had an entire faith; and now the\r\nremainder of the conversation past in the joint attempts of that good\r\nwoman and Mr Nightingale to cheer the dejected spirits of Mr Jones, in\r\nwhich they so far succeeded as to leave him much better comforted and\r\nsatisfied than they found him; to which happy alteration nothing so\r\nmuch contributed as the kind undertaking of Mrs Miller to deliver his\r\nletter to Sophia, which he despaired of finding any means to\r\naccomplish; for when Black George produced the last from Sophia, he\r\ninformed Partridge that she had strictly charged him, on pain of\r\nhaving it communicated to her father, not to bring her any answer. He\r\nwas, moreover, not a little pleased to find he had so warm an advocate\r\nto Mr Allworthy himself in this good woman, who was, in reality, one\r\nof the worthiest creatures in the world.\r\n\r\nAfter about an hour's visit from the lady (for Nightingale had been\r\nwith him much longer), they both took their leave, promising to return\r\nto him soon; during which Mrs Miller said she hoped to bring him some\r\ngood news from his mistress, and Mr Nightingale promised to enquire\r\ninto the state of Mr Fitzpatrick's wound, and likewise to find out\r\nsome of the persons who were present at the rencounter.\r\n\r\nThe former of these went directly in quest of Sophia, whither we\r\nlikewise shall now attend her."

      "content": "In which Mrs Miller pays a visit to Sophia.\r\n\nAccess to the young lady was by no means difficult; for, as she lived\r\nnow on a perfect friendly footing with her aunt, she was at full\r\nliberty to receive what visitants she pleased.\r\n\r\nSophia was dressing when she was acquainted that there was a\r\ngentlewoman below to wait on her. As she was neither afraid, nor\r\nashamed, to see any of her own sex, Mrs Miller was immediately\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\nCurtsies and the usual ceremonials between women who are strangers to\r\neach other, being past, Sophia said, “I have not the pleasure to know\r\nyou, madam.” “No, madam,” answered Mrs Miller, “and I must beg pardon\r\nfor intruding upon you. But when you know what has induced me to give\r\nyou this trouble, I hope----” “Pray, what is your business, madam?”\r\n said Sophia, with a little emotion. “Madam, we are not alone,” replied\r\nMrs Miller, in a low voice. “Go out, Betty,” said Sophia.\r\n\r\nWhen Betty was departed, Mrs Miller said, “I was desired, madam, by a\r\nvery unhappy young gentleman, to deliver you this letter.” Sophia\r\nchanged colour when she saw the direction, well knowing the hand, and\r\nafter some hesitation, said--“I could not conceive, madam, from your\r\nappearance, that your business had been of such a nature.--Whomever\r\nyou brought this letter from, I shall not open it. I should be sorry\r\nto entertain an unjust suspicion of any one; but you are an utter\r\nstranger to me.”\r\n\r\n“If you will have patience, madam,” answered Mrs Miller, “I will\r\nacquaint you who I am, and how I came by that letter.” “I have no\r\ncuriosity, madam, to know anything,” cries Sophia; “but I must insist\r\non your delivering that letter back to the person who gave it you.”\r\n\r\nMrs Miller then fell upon her knees, and in the most passionate terms\r\nimplored her compassion; to which Sophia answered: “Sure, madam, it is\r\nsurprizing you should be so very strongly interested in the behalf of\r\nthis person. I would not think, madam”--“No, madam,” says Mrs Miller,\r\n“you shall not think anything but the truth. I will tell you all, and\r\nyou will not wonder that I am interested. He is the best-natured\r\ncreature that ever was born.”--She then began and related the story of\r\nMr Anderson.--After this she cried, “This, madam, this is his\r\ngoodness; but I have much more tender obligations to him. He hath\r\npreserved my child.”--Here, after shedding some tears, she related\r\neverything concerning that fact, suppressing only those circumstances\r\nwhich would have most reflected on her daughter, and concluded with\r\nsaying, “Now, madam, you shall judge whether I can ever do enough for\r\nso kind, so good, so generous a young man; and sure he is the best and\r\nworthiest of all human beings.”\r\n\r\nThe alterations in the countenance of Sophia had hitherto been chiefly\r\nto her disadvantage, and had inclined her complexion to too great\r\npaleness; but she now waxed redder, if possible, than vermilion, and\r\ncried, “I know not what to say; certainly what arises from gratitude\r\ncannot be blamed--But what service can my reading this letter do your\r\nfriend, since I am resolved never----” Mrs Miller fell again to her\r\nentreaties, and begged to be forgiven, but she could not, she said,\r\ncarry it back. “Well, madam,” says Sophia, “I cannot help it, if you\r\nwill force it upon me.--Certainly you may leave it whether I will or\r\nno.” What Sophia meant, or whether she meant anything, I will not\r\npresume to determine; but Mrs Miller actually understood this as a\r\nhint, and presently laying the letter down on the table, took her\r\nleave, having first begged permission to wait again on Sophia; which\r\nrequest had neither assent nor denial.\r\n\r\nThe letter lay upon the table no longer than till Mrs Miller was out\r\nof sight; for then Sophia opened and read it.\r\n\r\nThis letter did very little service to his cause; for it consisted of\r\nlittle more than confessions of his own unworthiness, and bitter\r\nlamentations of despair, together with the most solemn protestations\r\nof his unalterable fidelity to Sophia, of which, he said, he hoped to\r\nconvince her, if he had ever more the honour of being admitted to her\r\npresence; and that he could account for the letter to Lady Bellaston\r\nin such a manner, that, though it would not entitle him to her\r\nforgiveness, he hoped at least to obtain it from her mercy. And\r\nconcluded with vowing that nothing was ever less in his thoughts than\r\nto marry Lady Bellaston.\r\n\r\nThough Sophia read the letter twice over with great attention, his\r\nmeaning still remained a riddle to her; nor could her invention\r\nsuggest to her any means to excuse Jones. She certainly remained very\r\nangry with him, though indeed Lady Bellaston took up so much of her\r\nresentment, that her gentle mind had but little left to bestow on any\r\nother person.\r\n\r\nThat lady was most unluckily to dine this very day with her aunt\r\nWestern, and in the afternoon they were all three, by appointment, to\r\ngo together to the opera, and thence to Lady Thomas Hatchet's drum.\r\nSophia would have gladly been excused from all, but would not\r\ndisoblige her aunt; and as to the arts of counterfeiting illness, she\r\nwas so entirely a stranger to them, that it never once entered into\r\nher head. When she was drest, therefore, down she went, resolved to\r\nencounter all the horrors of the day, and a most disagreeable one it\r\nproved; for Lady Bellaston took every opportunity very civilly and\r\nslily to insult her; to all which her dejection of spirits disabled\r\nher from making any return; and, indeed, to confess the truth, she was\r\nat the very best but an indifferent mistress of repartee.\r\n\r\nAnother misfortune which befel poor Sophia was the company of Lord\r\nFellamar, whom she met at the opera, and who attended her to the drum.\r\nAnd though both places were too publick to admit of any\r\nparticularities, and she was farther relieved by the musick at the one\r\nplace, and by the cards at the other, she could not, however, enjoy\r\nherself in his company; for there is something of delicacy in women,\r\nwhich will not suffer them to be even easy in the presence of a man\r\nwhom they know to have pretensions to them which they are disinclined\r\nto favour.\r\n\r\nHaving in this chapter twice mentioned a drum, a word which our\r\nposterity, it is hoped, will not understand in the sense it is here\r\napplied, we shall, notwithstanding our present haste, stop a moment to\r\ndescribe the entertainment here meant, and the rather as we can in a\r\nmoment describe it.\r\n\r\nA drum, then, is an assembly of well-dressed persons of both sexes,\r\nmost of whom play at cards, and the rest do nothing at all; while the\r\nmistress of the house performs the part of the landlady at an inn, and\r\nlike the landlady of an inn prides herself in the number of her\r\nguests, though she doth not always, like her, get anything by it.\r\n\r\nNo wonder then, as so much spirits must be required to support any\r\nvivacity in these scenes of dulness, that we hear persons of fashion\r\neternally complaining of the want of them; a complaint confined\r\nentirely to upper life. How insupportable must we imagine this round\r\nof impertinence to have been to Sophia at this time; how difficult\r\nmust she have found it to force the appearance of gaiety into her\r\nlooks, when her mind dictated nothing but the tenderest sorrow, and\r\nwhen every thought was charged with tormenting ideas!\r\n\r\nNight, however, at last restored her to her pillow, where we will\r\nleave her to soothe her melancholy at least, though incapable we fear\r\nof rest, and shall pursue our history, which, something whispers us,\r\nis now arrived at the eve of some great event."

      "content": "A pathetic scene between Mr Allworthy and Mrs Miller.\r\n\nMrs Miller had a long discourse with Mr Allworthy, at his return from\r\ndinner, in which she acquainted him with Jones's having unfortunately\r\nlost all which he was pleased to bestow on him at their separation;\r\nand with the distresses to which that loss had subjected him; of all\r\nwhich she had received a full account from the faithful retailer\r\nPartridge. She then explained the obligations she had to Jones; not\r\nthat she was entirely explicit with regard to her daughter; for though\r\nshe had the utmost confidence in Mr Allworthy, and though there could\r\nbe no hopes of keeping an affair secret which was unhappily known to\r\nmore than half a dozen, yet she could not prevail with herself to\r\nmention those circumstances which reflected most on the chastity of\r\npoor Nancy, but smothered that part of her evidence as cautiously as\r\nif she had been before a judge, and the girl was now on her trial for\r\nthe murder of a bastard.\r\n\r\nAllworthy said, there were few characters so absolutely vicious as not\r\nto have the least mixture of good in them. “However,” says he, “I\r\ncannot deny but that you have some obligations to the fellow, bad as\r\nhe is, and I shall therefore excuse what hath past already, but must\r\ninsist you never mention his name to me more; for, I promise you, it\r\nwas upon the fullest and plainest evidence that I resolved to take the\r\nmeasures I have taken.” “Well, sir,” says she, “I make not the least\r\ndoubt but time will shew all matters in their true and natural\r\ncolours, and that you will be convinced this poor young man deserves\r\nbetter of you than some other folks that shall be nameless.”\r\n\r\n“Madam,” cries Allworthy, a little ruffled, “I will not hear any\r\nreflections on my nephew; and if ever you say a word more of that\r\nkind, I will depart from your house that instant. He is the worthiest\r\nand best of men; and I once more repeat it to you, he hath carried his\r\nfriendship to this man to a blameable length, by too long concealing\r\nfacts of the blackest die. The ingratitude of the wretch to this good\r\nyoung man is what I most resent; for, madam, I have the greatest\r\nreason to imagine he had laid a plot to supplant my nephew in my\r\nfavour, and to have disinherited him.”\r\n\r\n“I am sure, sir,” answered Mrs Miller, a little frightened (for,\r\nthough Mr Allworthy had the utmost sweetness and benevolence in his\r\nsmiles, he had great terror in his frowns), “I shall never speak\r\nagainst any gentleman you are pleased to think well of. I am sure,\r\nsir, such behaviour would very little become me, especially when the\r\ngentleman is your nearest relation; but, sir, you must not be angry\r\nwith me, you must not indeed, for my good wishes to this poor wretch.\r\nSure I may call him so now, though once you would have been angry with\r\nme if I had spoke of him with the least disrespect. How often have I\r\nheard you call him your son? How often have you prattled to me of him\r\nwith all the fondness of a parent? Nay, sir, I cannot forget the many\r\ntender expressions, the many good things you have told me of his\r\nbeauty, and his parts, and his virtues; of his good-nature and\r\ngenerosity. I am sure, sir, I cannot forget them, for I find them all\r\ntrue. I have experienced them in my own cause. They have preserved my\r\nfamily. You must pardon my tears, sir, indeed you must. When I\r\nconsider the cruel reverse of fortune which this poor youth, to whom I\r\nam so much obliged, hath suffered; when I consider the loss of your\r\nfavour, which I know he valued more than his life, I must, I must\r\nlament him. If you had a dagger in your hand, ready to plunge into my\r\nheart, I must lament the misery of one whom you have loved, and I\r\nshall ever love.”\r\n\r\nAllworthy was pretty much moved with this speech, but it seemed not to\r\nbe with anger; for, after a short silence, taking Mrs Miller by the\r\nhand, he said very affectionately to her, “Come, madam, let us\r\nconsider a little about your daughter. I cannot blame you for\r\nrejoicing in a match which promises to be advantageous to her, but you\r\nknow this advantage, in a great measure, depends on the father's\r\nreconciliation. I know Mr Nightingale very well, and have formerly had\r\nconcerns with him; I will make him a visit, and endeavour to serve you\r\nin this matter. I believe he is a worldly man; but as this is an only\r\nson, and the thing is now irretrievable, perhaps he may in time be\r\nbrought to reason. I promise you I will do all I can for you.”\r\n\r\nMany were the acknowledgments which the poor woman made to Allworthy\r\nfor this kind and generous offer, nor could she refrain from taking\r\nthis occasion again to express her gratitude towards Jones, “to whom,”\r\n said she, “I owe the opportunity of giving you, sir, this present\r\ntrouble.” Allworthy gently stopped her; but he was too good a man to\r\nbe really offended with the effects of so noble a principle as now\r\nactuated Mrs Miller; and indeed, had not this new affair inflamed his\r\nformer anger against Jones, it is possible he might have been a little\r\nsoftened towards him, by the report of an action which malice itself\r\ncould not have derived from an evil motive.\r\n\r\nMr Allworthy and Mrs Miller had been above an hour together, when\r\ntheir conversation was put an end to by the arrival of Blifil and\r\nanother person, which other person was no less than Mr Dowling, the\r\nattorney, who was now become a great favourite with Mr Blifil, and\r\nwhom Mr Allworthy, at the desire of his nephew, had made his steward;\r\nand had likewise recommended him to Mr Western, from whom the attorney\r\nreceived a promise of being promoted to the same office upon the first\r\nvacancy; and, in the meantime, was employed in transacting some\r\naffairs which the squire then had in London in relation to a mortgage.\r\n\r\nThis was the principal affair which then brought Mr Dowling to town;\r\ntherefore he took the same opportunity to charge himself with some\r\nmoney for Mr Allworthy, and to make a report to him of some other\r\nbusiness; in all which, as it was of much too dull a nature to find\r\nany place in this history, we will leave the uncle, nephew, and their\r\nlawyer concerned, and resort to other matters."

      "content": "Containing various matters.\r\n\nBefore we return to Mr Jones, we will take one more view of Sophia.\r\n\r\nThough that young lady had brought her aunt into great good humour by\r\nthose soothing methods which we have before related, she had not\r\nbrought her in the least to abate of her zeal for the match with Lord\r\nFellamar. This zeal was now inflamed by Lady Bellaston, who had told\r\nher the preceding evening, that she was well satisfied from the\r\nconduct of Sophia, and from her carriage to his lordship, that all\r\ndelays would be dangerous, and that the only way to succeed was to\r\npress the match forward with such rapidity that the young lady should\r\nhave no time to reflect, and be obliged to consent while she scarce\r\nknew what she did; in which manner, she said, one-half of the\r\nmarriages among people of condition were brought about. A fact very\r\nprobably true, and to which, I suppose, is owing the mutual tenderness\r\nwhich afterwards exists among so many happy couples.\r\n\r\nA hint of the same kind was given by the same lady to Lord Fellamar;\r\nand both these so readily embraced the advice that the very next day\r\nwas, at his lordship's request, appointed by Mrs Western for a private\r\ninterview between the young parties. This was communicated to Sophia\r\nby her aunt, and insisted upon in such high terms, that, after having\r\nurged everything she possibly could invent against it without the\r\nleast effect, she at last agreed to give the highest instance of\r\ncomplacence which any young lady can give, and consented to see his\r\nlordship.\r\n\r\nAs conversations of this kind afford no great entertainment, we shall\r\nbe excused from reciting the whole that past at this interview; in\r\nwhich, after his lordship had made many declarations of the most pure\r\nand ardent passion to the silent blushing Sophia, she at last\r\ncollected all the spirits she could raise, and with a trembling low\r\nvoice said, “My lord, you must be yourself conscious whether your\r\nformer behaviour to me hath been consistent with the professions you\r\nnow make.” “Is there,” answered he, “no way by which I can atone for\r\nmadness? what I did I am afraid must have too plainly convinced you,\r\nthat the violence of love had deprived me of my senses.” “Indeed, my\r\nlord,” said she, “it is in your power to give me a proof of an\r\naffection which I much rather wish to encourage, and to which I should\r\nthink myself more beholden.” “Name it, madam,” said my lord, very\r\nwarmly. “My lord,” says she, looking down upon her fan, “I know you\r\nmust be sensible how uneasy this pretended passion of yours hath made\r\nme.” “Can you be so cruel to call it pretended?” says he. “Yes, my\r\nlord,” answered Sophia, “all professions of love to those whom we\r\npersecute are most insulting pretences. This pursuit of yours is to me\r\na most cruel persecution: nay, it is taking a most ungenerous\r\nadvantage of my unhappy situation.” “Most lovely, most adorable\r\ncharmer, do not accuse me,” cries he, “of taking an ungenerous\r\nadvantage, while I have no thoughts but what are directed to your\r\nhonour and interest, and while I have no view, no hope, no ambition,\r\nbut to throw myself, honour, fortune, everything at your feet.” “My\r\nlord,” says she, “it is that fortune and those honours which gave you\r\nthe advantage of which I complain. These are the charms which have\r\nseduced my relations, but to me they are things indifferent. If your\r\nlordship will merit my gratitude, there is but one way.” “Pardon me,\r\ndivine creature,” said he, “there can be none. All I can do for you is\r\nso much your due, and will give me so much pleasure, that there is no\r\nroom for your gratitude.” “Indeed, my lord,” answered she, “you may\r\nobtain my gratitude, my good opinion, every kind thought and wish\r\nwhich it is in my power to bestow; nay, you may obtain them with ease,\r\nfor sure to a generous mind it must be easy to grant my request. Let\r\nme beseech you, then, to cease a pursuit in which you can never have\r\nany success. For your own sake as well as mine I entreat this favour;\r\nfor sure you are too noble to have any pleasure in tormenting an\r\nunhappy creature. What can your lordship propose but uneasiness to\r\nyourself, by a perseverance, which, upon my honour, upon my soul,\r\ncannot, shall not prevail with me, whatever distresses you may drive\r\nme to.” Here my lord fetched a deep sigh, and then said--“Is it then,\r\nmadam, that I am so unhappy to be the object of your dislike and\r\nscorn; or will you pardon me if I suspect there is some other?” Here\r\nhe hesitated, and Sophia answered with some spirit, “My lord, I shall\r\nnot be accountable to you for the reasons of my conduct. I am obliged\r\nto your lordship for the generous offer you have made; I own it is\r\nbeyond either my deserts or expectations; yet I hope, my lord, you\r\nwill not insist on my reasons, when I declare I cannot accept it.”\r\n Lord Fellamar returned much to this, which we do not perfectly\r\nunderstand, and perhaps it could not all be strictly reconciled either\r\nto sense or grammar; but he concluded his ranting speech with saying,\r\n“That if she had pre-engaged herself to any gentleman, however unhappy\r\nit would make him, he should think himself bound in honour to desist.”\r\n Perhaps my lord laid too much emphasis on the word gentleman; for we\r\ncannot else well account for the indignation with which he inspired\r\nSophia, who, in her answer, seemed greatly to resent some affront he\r\nhad given her.\r\n\r\nWhile she was speaking, with her voice more raised than usual, Mrs\r\nWestern came into the room, the fire glaring in her cheeks, and the\r\nflames bursting from her eyes. “I am ashamed,” says she, “my lord, of\r\nthe reception which you have met with. I assure your lordship we are\r\nall sensible of the honour done us; and I must tell you, Miss Western,\r\nthe family expect a different behaviour from you.” Here my lord\r\ninterfered on behalf of the young lady, but to no purpose; the aunt\r\nproceeded till Sophia pulled out her handkerchief, threw herself into\r\na chair, and burst into a violent fit of tears.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the conversation between Mrs Western and his\r\nlordship, till the latter withdrew, consisted of bitter lamentations\r\non his side, and on hers of the strongest assurances that her niece\r\nshould and would consent to all he wished. “Indeed, my lord,” says\r\nshe, “the girl hath had a foolish education, neither adapted to her\r\nfortune nor her family. Her father, I am sorry to say it, is to blame\r\nfor everything. The girl hath silly country notions of bashfulness.\r\nNothing else, my lord, upon my honour; I am convinced she hath a good\r\nunderstanding at the bottom, and will be brought to reason.”\r\n\r\nThis last speech was made in the absence of Sophia; for she had some\r\ntime before left the room, with more appearance of passion than she\r\nhad ever shown on any occasion; and now his lordship, after many\r\nexpressions of thanks to Mrs Western, many ardent professions of\r\npassion which nothing could conquer, and many assurances of\r\nperseverance, which Mrs Western highly encouraged, took his leave for\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\nBefore we relate what now passed between Mrs Western and Sophia, it\r\nmay be proper to mention an unfortunate accident which had happened,\r\nand which had occasioned the return of Mrs Western with so much fury,\r\nas we have seen.\r\n\r\nThe reader then must know that the maid who at present attended on\r\nSophia was recommended by Lady Bellaston, with whom she had lived for\r\nsome time in the capacity of a comb-brush: she was a very sensible\r\ngirl, and had received the strictest instructions to watch her young\r\nlady very carefully. These instructions, we are sorry to say, were\r\ncommunicated to her by Mrs Honour, into whose favour Lady Bellaston\r\nhad now so ingratiated herself, that the violent affection which the\r\ngood waiting-woman had formerly borne to Sophia was entirely\r\nobliterated by that great attachment which she had to her new\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\nNow, when Mrs Miller was departed, Betty (for that was the name of the\r\ngirl), returning to her young lady, found her very attentively engaged\r\nin reading a long letter, and the visible emotions which she betrayed\r\non that occasion might have well accounted for some suspicions which\r\nthe girl entertained; but indeed they had yet a stronger foundation,\r\nfor she had overheard the whole scene which passed between Sophia and\r\nMrs Miller.\r\n\r\nMrs Western was acquainted with all this matter by Betty, who, after\r\nreceiving many commendations and some rewards for her fidelity, was\r\nordered, that, if the woman who brought the letter came again, she\r\nshould introduce her to Mrs Western herself.\r\n\r\nUnluckily, Mrs Miller returned at the very time when Sophia was\r\nengaged with his lordship. Betty, according to order, sent her\r\ndirectly to the aunt; who, being mistress of so many circumstances\r\nrelating to what had past the day before, easily imposed upon the poor\r\nwoman to believe that Sophia had communicated the whole affair; and so\r\npumped everything out of her which she knew relating to the letter and\r\nrelating to Jones.\r\n\r\nThis poor creature might, indeed, be called simplicity itself. She was\r\none of that order of mortals who are apt to believe everything which\r\nis said to them; to whom nature hath neither indulged the offensive\r\nnor defensive weapons of deceit, and who are consequently liable to be\r\nimposed upon by any one who will only be at the expense of a little\r\nfalshood for that purpose. Mrs Western, having drained Mrs Miller of\r\nall she knew, which, indeed, was but little, but which was sufficient\r\nto make the aunt suspect a great deal, dismissed her with assurances\r\nthat Sophia would not see her, that she would send no answer to the\r\nletter, nor ever receive another; nor did she suffer her to depart\r\nwithout a handsome lecture on the merits of an office to which she\r\ncould afford no better name than that of procuress.--This discovery\r\nhad greatly discomposed her temper, when, coming into the apartment\r\nnext to that in which the lovers were, she overheard Sophia very\r\nwarmly protesting against his lordship's addresses. At which the rage\r\nalready kindled burst forth, and she rushed in upon her niece in a\r\nmost furious manner, as we have already described, together with what\r\npast at that time till his lordship's departure.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was Lord Fellamar gone than Mrs Western returned to Sophia,\r\nwhom she upbraided in the most bitter terms for the ill use she had\r\nmade of the confidence reposed in her; and for her treachery in\r\nconversing with a man with whom she had offered but the day before to\r\nbind herself in the most solemn oath never more to have any\r\nconversation. Sophia protested she had maintained no such\r\nconversation. “How, how! Miss Western,” said the aunt; “will you deny\r\nyour receiving a letter from him yesterday?” “A letter, madam!”\r\n answered Sophia, somewhat surprized. “It is not very well bred, miss,”\r\n replies the aunt, “to repeat my words. I say a letter, and I insist\r\nupon your showing it me immediately.” “I scorn a lie, madam,” said\r\nSophia; “I did receive a letter, but it was without my desire, and,\r\nindeed, I may say, against my consent.” “Indeed, indeed, miss,” cries\r\nthe aunt, “you ought to be ashamed of owning you had received it at\r\nall; but where is the letter? for I will see it.”\r\n\r\nTo this peremptory demand, Sophia paused some time before she returned\r\nan answer; and at last only excused herself by declaring she had not\r\nthe letter in her pocket, which was, indeed, true; upon which her\r\naunt, losing all manner of patience, asked her niece this short\r\nquestion, whether she would resolve to marry Lord Fellamar, or no? to\r\nwhich she received the strongest negative. Mrs Western then replied\r\nwith an oath, or something very like one, that she would early the\r\nnext morning deliver her back into her father's hand.\r\n\r\nSophia then began to reason with her aunt in the following\r\nmanner:--“Why, madam, must I of necessity be forced to marry at all?\r\nConsider how cruel you would have thought it in your own case, and how\r\nmuch kinder your parents were in leaving you to your liberty. What\r\nhave I done to forfeit this liberty? I will never marry contrary to my\r\nfather's consent, nor without asking yours----And when I ask the\r\nconsent of either improperly, it will be then time enough to force\r\nsome other marriage upon me.” “Can I bear to hear this,” cries Mrs\r\nWestern, “from a girl who hath now a letter from a murderer in her\r\npocket?” “I have no such letter, I promise you,” answered Sophia;\r\n“and, if he be a murderer, he will soon be in no condition to give you\r\nany further disturbance.” “How, Miss Western!” said the aunt, “have\r\nyou the assurance to speak of him in this manner; to own your\r\naffection for such a villain to my face?” “Sure, madam,” said Sophia,\r\n“you put a very strange construction on my words.” “Indeed, Miss\r\nWestern,” cries the lady, “I shall not bear this usage; you have\r\nlearnt of your father this manner of treating me; he hath taught you\r\nto give me the lie. He hath totally ruined you by this false system of\r\neducation; and, please heaven, he shall have the comfort of its\r\nfruits; for once more I declare to you, that to-morrow morning I will\r\ncarry you back. I will withdraw all my forces from the field, and\r\nremain henceforth, like the wise king of Prussia, in a state of\r\nperfect neutrality. You are both too wise to be regulated by my\r\nmeasures; so prepare yourself, for to-morrow morning you shall\r\nevacuate this house.”\r\n\r\nSophia remonstrated all she could; but her aunt was deaf to all she\r\nsaid. In this resolution therefore we must at present leave her, as\r\nthere seems to be no hopes of bringing her to change it."

      "content": "What happened to Mr Jones in the prison.\r\n\nMr Jones passed about twenty-four melancholy hours by himself, unless\r\nwhen relieved by the company of Partridge, before Mr Nightingale\r\nreturned; not that this worthy young man had deserted or forgot his\r\nfriend; for, indeed, he had been much the greatest part of the time\r\nemployed in his service.\r\n\r\nHe had heard, upon enquiry, that the only persons who had seen the\r\nbeginning of the unfortunate rencounter were a crew belonging to a\r\nman-of-war which then lay at Deptford. To Deptford therefore he went\r\nin search of this crew, where he was informed that the men he sought\r\nafter were all gone ashore. He then traced them from place to place,\r\ntill at last he found two of them drinking together, with a third\r\nperson, at a hedge-tavern near Aldersgate.\r\n\r\nNightingale desired to speak with Jones by himself (for Partridge was\r\nin the room when he came in). As soon as they were alone, Nightingale,\r\ntaking Jones by the hand, cried, “Come, my brave friend, be not too\r\nmuch dejected at what I am going to tell you----I am sorry I am the\r\nmessenger of bad news; but I think it my duty to tell you.” “I guess\r\nalready what that bad news is,” cries Jones. “The poor gentleman then\r\nis dead.”--“I hope not,” answered Nightingale. “He was alive this\r\nmorning; though I will not flatter you; I fear, from the accounts I\r\ncould get, that his wound is mortal. But if the affair be exactly as\r\nyou told it, your own remorse would be all you would have reason to\r\napprehend, let what would happen; but forgive me, my dear Tom, if I\r\nentreat you to make the worst of your story to your friends. If you\r\ndisguise anything to us, you will only be an enemy to yourself.”\r\n\r\n“What reason, my dear Jack, have I ever given you,” said Jones, “to\r\nstab me with so cruel a suspicion?” “Have patience,” cries\r\nNightingale, “and I will tell you all. After the most diligent enquiry\r\nI could make, I at last met with two of the fellows who were present\r\nat this unhappy accident, and I am sorry to say, they do not relate\r\nthe story so much in your favour as you yourself have told it.” “Why,\r\nwhat do they say?” cries Jones. “Indeed what I am sorry to repeat, as\r\nI am afraid of the consequence of it to you. They say that they were\r\nat too great a distance to overhear any words that passed between you:\r\nbut they both agree that the first blow was given by you.” “Then, upon\r\nmy soul,” answered Jones, “they injure me. He not only struck me\r\nfirst, but struck me without the least provocation. What should induce\r\nthose villains to accuse me falsely?” “Nay, that I cannot guess,” said\r\nNightingale, “and if you yourself, and I, who am so heartily your\r\nfriend, cannot conceive a reason why they should belie you, what\r\nreason will an indifferent court of justice be able to assign why they\r\nshould not believe them? I repeated the question to them several\r\ntimes, and so did another gentleman who was present, who, I believe,\r\nis a seafaring man, and who really acted a very friendly part by you;\r\nfor he begged them often to consider that there was the life of a man\r\nin the case; and asked them over and over, if they were certain; to\r\nwhich they both answered, that they were, and would abide by their\r\nevidence upon oath. For heaven's sake, my dear friend, recollect\r\nyourself; for, if this should appear to be the fact, it will be your\r\nbusiness to think in time of making the best of your interest. I would\r\nnot shock you; but you know, I believe, the severity of the law,\r\nwhatever verbal provocations may have been given you.” “Alas! my\r\nfriend,” cries Jones, “what interest hath such a wretch as I? Besides,\r\ndo you think I would even wish to live with the reputation of a\r\nmurderer? If I had any friends (as, alas! I have none), could I have\r\nthe confidence to solicit them to speak in the behalf of a man\r\ncondemned for the blackest crime in human nature? Believe me, I have\r\nno such hope; but I have some reliance on a throne still greatly\r\nsuperior; which will, I am certain, afford me all the protection I\r\nmerit.”\r\n\r\nHe then concluded with many solemn and vehement protestations of the\r\ntruth of what he had at first asserted.\r\n\r\nThe faith of Nightingale was now again staggered, and began to incline\r\nto credit his friend, when Mrs Miller appeared, and made a sorrowful\r\nreport of the success of her embassy; which when Jones had heard, he\r\ncried out most heroically, “Well, my friend, I am now indifferent as\r\nto what shall happen, at least with regard to my life; and if it be\r\nthe will of Heaven that I shall make an atonement with that for the\r\nblood I have spilt, I hope the Divine Goodness will one day suffer my\r\nhonour to be cleared, and that the words of a dying man, at least,\r\nwill be believed, so far as to justify his character.”\r\n\r\nA very mournful scene now past between the prisoner and his friends,\r\nat which, as few readers would have been pleased to be present, so\r\nfew, I believe, will desire to hear it particularly related. We will,\r\ntherefore, pass on to the entrance of the turnkey, who acquainted\r\nJones that there was a lady without who desired to speak with him when\r\nhe was at leisure.\r\n\r\nJones declared his surprize at this message. He said, “He knew no lady\r\nin the world whom he could possibly expect to see there.” However, as\r\nhe saw no reason to decline seeing any person, Mrs Miller and Mr\r\nNightingale presently took their leave, and he gave orders to have the\r\nlady admitted.\r\n\r\nIf Jones was surprized at the news of a visit from a lady, how greatly\r\nwas he astonished when he discovered this lady to be no other than Mrs\r\nWaters! In this astonishment then we shall leave him awhile, in order\r\nto cure the surprize of the reader, who will likewise, probably, not a\r\nlittle wonder at the arrival of this lady.\r\n\r\nWho this Mrs Waters was, the reader pretty well knows; what she was,\r\nhe must be perfectly satisfied. He will therefore be pleased to\r\nremember that this lady departed from Upton in the same coach with Mr\r\nFitzpatrick and the other Irish gentleman, and in their company\r\ntravelled to Bath.\r\n\r\nNow there was a certain office in the gift of Mr Fitzpatrick at that\r\ntime vacant, namely that of a wife: for the lady who had lately filled\r\nthat office had resigned, or at least deserted her duty. Mr\r\nFitzpatrick therefore, having thoroughly examined Mrs Waters on the\r\nroad, found her extremely fit for the place, which, on their arrival\r\nat Bath, he presently conferred upon her, and she without any scruple\r\naccepted. As husband and wife this gentleman and lady continued\r\ntogether all the time they stayed at Bath, and as husband and wife\r\nthey arrived together in town.\r\n\r\nWhether Mr Fitzpatrick was so wise a man as not to part with one good\r\nthing till he had secured another, which he had at present only a\r\nprospect of regaining; or whether Mrs Waters had so well discharged\r\nher office, that he intended still to retain her as principal, and to\r\nmake his wife (as is often the case) only her deputy, I will not say;\r\nbut certain it is, he never mentioned his wife to her, never\r\ncommunicated to her the letter given him by Mrs Western, nor ever once\r\nhinted his purpose of repossessing his wife; much less did he ever\r\nmention the name of Jones. For, though he intended to fight with him\r\nwherever he met him, he did not imitate those prudent persons who\r\nthink a wife, a mother, a sister, or sometimes a whole family, the\r\nsafest seconds on these occasions. The first account therefore which\r\nshe had of all this was delivered to her from his lips, after he was\r\nbrought home from the tavern where his wound had been drest.\r\n\r\nAs Mr Fitzpatrick, however, had not the clearest way of telling a\r\nstory at any time, and was now, perhaps, a little more confused than\r\nusual, it was some time before she discovered that the gentleman who\r\nhad given him this wound was the very same person from whom her heart\r\nhad received a wound, which, though not of a mortal kind, was yet so\r\ndeep that it had left a considerable scar behind it. But no sooner was\r\nshe acquainted that Mr Jones himself was the man who had been\r\ncommitted to the Gatehouse for this supposed murder, than she took the\r\nfirst opportunity of committing Mr Fitzpatrick to the care of his\r\nnurse, and hastened away to visit the conqueror.\r\n\r\nShe now entered the room with an air of gaiety, which received an\r\nimmediate check from the melancholy aspect of poor Jones, who started\r\nand blessed himself when he saw her. Upon which she said, “Nay, I do\r\nnot wonder at your surprize; I believe you did not expect to see me;\r\nfor few gentlemen are troubled here with visits from any lady, unless\r\na wife. You see the power you have over me, Mr Jones. Indeed, I little\r\nthought, when we parted at Upton, that our next meeting would have\r\nbeen in such a place.” “Indeed, madam,” says Jones, “I must look upon\r\nthis visit as kind; few will follow the miserable, especially to such\r\ndismal habitations.” “I protest, Mr Jones,” says she, “I can hardly\r\npersuade myself you are the same agreeable fellow I saw at Upton. Why,\r\nyour face is more miserable than any dungeon in the universe. What can\r\nbe the matter with you?” “I thought, madam,” said Jones, “as you knew\r\nof my being here, you knew the unhappy reason.” “Pugh!” says she, “you\r\nhave pinked a man in a duel, that's all.” Jones exprest some\r\nindignation at this levity, and spoke with the utmost contrition for\r\nwhat had happened. To which she answered, “Well, then, sir, if you\r\ntake it so much to heart, I will relieve you; the gentleman is not\r\ndead, and, I am pretty confident, is in no danger of dying. The\r\nsurgeon, indeed, who first dressed him was a young fellow, and seemed\r\ndesirous of representing his case to be as bad as possible, that he\r\nmight have the more honour from curing him: but the king's surgeon\r\nhath seen him since, and says, unless from a fever, of which there are\r\nat present no symptoms, he apprehends not the least danger of life.”\r\n Jones shewed great satisfaction in his countenance at this report;\r\nupon which she affirmed the truth of it, adding, “By the most\r\nextraordinary accident in the world I lodge at the same house; and\r\nhave seen the gentleman, and I promise you he doth you justice, and\r\nsays, whatever be the consequence, that he was entirely the aggressor,\r\nand that you was not in the least to blame.”\r\n\r\nJones expressed the utmost satisfaction at the account which Mrs\r\nWaters brought him. He then informed her of many things which she well\r\nknew before, as who Mr Fitzpatrick was, the occasion of his\r\nresentment, &c. He likewise told her several facts of which she was\r\nignorant, as the adventure of the muff, and other particulars,\r\nconcealing only the name of Sophia. He then lamented the follies and\r\nvices of which he had been guilty; every one of which, he said, had\r\nbeen attended with such ill consequences, that he should be\r\nunpardonable if he did not take warning, and quit those vicious\r\ncourses for the future. He lastly concluded with assuring her of his\r\nresolution to sin no more, lest a worse thing should happen to him.\r\n\r\nMrs Waters with great pleasantry ridiculed all this, as the effects of\r\nlow spirits and confinement. She repeated some witticisms about the\r\ndevil when he was sick, and told him, “She doubted not but shortly to\r\nsee him at liberty, and as lively a fellow as ever; and then,” says\r\nshe, “I don't question but your conscience will be safely delivered of\r\nall these qualms that it is now so sick in breeding.”\r\n\r\nMany more things of this kind she uttered, some of which it would do\r\nher no great honour, in the opinion of some readers, to remember; nor\r\nare we quite certain but that the answers made by Jones would be\r\ntreated with ridicule by others. We shall therefore suppress the rest\r\nof this conversation, and only observe that it ended at last with\r\nperfect innocence, and much more to the satisfaction of Jones than of\r\nthe lady; for the former was greatly transported with the news she had\r\nbrought him; but the latter was not altogether so pleased with the\r\npenitential behaviour of a man whom she had, at her first interview,\r\nconceived a very different opinion of from what she now entertained of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThus the melancholy occasioned by the report of Mr Nightingale was\r\npretty well effaced; but the dejection into which Mrs Miller had\r\nthrown him still continued. The account she gave so well tallied with\r\nthe words of Sophia herself in her letter, that he made not the least\r\ndoubt but that she had disclosed his letter to her aunt, and had taken\r\na fixed resolution to abandon him. The torments this thought gave him\r\nwere to be equalled only by a piece of news which fortune had yet in\r\nstore for him, and which we shall communicate in the second chapter of\r\nthe ensuing book.\r\n\nBOOK XVIII.\r\n\r\nCONTAINING ABOUT SIX DAYS."

As\r\nwe have, therefore, travelled together through so many pages, let us\r\nbehave to one another like fellow-travellers in a stage coach, who\r\nhave passed several days in the company of each other; and who,\r\nnotwithstanding any bickerings or little animosities which may have\r\noccurred on the road, generally make all up at last, and mount, for\r\nthe last time, into their vehicle with chearfulness and good humour;\r\nsince after this one stage, it may possibly happen to us, as it\r\ncommonly happens to them, never to meet more.\r\n\r\nAs I have here taken up this simile, give me leave to carry it a\r\nlittle farther. I intend, then, in this last book, to imitate the good\r\ncompany I have mentioned in their last journey. Now, it is well known\r\nthat all jokes and raillery are at this time laid aside; whatever\r\ncharacters any of the passengers have for the jest-sake personated on\r\nthe road are now thrown off, and the conversation is usually plain and\r\nserious.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner, if I have now and then, in the course of this\r\nwork, indulged any pleasantry for thy entertainment, I shall here lay\r\nit down. The variety of matter, indeed, which I shall be obliged to\r\ncram into this book, will afford no room for any of those ludicrous\r\nobservations which I have elsewhere made, and which may sometimes,\r\nperhaps, have prevented thee from taking a nap when it was beginning\r\nto steal upon thee. In this last book thou wilt find nothing (or at\r\nmost very little) of that nature. All will be plain narrative only;\r\nand, indeed, when thou hast perused the many great events which this\r\nbook will produce, thou wilt think the number of pages contained in it\r\nscarce sufficient to tell the story.\r\n\r\nAnd now, my friend, I take this opportunity (as I shall have no other)\r\nof heartily wishing thee well. If I have been an entertaining\r\ncompanion to thee, I promise thee it is what I have desired. If in\r\nanything I have offended, it was really without any intention. Some\r\nthings, perhaps, here said, may have hit thee or thy friends; but I do\r\nmost solemnly declare they were not pointed at thee or them. I\r\nquestion not but thou hast been told, among other stories of me, that\r\nthou wast to travel with a very scurrilous fellow; but whoever told\r\nthee so did me an injury. No man detests and despises scurrility more\r\nthan myself; nor hath any man more reason; for none hath ever been\r\ntreated with more; and what is a very severe fate, I have had some of\r\nthe abusive writings of those very men fathered upon me, who, in other\r\nof their works, have abused me themselves with the utmost virulence.\r\n\r\nAll these works, however, I am well convinced, will be dead long\r\nbefore this page shall offer itself to thy perusal; for however short\r\nthe period may be of my own performances, they will most probably\r\noutlive their own infirm author, and the weakly productions of his\r\nabusive contemporaries."

      "content": "Containing a very tragical incident.\r\n\nWhile Jones was employed in those unpleasant meditations, with which\r\nwe left him tormenting himself, Partridge came stumbling into the room\r\nwith his face paler than ashes, his eyes fixed in his head, his hair\r\nstanding an end, and every limb trembling. In short, he looked as\r\nhe would have done had he seen a spectre, or had he, indeed, been a\r\nspectre himself.\r\n\r\nJones, who was little subject to fear, could not avoid being somewhat\r\nshocked at this sudden appearance. He did, indeed, himself change\r\ncolour, and his voice a little faultered while he asked him, What was\r\nthe matter?\r\n\r\n“I hope, sir,” said Partridge, “you will not be angry with me. Indeed\r\nI did not listen, but I was obliged to stay in the outward room. I am\r\nsure I wish I had been a hundred miles off, rather than have heard\r\nwhat I have heard.” “Why, what is the matter?” said Jones. “The\r\nmatter, sir? O good Heaven!” answered Partridge, “was that woman who\r\nis just gone out the woman who was with you at Upton?” “She was,\r\nPartridge,” cried Jones. “And did you really, sir, go to bed with that\r\nwoman?” said he, trembling.--“I am afraid what past between us is no\r\nsecret,” said Jones.--“Nay, but pray, sir, for Heaven's sake, sir,\r\nanswer me,” cries Partridge. “You know I did,” cries Jones. “Why then,\r\nthe Lord have mercy upon your soul, and forgive you,” cries Partridge;\r\n“but as sure as I stand here alive, you have been a-bed with your own\r\nmother.”\r\n\r\nUpon these words Jones became in a moment a greater picture of horror\r\nthan Partridge himself. He was, indeed, for some time struck dumb with\r\namazement, and both stood staring wildly at each other. At last his\r\nwords found way, and in an interrupted voice he said, “How! how!\r\nwhat's this you tell me?” “Nay, sir,” cries Partridge, “I have not\r\nbreath enough left to tell you now, but what I have said is most\r\ncertainly true.--That woman who now went out is your own mother. How\r\nunlucky was it for you, sir, that I did not happen to see her at that\r\ntime, to have prevented it! Sure the devil himself must have contrived\r\nto bring about this wickedness.”\r\n\r\n“Sure,” cries Jones, “Fortune will never have done with me till she\r\nhath driven me to distraction. But why do I blame Fortune? I am myself\r\nthe cause of all my misery. All the dreadful mischiefs which have\r\nbefallen me are the consequences only of my own folly and vice. What\r\nthou hast told me, Partridge, hath almost deprived me of my senses!\r\nAnd was Mrs Waters, then--but why do I ask? for thou must certainly\r\nknow her--If thou hast any affection for me, nay, if thou hast any\r\npity, let me beseech thee to fetch this miserable woman back again to\r\nme. O good Heavens! incest----with a mother! To what am I reserved!”\r\n He then fell into the most violent and frantic agonies of grief and\r\ndespair, in which Partridge declared he would not leave him; but at\r\nlast, having vented the first torrent of passion, he came a little to\r\nhimself; and then, having acquainted Partridge that he would find this\r\nwretched woman in the same house where the wounded gentleman was\r\nlodged, he despatched him in quest of her.\r\n\r\nIf the reader will please to refresh his memory, by turning to the\r\nscene at Upton, in the ninth book, he will be apt to admire the many\r\nstrange accidents which unfortunately prevented any interview between\r\nPartridge and Mrs Waters, when she spent a whole day there with Mr\r\nJones. Instances of this kind we may frequently observe in life, where\r\nthe greatest events are produced by a nice train of little\r\ncircumstances; and more than one example of this may be discovered by\r\nthe accurate eye, in this our history.\r\n\r\nAfter a fruitless search of two or three hours, Partridge returned\r\nback to his master, without having seen Mrs Waters. Jones, who was in\r\na state of desperation at his delay, was almost raving mad when he\r\nbrought him his account. He was not long, however, in this condition\r\nbefore he received the following letter:\r\n\r\n “SIR,\r\n\r\n “Since I left you I have seen a gentleman, from whom I have learned\r\n something concerning you which greatly surprizes and affects me; but\r\n as I have not at present leisure to communicate a matter of such\r\n high importance, you must suspend your curiosity till our next\r\n meeting, which shall be the first moment I am able to see you. O, Mr\r\n Jones, little did I think, when I past that happy day at Upton, the\r\n reflection upon which is like to embitter all my future life, who it\r\n was to whom I owed such perfect happiness. Believe me to be ever\r\n sincerely your unfortunate\r\n\r\n “J. WATERS.”\r\n\r\n “P.S. I would have you comfort yourself as much as possible, for Mr\r\n Fitzpatrick is in no manner of danger; so that whatever other\r\n grievous crimes you may have to repent of, the guilt of blood is not\r\n among the number.”\r\n\r\nJones having read the letter, let it drop (for he was unable to hold\r\nit, and indeed had scarce the use of any one of his faculties).\r\nPartridge took it up, and having received consent by silence, read it\r\nlikewise; nor had it upon him a less sensible effect. The pencil, and\r\nnot the pen, should describe the horrors which appeared in both their\r\ncountenances. While they both remained speechless the turnkey entered\r\nthe room, and, without taking any notice of what sufficiently\r\ndiscovered itself in the faces of them both, acquainted Jones that a\r\nman without desired to speak with him. This person was presently\r\nintroduced, and was no other than Black George.\r\n\r\nAs sights of horror were not so usual to George as they were to the\r\nturnkey, he instantly saw the great disorder which appeared in the\r\nface of Jones. This he imputed to the accident that had happened,\r\nwhich was reported in the very worst light in Mr Western's family; he\r\nconcluded, therefore, that the gentleman was dead, and that Mr Jones\r\nwas in a fair way of coming to a shameful end. A thought which gave\r\nhim much uneasiness; for George was of a compassionate disposition,\r\nand notwithstanding a small breach of friendship which he had been\r\nover-tempted to commit, was, in the main, not insensible of the\r\nobligations he had formerly received from Mr Jones.\r\n\r\nThe poor fellow, therefore, scarce refrained from a tear at the\r\npresent sight. He told Jones he was heartily sorry for his\r\nmisfortunes, and begged him to consider if he could be of any manner\r\nof service. “Perhaps, sir,” said he, “you may want a little matter of\r\nmoney upon this occasion; if you do, sir, what little I have is\r\nheartily at your service.”\r\n\r\nJones shook him very heartily by the hand, and gave him many thanks\r\nfor the kind offer he had made; but answered, “He had not the least\r\nwant of that kind.” Upon which George began to press his services more\r\neagerly than before. Jones again thanked him, with assurances that he\r\nwanted nothing which was in the power of any man living to give.\r\n“Come, come, my good master,” answered George, “do not take the matter\r\nso much to heart. Things may end better than you imagine; to be sure\r\nyou an't the first gentleman who hath killed a man, and yet come off.”\r\n “You are wide of the matter, George,” said Partridge, “the gentleman\r\nis not dead, nor like to die. Don't disturb my master, at present, for\r\nhe is troubled about a matter in which it is not in your power to do\r\nhim any good.” “You don't know what I may be able to do, Mr\r\nPartridge,” answered George; “if his concern is about my young lady, I\r\nhave some news to tell my master.” “What do you say, Mr George?” cried\r\nJones. “Hath anything lately happened in which my Sophia is concerned?\r\nMy Sophia! how dares such a wretch as I mention her so profanely.” “I\r\nhope she will be yours yet,” answered George. “Why yes, sir, I have\r\nsomething to tell you about her. Madam Western hath just brought Madam\r\nSophia home, and there hath been a terrible to do. I could not\r\npossibly learn the very right of it; but my master he hath been in a\r\nvast big passion, and so was Madam Western, and I heard her say, as\r\nshe went out of doors into her chair, that she would never set her\r\nfoot in master's house again. I don't know what's the matter, not I,\r\nbut everything was very quiet when I came out; but Robin, who waited\r\nat supper, said he had never seen the squire for a long while in such\r\ngood humour with young madam; that he kissed her several times, and\r\nswore she should be her own mistress, and he never would think of\r\nconfining her any more. I thought this news would please you, and so I\r\nslipped out, though it was so late, to inform you of it.” Mr Jones\r\nassured George that it did greatly please him; for though he should\r\nnever more presume to lift his eyes toward that incomparable creature,\r\nnothing could so much relieve his misery as the satisfaction he should\r\nalways have in hearing of her welfare.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the conversation which passed at the visit is not\r\nimportant enough to be here related. The reader will, therefore,\r\nforgive us this abrupt breaking off, and be pleased to hear how this\r\ngreat good-will of the squire towards his daughter was brought about.\r\n\r\nMrs Western, on her first arrival at her brother's lodging, began to\r\nset forth the great honours and advantages which would accrue to the\r\nfamily by the match with Lord Fellamar, which her niece had absolutely\r\nrefused; in which refusal, when the squire took the part of his\r\ndaughter, she fell immediately into the most violent passion, and so\r\nirritated and provoked the squire, that neither his patience nor his\r\nprudence could bear it any longer; upon which there ensued between\r\nthem both so warm a bout at altercation, that perhaps the regions of\r\nBillingsgate never equalled it. In the heat of this scolding Mrs\r\nWestern departed, and had consequently no leisure to acquaint her\r\nbrother with the letter which Sophia received, which might have\r\npossibly produced ill effects; but, to say truth, I believe it never\r\nonce occurred to her memory at this time.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs Western was gone, Sophia, who had been hitherto silent, as\r\nwell indeed from necessity as inclination, began to return the\r\ncompliment which her father had made her, in taking her part against\r\nher aunt, by taking his likewise against the lady. This was the first\r\ntime of her so doing, and it was in the highest degree acceptable to\r\nthe squire. Again, he remembered that Mr Allworthy had insisted on an\r\nentire relinquishment of all violent means; and, indeed, as he made no\r\ndoubt but that Jones would be hanged, he did not in the least question\r\nsucceeding with his daughter by fair means; he now, therefore, once\r\nmore gave a loose to his natural fondness for her, which had such an\r\neffect on the dutiful, grateful, tender, and affectionate heart of\r\nSophia, that had her honour, given to Jones, and something else,\r\nperhaps, in which he was concerned, been removed, I much doubt whether\r\nshe would not have sacrificed herself to a man she did not like, to\r\nhave obliged her father. She promised him she would make it the whole\r\nbusiness of her life to oblige him, and would never marry any man\r\nagainst his consent; which brought the old man so near to his highest\r\nhappiness, that he was resolved to take the other step, and went to\r\nbed completely drunk."

      "content": "Allworthy visits old Nightingale; with a strange discovery that he\r\nmade on that occasion.\r\n\nThe morning after these things had happened, Mr Allworthy went,\r\naccording to his promise, to visit old Nightingale, with whom his\r\nauthority was so great, that, after having sat with him three hours,\r\nhe at last prevailed with him to consent to see his son.\r\n\r\nHere an accident happened of a very extraordinary kind; one indeed of\r\nthose strange chances whence very good and grave men have concluded\r\nthat Providence often interposes in the discovery of the most secret\r\nvillany, in order to caution men from quitting the paths of honesty,\r\nhowever warily they tread in those of vice.\r\n\r\nMr Allworthy, at his entrance into Mr Nightingale's, saw Black George;\r\nhe took no notice of him, nor did Black George imagine he had\r\nperceived him.\r\n\r\nHowever, when their conversation on the principal point was over,\r\nAllworthy asked Nightingale, Whether he knew one George Seagrim, and\r\nupon what business he came to his house? “Yes,” answered Nightingale,\r\n“I know him very well, and a most extraordinary fellow he is, who, in\r\nthese days, hath been able to hoard up £500 from renting a very small\r\nestate of £30 a year.” “And is this the story which he hath told you?”\r\n cries Allworthy. “Nay, it is true, I promise you,” said Nightingale,\r\n“for I have the money now in my own hands, in five bank-bills, which I\r\nam to lay out either in a mortgage, or in some purchase in the north\r\nof England.” The bank-bills were no sooner produced at Allworthy's\r\ndesire than he blessed himself at the strangeness of the discovery. He\r\npresently told Nightingale that these bank-bills were formerly his,\r\nand then acquainted him with the whole affair. As there are no men who\r\ncomplain more of the frauds of business than highwaymen, gamesters,\r\nand other thieves of that kind, so there are none who so bitterly\r\nexclaim against the frauds of gamesters, &c., as usurers, brokers, and\r\nother thieves of this kind; whether it be that the one way of cheating\r\nis a discountenance or reflection upon the other, or that money, which\r\nis the common mistress of all cheats, makes them regard each other in\r\nthe light of rivals; but Nightingale no sooner heard the story than he\r\nexclaimed against the fellow in terms much severer than the justice\r\nand honesty of Allworthy had bestowed on him.\r\n\r\nAllworthy desired Nightingale to retain both the money and the secret\r\ntill he should hear farther from him; and, if he should in the\r\nmeantime see the fellow, that he would not take the least notice to\r\nhim of the discovery which he had made. He then returned to his\r\nlodgings, where he found Mrs Miller in a very dejected condition, on\r\naccount of the information she had received from her son-in-law. Mr\r\nAllworthy, with great chearfulness, told her that he had much good\r\nnews to communicate; and, with little further preface, acquainted her\r\nthat he had brought Mr Nightingale to consent to see his son, and did\r\nnot in the least doubt to effect a perfect reconciliation between\r\nthem; though he found the father more sowered by another accident of\r\nthe same kind which had happened in his family. He then mentioned the\r\nrunning away of the uncle's daughter, which he had been told by the\r\nold gentleman, and which Mrs Miller and her son-in-law did not yet\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nThe reader may suppose Mrs Miller received this account with great\r\nthankfulness, and no less pleasure; but so uncommon was her friendship\r\nto Jones, that I am not certain whether the uneasiness she suffered\r\nfor his sake did not overbalance her satisfaction at hearing a piece\r\nof news tending so much to the happiness of her own family; nor\r\nwhether even this very news, as it reminded her of the obligations she\r\nhad to Jones, did not hurt as well as please her; when her grateful\r\nheart said to her, “While my own family is happy, how miserable is the\r\npoor creature to whose generosity we owe the beginning of all this\r\nhappiness!”\r\n\r\nAllworthy, having left her a little while to chew the cud (if I may\r\nuse that expression) on these first tidings, told her he had still\r\nsomething more to impart, which he believed would give her pleasure.\r\n“I think,” said he, “I have discovered a pretty considerable treasure\r\nbelonging to the young gentleman, your friend; but perhaps, indeed,\r\nhis present situation may be such that it will be of no service to\r\nhim.” The latter part of the speech gave Mrs Miller to understand who\r\nwas meant, and she answered with a sigh, “I hope not, sir.” “I hope so\r\ntoo,” cries Allworthy, “with all my heart; but my nephew told me this\r\nmorning he had heard a very bad account of the affair.”----“Good\r\nHeaven! sir,” said she--“Well, I must not speak, and yet it is\r\ncertainly very hard to be obliged to hold one's tongue when one\r\nhears.”--“Madam,” said Allworthy, “you may say whatever you please,\r\nyou know me too well to think I have a prejudice against any one; and\r\nas for that young man, I assure you I should be heartily pleased to\r\nfind he could acquit himself of everything, and particularly of this\r\nsad affair. You can testify the affection I have formerly borne him.\r\nThe world, I know, censured me for loving him so much. I did not\r\nwithdraw that affection from him without thinking I had the justest\r\ncause. Believe me, Mrs Miller, I should be glad to find I have been\r\nmistaken.” Mrs Miller was going eagerly to reply, when a servant\r\nacquainted her that a gentleman without desired to speak with her\r\nimmediately. Allworthy then enquired for his nephew, and was told that\r\nhe had been for some time in his room with the gentleman who used to\r\ncome to him, and whom Mr Allworthy guessing rightly to be Mr Dowling,\r\nhe desired presently to speak with him.\r\n\r\nWhen Dowling attended, Allworthy put the case of the bank-notes to\r\nhim, without mentioning any name, and asked in what manner such a\r\nperson might be punished. To which Dowling answered, “He thought he\r\nmight be indicted on the Black Act; but said, as it was a matter of\r\nsome nicety, it would be proper to go to counsel. He said he was to\r\nattend counsel presently upon an affair of Mr Western's, and if Mr\r\nAllworthy pleased he would lay the case before them.” This was agreed\r\nto; and then Mrs Miller, opening the door, cried, “I ask pardon, I did\r\nnot know you had company;” but Allworthy desired her to come in,\r\nsaying he had finished his business. Upon which Mr Dowling withdrew,\r\nand Mrs Miller introduced Mr Nightingale the younger, to return thanks\r\nfor the great kindness done him by Allworthy: but she had scarce\r\npatience to let the young gentleman finish his speech before she\r\ninterrupted him, saying, “O sir! Mr Nightingale brings great news\r\nabout poor Mr Jones: he hath been to see the wounded gentleman, who is\r\nout of all danger of death, and, what is more, declares he fell upon\r\npoor Mr Jones himself, and beat him. I am sure, sir, you would not\r\nhave Mr Jones be a coward. If I was a man myself, I am sure, if any\r\nman was to strike me, I should draw my sword. Do pray, my dear, tell\r\nMr Allworthy, tell him all yourself.” Nightingale then confirmed what\r\nMrs Miller had said; and concluded with many handsome things of Jones,\r\nwho was, he said, one of the best-natured fellows in the world, and\r\nnot in the least inclined to be quarrelsome. Here Nightingale was\r\ngoing to cease, when Mrs Miller again begged him to relate all the\r\nmany dutiful expressions he had heard him make use of towards Mr\r\nAllworthy. “To say the utmost good of Mr Allworthy,” cries\r\nNightingale, “is doing no more than strict justice, and can have no\r\nmerit in it: but indeed, I must say, no man can be more sensible of\r\nthe obligations he hath to so good a man than is poor Jones. Indeed,\r\nsir, I am convinced the weight of your displeasure is the heaviest\r\nburthen he lies under. He hath often lamented it to me, and hath as\r\noften protested in the most solemn manner he hath never been\r\nintentionally guilty of any offence towards you; nay, he hath sworn he\r\nwould rather die a thousand deaths than he would have his conscience\r\nupbraid him with one disrespectful, ungrateful, or undutiful thought\r\ntowards you. But I ask pardon, sir, I am afraid I presume to\r\nintermeddle too far in so tender a point.” “You have spoke no more\r\nthan what a Christian ought,” cries Mrs Miller. “Indeed, Mr\r\nNightingale,” answered Allworthy, “I applaud your generous friendship,\r\nand I wish he may merit it of you. I confess I am glad to hear the\r\nreport you bring from this unfortunate gentleman; and, if that matter\r\nshould turn out to be as you represent it (and, indeed, I doubt\r\nnothing of what you say), I may, perhaps, in time, be brought to think\r\nbetter than lately I have of this young man; for this good gentlewoman\r\nhere, nay, all who know me, can witness that I loved him as dearly as\r\nif he had been my own son. Indeed, I have considered him as a child\r\nsent by fortune to my care. I still remember the innocent, the\r\nhelpless situation in which I found him. I feel the tender pressure of\r\nhis little hands at this moment. He was my darling, indeed he was.” At\r\nwhich words he ceased, and the tears stood in his eyes.\r\n\r\nAs the answer which Mrs Miller made may lead us into fresh matters, we\r\nwill here stop to account for the visible alteration in Mr Allworthy's\r\nmind, and the abatement of his anger to Jones. Revolutions of this\r\nkind, it is true, do frequently occur in histories and dramatic\r\nwriters, for no other reason than because the history or play draws to\r\na conclusion, and are justified by authority of authors; yet, though\r\nwe insist upon as much authority as any author whatever, we shall use\r\nthis power very sparingly, and never but when we are driven to it by\r\nnecessity, which we do not at present foresee will happen in this\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThis alteration then in the mind of Mr Allworthy was occasioned by a\r\nletter he had just received from Mr Square, and which we shall give\r\nthe reader in the beginning of the next chapter."

      "content": "Containing two letters in very different stiles.\r\n\n “MY WORTHY FRIEND,--I informed you in my last that I was forbidden\r\n the use of the waters, as they were found by experience rather to\r\n increase than lessen the symptoms of my distemper. I must now\r\n acquaint you with a piece of news, which, I believe, will afflict my\r\n friends more than it hath afflicted me. Dr Harrington and Dr\r\n Brewster have informed me that there is no hopes of my recovery.\r\n\r\n “I have somewhere read, that the great use of philosophy is to learn\r\n to die. I will not therefore so far disgrace mine as to shew any\r\n surprize at receiving a lesson which I must be thought to have so\r\n long studied. Yet, to say the truth, one page of the Gospel teaches\r\n this lesson better than all the volumes of antient or modern\r\n philosophers. The assurance it gives us of another life is a much\r\n stronger support to a good mind than all the consolations that are\r\n drawn from the necessity of nature, the emptiness or satiety of our\r\n enjoyments here, or any other topic of those declamations which are\r\n sometimes capable of arming our minds with a stubborn patience in\r\n bearing the thoughts of death, but never of raising them to a real\r\n contempt of it, and much less of making us think it is a real good.\r\n I would not here be understood to throw the horrid censure of\r\n atheism, or even the absolute denial of immortality, on all who are\r\n called philosophers. Many of that sect, as well antient as modern,\r\n have, from the light of reason, discovered some hopes of a future\r\n state; but in reality, that light was so faint and glimmering, and\r\n the hopes were so incertain and precarious, that it may be justly\r\n doubted on which side their belief turned. Plato himself concludes\r\n his Phaedon with declaring that his best arguments amount only to\r\n raise a probability; and Cicero himself seems rather to profess an\r\n inclination to believe, than any actual belief in the doctrines of\r\n immortality. As to myself, to be very sincere with you, I never was\r\n much in earnest in this faith till I was in earnest a Christian.\r\n\r\n “You will perhaps wonder at the latter expression; but I assure you\r\n it hath not been till very lately that I could, with truth, call\r\n myself so. The pride of philosophy had intoxicated my reason, and\r\n the sublimest of all wisdom appeared to me, as it did to the Greeks\r\n of old, to be foolishness. God hath, however, been so gracious to\r\n shew me my error in time, and to bring me into the way of truth,\r\n before I sunk into utter darkness forever.\r\n\r\n “I find myself beginning to grow weak, I shall therefore hasten to\r\n the main purpose of this letter.\r\n\r\n “When I reflect on the actions of my past life, I know of nothing\r\n which sits heavier upon my conscience than the injustice I have been\r\n guilty of to that poor wretch your adopted son. I have, indeed, not\r\n only connived at the villany of others, but been myself active in\r\n injustice towards him. Believe me, my dear friend, when I tell you,\r\n on the word of a dying man, he hath been basely injured. As to the\r\n principal fact, upon the misrepresentation of which you discarded\r\n him, I solemnly assure you he is innocent. When you lay upon your\r\n supposed deathbed, he was the only person in the house who testified\r\n any real concern; and what happened afterwards arose from the\r\n wildness of his joy on your recovery; and, I am sorry to say it,\r\n from the baseness of another person (but it is my desire to justify\r\n the innocent, and to accuse none). Believe me, my friend, this young\r\n man hath the noblest generosity of heart, the most perfect capacity\r\n for friendship, the highest integrity, and indeed every virtue which\r\n can ennoble a man. He hath some faults, but among them is not to be\r\n numbered the least want of duty or gratitude towards you. On the\r\n contrary, I am satisfied, when you dismissed him from your house,\r\n his heart bled for you more than for himself.\r\n\r\n “Worldly motives were the wicked and base reasons of my concealing\r\n this from you so long; to reveal it now I can have no inducement but\r\n the desire of serving the cause of truth, of doing right to the\r\n innocent, and of making all the amends in my power for a past\r\n offence. I hope this declaration, therefore, will have the effect\r\n desired, and will restore this deserving young man to your favour;\r\n the hearing of which, while I am yet alive, will afford the utmost\r\n consolation to,\r\n\r\n Sir,\r\n Your most obliged,\r\n obedient humble servant,\r\n THOMAS SQUARE.”\r\n\r\nThe reader will, after this, scarce wonder at the revolution so\r\nvisibly appearing in Mr Allworthy, notwithstanding he received from\r\nThwackum, by the same post, another letter of a very different kind,\r\nwhich we shall here add, as it may possibly be the last time we shall\r\nhave occasion to mention the name of that gentleman.\r\n\r\n “SIR,\r\n\r\n “I am not at all surprized at hearing from your worthy nephew a\r\n fresh instance of the villany of Mr Square the atheist's young\r\n pupil. I shall not wonder at any murders he may commit; and I\r\n heartily pray that your own blood may not seal up his final\r\n commitment to the place of wailing and gnashing of teeth.\r\n\r\n “Though you cannot want sufficient calls to repentance for the many\r\n unwarrantable weaknesses exemplified in your behaviour to this\r\n wretch, so much to the prejudice of your own lawful family, and of\r\n your character; I say, though these may sufficiently be supposed to\r\n prick and goad your conscience at this season, I should yet be\r\n wanting to my duty, if I spared to give you some admonition in order\r\n to bring you to a due sense of your errors. I therefore pray you\r\n seriously to consider the judgment which is likely to overtake this\r\n wicked villain; and let it serve at least as a warning to you, that\r\n you may not for the future despise the advice of one who is so\r\n indefatigable in his prayers for your welfare.\r\n\r\n “Had not my hand been withheld from due correction, I had scourged\r\n much of this diabolical spirit out of a boy, of whom from his\r\n infancy I discovered the devil had taken such entire possession. But\r\n reflections of this kind now come too late.\r\n\r\n “I am sorry you have given away the living of Westerton so hastily.\r\n I should have applied on that occasion earlier, had I thought you\r\n would not have acquainted me previous to the disposition.----Your\r\n objection to pluralities is being righteous over-much. If there were\r\n any crime in the practice, so many godly men would not agree to it.\r\n If the vicar of Aldergrove should die (as we hear he is in a\r\n declining way), I hope you will think of me, since I am certain you\r\n must be convinced of my most sincere attachment to your highest\r\n welfare--a welfare to which all worldly considerations are as\r\n trifling as the small tithes mentioned in Scripture are, when\r\n compared to the weighty matters of the law.\r\n\r\n I am, sir,\r\n Your faithful humble servant,\r\n ROGER THWACKUM.”\r\n\r\nThis was the first time Thwackum ever wrote in this authoritative\r\nstile to Allworthy, and of this he had afterwards sufficient reason to\r\nrepent, as in the case of those who mistake the highest degree of\r\ngoodness for the lowest degree of weakness. Allworthy had indeed never\r\nliked this man. He knew him to be proud and ill-natured; he also knew\r\nthat his divinity itself was tinctured with his temper, and such as in\r\nmany respects he himself did by no means approve; but he was at the\r\nsame time an excellent scholar, and most indefatigable in teaching the\r\ntwo lads. Add to this, the strict severity of his life and manners, an\r\nunimpeached honesty, and a most devout attachment to religion. So\r\nthat, upon the whole, though Allworthy did not esteem nor love the\r\nman, yet he could never bring himself to part with a tutor to the\r\nboys, who was, both by learning and industry, extremely well qualified\r\nfor his office; and he hoped, that as they were bred up in his own\r\nhouse, and under his own eye, he should be able to correct whatever\r\nwas wrong in Thwackum's instructions."

      "title": "Chapter v.",
      "content": "In which the history is continued.\r\n\nMr Allworthy, in his last speech, had recollected some tender ideas\r\nconcerning Jones, which had brought tears into the good man's eyes.\r\nThis Mrs Miller observing, said, “Yes, yes, sir, your goodness to this\r\npoor young man is known, notwithstanding all your care to conceal it;\r\nbut there is not a single syllable of truth in what those villains\r\nsaid. Mr Nightingale hath now discovered the whole matter. It seems\r\nthese fellows were employed by a lord, who is a rival of poor Mr\r\nJones, to have pressed him on board a ship.--I assure them I don't\r\nknow who they will press next. Mr Nightingale here hath seen the\r\nofficer himself, who is a very pretty gentleman, and hath told him\r\nall, and is very sorry for what he undertook, which he would never\r\nhave done, had he known Mr Jones to have been a gentleman; but he was\r\ntold that he was a common strolling vagabond.”\r\n\r\nAllworthy stared at all this, and declared he was a stranger to every\r\nword she said. “Yes, sir,” answered she, “I believe you are.----It is\r\na very different story, I believe, from what those fellows told this\r\nlawyer.”\r\n\r\n“What lawyer, madam? what is it you mean?” said Allworthy. “Nay, nay,”\r\n said she, “this is so like you to deny your own goodness: but Mr\r\nNightingale here saw him.” “Saw whom, madam?” answered he. “Why, your\r\nlawyer, sir,” said she, “that you so kindly sent to enquire into the\r\naffair.” “I am still in the dark, upon my honour,” said Allworthy.\r\n“Why then do you tell him, my dear sir,” cries she. “Indeed, sir,”\r\n said Nightingale, “I did see that very lawyer who went from you when I\r\ncame into the room, at an alehouse in Aldersgate, in company with two\r\nof the fellows who were employed by Lord Fellamar to press Mr Jones,\r\nand who were by that means present at the unhappy rencounter between\r\nhim and Mr Fitzpatrick.” “I own, sir,” said Mrs Miller, “when I saw\r\nthis gentleman come into the room to you, I told Mr Nightingale that I\r\napprehended you had sent him thither to inquire into the affair.”\r\n Allworthy shewed marks of astonishment in his countenance at this\r\nnews, and was indeed for two or three minutes struck dumb by it. At\r\nlast, addressing himself to Mr Nightingale, he said, “I must confess\r\nmyself, sir, more surprized at what you tell me than I have ever been\r\nbefore at anything in my whole life. Are you certain this was the\r\ngentleman?” “I am most certain,” answered Nightingale. “At\r\nAldersgate?” cries Allworthy. “And was you in company with this lawyer\r\nand the two fellows?”--“I was, sir,” said the other, “very near half\r\nan hour.” “Well, sir,” said Allworthy, “and in what manner did the\r\nlawyer behave? did you hear all that past between him and the\r\nfellows?” “No, sir,” answered Nightingale, “they had been together\r\nbefore I came.--In my presence the lawyer said little; but, after I\r\nhad several times examined the fellows, who persisted in a story\r\ndirectly contrary to what I had heard from Mr Jones, and which I find\r\nby Mr Fitzpatrick was a rank falshood, the lawyer then desired the\r\nfellows to say nothing but what was the truth, and seemed to speak so\r\nmuch in favour of Mr Jones, that, when I saw the same person with you,\r\nI concluded your goodness had prompted you to send him thither.”--“And\r\ndid you not send him thither?” says Mrs Miller.--“Indeed I did not,”\r\n answered Allworthy; “nor did I know he had gone on such an errand till\r\nthis moment.”--“I see it all!” said Mrs Miller, “upon my soul, I see\r\nit all! No wonder they have been closeted so close lately. Son\r\nNightingale, let me beg you run for these fellows immediately----find\r\nthem out if they are above-ground. I will go myself”--“Dear madam,”\r\n said Allworthy, “be patient, and do me the favour to send a servant\r\nupstairs to call Mr Dowling hither, if he be in the house, or, if not,\r\nMr Blifil.” Mrs Miller went out muttering something to herself, and\r\npresently returned with an answer, “That Mr Dowling was gone; but that\r\nthe t'other,” as she called him, “was coming.”\r\n\r\nAllworthy was of a cooler disposition than the good woman, whose\r\nspirits were all up in arms in the cause of her friend. He was not\r\nhowever without some suspicions which were near akin to hers. When\r\nBlifil came into the room, he asked him with a very serious\r\ncountenance, and with a less friendly look than he had ever before\r\ngiven him, “Whether he knew anything of Mr Dowling's having seen any\r\nof the persons who were present at the duel between Jones and another\r\ngentleman?”\r\n\r\nThere is nothing so dangerous as a question which comes by surprize on\r\na man whose business it is to conceal truth, or to defend falshood.\r\nFor which reason those worthy personages, whose noble office it is to\r\nsave the lives of their fellow-creatures at the Old Bailey, take the\r\nutmost care, by frequent previous examination, to divine every\r\nquestion which may be asked their clients on the day of tryal, that\r\nthey may be supplyed with proper and ready answers, which the most\r\nfertile invention cannot supply in an instant. Besides, the sudden and\r\nviolent impulse on the blood, occasioned by these surprizes, causes\r\nfrequently such an alteration in the countenance, that the man is\r\nobliged to give evidence against himself. And such indeed were the\r\nalterations which the countenance of Blifil underwent from this sudden\r\nquestion, that we can scarce blame the eagerness of Mrs Miller, who\r\nimmediately cryed out, “Guilty, upon my honour! guilty, upon my soul!”\r\n\r\nMr Allworthy sharply rebuked her for this impetuosity; and then\r\nturning to Blifil, who seemed sinking into the earth, he said, “Why do\r\nyou hesitate, sir, at giving me an answer? You certainly must have\r\nemployed him; for he would not, of his own accord, I believe, have\r\nundertaken such an errand, and especially without acquainting me.”\r\n\r\nBlifil then answered, “I own, sir, I have been guilty of an offence,\r\nyet may I hope your pardon?”--“My pardon,” said Allworthy, very\r\nangrily.--“Nay, sir,” answered Blifil, “I knew you would be offended;\r\nyet surely my dear uncle will forgive the effects of the most amiable\r\nof human weaknesses. Compassion for those who do not deserve it, I own\r\nis a crime; and yet it is a crime from which you yourself are not\r\nentirely free. I know I have been guilty of it in more than one\r\ninstance to this very person; and I will own I did send Mr Dowling,\r\nnot on a vain and fruitless enquiry, but to discover the witnesses,\r\nand to endeavour to soften their evidence. This, sir, is the truth;\r\nwhich, though I intended to conceal from you, I will not deny.”\r\n\r\n“I confess,” said Nightingale, “this is the light in which it appeared\r\nto me from the gentleman's behaviour.”\r\n\r\n“Now, madam,” said Allworthy, “I believe you will once in your life\r\nown you have entertained a wrong suspicion, and are not so angry with\r\nmy nephew as you was.”\r\n\r\nMrs Miller was silent; for, though she could not so hastily be pleased\r\nwith Blifil, whom she looked upon to have been the ruin of Jones, yet\r\nin this particular instance he had imposed upon her as well as upon\r\nthe rest; so entirely had the devil stood his friend. And, indeed, I\r\nlook upon the vulgar observation, “That the devil often deserts his\r\nfriends, and leaves them in the lurch,” to be a great abuse on that\r\ngentleman's character. Perhaps he may sometimes desert those who are\r\nonly his cup acquaintance; or who, at most, are but half his; but he\r\ngenerally stands by those who are thoroughly his servants, and helps\r\nthem off in all extremities, till their bargain expires.\r\n\r\nAs a conquered rebellion strengthens a government, or as health is\r\nmore perfectly established by recovery from some diseases; so anger,\r\nwhen removed, often gives new life to affection. This was the case of\r\nMr Allworthy; for Blifil having wiped off the greater suspicion, the\r\nlesser, which had been raised by Square's letter, sunk of course, and\r\nwas forgotten; and Thwackum, with whom he was greatly offended, bore\r\nalone all the reflections which Square had cast on the enemies of\r\nJones.\r\n\r\nAs for that young man, the resentment of Mr Allworthy began more and\r\nmore to abate towards him. He told Blifil, “He did not only forgive\r\nthe extraordinary efforts of his good-nature, but would give him the\r\npleasure of following his example.” Then, turning to Mrs Miller with a\r\nsmile which would have become an angel, he cryed, “What say you,\r\nmadam? shall we take a hackney-coach, and all of us together pay a\r\nvisit to your friend? I promise you it is not the first visit I have\r\nmade in a prison.”\r\n\r\nEvery reader, I believe, will be able to answer for the worthy woman;\r\nbut they must have a great deal of good-nature, and be well acquainted\r\nwith friendship, who can feel what she felt on this occasion. Few, I\r\nhope, are capable of feeling what now passed in the mind of Blifil;\r\nbut those who are will acknowledge that it was impossible for him to\r\nraise any objection to this visit. Fortune, however, or the gentleman\r\nlately mentioned above, stood his friend, and prevented his undergoing\r\nso great a shock; for at the very instant when the coach was sent for,\r\nPartridge arrived, and, having called Mrs Miller from the company,\r\nacquainted her with the dreadful accident lately come to light; and\r\nhearing Mr Allworthy's intention, begged her to find some means of\r\nstopping him: “For,” says he, “the matter must at all hazards be kept\r\na secret from him; and if he should now go, he will find Mr Jones and\r\nhis mother, who arrived just as I left him, lamenting over one another\r\nthe horrid crime they have ignorantly committed.”\r\n\r\nThe poor woman, who was almost deprived of her senses at his dreadful\r\nnews, was never less capable of invention than at present. However, as\r\nwomen are much readier at this than men, she bethought herself of an\r\nexcuse, and, returning to Allworthy, said, “I am sure, sir, you will\r\nbe surprized at hearing any objection from me to the kind proposal you\r\njust now made; and yet I am afraid of the consequence of it, if\r\ncarried immediately into execution. You must imagine, sir, that all\r\nthe calamities which have lately befallen this poor young fellow must\r\nhave thrown him into the lowest dejection of spirits; and now, sir,\r\nshould we all on a sudden fling him into such a violent fit of joy, as\r\nI know your presence will occasion, it may, I am afraid, produce some\r\nfatal mischief, especially as his servant, who is without, tells me he\r\nis very far from being well.”\r\n\r\n“Is his servant without?” cries Allworthy; “pray call him hither. I\r\nwill ask him some questions concerning his master.”\r\n\r\nPartridge was at first afraid to appear before Mr Allworthy; but was\r\nat length persuaded, after Mrs Miller, who had often heard his whole\r\nstory from his own mouth, had promised to introduce him.\r\n\r\nAllworthy recollected Partridge the moment he came into the room,\r\nthough many years had passed since he had seen him. Mrs Miller,\r\ntherefore, might have spared here a formal oration, in which, indeed,\r\nshe was something prolix; for the reader, I believe, may have observed\r\nalready that the good woman, among other things, had a tongue always\r\nready for the service of her friends.\r\n\r\n“And are you,” said Allworthy to Partridge, “the servant of Mr Jones?”\r\n “I can't say, sir,” answered he, “that I am regularly a servant, but I\r\nlive with him, an't please your honour, at present. _Non sum qualis\r\neram_, as your honour very well knows.”\r\n\r\nMr Allworthy then asked him many questions concerning Jones, as to his\r\nhealth, and other matters; to all which Partridge answered, without\r\nhaving the least regard to what was, but considered only what he would\r\nhave things appear; for a strict adherence to truth was not among the\r\narticles of this honest fellow's morality or his religion.\r\n\r\nDuring this dialogue Mr Nightingale took his leave, and presently\r\nafter Mrs Miller left the room, when Allworthy likewise despatched\r\nBlifil; for he imagined that Partridge when alone with him would be\r\nmore explicit than before company. They were no sooner left in private\r\ntogether than Allworthy began, as in the following chapter."

      "title": "Chapter vi.",
      "content": "In which the history is farther continued\r\n\n“Sure, friend,” said the good man, “you are the strangest of all human\r\nbeings. Not only to have suffered as you have formerly for obstinately\r\npersisting in a falshood, but to persist in it thus to the last, and\r\nto pass thus upon the world for a servant of your own son! What\r\ninterest can you have in all this? What can be your motive?”\r\n\r\n“I see, sir,” said Partridge, falling down upon his knees, “that your\r\nhonour is prepossessed against me, and resolved not to believe\r\nanything I say, and, therefore, what signifies my protestations? but\r\nyet there is one above who knows that I am not the father of this\r\nyoung man.”\r\n\r\n“How!” said Allworthy, “will you yet deny what you was formerly\r\nconvicted of upon such unanswerable, such manifest evidence? Nay, what\r\na confirmation is your being now found with this very man, of all\r\nwhich twenty years ago appeared against you! I thought you had left\r\nthe country! nay, I thought you had been long since dead.--In what\r\nmanner did you know anything of this young man? Where did you meet\r\nwith him, unless you had kept some correspondence together? Do not\r\ndeny this; for I promise you it will greatly raise your son in my\r\nopinion, to find that he hath such a sense of filial duty as privately\r\nto support his father for so many years.”\r\n\r\n“If your honour will have patience to hear me,” said Partridge, “I\r\nwill tell you all.”--Being bid go on, he proceeded thus: “When your\r\nhonour conceived that displeasure against me, it ended in my ruin soon\r\nafter; for I lost my little school; and the minister, thinking I\r\nsuppose it would be agreeable to your honour, turned me out from the\r\noffice of clerk; so that I had nothing to trust to but the barber's\r\nshop, which, in a country place like that, is a poor livelihood; and\r\nwhen my wife died (for till that time I received a pension of £12 a\r\nyear from an unknown hand, which indeed I believe was your honour's\r\nown, for nobody that ever I heard of doth these things besides)--but,\r\nas I was saying, when she died, this pension forsook me; so that now,\r\nas I owed two or three small debts, which began to be troublesome to\r\nme, particularly one[*] which an attorney brought up by law-charges\r\nfrom 15s. to near £30, and as I found all my usual means of living had\r\nforsook me, I packed up my little all as well as I could, and went\r\noff.\r\n\r\n [*] This is a fact which I knew happen to a poor clergyman in\r\n Dorsetshire, by the villany of an attorney who, not contented with\r\n the exorbitant costs to which the poor man was put by a single\r\n action, brought afterwards another action on the judgment, as it was\r\n called. A method frequently used to oppress the poor, and bring\r\n money into the pockets of attorneys, to the great scandal of the\r\n law, of the nation, of Christianity, and even of human nature\r\n itself.\r\n\r\n“The first place I came to was Salisbury, where I got into the service\r\nof a gentleman belonging to the law, and one of the best gentlemen\r\nthat ever I knew, for he was not only good to me, but I know a\r\nthousand good and charitable acts which he did while I staid with him;\r\nand I have known him often refuse business because it was paultry and\r\noppressive.” “You need not be so particular,” said Allworthy; “I know\r\nthis gentleman, and a very worthy man he is, and an honour to his\r\nprofession.”--“Well, sir,” continued Partridge, “from hence I removed\r\nto Lymington, where I was above three years in the service of another\r\nlawyer, who was likewise a very good sort of a man, and to be sure one\r\nof the merriest gentlemen in England. Well, sir, at the end of the\r\nthree years I set up a little school, and was likely to do well again,\r\nhad it not been for a most unlucky accident. Here I kept a pig; and\r\none day, as ill fortune would have it, this pig broke out, and did a\r\ntrespass, I think they call it, in a garden belonging to one of my\r\nneighbours, who was a proud, revengeful man, and employed a lawyer,\r\none--one--I can't think of his name; but he sent for a writ against\r\nme, and had me to size. When I came there, Lord have mercy upon me--to\r\nhear what the counsellors said! There was one that told my lord a\r\nparcel of the confoundedest lies about me; he said that I used to\r\ndrive my hogs into other folk's gardens, and a great deal more; and at\r\nlast he said, he hoped I had at last brought my hogs to a fair market.\r\nTo be sure, one would have thought that, instead of being owner only\r\nof one poor little pig, I had been the greatest hog-merchant in\r\nEngland. Well--” “Pray,” said Allworthy, “do not be so particular, I\r\nhave heard nothing of your son yet.” “O it was a great many years,”\r\n answered Partridge, “before I saw my son, as you are pleased to call\r\nhim.----I went over to Ireland after this, and taught school at Cork\r\n(for that one suit ruined me again, and I lay seven years in\r\nWinchester jail).”--“Well,” said Allworthy, “pass that over till your\r\nreturn to England.”--“Then, sir,” said he, “it was about half a year\r\nago that I landed at Bristol, where I staid some time, and not finding\r\nit do there, and hearing of a place between that and Gloucester where\r\nthe barber was just dead, I went thither, and there I had been about\r\ntwo months when Mr Jones came thither.” He then gave Allworthy a very\r\nparticular account of their first meeting, and of everything, as well\r\nas he could remember, which had happened from that day to this;\r\nfrequently interlarding his story with panegyrics on Jones, and not\r\nforgetting to insinuate the great love and respect which he had for\r\nAllworthy. He concluded with saying, “Now, sir, I have told your\r\nhonour the whole truth.” And then repeated a most solemn protestation,\r\n“That he was no more the father of Jones than of the Pope of Rome;”\r\n and imprecated the most bitter curses on his head, if he did not speak\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\n“What am I to think of this matter?” cries Allworthy. “For what\r\npurpose should you so strongly deny a fact which I think it would be\r\nrather your interest to own?” “Nay, sir,” answered Partridge (for he\r\ncould hold no longer), “if your honour will not believe me, you are\r\nlike soon to have satisfaction enough. I wish you had mistaken the\r\nmother of this young man, as well as you have his father.”--And now\r\nbeing asked what he meant, with all the symptoms of horror, both in\r\nhis voice and countenance, he told Allworthy the whole story, which he\r\nhad a little before expressed such desire to Mrs Miller to conceal\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\nAllworthy was almost as much shocked at this discovery as Partridge\r\nhimself had been while he related it. “Good heavens!” says he, “in\r\nwhat miserable distresses do vice and imprudence involve men! How much\r\nbeyond our designs are the effects of wickedness sometimes carried!”\r\n He had scarce uttered these words, when Mrs Waters came hastily and\r\nabruptly into the room. Partridge no sooner saw her than he cried,\r\n“Here, sir, here is the very woman herself. This is the unfortunate\r\nmother of Mr Jones. I am sure she will acquit me before your honour.\r\nPray, madam----”\r\n\r\nMrs Waters, without paying any regard to what Partridge said, and\r\nalmost without taking any notice of him, advanced to Mr Allworthy. “I\r\nbelieve, sir, it is so long since I had the honour of seeing you, that\r\nyou do not recollect me.” “Indeed,” answered Allworthy, “you are so\r\nvery much altered, on many accounts, that had not this man already\r\nacquainted me who you are, I should not have immediately called you to\r\nmy remembrance. Have you, madam, any particular business which brings\r\nyou to me?” Allworthy spoke this with great reserve; for the reader\r\nmay easily believe he was not well pleased with the conduct of this\r\nlady; neither with what he had formerly heard, nor with what Partridge\r\nhad now delivered.\r\n\r\nMrs Waters answered--“Indeed, sir, I have very particular business\r\nwith you; and it is such as I can impart only to yourself. I must\r\ndesire, therefore, the favour of a word with you alone: for I assure\r\nyou what I have to tell you is of the utmost importance.”\r\n\r\nPartridge was then ordered to withdraw, but before he went, he begged\r\nthe lady to satisfy Mr Allworthy that he was perfectly innocent. To\r\nwhich she answered, “You need be under no apprehension, sir; I shall\r\nsatisfy Mr Allworthy very perfectly of that matter.”\r\n\r\nThen Partridge withdrew, and that past between Mr Allworthy and Mrs\r\nWaters which is written in the next chapter."

      "content": "Continuation of the history.\r\n\nMrs Waters remaining a few moments silent, Mr Allworthy could not\r\nrefrain from saying, “I am sorry, madam, to perceive, by what I have\r\nsince heard, that you have made so very ill a use----” “Mr Allworthy,”\r\n says she, interrupting him, “I know I have faults, but ingratitude to\r\nyou is not one of them. I never can nor shall forget your goodness,\r\nwhich I own I have very little deserved; but be pleased to wave all\r\nupbraiding me at present, as I have so important an affair to\r\ncommunicate to you concerning this young man, to whom you have given\r\nmy maiden name of Jones.”\r\n\r\n“Have I then,” said Allworthy, “ignorantly punished an innocent man,\r\nin the person of him who hath just left us? Was he not the father of\r\nthe child?” “Indeed he was not,” said Mrs Waters. “You may be pleased\r\nto remember, sir, I formerly told you, you should one day know; and I\r\nacknowledge myself to have been guilty of a cruel neglect, in not\r\nhaving discovered it to you before. Indeed, I little knew how\r\nnecessary it was.” “Well, madam,” said Allworthy, “be pleased to\r\nproceed.” “You must remember, sir,” said she, “a young fellow, whose\r\nname was Summer.” “Very well,” cries Allworthy, “he was the son of a\r\nclergyman of great learning and virtue, for whom I had the highest\r\nfriendship.” “So it appeared, sir,” answered she; “for I believe you\r\nbred the young man up, and maintained him at the university; where, I\r\nthink, he had finished his studies, when he came to reside at your\r\nhouse; a finer man, I must say, the sun never shone upon; for, besides\r\nthe handsomest person I ever saw, he was so genteel, and had so much\r\nwit and good breeding.” “Poor gentleman,” said Allworthy, “he was\r\nindeed untimely snatched away; and little did I think he had any sins\r\nof this kind to answer for; for I plainly perceive you are going to\r\ntell me he was the father of your child.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, sir,” answered she, “he was not.” “How!” said Allworthy, “to\r\nwhat then tends all this preface?” “To a story,” said she, “which I am\r\nconcerned falls to my lot to unfold to you. O, sir! prepare to hear\r\nsomething which will surprize you, will grieve you.” “Speak,” said\r\nAllworthy, “I am conscious of no crime, and cannot be afraid to hear.”\r\n “Sir,” said she, “that Mr Summer, the son of your friend, educated at\r\nyour expense, who, after living a year in the house as if he had been\r\nyour own son, died there of the small-pox, was tenderly lamented by\r\nyou, and buried as if he had been your own; that Summer, sir, was the\r\nfather of this child.” “How!” said Allworthy; “you contradict\r\nyourself.” “That I do not,” answered she; “he was indeed the father of\r\nthis child, but not by me.” “Take care, madam,” said Allworthy, “do\r\nnot, to shun the imputation of any crime, be guilty of falshood.\r\nRemember there is One from whom you can conceal nothing, and before\r\nwhose tribunal falshood will only aggravate your guilt.” “Indeed,\r\nsir,” says she, “I am not his mother; nor would I now think myself so\r\nfor the world.” “I know your reason,” said Allworthy, “and shall\r\nrejoice as much as you to find it otherwise; yet you must remember,\r\nyou yourself confest it before me.” “So far what I confest,” said she,\r\n“was true, that these hands conveyed the infant to your bed; conveyed\r\nit thither at the command of its mother; at her commands I afterwards\r\nowned it, and thought myself, by her generosity, nobly rewarded, both\r\nfor my secrecy and my shame.” “Who could this woman be?” said\r\nAllworthy. “Indeed, I tremble to name her,” answered Mrs Waters. “By\r\nall this preparation I am to guess that she was a relation of mine,”\r\n cried he. “Indeed she was a near one.” At which words Allworthy\r\nstarted, and she continued--“You had a sister, sir.” “A sister!”\r\n repeated he, looking aghast.--“As there is truth in heaven,” cries\r\nshe, “your sister was the mother of that child you found between your\r\nsheets.” “Can it be possible?” cries he, “Good heavens!” “Have\r\npatience, sir,” said Mrs Waters, “and I will unfold to you the whole\r\nstory. Just after your departure for London, Miss Bridget came one day\r\nto the house of my mother. She was pleased to say she had heard an\r\nextraordinary character of me, for my learning and superior\r\nunderstanding to all the young women there, so she was pleased to say.\r\nShe then bid me come to her to the great house; where, when I\r\nattended, she employed me to read to her. She expressed great\r\nsatisfaction in my reading, shewed great kindness to me, and made me\r\nmany presents. At last she began to catechise me on the subject of\r\nsecrecy, to which I gave her such satisfactory answers, that, at last,\r\nhaving locked the door of her room, she took me into her closet, and\r\nthen locking that door likewise, she said she should convince me of\r\nthe vast reliance she had on my integrity, by communicating a secret\r\nin which her honour, and consequently her life, was concerned. She\r\nthen stopt, and after a silence of a few minutes, during which she\r\noften wiped her eyes, she enquired of me if I thought my mother might\r\nsafely be confided in. I answered, I would stake my life on her\r\nfidelity. She then imparted to me the great secret which laboured in\r\nher breast, and which, I believe, was delivered with more pains than\r\nshe afterwards suffered in child-birth. It was then contrived that my\r\nmother and myself only should attend at the time, and that Mrs Wilkins\r\nshould be sent out of the way, as she accordingly was, to the very\r\nfurthest part of Dorsetshire, to enquire the character of a servant;\r\nfor the lady had turned away her own maid near three months before;\r\nduring all which time I officiated about her person upon trial, as she\r\nsaid, though, as she afterwards declared, I was not sufficiently handy\r\nfor the place. This, and many other such things which she used to say\r\nof me, were all thrown out to prevent any suspicion which Wilkins\r\nmight hereafter have, when I was to own the child; for she thought it\r\ncould never be believed she would venture to hurt a young woman with\r\nwhom she had intrusted such a secret. You may be assured, sir, I was\r\nwell paid for all these affronts, which, together with being informed\r\nwith the occasion of them, very well contented me. Indeed, the lady\r\nhad a greater suspicion of Mrs Wilkins than of any other person; not\r\nthat she had the least aversion to the gentlewoman, but she thought\r\nher incapable of keeping a secret, especially from you, sir; for I\r\nhave often heard Miss Bridget say, that, if Mrs Wilkins had committed\r\na murder, she believed she would acquaint you with it. At last the\r\nexpected day came, and Mrs Wilkins, who had been kept a week in\r\nreadiness, and put off from time to time, upon some pretence or other,\r\nthat she might not return too soon, was dispatched. Then the child was\r\nborn, in the presence only of myself and my mother, and was by my\r\nmother conveyed to her own house, where it was privately kept by her\r\ntill the evening of your return, when I, by the command of Miss\r\nBridget, conveyed it into the bed where you found it. And all\r\nsuspicions were afterwards laid asleep by the artful conduct of your\r\nsister, in pretending ill-will to the boy, and that any regard she\r\nshewed him was out of meer complacence to you.”\r\n\r\nMrs Waters then made many protestations of the truth of this story,\r\nand concluded by saying, “Thus, sir, you have at last discovered your\r\nnephew; for so I am sure you will hereafter think him, and I question\r\nnot but he will be both an honour and a comfort to you under that\r\nappellation.”\r\n\r\n“I need not, madam,” said Allworthy, “express my astonishment at what\r\nyou have told me; and yet surely you would not, and could not, have\r\nput together so many circumstances to evidence an untruth. I confess I\r\nrecollect some passages relating to that Summer, which formerly gave\r\nme a conceit that my sister had some liking to him. I mentioned it to\r\nher; for I had such a regard to the young man, as well on his own\r\naccount as on his father's, that I should willingly have consented to\r\na match between them; but she exprest the highest disdain of my unkind\r\nsuspicion, as she called it; so that I never spoke more on the\r\nsubject. Good heavens! Well! the Lord disposeth all things.--Yet sure\r\nit was a most unjustifiable conduct in my sister to carry this secret\r\nwith her out of the world.” “I promise you, sir,” said Mrs Waters,\r\n“she always profest a contrary intention, and frequently told me she\r\nintended one day to communicate it to you. She said, indeed, she was\r\nhighly rejoiced that her plot had succeeded so well, and that you had\r\nof your own accord taken such a fancy to the child, that it was yet\r\nunnecessary to make any express declaration. Oh! sir, had that lady\r\nlived to have seen this poor young man turned like a vagabond from\r\nyour house: nay, sir, could she have lived to hear that you had\r\nyourself employed a lawyer to prosecute him for a murder of which he\r\nwas not guilty----Forgive me, Mr Allworthy, I must say it was\r\nunkind.--Indeed, you have been abused, he never deserved it of you.”\r\n “Indeed, madam,” said Allworthy, “I have been abused by the person,\r\nwhoever he was, that told you so.” “Nay, sir,” said she, “I would not\r\nbe mistaken, I did not presume to say you were guilty of any wrong.\r\nThe gentleman who came to me proposed no such matter; he only said,\r\ntaking me for Mr Fitzpatrick's wife, that, if Mr Jones had murdered my\r\nhusband, I should be assisted with any money I wanted to carry on the\r\nprosecution, by a very worthy gentleman, who, he said, was well\r\napprized what a villain I had to deal with. It was by this man I found\r\nout who Mr Jones was; and this man, whose name is Dowling, Mr Jones\r\ntells me is your steward. I discovered his name by a very odd\r\naccident; for he himself refused to tell it me; but Partridge, who met\r\nhim at my lodgings the second time he came, knew him formerly at\r\nSalisbury.”\r\n\r\n“And did this Mr Dowling,” says Allworthy, with great astonishment\r\nin his countenance, “tell you that I would assist in the\r\nprosecution?”--“No, sir,” answered she, “I will not charge him\r\nwrongfully. He said I should be assisted, but he mentioned no name.\r\nYet you must pardon me, sir, if from circumstances I thought it could\r\nbe no other.”--“Indeed, madam,” says Allworthy, “from circumstances I\r\nam too well convinced it was another. Good Heaven! by what wonderful\r\nmeans is the blackest and deepest villany sometimes discovered!--Shall\r\nI beg you, madam, to stay till the person you have mentioned comes,\r\nfor I expect him every minute? nay, he may be, perhaps, already in the\r\nhouse.”\r\n\r\nAllworthy then stept to the door, in order to call a servant, when in\r\ncame, not Mr Dowling, but the gentleman who will be seen in the next\r\nchapter."

      "title": "Chapter viii.",
      "content": "Further continuation.\r\n\nThe gentleman who now arrived was no other than Mr Western. He no\r\nsooner saw Allworthy, than, without considering in the least the\r\npresence of Mrs Waters, he began to vociferate in the following\r\nmanner: “Fine doings at my house! A rare kettle of fish I have\r\ndiscovered at last! who the devil would be plagued with a daughter?”\r\n “What's the matter, neighbour?” said Allworthy. “Matter enough,”\r\n answered Western: “when I thought she was just a coming to; nay, when\r\nshe had in a manner promised me to do as I would ha her, and when I\r\nwas a hoped to have had nothing more to do than to have sent for the\r\nlawyer, and finished all; what do you think I have found out? that the\r\nlittle b-- hath bin playing tricks with me all the while, and carrying\r\non a correspondence with that bastard of yours. Sister Western, whom I\r\nhave quarrelled with upon her account, sent me word o't, and I ordered\r\nher pockets to be searched when she was asleep, and here I have got un\r\nsigned with the son of a whore's own name. I have not had patience to\r\nread half o't, for 'tis longer than one of parson Supple's sermons;\r\nbut I find plainly it is all about love; and indeed what should it be\r\nelse? I have packed her up in chamber again, and to-morrow morning\r\ndown she goes into the country, unless she consents to be married\r\ndirectly, and there she shall live in a garret upon bread and water\r\nall her days; and the sooner such a b-- breaks her heart the better,\r\nthough, d--n her, that I believe is too tough. She will live long\r\nenough to plague me.” “Mr Western,” answered Allworthy, “you know I\r\nhave always protested against force, and you yourself consented that\r\nnone should be used.” “Ay,” cries he, “that was only upon condition\r\nthat she would consent without. What the devil and doctor Faustus!\r\nshan't I do what I will with my own daughter, especially when I desire\r\nnothing but her own good?” “Well, neighbour,” answered Allworthy, “if\r\nyou will give me leave, I will undertake once to argue with the young\r\nlady.” “Will you?” said Western; “why that is kind now, and\r\nneighbourly, and mayhap you will do more than I have been able to do\r\nwith her; for I promise you she hath a very good opinion of you.”\r\n “Well, sir,” said Allworthy, “if you will go home, and release the\r\nyoung lady from her captivity, I will wait upon her within this\r\nhalf-hour.” “But suppose,” said Western, “she should run away with un\r\nin the meantime? For lawyer Dowling tells me there is no hopes of\r\nhanging the fellow at last; for that the man is alive, and like to do\r\nwell, and that he thinks Jones will be out of prison again presently.”\r\n “How!” said Allworthy; “what, did you employ him then to enquire or to\r\ndo anything in that matter?” “Not I,” answered Western, “he mentioned\r\nit to me just now of his own accord.” “Just now!” cries Allworthy,\r\n“why, where did you see him then? I want much to see Mr Dowling.”\r\n “Why, you may see un an you will presently at my lodgings; for there\r\nis to be a meeting of lawyers there this morning about a mortgage.\r\n'Icod! I shall lose two or dree thousand pounds, I believe, by that\r\nhonest gentleman, Mr Nightingale.” “Well, sir,” said Allworthy, “I\r\nwill be with you within the half-hour.” “And do for once,” cries the\r\nsquire, “take a fool's advice; never think of dealing with her by\r\ngentle methods, take my word for it those will never do. I have tried\r\n'um long enough. She must be frightened into it, there is no other\r\nway. Tell her I'm her father; and of the horrid sin of disobedience,\r\nand of the dreadful punishment of it in t'other world, and then tell\r\nher about being locked up all her life in a garret in this, and being\r\nkept only on bread and water.” “I will do all I can,” said Allworthy;\r\n“for I promise you there is nothing I wish for more than an alliance\r\nwith this amiable creature.” “Nay, the girl is well enough for matter\r\no' that,” cries the squire; “a man may go farther and meet with worse\r\nmeat; that I may declare o'her, thof she be my own daughter. And if\r\nshe will but be obedient to me, there is narrow a father within a\r\nhundred miles o' the place, that loves a daughter better than I do;\r\nbut I see you are busy with the lady here, so I will go huome and\r\nexpect you; and so your humble servant.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as Mr Western was gone Mrs Waters said, “I see, sir, the\r\nsquire hath not the least remembrance of my face. I believe, Mr\r\nAllworthy, you would not have known me neither. I am very considerably\r\naltered since that day when you so kindly gave me that advice, which I\r\nhad been happy had I followed.” “Indeed, madam,” cries Allworthy, “it\r\ngave me great concern when I first heard the contrary.” “Indeed, sir,”\r\n says she, “I was ruined by a very deep scheme of villany, which if you\r\nknew, though I pretend not to think it would justify me in your\r\nopinion, it would at least mitigate my offence, and induce you to pity\r\nme: you are not now at leisure to hear my whole story; but this I\r\nassure you, I was betrayed by the most solemn promises of marriage;\r\nnay, in the eye of heaven I was married to him; for, after much\r\nreading on the subject, I am convinced that particular ceremonies are\r\nonly requisite to give a legal sanction to marriage, and have only a\r\nworldly use in giving a woman the privileges of a wife; but that she\r\nwho lives constant to one man, after a solemn private affiance,\r\nwhatever the world may call her, hath little to charge on her own\r\nconscience.” “I am sorry, madam,” said Allworthy, “you made so ill a\r\nuse of your learning. Indeed, it would have been well that you had\r\nbeen possessed of much more, or had remained in a state of ignorance.\r\nAnd yet, madam, I am afraid you have more than this sin to answer\r\nfor.” “During his life,” answered she, “which was above a dozen years,\r\nI most solemnly assure you I had not. And consider, sir, on my behalf,\r\nwhat is in the power of a woman stript of her reputation and left\r\ndestitute; whether the good-natured world will suffer such a stray\r\nsheep to return to the road of virtue, even if she was never so\r\ndesirous. I protest, then, I would have chose it had it been in my\r\npower; but necessity drove me into the arms of Captain Waters, with\r\nwhom, though still unmarried, I lived as a wife for many years, and\r\nwent by his name. I parted with this gentleman at Worcester, on his\r\nmarch against the rebels, and it was then I accidentally met with Mr\r\nJones, who rescued me from the hands of a villain. Indeed, he is the\r\nworthiest of men. No young gentleman of his age is, I believe, freer\r\nfrom vice, and few have the twentieth part of his virtues; nay,\r\nwhatever vices he hath had, I am firmly persuaded he hath now taken a\r\nresolution to abandon them.” “I hope he hath,” cries Allworthy, “and I\r\nhope he will preserve that resolution. I must say, I have still the\r\nsame hopes with regard to yourself. The world, I do agree, are apt to\r\nbe too unmerciful on these occasions; yet time and perseverance will\r\nget the better of this their disinclination, as I may call it, to\r\npity; for though they are not, like heaven, ready to receive a\r\npenitent sinner; yet a continued repentance will at length obtain\r\nmercy even with the world. This you may be assured of, Mrs Waters,\r\nthat whenever I find you are sincere in such good intentions, you\r\nshall want no assistance in my power to make them effectual.”\r\n\r\nMrs Waters fell now upon her knees before him, and, in a flood of\r\ntears, made him many most passionate acknowledgments of his goodness,\r\nwhich, as she truly said, savoured more of the divine than human\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nAllworthy raised her up, and spoke in the most tender manner, making\r\nuse of every expression which his invention could suggest to comfort\r\nher, when he was interrupted by the arrival of Mr Dowling, who, upon\r\nhis first entrance, seeing Mrs Waters, started, and appeared in some\r\nconfusion; from which he soon recovered himself as well as he could,\r\nand then said he was in the utmost haste to attend counsel at Mr\r\nWestern's lodgings; but, however, thought it his duty to call and\r\nacquaint him with the opinion of counsel upon the case which he had\r\nbefore told him, which was that the conversion of the moneys in that\r\ncase could not be questioned in a criminal cause, but that an action\r\nof trover might be brought, and if it appeared to the jury to be the\r\nmoneys of plaintiff, that plaintiff would recover a verdict for the\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nAllworthy, without making any answer to this, bolted the door, and\r\nthen, advancing with a stern look to Dowling, he said, “Whatever be\r\nyour haste, sir, I must first receive an answer to some questions. Do\r\nyou know this lady?”--“That lady, sir!” answered Dowling, with great\r\nhesitation. Allworthy then, with the most solemn voice, said, “Look\r\nyou, Mr Dowling, as you value my favour, or your continuance a moment\r\nlonger in my service, do not hesitate nor prevaricate; but answer\r\nfaithfully and truly to every question I ask.----Do you know this\r\nlady?”--“Yes, sir,” said Dowling, “I have seen the lady.” “Where,\r\nsir?” “At her own lodgings.”--“Upon what business did you go thither,\r\nsir; and who sent you?” “I went, sir, to enquire, sir, about Mr\r\nJones.” “And who sent you to enquire about him?” “Who, sir? why, sir,\r\nMr Blifil sent me.” “And what did you say to the lady concerning that\r\nmatter?” “Nay, sir, it is impossible to recollect every word.” “Will\r\nyou please, madam, to assist the gentleman's memory?” “He told me,\r\nsir,” said Mrs Waters, “that if Mr Jones had murdered my husband, I\r\nshould be assisted by any money I wanted to carry on the prosecution,\r\nby a very worthy gentleman, who was well apprized what a villain I had\r\nto deal with. These, I can safely swear, were the very words he\r\nspoke.”--“Were these the words, sir?” said Allworthy. “I cannot charge\r\nmy memory exactly,” cries Dowling, “but I believe I did speak to that\r\npurpose.”--“And did Mr Blifil order you to say so?” “I am sure, sir, I\r\nshould not have gone on my own accord, nor have willingly exceeded my\r\nauthority in matters of this kind. If I said so, I must have so\r\nunderstood Mr Blifil's instructions.” “Look you, Mr Dowling,” said\r\nAllworthy; “I promise you before this lady, that whatever you have\r\ndone in this affair by Mr Blifil's order I will forgive, provided you\r\nnow tell me strictly the truth; for I believe what you say, that you\r\nwould not have acted of your own accord and without authority in this\r\nmatter.----Mr Blifil then likewise sent you to examine the two fellows\r\nat Aldersgate?”--“He did, sir.” “Well, and what instructions did he\r\nthen give you? Recollect as well as you can, and tell me, as near as\r\npossible, the very words he used.”--“Why, sir, Mr Blifil sent me to\r\nfind out the persons who were eye-witnesses of this fight. He said, he\r\nfeared they might be tampered with by Mr Jones, or some of his\r\nfriends. He said, blood required blood; and that not only all who\r\nconcealed a murderer, but those who omitted anything in their power to\r\nbring him to justice, were sharers in his guilt. He said, he found you\r\nwas very desirous of having the villain brought to justice, though it\r\nwas not proper you should appear in it.” “He did so?” says\r\nAllworthy.--“Yes, sir,” cries Dowling; “I should not, I am sure, have\r\nproceeded such lengths for the sake of any other person living but\r\nyour worship.”--“What lengths, sir?” said Allworthy.--“Nay, sir,”\r\n cries Dowling, “I would not have your worship think I would, on any\r\naccount, be guilty of subornation of perjury; but there are two ways\r\nof delivering evidence. I told them, therefore, that if any offers\r\nshould be made them on the other side, they should refuse them, and\r\nthat they might be assured they should lose nothing by being honest\r\nmen, and telling the truth. I said, we were told that Mr Jones had\r\nassaulted the gentleman first, and that, if that was the truth, they\r\nshould declare it; and I did give them some hints that they should be\r\nno losers.”--“I think you went lengths indeed,” cries\r\nAllworthy.--“Nay, sir,” answered Dowling, “I am sure I did not desire\r\nthem to tell an untruth;----nor should I have said what I did, unless\r\nit had been to oblige you.”--“You would not have thought, I believe,”\r\n says Allworthy, “to have obliged me, had you known that this Mr Jones\r\nwas my own nephew.”--“I am sure, sir,” answered he, “it did not become\r\nme to take any notice of what I thought you desired to\r\nconceal.”--“How!” cries Allworthy, “and did you know it then?”--“Nay,\r\nsir,” answered Dowling, “if your worship bids me speak the truth, I am\r\nsure I shall do it.--Indeed, sir, I did know it; for they were almost\r\nthe last words which Madam Blifil ever spoke, which she mentioned to\r\nme as I stood alone by her bedside, when she delivered me the letter I\r\nbrought your worship from her.”--“What letter?” cries Allworthy.--“The\r\nletter, sir,” answered Dowling, “which I brought from Salisbury, and\r\nwhich I delivered into the hands of Mr Blifil.”--“O heavens!” cries\r\nAllworthy: “Well, and what were the words? What did my sister say to\r\nyou?”--“She took me by the hand,” answered he, “and, as she delivered\r\nme the letter, said, `I scarce know what I have written. Tell my\r\nbrother, Mr Jones is his nephew--He is my son.--Bless him,' says she,\r\nand then fell backward, as if dying away. I presently called in the\r\npeople, and she never spoke more to me, and died within a few minutes\r\nafterwards.”--Allworthy stood a minute silent, lifting up his eyes;\r\nand then, turning to Dowling, said, “How came you, sir, not to deliver\r\nme this message?” “Your worship,” answered he, “must remember that you\r\nwas at that time ill in bed; and, being in a violent hurry, as indeed\r\nI always am, I delivered the letter and message to Mr Blifil, who told\r\nme he would carry them both to you, which he hath since told me he\r\ndid, and that your worship, partly out of friendship to Mr Jones, and\r\npartly out of regard to your sister, would never have it mentioned,\r\nand did intend to conceal it from the world; and therefore, sir, if\r\nyou had not mentioned it to me first, I am certain I should never have\r\nthought it belonged to me to say anything of the matter, either to\r\nyour worship or any other person.”\r\n\r\nWe have remarked somewhere already, that it is possible for a man to\r\nconvey a lie in the words of truth; this was the case at present; for\r\nBlifil had, in fact, told Dowling what he now related, but had not\r\nimposed upon him, nor indeed had imagined he was able so to do. In\r\nreality, the promises which Blifil had made to Dowling were the\r\nmotives which had induced him to secrecy; and, as he now very plainly\r\nsaw Blifil would not be able to keep them, he thought proper now to\r\nmake this confession, which the promises of forgiveness, joined to the\r\nthreats, the voice, the looks of Allworthy, and the discoveries he had\r\nmade before, extorted from him, who was besides taken unawares, and\r\nhad no time to consider of evasions.\r\n\r\nAllworthy appeared well satisfied with this relation, and, having\r\nenjoined on Dowling strict silence as to what had past, conducted that\r\ngentleman himself to the door, lest he should see Blifil, who was\r\nreturned to his chamber, where he exulted in the thoughts of his last\r\ndeceit on his uncle, and little suspected what had since passed\r\nbelow-stairs.\r\n\r\nAs Allworthy was returning to his room he met Mrs Miller in the entry,\r\nwho, with a face all pale and full of terror, said to him, “O! sir, I\r\nfind this wicked woman hath been with you, and you know all; yet do\r\nnot on this account abandon the poor young man. Consider, sir, he was\r\nignorant it was his own mother; and the discovery itself will most\r\nprobably break his heart, without your unkindness.”\r\n\r\n“Madam,” says Allworthy, “I am under such an astonishment at what I\r\nhave heard, that I am really unable to satisfy you; but come with me\r\ninto my room. Indeed, Mrs Miller, I have made surprizing discoveries,\r\nand you shall soon know them.”\r\n\r\nThe poor woman followed him trembling; and now Allworthy, going up to\r\nMrs Waters, took her by the hand, and then, turning to Mrs Miller,\r\nsaid, “What reward shall I bestow upon this gentlewoman, for the\r\nservices she hath done me?--O! Mrs Miller, you have a thousand times\r\nheard me call the young man to whom you are so faithful a friend, my\r\nson. Little did I then think he was indeed related to me at all.--Your\r\nfriend, madam, is my nephew; he is the brother of that wicked viper\r\nwhich I have so long nourished in my bosom.--She will herself tell you\r\nthe whole story, and how the youth came to pass for her son. Indeed,\r\nMrs Miller, I am convinced that he hath been wronged, and that I have\r\nbeen abused; abused by one whom you too justly suspected of being a\r\nvillain. He is, in truth, the worst of villains.”\r\n\r\nThe joy which Mrs Miller now felt bereft her of the power of speech,\r\nand might perhaps have deprived her of her senses, if not of life, had\r\nnot a friendly shower of tears come seasonably to her relief. At\r\nlength, recovering so far from her transport as to be able to speak,\r\nshe cried, “And is my dear Mr Jones then your nephew, sir, and not the\r\nson of this lady? And are your eyes opened to him at last? And shall I\r\nlive to see him as happy as he deserves?” “He certainly is my nephew,”\r\n says Allworthy, “and I hope all the rest.”--“And is this the dear good\r\nwoman, the person,” cries she, “to whom all this discovery is\r\nowing?”--“She is indeed,” says Allworthy.--“Why, then,” cried Mrs\r\nMiller, upon her knees, “may Heaven shower down its choicest blessings\r\nupon her head, and for this one good action forgive her all her sins,\r\nbe they never so many!”\r\n\r\nMrs Waters then informed them that she believed Jones would very\r\nshortly be released; for that the surgeon was gone, in company with a\r\nnobleman, to the justice who committed him, in order to certify that\r\nMr Fitzpatrick was out of all manner of danger, and to procure his\r\nprisoner his liberty.\r\n\r\nAllworthy said he should be glad to find his nephew there at his\r\nreturn home; but that he was then obliged to go on some business of\r\nconsequence. He then called to a servant to fetch him a chair, and\r\npresently left the two ladies together.\r\n\r\nMr Blifil, hearing the chair ordered, came downstairs to attend upon\r\nhis uncle; for he never was deficient in such acts of duty. He asked\r\nhis uncle if he was going out, which is a civil way of asking a man\r\nwhither he is going: to which the other making no answer, he again\r\ndesired to know when he would be pleased to return?--Allworthy made no\r\nanswer to this neither, till he was just going into his chair, and\r\nthen, turning about, he said--“Harkee, sir, do you find out, before my\r\nreturn, the letter which your mother sent me on her death-bed.”\r\n Allworthy then departed, and left Blifil in a situation to be envied\r\nonly by a man who is just going to be hanged."

      "content": "A further continuation.\r\n\nAllworthy took an opportunity, whilst he was in the chair, of reading\r\nthe letter from Jones to Sophia, which Western delivered him; and\r\nthere were some expressions in it concerning himself which drew tears\r\nfrom his eyes. At length he arrived at Mr Western's, and was\r\nintroduced to Sophia.\r\n\r\nWhen the first ceremonies were past, and the gentleman and lady had\r\ntaken their chairs, a silence of some minutes ensued; during which the\r\nlatter, who had been prepared for the visit by her father, sat playing\r\nwith her fan, and had every mark of confusion both in her countenance\r\nand behaviour. At length Allworthy, who was himself a little\r\ndisconcerted, began thus: “I am afraid, Miss Western, my family hath\r\nbeen the occasion of giving you some uneasiness; to which, I fear, I\r\nhave innocently become more instrumental than I intended. Be assured,\r\nmadam, had I at first known how disagreeable the proposals had been, I\r\nshould not have suffered you to have been so long persecuted. I hope,\r\ntherefore, you will not think the design of this visit is to trouble\r\nyou with any further solicitations of that kind, but entirely to\r\nrelieve you from them.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Sophia, with a little modest hesitation, “this behaviour\r\nis most kind and generous, and such as I could expect only from Mr\r\nAllworthy; but as you have been so kind to mention this matter, you\r\nwill pardon me for saying it hath, indeed, given me great uneasiness,\r\nand hath been the occasion of my suffering much cruel treatment from\r\na father who was, till that unhappy affair, the tenderest and fondest\r\nof all parents. I am convinced, sir, you are too good and generous to\r\nresent my refusal of your nephew. Our inclinations are not in our own\r\npower; and whatever may be his merit, I cannot force them in his\r\nfavour.” “I assure you, most amiable young lady,” said Allworthy, “I\r\nam capable of no such resentment, had the person been my own son, and\r\nhad I entertained the highest esteem for him. For you say truly,\r\nmadam, we cannot force our inclinations, much less can they be\r\ndirected by another.” “Oh! sir,” answered Sophia, “every word you\r\nspeak proves you deserve that good, that great, that benevolent\r\ncharacter the whole world allows you. I assure you, sir, nothing less\r\nthan the certain prospect of future misery could have made me resist\r\nthe commands of my father.” “I sincerely believe you, madam,” replied\r\nAllworthy, “and I heartily congratulate you on your prudent\r\nforesight, since by so justifiable a resistance you have avoided\r\nmisery indeed!” “You speak now, Mr Allworthy,” cries she, “with a\r\ndelicacy which few men are capable of feeling! but surely, in my\r\nopinion, to lead our lives with one to whom we are indifferent must\r\nbe a state of wretchedness.----Perhaps that wretchedness would be\r\neven increased by a sense of the merits of an object to whom we\r\ncannot give our affections. If I had married Mr Blifil--” “Pardon my\r\ninterrupting you, madam,” answered Allworthy, “but I cannot bear the\r\nsupposition.--Believe me, Miss Western, I rejoice from my heart, I\r\nrejoice in your escape.--I have discovered the wretch for whom you\r\nhave suffered all this cruel violence from your father to be a\r\nvillain.” “How, sir!” cries Sophia--“you must believe this surprizes\r\nme.”--“It hath surprized me, madam,” answered Allworthy, “and so it\r\nwill the world.----But I have acquainted you with the real truth.”\r\n “Nothing but truth,” says Sophia, “can, I am convinced, come from the\r\nlips of Mr Allworthy.----Yet, sir, such sudden, such unexpected\r\nnews.----Discovered, you say----may villany be ever so!”--“You will\r\nsoon enough hear the story,” cries Allworthy;--“at present let us not\r\nmention so detested a name.--I have another matter of a very serious\r\nnature to propose.--O! Miss Western, I know your vast worth, nor can\r\nI so easily part with the ambition of being allied to it.--I have a\r\nnear relation, madam, a young man whose character is, I am convinced,\r\nthe very opposite to that of this wretch, and whose fortune I will\r\nmake equal to what his was to have been. Could I, madam, hope you\r\nwould admit a visit from him?” Sophia, after a minute's silence,\r\nanswered, “I will deal with the utmost sincerity with Mr Allworthy.\r\nHis character, and the obligation I have just received from him,\r\ndemand it. I have determined at present to listen to no such\r\nproposals from any person. My only desire is to be restored to the\r\naffection of my father, and to be again the mistress of his family.\r\nThis, sir, I hope to owe to your good offices. Let me beseech you,\r\nlet me conjure you, by all the goodness which I, and all who know\r\nyou, have experienced, do not, the very moment when you have released\r\nme from one persecution, do not engage me in another as miserable and\r\nas fruitless.” “Indeed, Miss Western,” replied Allworthy, “I am\r\ncapable of no such conduct; and if this be your resolution, he must\r\nsubmit to the disappointment, whatever torments he may suffer under\r\nit.” “I must smile now, Mr Allworthy,” answered Sophia, “when you\r\nmention the torments of a man whom I do not know, and who can\r\nconsequently have so little acquaintance with me.” “Pardon me, dear\r\nyoung lady,” cries Allworthy, “I begin now to be afraid he hath had\r\ntoo much acquaintance for the repose of his future days; since, if\r\never man was capable of a sincere, violent, and noble passion, such,\r\nI am convinced, is my unhappy nephew's for Miss Western.” “A nephew\r\nof your's, Mr Allworthy!” answered Sophia. “It is surely strange. I\r\nnever heard of him before.” “Indeed, madam,” cries Allworthy, “it is\r\nonly the circumstance of his being my nephew to which you are a\r\nstranger, and which, till this day, was a secret to me.--Mr Jones,\r\nwho has long loved you, he! he is my nephew!” “Mr Jones your nephew,\r\nsir!” cries Sophia, “can it be possible?”--“He is, indeed, madam,”\r\n answered Allworthy; “he is my own sister's son--as such I shall\r\nalways own him; nor am I ashamed of owning him. I am much more\r\nashamed of my past behaviour to him; but I was as ignorant of his\r\nmerit as of his birth. Indeed, Miss Western, I have used him\r\ncruelly----Indeed I have.”--Here the good man wiped his eyes, and\r\nafter a short pause proceeded--“I never shall be able to reward him\r\nfor his sufferings without your assistance.----Believe me, most\r\namiable young lady, I must have a great esteem of that offering which\r\nI make to your worth. I know he hath been guilty of faults; but there\r\nis great goodness of heart at the bottom. Believe me, madam, there\r\nis.” Here he stopped, seeming to expect an answer, which he presently\r\nreceived from Sophia, after she had a little recovered herself from\r\nthe hurry of spirits into which so strange and sudden information had\r\nthrown her: “I sincerely wish you joy, sir, of a discovery in which\r\nyou seem to have such satisfaction. I doubt not but you will have all\r\nthe comfort you can promise yourself from it. The young gentleman\r\nhath certainly a thousand good qualities, which makes it impossible\r\nhe should not behave well to such an uncle.”--“I hope, madam,” said\r\nAllworthy, “he hath those good qualities which must make him a good\r\nhusband.--He must, I am sure, be of all men the most abandoned, if a\r\nlady of your merit should condescend--” “You must pardon me, Mr\r\nAllworthy,” answered Sophia; “I cannot listen to a proposal of this\r\nkind. Mr Jones, I am convinced, hath much merit; but I shall never\r\nreceive Mr Jones as one who is to be my husband--Upon my honour I\r\nnever will.”--“Pardon me, madam,” cries Allworthy, “if I am a little\r\nsurprized, after what I have heard from Mr Western--I hope the\r\nunhappy young man hath done nothing to forfeit your good opinion, if\r\nhe had ever the honour to enjoy it.--Perhaps, he may have been\r\nmisrepresented to you, as he was to me. The same villany may have\r\ninjured him everywhere.--He is no murderer, I assure you; as he hath\r\nbeen called.”--“Mr Allworthy,” answered Sophia, “I have told you my\r\nresolution. I wonder not at what my father hath told you; but,\r\nwhatever his apprehensions or fears have been, if I know my heart, I\r\nhave given no occasion for them; since it hath always been a fixed\r\nprinciple with me, never to have married without his consent. This\r\nis, I think, the duty of a child to a parent; and this, I hope,\r\nnothing could ever have prevailed with me to swerve from. I do not\r\nindeed conceive that the authority of any parent can oblige us to\r\nmarry in direct opposition to our inclinations. To avoid a force of\r\nthis kind, which I had reason to suspect, I left my father's house,\r\nand sought protection elsewhere. This is the truth of my story; and\r\nif the world, or my father, carry my intentions any farther, my own\r\nconscience will acquit me.” “I hear you, Miss Western,” cries\r\nAllworthy, “with admiration. I admire the justness of your\r\nsentiments; but surely there is more in this. I am cautious of\r\noffending you, young lady; but am I to look on all which I have\r\nhitherto heard or seen as a dream only? And have you suffered so much\r\ncruelty from your father on the account of a man to whom you have\r\nbeen always absolutely indifferent?” “I beg, Mr Allworthy,” answered\r\nSophia, “you will not insist on my reasons;--yes, I have suffered\r\nindeed; I will not, Mr Allworthy, conceal----I will be very sincere\r\nwith you--I own I had a great opinion of Mr Jones--I believe--I know\r\nI have suffered for my opinion--I have been treated cruelly by my\r\naunt, as well as by my father; but that is now past--I beg I may not\r\nbe farther pressed; for, whatever hath been, my resolution is now\r\nfixed. Your nephew, sir, hath many virtues--he hath great virtues, Mr\r\nAllworthy. I question not but he will do you honour in the world, and\r\nmake you happy.”--“I wish I could make him so, madam,” replied\r\nAllworthy; “but that I am convinced is only in your power. It is that\r\nconviction which hath made me so earnest a solicitor in his favour.”\r\n “You are deceived indeed, sir; you are deceived,” said Sophia. “I\r\nhope not by him. It is sufficient to have deceived me. Mr Allworthy,\r\nI must insist on being pressed no farther on this subject. I should\r\nbe sorry--nay, I will not injure him in your favour. I wish Mr Jones\r\nvery well. I sincerely wish him well; and I repeat it again to you,\r\nwhatever demerit he may have to me, I am certain he hath many good\r\nqualities. I do not disown my former thoughts; but nothing can ever\r\nrecal them. At present there is not a man upon earth whom I would\r\nmore resolutely reject than Mr Jones; nor would the addresses of Mr\r\nBlifil himself be less agreeable to me.”\r\n\r\nWestern had been long impatient for the event of this conference, and\r\nwas just now arrived at the door to listen; when, having heard the\r\nlast sentiments of his daughter's heart, he lost all temper, and,\r\nbursting open the door in a rage, cried out--“It is a lie! It is a\r\nd--n'd lie! It is all owing to that d--n'd rascal Jones; and if she\r\ncould get at un, she'd ha un any hour of the day.” Here Allworthy\r\ninterposed, and addressing himself to the squire with some anger in\r\nhis look, he said, “Mr Western, you have not kept your word with me.\r\nYou promised to abstain from all violence.”--“Why, so I did,” cries\r\nWestern, “as long as it was possible; but to hear a wench telling such\r\nconfounded lies----Zounds! doth she think, if she can make vools of\r\nother volk, she can make one of me?--No, no, I know her better than\r\nthee dost.” “I am sorry to tell you, sir,” answered Allworthy, “it\r\ndoth not appear, by your behaviour to this young lady, that you know\r\nher at all. I ask pardon for what I say: but I think our intimacy,\r\nyour own desires, and the occasion justify me. She is your daughter,\r\nMr Western, and I think she doth honour to your name. If I was capable\r\nof envy, I should sooner envy you on this account than any other man\r\nwhatever.”--“Odrabbit it!” cries the squire, “I wish she was thine,\r\nwith all my heart--wouldst soon be glad to be rid of the trouble o'\r\nher.” “Indeed, my good friend,” answered Allworthy, “you yourself are\r\nthe cause of all the trouble you complain of. Place that confidence in\r\nthe young lady which she so well deserves, and I am certain you will\r\nbe the happiest father on earth.”--“I confidence in her?” cries the\r\nsquire. “'Sblood! what confidence can I place in her, when she won't\r\ndo as I would ha' her? Let her gi' but her consent to marry as I would\r\nha' her, and I'll place as much confidence in her as wouldst ha'\r\nme.”--“You have no right, neighbour,” answered Allworthy, “to insist\r\non any such consent. A negative voice your daughter allows you, and\r\nGod and nature have thought proper to allow you no more.”--“A negative\r\nvoice!” cries the squire, “Ay! ay! I'll show you what a negative voice\r\nI ha.--Go along, go into your chamber, go, you stubborn----.” “Indeed,\r\nMr Western,” said Allworthy, “indeed you use her cruelly--I cannot\r\nbear to see this--you shall, you must behave to her in a kinder\r\nmanner. She deserves the best of treatment.” “Yes, yes,” said the\r\nsquire, “I know what she deserves: now she's gone, I'll shew you what\r\nshe deserves. See here, sir, here is a letter from my cousin, my Lady\r\nBellaston, in which she is so kind to gi' me to understand that the\r\nfellow is got out of prison again; and here she advises me to take all\r\nthe care I can o' the wench. Odzookers! neighbour Allworthy, you don't\r\nknow what it is to govern a daughter.”\r\n\r\nThe squire ended his speech with some compliments to his own sagacity;\r\nand then Allworthy, after a formal preface, acquainted him with the\r\nwhole discovery which he had made concerning Jones, with his anger to\r\nBlifil, and with every particular which hath been disclosed to the\r\nreader in the preceding chapters.\r\n\r\nMen over-violent in their dispositions are, for the most part, as\r\nchangeable in them. No sooner then was Western informed of Mr\r\nAllworthy's intention to make Jones his heir, than he joined heartily\r\nwith the uncle in every commendation of the nephew, and became as\r\neager for her marriage with Jones as he had before been to couple her\r\nto Blifil.\r\n\r\nHere Mr Allworthy was again forced to interpose, and to relate what\r\nhad passed between him and Sophia, at which he testified great\r\nsurprize.\r\n\r\nThe squire was silent a moment, and looked wild with astonishment at\r\nthis account.--At last he cried out, “Why, what can be the meaning of\r\nthis, neighbour Allworthy? Vond o'un she was, that I'll be sworn\r\nto.----Odzookers! I have hit o't. As sure as a gun I have hit o' the\r\nvery right o't. It's all along o' zister. The girl hath got a\r\nhankering after this son of a whore of a lord. I vound 'em together at\r\nmy cousin my Lady Bellaston's. He hath turned the head o' her, that's\r\ncertain--but d--n me if he shall ha her--I'll ha no lords nor\r\ncourtiers in my vamily.”\r\n\r\nAllworthy now made a long speech, in which he repeated his resolution\r\nto avoid all violent measures, and very earnestly recommended gentle\r\nmethods to Mr Western, as those by which he might be assured of\r\nsucceeding best with his daughter. He then took his leave, and\r\nreturned back to Mrs Miller, but was forced to comply with the earnest\r\nentreaties of the squire, in promising to bring Mr Jones to visit him\r\nthat afternoon, that he might, as he said, “make all matters up with\r\nthe young gentleman.” At Mr Allworthy's departure, Western promised to\r\nfollow his advice in his behaviour to Sophia, saying, “I don't know\r\nhow 'tis, but d--n me, Allworthy, if you don't make me always do just\r\nas you please; and yet I have as good an estate as you, and am in the\r\ncommission of the peace as well as yourself.”"

      "title": "Chapter x.",
      "content": "Wherein the history begins to draw towards a conclusion.\r\n\nWhen Allworthy returned to his lodgings, he heard Mr Jones was just\r\narrived before him. He hurried therefore instantly into an empty\r\nchamber, whither he ordered Mr Jones to be brought to him alone.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to conceive a more tender or moving scene than the\r\nmeeting between the uncle and nephew (for Mrs Waters, as the reader\r\nmay well suppose, had at her last visit discovered to him the secret\r\nof his birth). The first agonies of joy which were felt on both sides\r\nare indeed beyond my power to describe: I shall not therefore attempt\r\nit. After Allworthy had raised Jones from his feet, where he had\r\nprostrated himself, and received him into his arms, “O my child!” he\r\ncried, “how have I been to blame! how have I injured you! What amends\r\ncan I ever make you for those unkind, those unjust suspicions which I\r\nhave entertained, and for all the sufferings they have occasioned to\r\nyou?” “Am I not now made amends?” cries Jones. “Would not my\r\nsufferings, if they had been ten times greater, have been now richly\r\nrepaid? O my dear uncle, this goodness, this tenderness overpowers,\r\nunmans, destroys me. I cannot bear the transports which flow so fast\r\nupon me. To be again restored to your presence, to your favour; to be\r\nonce more thus kindly received by my great, my noble, my generous\r\nbenefactor.”--“Indeed, child,” cries Allworthy, “I have used you\r\ncruelly.”----He then explained to him all the treachery of Blifil, and\r\nagain repeated expressions of the utmost concern, for having been\r\ninduced by that treachery to use him so ill. “O, talk not so!”\r\n answered Jones; “indeed, sir, you have used me nobly. The wisest man\r\nmight be deceived as you were; and, under such a deception, the best\r\nmust have acted just as you did. Your goodness displayed itself in the\r\nmidst of your anger, just as it then seemed. I owe everything to that\r\ngoodness, of which I have been most unworthy. Do not put me on\r\nself-accusation, by carrying your generous sentiments too far. Alas!\r\nsir, I have not been punished more than I have deserved; and it shall\r\nbe the whole business of my future life to deserve that happiness you\r\nnow bestow on me; for, believe me, my dear uncle, my punishment hath\r\nnot been thrown away upon me: though I have been a great, I am not a\r\nhardened sinner; I thank Heaven, I have had time to reflect on my past\r\nlife, where, though I cannot charge myself with any gross villany, yet\r\nI can discern follies and vices more than enough to repent and to be\r\nashamed of; follies which have been attended with dreadful\r\nconsequences to myself, and have brought me to the brink of\r\ndestruction.” “I am rejoiced, my dear child,” answered Allworthy, “to\r\nhear you talk thus sensibly; for as I am convinced hypocrisy (good\r\nHeaven! how have I been imposed on by it in others!) was never among\r\nyour faults, so I can readily believe all you say. You now see, Tom,\r\nto what dangers imprudence alone may subject virtue (for virtue, I am\r\nnow convinced, you love in a great degree). Prudence is indeed the\r\nduty which we owe to ourselves; and if we will be so much our own\r\nenemies as to neglect it, we are not to wonder if the world is\r\ndeficient in discharging their duty to us; for when a man lays the\r\nfoundation of his own ruin, others will, I am afraid, be too apt to\r\nbuild upon it. You say, however, you have seen your errors, and will\r\nreform them. I firmly believe you, my dear child; and therefore, from\r\nthis moment, you shall never be reminded of them by me. Remember them\r\nonly yourself so far as for the future to teach you the better to\r\navoid them; but still remember, for your comfort, that there is this\r\ngreat difference between those faults which candor may construe into\r\nimprudence, and those which can be deduced from villany only. The\r\nformer, perhaps, are even more apt to subject a man to ruin; but if he\r\nreform, his character will, at length, be totally retrieved; the\r\nworld, though not immediately, will in time be reconciled to him; and\r\nhe may reflect, not without some mixture of pleasure, on the dangers\r\nhe hath escaped; but villany, my boy, when once discovered is\r\nirretrievable; the stains which this leaves behind, no time will wash\r\naway. The censures of mankind will pursue the wretch, their scorn will\r\nabash him in publick; and if shame drives him into retirement, he will\r\ngo to it with all those terrors with which a weary child, who is\r\nafraid of hobgoblins, retreats from company to go to bed alone. Here\r\nhis murdered conscience will haunt him.--Repose, like a false friend,\r\nwill fly from him. Wherever he turns his eyes, horror presents itself;\r\nif he looks backward, unavailable repentance treads on his heels; if\r\nforward, incurable despair stares him in the face, till, like a\r\ncondemned prisoner confined in a dungeon, he detests his present\r\ncondition, and yet dreads the consequence of that hour which is to\r\nrelieve him from it. Comfort yourself, I say, my child, that this is\r\nnot your case; and rejoice with thankfulness to him who hath suffered\r\nyou to see your errors, before they have brought on you that\r\ndestruction to which a persistance in even those errors must have led\r\nyou. You have deserted them; and the prospect now before you is such,\r\nthat happiness seems in your own power.” At these words Jones fetched\r\na deep sigh; upon which, when Allworthy remonstrated, he said, “Sir, I\r\nwill conceal nothing from you: I fear there is one consequence of my\r\nvices I shall never be able to retrieve. O, my dear uncle! I have lost\r\na treasure.” “You need say no more,” answered Allworthy; “I will be\r\nexplicit with you; I know what you lament; I have seen the young lady,\r\nand have discoursed with her concerning you. This I must insist on, as\r\nan earnest of your sincerity in all you have said, and of the\r\nstedfastness of your resolution, that you obey me in one instance. To\r\nabide intirely by the determination of the young lady, whether it\r\nshall be in your favour or no. She hath already suffered enough from\r\nsolicitations which I hate to think of; she shall owe no further\r\nconstraint to my family: I know her father will be as ready to torment\r\nher now on your account as he hath formerly been on another's; but I\r\nam determined she shall suffer no more confinement, no more violence,\r\nno more uneasy hours.” “O, my dear uncle!” answered Jones, “lay, I\r\nbeseech you, some command on me, in which I shall have some merit in\r\nobedience. Believe me, sir, the only instance in which I could disobey\r\nyou would be to give an uneasy moment to my Sophia. No, sir, if I am\r\nso miserable to have incurred her displeasure beyond all hope of\r\nforgiveness, that alone, with the dreadful reflection of causing her\r\nmisery, will be sufficient to overpower me. To call Sophia mine is the\r\ngreatest, and now the only additional blessing which heaven can\r\nbestow; but it is a blessing which I must owe to her alone.” “I will\r\nnot flatter you, child,” cries Allworthy; “I fear your case is\r\ndesperate: I never saw stronger marks of an unalterable resolution in\r\nany person than appeared in her vehement declarations against\r\nreceiving your addresses; for which, perhaps, you can account better\r\nthan myself.” “Oh, sir! I can account too well,” answered Jones; “I\r\nhave sinned against her beyond all hope of pardon; and guilty as I am,\r\nmy guilt unfortunately appears to her in ten times blacker than the\r\nreal colours. O, my dear uncle! I find my follies are irretrievable;\r\nand all your goodness cannot save me from perdition.”\r\n\r\nA servant now acquainted them that Mr Western was below-stairs; for\r\nhis eagerness to see Jones could not wait till the afternoon. Upon\r\nwhich Jones, whose eyes were full of tears, begged his uncle to\r\nentertain Western a few minutes, till he a little recovered himself;\r\nto which the good man consented, and, having ordered Mr Western to be\r\nshewn into a parlour, went down to him.\r\n\r\nMrs Miller no sooner heard that Jones was alone (for she had not yet\r\nseen him since his release from prison) than she came eagerly into the\r\nroom, and, advancing towards Jones, wished him heartily joy of his\r\nnew-found uncle and his happy reconciliation; adding, “I wish I could\r\ngive you joy on another account, my dear child; but anything so\r\ninexorable I never saw.”\r\n\r\nJones, with some appearance of surprize, asked her what she meant.\r\n“Why then,” says she, “I have been with your young lady, and have\r\nexplained all matters to her, as they were told to me by my son\r\nNightingale. She can have no longer any doubt about the letter; of\r\nthat I am certain; for I told her my son Nightingale was ready to take\r\nhis oath, if she pleased, that it was all his own invention, and the\r\nletter of his inditing. I told her the very reason of sending the\r\nletter ought to recommend you to her the more, as it was all upon her\r\naccount, and a plain proof that you was resolved to quit all your\r\nprofligacy for the future; that you had never been guilty of a single\r\ninstance of infidelity to her since your seeing her in town: I am\r\nafraid I went too far there; but Heaven forgive me! I hope your future\r\nbehaviour will be my justification. I am sure I have said all I can;\r\nbut all to no purpose. She remains inflexible. She says, she had\r\nforgiven many faults on account of youth; but expressed such\r\ndetestation of the character of a libertine, that she absolutely\r\nsilenced me. I often attempted to excuse you; but the justness of her\r\naccusation flew in my face. Upon my honour, she is a lovely woman, and\r\none of the sweetest and most sensible creatures I ever saw. I could\r\nhave almost kissed her for one expression she made use of. It was a\r\nsentiment worthy of Seneca, or of a bishop. `I once fancied madam.'\r\nand she, `I had discovered great goodness of heart in Mr Jones; and\r\nfor that I own I had a sincere esteem; but an entire profligacy of\r\nmanners will corrupt the best heart in the world; and all which a\r\ngood-natured libertine can expect is, that we should mix some grains\r\nof pity with our contempt and abhorrence.' She is an angelic creature,\r\nthat is the truth on't.” “O, Mrs Miller!” answered Jones, “can I bear\r\nto think that I have lost such an angel?” “Lost! no,” cries Mrs\r\nMiller; “I hope you have not lost her yet. Resolve to leave such\r\nvicious courses, and you may yet have hopes, nay, if she would remain\r\ninexorable, there is another young lady, a sweet pretty young lady,\r\nand a swinging fortune, who is absolutely dying for love of you. I\r\nheard of it this very morning, and I told it to Miss Western; nay, I\r\nwent a little beyond the truth again; for I told her you had refused\r\nher; but indeed I knew you would refuse her. And here I must give you\r\na little comfort; when I mentioned the young lady's name, who is no\r\nother than the pretty widow Hunt, I thought she turned pale; but when\r\nI said you had refused her, I will be sworn her face was all over\r\nscarlet in an instant; and these were her very words: `I will not deny\r\nbut that I believe he has some affection for me.'”\r\n\r\nHere the conversation was interrupted by the arrival of Western, who\r\ncould no longer be kept out of the room even by the authority of\r\nAllworthy himself; though this, as we have often seen, had a wonderful\r\npower over him.\r\n\r\nWestern immediately went up to Jones, crying out, “My old friend Tom,\r\nI am glad to see thee with all my heart! all past must be forgotten; I\r\ncould not intend any affront to thee, because, as Allworthy here\r\nknows, nay, dost know it thyself, I took thee for another person; and\r\nwhere a body means no harm, what signifies a hasty word or two? One\r\nChristian must forget and forgive another.” “I hope, sir,” said Jones,\r\n“I shall never forget the many obligations I have had to you; but as\r\nfor any offence towards me, I declare I am an utter stranger.” “A't,”\r\n says Western, “then give me thy fist; a't as hearty an honest cock as\r\nany in the kingdom. Come along with me; I'll carry thee to thy\r\nmistress this moment.” Here Allworthy interposed; and the squire being\r\nunable to prevail either with the uncle or nephew, was, after some\r\nlitigation, obliged to consent to delay introducing Jones to Sophia\r\ntill the afternoon; at which time Allworthy, as well in compassion to\r\nJones as in compliance with the eager desires of Western, was\r\nprevailed upon to promise to attend at the tea-table.\r\n\r\nThe conversation which now ensued was pleasant enough; and with which,\r\nhad it happened earlier in our history, we would have entertained our\r\nreader; but as we have now leisure only to attend to what is very\r\nmaterial, it shall suffice to say that matters being entirely adjusted\r\nas to the afternoon visit Mr Western again returned home."

      "content": "The history draws nearer to a conclusion.\r\n\nWhen Mr Western was departed, Jones began to inform Mr Allworthy and\r\nMrs Miller that his liberty had been procured by two noble lords, who,\r\ntogether with two surgeons and a friend of Mr Nightingale's, had\r\nattended the magistrate by whom he had been committed, and by whom, on\r\nthe surgeons' oaths, that the wounded person was out of all manner of\r\ndanger from his wound, he was discharged.\r\n\r\nOne only of these lords, he said, he had ever seen before, and that no\r\nmore than once; but the other had greatly surprized him by asking his\r\npardon for an offence he had been guilty of towards him, occasioned,\r\nhe said, entirely by his ignorance who he was.\r\n\r\nNow the reality of the case, with which Jones was not acquainted till\r\nafterwards, was this:--The lieutenant whom Lord Fellamar had employed,\r\naccording to the advice of Lady Bellaston, to press Jones as a\r\nvagabond into the sea-service, when he came to report to his lordship\r\nthe event which we have before seen, spoke very favourably of the\r\nbehaviour of Mr Jones on all accounts, and strongly assured that lord\r\nthat he must have mistaken the person, for that Jones was certainly a\r\ngentleman; insomuch that his lordship, who was strictly a man of\r\nhonour, and would by no means have been guilty of an action which the\r\nworld in general would have condemned, began to be much concerned for\r\nthe advice which he had taken.\r\n\r\nWithin a day or two after this, Lord Fellamar happened to dine with\r\nthe Irish peer, who, in a conversation upon the duel, acquainted his\r\ncompany with the character of Fitzpatrick; to which, indeed, he did\r\nnot do strict justice, especially in what related to his lady. He said\r\nshe was the most innocent, the most injured woman alive, and that from\r\ncompassion alone he had undertaken her cause. He then declared an\r\nintention of going the next morning to Fitzpatrick's lodgings, in\r\norder to prevail with him, if possible, to consent to a separation\r\nfrom his wife, who, the peer said, was in apprehensions for her life,\r\nif she should ever return to be under the power of her husband. Lord\r\nFellamar agreed to go with him, that he might satisfy himself more\r\nconcerning Jones and the circumstances of the duel; for he was by no\r\nmeans easy concerning the part he had acted. The moment his lordship\r\ngave a hint of his readiness to assist in the delivery of the lady, it\r\nwas eagerly embraced by the other nobleman, who depended much on the\r\nauthority of Lord Fellamar, as he thought it would greatly contribute\r\nto awe Fitzpatrick into a compliance; and perhaps he was in the right;\r\nfor the poor Irishman no sooner saw these noble peers had undertaken\r\nthe cause of his wife than he submitted, and articles of separation\r\nwere soon drawn up and signed between the parties.\r\n\r\nFitzpatrick, who had been so well satisfied by Mrs Waters concerning\r\nthe innocence of his wife with Jones at Upton, or perhaps, from some\r\nother reasons, was now become so indifferent to that matter, that he\r\nspoke highly in favour of Jones to Lord Fellamar, took all the blame\r\nupon himself, and said the other had behaved very much like a\r\ngentleman and a man of honour; and upon that lord's further enquiry\r\nconcerning Mr Jones, Fitzpatrick told him he was nephew to a gentleman\r\nof very great fashion and fortune, which was the account he had just\r\nreceived from Mrs Waters after her interview with Dowling.\r\n\r\nLord Fellamar now thought it behoved him to do everything in his power\r\nto make satisfaction to a gentleman whom he had so grossly injured,\r\nand without any consideration of rivalship (for he had now given over\r\nall thoughts of Sophia), determined to procure Mr Jones's liberty,\r\nbeing satisfied, as well from Fitzpatrick as his surgeon, that the\r\nwound was not mortal. He therefore prevailed with the Irish peer to\r\naccompany him to the place where Jones was confined, to whom he\r\nbehaved as we have already related.\r\n\r\nWhen Allworthy returned to his lodgings, he immediately carried Jones\r\ninto his room, and then acquainted him with the whole matter, as well\r\nwhat he had heard from Mrs Waters as what he had discovered from Mr\r\nDowling.\r\n\r\nJones expressed great astonishment and no less concern at this\r\naccount, but without making any comment or observation upon it. And\r\nnow a message was brought from Mr Blifil, desiring to know if his\r\nuncle was at leisure that he might wait upon him. Allworthy started\r\nand turned pale, and then in a more passionate tone than I believe he\r\nhad ever used before, bid the servant tell Blifil he knew him not.\r\n“Consider, dear sir,” cries Jones, in a trembling voice. “I have\r\nconsidered,” answered Allworthy, “and you yourself shall carry my\r\nmessage to the villain. No one can carry him the sentence of his own\r\nruin so properly as the man whose ruin he hath so villanously\r\ncontrived.” “Pardon me, dear sir,” said Jones; “a moment's reflection\r\nwill, I am sure, convince you of the contrary. What might perhaps be\r\nbut justice from another tongue, would from mine be insult; and to\r\nwhom?--my own brother and your nephew. Nor did he use me so\r\nbarbarously--indeed, that would have been more inexcusable than\r\nanything he hath done. Fortune may tempt men of no very bad\r\ndispositions to injustice; but insults proceed only from black and\r\nrancorous minds, and have no temptations to excuse them. Let me\r\nbeseech you, sir, to do nothing by him in the present height of your\r\nanger. Consider, my dear uncle, I was not myself condemned unheard.”\r\n Allworthy stood silent a moment, and then, embracing Jones, he said,\r\nwith tears gushing from his eyes, “O my child! to what goodness have I\r\nbeen so long blind!”\r\n\r\nMrs Miller entering the room at that moment, after a gentle rap which\r\nwas not perceived, and seeing Jones in the arms of his uncle, the poor\r\nwoman in an agony of joy fell upon her knees, and burst forth into the\r\nmost ecstatic thanksgivings to heaven for what had happened; then,\r\nrunning to Jones, she embraced him eagerly, crying, “My dearest\r\nfriend, I wish you joy a thousand and a thousand times of this blest\r\nday.” And next Mr Allworthy himself received the same congratulations.\r\nTo which he answered, “Indeed, indeed, Mrs Miller, I am beyond\r\nexpression happy.” Some few more raptures having passed on all sides,\r\nMrs Miller desired them both to walk down to dinner in the parlour,\r\nwhere she said there were a very happy set of people assembled--being\r\nindeed no other than Mr Nightingale and his bride, and his cousin\r\nHarriet with her bridegroom.\r\n\r\nAllworthy excused himself from dining with the company, saying he had\r\nordered some little thing for him and his nephew in his own apartment,\r\nfor that they had much private business to discourse of; but would not\r\nresist promising the good woman that both he and Jones would make part\r\nof her society at supper.\r\n\r\nMrs Miller then asked what was to be done with Blifil? “for indeed,”\r\n says she, “I cannot be easy while such a villain is in my\r\nhouse.”--Allworthy answered, “He was as uneasy as herself on the same\r\naccount.” “Oh!” cries she, “if that be the case, leave the matter to\r\nme, I'll soon show him the outside out of my doors, I warrant you.\r\nHere are two or three lusty fellows below-stairs.” “There will be no\r\nneed of any violence,” cries Allworthy; “if you will carry him a\r\nmessage from me, he will, I am convinced, depart of his own accord.”\r\n “Will I?” said Mrs Miller; “I never did anything in my life with a\r\nbetter will.” Here Jones interfered, and said, “He had considered the\r\nmatter better, and would, if Mr Allworthy pleased, be himself the\r\nmessenger. I know,” says he, “already enough of your pleasure, sir,\r\nand I beg leave to acquaint him with it by my own words. Let me\r\nbeseech you, sir,” added he, “to reflect on the dreadful consequences\r\nof driving him to violent and sudden despair. How unfit, alas! is this\r\npoor man to die in his present situation.” This suggestion had not the\r\nleast effect on Mrs Miller. She left the room, crying, “You are too\r\ngood, Mr Jones, infinitely too good to live in this world.” But it\r\nmade a deeper impression on Allworthy. “My good child,” said he, “I am\r\nequally astonished at the goodness of your heart, and the quickness of\r\nyour understanding. Heaven indeed forbid that this wretch should be\r\ndeprived of any means or time for repentance! That would be a shocking\r\nconsideration indeed. Go to him, therefore, and use your own\r\ndiscretion; yet do not flatter him with any hopes of my forgiveness;\r\nfor I shall never forgive villany farther than my religion obliges me,\r\nand that extends not either to our bounty or our conversation.”\r\n\r\nJones went up to Blifil's room, whom he found in a situation which\r\nmoved his pity, though it would have raised a less amiable passion in\r\nmany beholders. He cast himself on his bed, where he lay abandoning\r\nhimself to despair, and drowned in tears; not in such tears as flow\r\nfrom contrition, and wash away guilt from minds which have been\r\nseduced or surprized into it unawares, against the bent of their\r\nnatural dispositions, as will sometimes happen from human frailty,\r\neven to the good; no, these tears were such as the frighted thief\r\nsheds in his cart, and are indeed the effects of that concern which\r\nthe most savage natures are seldom deficient in feeling for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIt would be unpleasant and tedious to paint this scene in full length.\r\nLet it suffice to say, that the behaviour of Jones was kind to excess.\r\nHe omitted nothing which his invention could supply, to raise and\r\ncomfort the drooping spirits of Blifil, before he communicated to him\r\nthe resolution of his uncle that he must quit the house that evening.\r\nHe offered to furnish him with any money he wanted, assured him of his\r\nhearty forgiveness of all he had done against him, that he would\r\nendeavour to live with him hereafter as a brother, and would leave\r\nnothing unattempted to effectuate a reconciliation with his uncle.\r\n\r\nBlifil was at first sullen and silent, balancing in his mind whether\r\nhe should yet deny all; but, finding at last the evidence too strong\r\nagainst him, he betook himself at last to confession. He then asked\r\npardon of his brother in the most vehement manner, prostrated himself\r\non the ground, and kissed his feet; in short he was now as remarkably\r\nmean as he had been before remarkably wicked.\r\n\r\nJones could not so far check his disdain, but that it a little\r\ndiscovered itself in his countenance at this extreme servility. He\r\nraised his brother the moment he could from the ground, and advised\r\nhim to bear his afflictions more like a man; repeating, at the same\r\ntime, his promises, that he would do all in his power to lessen them;\r\nfor which Blifil, making many professions of his unworthiness, poured\r\nforth a profusion of thanks; and then, he having declared he would\r\nimmediately depart to another lodging, Jones returned to his uncle.\r\n\r\nAmong other matters, Allworthy now acquainted Jones with the discovery\r\nwhich he had made concerning the £500 bank-notes. “I have,” said he,\r\n“already consulted a lawyer, who tells me, to my great astonishment,\r\nthat there is no punishment for a fraud of this kind. Indeed, when I\r\nconsider the black ingratitude of this fellow toward you, I think a\r\nhighwayman, compared to him, is an innocent person.”\r\n\r\n“Good Heaven!” says Jones, “is it possible?--I am shocked beyond\r\nmeasure at this news. I thought there was not an honester fellow in\r\nthe world.----The temptation of such a sum was too great for him to\r\nwithstand; for smaller matters have come safe to me through his hand.\r\nIndeed, my dear uncle, you must suffer me to call it weakness rather\r\nthan ingratitude; for I am convinced the poor fellow loves me, and\r\nhath done me some kindnesses, which I can never forget; nay, I believe\r\nhe hath repented of this very act; for it is not above a day or two\r\nago, when my affairs seemed in the most desperate situation, that he\r\nvisited me in my confinement, and offered me any money I wanted.\r\nConsider, sir, what a temptation to a man who hath tasted such bitter\r\ndistress, it must be, to have a sum in his possession which must put\r\nhim and his family beyond any future possibility of suffering the\r\nlike.”\r\n\r\n“Child,” cries Allworthy, “you carry this forgiving temper too far.\r\nSuch mistaken mercy is not only weakness, but borders on injustice,\r\nand is very pernicious to society, as it encourages vice. The\r\ndishonesty of this fellow I might, perhaps, have pardoned, but never\r\nhis ingratitude. And give me leave to say, when we suffer any\r\ntemptation to atone for dishonesty itself, we are as candid and\r\nmerciful as we ought to be; and so far I confess I have gone; for I\r\nhave often pitied the fate of a highwayman, when I have been on the\r\ngrand jury; and have more than once applied to the judge on the behalf\r\nof such as have had any mitigating circumstances in their case; but\r\nwhen dishonesty is attended with any blacker crime, such as cruelty,\r\nmurder, ingratitude, or the like, compassion and forgiveness then\r\nbecome faults. I am convinced the fellow is a villain, and he shall be\r\npunished; at least as far as I can punish him.”\r\n\r\nThis was spoken with so stern a voice, that Jones did not think proper\r\nto make any reply; besides, the hour appointed by Mr Western now drew\r\nso near, that he had barely time left to dress himself. Here therefore\r\nended the present dialogue, and Jones retired to another room, where\r\nPartridge attended, according to order, with his cloaths.\r\n\r\nPartridge had scarce seen his master since the happy discovery. The\r\npoor fellow was unable either to contain or express his transports. He\r\nbehaved like one frantic, and made almost as many mistakes while he\r\nwas dressing Jones as I have seen made by Harlequin in dressing\r\nhimself on the stage.\r\n\r\nHis memory, however, was not in the least deficient. He recollected\r\nnow many omens and presages of this happy event, some of which he had\r\nremarked at the time, but many more he now remembered; nor did he omit\r\nthe dreams he had dreamt the evening before his meeting with Jones;\r\nand concluded with saying, “I always told your honour something boded\r\nin my mind that you would one time or other have it in your power to\r\nmake my fortune.” Jones assured him that this boding should as\r\ncertainly be verified with regard to him as all the other omens had\r\nbeen to himself; which did not a little add to all the raptures which\r\nthe poor fellow had already conceived on account of his master."

      "content": "Approaching still nearer to the end.\r\n\nJones, being now completely dressed, attended his uncle to Mr\r\nWestern's. He was, indeed, one of the finest figures ever beheld, and\r\nhis person alone would have charmed the greater part of womankind; but\r\nwe hope it hath already appeared in this history that Nature, when she\r\nformed him, did not totally rely, as she sometimes doth, on this merit\r\nonly, to recommend her work.\r\n\r\nSophia, who, angry as she was, was likewise set forth to the best\r\nadvantage, for which I leave my female readers to account, appeared so\r\nextremely beautiful, that even Allworthy, when he saw her, could not\r\nforbear whispering Western, that he believed she was the finest\r\ncreature in the world. To which Western answered, in a whisper,\r\noverheard by all present, “So much the better for Tom;--for d--n me if\r\nhe shan't ha the tousling her.” Sophia was all over scarlet at these\r\nwords, while Tom's countenance was altogether as pale, and he was\r\nalmost ready to sink from his chair.\r\n\r\nThe tea-table was scarce removed before Western lugged Allworthy out\r\nof the room, telling him he had business of consequence to impart, and\r\nmust speak to him that instant in private, before he forgot it.\r\n\r\nThe lovers were now alone, and it will, I question not, appear strange\r\nto many readers, that those who had so much to say to one another when\r\ndanger and difficulty attended their conversation, and who seemed so\r\neager to rush into each other's arms when so many bars lay in their\r\nway, now that with safety they were at liberty to say or do whatever\r\nthey pleased, should both remain for some time silent and motionless;\r\ninsomuch that a stranger of moderate sagacity might have well\r\nconcluded they were mutually indifferent; but so it was, however\r\nstrange it may seem; both sat with their eyes cast downwards on the\r\nground, and for some minutes continued in perfect silence.\r\n\r\nMr Jones during this interval attempted once or twice to speak, but\r\nwas absolutely incapable, muttering only, or rather sighing out, some\r\nbroken words; when Sophia at length, partly out of pity to him, and\r\npartly to turn the discourse from the subject which she knew well\r\nenough he was endeavouring to open, said--\r\n\r\n“Sure, sir, you are the most fortunate man in the world in this\r\ndiscovery.” “And can you really, madam, think me so fortunate,” said\r\nJones, sighing, “while I have incurred your displeasure?”--“Nay, sir,”\r\n says she, “as to that you best know whether you have deserved it.”\r\n “Indeed, madam,” answered he, “you yourself are as well apprized of\r\nall my demerits. Mrs Miller hath acquainted you with the whole truth.\r\nO! my Sophia, am I never to hope for forgiveness?”--“I think, Mr\r\nJones,” said she, “I may almost depend on your own justice, and leave\r\nit to yourself to pass sentence on your own conduct.”--“Alas! madam,”\r\n answered he, “it is mercy, and not justice, which I implore at your\r\nhands. Justice I know must condemn me.--Yet not for the letter I sent\r\nto Lady Bellaston. Of that I most solemnly declare you have had a true\r\naccount.” He then insisted much on the security given him by\r\nNightingale of a fair pretence for breaking off, if, contrary to their\r\nexpectations, her ladyship should have accepted his offer; but confest\r\nthat he had been guilty of a great indiscretion to put such a letter\r\nas that into her power, “which,” said he, “I have dearly paid for, in\r\nthe effect it has upon you.” “I do not, I cannot,” says she, “believe\r\notherwise of that letter than you would have me. My conduct, I think,\r\nshews you clearly I do not believe there is much in that. And yet, Mr\r\nJones, have I not enough to resent? After what past at Upton, so soon\r\nto engage in a new amour with another woman, while I fancied, and you\r\npretended, your heart was bleeding for me? Indeed, you have acted\r\nstrangely. Can I believe the passion you have profest to me to be\r\nsincere? Or, if I can, what happiness can I assure myself of with a\r\nman capable of so much inconstancy?” “O! my Sophia,” cries he, “do not\r\ndoubt the sincerity of the purest passion that ever inflamed a human\r\nbreast. Think, most adorable creature, of my unhappy situation, of my\r\ndespair. Could I, my Sophia, have flattered myself with the most\r\ndistant hopes of being ever permitted to throw myself at your feet in\r\nthe manner I do now, it would not have been in the power of any other\r\nwoman to have inspired a thought which the severest chastity could\r\nhave condemned. Inconstancy to you! O Sophia! if you can have goodness\r\nenough to pardon what is past, do not let any cruel future\r\napprehensions shut your mercy against me. No repentance was ever more\r\nsincere. O! let it reconcile me to my heaven in this dear bosom.”\r\n “Sincere repentance, Mr Jones,” answered she, “will obtain the pardon\r\nof a sinner, but it is from one who is a perfect judge of that\r\nsincerity. A human mind may be imposed on; nor is there any infallible\r\nmethod to prevent it. You must expect, however, that if I can be\r\nprevailed on by your repentance to pardon you, I will at least insist\r\non the strongest proof of its sincerity.” “Name any proof in my\r\npower,” answered Jones eagerly. “Time,” replied she; “time alone, Mr\r\nJones, can convince me that you are a true penitent, and have resolved\r\nto abandon these vicious courses, which I should detest you for, if I\r\nimagined you capable of persevering in them.” “Do not imagine it,”\r\n cries Jones. “On my knees I intreat, I implore your confidence, a\r\nconfidence which it shall be the business of my life to deserve.” “Let\r\nit then,” said she, “be the business of some part of your life to shew\r\nme you deserve it. I think I have been explicit enough in assuring\r\nyou, that, when I see you merit my confidence, you will obtain it.\r\nAfter what is past, sir, can you expect I should take you upon your\r\nword?”\r\n\r\nHe replied, “Don't believe me upon my word; I have a better security,\r\na pledge for my constancy, which it is impossible to see and to\r\ndoubt.” “What is that?” said Sophia, a little surprized. “I will show\r\nyou, my charming angel,” cried Jones, seizing her hand and carrying\r\nher to the glass. “There, behold it there in that lovely figure, in\r\nthat face, that shape, those eyes, that mind which shines through\r\nthese eyes; can the man who shall be in possession of these be\r\ninconstant? Impossible! my Sophia; they would fix a Dorimant, a Lord\r\nRochester. You could not doubt it, if you could see yourself with any\r\neyes but your own.” Sophia blushed and half smiled; but, forcing\r\nagain her brow into a frown--“If I am to judge,” said she, “of the\r\nfuture by the past, my image will no more remain in your heart when I\r\nam out of your sight, than it will in this glass when I am out of the\r\nroom.” “By heaven, by all that is sacred!” said Jones, “it never was\r\nout of my heart. The delicacy of your sex cannot conceive the\r\ngrossness of ours, nor how little one sort of amour has to do with\r\nthe heart.” “I will never marry a man,” replied Sophia, very gravely,\r\n“who shall not learn refinement enough to be as incapable as I am\r\nmyself of making such a distinction.” “I will learn it,” said Jones.\r\n“I have learnt it already. The first moment of hope that my Sophia\r\nmight be my wife taught it me at once; and all the rest of her sex\r\nfrom that moment became as little the objects of desire to my sense\r\nas of passion to my heart.” “Well,” says Sophia, “the proof of this\r\nmust be from time. Your situation, Mr Jones, is now altered, and I\r\nassure you I have great satisfaction in the alteration. You will now\r\nwant no opportunity of being near me, and convincing me that your\r\nmind is altered too.” “O! my angel,” cries Jones, “how shall I thank\r\nthy goodness! And are you so good to own that you have a satisfaction\r\nin my prosperity?----Believe me, believe me, madam, it is you alone\r\nhave given a relish to that prosperity, since I owe to it the dear\r\nhope----O! my Sophia, let it not be a distant one.--I will be all\r\nobedience to your commands. I will not dare to press anything further\r\nthan you permit me. Yet let me intreat you to appoint a short trial.\r\nO! tell me when I may expect you will be convinced of what is most\r\nsolemnly true.” “When I have gone voluntarily thus far, Mr Jones,”\r\n said she, “I expect not to be pressed. Nay, I will not.”--“O! don't\r\nlook unkindly thus, my Sophia,” cries he. “I do not, I dare not press\r\nyou.--Yet permit me at least once more to beg you would fix the\r\nperiod. O! consider the impatience of love.”--“A twelvemonth,\r\nperhaps,” said she. “O! my Sophia,” cries he, “you have named an\r\neternity.”--“Perhaps it may be something sooner,” says she; “I will\r\nnot be teazed. If your passion for me be what I would have it, I\r\nthink you may now be easy.”--“Easy! Sophia, call not such an exulting\r\nhappiness as mine by so cold a name.----O! transporting thought! am I\r\nnot assured that the blessed day will come, when I shall call you\r\nmine; when fears shall be no more; when I shall have that dear, that\r\nvast, that exquisite, ecstatic delight of making my Sophia\r\nhappy?”--“Indeed, sir,” said she, “that day is in your own\r\npower.”--“O! my dear, my divine angel,” cried he, “these words have\r\nmade me mad with joy.----But I must, I will thank those dear lips\r\nwhich have so sweetly pronounced my bliss.” He then caught her in his\r\narms, and kissed her with an ardour he had never ventured before.\r\n\r\nAt this instant Western, who had stood some time listening, burst into\r\nthe room, and, with his hunting voice and phrase, cried out, “To her,\r\nboy, to her, go to her.----That's it, little honeys, O that's it!\r\nWell! what, is it all over? Hath she appointed the day, boy? What,\r\nshall it be to-morrow or next day? It shan't be put off a minute\r\nlonger than next day, I am resolved.” “Let me beseech you, sir,” says\r\nJones, “don't let me be the occasion”----“Beseech mine a----,” cries\r\nWestern. “I thought thou hadst been a lad of higher mettle than to\r\ngive way to a parcel of maidenish tricks.----I tell thee 'tis all\r\nflimflam. Zoodikers! she'd have the wedding to-night with all her\r\nheart. Would'st not, Sophy? Come, confess, and be an honest girl for\r\nonce. What, art dumb? Why dost not speak?” “Why should I confess,\r\nsir,” says Sophia, “since it seems you are so well acquainted with my\r\nthoughts?”----“That's a good girl,” cries he, “and dost consent then?”\r\n “No, indeed, sir,” says Sophia, “I have given no such consent.”---“And\r\nwunt not ha un then to-morrow, nor next day?” says Western.--“Indeed,\r\nsir,” says she, “I have no such intention.” “But I can tell thee,”\r\n replied he, “why hast nut; only because thou dost love to be\r\ndisobedient, and to plague and vex thy father.” “Pray, sir,” said\r\nJones, interfering----“I tell thee thou art a puppy,” cries he. “When\r\nI vorbid her, then it was all nothing but sighing and whining, and\r\nlanguishing and writing; now I am vor thee, she is against thee. All\r\nthe spirit of contrary, that's all. She is above being guided and\r\ngoverned by her father, that is the whole truth on't. It is only to\r\ndisoblige and contradict me.” “What would my papa have me do?” cries\r\nSophia. “What would I ha thee do?” says he, “why, gi' un thy hand this\r\nmoment.”--“Well, sir,” says Sophia, “I will obey you.--There is my\r\nhand, Mr Jones.” “Well, and will you consent to ha un to-morrow\r\nmorning?” says Western.--“I will be obedient to you, sir,” cries\r\nshe.--“Why then to-morrow morning be the day,” cries he. “Why then\r\nto-morrow morning shall be the day, papa, since you will have it so,”\r\n says Sophia. Jones then fell upon his knees, and kissed her hand in an\r\nagony of joy, while Western began to caper and dance about the room,\r\npresently crying out--“Where the devil is Allworthy? He is without\r\nnow, a talking with that d--d lawyer Dowling, when he should be\r\nminding other matters.” He then sallied out in quest of him, and very\r\nopportunely left the lovers to enjoy a few tender minutes alone.\r\n\r\nBut he soon returned with Allworthy, saying, “If you won't believe me,\r\nyou may ask her yourself. Hast nut gin thy consent, Sophy, to be\r\nmarried to-morrow?” “Such are your commands, sir,” cries Sophia, “and\r\nI dare not be guilty of disobedience.” “I hope, madam,” cries\r\nAllworthy, “my nephew will merit so much goodness, and will be always\r\nas sensible as myself of the great honour you have done my family. An\r\nalliance with so charming and so excellent a young lady would indeed\r\nbe an honour to the greatest in England.” “Yes,” cries Western, “but\r\nif I had suffered her to stand shill I shall I, dilly dally, you might\r\nnot have had that honour yet a while; I was forced to use a little\r\nfatherly authority to bring her to.” “I hope not, sir,” cries\r\nAllworthy, “I hope there is not the least constraint.” “Why, there,”\r\n cries Western, “you may bid her unsay all again if you will. Dost\r\nrepent heartily of thy promise, dost not, Sophia?” “Indeed, papa,”\r\n cries she, “I do not repent, nor do I believe I ever shall, of any\r\npromise in favour of Mr Jones.” “Then, nephew,” cries Allworthy, “I\r\nfelicitate you most heartily; for I think you are the happiest of men.\r\nAnd, madam, you will give me leave to congratulate you on this joyful\r\noccasion: indeed, I am convinced you have bestowed yourself on one who\r\nwill be sensible of your great merit, and who will at least use his\r\nbest endeavours to deserve it.” “His best endeavours!” cries Western,\r\n“that he will, I warrant un.----Harkee, Allworthy, I'll bet thee five\r\npounds to a crown we have a boy to-morrow nine months; but prithee\r\ntell me what wut ha! Wut ha Burgundy, Champaigne, or what? for, please\r\nJupiter, we'll make a night on't.” “Indeed, sir,” said Allworthy, “you\r\nmust excuse me; both my nephew and I were engaged before I suspected\r\nthis near approach of his happiness.”--“Engaged!” quoth the squire,\r\n“never tell me.--I won't part with thee to-night upon any occasion.\r\nShalt sup here, please the lord Harry.” “You must pardon me, my dear\r\nneighbour!” answered Allworthy; “I have given a solemn promise, and\r\nthat you know I never break.” “Why, prithee, who art engaged to?”\r\n cries the squire.----Allworthy then informed him, as likewise of the\r\ncompany.----“Odzookers!” answered the squire, “I will go with thee,\r\nand so shall Sophy! for I won't part with thee to-night; and it would\r\nbe barbarous to part Tom and the girl.” This offer was presently\r\nembraced by Allworthy, and Sophia consented, having first obtained a\r\nprivate promise from her father that he would not mention a syllable\r\nconcerning her marriage.\r\n\nChapter the last.\r\n\r\nIn which the history is concluded.\r\n\nYoung Nightingale had been that afternoon, by appointment, to wait on\r\nhis father, who received him much more kindly than he expected. There\r\nlikewise he met his uncle, who was returned to town in quest of his\r\nnew-married daughter.\r\n\r\nThis marriage was the luckiest incident which could have happened to\r\nthe young gentleman; for these brothers lived in a constant state of\r\ncontention about the government of their children, both heartily\r\ndespising the method which each other took. Each of them therefore now\r\nendeavoured, as much as he could, to palliate the offence which his\r\nown child had committed, and to aggravate the match of the other. This\r\ndesire of triumphing over his brother, added to the many arguments\r\nwhich Allworthy had used, so strongly operated on the old gentleman\r\nthat he met his son with a smiling countenance, and actually agreed to\r\nsup with him that evening at Mrs Miller's.\r\n\r\nAs for the other, who really loved his daughter with the most\r\nimmoderate affection, there was little difficulty in inclining him to\r\na reconciliation. He was no sooner informed by his nephew where his\r\ndaughter and her husband were, than he declared he would instantly go\r\nto her. And when he arrived there he scarce suffered her to fall upon\r\nher knees before he took her up, and embraced her with a tenderness\r\nwhich affected all who saw him; and in less than a quarter of an hour\r\nwas as well reconciled to both her and her husband as if he had\r\nhimself joined their hands.\r\n\r\nIn this situation were affairs when Mr Allworthy and his company\r\narrived to complete the happiness of Mrs Miller, who no sooner saw\r\nSophia than she guessed everything that had happened; and so great was\r\nher friendship to Jones, that it added not a few transports to those\r\nshe felt on the happiness of her own daughter.\r\n\r\nThere have not, I believe, been many instances of a number of people\r\nmet together, where every one was so perfectly happy as in this\r\ncompany. Amongst whom the father of young Nightingale enjoyed the\r\nleast perfect content; for, notwithstanding his affection for his son,\r\nnotwithstanding the authority and the arguments of Allworthy, together\r\nwith the other motive mentioned before, he could not so entirely be\r\nsatisfied with his son's choice; and, perhaps, the presence of Sophia\r\nherself tended a little to aggravate and heighten his concern, as a\r\nthought now and then suggested itself that his son might have had that\r\nlady, or some other such. Not that any of the charms which adorned\r\neither the person or mind of Sophia created the uneasiness; it was the\r\ncontents of her father's coffers which set his heart a longing. These\r\nwere the charms which he could not bear to think his son had\r\nsacrificed to the daughter of Mrs Miller.\r\n\r\nThe brides were both very pretty women; but so totally were they\r\neclipsed by the beauty of Sophia, that, had they not been two of the\r\nbest-tempered girls in the world, it would have raised some envy in\r\ntheir breasts; for neither of their husbands could long keep his eyes\r\nfrom Sophia, who sat at the table like a queen receiving homage, or,\r\nrather, like a superior being receiving adoration from all around her.\r\nBut it was an adoration which they gave, not which she exacted; for\r\nshe was as much distinguished by her modesty and affability as by all\r\nher other perfections.\r\n\r\nThe evening was spent in much true mirth. All were happy, but those\r\nthe most who had been most unhappy before. Their former sufferings and\r\nfears gave such a relish to their felicity as even love and fortune,\r\nin their fullest flow, could not have given without the advantage of\r\nsuch a comparison. Yet, as great joy, especially after a sudden change\r\nand revolution of circumstances, is apt to be silent, and dwells\r\nrather in the heart than on the tongue, Jones and Sophia appeared the\r\nleast merry of the whole company; which Western observed with great\r\nimpatience, often crying out to them, “Why dost not talk, boy? Why\r\ndost look so grave? Hast lost thy tongue, girl? Drink another glass of\r\nwine; sha't drink another glass.” And, the more to enliven her, he\r\nwould sometimes sing a merry song, which bore some relation to\r\nmatrimony and the loss of a maidenhead. Nay, he would have proceeded\r\nso far on that topic as to have driven her out of the room, if Mr\r\nAllworthy had not checkt him, sometimes by looks, and once or twice by\r\na “Fie! Mr Western!” He began, indeed, once to debate the matter, and\r\nassert his right to talk to his own daughter as he thought fit; but,\r\nas nobody seconded him, he was soon reduced to order.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this little restraint, he was so pleased with the\r\nchearfulness and good-humour of the company, that he insisted on their\r\nmeeting the next day at his lodgings. They all did so; and the lovely\r\nSophia, who was now in private become a bride too, officiated as the\r\nmistress of the ceremonies, or, in the polite phrase, did the honours\r\nof the table. She had that morning given her hand to Jones, in the\r\nchapel at Doctors'-Commons, where Mr Allworthy, Mr Western, and Mrs\r\nMiller, were the only persons present.\r\n\r\nSophia had earnestly desired her father that no others of the company,\r\nwho were that day to dine with him, should be acquainted with her\r\nmarriage. The same secrecy was enjoined to Mrs Miller, and Jones\r\nundertook for Allworthy. This somewhat reconciled the delicacy of\r\nSophia to the public entertainment which, in compliance with her\r\nfather's will, she was obliged to go to, greatly against her own\r\ninclinations. In confidence of this secrecy she went through the day\r\npretty well, till the squire, who was now advanced into the second\r\nbottle, could contain his joy no longer, but, filling out a bumper,\r\ndrank a health to the bride. The health was immediately pledged by all\r\npresent, to the great confusion of our poor blushing Sophia, and the\r\ngreat concern of Jones upon her account. To say truth, there was not a\r\nperson present made wiser by this discovery; for Mrs Miller had\r\nwhispered it to her daughter, her daughter to her husband, her husband\r\nto his sister, and she to all the rest.\r\n\r\nSophia now took the first opportunity of withdrawing with the ladies,\r\nand the squire sat in to his cups, in which he was, by degrees,\r\ndeserted by all the company except the uncle of young Nightingale, who\r\nloved his bottle as well as Western himself. These two, therefore, sat\r\nstoutly to it during the whole evening, and long after that happy hour\r\nwhich had surrendered the charming Sophia to the eager arms of her\r\nenraptured Jones.\r\n\r\nThus, reader, we have at length brought our history to a conclusion,\r\nin which, to our great pleasure, though contrary, perhaps, to thy\r\nexpectation, Mr Jones appears to be the happiest of all humankind; for\r\nwhat happiness this world affords equal to the possession of such a\r\nwoman as Sophia, I sincerely own I have never yet discovered.\r\n\r\nAs to the other persons who have made any considerable figure in this\r\nhistory, as some may desire to know a little more concerning them, we\r\nwill proceed, in as few words as possible, to satisfy their curiosity.\r\n\r\nAllworthy hath never yet been prevailed upon to see Blifil, but he\r\nhath yielded to the importunity of Jones, backed by Sophia, to settle\r\n£200 a-year upon him; to which Jones hath privately added a third.\r\nUpon this income he lives in one of the northern counties, about 200\r\nmiles distant from London, and lays up £200 a-year out of it, in order\r\nto purchase a seat in the next parliament from a neighbouring borough,\r\nwhich he has bargained for with an attourney there. He is also lately\r\nturned Methodist, in hopes of marrying a very rich widow of that sect,\r\nwhose estate lies in that part of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nSquare died soon after he writ the before-mentioned letter; and as to\r\nThwackum, he continues at his vicarage. He hath made many fruitless\r\nattempts to regain the confidence of Allworthy, or to ingratiate\r\nhimself with Jones, both of whom he flatters to their faces, and\r\nabuses behind their backs. But in his stead, Mr Allworthy hath lately\r\ntaken Mr Abraham Adams into his house, of whom Sophia is grown\r\nimmoderately fond, and declares he shall have the tuition of her\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nMrs Fitzpatrick is separated from her husband, and retains the little\r\nremains of her fortune. She lives in reputation at the polite end of\r\nthe town, and is so good an economist, that she spends three times\r\nthe income of her fortune, without running into debt. She maintains a\r\nperfect intimacy with the lady of the Irish peer; and in acts of\r\nfriendship to her repays all obligations she owes her husband.\r\n\r\nMrs Western was soon reconciled to her niece Sophia, and hath spent\r\ntwo months together with her in the country. Lady Bellaston made the\r\nlatter a formal visit at her return to town, where she behaved to\r\nJones as a perfect stranger, and, with great civility, wished him joy\r\non his marriage.\r\n\r\nMr Nightingale hath purchased an estate for his son in the\r\nneighbourhood of Jones, where the young gentleman, his lady, Mrs\r\nMiller, and her little daughter reside, and the most agreeable\r\nintercourse subsists between the two families.\r\n\r\nAs to those of lower account, Mrs Waters returned into the country,\r\nhad a pension of £60 a-year settled upon her by Mr Allworthy, and is\r\nmarried to Parson Supple, on whom, at the instance of Sophia, Western\r\nhath bestowed a considerable living.\r\n\r\nBlack George, hearing the discovery that had been made, ran away, and\r\nwas never since heard of; and Jones bestowed the money on his family,\r\nbut not in equal proportions, for Molly had much the greatest share.\r\n\r\nAs for Partridge, Jones hath settled £50 a-year on him; and he hath\r\nagain set up a school, in which he meets with much better\r\nencouragement than formerly, and there is now a treaty of marriage on\r\nfoot between him and Miss Molly Seagrim, which, through the mediation\r\nof Sophia, is likely to take effect.\r\n\r\nWe now return to take leave of Mr Jones and Sophia, who, within two\r\ndays after their marriage, attended Mr Western and Mr Allworthy into\r\nthe country. Western hath resigned his family seat, and the greater\r\npart of his estate, to his son-in-law, and hath retired to a lesser\r\nhouse of his in another part of the country, which is better for\r\nhunting. Indeed, he is often as a visitant with Mr Jones, who, as well\r\nas his daughter, hath an infinite delight in doing everything in their\r\npower to please him. And this desire of theirs is attended with such\r\nsuccess, that the old gentleman declares he was never happy in his\r\nlife till now. He hath here a parlour and ante-chamber to himself,\r\nwhere he gets drunk with whom he pleases: and his daughter is still as\r\nready as formerly to play to him whenever he desires it; for Jones\r\nhath assured her that, as, next to pleasing her, one of his highest\r\nsatisfactions is to contribute to the happiness of the old man; so,\r\nthe great duty which she expresses and performs to her father, renders\r\nher almost equally dear to him with the love which she bestows on\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nSophia hath already produced him two fine children, a boy and a girl,\r\nof whom the old gentleman is so fond, that he spends much of his time\r\nin the nursery, where he declares the tattling of his little\r\ngrand-daughter, who is above a year and a half old, is sweeter music\r\nthan the finest cry of dogs in England.\r\n\r\nAllworthy was likewise greatly liberal to Jones on the marriage, and\r\nhath omitted no instance of shewing his affection to him and his lady,\r\nwho love him as a father. Whatever in the nature of Jones had a\r\ntendency to vice, has been corrected by continual conversation with\r\nthis good man, and by his union with the lovely and virtuous Sophia.\r\nHe hath also, by reflection on his past follies, acquired a discretion\r\nand prudence very uncommon in one of his lively parts.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, as there are not to be found a worthier man and woman,\r\nthan this fond couple, so neither can any be imagined more happy. They\r\npreserve the purest and tenderest affection for each other, an\r\naffection daily encreased and confirmed by mutual endearments and\r\nmutual esteem. Nor is their conduct towards their relations and\r\nfriends less amiable than towards one another. And such is their\r\ncondescension, their indulgence, and their beneficence to those below\r\nthem, that there is not a neighbour, a tenant, or a servant, who doth\r\nnot most gratefully bless the day when Mr Jones was married to his\r\nSophia.\r\n\n_FINIS_."
