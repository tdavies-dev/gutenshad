Besides, I have consulted\r\nMr Davy Higgins, an eminent attorney of this place, who, after due\r\ninspection and consideration, declareth, That he doth not think the said\r\nLetters contain any matter which will be held actionable in the eye of\r\nthe law. Finally, if you and I should come to a right understanding, I\r\ndo declare in verbo sacerdotis, that, in case of any such prosecution,\r\nI will take the whole upon my own shoulders, even quoad fine and\r\nimprisonment, though, I must confess, I should not care to undergo\r\nflagellation: Tam ad turpitudinem, quam ad amaritudinem poenoe\r\nspectans--Secondly, concerning the personal resentment of Mr Justice\r\nLismahago, I may say, non flocci facio--I would not willingly vilipend\r\nany Christian, if, peradventure, he deserveth that epithet: albeit, I\r\nam much surprised that more care is not taken to exclude from the\r\ncommission all such vagrant foreigners as may be justly suspected of\r\ndisaffection to our happy constitution, in church and state--God forbid\r\nthat I should be so uncharitable, as to affirm, positively, that the\r\nsaid Lismahago is no better than a Jesuit in disguise; but this I will\r\nassert and maintain, totis viribus, that, from the day he qualified, he\r\nhas never been once seen intra templi parietes, that is to say, within\r\nthe parish church.\r\n\r\nThirdly, with respect to what passed at Mr Kendal’s table, when the said\r\nLismahago was so brutal in his reprehensions, I must inform you, my good\r\nSir, that I was obliged to retire, not by fear arising from his minatory\r\nreproaches, which, as I said above, I value not of a rush; but from the\r\nsudden effect produced, by a barbel’s row, which I had eaten at\r\ndinner, not knowing, that the said row is at certain seasons violently\r\ncathartic, as Galen observeth in his chapter Peri ichtos.\r\n\r\nFourthly, and lastly, with reference to the manner in which I got\r\npossession of these Letters, it is a circumstance that concerns my own\r\nconscience only; sufficeth it to say, I have fully satisfied the parties\r\nin whose custody they were; and, by this time, I hope I have also\r\nsatisfied you in such ways, that the last hand may be put to our\r\nagreement, and the work proceed with all convenient expedition; in which\r\nI hope I rest,\r\n\r\nRespected Sir, Your very humble servant,\r\n\r\nJONATHAN DUSTWICH.\r\n\r\nP.S. I propose, Deo volente, to have the pleasure of seeing you in the\r\ngreat city, towards All-hallowtide, when I shall be glad to treat with\r\nyou concerning a parcel of MS. sermons, of a certain clergyman deceased;\r\na cake of the right leaven, for the present taste of the public. Verbum\r\nsapienti, &c.\r\n\r\nJ.D.\r\n\nTo the Revd. Mr JONATHAN DUSTWICH, at--\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI received yours in course of post, and shall be glad to treat with you\r\nfor the M.S. which I have delivered to your friend Mr Behn; but can\r\nby no means comply with the terms proposed. Those things are so\r\nuncertain--Writing is all a lottery--I have been a loser by the works\r\nof the greatest men of the age--I could mention particulars, and name\r\nnames; but don’t choose it--The taste of the town is so changeable.\r\nThen there have been so many letters upon travels lately published--What\r\nbetween Smollett’s, Sharp’s, Derrick’s, Thicknesse’s, Baltimore’s, and\r\nBaretti’s, together with Shandy’s Sentimental Travels, the public seems\r\nto be cloyed with that kind of entertainment--Nevertheless, I will,\r\nif you please, run the risque of printing and publishing, and you shall\r\nhave half the profits of the impression--You need not take the trouble\r\nto bring up your sermons on my account--No body reads sermons but\r\nMethodists and Dissenters--Besides, for my own part, I am quite a\r\nstranger to that sort of reading; and the two persons, whose judgment I\r\ndepended upon in those matters, are out of the way; one is gone abroad,\r\ncarpenter of a man of war; and the other, has been silly enough to\r\nabscond, in order to avoid a prosecution for blasphemy--I’m a great\r\nloser by his going off--He has left a manual of devotion half finished\r\non my hands, after having received money for the whole copy--He was the\r\nsoundest divine, and had the most orthodox pen of all my people; and I\r\nnever knew his judgment fail, but in flying from his bread and butter on\r\nthis occasion.\r\n\r\nBy owning you was not put in bodily fear by Lismahago, you preclude\r\nyourself from the benefit of a good plea, over and above the advantage\r\nof binding him over. In the late war, I inserted in my evening paper,\r\na paragraph that came by the post, reflecting upon the behaviour of a\r\ncertain regiment in battle. An officer of said regiment came to my shop,\r\nand, in the presence of my wife and journeyman, threatened to cut off\r\nmy ears--As I exhibited marks of bodily fear more ways than one, to the\r\nconviction of the byestanders, I bound him over; my action lay, and I\r\nrecovered. As for flagellation, you have nothing to fear, and nothing to\r\nhope, on that head--There has been but one printer flogged at the cart’s\r\ntail these thirty years; that was Charles Watson; and he assured me it\r\nwas no more than a flea-bite. C-- S-- has been threatened several times\r\nby the House of L--; but it came to nothing. If an information should\r\nbe moved for, and granted against you, as the editor of those Letters,\r\nI hope you will have honesty and wit enough to appear and take your\r\ntrial--If you should be sentenced to the pillory, your fortune is\r\nmade--As times go, that’s a sure step to honour and preferment. I shall\r\nthink myself happy if I can lend you a lift; and am, very sincerely,\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\nHENRY DAVIS. LONDON, Aug. 10th.\r\n\r\nPlease my kind service to your neighbour, my cousin Madoc--I have\r\nsent an Almanack and Court-kalendar, directed for him at Mr Sutton’s,\r\nbookseller, in Gloucester, carriage paid, which he will please to accept\r\nas a small token of my regard. My wife, who is very fond of toasted\r\ncheese, presents her compliments to him, and begs to know if there’s any\r\nof that kind, which he was so good as to send us last Christmas, to be\r\nsold in London.\r\n\r\nH. D.\r\n\nTHE EXPEDITION OF HUMPHRY CLINKER\r\n\nTo Dr LEWIS.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR,\r\n\r\nThe pills are good for nothing--I might as well swallow snowballs to\r\ncool my reins--I have told you over and over how hard I am to move; and\r\nat this time of day, I ought to know something of my own constitution.\r\nWhy will you be so positive? Prithee send me another prescription--I am\r\nas lame and as much tortured in all my limbs as if I was broke upon the\r\nwheel: indeed, I am equally distressed in mind and body--As if I had not\r\nplagues enough of my own, those children of my sister are left me for a\r\nperpetual source of vexation--what business have people to get children\r\nto plague their neighbours? A ridiculous incident that happened\r\nyesterday to my niece Liddy, has disordered me in such a manner, that\r\nI expect to be laid up with another fit of the gout--perhaps, I may\r\nexplain myself in my next. I shall set out tomorrow morning for the\r\nHot Well at Bristol, where I am afraid I shall stay longer than I could\r\nwish. On the receipt of this send Williams thither with my saddle-horse\r\nand the demi pique. Tell Barns to thresh out the two old ricks, and send\r\nthe corn to market, and sell it off to the poor at a shilling a bushel\r\nunder market price.--I have received a snivelling letter from Griffin,\r\noffering to make a public submission and pay costs. I want none of his\r\nsubmissions, neither will I pocket any of his money. The fellow is a bad\r\nneighbour, and I desire, to have nothing to do with him: but as he is\r\npurse-proud, he shall pay for his insolence: let him give five pounds to\r\nthe poor of the parish, and I will withdraw my action; and in the mean\r\ntime you may tell Prig to stop proceedings.--Let Morgan’s widow have the\r\nAlderney cow, and forty shillings to clothe her children: but don’t say\r\na syllable of the matter to any living soul--I’ll make her pay when she\r\nis able. I desire you will lock up all my drawers, and keep the keys\r\ntill meeting; and be sure you take the iron chest with my papers into\r\nyour own custody--Forgive all, this trouble from,\r\n\r\nDear Lewis, Your affectionate M. BRAMBLE GLOUCESTER, April 2.\r\n\nTo Mrs GWYLLIM, house-keeper at Brambleton-hall.\r\n\r\nMRS GWILLIM,\r\n\r\nWhen this cums to hand, be sure to pack up in the trunk male that stands\r\nin my closet; to be sent me in the Bristol waggon without loss of time,\r\nthe following articles, viz. my rose collard neglejay with green robins,\r\nmy yellow damask, and my black velvets with the short hoop; my bloo\r\nquilted petticot, my green mantel, my laced apron, my French commode,\r\nMacklin head and lappets and the litel box with my jowls. Williams may\r\nbring over my bum-daffee, and the viol with the easings of Dr Hill’s\r\ndockwater and Chowder’s lacksitif. The poor creature has been terribly\r\nstuprated ever since we left huom. Pray take particular care of the\r\nhouse while the family is absent. Let there be a fire constantly kept in\r\nmy brother’s chamber and mine. The maids, having nothing to do, may be\r\nsat a spinning. I desire you’ll clap a pad-luck on the wind-seller, and\r\nlet none of the men have excess to the strong bear--don’t forget to have\r\nthe gate shit every evening be dark--The gardnir and the hind may lie\r\nbelow in the landry, to partake the house, with the blunderbuss and the\r\ngreat dog; and hope you’ll have a watchful eye over the maids. I know\r\nthat hussy Mary Jones, loves to be rumping with the men. Let me know\r\nAlderney’s calf be sould yet, and what he fought--if the ould goose be\r\nsitting; and if the cobler has cut Dicky, and how pore anemil bore the\r\noperation. No more at present, but rests,\r\n\r\nYours, TABITHA BRAMBLE GLOSTAR, April 2.\r\n\nTO Mrs MARY JONES, at Brambleton-hall.\r\n\r\nDEAR MOLLY,\r\n\r\nHeaving this importunity, I send, my love to you and Saul, being in good\r\nhealth, and hoping to hear the same from you; and that you and Saul will\r\ntake my poor kitten to bed with you this cold weather. We have been all\r\nin, a sad taking here at Glostar--Miss Liddy had like to have run away\r\nwith a player-man, and young master and he would adone themselves a\r\nmischief; but the squire applied to the mare, and they were, bound\r\nover.--Mistress bid me not speak a word of the matter to any Christian\r\nsoul--no more I shall; for, we servints should see all and say nothing--\r\nBut what was worse than all this, Chowder has had the misfortune to be\r\nworried by a butcher’s dog, and came home in a terrible pickle--Mistress\r\nwas taken with the asterisks, but they soon went off. The doctor was\r\nsent for to Chowder, and he subscribed a repository which did him great\r\nservice--thank God he’s now in a fair way to do well--pray take care\r\nof my box and the pillyber and put them under your own bed; for, I do\r\nsuppose madam, Gwyllim will be a prying into my secrets, now my back is\r\nturned. John Thomas is in good health, but sulky. The squire gave away\r\nan ould coat to a poor man; and John says as, how ‘tis robbing him of\r\nhis perquisites.--I told him, by his agreement he was to receive\r\nno vails; but he says as how there’s a difference betwixt vails and\r\nperquisites; and so there is for sartain. We are all going to the Hot\r\nWell, where I shall drink your health in a glass of water, being,\r\n\r\nDear Molly, Your humble servant to command, W. JENKINS GLOSTAR, April\r\n2nd.\r\n\nTo Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bart. of Jesus college, Oxon.\r\n\r\nDEAR PHILLIPS,\r\n\r\nAs I have nothing more at heart than to convince you I am incapable of\r\nforgetting, or neglecting the friendship I made at college, now begin\r\nthat correspondence by letters, which you and I agreed, at parting, to\r\ncultivate. I begin it sooner than I intended, that you may have it in\r\nyour power to refute any idle reports which may be circulated to my\r\nprejudice at Oxford, touching a foolish quarrel, in which I have been\r\ninvolved on account of my sister, who had been some time settled here\r\nin a boarding-school. When I came hither with my uncle and aunt (who\r\nare our guardians) to fetch her away, I found her a fine tall girl, of\r\nseventeen, with an agreeable person; but remarkably simple, and quite\r\nignorant of the world. This disposition, and want of experience, had\r\nexposed her to the addresses of a person--I know not what to call\r\nhim, who had seen her at a play; and, with a confidence and dexterity\r\npeculiar to himself, found means to be recommended to her acquaintance.\r\nIt was by the greatest accident I intercepted one of his letters; as\r\nit was my duty to stifle this correspondence in its birth, I made it my\r\nbusiness to find him out, and tell him very freely my sentiments of\r\nthe matter. The spark did not like the stile I used, and behaved with\r\nabundance of mettle. Though his rank in life (which, by the bye, I am\r\nashamed to declare) did not entitle him to much deference; yet as his\r\nbehaviour was remarkably spirited, I admitted him to the privilege of\r\na gentleman, and something might have happened, had not we been\r\nprevented.--In short, the business took air, I know not how, and made\r\nabundance of noise--recourse was had to justice--I was obliged to give\r\nmy word and honour, &c. and to-morrow morning we set out for Bristol\r\nWells, where I expect to hear from you by the return of the post.--I\r\nhave got into a family of originals, whom I may one day attempt to\r\ndescribe for your amusement. My aunt, Mrs Tabitha Bramble, is a maiden\r\nof forty-five, exceedingly starched, vain, and ridiculous.--My uncle is\r\nan odd kind of humorist, always on the fret, and so unpleasant in his\r\nmanner, that rather than be obliged to keep him company, I’d resign all\r\nclaim to the inheritance of his estate. Indeed his being tortured by the\r\ngout may have soured his temper, and, perhaps, I may like him better on\r\nfurther acquaintance; certain it is, all his servants and neighbours in\r\nthe country are fond of him, even to a degree of enthusiasm, the reason\r\nof which I cannot as yet comprehend. Remember me to Griffy Price, Gwyn,\r\nMansel, Basset, and all the rest of my old Cambrian companions.--Salute\r\nthe bedmaker in my name--give my service to the cook, and pray take care\r\nof poor Ponto, for the sake of his old master, who is, and ever will be,\r\n\r\nDear Phillips, Your affectionate friend, and humble servant, JER.\r\nMELFORD GLOUCESTER, April 2.\r\n\nTo Mrs JERMYN at her house in Gloucester.\r\n\r\nDEAR MADAM,\r\n\r\nHaving no mother of my own, I hope you will give me leave to disburden\r\nmy poor heart to you, who have always acted the part of a kind parent to\r\nme, ever since I was put under your care. Indeed, and indeed, my worthy\r\ngoverness may believe me, when I assure her, that I never harboured\r\na thought that was otherwise than virtuous; and, if God will give me\r\ngrace, I shall never behave so as to cast a reflection on the care you\r\nhave taken in my education. I confess I have given just cause of offence\r\nby my want of prudence and experience. I ought not to have listened to\r\nwhat the young man said; and it was my duty to have told you all that\r\npassed, but I was ashamed to mention it; and then he behaved so modest\r\nand respectful, and seemed to be so melancholy and timorous, that\r\nI could not find in my heart to do any thing that should make him\r\nmiserable and desperate. As for familiarities, I do declare, I never\r\nonce allowed him the favour of a: salute; and as to the few letters that\r\npassed between us, they are all in my uncle’s hands, and I hope they\r\ncontain nothing contrary to innocence and honour.--I am still persuaded\r\nthat he is not what he appears to be: but time will discover--mean while\r\nI will endeavour to forget a connexion, which is so displeasing to my\r\nfamily. I have cried without ceasing, and have not tasted any thing but\r\ntea, since I was hurried away from you; nor did I once close my eyes for\r\nthree nights running.--My aunt continues to chide me severely when we\r\nare by ourselves; but I hope to soften her in time, by humility\r\nand submission.--My uncle, who was so dreadfully passionate in the\r\nbeginning, has been moved by my tears and distress; and is now all\r\ntenderness and compassion; and my brother is reconciled to me on my\r\npromise to break off all correspondence with that unfortunate youth;\r\nbut, notwithstanding all their indulgence, I shall have no peace of mind\r\ntill I know my dear and ever honoured governess has forgiven her poor,\r\ndisconsolate, forlorn,\r\n\r\nAffectionate humble servant, till death, LYDIA MELFORD CLIFTON, April 6.\r\n\nTo Miss LAETITIA WILLIS, at Gloucester.\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST LETTY,\r\n\r\nI am in such a fright, lest this should not come safe to hand by the\r\nconveyance of Jarvis the carrier, that I beg you will write me, on the\r\nreceipt of it, directing to me, under cover, to Mrs Winifred Jenkins,\r\nmy aunt’s maid, who is a good girl, and has been so kind to me in my\r\naffliction, that I have made her my confidant; as for Jarvis, he was\r\nvery shy of taking charge of my letter and the little parcel, because\r\nhis sister Sally had like to have lost her place on my account: indeed\r\nI cannot blame the man for his caution; but I have made it worth his\r\nwhile.--My dear companion and bed-fellow, it is a grievous addition to\r\nmy other misfortunes, that I am deprived of your agreeable company and\r\nconversation, at a time when I need so much the comfort of your good\r\nhumour and good sense; but, I hope, the friendship we contracted at\r\nboarding-school, will last for life--I doubt not but on my side it will\r\ndaily increase and improve, as I gain experience, and learn to know the\r\nvalue of a true friend. O, my dear Letty! what shall I say about poor\r\nMr Wilson? I have promised to break off all correspondence, and, if\r\npossible, to forget him: but, alas! I begin to perceive that will not be\r\nin my power. As it is by no means proper that the picture should remain\r\nin my hands, lest it should be the occasion of more mischief, I have\r\nsent it to you by this opportunity, begging you will either keep it safe\r\ntill better times, or return it to Mr Wilson himself, who, I suppose,\r\nwill make it his business to see you at the usual place. If he should be\r\nlow-spirited at my sending back his picture, you may tell him I have no\r\noccasion for a picture, while the original continues engraved on my--But\r\nno; I would not have you tell him that neither; because there must be an\r\nend of our correspondence--I wish he may forget me, for the sake of\r\nhis own peace; and yet if he should, he must be a barbarous--But it is\r\nimpossible--poor Wilson cannot be false and inconstant: I beseech\r\nhim not to write to me, nor attempt to see me for some time; for,\r\nconsidering the resentment and passionate temper of my brother Jery,\r\nsuch an attempt might be attended with consequences which would make\r\nus all miserable for life--let us trust to time and the chapter of\r\naccidents; or rather to that Providence which will not fail, sooner or\r\nlater, to reward those that walk in the paths of honour and virtue. I\r\nwould offer my love to the young ladies; but it is not fit that any of\r\nthem should know you have received this letter.--If we go to Bath,\r\nI shall send you my simple remarks upon that famous center of polite\r\namusement, and every other place we may chance to visit; and I flatter\r\nmyself that my dear Miss Willis will be punctual in answering the\r\nletters of her affectionate,\r\n\r\nLYDIA MELFORD CLIFTON, April 6.\r\n\nTo Dr LEWIS.\r\n\r\nDEAR LEWIS,\r\n\r\nI have followed your directions with some success, and might have\r\nbeen upon my legs by this time, had the weather permitted me to use my\r\nsaddle-horse. I rode out upon the Downs last Tuesday, in the forenoon,\r\nwhen the sky, as far as the visible horizon, was without a cloud; but\r\nbefore I had gone a full mile, I was overtaken instantaneously by a\r\nstorm of rain that wet me to the skin in three minutes--whence it came\r\nthe devil knows; but it has laid me up (I suppose) for one fortnight.\r\nIt makes me sick to hear people talk of the fine air upon Clifton-downs:\r\nHow can the air be either agreeable or salutary, where the demon of\r\nvapours descends in a perpetual drizzle? My confinement is the more\r\nintolerable, as I am surrounded with domestic vexations. My niece has\r\nhad a dangerous fit of illness, occasioned by that cursed incident at\r\nGloucester, which I mentioned in my last.--She is a poor good-natured\r\nsimpleton, as soft as butter, and as easily melted--not that she’s a\r\nfool--the girl’s parts are not despicable, and her education has not\r\nbeen neglected; that is to say, she can write and spell, and speak\r\nFrench, and play upon the harpsichord; then she dances finely, has a\r\ngood figure, and is very well inclined; but, she’s deficient in spirit,\r\nand so susceptible--and so tender forsooth!--truly, she has got a\r\nlanguishing eye, and reads romances.--Then there’s her brother, ‘squire\r\nJery, a pert jackanapes, full of college-petulance and self-conceit;\r\nproud as a German count, and as hot and hasty as a Welch mountaineer. As\r\nfor that fantastical animal, my sister Tabby, you are no stranger to her\r\nqualifications--I vow to God, she is sometimes so intolerable, that I\r\nalmost think she’s the devil incarnate come to torment me for my\r\nsins; and yet I am conscious of no sins that ought to entail such\r\nfamily-plagues upon me--why the devil should not I shake off these\r\ntorments at once? I an’t married to Tabby, thank Heaven! nor did I beget\r\nthe other two: let them choose another guardian: for my part I an’t in\r\na condition to take care of myself; much less to superintend the\r\nconduct of giddy-headed boys and girls. You earnestly desire to know the\r\nparticulars of our adventure at Gloucester, which are briefly these, and\r\nI hope they will go no further:--Liddy had been so long copped up in a\r\nboarding-school, which, next to a nunnery, is the worst kind of seminary\r\nthat ever was contrived for young women, that she became as inflammable\r\nas touch-wood; and going to a play in holiday-time,--‘sdeath, I’m\r\nashamed to tell you! she fell in love with one of the actors--a handsome\r\nyoung fellow that goes by the name of Wilson. The rascal soon perceived\r\nthe impression he had made, and managed matters so as to see her at\r\na house where she went to drink tea with her governess.--This was the\r\nbeginning of a correspondence, which they kept up by means of a jade\r\nof a milliner, who made and dressed caps for the girls at the\r\nboarding-school. When we arrived at Gloucester, Liddy came to stay at\r\nlodgings with her aunt, and Wilson bribed the maid to deliver a letter\r\ninto her own hands; but it seems Jery had already acquired so much\r\ncredit with the maid (by what means he best knows) that she carried\r\nthe letter to him, and so the whole plot was discovered. The rash boy,\r\nwithout saying a word of the matter to me, went immediately in search\r\nof Wilson; and, I suppose, treated him with insolence enough. The\r\ntheatrical hero was too far gone in romance to brook such usage: he\r\nreplied in blank verse, and a formal challenge ensued. They agreed to\r\nmeet early next morning and decide the dispute with sword and pistol. I\r\nheard nothing at all of the affair, till Mr Morley came to my bed-side\r\nin the morning, and told me he was afraid my nephew was going to fight,\r\nas he had been overheard talking very loud and vehement with Wilson\r\nat the young man’s lodgings the night before, and afterwards went\r\nand bought powder and ball at a shop in the neighbourhood. I got up\r\nimmediately, and upon inquiry found he was just going out. I begged\r\nMorley to knock up the mayor, that he might interpose as a magistrate,\r\nand in the mean time I hobbled after the squire, whom I saw at a\r\ndistance walking at a great pace towards the city gate--in spite of all\r\nmy efforts, I could not come up till our two combatants had taken their\r\nground, and were priming their pistols. An old house luckily screened\r\nme from their view; so that I rushed upon them at once, before I was\r\nperceived. They were both confounded, and attempted to make their escape\r\ndifferent ways; but Morley coming up with constables, at that instant,\r\ntook Wilson into custody, and Jery followed him quietly to the mayor’s\r\nhouse. All this time I was ignorant of what had passed the preceding\r\nday; and neither of the parties would discover a tittle of the matter.\r\nThe mayor observed that it was great presumption in Wilson, who was a\r\nstroller, to proceed to such extremities with a gentleman of family and\r\nfortune; and threatened to commit him on the vagrant act.--The young\r\nfellow bustled up with great spirit, declaring he was a gentleman, and\r\nwould be treated as such; but he refused to explain himself further. The\r\nmaster of the company being sent for, and examined, touching the said\r\nWilson, said the young man had engaged with him at Birmingham about six\r\nmonths ago; but never would take his salary; that he had behaved so well\r\nin his private character, as to acquire the respect and good-will of all\r\nhis acquaintance, and that the public owned his merit as an actor was\r\naltogether extraordinary.--After all, I fancy, he will turn out to be a\r\nrun-away prentice from London.--The manager offered to bail him for any\r\nsum, provided he would give his word and honour that he would keep the\r\npeace; but the young gentleman was on his high ropes, and would by no\r\nmeans lay himself under any restrictions: on the other hand, Hopeful was\r\nequally obstinate; till at length the mayor declared, that if they\r\nboth refused to be bound over, he would immediately commit Wilson as a\r\nvagrant to hard labour. I own I was much pleased with Jery’s behaviour\r\non this occasion: he said, that rather than Mr Wilson should be treated\r\nin such an ignominious manner, he would give his word and honour\r\nto prosecute the affair no further while they remained at\r\nGloucester--Wilson thanked him for his generous manner of proceeding,\r\nand was discharged. On our return to our lodgings, my nephew explained\r\nthe whole mystery; and I own I was exceedingly incensed--Liddy being\r\nquestioned on the subject, and very severely reproached by that wildcat\r\nmy sister Tabby, first swooned away, then dissolving in a flood of\r\ntears, confessed all the particulars of the correspondence, at the same\r\ntime giving up three letters, which was all she had received from her\r\nadmirer. The last, which Jery intercepted, I send you inclosed, and when\r\nyou have read it, I dare say you won’t wonder at the progress the writer\r\nhad made in the heart of a simple girl, utterly unacquainted with the\r\ncharacters of mankind. Thinking it was high time to remove her from such\r\na dangerous connexion, I carried her off the very next day to Bristol;\r\nbut the poor creature was so frightened and fluttered, by our threats\r\nand expostulations, that she fell sick the fourth day after our arrival\r\nat Clifton, and continued so ill for a whole week, that her life was\r\ndespaired of. It was not till yesterday that Dr Rigge declared her out\r\nof danger. You cannot imagine what I have suffered, partly from the\r\nindiscretion of this poor child, but much more from the fear of\r\nlosing her entirely. This air is intolerably cold, and the place quite\r\nsolitary--I never go down to the Well without returning low-spirited;\r\nfor there I meet with half a dozen poor emaciated creatures, with\r\nghostly looks, in the last stage of a consumption, who have made shift\r\nto linger through the winter like so many exotic plants languishing in a\r\nhot-house; but in all appearance, will drop into their graves before\r\nthe sun has warmth enough to mitigate the rigour of this ungenial\r\nspring.--If you think the Bath-water will be of any service to me, I\r\nwill go thither so soon as my niece can bear the motion of the coach.\r\nTell Barns I am obliged to him for his advice; but don’t choose to\r\nfollow it. If Davis voluntarily offers to give up the farm, the other\r\nshall have it; but I will not begin at this time of day to distress my\r\ntenants, because they are unfortunate, and cannot make regular payments:\r\nI wonder that Barns should think me capable of such oppression--As for\r\nHiggins, the fellow is a notorious poacher, to be sure; and an impudent\r\nrascal to set his snares in my own paddock; but, I suppose, he thought\r\nhe had some right (especially in my absence) to partake of what nature\r\nseems to have intended for common use--you may threaten him in my name,\r\nas much as you please, and if he repeats the offence, let me know it\r\nbefore you have recourse to justice.--I know you are a great sportsman,\r\nand oblige many of your friends: I need not tell you to make use of my\r\ngrounds; but it may be necessary to hint, that I am more afraid of my\r\nfowling-piece than of my game. When you can spare two or three brace of\r\npartridges, send them over by the stagecoach, and tell Gwyllim that she\r\nforgot to pack up my flannel and wide shoes in the trunk-mail--I shall\r\ntrouble you as usual, from time to time, till at last I suppose you will\r\nbe tired of corresponding with\r\n\r\nYour assured friend, M. BRAMBLE CLIFTON, April 17.\r\n\nTo Miss LYDIA MELFORD.\r\n\r\nMiss Willis has pronounced my doom--you are going away, dear Miss\r\nMelford!--you are going to be removed, I know not whither! what shall I\r\ndo? which way shall I turn for consolation? I know not what I say--all\r\nnight long have I been tossed in a sea of doubts and fears, uncertainty\r\nand distraction, without being able to connect my thoughts, much less to\r\nform any consistent plan of conduct--I was even tempted to wish that\r\nI had never seen you; or that you had been less amiable, or less\r\ncompassionate to your poor Wilson; and yet it would be detestable\r\ningratitude in me to form such a wish, considering how much I am\r\nindebted to your goodness, and the ineffable pleasure I have derived\r\nfrom your indulgence and approbation--Good God! I never heard your name\r\nmentioned without emotion! the most distant prospect of being admitted\r\nto your company, filled my whole soul with a kind of pleasing alarm! as\r\nthe time approached, my heart beat with redoubled force, and every\r\nnerve thrilled with a transport of expectation; but, when I found myself\r\nactually in your presence;--when I heard you speak;--when I saw you\r\nsmile; when I beheld your charming eyes turned favourably upon me; my\r\nbreast was filled with such tumults of delight, as wholly deprived me of\r\nthe power of utterance, and wrapt me in a delirium of joy!--encouraged\r\nby your sweetness of temper and affability, I ventured to describe the\r\nfeelings of my heart--even then you did not check my presumption--you\r\npitied my sufferings and gave me leave to hope you put a\r\nfavourable--perhaps too favourable a construction, on my\r\nappearance--certain it is, I am no player in love--I speak the language\r\nof my own heart; and have no prompter but nature. Yet there is something\r\nin this heart, which I have not yet disclosed.--I flattered myself--But,\r\nI will not--I must not proceed. Dear Miss Liddy! for Heaven’s sake,\r\ncontrive, if possible, some means of letting me speak to you before you\r\nleave Gloucester; otherwise, I know not what will--But I begin to rave\r\nagain.--I will endeavour to bear this trial with fortitude--while I am\r\ncapable of reflecting upon your tenderness and truth, I surely have no\r\ncause to despair--a cloud hangs over me, and there is a dreadful weight\r\nupon my spirits! While you stay in this place, I shall continually hover\r\nabout your lodgings, as the parted soul is said to linger about the\r\ngrave where its mortal comfort lies.--I know, if it is in your power,\r\nyou will task your humanity--your compassion--shall I add, your\r\naffection?--in order to assuage the almost intolerable disquiet that\r\ntorments the heart of your afflicted,\r\n\r\nWILSON GLOUCESTER, March 31.\r\n\nTo Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of Jesus college, Oxon.\r\n\r\nHOT WELL, April 18.\r\n\r\nDEAR PHILLIPS,\r\n\r\nI give Mansel credit for his invention, in propagating the report that I\r\nhad a quarrel with a mountebank’s merry Andrew at Gloucester: but I have\r\ntoo much respect for every appendage of wit, to quarrel even with the\r\nlowest buffoonery; and therefore I hope Mansel and I shall always be\r\ngood friends. I cannot, however, approve of his drowning my poor\r\ndog Ponto, on purpose to convert Ovid’s pleonasm into a punning\r\nepitaph,--deerant quoque Littora Ponto: for, that he threw him into the\r\nIsis, when it was so high and impetuous, with no other view than to kill\r\nthe fleas, is an excuse that will not hold water--But I leave poor Ponto\r\nto his fate, and hope Providence will take care to accommodate Mansel\r\nwith a drier death.\r\n\r\nAs there is nothing that can be called company at the Well, I am here\r\nin a state of absolute rustication: This, however, gives me leisure to\r\nobserve the singularities in my uncle’s character, which seems to have\r\ninterested your curiosity. The truth is, his disposition and mine,\r\nwhich, like oil and vinegar, repelled one another at first, have now\r\nbegun to mix by dint of being beat up together. I was once apt to\r\nbelieve him a complete Cynic; and that nothing but the necessity of his\r\noccasions could compel him to get within the pale of society--I am now\r\nof another opinion. I think his peevishness arises partly from bodily\r\npain, and partly from a natural excess of mental sensibility; for, I\r\nsuppose, the mind as well as the body, is in some cases endued with a\r\nmorbid excess of sensation.\r\n\r\nI was t’other day much diverted with a conversation that passed in the\r\nPump-room, betwixt him and the famous Dr L--n, who is come to ply at the\r\nWell for patients. My uncle was complaining of the stink, occasioned\r\nby the vast quantity of mud and slime which the river leaves at low ebb\r\nunder the windows of the Pumproom. He observed, that the exhalations\r\narising from such a nuisance, could not but be prejudicial to the weak\r\nlungs of many consumptive patients, who came to drink the water. The\r\nDoctor overhearing this remark, made up to him, and assured him he was\r\nmistaken. He said, people in general were so misled by vulgar prejudices\r\nthat philosophy was hardly sufficient to undeceive them. Then humming\r\nthrice, he assumed a most ridiculous solemnity of aspect, and entered\r\ninto a learned investigation of the nature of stink. He observed,\r\nthat stink, or stench, meant no more than a strong impression on\r\nthe olfactory nerves; and might be applied to substances of the most\r\nopposite qualities; that in the Dutch language, stinken signifies the\r\nmost agreeable perfume, as well as the most fetid odour, as appears in\r\nVan Vloudel’s translation of Horace, in that beautiful ode, Quis multa\r\ngracilis, &c.--The words fiquidis perfusus odoribus, he translates van\r\ncivet & moschata gestinken: that individuals differed toto coelo in\r\ntheir opinion of smells, which, indeed, was altogether as arbitrary\r\nas the opinion of beauty; that the French were pleased with the putrid\r\neffluvia of animal food; and so were the Hottentots in Africa, and the\r\nSavages in Greenland; and that the Negroes on the coast of Senegal would\r\nnot touch fish till it was rotten; strong presumptions in favour of what\r\nis generally called stink, as those nations are in a state of nature,\r\nundebauched by luxury, unseduced by whim and caprice: that he had reason\r\nto believe the stercoraceous flavour, condemned by prejudice as a stink,\r\nwas, in fact, most agreeable to the organs of smelling; for, that every\r\nperson who pretended to nauseate the smell of another’s excretions,\r\nsnuffed up his own with particular complacency; for the truth of which\r\nhe appealed to all the ladies and gentlemen then present: he said, the\r\ninhabitants of Madrid and Edinburgh found particular satisfaction\r\nin breathing their own atmosphere, which was always impregnated with\r\nstercoraceous effluvia: that the learned Dr B--, in his treatise on the\r\nFour Digestions, explains in what manner the volatile effluvia from the\r\nintestines stimulate and promote the operations of the animal economy:\r\nhe affirmed, the last Grand Duke of Tuscany, of the Medicis family,\r\nwho refined upon sensuality with the spirit of a philosopher, was so\r\ndelighted with that odour, that he caused the essence of ordure to be\r\nextracted, and used it as the most delicious perfume: that he himself\r\n(the doctor) when he happened to be low-spirited, or fatigued with\r\nbusiness, found immediate relief and uncommon satisfaction from hanging\r\nover the stale contents of a close-stool, while his servant stirred it\r\nabout under his nose; nor was this effect to be wondered at, when we\r\nconsider that this substance abounds with the self-same volatile salts\r\nthat are so greedily smelled to by the most delicate invalids, after\r\nthey have been extracted and sublimed by the chemists.--By this time the\r\ncompany began to hold their noses; but the doctor, without taking\r\nthe least notice of this signal, proceeded to shew, that many fetid\r\nsubstances were not only agreeable but salutary; such as assa foetida,\r\nand other medicinal gums, resins, roots, and vegetables, over and above\r\nburnt feathers, tan-pits, candle-snuffs, &c. In short, he used many\r\nlearned arguments to persuade his audience out of their senses; and from\r\nstench made a transition to filth, which he affirmed was also a mistaken\r\nidea, in as much as objects so called, were no other than certain\r\nmodifications of matter, consisting of the same principles that enter\r\ninto the composition of all created essences, whatever they may be: that\r\nin the filthiest production of nature, a philosopher considered nothing\r\nbut the earth, water, salt and air, of which it was compounded; that,\r\nfor his own part, he had no more objections to drinking the dirtiest\r\nditch-water, than he had to a glass of water from the Hot Well, provided\r\nhe was assured there was nothing poisonous in the concrete. Then\r\naddressing himself to my uncle, ‘Sir (said he) you seem to be of a\r\ndropsical habit, and probably will soon have a confirmed ascites: if\r\nI should be present when you are tapped, I will give you a convincing\r\nproof of what I assert, by drinking without hesitation the water\r\nthat comes out of your abdomen.’--The ladies made wry faces at this\r\ndeclaration, and my uncle, changing colour, told him he did not desire\r\nany such proof of his philosophy: ‘But I should be glad to know (said\r\nhe) what makes you think I am of a dropsical habit?’ ‘Sir, I beg pardon\r\n(replied the Doctor) I perceive your ancles are swelled, and you seem to\r\nhave the facies leucophlegmatica. Perhaps, indeed, your disorder may\r\nbe oedematous, or gouty, or it may be the lues venerea: If you have any\r\nreason to flatter yourself it is this last, sir, I will undertake\r\nto cure you with three small pills, even if the disease should have\r\nattained its utmost inveteracy. Sir, it is an arcanum, which I have\r\ndiscovered, and prepared with infinite labour.--Sir, I have lately cured\r\na woman in Bristol--a common prostitute, sir, who had got all the worst\r\nsymptoms of the disorder; such as nodi, tophi, and gummata, verruca,\r\ncristoe Galli, and a serpiginous eruption, or rather a pocky itch\r\nall over her body. By the time she had taken the second pill, sir, by\r\nHeaven! she was as smooth as my hand, and the third made her sound and\r\nas fresh as a new born infant.’ ‘Sir (cried my uncle peevishly) I have\r\nno reason to flatter myself that my disorder comes within the efficacy\r\nof your nostrum. But this patient you talk of may not be so sound at\r\nbottom as you imagine.’ ‘I can’t possibly be mistaken (rejoined the\r\nphilosopher) for I have had communication with her three times--I always\r\nascertain my cures in that manner.’ At this remark, all the ladies\r\nretired to another corner of the room, and some of them began to\r\nspit.--As to my uncle, though he was ruffled at first by the doctor’s\r\nsaying he was dropsical, he could not help smiling at this ridiculous\r\nconfession and, I suppose, with a view to punish this original, told\r\nhim there was a wart upon his nose, that looked a little suspicious. ‘I\r\ndon’t pretend to be a judge of those matters (said he) but I understand\r\nthat warts are often produced by the distemper; and that one upon your\r\nnose seems to have taken possession of the very keystone of the\r\nbridge, which I hope is in no danger of falling.’ L--n seemed a little\r\nconfounded at this remark, and assured him it was nothing but a common\r\nexcrescence of the cuticula, but that the bones were all sound below;\r\nfor the truth of this assertion he appealed to the touch, desiring he\r\nwould feel the part. My uncle said it was a matter of such delicacy to\r\nmeddle with a gentleman’s nose, that he declined the office--upon which,\r\nthe Doctor turning to me, intreated me to do him that favour. I complied\r\nwith his request, and handled it so roughly, that he sneezed, and the\r\ntears ran down his cheeks, to the no small entertainment of the company,\r\nand particularly of my uncle, who burst out a-laughing for the first\r\ntime since I have been with him; and took notice, that the part seemed\r\nto be very tender. ‘Sir (cried the Doctor) it is naturally a tender\r\npart; but to remove all possibility of doubt, I will take off the wart\r\nthis very night.’\r\n\r\nSo saying, he bowed, with great solemnity all round, and retired to his\r\nown lodgings, where he applied a caustic to the wart; but it spread in\r\nsuch a manner as to produce a considerable inflammation, attended with\r\nan enormous swelling; so that when he next appeared, his whole face was\r\novershadowed by this tremendous nozzle; and the rueful eagerness with\r\nwhich he explained this unlucky accident, was ludicrous beyond all\r\ndescription.--I was much pleased with meeting the original of a\r\ncharacter, which you and I have often laughed at in description; and\r\nwhat surprises me very much, I find the features in the picture, which\r\nhas been drawn for him, rather softened than over-charged.\r\n\r\nAs I have something else to say; and this letter has run to an\r\nunconscionable length, I shall now give you a little respite, and\r\ntrouble you again by the very first post. I wish you would take it in\r\nyour head to retaliate these double strokes upon\r\n\r\nYours always, J. MELFORD\r\n\nTo Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of Jesus college, Oxon.\r\n\r\nHOT WELL, April 20.\r\n\r\nDEAR KNIGHT,\r\n\r\nI now sit down to execute the threat in the tail of my last. The truth\r\nis, I am big with the secret, and long to be delivered. It relates to my\r\nguardian, who, you know, is at present our principal object in view.\r\n\r\nT’other day, I thought I had detected him in such a state of frailty, as\r\nwould but ill become his years and character. There is a decent sort of\r\nwoman, not disagreeable in her person, that comes to the Well, with a\r\npoor emaciated child, far gone in a consumption. I had caught my uncle’s\r\neyes several times directed to this person, with a very suspicious\r\nexpression in them, and every time he saw himself observed, he hastily\r\nwithdrew them, with evident marks of confusion--I resolved to watch him\r\nmore narrowly, and saw him speaking to her privately in a corner of the\r\nwalk. At length, going down to the Well one day, I met her half way up\r\nthe hill to Clifton, and could not help suspecting she was going to our\r\nlodgings by appointment, as it was about one o’clock, the hour when my\r\nsister and I are generally at the Pump-room.--This notion exciting my\r\ncuriosity, I returned by a back-way, and got unperceived into my own\r\nchamber, which is contiguous to my uncle’s apartment. Sure enough, the\r\nwoman was introduced but not into his bedchamber; he gave her audience\r\nin a parlour; so that I was obliged to shift my station to another room,\r\nwhere, however, there was a small chink in the partition, through which\r\nI could perceive what passed. My uncle, though a little lame, rose up\r\nwhen she came in, and setting a chair for her, desired she would sit\r\ndown: then he asked if she would take a dish of chocolate, which she\r\ndeclined, with much acknowledgment. After a short pause, he said, in a\r\ncroaking tone of voice, which confounded me not a little, ‘Madam, I am\r\ntruly concerned for your misfortunes; and if this trifle can be of any\r\nservice to you, I beg you will accept it without ceremony.’ So saying,\r\nhe put a bit of paper into her hand, which she opening with great\r\ntrepidation, exclaimed in an extacy, ‘Twenty pounds! Oh, sir!’ and\r\nsinking down upon a settee, fainted away--Frightened at this fit, and,\r\nI suppose, afraid of calling for assistance, lest her situation\r\nshould give rise to unfavourable conjectures, he ran about the room in\r\ndistraction, making frightful grimaces; and, at length, had recollection\r\nenough to throw a little water in her face; by which application she was\r\nbrought to herself: but, then her feeling took another turn. She shed\r\na flood of tears, and cried aloud, ‘I know not who you are: but,\r\nsure--worthy sir--generous sir!--the distress of me and my poor dying\r\nchild--Oh! if the widow’s prayers--if the orphan’s tears of gratitude\r\ncan ought avail--gracious Providence--Blessings!--shower down eternal\r\nblessings.’--Here she was interrupted by my uncle, who muttered in\r\na voice still more and more discordant, ‘For Heaven’s sake be quiet,\r\nmadam--consider--the people of the house--‘sdeath! can’t you.’--All this\r\ntime she was struggling to throw herself on her knees, while he seizing\r\nher by the wrists, endeavoured to seat her upon the settee, saying,\r\n‘Prithee--good now--hold your tongue’--At that instant, who should\r\nburst into--the room but our aunt Tabby! of all antiquated maidens the\r\nmost diabolically capricious--Ever prying into other people’s affairs,\r\nshe had seen the woman enter, and followed her to the door, where she\r\nstood listening, but probably could hear nothing distinctly, except my\r\nuncle’s, last exclamation; at which she bounded into the parlour in a\r\nviolent rage, that dyed the tip of her nose of a purple hue,--‘Fy upon\r\nyou, Matt! (cried she) what doings are these, to disgrace your own\r\ncharacter, and disparage your family?’--Then, snatching the bank note\r\nout of the stranger’s hand, she went on--‘How now, twenty\r\npounds!--here is temptation with a witness!--Good-woman, go about\r\nyour business--Brother, brother, I know not which most to admire; your\r\nconcupissins, or your extravagance!’--‘Good God (exclaimed the poor\r\nwoman) shall a worthy gentleman’s character suffer for an action\r\nthat does honour to humanity?’ By this time, uncle’s indignation was\r\neffectually roused. His face grew pale, his teeth chattered, and his\r\neyes flashed--‘Sister (cried he, in a voice like thunder) I vow to God,\r\nyour impertinence is exceedingly provoking.’ With these words, he took\r\nher by the hand, and, opening the door of communication, thrust her into\r\nthe chamber where I stood, so affected by the scene, that the tears ran\r\ndown my cheeks. Observing these marks of emotion, ‘I don’t wonder (said\r\nshe) to see you concerned at the back-slidings of so near a relation; a\r\nman of his years and infirmities: These are fine doings, truly--This\r\nis a rare example, set by a guardian, for the benefit of his\r\npupils--Monstrous! incongruous! sophistical!’--I thought it was but\r\nan act of justice to set her to rights; and therefore explained the\r\nmystery. But she would not be undeceived, ‘What (said she) would you\r\ngo for to offer for to arguefy me out of my senses? Did’n’t I hear\r\nhim whispering to her to hold her tongue? Did’n’t I see her in tears?\r\nDid’n’t I see him struggling to throw her upon the couch? 0 filthy!\r\nhideous! abominable! Child, child, talk not to me of charity.--Who gives\r\ntwenty pounds in charity?--But you are a stripling--You know nothing of\r\nthe world. Besides, charity begins at home--Twenty pounds would buy me a\r\ncomplete suit of flowered silk, trimmings and all--’ In short, I quitted\r\nthe room, my contempt for her, and my respect for her brother, being\r\nincreased in the same proportion. I have since been informed, that the\r\nperson, whom my uncle so generously relieved, is the widow of an ensign,\r\nwho has nothing to depend upon but the pension of fifteen pounds a year.\r\nThe people of the Well-house give her an excellent character. She lodges\r\nin a garret, and works very hard at plain work, to support her daughter,\r\nwho is dying of a consumption. I must own, to my shame, I feel a strong\r\ninclination to follow my uncle’s example, in relieving this poor widow;\r\nbut, betwixt friends, I am afraid of being detected in a weakness, that\r\nmight entail the ridicule of the company, upon,\r\n\r\nDear Phillips, Yours always, J. MELFORD\r\n\r\nDirect your next to me at Bath; and remember me to all our\r\nfellow-jesuits.\r\n\nTo Dr LEWIS.\r\n\r\nHOT WELL, April 20.\r\n\r\nI understand your hint. There are mysteries in physic, as well as in\r\nreligion; which we of the profane have no right to investigate--A\r\nman must not presume to use his reason, unless he has studied the\r\ncategories, and can chop logic by mode and figure--Between friends, I\r\nthink every man of tolerable parts ought, at my time of day, to be both\r\nphysician and lawyer, as far as his own constitution and property are\r\nconcerned. For my own part, I have had an hospital these fourteen years\r\nwithin myself, and studied my own case with the most painful attention;\r\nconsequently may be supposed to know something of the matter, although\r\nI have not taken regular courses of physiology et cetera et cetera.--\r\nIn short, I have for some time been of opinion (no offence, dear Doctor)\r\nthat the sum of all your medical discoveries amounts to this, that the\r\nmore you study the less you know.--I have read all that has been written\r\non the Hot Wells, and what I can collect from the whole, is, that the\r\nwater contains nothing but a little salt, and calcarious earth, mixed in\r\nsuch inconsiderable proportion, as can have very little, if any, effect\r\non the animal economy. This being the case, I think the man deserves to\r\nbe fitted with a cap and bells, who for such a paultry advantage as this\r\nspring affords, sacrifices his precious time, which might be employed\r\nin taking more effectual remedies, and exposes himself to the dirt, the\r\nstench, the chilling blasts, and perpetual rains, that render this place\r\nto me intolerable. If these waters, from a small degree of astringency,\r\nare of some service in the diabetes, diarrhoea, and night sweats, when\r\nthe secretions are too much increased, must not they do harm in the same\r\nproportion, where the humours are obstructed, as in the asthma,\r\nscurvy, gout and dropsy?--Now we talk of the dropsy, here is a strange\r\nfantastical oddity, one of your brethren, who harangues every day in\r\nthe Pump-room, as if he was hired to give lectures on all subjects\r\nwhatsoever--I know not what to make of him--Sometimes he makes\r\nshrewd remarks; at other times he talks like the greatest simpleton in\r\nnature--He has read a great deal; but without method or judgment, and\r\ndigested nothing. He believes every thing he has read; especially if\r\nit has any thing of the marvellous in it and his conversation is a\r\nsurprizing hotch-potch of erudition and extravagance. He told me t’other\r\nday, with great confidence, that my case was dropsical; or, as he called\r\nit, leucophlegmatic: A sure sign, that his want of experience is equal\r\nto his presumption--for, you know, there is nothing analogous to the\r\ndropsy in my disorder--I wish those impertinent fellows, with their\r\nricketty understandings, would keep their advice for those that ask it.\r\nDropsy, indeed! Sure I have not lived to the age of fifty-five, and had\r\nsuch experience of my own disorder, and consulted you and other eminent\r\nphysicians, so often, and so long, to be undeceived by such a--But,\r\nwithout all doubt, the man is mad; and, therefore, what he says is of\r\nno consequence. I had, yesterday, a visit from Higgins, who came hither\r\nunder the terror of your threats, and brought me in a present a brace of\r\nhares, which he owned he took in my ground; and I could not persuade\r\nthe fellow that he did wrong, or that I would ever prosecute him for\r\npoaching--I must desire you will wink hard at the practices of this\r\nrascallion, otherwise I shall be plagued with his presents, which cost\r\nme more than they are worth.--If I could wonder at any thing Fitzowen\r\ndoes, I should be surprized at his assurance in desiring you to solicit\r\nmy vote for him at the next election for the county: for him, who\r\nopposed me, on the like occasion, with the most illiberal competition.\r\nYou may tell him civilly, that I beg to be excused. Direct your next for\r\nme at Bath, whither I propose to remove to-morrow; not only on my own\r\naccount, but for the sake of my niece, Liddy, who is like to relapse.\r\nThe poor creature fell into a fit yesterday, while I was cheapening a\r\npair of spectacles, with a Jew-pedlar. I am afraid there is something\r\nstill lurking in that little heart of hers, which I hope a change of\r\nobjects will remove. Let me know what you think of this half-witted\r\nDoctor’s impertinent, ridiculous, and absurd notion of my disorder--So\r\nfar from being dropsical, I am as lank in the belly as a grey-hound;\r\nand, by measuring my ancle with a pack-thread, I find the swelling\r\nsubsides every day. From such doctors, good Lord deliver us!--I have not\r\nyet taken any lodgings in Bath; because there we can be accommodated at\r\na minute’s warning, and I shall choose for myself--I need not say your\r\ndirections for drinking and bathing will be agreeable to,\r\n\r\nDear Lewis, Yours ever, MAT. BRAMBLE\r\n\r\nP.S. I forgot to tell you, that my right ancle pits, a symptom, as I\r\ntake it, of its being oedematous, not leucophlegmatic.\r\n\nTo Miss LETTY WILLIS, at Gloucester\r\n\r\nHOT WELL, April 21.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR LETTY,\r\n\r\nI did not intend to trouble you again, till we should be settled at\r\nBath; but having the occasion of Jarvis, I could not let it slip,\r\nespecially as I have something extraordinary to communicate. O, my dear\r\ncompanion! What shall I tell you? for several days past there was a\r\nJew-looking man, that plied at the Wells with a box of spectacles; and\r\nhe always eyed me so earnestly, that I began to be very uneasy. At last,\r\nhe came to our lodgings at Clifton, and lingered about the door, as\r\nif he wanted to speak to somebody--I was seized with an odd kind of\r\nfluttering, and begged Win to throw herself in his way: but the poor\r\ngirl has weak nerves, and was afraid of his beard. My uncle, having\r\noccasion for new glasses, called him up stairs, and was trying a pair\r\nof spectacles, when the man, advancing to me, said in a whisper--O\r\ngracious! what d’ye think he said?--‘I am Wilson!’ His features struck\r\nme that very moment it was Wilson, sure enough! but so disguised, that\r\nit would have been impossible to know him, if my heart had not assisted\r\nin the discovery. I was so surprised, and so frightened that I fainted\r\naway, but soon recovered; and found myself supported by him on the\r\nchair, while my uncle was running about the room, with the spectacles\r\non his nose, calling for help. I had no opportunity to speak to him; but\r\nlooks were sufficiently expressive. He was payed for his glasses, and\r\nwent away. Then I told Win who he was, and sent her after him to the\r\nPump-room; where she spoke to him, and begged him in my name to withdraw\r\nfrom the place, that he might not incur the suspicion of my uncle or my\r\nbrother, if he did not want to see me die of terror and vexation. The\r\npoor youth declared, with tears in his eyes, that he had something\r\nextraordinary to communicate; and asked, if she would deliver a letter\r\nto me: but this she absolutely refused, by my order.--Finding her\r\nobstinate in her refusal, he desired she would tell me that he was no\r\nlonger a player, but a gentleman; in which character he would very soon\r\navow his passion for me, without fear of censure or reproach--Nay,\r\nhe even discovered his name and family, which, to my great grief,\r\nthe simple girl forgot, in the confusion occasioned by her being seen\r\ntalking to him by my brother, who stopt her on the road, and asked\r\nwhat business she had with that rascally Jew. She pretended she was\r\ncheapening a stay-hook, but was thrown into such a quandary, that she\r\nforgot the most material part of the information; and when she came\r\nhome, went into an hysteric fit of laughing. This transaction happened\r\nthree days ago, during which he has not appeared, so that I suppose he\r\nhas gone. Dear Letty! you see how Fortune takes pleasure in persecuting\r\nyour poor friend. If you should see him at Gloucester--or if you have\r\nseen him, and know his real name and family, pray keep me no longer in\r\nsuspence--And yet, if he is under no obligation to keep himself longer\r\nconcealed, and has a real affection for me, I should hope he will, in a\r\nlittle time, declare himself to my relations. Sure, if there is\r\nnothing unsuitable in the match, they won’t be so cruel as to thwart my\r\ninclinations--O what happiness would then be my portion! I can’t help\r\nindulging the thought, and pleasing my fancy with such agreeable ideas;\r\nwhich after all, perhaps, will never be realized--But, why should I\r\ndespair? who knows what will happen?--We set out for Bath to-morrow, and\r\nI am almost sorry for it; as I begin to be in love with solitude, and\r\nthis is a charming romantic place. The air is so pure; the Downs are so\r\nagreeable; the furz in full blossom; the ground enamelled with daisies,\r\nand primroses, and cowslips; all the trees bursting into leaves, and the\r\nhedges already clothed with their vernal livery; the mountains covered\r\nwith flocks of sheep and tender bleating wanton lambkins playing,\r\nfrisking, and skipping from side to side; the groves resound with\r\nthe notes of blackbird, thrush, and linnet; and all night long sweet\r\nPhilomel pours forth her ravishingly delightful song. Then, for\r\nvariety, we go down to the nymph of Bristol spring, where the company is\r\nassembled before dinner; so good natured, so free, so easy; and there we\r\ndrink the water so clear, so pure, so mild, so charmingly maukish. There\r\nthe fun is so chearful and reviving; the weather so soft; the walk so\r\nagreeable; the prospect so amusing; and the ships and boats going up and\r\ndown the river, close under the windows of the Pump-room, afford such an\r\nenchanting variety of Moving Pictures, as require a much abler pen than\r\nmine to describe. To make this place a perfect paradise to me, nothing\r\nis wanting but an agreeable companion and sincere friend; such as\r\nmy dear miss Willis hath been, and I hope still will be, to her ever\r\nfaithful.\r\n\r\nLYDIA MELFORD\r\n\r\nDirect for me, still under cover, to Win; and Jarvis will take care to\r\nconvey it safe. Adieu.\r\n\nTo Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of Jesus college, Oxon.\r\n\r\nBATH, April 24.\r\n\r\nDEAR PHILLIPS,\r\n\r\nYou have, indeed, reason to be surprised, that I should have concealed\r\nmy correspondence with miss Blackerby from you, to whom I disclosed all\r\nmy other connexions of that nature; but the truth is, I never dreamed\r\nof any such commerce, till your last informed me, that it had produced\r\nsomething which could not be much longer concealed. It is a lucky\r\ncircumstance, however, that her reputation will not suffer any\r\ndetriment, but rather derive advantage from the discovery; which\r\nwill prove, at least, that it is not quite so rotten as most people\r\nimagined--For my own part, I declare to you, in all the sincerity of\r\nfriendship, that, far from having any amorous intercourse with the\r\nobject in question, I never had the least acquaintance with her person;\r\nbut, if she is really in the condition you describe, I suspect Mansel to\r\nbe at the bottom of the whole. His visits to that shrine were no secret;\r\nand this attachment, added to some good offices, which you know he has\r\ndone me, since I left Alma-mater, give me a right to believe him capable\r\nof saddling me with this scandal, when my back was turned--Nevertheless,\r\nif my name can be of any service to him, he is welcome to make use of\r\nit; and if the woman should be abandoned enough to swear his banding to\r\nme, I must beg the favour of you to compound with the parish: I shall\r\npay the penalty without repining; and you will be so good as to draw\r\nupon me immediately for the sum required--On this occasion, I act by the\r\nadvice of my uncle; who says I shall have good-luck if I pass through\r\nlife without being obliged to make many more compositions of the same\r\nkind. The old gentleman told me last night, with great good-humour, that\r\nbetwixt the age of twenty and forty, he had been obliged to provide for\r\nnine bastards, sworn to him by women whom he never saw--Mr Bramble’s\r\ncharacter, which seems to interest you greatly, opens and improves upon\r\nme every day. His singularities afford a rich mine of entertainment;\r\nhis understanding, so far as I can judge, is well cultivated; his\r\nobservations on life are equally just, pertinent, and uncommon. He\r\naffects misanthropy, in order to conceal the sensibility of a heart,\r\nwhich is tender, even to a degree of weakness. This delicacy of feeling,\r\nor soreness of the mind, makes him timorous and fearful; but then he\r\nis afraid of nothing so much as of dishonour; and although he is\r\nexceedingly cautious of giving offence, he will fire at the least hint\r\nof insolence or ill-breeding.--Respectable as he is, upon the whole,\r\nI can’t help being sometimes diverted by his little distresses; which\r\nprovoke him to let fly the shafts of his satire, keen and penetrating\r\nas the arrows of Teucer--Our aunt, Tabitha, acts upon him as a perpetual\r\ngrind-stone--She is, in all respects, a striking contrast to her\r\nbrother--But I reserve her portrait for another occasion.\r\n\r\nThree days ago we came hither from the Hot Well, and took possession\r\nof the first floor of a lodging-house, on the South Parade; a situation\r\nwhich my uncle chose, for its being near the Bath, and remote from the\r\nnoise of carriages. He was scarce warm in the lodgings when he called\r\nfor his night-cap, his wide shoes, and flannel; and declared himself\r\ninvested with the gout in his right foot; though, I believe it had as\r\nyet reached no farther than his imagination. It was not long before he\r\nhad reason to repent his premature declaration; for our aunt Tabitha\r\nfound means to make such a clamour and confusion, before the flannels\r\ncould be produced from the trunk, that one would have imagined the house\r\nwas on fire. All this time, uncle sat boiling with impatience, biting\r\nhis fingers, throwing up his eyes, and muttering ejaculations; at length\r\nhe burst into a kind of convulsive laugh, after which he hummed a song;\r\nand when the hurricane was over, exclaimed ‘Blessed be God for all\r\nthings!’ This, however, was but the beginning of his troubles. Mrs\r\nTabitha’s favourite dog Chowder, having paid his compliments to a female\r\nturnspit of his own species, in the kitchen, involved himself in a\r\nquarrel with no fewer than five rivals, who set upon him at once, and\r\ndrove him up stairs to the dining room door, with hideous noise: there\r\nour aunt and her woman, taking arms in his defence, joined the\r\nconcert; which became truly diabolical. This fray being with difficulty\r\nsuppressed, by the intervention of our own footman and the cook-maid\r\nof the house, the squire had just opened his mouth, to expostulate with\r\nTabby, when the town-waits, in the passage below, struck up their music\r\n(if music it may be called) with such a sudden burst of sound, as made\r\nhim start and stare, with marks of indignation and disquiet. He had\r\nrecollection enough to send his servant with some money to silence those\r\nnoisy intruders; and they were immediately dismissed, though not without\r\nsome opposition on the part of Tabitha, who thought it but reasonable\r\nthat he should have more music for his money. Scarce had he settled this\r\nknotty point, when a strange kind of thumping and bouncing was heard\r\nright over-head, in the second story, so loud and violent, as to shake\r\nthe whole building. I own I was exceedingly provoked at this new alarm;\r\nand before my uncle had time to express himself on the subject, I ran\r\nup stairs, to see what was the matter. Finding the room-door open, I\r\nentered without ceremony, and perceived an object, which I can not now\r\nrecollect without laughing to excess--It was a dancing master, with his\r\nscholar, in the act of teaching. The master was blind of one eye, and\r\nlame of one foot, and led about the room his pupil; who seemed to be\r\nabout the age of threescore, stooped mortally, was tall, raw-boned,\r\nhard-favoured, with a woollen night-cap on his head; and he had stript\r\noff his coat, that he might be more nimble in his motions--Finding\r\nhimself intruded upon, by a person he did not know, he forthwith girded\r\nhimself with a long iron sword, and advancing to me, with a peremptory\r\nair, pronounced, in a true Hibernian accent, ‘Mister What d’ye callum,\r\nby my saoul and conscience, I am very glad to sea you, if you are after\r\ncoming in the way of friendship; and indeed, and indeed now, I believe\r\nyou are my friend sure enough, gra; though I never had the honour to sea\r\nyour face before, my dear; for becaase you come like a friend, without\r\nany ceremony at all, at all’--I told him the nature of my visit would\r\nnot admit of ceremony; that I was come to desire he would make less\r\nnoise, as there was a sick gentleman below, whom he had no right\r\nto disturb with such preposterous doings. ‘Why, look-ye now, young\r\ngentleman (replied this original) perhaps, upon another occasion, I\r\nmight shivilly request you to explain the maining of that hard word,\r\nprepasterous: but there’s a time for all things, honey’--So saying,\r\nhe passed me with great agility, and, running down stairs, found our\r\nfoot-man at the dining-room door, of whom he demanded admittance, to\r\npay his respects to the stranger. As the fellow did not think proper\r\nto refuse the request of such a formidable figure, he was immediately\r\nintroduced, and addressed himself to my uncle in these words: ‘Your\r\nhumble servant, good sir,--I’m not so prepasterous, as your son calls\r\nit, but I know the rules of shivility--I’m a poor knight of Ireland,\r\nmy name is sir Ulic Mackilligut, of the county of Galway; being your\r\nfellow-lodger, I’m come to pay my respects, and to welcome you to the\r\nSouth Parade, and to offer my best services to you, and your good lady,\r\nand your pretty daughter; and even to the young gentleman your son,\r\nthough he thinks me a prepasterous fellow--You must know I am to have\r\nthe honour to open a ball next door to-morrow with lady Mac Manus; and\r\nbeing rusted in my dancing, I was refreshing my memory with a little\r\nexercise; but if I had known there was a sick person below, by Christ!\r\nI would have sooner danced a hornpipe upon my own head, than walk the\r\nsoftest minuet over yours.’--My uncle, who was not a little startled at\r\nhis first appearance, received his compliment with great complacency,\r\ninsisted upon his being seated, thanked him for the honour of his visit,\r\nand reprimanded me for my abrupt expostulation with a gentleman of his\r\nrank and character. Thus tutored, I asked pardon of the knight, who,\r\nforthwith starting up, embraced me so close, that I could hardly\r\nbreathe; and assured me, he loved me as his own soul. At length,\r\nrecollecting his night-cap, he pulled it off in some confusion; and,\r\nwith his bald-pate uncovered, made a thousand apologies to the ladies,\r\nas he retired--At that instant, the Abbey bells, began to ring so\r\nloud, that we could not hear one another speak; and this peal, as\r\nwe afterwards learned, was for the honour of Mr Bullock, an eminent\r\ncowkeeper of Tottenham, who had just arrived at Bath, to drink the\r\nwaters for indigestion. Mr Bramble had not time to make his remarks upon\r\nthe agreeable nature of this serenade, before his ears were saluted with\r\nanother concert that interested him more nearly. Two negroes, belonging\r\nto a Creole gentleman, who lodged in the same house, taking their\r\nstation at a window in the stair-case, about ten feet from our\r\ndining-room door, began to practise upon the French-horn; and being in\r\nthe very first rudiments of execution, produced such discordant sounds,\r\nas might have discomposed the organs of an ass. You may guess what\r\neffect they had upon the irritable nerves of uncle; who, with the most\r\nadmirable expression of splenetic surprize in his countenance, sent\r\nhis man to silence these dreadful blasts, and desire the musicians to\r\npractise in some other place, as they had no right to stand there and\r\ndisturb all the lodgers in the house. Those sable performers, far from\r\ntaking the hint, and withdrawing, treated the messenger with great\r\ninsolence; bidding him carry his compliments to their master, colonel\r\nRigworm, who would give him a proper answer, and a good drubbing into\r\nthe bargain; in the mean time they continued their noise, and even\r\nendeavoured to make it more disagreeable; laughing between whiles, at\r\nthe thoughts of being able to torment their betters with impunity. Our\r\n‘squire, incensed at the additional insult, immediately dispatched the\r\nservant, with his compliments to colonel Rigworm, requesting that\r\nhe would order his blacks to be quiet, as the noise they made was\r\naltogether intolerable--To this message, the Creole colonel replied,\r\nthat his horns had a right to sound on a common staircase; that there\r\nthey should play for his diversion; and that those who did not like the\r\nnoise, might look for lodgings elsewhere. Mr Bramble no sooner received\r\nthis reply, than his eyes began to glisten, his face grew pale, and his\r\nteeth chattered. After a moment’s pause, he slipt on his shoes, without\r\nspeaking a word, or seeming to feel any further disturbance from the\r\ngout in his toes. Then snatching his cane, he opened the door and\r\nproceeded to the place where the black trumpeters were posted. There,\r\nwithout further hesitation, he began to belabour them both; and exerted\r\nhimself with such astonishing vigour and agility, that both their heads\r\nand horns were broken in a twinkling, and they ran howling down stairs\r\nto their master’s parlour-door. The squire, following them half way,\r\ncalled aloud, that the colonel might hear him, ‘Go, rascals, and tell\r\nyour master what I have done; if he thinks himself injured, he knows\r\nwhere to come for satisfaction. As for you, this is but an earnest of\r\nwhat you shall receive, if ever you presume to blow a horn again here,\r\nwhile I stay in the house.’ So saying, he retired to his apartment, in\r\nexpectation of hearing from the West Indian; but the colonel prudently\r\ndeclined any farther prosecution of the dispute. My sister Liddy was\r\nfrighted into a fit, from which she was no sooner recovered, than Mrs\r\nTabitha began a lecture upon patience; which her brother interrupted\r\nwith a most significant grin, ‘True, sister, God increase my patience\r\nand your discretion. I wonder (added he) what sort of sonata we are to\r\nexpect from this overture, in which the devil, that presides over horrid\r\nsounds, hath given us such variations of discord--The trampling of\r\nporters, the creaking and crashing of trunks, the snarling of curs, the\r\nscolding of women, the squeaking and squalling of fiddles and hautboys\r\nout of tune, the bouncing of the Irish baronet over-head, and the\r\nbursting, belching, and brattling of the French-horns in the passage\r\n(not to mention the harmonious peal that still thunders from the Abbey\r\nsteeple) succeeding one another without interruption, like the different\r\nparts of the same concert, have given me such an idea of what a poor\r\ninvalid has to expect in this temple, dedicated to Silence and Repose,\r\nthat I shall certainly shift my quarters to-morrow, and endeavour to\r\neffectuate my retreat before Sir Ulic opens the ball with my lady Mac\r\nManus; a conjunction that bodes me no good.’ This intimation was by no\r\nmeans agreeable to Mrs Tabitha, whose ears were not quite so delicate as\r\nthose of her brother--She said it would be great folly to move from\r\nsuch agreeable lodgings, the moment they were comfortably settled. She\r\nwondered he should be such an enemy to music and mirth. She heard no\r\nnoise but of his own making: it was impossible to manage a family in\r\ndumb-shew. He might harp as long as he pleased upon her scolding; but\r\nshe never scolded, except for his advantage; but he would never be\r\nsatisfied, even tho’f she should sweat blood and water in his service--I\r\nhave a great notion that our aunt, who is now declining into the most\r\ndesperate state of celibacy, had formed some design upon the heart of\r\nSir Ulic Mackilligut, which she feared might be frustrated by our abrupt\r\ndeparture from these lodgings. Her brother, eyeing her askance, ‘Pardon\r\nme, sister (said he) I should be a savage, indeed, were I insensible of\r\nmy own felicity, in having such a mild, complaisant, good-humoured, and\r\nconsiderate companion and housekeeper; but as I have got a weak head,\r\nand my sense of hearing is painfully acute, before I have recourse to\r\nplugs of wool and cotton, I’ll try whether I can’t find another lodging,\r\nwhere I shall have more quiet and less music.’ He accordingly dispatched\r\nhis man upon this service; and next day he found a small house in\r\nMilsham-street, which he hires by the week. Here, at least, we enjoy\r\nconvenience and quiet within doors, as much as Tabby’s temper will\r\nallow; but the squire still complains of flying pains in the stomach\r\nand head, for which he bathes and drinks the waters. He is not so bad,\r\nhowever, but that he goes in person to the pump, the rooms, and the\r\ncoffeehouses; where he picks up continual food for ridicule and satire.\r\nIf I can glean any thing for your amusement, either from his observation\r\nor my own, you shall have it freely, though I am afraid it will poorly\r\ncompensate the trouble of reading these tedious insipid letters of,\r\n\r\nDear Phillips, Yours always, J. MELFORD\r\n\nTo Dr LEWIS. BATH, April 23. DEAR DOCTOR,\r\n\r\nIf I did not know that the exercise of your profession has habituated\r\nyou to the hearing of complaints, I should make a conscience of\r\ntroubling you with my correspondence, which may be truly called the\r\nlamentations of Matthew Bramble. Yet I cannot help thinking I have\r\nsome right to discharge the overflowings of my spleen upon you, whose\r\nprovince it is to remove those disorders that occasioned it; and let\r\nme tell you, it is no small alleviation of my grievances, that I have a\r\nsensible friend, to whom I can communicate my crusty humours, which, by\r\nretention, would grow intolerably acrimonious.\r\n\r\nYou must know, I find nothing but disappointment at Bath; which is\r\nso altered, that I can scarce believe it is the same place that I\r\nfrequented about thirty years ago. Methinks I hear you say, ‘Altered it\r\nis, without all doubt: but then it is altered for the better; a truth\r\nwhich, perhaps, you would own without hesitation, if you yourself was\r\nnot altered for the worse.’ The reflection may, for aught I know, be\r\njust. The inconveniences which I overlooked in the high-day of health,\r\nwill naturally strike with exaggerated impression on the irritable\r\nnerves of an invalid, surprised by premature old age, and shattered with\r\nlong-suffering--But, I believe, you will not deny, that this place,\r\nwhich Nature and Providence seem to have intended as a resource\r\nfrom distemper and disquiet, is become the very centre of racket and\r\ndissipation. Instead of that peace, tranquillity, and ease, so necessary\r\nto those who labour under bad health, weak nerves, and irregular\r\nspirits; here we have nothing but noise, tumult, and hurry; with the\r\nfatigue and slavery of maintaining a ceremonial, more stiff, formal, and\r\noppressive, than the etiquette of a German elector. A national hospital\r\nit may be, but one would imagine that none but lunatics are admitted;\r\nand truly, I will give you leave to call me so, if I stay much longer at\r\nBath.--But I shall take another opportunity to explain my sentiments\r\nat greater length on this subject--I was impatient to see the boasted\r\nimprovements in architecture, for which the upper parts of the town have\r\nbeen so much celebrated and t’other day I made a circuit of all the new\r\nbuildings. The Square, though irregular, is, on the whole, pretty well\r\nlaid out, spacious, open, and airy; and, in my opinion, by far the most\r\nwholesome and agreeable situation in Bath, especially the upper side of\r\nit; but the avenues to it are mean, dirty, dangerous, and indirect. Its\r\ncommunication with the Baths, is through the yard of an inn, where the\r\npoor trembling valetudinarian is carried in a chair, betwixt the heels\r\nof a double row of horses, wincing under the curry-combs of grooms and\r\npostilions, over and above the hazard of being obstructed, or overturned\r\nby the carriages which are continually making their exit or their\r\nentrance--I suppose after some chairmen shall have been maimed, and\r\na few lives lost by those accidents, the corporation will think, in\r\nearnest, about providing a more safe and commodious passage. The Circus\r\nis a pretty bauble, contrived for shew, and looks like Vespasian’s\r\namphitheatre turned outside in. If we consider it in point of\r\nmagnificence, the great number of small doors belonging to the separate\r\nhouses, the inconsiderable height of the different orders, the affected\r\nornaments of the architrave, which are both childish and misplaced,\r\nand the areas projecting into the street, surrounded with iron rails,\r\ndestroy a good part of its effect upon the eye; and, perhaps, we shall\r\nfind it still more defective, if we view it in the light of convenience.\r\nThe figure of each separate dwelling-house, being the segment of a\r\ncircle, must spoil the symmetry of the rooms, by contracting them\r\ntowards the street windows, and leaving a larger sweep in the space\r\nbehind. If, instead of the areas and iron rails, which seem to be of\r\nvery little use, there had been a corridore with arcades all round,\r\nas in Covent-garden, the appearance of the whole would have been more\r\nmagnificent and striking; those arcades would have afforded an agreeable\r\ncovered walk, and sheltered the poor chairmen and their carriages from\r\nthe rain, which is here almost perpetual. At present, the chairs stand\r\nsoaking in the open street, from morning to night, till they become so\r\nmany boxes of wet leather, for the benefit of the gouty and rheumatic,\r\nwho are transported in them from place to place. Indeed this is a\r\nshocking inconvenience that extends over the whole city; and, I am\r\npersuaded, it produces infinite mischief to the delicate and infirm;\r\neven the close chairs, contrived for the sick, by standing in the open\r\nair, have their frize linings impregnated like so many spunges, with the\r\nmoisture of the atmosphere, and those cases of cold vapour must give\r\na charming check to the perspiration of a patient, piping hot from the\r\nBath, with all his pores wide open.\r\n\r\nBut, to return to the Circus; it is inconvenient from its situation, at\r\nso great a distance from all the markets, baths, and places of public\r\nentertainment. The only entrance to it, through Gay-street, is so\r\ndifficult, steep, and slippery, that in wet weather, it must be\r\nexceedingly dangerous, both for those that ride in carriages, and those\r\nthat walk a-foot; and when the street is covered with snow, as it was\r\nfor fifteen days successively this very winter, I don’t see how any\r\nindividual could go either up or down, without the most imminent hazard\r\nof broken bones. In blowing weather, I am told, most of the houses in\r\nthis hill are smothered with smoke, forced down the chimneys, by the\r\ngusts of wind reverberated from the hill behind, which (I apprehend\r\nlikewise) must render the atmosphere here more humid and unwholesome\r\nthan it is in the square below; for the clouds, formed by the constant\r\nevaporation from the baths and rivers in the bottom, will, in their\r\nascent this way, be first attracted and detained by the hill that rises\r\nclose behind the Circus, and load the air with a perpetual succession of\r\nvapours: this point, however, may be easily ascertained by means of an\r\nhygrometer, or a paper of salt of tartar exposed to the action of\r\nthe atmosphere. The same artist who planned the Circus, has likewise\r\nprojected a Crescent; when that is finished, we shall probably have a\r\nStar; and those who are living thirty years hence, may, perhaps, see\r\nall the signs of the Zodiac exhibited in architecture at Bath. These,\r\nhowever fantastical, are still designs that denote some ingenuity and\r\nknowledge in the architect; but the rage of building has laid hold on\r\nsuch a number of adventurers, that one sees new houses starting up in\r\nevery out-let and every corner of Bath; contrived without judgment,\r\nexecuted without solidity, and stuck together with so little regard\r\nto plan and propriety, that the different lines of the new rows and\r\nbuildings interfere with, and intersect one another in every different\r\nangle of conjunction. They look like the wreck of streets and squares\r\ndisjointed by an earthquake, which hath broken the ground into a variety\r\nof holes and hillocks; or as if some Gothic devil had stuffed them\r\naltogether in a bag, and left them to stand higgledy piggledy, just as\r\nchance directed. What sort of a monster Bath will become in a few years,\r\nwith those growing excrescences, may be easily conceived: but the want\r\nof beauty and proportion is not the worst effect of these new mansions;\r\nthey are built so slight, with the soft crumbling stone found in this\r\nneighbourhood, that I shall never sleep quietly in one of them, when\r\nit blowed (as the sailors say) a cap-full of wind; and, I am persuaded,\r\nthat my hind, Roger Williams, or any man of equal strength, would be\r\nable to push his foot through the strongest part of their walls, without\r\nany great exertion of his muscles. All these absurdities arise from the\r\ngeneral tide of luxury, which hath overspread the nation, and swept\r\naway all, even the very dregs of the people. Every upstart of fortune,\r\nharnessed in the trappings of the mode, presents himself at Bath, as in\r\nthe very focus of observation--Clerks and factors from the East Indies,\r\nloaded with the spoil of plundered provinces; planters, negro-drivers,\r\nand hucksters from our American plantations, enriched they know not\r\nhow; agents, commissaries, and contractors, who have fattened, in two\r\nsuccessive wars, on the blood of the nation; usurers, brokers, and\r\njobbers of every kind; men of low birth, and no breeding, have found\r\nthemselves suddenly translated into a state of affluence, unknown to\r\nformer ages; and no wonder that their brains should be intoxicated with\r\npride, vanity, and presumption. Knowing no other criterion of greatness,\r\nbut the ostentation of wealth, they discharge their affluence without\r\ntaste or conduct, through every channel of the most absurd extravagance;\r\nand all of them hurry to Bath, because here, without any further\r\nqualification, they can mingle with the princes and nobles of the land.\r\nEven the wives and daughters of low tradesmen, who, like shovel-nosed\r\nsharks, prey upon the blubber of those uncouth whales of fortune, are\r\ninfected with the same rage of displaying their importance; and the\r\nslightest indisposition serves them for a pretext to insist upon being\r\nconveyed to Bath, where they may hobble country-dances and cotillons\r\namong lordlings, squires, counsellors, and clergy. These delicate\r\ncreatures from Bedfordbury, Butcher-row, Crutched-friers, and\r\nBotolph-lane, cannot breathe in the gross air of the Lower Town, or\r\nconform to the vulgar rules of a common lodging-house; the husband,\r\ntherefore, must provide an entire house, or elegant apartments in the\r\nnew buildings. Such is the composition of what is called the fashionable\r\ncompany at Bath; where a very inconsiderable proportion of genteel\r\npeople are lost in a mob of impudent plebeians, who have neither\r\nunderstanding nor judgment, nor the least idea of propriety and decorum;\r\nand seem to enjoy nothing so much as an opportunity of insulting their\r\nbetters.\r\n\r\nThus the number of people, and the number of houses continue to\r\nincrease; and this will ever be the case, till the streams that swell\r\nthis irresistible torrent of folly and extravagance, shall either be\r\nexhausted, or turned into other channels, by incidents and events which\r\nI do not pretend to foresee. This, I own, is a subject on which I cannot\r\nwrite with any degree of patience; for the mob is a monster I never\r\ncould abide, either in its head, tail, midriff, or members; I detest the\r\nwhole of it, as a mass of ignorance, presumption, malice and brutality;\r\nand, in this term of reprobation, I include, without respect of rank,\r\nstation, or quality, all those of both sexes, who affect its manners,\r\nand court its society.\r\n\r\nBut I have written till my fingers are crampt, and my nausea begins to\r\nreturn--By your advice, I sent to London a few days ago for half a pound\r\nof Gengzeng; though I doubt much, whether that which comes from America\r\nis equally efficacious with what is brought from the East Indies. Some\r\nyears ago a friend of mine paid sixteen guineas for two ounces of\r\nit; and, in six months after, it was sold in the same shop for five\r\nshillings the pound. In short, we live in a vile world of fraud and\r\nsophistication; so that I know nothing of equal value with the genuine\r\nfriendship of a sensible man; a rare jewel! which I cannot help thinking\r\nmyself in possession of, while I repeat the old declaration, that I am,\r\nas usual,\r\n\r\nDear Lewis, Your affectionate M. BRAMBLE,\r\n\r\nAfter having been agitated in a short hurricane, on my first arrival,\r\nI have taken a small house in Milsham-street, where I am tolerably well\r\nlodged, for five guineas a week. I was yesterday at the Pump-room, and\r\ndrank about a pint of water, which seems to agree with my stomach; and\r\nto-morrow morning I shall bathe, for the first time; so that in a few\r\nposts you may expect farther trouble; mean while, I am glad to find that\r\nthe inoculation has succeeded so well with poor Joyce, and that her face\r\nwill be but little marked. If my friend Sir Thomas was a single man,\r\nI would not trust such a handsome wench in his family; but as I have\r\nrecommended her, in a particular manner, to the protection of lady G--,\r\nwho is one of the best women in the world, she may go thither without\r\nhesitation as soon as she is quite recovered and fit for service--Let\r\nher mother have money to provide her with necessaries, and she may ride\r\nbehind her brother on Bucks; but you must lay strong injunctions\r\non Jack, to take particular care of the trusty old veteran, who has\r\nfaithfully earned his present ease by his past services.\r\n\nTo Miss WILLIS at Gloucester. BATH, April 26. MY DEAREST COMPANION,\r\n\r\nThe pleasure I received from yours, which came to hand yesterday, is\r\nnot to be expressed. Love and friendship are, without doubt, charming\r\npassions; which absence serves only to heighten and improve. Your kind\r\npresent of the garnet bracelets, I shall keep as carefully as I preserve\r\nmy own life; and I beg you will accept, in return, my heart-housewife,\r\nwith the tortoise-shell memorandum-book, as a trifling pledge of my\r\nunalterable affection.\r\n\r\nBath is to me a new world--All is gayety, good-humour, and diversion.\r\nThe eye is continually entertained with the splendour of dress and\r\nequipage; and the ear with the sound of coaches, chairs, and other\r\ncarriages. The merry bells ring round, from morn till night. Then we\r\nare welcomed by the city-waits in our own lodgings; we have music in the\r\nPump-room every morning, cotillons every forenoon in the rooms, balls\r\ntwice a week, and concerts every other night, besides private assemblies\r\nand parties without number--As soon as we were settled in lodgings, we\r\nwere visited by the Master of the Ceremonies; a pretty little gentleman,\r\nso sweet, so fine, so civil, and polite, that in our country he might\r\npass for the prince of Wales; then he talks so charmingly, both in verse\r\nand prose, that you would be delighted to hear him discourse; for you\r\nmust know he is a great writer, and has got five tragedies ready for the\r\nstage. He did us the favour to dine with us, by my uncle’s invitation;\r\nand next day squired my aunt and me to every part of Bath; which, to be\r\nsure, is an earthly paradise. The Square, the Circus, and the Parades,\r\nput you in mind of the sumptuous palaces represented in prints and\r\npictures; and the new buildings, such as Princes-row, Harlequin’s-row,\r\nBladud’s-row, and twenty other rows, look like so many enchanted\r\ncastles, raised on hanging terraces.\r\n\r\nAt eight in the morning, we go in dishabille to the Pump-room which is\r\ncrowded like a Welsh fair; and there you see the highest quality,\r\nand the lowest trades folks, jostling each other, without ceremony,\r\nhail-fellow well-met. The noise of the music playing in the gallery,\r\nthe heat and flavour of such a crowd, and the hum and buz of their\r\nconversation, gave me the head-ach and vertigo the first day; but,\r\nafterwards, all these things became familiar, and even agreeable.--Right\r\nunder the Pump-room windows is the King’s Bath; a huge cistern, where\r\nyou see the patients up to their necks in hot water. The ladies wear\r\njackets and petticoats of brown linen with chip hats, in which they\r\nfix their handkerchiefs to wipe the sweat from their faces; but, truly,\r\nwhether it is owing to the steam that surrounds them, or the heat of the\r\nwater, or the nature of the dress, or to all these causes together, they\r\nlook so flushed, and so frightful, that I always turn my eyes another\r\nway--My aunt, who says every person of fashion should make her\r\nappearance in the bath, as well as in the abbey church, contrived a cap\r\nwith cherry-coloured ribbons to suit her complexion, and obliged Win to\r\nattend her yesterday morning in the water. But, really, her eyes were so\r\nred, that they made mine water as I viewed her from the Pump-room; and\r\nas for poor Win, who wore a hat trimmed with blue, what betwixt her wan\r\ncomplexion and her fear, she looked like the ghost of some pale maiden,\r\nwho had drowned herself for love. When she came out of the bath, she\r\ntook assafoetida drops, and was fluttered all day; so that we could\r\nhardly keep her from going into hysterics: but her mistress says it will\r\ndo her good; and poor Win curtsies, with the tears in her eyes. For\r\nmy part, I content myself with drinking about half a pint of the water\r\nevery morning.\r\n\r\nThe pumper, with his wife and servant, attend within a bar; and the\r\nglasses, of different sizes, stand ranged in order before them, so you\r\nhave nothing to do but to point at that which you choose, and it is\r\nfilled immediately, hot and sparkling from the pump. It is the only\r\nhot water I could ever drink, without being sick--Far from having that\r\neffect, it is rather agreeable to the taste, grateful to the stomach,\r\nand reviving to the spirits. You cannot imagine what wonderful cures it\r\nperforms--My uncle began with it the other day; but he made wry faces in\r\ndrinking, and I’m afraid he will leave it off--The first day we came to\r\nBath, he fell into a violent passion; beat two black-a-moors, and I was\r\nafraid he would have fought with their master; but the stranger proved\r\na peaceable man. To be sure, the gout had got into his head, as my aunt\r\nobserved; but, I believe, his passion drove it away; for he has been\r\nremarkably well ever since. It is a thousand pities he should ever be\r\ntroubled with that ugly distemper; for, when he is free from pain, he is\r\nthe best tempered man upon earth; so gentle, so generous, so charitable,\r\nthat every body loves him; and so good to me, in particular, that I\r\nshall never be able to shew the deep sense I have of his tenderness and\r\naffection.\r\n\r\nHard by the Pump-room, is a coffee-house for the ladies; but my aunt\r\nsays, young girls are not admitted, insomuch as the conversation\r\nturns upon politics, scandal, philosophy, and other subjects above\r\nour capacity; but we are allowed to accompany them to the booksellers’\r\nshops, which are charming places of resort; where we read novels, plays,\r\npamphlets, and newspapers, for so small a subscription as a crown a\r\nquarter; and in these offices of intelligence (as my brother calls them)\r\nall the reports of the day, and all the private transactions of the\r\nBath, are first entered and discussed. From the bookseller’s shop, we\r\nmake a tour through the milliners and toymen; and commonly stop at Mr\r\nGill’s, the pastry-cook, to take a jelly, a tart, or a small bason of\r\nvermicelli. There is, moreover, another place of entertainment on the\r\nother side of the water, opposite to the Grove, to which the company\r\ncross over in a boat--It is called Spring-garden; a sweet retreat,\r\nlaid out in walks and ponds, and parterres of flowers; and there is\r\na long-room for breakfasting and dancing. As the situation is low and\r\ndamp, and the season has been remarkably wet, my uncle won’t suffer me\r\nto go thither, lest I should catch cold: but my aunt says it is all a\r\nvulgar prejudice; and, to be sure, a great many gentlemen and ladies of\r\nIreland frequent the place, without seeming to be the worse for it. They\r\nsay, dancing at Spring-gardens, when the air is moist, is recommended to\r\nthem as an excellent cure for the rheumatism. I have been twice at\r\nthe play; where, notwithstanding the excellence of the performers, the\r\ngayety of the company, and the decorations of the theatre, which are\r\nvery fine, I could not help reflecting, with a sigh, upon our poor\r\nhomely representations at Gloucester--But this, in confidence to my dear\r\nWillis--You know my heart, and will excuse its weakness.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the great scenes of entertainment at Bath, are the two\r\npublic rooms; where the company meet alternately every evening. They are\r\nspacious, lofty, and, when lighted up, appear very striking. They are\r\ngenerally crowded with well-dressed people, who drink tea in separate\r\nparties, play at cards, walk, or sit and chat together, just as they are\r\ndisposed. Twice a-week there is a ball; the expence of which is defrayed\r\nby a voluntary subscription among the gentlemen; and every subscriber\r\nhas three tickets. I was there Friday last with my aunt, under the care\r\nof my brother, who is a subscriber; and Sir Ulic Mackilligut recommended\r\nhis nephew, captain O Donaghan, to me as a partner; but Jery excused\r\nhimself, by saying I had got the head-ach; and, indeed, it was really\r\nso, though I can’t imagine how he knew it. The place was so hot, and the\r\nsmell so different from what we are used to in the country, that I was\r\nquite feverish when we came away. Aunt says it is the effect of a vulgar\r\nconstitution, reared among woods and mountains; and, that as I become\r\naccustomed to genteel company, it will wear off.--Sir Ulic was very\r\ncomplaisant, made her a great many high-flown compliments; and, when\r\nwe retired, handed her with great ceremony to her chair. The captain, I\r\nbelieve, would have done me the same favour; but my brother seeing him\r\nadvance, took me under his arm, and wished him good night. The Captain\r\nis a pretty man, to be sure; tall and strait, and well made; with\r\nlight-grey eyes, and a Roman nose; but there is a certain boldness in\r\nhis look and manner, that puts one out of countenance--But I am afraid\r\nI have put you out of all patience with this long unconnected scrawl;\r\nwhich I shall therefore conclude, with assuring you, that neither Bath,\r\nnor London, nor all the diversions of life, shall ever be able to efface\r\nthe idea of my dear Letty, from the heart of her ever affectionate\r\n\r\nLYDIA MELFORD\r\n\nTo Mrs MARY JONES, at Brambleton-hall.\r\n\r\nDEAR MOLLY JONES,\r\n\r\nHeaving got a frank, I now return your fever, which I received by Mr\r\nHiggins, at the Hot Well, together with the stockings, which his wife\r\nfooted for me; but now they are of no survice. No body wears such things\r\nin this place--O Molly! you that live in the country have no deception\r\nof our doings at Bath. Here is such dressing, and fidling, and dancing,\r\nand gadding, and courting and plotting--O gracious! if God had not\r\ngiven me a good stock of discretion, what a power of things might not\r\nI reveal, consarning old mistress and young mistress; Jews with beards\r\nthat were no Jews; but handsome Christians, without a hair upon their\r\nsin, strolling with spectacles, to get speech of Miss Liddy. But she’s\r\na dear sweet soul, as innocent as the child unborn. She has tould me all\r\nher inward thoughts, and disclosed her passion for Mr Wilson; and that’s\r\nnot his name neither; and thof he acted among the player-men, he is meat\r\nfor their masters; and she has gi’en me her yallow trollopea; which Mrs\r\nDrab, the mantymaker, says will look very well when it is scowred and\r\nsmoaked with silfur--You knows as how, yallow fitts my fizzogmony. God\r\nhe knows what havock I shall make among the mail sex, when I make my\r\nfirst appearance in this killing collar, with a full soot of gaze, as\r\ngood as new, that I bought last Friday of madam Friponeau, the French\r\nmullaner--Dear girl, I have seen all the fine shews of Bath; the Prades,\r\nthe Squires, and the Circlis, the Crashit, the Hottogon, and Bloody\r\nBuildings, and Harry King’s row; and I have been twice in the Bath with\r\nmistress, and na’r a smoak upon our backs, hussy. The first time I was\r\nmortally afraid, and flustered all day; and afterwards made believe that\r\nI had got the heddick; but mistress said, if I didn’t go I should take\r\na dose of bumtaffy; and so remembering how it worked Mrs Gwyllim a\r\npennorth, I chose rather to go again with her into the Bath, and then I\r\nmet with an axident. I dropt my petticoat, and could not get it up from\r\nthe bottom.--But what did that signify; they mought laff but they could\r\nsee nothing; for I was up to the sin in water. To be sure, it threw me\r\ninto such a gumbustion, that I know not what I said, nor what I did, nor\r\nhow they got me out, and rapt me in a blanket--Mrs Tabitha scoulded a\r\nlittle when we got home; but she knows as I know what’s what Ah Laud\r\nhelp you!--There is Sir Yury Micligut, of Balnaclinch, in the cunty of\r\nKalloway--I took down the name from his gentleman, Mr 0 Frizzle, and he\r\nhas got an estate of fifteen hundred a year--I am sure he is both rich\r\nand generous--But you nose, Molly, I was always famous for keeping\r\nsecrets; and so he was very safe in trusting me with his flegm for\r\nmistress; which, to be sure is very honourable; for Mr O Frizzle assures\r\nme, he values not her portion a brass varthing--And, indeed, what’s poor\r\nten thousand pounds to a Baron Knight of his fortune? and, truly, I told\r\nMr 0 Frizzle that was all she had trust to--As for John Thomas, he’s\r\na morass fellor--I vow, I thought he would a fit with Mr 0 Frizzle,\r\nbecause he axed me to dance with him at Spring Garden--But God he knows\r\nI have no thoughts eyther of wan or t’other.\r\n\r\nAs for house news, the worst is, Chowder has fallen off greatly from\r\nhis stomick--He eats nothing but white meats, and not much of that;\r\nand wheezes, and seems to be much bloated. The doctors think he\r\nis threatened with a dropsy--Parson Marrofat, who has got the same\r\ndisorder, finds great benefit from the waters; but Chowder seems to like\r\nthem no better than the squire; and mistress says, if his case don’t\r\ntake a favourable turn, she will sartinly carry him to Aberga’ny, to\r\ndrink goat’s whey--To be sure, the poor dear honymil is lost for want of\r\naxercise; for which reason, she intends to give him an airing once a-day\r\nupon the Downs, in a post-chaise--I have already made very creditable\r\nconnexions in this here place; where, to be sure, we have the very\r\nsquintasense of satiety--Mrs Patcher, my lady Kilmacullock’s woman, and\r\nI are sworn sisters. She has shewn me all her secrets, and learned me to\r\nwash gaze, and refrash rusty silks and bumbeseens, by boiling them with\r\nwinegar, chamberlye, and stale beer. My short sack and apron luck as\r\ngood as new from the shop, and my pumpydoor as fresh as a rose, by\r\nthe help of turtle-water--But this is all Greek and Latten to you,\r\nMolly--If we should come to Aberga’ny, you’ll be within a day’s ride of\r\nus; and then we shall see wan another, please God--If not, remember\r\nme in your prayers, as I shall do by you in mine; and take care of my\r\nkitten, and give my kind sarvice to Sall; and this is all at present,\r\nfrom your beloved friend and sarvent,\r\n\r\nW. JENKINS BATH, April 26.\r\n\nTo Mrs GWYLLIM, house-keeper at Brambleton-hall.\r\n\r\nI am astonished that Dr Lewis should take upon him to give away\r\nAlderney, without my privity and concurrants--What signifies my\r\nbrother’s order? My brother is little better than Noncompush. He would\r\ngive away the shirt off his back, and the teeth out of his head; nay, as\r\nfor that matter; he would have ruinated the family with his ridiculous\r\ncharities, if it had not been for my four quarters--What between his\r\nwillfullness and his waste, his trumps, and his frenzy, I lead the life\r\nof an indented slave. Alderney gave four gallons a-day, ever since the\r\ncalf was sent to market. There is so much milk out of my dairy, and the\r\npress must stand still: but I won’t loose a cheese pairing; and the milk\r\nshall be made good, if the sarvents should go without butter. If they\r\nmust needs have butter, let them make it of sheep’s milk; but then my\r\nwool will suffer for want of grace; so that I must be a loser on all\r\nsides. Well, patience is like a stout Welsh poney; it bears a great\r\ndeal, and trots a great way; but it will tire at the long run. Before\r\nits long, perhaps I may shew Matt, that I was not born to be the\r\nhousehold drudge to my dying day--Gwyn rites from Crickhowel, that the\r\nprice of flannel is fallen three-farthings an ell; and that’s another\r\ngood penny out of my pocket. When I go to market to sell, my commodity\r\nstinks; but when I want to buy the commonest thing, the owner pricks\r\nit up under my nose; and it can’t be had for love nor money--I think\r\neverything runs cross at Brambleton-hall--You say the gander has broke\r\nthe eggs; which is a phinumenon I don’t understand: for when the fox\r\ncarried off the old goose last year, he took her place, and hatched the\r\neggs, and partected the goslings like a tender parent--Then you tell me\r\nthe thunder has soured two barrels of beer in the seller. But how the\r\nthunder should get there, when the seller was double-locked, I can’t\r\ncomprehend. Howsomever, I won’t have the beer thrown out, till I see it\r\nwith my own eyes. Perhaps, it will recover--At least it will serve for\r\nvinegar to the servants.--You may leave off the fires in my brother’s\r\nchamber and mine, as it is unsartain when we return.--I hope, Gwyllim,\r\nyou’ll take care there is no waste; and have an eye to the maids, and\r\nkeep them to their spinning. I think they may go very well without beer\r\nin hot weather--it serves only to inflame the blood, and set them\r\na-gog after the men. Water will make them fair and keep them cool and\r\ntamperit. Don’t forget to put up in the portmantel, that cums with\r\nWilliams, along with my riding-habit, hat, and feather, the viol of purl\r\nwater, and the tincktur for my stomach; being as how I am much troubled\r\nwith flutterencies. This is all at present, from\r\n\r\nYours, TABITHA BRAMBLE BATH, April 26.\r\n\nTo Dr LEWIS.\r\n\r\nDEAR DICK,\r\n\r\nI have done with the waters; therefore your advice comes a day too late\r\nI grant that physic is no mystery of your making. I know it is a mystery\r\nin its own nature; and, like other mysteries, requires a strong gulp of\r\nfaith to make it go down--Two days ago, I went into the King’s Bath,\r\nby the advice of our friend Ch--, in order to clear the strainer of the\r\nskin, for the benefit of a free perspiration; and the first object that\r\nsaluted my eye, was a child full of scrophulous ulcers, carried in the\r\narms of one of the guides, under the very noses of the bathers. I was\r\nso shocked at the sight, that I retired immediately with indignation\r\nand disgust--Suppose the matter of those ulcers, floating on the water,\r\ncomes in contact with my skin, when the pores are all open, I would ask\r\nyou what must be the consequence?--Good Heaven, the very thought makes\r\nmy blood run cold! we know not what sores may be running into the water\r\nwhile we are bathing, and what sort of matter we may thus imbibe; the\r\nking’s-evil, the scurvy, the cancer, and the pox; and, no doubt, the\r\nheat will render the virus the more volatile and penetrating. To purify\r\nmyself from all such contamination, I went to the duke of Kingston’s\r\nprivate Bath, and there I was almost suffocated for want of free air;\r\nthe place was so small, and the steam so stifling.\r\n\r\nAfter all, if the intention is no more than to wash the skin, I\r\nam convinced that simple element is more effectual than any water\r\nimpregnated with salt and iron; which, being astringent, will certainly\r\ncontract the pores, and leave a kind of crust upon the surface of the\r\nbody. But I am now as much afraid of drinking, as of bathing; for, after\r\na long conversation with the Doctor, about the construction of the\r\npump and the cistern, it is very far from being clear with me, that the\r\npatients in the Pump-room don’t swallow the scourings of the bathers. I\r\ncan’t help suspecting, that there is, or may be, some regurgitation from\r\nthe bath into the cistern of the pump. In that case, what a delicate\r\nbeveridge is every day quaffed by the drinkers; medicated with the sweat\r\nand dirt, and dandriff; and the abominable discharges of various kinds,\r\nfrom twenty different diseased bodies, parboiling in the kettle below.\r\nIn order to avoid this filthy composition, I had recourse to the spring\r\nthat supplies the private baths on the Abbey-green; but I at once\r\nperceived something extraordinary in the taste and smell; and, upon\r\ninquiry, I find that the Roman baths in this quarter, were found covered\r\nby an old burying ground, belonging to the Abbey; through which, in all\r\nprobability, the water drains in its passage; so that as we drink the\r\ndecoction of living bodies at the Pump-room, we swallow the strainings\r\nof rotten bones and carcasses at the private bath. I vow to God, the\r\nvery idea turns my stomach! Determined, as I am, against any farther use\r\nof the Bath waters, this consideration would give me little disturbance,\r\nif I could find any thing more pure, or less pernicious, to quench my\r\nthirst; but, although the natural springs of excellent water are seen\r\ngushing spontaneous on every side, from the hills that surround us, the\r\ninhabitants, in general, make use of well-water, so impregnated with\r\nnitre, or alum, or some other villainous mineral, that it is equally\r\nungrateful to the taste, and mischievous to the constitution. It must\r\nbe owned, indeed, that here, in Milsham-street, we have a precarious and\r\nscanty supply from the hill; which is collected in an open bason in\r\nthe Circus, liable to be defiled with dead dogs, cats, rats, and every\r\nspecies of nastiness, which the rascally populace may throw into it,\r\nfrom mere wantonness and brutality. Well, there is no nation that drinks\r\nso hoggishly as the English.\r\n\r\nWhat passes for wine among us, is not the juice of the grape. It is an\r\nadulterous mixture, brewed up of nauseous ingredients, by dunces,\r\nwho are bunglers in the art of poison-making; and yet we, and our\r\nforefathers, are and have been poisoned by this cursed drench, without\r\ntaste or flavour--The only genuine and wholesome beveridge in England,\r\nis London porter, and Dorchester table-beer; but as for your ale and\r\nyour gin, your cyder and your perry, and all the trashy family of\r\nmade wines, I detest them as infernal compositions, contrived for the\r\ndestruction of the human species--But what have I to do with the human\r\nspecies? except a very few friends, I care not if the whole was--.\r\n\r\nHeark ye, Lewis, my misanthropy increases every day--The longer I\r\nlive, I find the folly and the fraud of mankind grow more and more\r\nintolerable--I wish I had not come from Brambletonhall; after having\r\nlived in solitude so long, I cannot bear the hurry and impertinence of\r\nthe multitude; besides, every thing is sophisticated in these crowded\r\nplaces. Snares are laid for our lives in every thing we eat or drink:\r\nthe very air we breathe, is loaded with contagion. We cannot even\r\nsleep, without risque of infection. I say, infection--This place is\r\nthe rendezvous of the diseased--You won’t deny, that many diseases are\r\ninfectious; even the consumption itself, is highly infectious. When a\r\nperson dies of it in Italy, the bed and bedding are destroyed; the other\r\nfurniture is exposed to the weather and the apartment white-washed,\r\nbefore it is occupied by any other living soul. You’ll allow, that\r\nnothing receives infection sooner, or retains it longer, than blankets,\r\nfeather-beds, and matrasses--‘Sdeath! how do I know what miserable\r\nobjects have been stewing in the bed where I now lie!--I wonder, Dick,\r\nyou did not put me in mind of sending for my own matrasses--But, if I\r\nhad not been an ass, I should not have needed a remembrancer--There is\r\nalways some plaguy reflection that rises up in judgment against me, and\r\nruffles my spirits--Therefore, let us change the subject.\r\n\r\nI have other reasons for abridging my stay at Bath--You know sister\r\nTabby’s complexion--If Mrs Tabitha Bramble had been of any other race,\r\nI should certainly have considered her as the most--. But, the truth\r\nis, she has found means to interest my affection; or, rather, she is\r\nbeholden to the force of prejudice, commonly called the ties of\r\nblood. Well, this amiable maiden has actually commenced a flirting\r\ncorrespondence with an Irish baronet of sixty-five. His name is Sir Ulic\r\nMackilligut. He is said to be much out at elbows; and, I believe, has\r\nreceived false intelligence with respect to her fortune. Be that as\r\nit may, the connexion is exceedingly ridiculous, and begins already\r\nto excite whispers. For my part, I have no intention to dispute her\r\nfree-agency; though I shall fall upon some expedient to undeceive her\r\nparamour, as to the point which he has principally in view. But I don’t\r\nthink her conduct is a proper example for Liddy, who has also attracted\r\nthe notice of some coxcombs in the Rooms; and Jery tells me, he suspects\r\na strapping fellow, the knight’s nephew, of some design upon the girl’s\r\nheart. I shall, therefore, keep a strict eye over her aunt and her,\r\nand even shift the scene, if I find the matter grow more serious--You\r\nperceive what an agreeable task it must be, to a man of my kidney, to\r\nhave the cure of such souls as these.--But, hold, You shall not have\r\nanother peevish word (till the next occasion) from\r\n\r\nYours, MATT. BRAMBLE BATH, April 28.\r\n\nTo Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of Jesus college, Oxon.\r\n\r\nDEAR KNIGHT,\r\n\r\nI think those people are unreasonable, who complain that Bath is a\r\ncontracted circle, in which the same dull scenes perpetually revolve,\r\nwithout variation--I am, on the contrary, amazed to find so small a\r\nplace so crowded with entertainment and variety. London itself can\r\nhardly exhibit one species of diversion, to which we have not something\r\nanalogous at Bath, over and above those singular advantages that are\r\npeculiar to the place. Here, for example, a man has daily opportunities\r\nof seeing the most remarkable characters of the community. He sees\r\nthem in their natural attitudes and true colours; descended from their\r\npedestals, and divested of their formal draperies, undisguised by art\r\nand affectation--Here we have ministers of state, judges, generals,\r\nbishops, projectors, philosophers, wits, poets, players, chemists,\r\nfiddlers, and buffoons. If he makes any considerable stay in the place,\r\nhe is sure of meeting with some particular friend, whom he did not\r\nexpect to see; and to me there is nothing more agreeable than such\r\ncasual reencounters. Another entertainment, peculiar to Bath, arises\r\nfrom the general mixture of all degrees assembled in our public\r\nrooms, without distinction of rank or fortune. This is what my uncle\r\nreprobates, as a monstrous jumble of heterogeneous principles; a vile\r\nmob of noise and impertinence, without decency or subordination. But\r\nthis chaos is to me a source of infinite amusement.\r\n\r\nI was extremely diverted last ball-night to see the Master of the\r\nCeremonies leading, with great solemnity, to the upper end of the room,\r\nan antiquated Abigail, dressed in her lady’s cast-clothes; whom he (I\r\nsuppose) mistook for some countess just arrived at the Bath. The\r\nball was opened by a Scotch lord, with a mulatto heiress from St\r\nChristopher’s; and the gay colonel Tinsel danced all the evening\r\nwith the daughter of an eminent tinman from the borough of Southwark.\r\nYesterday morning, at the Pump-room, I saw a broken-winded\r\nWapping landlady squeeze through a circle of peers, to salute her\r\nbrandy-merchant, who stood by the window, propped upon crutches; and a\r\nparalytic attorney of Shoe-lane, in shuffling up to the bar, kicked the\r\nshins of the chancellor of England, while his lordship, in a cut bob,\r\ndrank a glass of water at the pump. I cannot account for my being\r\npleased with these incidents, any other way, than by saying they are\r\ntruly ridiculous in their own nature, and serve to heighten the humour\r\nin the farce of life, which I am determined to enjoy as long as I can.\r\n\r\nThose follies, that move my uncle’s spleen, excite my laughter. He is\r\nas tender as a man without a skin; who cannot bear the slightest touch\r\nwithout flinching. What tickles another would give him torment; and\r\nyet he has what we may call lucid intervals, when he is remarkably\r\nfacetious--Indeed, I never knew a hypochondriac so apt to be infected\r\nwith good-humour. He is the most risible misanthrope I ever met with.\r\nA lucky joke, or any ludicrous incident, will set him a-laughing\r\nimmoderately, even in one of his most gloomy paroxysms; and, when the\r\nlaugh is over, he will curse his own imbecility. In conversing with\r\nstrangers, he betrays no marks of disquiet--He is splenetic with his\r\nfamiliars only; and not even with them, while they keep his attention\r\nemployed; but when his spirits are not exerted externally, they seem\r\nto recoil and prey upon himself--He has renounced the waters with\r\nexecration; but he begins to find a more efficacious, and, certainly,\r\na much more palatable remedy in the pleasures of society. He has\r\ndiscovered some old friends, among the invalids of Bath; and, in\r\nparticular, renewed his acquaintance with the celebrated James Quin, who\r\ncertainly did not come here to drink water. You cannot doubt, but that I\r\nhad the strongest curiosity to know this original; and it was gratified\r\nby Mr Bramble, who has had him twice at our house to dinner.\r\n\r\nSo far as I am able to judge, Quin’s character is rather more\r\nrespectable than it has been generally represented. His bon mots are in\r\nevery witling’s mouth; but many of them have a rank flavour, which one\r\nwould be apt to think was derived from a natural grossness of idea.\r\nI suspect, however, that justice has not been done the author, by the\r\ncollectors of those Quiniana; who have let the best of them slip through\r\ntheir fingers, and only retained such as were suited to the taste and\r\norgans of the multitude. How far he may relax in his hours of jollity, I\r\ncannot pretend to say; but his general conversation is conducted by the\r\nnicest rules of Propriety; and Mr James Quin is, certainly, one of the\r\nbest bred men in the kingdom. He is not only a most agreeable companion\r\nbut (as I am credibly informed) a very honest man; highly susceptible\r\nof friendship, warm, steady, and even generous in his attachments,\r\ndisdaining flattery, and incapable of meanness and dissimulation. Were I\r\nto judge, however, from Quin’s eye alone, I should take him to be proud,\r\ninsolent, and cruel. There is something remarkably severe and forbidding\r\nin his aspect; and, I have been told, he was ever disposed to insult his\r\ninferiors and dependants.--Perhaps that report has influenced my opinion\r\nof his looks--You know we are the fools of prejudice. Howsoever that may\r\nbe, I have as yet seen nothing but his favourable side, and my uncle,\r\nwho frequently confers with him, in a corner, declares he is one of the\r\nmost sensible men he ever knew--He seems to have a reciprocal regard for\r\nold Squaretoes, whom he calls by the familiar name of Matthew, and often\r\nreminds of their old tavern-adventures: on the other hand, Matthew’s\r\neyes sparkle whenever Quin makes his appearance--Let him be never so\r\njarring and discordant, Quin puts him in tune; and, like treble and bass\r\nin the same concert, they make excellent music together--. T’other day,\r\nthe conversation turning upon Shakespeare, I could not help saying, with\r\nsome emotion, that I would give an hundred guineas to see Mr Quin act\r\nthe part of Falstaff; upon which, turning to me with a smile, ‘And I\r\nwould give a thousand, young gentleman (said he) that I could gratify\r\nyour longing.’ My uncle and he are perfectly agreed in their estimate of\r\nlife; which Quin says, would stink in his nostrils, if he did not steep\r\nit in claret.\r\n\r\nI want to see this phenomenon in his cups; and have almost prevailed\r\nupon uncle to give him a small turtle at the Bear. In the mean time, I\r\nmust entertain you with an incident, that seems to confirm the judgment\r\nof those two cynic philosophers. I took the liberty to differ in opinion\r\nfrom Mr Bramble, when he observed, that the mixture of people in the\r\nentertainments of this place was destructive of all order and urbanity;\r\nthat it rendered the plebeians insufferably arrogant and troublesome,\r\nand vulgarized the deportment and sentiments of those who moved in the\r\nupper spheres of life. He said such a preposterous coalition would bring\r\nus into contempt with all our neighbours; and was worse, in fact, than\r\ndebasing the gold coin of the nation. I argued, on the contrary, that\r\nthose plebeians who discovered such eagerness to imitate the dress and\r\nequipage of their superiors, would likewise, in time, adopt their maxims\r\nand their manners, be polished by their conversation, and refined by\r\ntheir example; but when I appealed to Mr Quin, and asked if he did not\r\nthink that such an unreserved mixture would improve the whole mass? ‘Yes\r\n(said he) as a plate of marmalade would improve a pan of sirreverence.’\r\n\r\nI owned I was not much conversant in high-life, but I had seen what were\r\ncalled polite assemblies in London and elsewhere; that those of Bath\r\nseemed to be as decent as any; and that, upon the whole, the individuals\r\nthat composed it, would not be found deficient in good manners and\r\ndecorum. ‘But let us have recourse to experience (said I)--Jack Holder,\r\nwho was intended for a parson, has succeeded to an estate of two\r\nthousand a year, by the death of his elder brother. He is now at the\r\nBath, driving about in a phaeton and four, with French horns. He has\r\ntreated with turtle and claret at all the taverns in Bath and Bristol,\r\ntill his guests are gorged with good chear: he has bought a dozen suits\r\nof fine clothes, by the advice of the Master of the Ceremonies, under\r\nwhose tuition he has entered himself. He has lost hundreds at billiards\r\nto sharpers, and taken one of the nymphs of Avon-street into keeping;\r\nbut, finding all these channels insufficient to drain him of his current\r\ncash, his counsellor has engaged him to give a general tea-drinking\r\nto-morrow at Wiltshire’s room. In order to give it the more eclat, every\r\ntable is to be furnished with sweet-meats and nosegays; which, however,\r\nare not to be touched till notice is given by the ringing of a bell, and\r\nthen the ladies may help themselves without restriction. This will be no\r\nbad way of trying the company’s breeding.’\r\n\r\n‘I will abide by that experiment (cried my uncle) and if I could find\r\na place to stand secure, without the vortex of the tumult, which I know\r\nwill ensue, I would certainly go thither and enjoy the scene.’ Quin\r\nproposed that we should take our station in the music-gallery, and\r\nwe took his advice. Holder had got thither before us, with his horns\r\nperdue, but we were admitted. The tea-drinking passed as usual, and the\r\ncompany having risen from the tables, were sauntering in groupes, in\r\nexpectation of the signal for attack, when the bell beginning to\r\nring, they flew with eagerness to the dessert, and the whole place was\r\ninstantly in commotion. There was nothing but justling, scrambling,\r\npulling, snatching, struggling, scolding, and screaming. The nosegays\r\nwere torn from one another’s hands and bosoms; the glasses and china\r\nwent to wreck; the tables and floors were strewed with comfits. Some\r\ncried; some swore; and the tropes and figures of Billingsgate were used\r\nwithout reserve in all their native zest and flavour; nor were those\r\nflowers of rhetoric unattended with significant gesticulation. Some\r\nsnapped their fingers; some forked them out; some clapped their hands,\r\nand some their back-sides; at length, they fairly proceeded to pulling\r\ncaps, and every thing seemed to presage a general battle; when Holder\r\nordered his horns to sound a charge, with a view to animate the\r\ncombatants, and inflame the contest; but this manoeuvre produced an\r\neffect quite contrary to what he expected. It was a note of reproach\r\nthat roused them to an immediate sense of their disgraceful situation.\r\nThey were ashamed of their absurd deportment, and suddenly desisted.\r\nThey gathered up their caps, ruffles, and handkerchiefs; and great part\r\nof them retired in silent mortification.\r\n\r\nQuin laughed at this adventure; but my uncle’s delicacy was hurt. He\r\nhung his head in manifest chagrin, and seemed to repine at the triumph\r\nof his judgment--Indeed, his victory was more complete than he imagined;\r\nfor, as we afterwards learned, the two amazons who singularized\r\nthemselves most in the action, did not come from the purlieus of\r\nPuddle-dock, but from the courtly neighbourhood of St James’s palace.\r\nOne was a baroness, and the other, a wealthy knight’s dowager--My uncle\r\nspoke not a word, till we had made our retreat good to the coffee-house;\r\nwhere, taking off his hat and wiping his forehead, ‘I bless God (said\r\nhe) that Mrs Tabitha Bramble did not take the field today!’ ‘I would pit\r\nher for a cool hundred (cried Quin) against the best shake-bag of the\r\nwhole main.’ The truth is, nothing could have kept her at home but the\r\naccident of her having taken physic before she knew the nature of the\r\nentertainment. She has been for some days furbishing up an old suit of\r\nblack velvet, to make her appearance as Sir Ulic’s partner at the next\r\nball.\r\n\r\nI have much to say of this amiable kinswoman; but she has not been\r\nproperly introduced to your acquaintance. She is remarkably civil to\r\nMr Quin; of whose sarcastic humour she seems to stand in awe; but her\r\ncaution is no match for her impertinence. ‘Mr Gwynn (said she the other\r\nday) I was once vastly entertained with your playing the Ghost of Gimlet\r\nat Drury-lane, when you rose up through the stage, with a white face and\r\nred eyes, and spoke of quails upon the frightful porcofine--Do, pray,\r\nspout a little the Ghost of Gimlet.’ ‘Madam (said Quin, with a glance of\r\nineffable disdain) the Ghost of Gimlet is laid, never to rise again’--\r\nInsensible of this check, she proceeded: ‘Well, to be sure, you looked\r\nand talked so like a real ghost; and then the cock crowed so natural.\r\nI wonder how you could teach him to crow so exact, in the very nick of\r\ntime; but, I suppose, he’s game--An’t he game, Mr Gwynn?’ ‘Dunghill,\r\nmadam.’--‘Well, dunghill, or not dunghill, he has got such a clear\r\ncounter-tenor, that I wish I had such another at Brambleton-hall, to\r\nwake the maids of a morning. Do you know where I could find one of his\r\nbrood?’ ‘Probably in the work-house at St Giles’s parish, madam; but I\r\nprotest I know not his particular mew!’ My uncle, frying with vexation,\r\ncried, ‘Good God, sister, how you talk! I have told you twenty times,\r\nthat this gentleman’s name is not Gwynn.’--‘Hoity toity, brother mine\r\n(she replied) no offence, I hope--Gwynn is an honorable name, of true\r\nold British extraction--I thought the gentleman had been come of Mrs\r\nHelen Gwynn, who was of his own profession; and if so be that were the\r\ncase, he might be of king Charles’s breed, and have royal blood in his\r\nveins.’--‘No, madam (answered Quin, with great solemnity) my mother was\r\nnot a whore of such distinction--True it is, I am sometimes tempted\r\nto believe myself of royal descent; for my inclinations are often\r\narbitrary--If I was an absolute prince, at this instant, I believe I\r\nshould send for the head of your cook in a charger--She has committed\r\nfelony, on the person of that John Dory, which is mangled in a cruel\r\nmanner, and even presented without sauce--O tempora! O mores!’\r\n\r\nThis good-humoured sally turned the conversation into a less\r\ndisagreeable channel--But, lest you should think my scribble as tedious\r\nas Mrs Tabby’s clack, I shall not add another word, but that I am as\r\nusual\r\n\r\nYours, J. MELFORD BATH, April 30.\r\n\nTo Dr LEWIS.\r\n\r\nDEAR LEWIS,\r\n\r\nI received your bill upon Wiltshire, which was punctually honoured; but\r\nas I don’t choose to keep so much cash by me, in a common lodging house,\r\nI have deposited 250l. in the bank of Bath, and shall take their bills\r\nfor it in London, when I leave this place, where the season draws to an\r\nend--You must know, that now being a-foot, I am resolved to give Liddy a\r\nglimpse of London. She is one of the best hearted creatures I ever knew,\r\nand gains upon my affection every day--As for Tabby, I have dropt such\r\nhints to the Irish baronet, concerning her fortune, as, I make no doubt,\r\nwill cool the ardour of his addresses. Then her pride will take the\r\nalarm; and the rancour of stale maidenhood being chafed, we shall hear\r\nnothing but slander and abuse of Sir Ulic Mackilligut--This rupture,\r\nI foresee, will facilitate our departure from Bath; where, at present,\r\nTabby seems to enjoy herself with peculiar satisfaction. For my part, I\r\ndetest it so much, that I should not have been able to stay so long in\r\nthe place if I had not discovered some old friends; whose conversation\r\nalleviates my disgust--Going to the coffeehouse one forenoon, I\r\ncould not help contemplating the company, with equal surprize and\r\ncompassion--We consisted of thirteen individuals; seven lamed by the\r\ngout, rheumatism, or palsy; three maimed by accident; and the rest\r\neither deaf or blind. One hobbled, another hopped, a third dragged his\r\nlegs after him like a wounded snake, a fourth straddled betwixt a pair\r\nof long crutches, like the mummy of a felon hanging in chains; a fifth\r\nwas bent into a horizontal position, like a mounted telescope, shoved in\r\nby a couple of chairmen; and a sixth was the bust of a man, set upright\r\nin a wheel machine, which the waiter moved from place to place.\r\n\r\nBeing struck with some of their faces, I consulted the\r\nsubscription-book; and, perceiving the names of several old friends,\r\nbegan to consider the groupe with more attention. At length I discovered\r\nrear-admiral Balderick, the companion of my youth, whom I had not seen\r\nsince he was appointed lieutenant of the Severn. He was metamorphosed\r\ninto an old man, with a wooden leg and a weatherbeaten face, which\r\nappeared the more ancient from his grey locks, that were truly\r\nvenerable--Sitting down at the table, where he was reading a news-paper,\r\nI gazed at him for some minutes, with a mixture of pleasure and regret,\r\nwhich made my heart gush with tenderness; then, taking him by the hand,\r\n‘Ah, Sam (said I) forty years ago I little thought’--I was too much\r\nmoved to proceed. ‘An old friend, sure enough! (cried he, squeezing my\r\nhand, and surveying me eagerly through his glasses) I know the looming\r\nof the vessel, though she has been hard strained since we parted; but I\r\ncan’t heave up the name’--The moment I told him who I was, he exclaimed,\r\n‘Ha! Matt, my old fellow cruizer, still afloat!’ And, starting up,\r\nhugged me in his arms. His transport, however, boded me no good; for, in\r\nsaluting me, he thrust the spring of his spectacles into my eye, and,\r\nat the same time, set his wooden stump upon my gouty toe; an attack that\r\nmade me shed tears in sad earnest--After the hurry of our recognition\r\nwas over, he pointed out two of our common friends in the room: the bust\r\nwas what remained of colonel Cockril, who had lost the use of his\r\nlimbs in making an American campaign; and the telescope proved to be\r\nmy college chum, sir Reginald Bently; who, with his new title, and\r\nunexpected inheritance, commenced fox-hunter, without having served\r\nhis apprenticeship to the mystery; and, in consequence of following the\r\nhounds through a river, was seized with an inflammation of his bowels,\r\nwhich has contracted him into his present attitude.\r\n\r\nOur former correspondence was forthwith renewed, with the most hearty\r\nexpressions of mutual good-will, and as we had met so unexpectedly, we\r\nagreed to dine together that very day at the tavern. My friend Quin,\r\nbeing luckily unengaged, obliged us with his company; and, truly, this\r\nthe most happy day I have passed these twenty years. You and I, Lewis,\r\nhaving been always together, never tasted friendship in this high gout,\r\ncontracted from long absence. I cannot express the half of what I felt\r\nat this casual meeting of three or four companions, who had been so\r\nlong separated, and so roughly treated by the storms of life. It was a\r\nrenovation of youth; a kind of resuscitation of the dead, that realized\r\nthose interesting dreams, in which we sometimes retrieve our ancient\r\nfriends from the grave. Perhaps my enjoyment was not the less pleasing\r\nfor being mixed with a strain of melancholy, produced by the remembrance\r\nof past scenes, that conjured up the ideas of some endearing connexions,\r\nwhich the hand of Death has actually dissolved.\r\n\r\nThe spirits and good humour of the company seemed to triumph over the\r\nwreck of their constitutions. They had even philosophy enough to\r\njoke upon their own calamities; such is the power of friendship, the\r\nsovereign cordial of life--I afterwards found, however, that they were\r\nnot without their moments, and even hours of disquiet. Each of them\r\napart, in succeeding conferences, expatiated upon his own particular\r\ngrievances; and they were all malcontents at bottom--Over and above\r\ntheir personal disasters, they thought themselves unfortunate in the\r\nlottery of life. Balderick complained, that all the recompence he\r\nhad received for his long and hard service, was the half-pay of a\r\nrear-admiral. The colonel was mortified to see himself over-topped by\r\nupstart generals, some of whom he had once commanded; and, being a man\r\nof a liberal turn, could ill put up with a moderate annuity, for which\r\nhe had sold his commission. As for the baronet, having run himself\r\nconsiderably in debt, on a contested election, he has been obliged to\r\nrelinquish his seat in parliament, and his seat in the country at the\r\nsame time, and put his estate to nurse; but his chagrin, which is the\r\neffect of his own misconduct, does not affect me half so much as that of\r\nthe other two, who have acted honourable and distinguished parts on the\r\ngreat theatre, and are now reduced to lead a weary life in this stew-pan\r\nof idleness and insignificance. They have long left off using the\r\nwaters, after having experienced their inefficacy. The diversions of the\r\nplace they are not in a condition to enjoy. How then do they make shift\r\nto pass their time? In the forenoon they crawl out to the Rooms or\r\nthe coffeehouse, where they take a hand at whist, or descant upon the\r\nGeneral Advertiser; and their evenings they murder in private parties,\r\namong peevish invalids, and insipid old women--This is the case with\r\na good number of individuals, whom nature seems to have intended for\r\nbetter purposes.\r\n\r\nAbout a dozen years ago, many decent families, restricted to small\r\nfortunes, besides those that came hither on the score of health, were\r\ntempted to settle at Bath, where they could then live comfortably, and\r\neven make a genteel appearance, at a small expence: but the madness of\r\nthe times has made the place too hot for them, and they are now obliged\r\nto think of other migrations--Some have already fled to the mountains\r\nof Wales, and others have retired to Exeter. Thither, no doubt, they\r\nwill be followed by the flood of luxury and extravagance, which will\r\ndrive them from place to place to the very Land’s End; and there, I\r\nsuppose, they will be obliged to ship themselves to some other country.\r\nBath is become a mere sink of profligacy and extortion. Every article of\r\nhouse-keeping is raised to an enormous price; a circumstance no longer\r\nto be wondered at, when we know that every petty retainer of fortune\r\npiques himself upon keeping a table, and thinks it is for the honour\r\nof his character to wink at the knavery of his servants, who are in a\r\nconfederacy with the market-people; and, of consequence, pay whatever\r\nthey demand. Here is now a mushroom of opulence, who pays a cook seventy\r\nguineas a week for furnishing him with one meal a day. This portentous\r\nfrenzy is become so contagious, that the very rabble and refuse of\r\nmankind are infected. I have known a negro-driver, from Jamaica, pay\r\nover-night, to the master of one of the rooms, sixty-five guineas for\r\ntea and coffee to the company, and leave Bath next morning, in such\r\nobscurity, that not one of his guests had the slightest idea of his\r\nperson, or even made the least inquiry about his name. Incidents of this\r\nkind are frequent; and every day teems with fresh absurdities, which are\r\ntoo gross to make a thinking man merry.\r\n\r\n--But I feel the spleen creeping on me apace; and therefore will indulge\r\nyou with a cessation, that you may have no unnecessary cause to curse\r\nyour correspondence with,\r\n\r\nDear Dick, Yours ever, MAT. BRAMBLE BATH, May 5.\r\n\nTo Miss LAETITIA WILLIS, at Gloucester.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR LETTY,\r\n\r\nI wrote you at great length by the post, the twenty-sixth of last month,\r\nto which I refer you for an account of our proceedings at Bath; and I\r\nexpect your answer with impatience. But, having this opportunity of a\r\nprivate hand, I send you two dozen of Bath rings; six of the best of\r\nwhich I desire you will keep for yourself, and distribute the rest among\r\nthe young ladies, our common friends, as you shall think proper--I don’t\r\nknow how you will approve of the mottoes; some of them are not much\r\nto my own liking; but I was obliged to take such as I could find ready\r\nmanufactured--I am vexed, that neither you nor I have received any\r\nfurther information of a certain person--Sure it cannot be wilful\r\nneglect!--O my dear Willis! I begin to be visited by strange fancies,\r\nand to have some melancholy doubts; which, however, it would be\r\nungenerous to harbour without further inquiry--My uncle, who has made\r\nme a present of a very fine set of garnets, talks of treating us with a\r\njaunt to London; which, you may imagine, will be highly agreeable; but\r\nI like Bath so well, that I hope he won’t think of leaving it till the\r\nseason is quite over; and yet, betwixt friends, something has happened\r\nto my aunt, which will probably shorten our stay in this place.\r\n\r\nYesterday, in the forenoon, she went by herself to a breakfasting in one\r\nof the rooms; and, in half an hour, returned in great agitation, having\r\nChowder along with her in the chair. I believe some accident must have\r\nhappened to that unlucky animal, which is the great source of all her\r\ntroubles. Dear Letty! what a pity it is, that a woman of her years\r\nand discretion, should place her affection upon such an ugly,\r\nill-conditioned cur, that snarls and snaps at every body. I asked John\r\nThomas, the footman who attended her, what was the matter? and he did\r\nnothing but grin. A famous dog-doctor was sent for, and undertook to\r\ncure the patient, provided he might carry him home to his own house; but\r\nhis mistress would not part with him out of her own sight--She ordered\r\nthe cook to warm cloths, which she applied to his bowels, with her own\r\nhand. She gave up all thoughts of going to the ball in the evening; and\r\nwhen Sir Ulic came to drink tea, refused to be seen; so that he went\r\naway to look for another partner. My brother Jery whistles and dances.\r\nMy uncle sometimes shrugs up his shoulders, and sometimes bursts out\r\na-laughing. My aunt sobs and scolds by turns; and her woman, Win.\r\nJenkins, stares and wonders with a foolish face of curiosity; and, for\r\nmy part, I am as curious as she, but ashamed to ask questions.\r\n\r\nPerhaps time will discover the mystery; for if it was any thing that\r\nhappened in the Rooms, it cannot be long concealed--All I know is, that\r\nlast night at supper, miss Bramble spoke very disdainfully of Sir Ulic\r\nMackilligut, and asked her brother if he intended to keep us sweltering\r\nall the summer at Bath? ‘No, sister Tabitha (said he, with an arch\r\nsmile) we shall retreat before the Dog-days begin; though I make no\r\ndoubt, that with a little temperance and discretion, our constitutions\r\nmight be kept cool enough all the year, even at Bath.’ As I don’t know\r\nthe meaning of this insinuation, I won’t pretend to make any remarks\r\nupon it at present: hereafter, perhaps, I may be able to explain it more\r\nto your satisfaction--In the mean time, I beg you will be punctual in\r\nyour correspondence, and continue to love your ever faithful\r\n\r\nLYDIA MELFORD BATH, May 6.\r\n\nTo Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of Jesus college, Oxon.\r\n\r\nSo then Mrs Blackerby’s affair has proved a false alarm, and I have\r\nsaved my money? I wish, however, her declaration had not been so\r\npremature; for though my being thought capable of making her a mother,\r\nmight have given me some credit, the reputation of an intrigue with such\r\na cracked pitcher does me no honour at all In my last I told you I had\r\nhopes of seeing Quin, in his hours of elevation at the tavern which is\r\nthe temple of mirth and good fellowship; where he, as priest of Comus,\r\nutters the inspirations of wit and humour--I have had that satisfaction.\r\nI have dined with his club at the Three Tuns, and had the honour to sit\r\nhim out. At half an hour past eight in the evening, he was carried\r\nhome with six good bottles of claret under his belt; and it being then\r\nFriday, he gave orders that he should not be disturbed till Sunday at\r\nnoon--You must not imagine that this dose had any other effect upon his\r\nconversation, but that of making it more extravagantly entertaining--He\r\nhad lost the use of his limbs, indeed, several hours before we parted,\r\nbut he retained all his other faculties in perfection; and as he gave\r\nvent to every whimsical idea as it rose, I was really astonished at the\r\nbrilliancy of his thoughts, and the force of his expression. Quin is a\r\nreal voluptuary in the articles of eating and drinking; and so confirmed\r\nan epicure, in the common acceptation of the term, that he cannot put up\r\nwith ordinary fare. This is a point of such importance with him, that he\r\nalways takes upon himself the charge of catering; and a man admitted\r\nto his mess, is always sure of eating delicate victuals, and drinking\r\nexcellent wine--He owns himself addicted to the delights of the stomach,\r\nand often jokes upon his own sensuality; but there is nothing selfish in\r\nthis appetite--He finds that good chear unites good company, exhilerates\r\nthe spirits, opens the heart, banishes all restraint from conversation,\r\nand promotes the happiest purposes of social life. But Mr James Quin\r\nis not a subject to be discussed in the compass of one letter; I shall\r\ntherefore, at present, leave him to his repose, and call another of a\r\nvery different complexion.\r\n\r\nYou desire to have further acquaintance with the person of our aunt,\r\nand promise yourself much entertainment from her connexion with Sir Ulic\r\nMackilligut: but in this hope you are baulked already; that connexion is\r\ndissolved. The Irish baronet is an old hound, that, finding her carrion,\r\nhas quitted the scent--I have already told you, that Mrs Tabitha Bramble\r\nis a maiden of forty-five. In her person, she is tall, raw-boned,\r\naukward, flat-chested, and stooping; her complexion is sallow and\r\nfreckled; her eyes are not grey, but greenish, like those of a cat, and\r\ngenerally inflamed; her hair is of a sandy, or rather dusty hue; her\r\nforehead low; her nose long, sharp, and, towards the extremity, always\r\nred in cool weather; her lips skinny, her mouth extensive, her teeth\r\nstraggling and loose, of various colours and conformation; and her long\r\nneck shrivelled into a thousand wrinkles--In her temper, she is proud,\r\nstiff, vain, imperious, prying, malicious, greedy, and uncharitable. In\r\nall likelihood, her natural austerity has been soured by disappointment\r\nin love; for her long celibacy is by no means owing to her dislike of\r\nmatrimony: on the contrary, she has left no stone unturned to avoid the\r\nreproachful epithet of old maid.\r\n\r\nBefore I was born, she had gone such lengths in the way of flirting\r\nwith a recruiting officer, that her reputation was a little singed. She\r\nafterwards made advances to the curate of the parish, who dropped some\r\ndistant hints about the next presentation to the living, which was in\r\nher brother’s gift; but finding that was already promised to another, he\r\nflew off at a tangent; and Mrs Tabby, in revenge, found means to deprive\r\nhim of his cure. Her next lover was lieutenant of a man of war, a\r\nrelation of the family, who did not understand the refinements of the\r\npassion, and expressed no aversion to grapple with cousin Tabby in the\r\nway of marriage; but before matters could be properly adjusted, he went\r\nout on a cruise, and was killed in an engagement with a French frigate.\r\nOur aunt, though baffled so often, did not yet despair. She layed all\r\nher snares for Dr Lewis, who is the fidus Achates of my uncle. She even\r\nfell sick upon the occasion, and prevailed with Matt to interpose in her\r\nbehalf with his friend; but the Doctor, being a shy cock, would not be\r\ncaught with chaff, and flatly rejected the proposal: so that Mrs Tabitha\r\nwas content to exert her patience once more, after having endeavoured\r\nin vain to effect a rupture betwixt the two friends; and now she thinks\r\nproper to be very civil to Lewis, who is become necessary to her in the\r\nway of his profession.\r\n\r\nThese, however, are not the only efforts she has made towards a nearer\r\nconjunction with our sex. Her fortune was originally no more than a\r\nthousand pounds; but she gained an accession of five hundred by the\r\ndeath of a sister, and the lieutenant left her three hundred in his\r\nwill. These sums she has more than doubled, by living free of all\r\nexpence, in her brother’s house; and dealing in cheese and Welsh\r\nflannel, the produce of his flocks and dairy. At present her capital is\r\nincreased to about four thousand pounds; and her avarice seems to grow\r\nevery day more and more rapacious: but even this is not so intolerable\r\nas the perverseness of her nature, which keeps the whole family\r\nin disquiet and uproar. She is one of those geniuses who find\r\nsome diabolical enjoyment in being dreaded and detested by their\r\nfellow-creatures.\r\n\r\nI once told my uncle, I was surprised that a man of his disposition\r\ncould bear such a domestic plague, when it could be so easily removed.\r\nThe remark made him sore, because it seemed to tax him with want of\r\nresolution--Wrinkling up his nose, and drawing down his eye-brows, ‘A\r\nyoung fellow (said he) when he first thrusts his snout into the world,\r\nis apt to be surprised at many things which a man of experience knows\r\nto be ordinary and unavoidable--This precious aunt of yours is become\r\ninsensibly a part of my constitution--Damn her! She’s a noli me tangere\r\nin my flesh, which I cannot bear to be touched or tampered with.’ I made\r\nno reply; but shifted the conversation. He really has an affection for\r\nthis original; which maintains its ground in defiance of common sense,\r\nand in despite of that contempt which he must certainly feel for her\r\ncharacter and understanding. Nay, I am convinced, that she has likewise\r\na most virulent attachment to his person; though her love never shews\r\nitself but in the shape of discontent; and she persists in tormenting\r\nhim out of pure tenderness--The only object within doors upon which she\r\nbestows any marks of affection, in the usual stile, is her dog Chowder;\r\na filthy cur from Newfoundland, which she had in a present from the wife\r\nof a skipper in Swansey. One would imagine she had distinguished this\r\nbeast with her favour on account of his ugliness and ill-nature, if it\r\nwas not, indeed, an instinctive sympathy, between his disposition and\r\nher own. Certain it is, she caresses him without ceasing; and even\r\nharasses the family in the service of this cursed animal, which, indeed,\r\nhas proved the proximate cause of her breach with Sir Ulic Mackilligut.\r\n\r\nYou must know, she yesterday wanted to steal a march of poor Liddy, and\r\nwent to breakfast in the Room without any other companion than her dog,\r\nin expectation of meeting with the Baronet, who had agreed to dance with\r\nher in the evening--Chowder no sooner made his appearance in the Room,\r\nthan the Master of the Ceremonies, incensed at his presumption, ran\r\nup to drive him away, and threatened him with his foot; but the other\r\nseemed to despise his authority, and displaying a formidable case of\r\nlong, white, sharp teeth, kept the puny monarch at bay--While he stood\r\nunder some trepidation, fronting his antagonist, and bawling to the\r\nwaiter, Sir Ulic Mackilligut came to his assistance; and seeming\r\nignorant of the connexion between this intruder and his mistress, gave\r\nthe former such a kick in the jaws, as sent him howling to the door--Mrs\r\nTabitha, incensed at this outrage, ran after him, squalling in a tone\r\nequally disagreeable; while the Baronet followed her on one side,\r\nmaking apologies for his mistake; and Derrick on the other, making\r\nremonstrances upon the rules and regulations of the place.\r\n\r\nFar from being satisfied with the Knight’s excuses, she said she was\r\nsure he was no gentleman; and when the Master of the Ceremonies offered\r\nto hand her into the chair, she rapped him over the knuckles with her\r\nfan. My uncle’s footman being still at the door, she and Chowder got\r\ninto the same vehicle, and were carried off amidst the jokes of the\r\nchairmen and other populace--I had been riding out on Clerkendown, and\r\nhappened to enter just as the fracas was over--The Baronet, coming up to\r\nme with an affected air of chagrin, recounted the adventure; at which\r\nI laughed heartily, and then his countenance cleared up. ‘My dear soul\r\n(said he) when I saw a sort of a wild baist, snarling with open mouth\r\nat the Master of the Ceremonies, like the red cow going to devour Tom\r\nThumb, I could do no less than go to the assistance of the little man;\r\nbut I never dreamt the baist was one of Mrs Bramble’s attendants--O! if\r\nI had, he might have made his breakfast upon Derrick and welcome--But\r\nyou know, my dear friend, how natural it is for us Irishmen to blunder,\r\nand to take the wrong sow by the ear--However, I will confess judgment,\r\nand cry her mercy; and it is to be hoped, a penitent sinner may be\r\nforgiven.’ I told him, that as the offence was not voluntary of his\r\nside, it was to be hoped he would not find her implacable.\r\n\r\nBut, in truth, all this concern was dissembled. In his approaches of\r\ngallantry to Mrs Tabitha, he had been misled by a mistake of at least\r\nsix thousand pounds, in the calculation of her fortune; and in this\r\nparticular he was just undeceived. He, therefore, seized the first\r\nopportunity of incurring her displeasure decently, in such a manner as\r\nwould certainly annihilate the correspondence; and he could not have\r\ntaken a more effectual method, than that of beating her dog. When he\r\npresented himself at our door, to pay his respects to the offended fair,\r\nhe was refused admittance, and given to understand that he should never\r\nfind her at home for the future. She was not so inaccessible to Derrick,\r\nwho came to demand satisfaction for the insult she had offered to him,\r\neven in the verge of his own court. She knew it was convenient to be\r\nwell with the Master of the Ceremonies, while she continued to frequent\r\nthe Rooms; and, having heard he was a poet, began to be afraid of making\r\nher appearance in a ballad or lampoon.--She therefore made excuses\r\nfor what she had done, imputing it to the flutter of her spirits; and\r\nsubscribed handsomely for his poems: so that he was perfectly appeased,\r\nand overwhelmed her with a profusion of compliment. He even solicited a\r\nreconciliation with Chowder; which, however, the latter declined; and he\r\ndeclared, that if he could find a precedent in the annals of the Bath,\r\nwhich he would carefully examine for that purpose, her favourite should\r\nbe admitted to the next public breakfasting--But, I, believe, she will\r\nnot expose herself or him to the risque of a second disgrace--Who will\r\nsupply the place of Mackilligut in her affections, I cannot foresee;\r\nbut nothing in the shape of man can come amiss. Though she is a violent\r\nchurch-woman, of the most intolerant zeal, I believe in my conscience\r\nshe would have no objection, at present, to treat on the score of\r\nmatrimony with an Anabaptist, Quaker, or Jew; and even ratify the treaty\r\nat the expense of her own conversion. But, perhaps, I think too hardly\r\nof this kinswoman; who, I must own, is very little beholden to the good\r\nopinion of\r\n\r\nYours, J. MELFORD BATH, May 6.\r\n\nTo Dr LEWIS.\r\n\r\nYou ask me, why I don’t take the air a-horseback, during this fine\r\nweather?--In which of the avenues of this paradise would you have me\r\ntake that exercise? Shall I commit myself to the high-roads of London\r\nor Bristol, to be stifled with dust, or pressed to death in the midst\r\nof post-chaises, flying-machines, waggons, and coal-horses; besides\r\nthe troops of fine gentlemen that take to the highway, to shew their\r\nhorsemanship; and the coaches of fine ladies, who go thither to shew\r\ntheir equipages? Shall I attempt the Downs, and fatigue myself to death\r\nin climbing up an eternal ascent, without any hopes of reaching the\r\nsummit? Know then, I have made divers desperate leaps at those upper\r\nregions; but always fell backward into this vapour-pit, exhausted\r\nand dispirited by those ineffectual efforts; and here we poor\r\nvaletudinarians pant and struggle, like so many Chinese gudgeons,\r\ngasping in the bottom of a punch-bowl. By Heaven it is a kind of\r\nenchantment! If I do not speedily break the spell, and escape, I may\r\nchance to give up the ghost in this nauseous stew of corruption--It was\r\nbut two nights ago, that I had like to have made my public exit, at a\r\nminute’s warning. One of my greatest weaknesses is that of suffering\r\nmyself to be over-ruled by the opinion of people, whose judgment I\r\ndespise--I own, with shame and confusion of face, that importunity\r\nof any kind I cannot resist. This want of courage and constancy is an\r\noriginal flaw in my nature, which you must have often observed with\r\ncompassion, if not with contempt. I am afraid some of our boasted\r\nvirtues maybe traced up to this defect.\r\n\r\nWithout further preamble, I was persuaded to go to a ball, on purpose to\r\nsee Liddy dance a minuet with a young petulant jackanapes, the only\r\nson of a wealthy undertaker from London, whose mother lodges in our\r\nneighbourhood, and has contracted an acquaintance with Tabby. I sat a\r\ncouple of long hours, half stifled, in the midst of a noisome crowd;\r\nand could not help wondering that so many hundreds of those that rank as\r\nrational creatures, could find entertainment in seeing a succession of\r\ninsipid animals, describing the same dull figure for a whole evening, on\r\nan area, not much bigger than a taylor’s shop-board. If there had been\r\nany beauty, grace, activity, magnificent dress, or variety of any kind\r\nhowsoever absurd, to engage the attention, and amuse the fancy, I should\r\nnot have been surprised; but there was no such object: it was a tiresome\r\nrepetition of the same languid, frivolous scene, performed by actors\r\nthat seemed to sleep in all their motions. The continual swimming of\r\nthese phantoms before my eyes, gave me a swimming of the head; which was\r\nalso affected by the fouled air, circulating through such a number of\r\nrotten human bellows. I therefore retreated towards the door, and stood\r\nin the passage to the next room, talking to my friend Quin; when an end\r\nbeing put to the minuets, the benches were removed to make way for the\r\ncountry-dances; and the multitude rising at once, the whole atmosphere\r\nwas put in commotion. Then, all of a sudden, came rushing upon me an\r\nEgyptian gale, so impregnated with pestilential vapours, that my nerves\r\nwere overpowered, and I dropt senseless upon the floor.\r\n\r\nYou may easily conceive what a clamour and confusion this accident must\r\nhave produced, in such an assembly--I soon recovered, however, and found\r\nmyself in an easy chair, supported by my own people--Sister Tabby, in\r\nher great tenderness, had put me to the torture, squeezing my hand under\r\nher arm, and stuffing my nose with spirit of hartshorn, till the whole\r\ninside was excoriated. I no sooner got home, than I sent for Doctor\r\nCh--, who assured me I needed not be alarmed, for my swooning was\r\nentirely occasioned by an accidental impression of fetid effluvia upon\r\nnerves of uncommon sensibility. I know not how other people’s nerves\r\nare constructed; but one would imagine they must be made of very coarse\r\nmaterials, to stand the shock of such a torrid assault. It was, indeed,\r\na compound of villainous smells, in which the most violent stinks,\r\nand the most powerful perfumes, contended for the mastery. Imagine to\r\nyourself a high exalted essence of mingled odours, arising from putrid\r\ngums, imposthumated lungs, sour flatulencies, rank armpits, sweating\r\nfeet, running sores and issues, plasters, ointments, and embrocations,\r\nhungary-water, spirit of lavender, assafoetida drops, musk, hartshorn,\r\nand sal volatile; besides a thousand frowzy steams, which I could not\r\nanalyse. Such, O Dick! is the fragrant aether we breathe in the polite\r\nassemblies of Bath--Such is the atmosphere I have exchanged for the\r\npure, elastic, animating air of the Welsh mountains--O Rus, quando te\r\naspiciam!---I wonder what the devil possessed me--\r\n\r\nBut few words are best: I have taken my resolution--You may well suppose\r\nI don’t intend to entertain the company with a second exhibition--I have\r\npromised, in an evil hour, to proceed to London, and that promise shall\r\nbe performed, but my stay in the metropolis shall be brief. I have, for\r\nthe benefit of my health, projected an expedition to the North, which, I\r\nhope, will afford some agreeable pastime. I have never travelled farther\r\nthat way than Scarborough; and, I think, it is a reproach upon me, as a\r\nBritish freeholder, to have lived so long without making an excursion to\r\nthe other side of the Tweed. Besides, I have some relations settled in\r\nYorkshire, to whom it may not be improper to introduce my nephew and\r\nhis sister--At present, I have nothing to add, but that Tabby is happily\r\ndisentangled from the Irish Baronet; and that I will not fail to make\r\nyou acquainted, from time to time, with the sequel of our adventures: a\r\nmark of consideration, which, perhaps, you would willingly dispense with\r\nin\r\n\r\nYour humble servant, M. BRAMBLE BATH, May 8.\r\n\nTo Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of Jesus college, Oxon.\r\n\r\nDEAR PHILLIPS,\r\n\r\nA few days ago we were terribly alarmed by my uncle’s fainting at the\r\nball--He has been ever since cursing his own folly, for going thither at\r\nthe request of an impertinent woman. He declares, he will sooner visit\r\na house infected with the plague, than trust himself in such a nauseous\r\nspital for the future, for he swears the accident was occasioned by the\r\nstench of the crowd; and that he would never desire a stronger proof of\r\nour being made of very gross materials, than our having withstood the\r\nannoyance, by which he was so much discomposed. For my part, I am very\r\nthankful for the coarseness of my organs, being in no danger of\r\never falling a sacrifice to the delicacy of my nose. Mr Bramble is\r\nextravagantly delicate in all his sensations, both of soul and body. I\r\nwas informed by Dr Lewis, that he once fought a duel with an officer\r\nof the horseguards, for turning aside to the Park-wall, on a necessary\r\noccasion, when he was passing with a lady under his protection. His\r\nblood rises at every instance of insolence and cruelty, even where he\r\nhimself is no way concerned; and ingratitude makes his teeth chatter. On\r\nthe other hand, the recital of a generous, humane, or grateful action,\r\nnever fails to draw from him tears of approbation, which he is often\r\ngreatly distressed to conceal.\r\n\r\nYesterday, one Paunceford gave tea, on particular invitation--This man,\r\nafter having been long buffetted by adversity, went abroad; and Fortune,\r\nresolved to make him amends for her former coyness, set him all at once\r\nup to the very ears in affluence. He has now emerged from obscurity,\r\nand blazes out in all the tinsel of the times. I don’t find that he is\r\ncharged with any practices that the law deems dishonest, or that his\r\nwealth has made him arrogant and inaccessible; on the contrary, he\r\ntakes great pains to appear affable and gracious. But, they say, he\r\nis remarkable for shrinking from his former friendships, which were\r\ngenerally too plain and home-spun to appear amidst his present brilliant\r\nconnexions; and that he seems uneasy at sight of some old benefactors,\r\nwhom a man of honour would take pleasure to acknowledge--Be that as it\r\nmay, he had so effectually engaged the company at Bath, that when I went\r\nwith my uncle to the coffeehouse in the evening, there was not a soul\r\nin the room but one person, seemingly in years, who sat by the fire,\r\nreading one of the papers. Mr Bramble, taking his station close by\r\nhim, ‘There is such a crowd and confusion of chairs in the passage to\r\nSimpson’s (said he) that we could hardly get along--I wish those\r\nminions of fortune would fall upon more laudable ways of spending their\r\nmoney.--I suppose, Sir, you like this kind of entertainment as little as\r\nI do?’ ‘I cannot say I have any great relish for such entertainments,’\r\nanswered the other, without taking his eyes off the paper--‘Mr Serle\r\n(resumed my uncle) I beg pardon for interrupting you; but I can’t resist\r\nthe curiosity I have to know if you received a card on this occasion?’\r\n\r\nThe man seemed surprised at this address, and made some pause, as\r\ndoubtful what answer he should make. ‘I know my curiosity is impertinent\r\n(added my uncle) but I have a particular reason for asking the favour.’\r\n‘If that be the case (replied Mr Serle) I shall gratify you without\r\nhesitation, by owning that I have had no card. But, give me leave,\r\nSir, to ask in my turn, what reason you think I have to expect such an\r\ninvitation from the gentleman who gives tea?’ ‘I have my own reasons\r\n(cried Mr Bramble, with some emotion) and am convinced, more than ever,\r\nthat this Paunceford is a contemptible fellow.’ ‘Sir (said the other,\r\nlaying down the paper) I have not the honour to know you; but your\r\ndiscourse is a little mysterious, and seems to require some explanation.\r\nThe person you are pleased to treat so cavalierly, is a gentleman of\r\nsome consequence in the community; and, for aught you know, I may also\r\nhave my particular reasons for defending his character’--‘If I was not\r\nconvinced of the contrary (observed the other) I should not have gone so\r\nfar’--‘Let me tell you, Sir (said the stranger, raising his voice) you\r\nhave gone too far, in hazarding such reflections’.\r\n\r\nHere he was interrupted by my uncle; who asked peevishly if he was\r\nDon Quixote enough, at this time of day, to throw down his gauntlet as\r\nchampion for a man who had treated him with such ungrateful neglect.\r\n‘For my part (added he) I shall never quarrel with you again upon this\r\nsubject; and what I have said now, has been suggested as much by my\r\nregard for you, as by my contempt of him’--Mr Serle, then pulling off\r\nhis spectacles, eyed uncle very earnestly, saying, in a mitigated\r\ntone, ‘Surely I am much obliged--Ah, Mr Bramble! I now recollect your\r\nfeatures, though I have not seen you these many years.’ ‘We might\r\nhave been less strangers to one another (answered the squire) if\r\nour correspondence had not been interrupted, in consequence of a\r\nmisunderstanding, occasioned by this very--, but no matter--Mr Serle, I\r\nesteem your character; and my friendship, such as it is, you may freely\r\ncommand.’ ‘The offer is too agreeable to be declined (said he); I\r\nembrace it very cordially; and, as the first fruits of it, request that\r\nyou will change this subject, which, with me, is a matter of peculiar\r\ndelicacy.’\r\n\r\nMy uncle owned he was in the right, and the discourse took a more\r\ngeneral turn. Mr Serle passed the evening with us at our lodgings; and\r\nappeared to be intelligent, and even entertaining; but his disposition\r\nwas rather of a melancholy hue. My uncle says he is a man of uncommon\r\nparts, and unquestioned probity: that his fortune, which was originally\r\nsmall, has been greatly hurt by a romantic spirit of generosity, which\r\nhe has often displayed, even at the expence of his discretion, in favour\r\nof worthless individuals--That he had rescued Paunceford from the lowest\r\ndistress, when he was bankrupt, both in means and reputation--That\r\nhe had espoused his interests with a degree of enthusiasm, broke with\r\nseveral friends, and even drawn his sword against my uncle, who had\r\nparticular reasons for questioning the moral character of the said\r\nPaunceford: that, without Serle’s countenance and assistance, the other\r\nnever could have embraced the opportunity, which has raised him to this\r\npinnacle of wealth: that Paunceford, in the first transports of his\r\nsuccess, had written, from abroad, letters to different correspondents,\r\nowning his obligations to Mr Serle, in the warmest terms of\r\nacknowledgement, and declared he considered himself only as a factor\r\nfor the occasions of his best friend: that, without doubt, he had made\r\ndeclarations of the same nature to his benefactor himself, though this\r\nlast was always silent and reserved on the subject; but for some years,\r\nthose tropes and figures of rhetoric had been disused; that, upon his\r\nreturn to England, he had been lavish in his caresses to Mr Serle,\r\ninvited him to his house, and pressed him to make it his own: that he\r\nhad overwhelmed him with general professions, and affected to express\r\nthe warmest regard for him, in company of their common acquaintance; so\r\nthat every body believed his gratitude was liberal as his fortune; and\r\nsome went so far as to congratulate Mr Serle on both.\r\n\r\nAll this time Paunceford carefully and artfully avoided particular\r\ndiscussions with his old patron, who had too much spirit to drop\r\nthe most distant hint of balancing the account of obligation: that,\r\nnevertheless, a man of his feelings could not but resent this shocking\r\nreturn for all his kindness: and, therefore, he withdrew himself from\r\nthe connexion, without coming to the least explanation or speaking\r\na syllable on the subject to any living soul; so that now their\r\ncorrespondence is reduced to a slight salute with the hat, when they\r\nchance to meet in any public place; an accident that rarely happens, for\r\ntheir walks lie different ways. Mr Paunceford lives in a palace, feeds\r\nupon dainties, is arrayed in sumptuous apparel, appears in all the pomp\r\nof equipage, and passes his time among the nobles of the land. Serle\r\nlodges in Stall-street, up two pair of stairs backwards, walks a-foot\r\nin a Bath-rug, eats for twelve shillings a-week, and drinks water\r\nas preservative against the gout and gravel--Mark the vicissitude.\r\nPaunceford once resided in a garret; where he subsisted upon\r\nsheep’s-trotters and cow-heel, from which commons he was translated to\r\nthe table of Serle, that ever abounded with good-chear; until want of\r\neconomy and retention reduced him to a slender annuity in his decline of\r\nyears, that scarce affords the bare necessaries of life.--Paunceford,\r\nhowever, does him the honour to speak of him still, with uncommon\r\nregard; and to declare what pleasure it would give him to contribute in\r\nany shape to his convenience: ‘But you know (he never fails to add) he’s\r\na shy kind of a man--And then such a perfect philosopher, that he looks\r\nupon all superfluities with the most sovereign contempt. Having given\r\nyou this sketch of squire Paunceford, I need not make any comment on his\r\ncharacter, but leave it at the mercy of your own reflection; from which\r\nI dare say, it will meet with as little quarter as it has found with\r\n\r\nYours always, J. MELFORD BATH, May 10.\r\n\nTo Mrs MARY JONES, at Brambleton-hall.\r\n\r\nDEAR MOLLY,\r\n\r\nWe are all upon the ving--Hey for London, girl!--Fecks! we have been\r\nlong enough here; for we’re all turned tipsy turvy--Mistress has\r\nexcarded Sir Ulic for kicking of Chowder; and I have sent O Frizzle\r\naway, with a flea in his ear--I’ve shewn him how little I minded his\r\ntinsy and his long tail--A fellor, who would think for to go, for to\r\noffer, to take up with a dirty trollop under my nose--I ketched him in\r\nthe very feet, coming out of the housemaids garret.--But I have gi’en\r\nthe dirty slut a siserary. O Molly! the sarvants at Bath are devils\r\nin garnet. They lite the candle at both ends--Here’s nothing but\r\nginketting, and wasting, and thieving and tricking, and trigging; and\r\nthen they are never content--They won’t suffer the ‘squire and mistress\r\nto stay any longer; because they have been already above three weeks in\r\nthe house; and they look for a couple of ginneys a-piece at our going\r\naway; and this is a parquisite they expect every month in the season;\r\nbeing as how no family has a right to stay longer than four weeks in\r\nthe same lodgings; and so the cuck swears she will pin the dish-clout to\r\nmistress’s tail; and the house-maid vows, she’ll put cowitch in master’s\r\nbed, if so be he don’t discamp without furder ado--I don’t blame\r\nthem for making the most of their market, in the way of vails and\r\nparquisites; and I defy the devil to say I am a tail-carrier, or ever\r\nbrought a poor sarvant into trouble--But then they oft to have some\r\nconscience, in vronging those that be sarvants like themselves--For you\r\nmust no, Molly, I missed three-quarters of blond lace, and a remnant\r\nof muslin, and my silver thimble; which was the gift of true love;\r\nthey were all in my workbasket, that I left upon the table in the\r\nsarvants-hall, when mistresses bell rung; but if they had been under\r\nlock and kay, ‘twould have been all the same; for there are double keys\r\nto all the locks in Bath; and they say as how the very teeth an’t\r\nsafe in your head, if you sleep with your mouth open--And so says I to\r\nmyself, them things could not go without hands; and so I’ll watch\r\ntheir waters: and so I did with a vitness; for then it was I found Bett\r\nconsarned with O Frizzle. And as the cuck had thrown her slush at me,\r\nbecause I had taken part with Chowder, when he fit, with the turnspit,\r\nI resolved to make a clear kitchen, and throw some of her fat into the\r\nfire. I ketched the chare-woman going out with her load in the morning,\r\nbefore she thought I was up, and brought her to mistress with her whole\r\ncargo--Marry, what do’st think she had got in the name of God? Her\r\nbuckets were foaming full of our best bear, and her lap was stuffed with\r\na cold tongue, part of a buttock of beef, half a turkey, and a swinging\r\nlump of butter, and the matter of ten mould kandles, that had scarce\r\never been lit. The cuck brazened it out, and said it was her rite to\r\nrummage the pantry; and she was ready for to go before the mare: that\r\nhe had been her potticary many years, and would never think of hurting a\r\npoor sarvant, for giving away the scraps of the kitchen. I went another\r\nway to work with madam Betty, because she had been saucy, and called me\r\nskandelus names; and said O Frizzle couldn’t abide me, and twenty other\r\nodorous falsehoods. I got a varrant from the mare, and her box being\r\nsarched by the constable, my things came out sure enuff; besides a full\r\npound of vax candles, and a nite-cap of mistress, that I could sware to\r\non my cruperal oaf--O! then madam Mopstick came upon her merry\r\nbones; and as the squire wouldn’t hare of a pursecution, she scaped a\r\nskewering: but the longest day she has to live, she’ll remember your\r\n\r\nHumble sarvant, W. JENKINS BATH, May 15.\r\n\r\nIf the hind should come again, before we be gone, pray send me the shift\r\nand apron, with the vite gallow manky shoes; which you’ll find in my\r\npillowber--Sarvice to Saul--\r\n\nTo Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bart. of Jesus college, Oxon.\r\n\r\nYou are in the right, dear Phillips; I don’t expect regular answers\r\nto every letter--I know a college-life is too circumscribed to afford\r\nmaterials for such quick returns of communication. For my part, I am\r\ncontinually shifting the scene, and surrounded with new objects; some\r\nof which are striking enough. I shall therefore conclude my journal for\r\nyour amusement; and, though, in all appearance, it will not treat of\r\nvery important or interesting particulars, it may prove, perhaps, not\r\naltogether uninstructive and unentertaining.\r\n\r\nThe music and entertainments of Bath are over for this season; and\r\nall our gay birds of passage have taken their flight to Bristolwell,\r\nTunbridge, Brighthelmstone, Scarborough, Harrowgate, &c. Not a soul is\r\nseen in this place, but a few broken-winded parsons, waddling like so\r\nmany crows along the North Parade. There is always a great shew of\r\nthe clergy at Bath: none of your thin, puny, yellow, hectic figures,\r\nexhausted with abstinence, and hardy study, labouring under the morbi\r\neruditorum, but great overgrown dignitaries and rectors, with rubicund\r\nnoses and gouty ancles, or broad bloated faces, dragging along great\r\nswag bellies; the emblems of sloth and indigestion.\r\n\r\nNow we are upon the subject of parsons, I must tell you a ludicrous\r\nadventure, which was achieved the other day by Tom Eastgate, whom you\r\nmay remember on the foundation of Queen’s. He had been very assiduous\r\nto pin himself upon George Prankley, who was a gentleman-commoner of\r\nChristchurch, knowing the said Prankley was heir to a considerable\r\nestate, and would have the advowson of a good living, the incumbent of\r\nwhich was very old and infirm. He studied his passions, and flattered\r\nthem so effectually, as to become his companion and counsellor; and,\r\nat last, obtained of him a promise of the presentation, when the living\r\nshould fall. Prankley, on his uncle’s death, quitted Oxford, and made\r\nhis first appearance in the fashionable world at London; from whence\r\nhe came lately to Bath, where he has been exhibiting himself among the\r\nbucks and gamesters of the place. Eastgate followed him hither; but he\r\nshould not have quitted him for a moment, at his first emerging into\r\nlife. He ought to have known he was a fantastic, foolish, fickle\r\nfellow, who would forget his college-attachments the moment they ceased\r\nappealing to his senses. Tom met with a cold reception from his old\r\nfriend; and was, moreover, informed, that he had promised the living to\r\nanother man, who had a vote in the county, where he proposed to offer\r\nhimself a candidate at the next general election. He now remembered\r\nnothing of Eastgate, but the freedoms he had used to take with him,\r\nwhile Tom had quietly stood his butt, with an eye to the benefice; and\r\nthose freedoms he began to repeat in common-place sarcasms on his person\r\nand his cloth, which he uttered in the public coffeehouse, for the\r\nentertainment of the company. But he was egregiously mistaken in\r\ngiving his own wit credit for that tameness of Eastgate, which had been\r\nentirely owing to prudential considerations. These being now removed,\r\nhe retorted his repartee with interest, and found no great difficulty in\r\nturning the laugh upon the aggressor; who, losing his temper, called him\r\nnames, and asked, If he knew whom he talked to? After much altercation,\r\nPrankley, shaking his cane, bid him hold his tongue, otherwise he could\r\ndust his cassock for him. ‘I have no pretensions to such a valet (said\r\nTom) but if you should do me that office, and overheat yourself, I have\r\nhere a good oaken towel at your service.’\r\n\r\nPrankley was equally incensed and confounded at this reply. After a\r\nmoment’s pause, he took him aside towards die window; and, pointing to\r\nthe clump of firs, on Clerken-down, asked in a whisper, if he had\r\nspirit enough to meet him there, with a case of pistols, at six o’clock\r\ntomorrow morning. Eastgate answered in the affirmative; and, with a\r\nsteady countenance, assured him, he would not fail to give him the\r\nrendezvous at the hour he mentioned. So saying, he retired; and the\r\nchallenger stayed some time in manifest agitation. In the morning,\r\nEastgate, who knew his man, and had taken his resolution, went to\r\nPrankley’s lodgings, and roused him by five o’clock.\r\n\r\nThe squire, in all probability, cursed his punctuality in his heart, but\r\nhe affected to talk big; and having prepared his artillery overnight,\r\nthey crossed the water at the end of the South Parade. In their progress\r\nup the hill, Prankley often eyed the parson, in hopes of perceiving\r\nsome reluctance in his countenance; but as no such marks appeared, he\r\nattempted to intimidate him by word of mouth. ‘If these flints do their\r\noffice (said he) I’ll do thy business in a few minutes.’ ‘I desire you\r\nwill do your best (replied the other); for my part, I come not here to\r\ntrifle. Our lives are in the hands of God; and one of us already totters\r\non the brink of eternity’ This remark seemed to make some impression\r\nupon the squire, who changed countenance, and with a faultering accent\r\nobserved, ‘That it ill became a clergyman to be concerned in quarrels\r\nand bloodshed’--‘Your insolence to me (said Eastgate) I should have bore\r\nwith patience, had not you cast the most infamous reflections upon my\r\norder, the honour of which I think myself in duty bound to maintain,\r\neven at the expence of my heart’s blood; and surely it can be no crime\r\nto put out of the world a profligate wretch, without any sense of\r\nprinciple, morality, or religion’--‘Thou may’st take away my life (cried\r\nPrankley, in great perturbation) but don’t go to murder my character.\r\nWhat! has’t got no conscience?’ ‘My conscience is perfectly quiet\r\n(replied the other); and now, Sir, we are upon the spot--Take your\r\nground as near as you please; prime your pistol; and the Lord, of his\r\ninfinite mercy, have compassion upon your miserable soul!’\r\n\r\nThis ejaculation he pronounced in a loud solemn tone, with his hat off,\r\nand his eyes lifted up; then drawing a large horse-pistol, he presented,\r\nand put himself in a posture of action. Prankley took his distance, and\r\nendeavoured to prime, but his hand shook with such violence, that he\r\nfound this operation impracticable--His antagonist, seeing how it was\r\nwith him, offered his assistance, and advanced for that purpose; when\r\nthe poor squire, exceedingly alarmed at what he had heard and seen,\r\ndesired the action might be deferred till next day, as he had not\r\nsettled his affairs. ‘I ha’n’t made my will (said he); my sisters are\r\nnot provided for; and I just now recollect an old promise, which my\r\nconscience tells me I ought to perform--I’ll first convince thee,\r\nthat I’m not a wretch without principle, and then thou shalt have an\r\nopportunity to take my life, which thou seem’st to thirst after so\r\neagerly.’\r\n\r\nEastgate understood the hint; and told him, that one day should break no\r\nsquares: adding, ‘God forbid that I should be the means of hindering you\r\nfrom acting the part of an honest man, and a dutiful brother’--By virtue\r\nof this cessation, they returned peaceably together. Prankley forthwith\r\nmade out the presentation of the living, and delivered it to Eastgate,\r\ntelling him at the same time, he had now settled his affairs, and was\r\nready to attend him to the Fir-grove; but Tom declared he could not\r\nthink of lifting his hand against the life of so great a benefactor--He\r\ndid more: when they next met at the coffeehouse, he asked pardon of Mr\r\nPrankley, if in his passion he had said any thing to give him offence;\r\nand the squire was so gracious as to forgive him with a cordial shake of\r\nthe hand, declaring, that he did not like to be at variance with an old\r\ncollege companion--Next day, however, he left Bath abruptly; and then\r\nEastgate told me all these particulars, not a little pleased with the\r\neffects of his own sagacity, by which he has secured a living worth\r\n160l. per annum.\r\n\r\nOf my uncle, I have nothing at present to say; but that we set out\r\ntomorrow for London en famille. He and the ladies, with the maid and\r\nChowder in a coach; I and the man-servant a-horseback. The particulars\r\nof our journey you shall have in my next, provided no accident happens\r\nto prevent,\r\n\r\nYours ever, J. MELFORD BATH May 17.\r\n\nTo Dr LEWIS.\r\n\r\nDEAR DICK,\r\n\r\nI shall to-morrow set out for London, where I have bespoke lodgings, at\r\nMrs Norton’s in Golden-square. Although I am no admirer of Bath, I shall\r\nleave it with regret; because I must part with some old friends,\r\nwhom, in all probability, I shall never see again. In the course of\r\ncoffeehouse conversation, I had often heard very extraordinary encomiums\r\npassed on the performances of Mr T--, a gentleman residing in this\r\nplace, who paints landscapes for his amusement. As I have no great\r\nconfidence in the taste and judgment of coffeehouse connoisseurs, and\r\nnever received much pleasure from this branch of the art, those general\r\npraises made no impression at all on my curiosity; but, at the request\r\nof a particular friend, I went yesterday to see the pieces, which had\r\nbeen so warmly commended--I must own I am no judge of painting, though\r\nvery fond of pictures. I don’t imagine that my senses would play me so\r\nfalse, as to betray me into admiration of any thing that was very bad;\r\nbut, true it is, I have often overlooked capital beauties, in pieces of\r\nextraordinary merit.--If I am not totally devoid of taste, however, this\r\nyoung gentleman of Bath is the best landscape-painter now living: I was\r\nstruck with his performances in such a manner, as I had never been\r\nby painting before. His trees not only have a richness of foliage\r\nand warmth of colouring, which delights the view; but also a certain\r\nmagnificence in the disposition and spirit in the expression, which\r\nI cannot describe. His management of the chiaro oscuro, or light and\r\nshadow, especially gleams of sunshine, is altogether wonderful, both in\r\nthe contrivance and execution; and he is so happy in his perspective,\r\nand marking his distances at sea, by a progressive series of ships,\r\nvessels, capes, and promontories, that I could not help thinking, I had\r\na distant view of thirty leagues upon the back-ground of the picture. If\r\nthere is any taste for ingenuity left in a degenerate age, fast sinking\r\ninto barbarism, this artist, I apprehend, will make a capital figure, as\r\nsoon as his works are known.\r\n\r\nTwo days ago, I was favoured with a visit by Mr Fitzowen; who, with\r\ngreat formality, solicited my vote and interest at the general election.\r\nI ought not to have been shocked at the confidence of this man; though\r\nit was remarkable, considering what had passed between him and me on a\r\nformer occasion--These visits are mere matter of form, which a candidate\r\nmakes to every elector; even to those who, he knows, are engaged in\r\nthe interest of his competitor, lest he should expose himself to the\r\nimputation of pride, at a time when it is expected he should appear\r\nhumble. Indeed, I know nothing so abject as the behaviour of a\r\nman canvassing for a seat in parliament--This mean prostration (to\r\nborough-electors, especially) has, I imagine, contributed in a great\r\nmeasure to raise that spirit of insolence among the vulgar; which, like\r\nthe devil, will be found very difficult to lay. Be that as it may, I was\r\nin some confusion at the effrontery of Fitzowen; but I soon recollected\r\nmyself, and told him, I had not yet determined for whom I should give my\r\nvote, nor whether I should give it for any.--The truth is, I look upon\r\nboth candidates in the same light; and should think myself a traitor to\r\nthe constitution of my country, if I voted for either. If every elector\r\nwould bring the same consideration home to his conscience, we should not\r\nhave such reason to exclaim against the venality of p--ts. But we all\r\nare a pack of venal and corrupted rascals; so lost to all sense of\r\nhonesty, and all tenderness of character, that, in a little time, I am\r\nfully persuaded, nothing will be infamous but virtue and public-spirit.\r\n\r\nG. H--, who is really an enthusiast in patriotism, and represented the\r\ncapital in several successive parliaments, declared to me t’other day,\r\nwith the tears in his eyes, that he had lived above thirty years in the\r\ncity of London, and dealt in the way of commerce with all the citizens\r\nof note in their turns; but that, as he should answer to God, he had\r\nnever, in the whole course of his life, found above three or four\r\nwhom he could call thoroughly honest: a declaration which was rather\r\nmortifying than surprising to me; who have found so few men of worth\r\nin the course of my acquaintance, that they serve only as exceptions;\r\nwhich, in the grammarian’s phrase, confirm and prove a general canon--I\r\nknow you will say, G. H-- saw imperfectly through the mist of prejudice,\r\nand I am rankled by the spleen--Perhaps, you are partly in the right;\r\nfor I have perceived that my opinion of mankind, like mercury in the\r\nthermometer, rises and falls according to the variations of the weather.\r\n\r\nPray settle accompts with Barnes; take what money of mine is in his\r\nhands, and give him acquittance. If you think Davis has stock or credit\r\nenough to do justice to the farm, give him a discharge for the rent that\r\nis due, this will animate his industry; for I know that nothing is so\r\ndiscouraging to a farmer as the thoughts of being in arrears with his\r\nlandlord. He becomes dispirited, and neglects his labour; and so the\r\nfarm goes to wreck. Tabby has been clamouring for some days about the\r\nlamb’s skin, which Williams, the hind, begged of me, when he was last at\r\nBath. Prithee take it back, paying the fellow the full value of it, that\r\nI may have some peace in my own house; and let him keep his own counsel,\r\nif he means to keep his place--O! I shall never presume to despise or\r\ncensure any poor man, for suffering himself to be henpecked; conscious\r\nhow I myself am obliged to truckle to a domestic demon; even though\r\n(blessed be God) she is not yoked with me for life, in the matrimonial\r\nwaggon--She has quarrelled with the servants of the house about vails;\r\nand such intolerable scolding ensued on both sides, that I have been\r\nfain to appease the cook and chambermaid by stealth. Can’t you find some\r\npoor gentleman of Wales, to take this precious commodity off the hands\r\nof\r\n\r\nYours, MATT. BRAMBLE BATH, May 19.\r\n\nTo Dr LEWIS.\r\n\r\nDOCTER LEWS,\r\n\r\nGive me leaf to tell you, methinks you mought employ your talons better,\r\nthan to encourage servants to pillage their masters. I find by Gwyllim,\r\nthat Villiams has got my skin; for which he is an impotent rascal. He\r\nhas not only got my skin, but, moreover, my butter-milk to fatten his\r\npigs; and, I suppose, the next thing he gets, will be my pad to carry\r\nhis daughter to church and fair: Roger gets this, and Roger gets\r\nthat; but I’d have you to know, I won’t be rogered at this rate by any\r\nragmatical fellow in the kingdom--And I am surprised, docter Lews, you\r\nwould offer to put my affairs in composition with the refuge and skim\r\nof the hearth. I have toiled and moyled to a good purpuss, for the\r\nadvantage of Matt’s family, if I can’t safe as much owl as will make me\r\nan under petticoat. As for the butter-milk, ne’er a pig in the parish\r\nshall thrust his snout in it, with my good-will. There’s a famous\r\nphysician at the Hot Well, that prescribes it to his patience, when\r\nthe case is consumptive; and the Scots and Irish have begun to drink it\r\nalready, in such quantities, that there is not a drop left for the\r\nhogs in the whole neighbourhood of Bristol. I’ll have our butter-milk\r\nbarrelled up, and sent twice a-week to Aberginny, where it may be sold\r\nfor a half-penny the quart; and so Roger may carry his pigs to another\r\nmarket--I hope, Docter, you will not go to put any more such phims in my\r\nbrother’s head, to the prejudice of my pockat; but rather give me some\r\nraisins (which hitherto you have not done) to subscribe myself\r\n\r\nYour humble servant, TAB. BRAMBLE BATH, May 19.\r\n\nTo Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of Jesus college, Oxon.\r\n\r\nDEAR PHILLIPS,\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for your answer to my last, I proceed to give you an\r\naccount of our journey to London, which has not been wholly barren of\r\nadventure. Tuesday last the ‘squire took his place in a hired coach and\r\nfour, accompanied by his sister and mine, and Mrs Tabby’s maid, Winifrid\r\nJenkins, whose province it was to support Chowder on a cushion in\r\nher lap. I could scarce refrain from laughing when I looked into the\r\nvehicle, and saw that animal sitting opposite to my uncle, like any\r\nother passenger. The squire, ashamed of his situation, blushed to the\r\neyes: and, calling to the postilions to drive on, pulled the glass up in\r\nmy face. I, and his servant, John Thomas, attended them on horseback.\r\n\r\nNothing worth mentioning occurred, till we arrived on the edge of\r\nMarlborough Downs. There one of the four horses fell, in going down\r\nhill at a round trot; and the postilion behind, endeavouring to stop\r\nthe carriage, pulled it on one side into a deep rut, where it was fairly\r\noverturned. I had rode on about two hundred yards before; but, hearing\r\na loud scream, galloped back and dismounted, to give what assistance\r\nwas in my power. When I looked into the coach, I could see nothing\r\ndistinctly, but the nether end of Jenkins, who was kicking her heels and\r\nsqualling with great vociferation. All of a sudden, my uncle thrust\r\nup his bare pate, and bolted through the window, as nimble as a\r\ngrasshopper, having made use of poor Win’s posteriors as a step to rise\r\nin his ascent--The man (who had likewise quitted his horse) dragged this\r\nforlorn damsel, more dead than alive, through the same opening. Then\r\nMr Bramble, pulling the door off its hinges with a jerk, laid hold\r\non Liddy’s arm, and brought her to the light; very much frighted, but\r\nlittle hurt. It fell to my share to deliver our aunt Tabitha, who had\r\nlost her cap in the struggle, and being rather more than half frantic,\r\nwith rage and terror, was no bad representation of one of the sister\r\nFuries that guard the gates of hell--She expressed no sort of concern\r\nfor her brother, who ran about in the cold, without his periwig, and\r\nworked with the most astonishing agility, in helping to disentangle\r\nthe horses from the carriage: but she cried, in a tone of distraction,\r\n‘Chowder! Chowder! my dear Chowder! my poor Chowder is certainly\r\nkilled!’\r\n\r\nThis was not the case--Chowder, after having tore my uncle’s leg in the\r\nconfusion of the fall, had retreated under the scat, and from thence the\r\nfootman drew him by the neck; for which good office, he bit his fingers\r\nto the bone. The fellow, who is naturally surly, was so provoked at this\r\nassault, that he saluted his ribs with a hearty kick, exclaiming, ‘Damn\r\nthe nasty son of a bitch, and them he belongs to!’ A benediction,\r\nwhich was by no means lost upon the implacable virago his mistress--Her\r\nbrother, however, prevailed upon her to retire into a peasant’s house,\r\nnear the scene of action, where his head and hers were covered, and poor\r\nJenkins had a fit. Our next care was to apply some sticking plaister to\r\nthe wound in his leg, which exhibited the impression of Chowder’s teeth;\r\nbut he never opened his lips against the delinquent--Mrs Tabby, alarmed\r\nat this scene, ‘You say nothing, Matt (cried she); but I know your\r\nmind--I know the spite you have to that poor unfortunate animal! I know\r\nyou intend to take his life away!’ ‘You are mistaken, upon my honour!\r\n(replied the squire, with a sarcastic smile) I should be incapable\r\nof harbouring any such cruel design against an object so amiable and\r\ninoffensive; even if he had not the happiness to be your favourite.’\r\n\r\nJohn Thomas was not so delicate. The fellow, whether really alarmed for\r\nhis life, or instigated by the desire of revenge, came in, and bluntly\r\ndemanded, that the dog should be put to death; on the supposition, that\r\nif ever he should run mad hereafter, he, who had been bit by him, would\r\nbe infected--My uncle calmly argued upon the absurdity of his opinion,\r\nobserving, that he himself was in the same predicament, and would\r\ncertainly take the precaution he proposed, if he was not sure he ran no\r\nrisque of infection. Nevertheless, Thomas continued obstinate; and, at\r\nlength declared, that if the dog was not shot immediately, he himself\r\nwould be his executioner--This declaration opened the flood-gates of\r\nTabby’s eloquence, which would have shamed the first-rate oratress of\r\nBillingsgate. The footman retorted in the same stile; and the squire\r\ndismissed him from his service, after having prevented me from giving\r\nhim a good horse-whipping for his insolence.\r\n\r\nThe coach being adjusted, another difficulty occurred--Mrs Tabitha\r\nabsolutely refused to enter it again, unless another driver could\r\nbe found to take the place of the postilion; who, she affirmed, had\r\noverturned the carriage from malice aforethought--After much dispute,\r\nthe man resigned his place to a shabby country fellow, who undertook to\r\ngo as far as Marlborough, where they could be better provided; and at\r\nthat place we arrived about one O’clock, without farther impediment. Mrs\r\nBramble, however, found new matter of offence; which, indeed, she has a\r\nparticular genius for extracting at will from almost every incident in\r\nlife. We had scarce entered the room at Marlborough, where we stayed to\r\ndine, when she exhibited a formal complaint against the poor fellow who\r\nhad superseded the postilion. She said he was such a beggarly rascal\r\nthat he had ne’er a shirt to his back, and had the impudence to shock\r\nher sight by shewing his bare posteriors, for which act of indelicacy\r\nhe deserved to be set in the stocks. Mrs Winifred Jenkins confirmed the\r\nassertion, with respect to his nakedness, observing, at the same time,\r\nthat he had a skin as fair as alabaster.\r\n\r\n‘This is a heinous offence, indeed (cried my uncle) let us hear what the\r\nfellow has to say in his own vindication.’ He was accordingly summoned,\r\nand made his appearance, which was equally queer and pathetic. He seemed\r\nto be about twenty years of age, of a middling size, with bandy legs,\r\nstooping shoulders, high forehead, sandy locks, pinking eyes, flat nose,\r\nand long chin--but his complexion was of a sickly yellow; his looks\r\ndenoted famine, and the rags that he wore could hardly conceal\r\nwhat decency requires to be covered--My uncle, having surveyed him\r\nattentively, said, with an ironical expression in his countenance, ‘An’t\r\nyou ashamed, fellow, to ride postilion without a shirt to cover your\r\nbackside from the view of the ladies in the coach?’ ‘Yes, I am, an\r\nplease your noble honour (answered the man) but necessity has no law,\r\nas the saying is--And more than that, it was an accident. My breeches\r\ncracked behind, after I had got into the saddle’ ‘You’re an impudent\r\nvarlet (cried Mrs Tabby) for presuming to ride before persons of fashion\r\nwithout a shirt’--‘I am so, an please your worthy ladyship (said he)\r\nbut I am a poor Wiltshire lad--I ha’n’t a shirt in the world, that I can\r\ncall my own, nor a rag of clothes, and please your ladyship, but what\r\nyou see--I have no friend nor relation upon earth to help me out--I\r\nhave had the fever and ague these six months, and spent all I had in the\r\nworld upon doctors, and to keep soul and body together; and, saving\r\nyour ladyship’s good presence, I han’t broke bread these four and twenty\r\nhours.’\r\n\r\nMrs Bramble, turning from him, said, she had never seen such a filthy\r\ntatterdemalion, and bid him begone; observing, that he would fill the\r\nroom full of vermin--Her brother darted a significant glance at her, as\r\nshe retired with Liddy into another apartment, and then asked the man if\r\nhe was known to any person in Marlborough?--When he answered, that\r\nthe landlord of the inn had known him from his infancy; mine host was\r\nimmediately called, and being interrogated on the subject, declared that\r\nthe young fellow’s name was Humphry Clinker. That he had been a love\r\nbegotten babe, brought up in the work-house, and put out apprentice by\r\nthe parish to a country black-smith, who died before the boy’s time was\r\nout: that he had for some time worked under his ostler, as a helper and\r\nextra postilion, till he was taken ill of the ague, which disabled him\r\nfrom getting his bread: that, having sold or pawned every thing he had\r\nin the world for his cure and subsistence, he became so miserable and\r\nshabby, that he disgraced the stable, and was dismissed; but that\r\nhe never heard any thing to the prejudice of his character in other\r\nrespects. ‘So that the fellow being sick and destitute (said my uncle)\r\nyou turned him out to die in the streets.’ ‘I pay the poor’s rate\r\n(replied the other) and I have no right to maintain idle vagrants,\r\neither in sickness or health; besides, such a miserable object would\r\nhave brought a discredit upon my house.’\r\n\r\n‘You perceive (said the ‘squire, turning to me) our landlord is a\r\nChristian of bowels--Who shall presume to censure the morals of the age,\r\nwhen the very publicans exhibit such examples of humanity?--Heark ye,\r\nClinker, you are a most notorious offender--You stand convicted of\r\nsickness, hunger, wretchedness, and want--But, as it does not belong to\r\nme to punish criminals, I will only take upon me the task of giving you\r\na word of advice. Get a shirt with all convenient dispatch, that your\r\nnakedness may not henceforward give offence to travelling gentlewomen,\r\nespecially maidens in years.’\r\n\r\nSo saying, he put a guinea into the hand of the poor fellow, who stood\r\nstaring at him in silence, with his mouth wide open, till the landlord\r\npushed him out of the room.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, as our aunt stept into the coach, she observed, with\r\nsome marks of satisfaction, that the postilion, who rode next to\r\nher, was not a shabby wretch like the ragamuffin who had them into\r\nMarlborough. Indeed, the difference was very conspicuous: this was a\r\nsmart fellow, with a narrow brimmed hat, with gold cording, a cut bob,\r\na decent blue jacket, leather-breaches, and a clean linen shirt, puffed\r\nabove the waist-band. When we arrived at the Castle, on Spin-hill, where\r\nwe lay, this new postilion was remarkably assiduous in bringing in the\r\nloose parcels; and, at length, displayed the individual countenance\r\nof Humphry Clinker, who had metamorphosed himself in this manner, by\r\nrelieving from pawn part of his own clothes, with the money he had\r\nreceived from Mr Bramble.\r\n\r\nHowsoever pleased the rest of the company were with such a favourable\r\nchange in the appearance of this poor creature it soured on the\r\nstomach of Mrs Tabby, who had not yet digested the affront of his naked\r\nskin--She tossed her nose in disdain, saying, she supposed her brother\r\nhad taken him into favour, because he had insulted her with his\r\nobscenity: that a fool and his money were soon parted; but that if Matt\r\nintended to take the fellow with him to London, she would not go a foot\r\nfurther that way--My uncle said nothing with his tongue, though his\r\nlooks were sufficiently expressive; and next morning Clinker did not\r\nappear, so that we proceeded without further altercation to Salthill,\r\nwhere we proposed to dine--There, the first person that came to the\r\nside of the coach, and began to adjust the footboard, was no other than\r\nHumphry Clinker--When I handed out Mrs Bramble, she eyed him with a\r\nfurious look, and passed into the house--My uncle was embarrassed, and\r\nasked him peevishly, what had brought him hither? The fellow said, his\r\nhonour had been so good to him, that he had not the heart to part with\r\nhim; that he would follow him to the world’s end, and serve him all the\r\ndays of his life, without fee or reward.\r\n\r\nMr Bramble did not know whether to chide or laugh at this\r\ndeclaration--He foresaw much contradiction on the side of Tabby; and\r\non the other hand, he could not but be pleased with the gratitude of\r\nClinker, as well as with the simplicity of his character--‘Suppose I\r\nwas inclined to take you into my service (said he) what are your\r\nqualifications? what are you good for?’ ‘An please your honour (answered\r\nthis original) I can read and write, and do the business of the stable\r\nindifferent well--I can dress a horse, and shoe him, and bleed and rowel\r\nhim; and, as for the practice of sow-gelding, I won’t turn my back on\r\ne’er a he in the county of Wilts--Then I can make hog’s puddings and\r\nhob-nails, mend kettles and tin sauce-pans.’--Here uncle burst out\r\na-laughing; and inquired what other accomplishments he was master of--‘I\r\nknow something of single-stick, and psalmody (proceeded Clinker); I can\r\nplay upon the jew’s-harp, sing Black-ey’d Susan, Arthur-o’Bradley, and\r\ndivers other songs; I can dance a Welsh jig, and Nancy Dawson; wrestle a\r\nfall with any lad of my inches, when I’m in heart; and, under correction\r\nI can find a hare when your honour wants a bit of game.’ ‘Foregad! thou\r\nare a complete fellow (cried my uncle, still laughing) I have a good\r\nmind to take thee into my family--Prithee, go and try if thou can’st\r\nmake peace with my sister--Thou ha’st given her much offence by shewing\r\nher thy naked tail.’\r\n\r\nClinker accordingly followed us into the room, cap in hand, where,\r\naddressing himself to Mrs Tabitha, ‘May it please your ladyship’s\r\nworship (cried he) to pardon and forgive my offences, and, with God’s\r\nassistance, I shall take care that my tail shall never rise up in\r\njudgment against me, to offend your ladyship again. Do, pray, good,\r\nsweet, beautiful lady, take compassion on a poor sinner--God bless your\r\nnoble countenance; I am sure you are too handsome and generous to bear\r\nmalice--I will serve you on my bended knees, by night and by day, by\r\nland and by water; and all for the love and pleasure of serving such an\r\nexcellent lady.’\r\n\r\nThis compliment and humiliation had some effect upon Tabby; but she made\r\nno reply; and Clinker, taking silence for consent, gave his attendance\r\nat dinner. The fellow’s natural aukwardness and the flutter of his\r\nspirits were productive of repeated blunders in the course of his\r\nattendance--At length, he spilt part of a custard upon her right\r\nshoulder; and, starting back, trod upon Chowder, who set up a dismal\r\nhowl--Poor Humphry was so disconcerted at this double mistake, that he\r\ndropt the china dish, which broke into a thousand pieces; then, falling\r\ndown upon his knees, remained in that posture gaping, with a most\r\nludicrous aspect of distress. Mrs Bramble flew to the dog, and,\r\nsnatching him in her arms, presented him to her brother saying, ‘This is\r\nall a concerted scheme against this unfortunate animal, whose only crime\r\nis its regard for me--Here it is, kill it at once, and then you’ll be\r\nsatisfied.’\r\n\r\nClinker, hearing these words, and taking them in the literal\r\nacceptation, got up in some hurry, and seizing a knife from the\r\nside-board, cried, ‘Not here, an please your ladyship--It will daub the\r\nroom--Give him to me, and I’ll carry him to the ditch by the roadside’\r\nTo this proposal he received no other answer, than a hearty box on the\r\near, that made him stagger to the other side of the room. ‘What! (said\r\nshe to her brother) am I to be affronted by every mangy hound that you\r\npick up on the highway? I insist upon your sending this rascallion about\r\nhis business immediately’ ‘For God’s sake, sister, compose yourself\r\n(said my uncle) and consider that the poor fellow is innocent of any\r\nintention to give you offence’ ‘Innocent as the babe unborn’ (cried\r\nHumphry). ‘I see it plainly (exclaimed this implacable maiden), he acts\r\nby your direction; and you are resolved to support him in his impudence\r\nThis is a bad return for all the services I have done you; for nursing\r\nyou in your sickness, managing your family, and keeping you from ruining\r\nyourself by your own imprudence--But now you shall part with that rascal\r\nor me, upon the spot, without farther loss of time; and the world shall\r\nsee whether you have more regard for your own flesh and blood, or for a\r\nbeggarly foundling taken from the dunghill.’\r\n\r\nMr Bramble’s eyes began to glisten, and his teeth to chatter. ‘If stated\r\nfairly (said he, raising his voice) the question is, whether I have\r\nspirit to shake off an intolerable yoke, by one effort of resolution,\r\nor meanness enough to do an act of cruelty and injustice, to gratify the\r\nrancour of a capricious woman--Heark ye, Mrs Tabitha Bramble, I will\r\nnow propose an alternative in my turn. Either discard your four-footed\r\nfavourite, or give me leave to bid you eternally adieu--For I am\r\ndetermined that he and I shall live no longer under the same roof;\r\nand to dinner with what appetite you may’--Thunderstruck at this\r\ndeclaration, she sat down in a corner; and, after a pause of some\r\nminutes, ‘Sure I don’t understand you, Matt! (said she)’ ‘And yet I\r\nspoke in plain English’ answered the ‘squire, with a peremptory look.\r\n‘Sir (resumed this virago, effectually humbled), it is your prerogative\r\nto command, and my duty to obey. I can’t dispose of the dog in this\r\nplace; but if you’ll allow him to go in the coach to London, I give you\r\nmy word, he shall never trouble you again.’\r\n\r\nHer brother, entirely disarmed by this mild reply, declared, she could\r\nask him nothing in reason that he would refuse; adding, ‘I hope, sister,\r\nyou have never found me deficient in natural affection.’\r\n\r\nMrs Tabitha immediately rose, and, throwing her arms about his neck,\r\nkissed him on the cheek: he returned her embrace with great emotion.\r\nLiddy sobbed, Win. Jenkins cackled, Chowder capered, and Clinker skipped\r\nabout, rubbing his hands for joy of this reconciliation.\r\n\r\nConcord being thus restored, we finished our meal with comfort; and\r\nin the evening arrived at London, without having met with any other\r\nadventure. My aunt seems to be much mended by the hint she received from\r\nher brother. She has been graciously pleased to remove her displeasure\r\nfrom Clinker, who is now retained as a footman; and in a day or two\r\nwill make his appearance in a new suit of livery; but as he is little\r\nacquainted with London, we have taken an occasional valet, whom I intend\r\nhereafter to hire as my own servant. We lodge in Goldensquare, at the\r\nhouse of one Mrs Notion, a decent sort of a woman, who takes great pains\r\nto make us all easy. My uncle proposes to make a circuit of all the\r\nremarkable scenes of this metropolis, for the entertainment of his\r\npupils; but as both you and I are already acquainted with most of those\r\nhe will visit, and with some others he little dreams of, I shall only\r\ncommunicate what will be in some measure new to your observation.\r\nRemember me to our Jesuitical friends, and believe me ever,\r\n\r\nDear knight, Yours affectionately, J. MELFORD LONDON, May 24.\r\n\nTo Dr LEWIS.\r\n\r\nDEAR DOCTOR,\r\n\r\nLondon is literally new to me; new in its streets, houses, and even in\r\nits situation; as the Irishman said, ‘London is now gone out of town.’\r\nWhat I left open fields, producing hay and corn, I now find covered with\r\nstreets and squares, and palaces, and churches. I am credibly informed,\r\nthat in the space of seven years, eleven thousand new houses have been\r\nbuilt in one quarter of Westminster, exclusive of what is daily added to\r\nother parts of this unwieldy metropolis. Pimlico and Knightsbridge are\r\nnow almost joined to Chelsea and Kensington; and if this infatuation\r\ncontinues for half a century, I suppose the whole county of Middlesex\r\nwill be covered with brick.\r\n\r\nIt must be allowed, indeed, for the credit of the present age, that\r\nLondon and Westminster are much better paved and lighted than they\r\nwere formerly. The new streets are spacious, regular, and airy; and\r\nthe houses generally convenient. The bridge at Blackfriars is a noble\r\nmonument of taste and public-spirit.--I wonder how they stumbled upon\r\na work of such magnificence and utility. But, notwithstanding these\r\nimprovements, the capital is become an overgrown monster; which, like\r\na dropsical head, will in time leave the body and extremities without\r\nnourishment and support. The absurdity will appear in its full force,\r\nwhen we consider that one sixth part of the natives of this whole\r\nextensive kingdom is crowded within the bills of mortality. What\r\nwonder that our villages are depopulated, and our farms in want of\r\nday-labourers? The abolition of small farms is but one cause of the\r\ndecrease of population. Indeed, the incredible increase of horses and\r\nblack cattle, to answer the purposes of luxury, requires a prodigious\r\nquantity of hay and grass, which are raised and managed without much\r\nlabour; but a number of hands will always be wanted for the different\r\nbranches of agriculture, whether the farms be large or small. The tide\r\nof luxury has swept all the inhabitants from the open country--The\r\npoorest squire, as well as the richest peer, must have his house in\r\ntown, and make a figure with an extraordinary number of domestics. The\r\nplough-boys, cow-herds, and lower hinds are debauched and seduced by\r\nthe appearance and discourse of those coxcombs in livery, when they make\r\ntheir summer excursions. They desert their dirt and drudgery, and swarm\r\nup to London, in hopes of getting into service, where they can live\r\nluxuriously and wear fine clothes, without being obliged to work; for\r\nidleness is natural to man--Great numbers of these, being disappointed\r\nin their expectation, become thieves and sharpers; and London being\r\nan immense wilderness, in which there is neither watch nor ward of any\r\nsignification, nor any order or police, affords them lurking-places as\r\nwell as prey.\r\n\r\nThere are many causes that contribute to the daily increase of this\r\nenormous mass; but they may be all resolved into the grand source of\r\nluxury and corruption--About five and twenty years ago, very few, even\r\nof the most opulent citizens of London, kept any equipage, or even any\r\nservants in livery. Their tables produced nothing but plain boiled and\r\nroasted, with a bottle of port and a tankard of beer. At present, every\r\ntrader in any degree of credit, every broker and attorney, maintains a\r\ncouple of footmen, a coachman, and postilion. He has his town-house,\r\nand his country-house, his coach, and his post-chaise. His wife and\r\ndaughters appear in the richest stuffs, bespangled with diamonds. They\r\nfrequent the court, the opera, the theatre, and the masquerade. They\r\nhold assemblies at their own houses: they make sumptuous entertainments,\r\nand treat with the richest wines of Bordeaux, Burgundy, and Champagne.\r\nThe substantial tradesman, who wont to pass his evenings at the\r\nale-house for fourpence half-penny, now spends three shillings at the\r\ntavern, while his wife keeps card-tables at home; she must likewise have\r\nfine clothes, her chaise, or pad, with country lodgings, and go three\r\ntimes a week to public diversions. Every clerk, apprentice, and even\r\nwaiter of tavern or coffeehouse, maintains a gelding by himself, or\r\nin partnership, and assumes the air and apparel of a petit maitre--The\r\ngayest places of public entertainment are filled with fashionable\r\nfigures; which, upon inquiry, will be found to be journeymen taylors,\r\nserving-men, and abigails, disguised like their betters.\r\n\r\nIn short, there is no distinction or subordination left--The different\r\ndepartments of life are jumbled together--The hod-carrier, the low\r\nmechanic, the tapster, the publican, the shopkeeper, the pettifogger,\r\nthe citizen, and courtier, all tread upon the kibes of one another:\r\nactuated by the demons of profligacy and licentiousness, they are\r\nseen every where rambling, riding, rolling, rushing, justling, mixing,\r\nbouncing, cracking, and crashing in one vile ferment of stupidity\r\nand corruption--All is tumult and hurry; one would imagine they were\r\nimpelled by some disorder of the brain, that will not suffer them to\r\nbe at rest. The foot-passengers run along as if they were pursued by\r\nbailiffs. The porters and chairmen trot with their burthens. People, who\r\nkeep their own equipages, drive through the streets at full speed. Even\r\ncitizens, physicians, and apothecaries, glide in their chariots like\r\nlightening. The hackney-coachmen make their horses smoke, and the\r\npavement shakes under them; and I have actually seen a waggon pass\r\nthrough Piccadilly at the hand-gallop. In a word, the whole nation seems\r\nto be running out of their wits.\r\n\r\nThe diversions of the times are not ill suited to the genius of this\r\nincongruous monster, called the public. Give it noise, confusion, glare,\r\nand glitter; it has no idea of elegance and propriety--What are the\r\namusements of Ranelagh? One half of the company are following at the\r\nother’s tails, in an eternal circle; like so many blind asses in an\r\nolive-mill, where they can neither discourse, distinguish, nor be\r\ndistinguished; while the other half are drinking hot water, under the\r\ndenomination of tea, till nine or ten o’clock at night, to keep them\r\nawake for the rest of the evening. As for the orchestra, the vocal music\r\nespecially, it is well for the performers that they cannot be heard\r\ndistinctly. Vauxhall is a composition of baubles, overcharged with\r\npaltry ornaments, ill conceived, and poorly executed; without any unity\r\nof design, or propriety of disposition. It is an unnatural assembly of\r\nobjects, fantastically illuminated in broken masses; seemingly contrived\r\nto dazzle the eyes and divert the imagination of the vulgar--Here a\r\nwooden lion, there a stone statue; in one place, a range of things like\r\ncoffeehouse boxes, covered a-top; in another, a parcel of ale-house\r\nbenches; in a third, a puppet-show representation of a tin cascade; in\r\na fourth, a gloomy cave of a circular form, like a sepulchral vault half\r\nlighted; in a fifth, a scanty flip of grass-plat, that would not afford\r\npasture sufficient for an ass’s colt. The walks, which nature seems to\r\nhave intended for solitude, shade, and silence, are filled with crowds\r\nof noisy people, sucking up the nocturnal rheums of an aguish climate;\r\nand through these gay scenes, a few lamps glimmer like so many farthing\r\ncandles.\r\n\r\nWhen I see a number of well dressed people, of both sexes, sitting\r\non the covered benches, exposed to the eyes of the mob; and, which is\r\nworse, to the cold, raw, night-air, devouring sliced beef, and swilling\r\nport, and punch, and cyder, I can’t help compassionating their temerity;\r\nwhile I despise their want of taste and decorum; but, when they course\r\nalong those damp and gloomy walks, or crowd together upon the wet\r\ngravel, without any other cover than the cope of Heaven, listening to\r\na song, which one half of them cannot possibly hear, how can I help\r\nsupposing they are actually possessed by a spirit, more absurd and\r\npernicious than any thing we meet with in the precincts of Bedlam? In\r\nall probability, the proprietors of this, and other public gardens of\r\ninferior note, in the skirts of the metropolis, are, in some shape,\r\nconnected with the faculty of physic, and the company of undertakers;\r\nfor, considering that eagerness in the pursuit of what is called\r\npleasure, which now predominates through every rank and denomination\r\nof life, I am persuaded that more gouts, rheumatisms, catarrhs, and\r\nconsumptions are caught in these nocturnal pastimes, sub dio, than from\r\nall the risques and accidents to which a life of toil and danger is\r\nexposed.\r\n\r\nThese, and other observations, which I have made in this excursion, will\r\nshorten my stay at London, and send me back with a double relish to my\r\nsolitude and mountains; but I shall return by a different route from\r\nthat which brought me to town. I have seen some old friends, who\r\nconstantly resided in this virtuous metropolis, but they are so\r\nchanged in manners and disposition, that we hardly know or care for one\r\nanother--In our journey from Bath, my sister Tabby provoked me into a\r\ntransport of passion; during which, like a man who has drank himself\r\npot-valiant, I talked to her in such a stile of authority and\r\nresolution, as produced a most blessed effect. She and her dog have been\r\nremarkably quiet and orderly ever since this expostulation. How long\r\nthis agreeable calm will last, Heaven above knows--I flatter myself, the\r\nexercise of travelling has been of service to my health; a circumstance\r\nwhich encourages me to-proceed in my projected expedition to the North.\r\nBut I must, in the mean time, for the benefit and amusement of my\r\npupils, explore the depths of this chaos; this misshapen and monstrous\r\ncapital, without head or tail, members or proportion.\r\n\r\nThomas was so insolent to my sister on the road, that I was obliged to\r\nturn him off abruptly, betwixt Chippenham and Marlborough, where our\r\ncoach was overturned. The fellow was always sullen and selfish; but,\r\nif he should return to the country, you may give him a character for\r\nhonesty and sobriety; and, provided he behaves with proper respect to\r\nthe family, let him have a couple of guineas in the name of\r\n\r\nYours always, MATT. BRAMBLE LONDON, May 20.\r\n\nTo Miss LAETITIA WILLIS, at Gloucester.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR LETTY,\r\n\r\nInexpressible was the pleasure I received from yours of the 25th, which\r\nwas last night put into my hands by Mrs Brentford, the milliner, from\r\nGloucester--I rejoice to hear that my worthy governess is in good\r\nhealth, and, still more, that she no longer retains any displeasure\r\ntowards her poor Liddy. I am sorry you have lost the society of the\r\nagreeable Miss Vaughn; but, I hope you won’t have cause much longer to\r\nregret the departure of your school companions, as I make no doubt but\r\nyour parents will, in a little time, bring you into the world, where you\r\nare so well qualified to make a distinguished figure. When that is\r\nthe case, I flatter myself you and I shall meet again, and be happy\r\ntogether; and even improve the friendship which we contracted in our\r\ntender years. This at least I can promise--It shall not be for the want\r\nof my utmost endeavours, if our intimacy does not continue for life.\r\n\r\nAbout five days ago we arrived in London, after an easy journey from\r\nBath; during which, however, we were overturned, and met with some other\r\nlittle incidents, which, had like to have occasioned a misunderstanding\r\nbetwixt my uncle and aunt; but now, thank God, they are happily\r\nreconciled: we live in harmony together, and every day make parties\r\nto see the wonders of this vast metropolis, which, however, I cannot\r\npretend to describe; for I have not as yet seen one hundredth part of\r\nits curiosities, and I am quite in a maze of admiration.\r\n\r\nThe cities of London and Westminster are spread out into an incredible\r\nextent. The streets, squares, rows, lanes, and alleys, are innumerable.\r\nPalaces, public buildings, and churches rise in every quarter;\r\nand, among these last, St Paul’s appears with the most astonishing\r\npre-eminence. They say it is not so large as, St Peter’s at Rome; but,\r\nfor my own part, I can have no idea of any earthly temple more grand and\r\nmagnificent.\r\n\r\nBut even these superb objects are not so striking as the crowds of\r\npeople that swarm in the streets. I at first imagined that some\r\ngreat assembly was just dismissed, and wanted to stand aside till the\r\nmultitude should pass; but this human tide continues to flow, without\r\ninterruption or abatement, from morn till night. Then there is such\r\nan infinity of gay equipages, coaches, chariots, chaises, and other\r\ncarriages, continually rolling and shifting before your eyes, that\r\none’s head grows giddy looking at them; and the imagination is quite\r\nconfounded with splendour and variety. Nor is the prospect by water\r\nless grand and astonishing than that by land: you see three stupendous\r\nbridges, joining the opposite banks of a broad, deep, and rapid river;\r\nso vast, so stately, so elegant, that they seem to be the work of the\r\ngiants; betwixt them, the whole surface of the Thames is covered with\r\nsmall vessels, barges, boats, and wherries, passing to and fro; and\r\nbelow the three bridges, such a prodigious forest of masts, for miles\r\ntogether, that you would think all the ships in the universe were here\r\nassembled. All that you read of wealth and grandeur in the Arabian\r\nNights’ Entertainment, and the Persian Tales, concerning Bagdad,\r\nDiarbekir, Damascus, Ispahan, and Samarkand, is here realized.\r\n\r\nRanelagh looks like the inchanted palace of a genie, adorned with\r\nthe most exquisite performances of painting, carving, and gilding,\r\nenlightened with a thousand golden lamps, that emulate the noon-day\r\nsun; crowded with the great, the rich, the gay, the happy, and the fair;\r\nglittering with cloth of gold and silver, lace, embroidery, and precious\r\nstones. While these exulting sons and daughters of felicity tread this\r\nround of pleasure, or regale in different parties, and separate lodges,\r\nwith fine imperial tea and other delicious refreshments, their ears are\r\nentertained with the most ravishing delights of music, both instrumental\r\nand vocal. There I heard the famous Tenducci, a thing from Italy--It\r\nlooks for all the world like a man, though they say it is not. The\r\nvoice, to be sure, is neither man’s nor woman’s; but it is more\r\nmelodious than either; and it warbled so divinely, that, while I\r\nlistened, I really thought myself in paradise.\r\n\r\nAt nine o’clock, in a charming moonlight evening, we embarked at\r\nRanelagh for Vauxhall, in a wherry so light and slender that we looked\r\nlike so many fairies sailing in a nutshell. My uncle, being apprehensive\r\nof catching cold upon the water, went round in the coach, and my aunt\r\nwould have accompanied him, but he would not suffer me to go by water if\r\nshe went by land; and therefore she favoured us with her company, as she\r\nperceived I had a curiosity to make this agreeable voyage--After all,\r\nthe vessel was sufficiently loaded; for, besides the waterman, there\r\nwas my brother Jery, and a friend of his, one Mr Barton, a country\r\ngentleman, of a good fortune, who had dined at our house--The pleasure\r\nof this little excursion was, however, damped, by my being sadly\r\nfrighted at our landing; where there was a terrible confusion of\r\nwherries and a crowd of people bawling, and swearing, and quarrelling,\r\nnay, a parcel of ugly-looking fellows came running into the water, and\r\nlaid hold of our boat with great violence, to pull it a-shore; nor would\r\nthey quit their hold till my brother struck one of them over the head\r\nwith his cane. But this flutter was fully recompensed by the pleasures\r\nof Vauxhall; which I no sooner entered, than I was dazzled and\r\nconfounded with the variety of beauties that rushed all at once upon my\r\neye. Image to yourself, my dear Letty, a spacious garden, part laid out\r\nin delightful walks, bounded with high hedges and trees, and paved with\r\ngravel; part exhibiting a wonderful assemblage of the most picturesque\r\nand striking objects’ pavilions, lodges, groves, grottoes, lawns,\r\ntemples and cascades; porticoes, colonades, and rotundos; adorned with\r\npillars, statues, and painting: the whole illuminated with an infinite\r\nnumber of lamps, disposed in different figures of suns, stars, and\r\nconstellations; the place crowded with the gayest company, ranging\r\nthrough those blissful shades, or supping in different lodges on cold\r\ncollations, enlivened with mirth, freedom, and good humour, and animated\r\nby an excellent band of music. Among the vocal performers I had the\r\nhappiness to hear the celebrated Mrs--, whose voice was loud and shrill,\r\nthat it made my head ake through excess of pleasure.\r\n\r\nIn about half an hour after we arrived we were joined by my uncle, who\r\ndid not seem to relish the place. People of experience and infirmity, my\r\ndear Letty, see with very different eyes from those that such as you and\r\nI make use of--Our evening’s entertainment was interrupted by an unlucky\r\naccident. In one of the remotest walks we were surprised with a sudden\r\nshower, that set the whole company a-running, and drove us in heaps,\r\none upon another, into the rotunda; where my uncle, finding himself wet,\r\nbegan to be very peevish and urgent to be gone. My brother went to look\r\nfor the coach, and found it with much difficulty; but as it could\r\nnot hold us all, Mr Barton stayed behind. It was some time before\r\nthe carriage could be brought up to the gate, in the confusion,\r\nnotwithstanding the utmost endeavours of our new footman, Humphry\r\nClinker, who lost his scratch periwig, and got a broken head in the\r\nscuffle. The moment we were seated, my aunt pulled off my uncle’s shoes,\r\nand carefully wrapped his poor feet in her capuchin; then she gave him\r\na mouth-ful of cordial, which she always keeps in her pocket, and his\r\nclothes were shifted as soon as we arrived at lodgings; so that, blessed\r\nbe God, he escaped a severe cold, of which he was in great terror.\r\n\r\nAs for Mr Barton, I must tell you in confidence, he was a little\r\nparticular; but, perhaps, I mistake his complaisance; and I wish I may,\r\nfor his sake--You know the condition of my poor heart: which, in spite\r\nof hard usage--And yet I ought not to complain: nor will I, till farther\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nBesides Ranelagh and Vauxhall, I have been at Mrs Cornelys’ assembly,\r\nwhich, for the rooms, the company, the dresses, and decorations,\r\nsurpasses all description; but as I have no great turn for card playing,\r\nI have not yet entered thoroughly into the spirit of the place: indeed I\r\nam still such a country hoyden, that I could hardly find patience to be\r\nput in a condition to appear, yet, as I was not above six hours under\r\nthe hands of the hair-dresser, who stuffed my head with as much black\r\nwool as would have made a quilted petticoat; and, after all, it was the\r\nsmallest head in the assembly, except my aunt’s--She, to be sure, was\r\nso particular with her rumpt gown and petticoat, her scanty curls, her\r\nlappethead, deep triple ruffles, and high stays, that every body looked\r\nat her with surprise: some whispered, and some tittered; and lady\r\nGriskin, by whom we were introduced, flatly told her, she was twenty\r\ngood years behind the fashion.\r\n\r\nLady Griskin is a person of fashion, to whom we have the honour to be\r\nrelated. She keeps a small rout at her own house, never exceeding ten\r\nor a dozen card-tables, but these are frequented by the best company in\r\ntown--She has been so obliging as to introduce my aunt and me to some of\r\nher particular friends of quality, who treat us with the most familiar\r\ngood-humour: we have once dined with her, and she takes the trouble\r\nto direct us in all our motions. I am so happy as to have gained her\r\ngoodwill to such a degree, that she sometimes adjusts my cap with her\r\nown hands; and she has given me a kind invitation to stay with her all\r\nthe winter. This, however, has been cruelly declined by my uncle who\r\nseems to be (I know not how) prejudiced against the good lady; for,\r\nwhenever my aunt happens to speak in her commendation, I observe that he\r\nmakes wry faces, though he says nothing--Perhaps, indeed, these grimaces\r\nmay be the effect of pain arising from the gout and rheumatism, with\r\nwhich he is sadly distressed--To me, however, he is always good-natured\r\nand generous, even beyond my wish. Since we came hither, he has made\r\nme a present of a suit of clothes, with trimmings and laces, which cost\r\nmore money than I shall mention; and Jery, at his desire, has given me\r\nmy mother’s diamond crops, which are ordered to be set a-new; so that it\r\nwon’t be his fault if I do not glitter among the stars of the fourth or\r\nfifth magnitude. I wish my weak head may not grow giddy in the midst\r\nof all this gallantry and dissipation; though, as yet, I can safely\r\ndeclare, I could gladly give up all these tumultuous pleasures, for\r\ncountry solitude, and a happy retreat with those we love; among whom, my\r\ndear Willis will always possess the first place in the breast of her\r\n\r\nEver affectionate, LYDIA MELFORD LONDON, May 31.\r\n\nTo Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of Jesus college, Oxon.\r\n\r\nDEAR PHILLIPS,\r\n\r\nI send you this letter, franked by our old friend Barton; who is as much\r\naltered as it was possible for a man of his kidney to be. Instead of\r\nthe careless, indolent sloven we knew at Oxford, I found him a busy\r\ntalkative politician; a petit-maitre in his dress, and a ceremonious\r\ncourtier in his manners. He has not gall enough in his constitution\r\nto be enflamed with the rancour of party, so as to deal in scurrilous\r\ninvectives; but, since he obtained a place, he is become a warm partizan\r\nof the ministry, and sees every thing through such an exaggerating\r\nmedium, as to me, who am happily of no party, is altogether\r\nincomprehensible--Without all doubt, the fumes of faction not only\r\ndisturb the faculty of reason, but also pervert the organs of sense; and\r\nI would lay a hundred guineas to ten, that if Barton on one side, and\r\nthe most conscientious patriot in the opposition on the other, were to\r\ndraw, upon honour, the picture of the k[ing] or m[inisters], you and I,\r\nwho are still uninfected, and unbiased, would find both painters equally\r\ndistant from the truth. One thing, however, must be allowed for the\r\nhonour of Barton, he never breaks out into illiberal abuse, far less\r\nendeavours, by infamous calumnies, to blast the moral character of any\r\nindividual on the other side.\r\n\r\nEver since we came hither, he has been remarkably assiduous in his\r\nattention to our family; an attention, which, in a man of his indolence\r\nand avocations, I should have thought altogether odd, and even\r\nunnatural, had not I perceived that my sister Liddy had made some\r\nimpression upon his heart. I cannot say that I have any objection to\r\nhis trying his fortune in this pursuit: if an opulent estate and a great\r\nflock of good-nature are sufficient qualifications in a husband, to\r\nrender the marriage-state happy for life, she may be happy with Barton;\r\nbut, I imagine, there is something else required to engage and secure\r\nthe affection of a woman of sense and delicacy: something which nature\r\nhas denied our friend--Liddy seems to be of the same opinion. When\r\nhe addresses himself to her in discourse, she seems to listen with\r\nreluctance, and industriously avoids all particular communication; but\r\nin proportion to her coyness, our aunt is coming. Mrs Tabitha goes more\r\nthan half way to meet his advances; she mistakes, or affects to mistake,\r\nthe meaning of his courtesy, which is rather formal and fulsome; she\r\nreturns his compliments with hyperbolical interest, she persecutes\r\nhim with her civilities at table, she appeals to him for ever in\r\nconversation, she sighs, and flirts, and ogles, and by her hideous\r\naffectation and impertinence, drives the poor courtier to the very\r\nextremity of his complaisance; in short, she seems to have undertaken\r\nthe siege of Barton’s heart, and carries on her approaches in such a\r\ndesperate manner, that I don’t know whether he will not be obliged to\r\ncapitulate. In the mean time, his aversion to this inamorata struggling\r\nwith his acquired affability, and his natural fear of giving offence,\r\nthrows him into a kind of distress which is extremely ridiculous.\r\n\r\nTwo days ago, he persuaded my uncle and me to accompany him to St\r\nJames’s, where he undertook to make us acquainted with the persons\r\nof all the great men in the kingdom; and, indeed, there was a great\r\nassemblage of distinguished characters, for it was a high festival at\r\ncourt. Our conductor performed his promise with great punctuality.\r\nHe pointed out almost every individual of both sexes, and generally\r\nintroduced them to our notice, with a flourish of panegyrick--Seeing the\r\nking approach, ‘There comes (said he) the most amiable sovereign\r\nthat ever swayed the sceptre of England: the delicioe humani generis;\r\nAugustus, in patronizing merit; Titus Vespasian in generosity; Trajan\r\nin beneficence; and Marcus Aurelius in philosophy.’ ‘A very honest kind\r\nhearted gentleman (added my uncle) he’s too good for the times. A king\r\nof England should have a spice of the devil in his composition.’ Barton,\r\nthen turning to the duke of C[umberland], proceeded,--‘You know the\r\nduke, that illustrious hero, who trode rebellion under his feet, and\r\nsecured us in possession of every thing we ought to hold dear, as\r\nEnglish men and Christians. Mark what an eye, how penetrating, yet\r\npacific! what dignity in his mien! what humanity in his aspect--Even\r\nmalice must own, that he is one of the greatest officers in\r\nChristendom.’ ‘I think he is (said Mr Bramble) but who are these young\r\ngentlemen that stand beside him?’ ‘Those! (cried our friend) those are\r\nhis royal nephews; the princes of the blood. Sweet young princes! the\r\nsacred pledges of the Protestant line; so spirited, so sensible,\r\nso princely’--‘Yes; very sensible! very spirited! (said my uncle,\r\ninterrupting him) but see the queen! ha, there’s the queen!--There’s the\r\nqueen! let me see--Let me see--Where are my glasses? ha! there’s meaning\r\nin that eye--There’s sentiment--There’s expression--Well, Mr Barton,\r\nwhat figure do you call next?’ The next person he pointed out, was the\r\nfavourite yearl; who stood solitary by one of the windows--‘Behold\r\nyon northern star (said he) shorn of his beams’--‘What! the Caledonian\r\nluminary, that lately blazed so bright in our hemisphere! methinks, at\r\npresent, it glimmers through a fog; like Saturn without his ring, bleak,\r\nand dim, and distant--Ha, there’s the other great phenomenon, the grand\r\npensionary, that weathercock of patriotism that veers about in every\r\npoint of the political compass, and still feels the wind of popularity\r\nin his tail. He too, like a portentous comet, has risen again above the\r\ncourt-horizon; but how long he will continue to ascend, it is not easy\r\nto foretell, considering his great eccentricity--Who are those two\r\nsatellites that attend his motions?’ When Barton told him their names,\r\n‘To their characters (said Mr Bramble) I am no stranger. One of them,\r\nwithout a drop of red blood in his veins, has a cold intoxicating vapour\r\nin his head; and rancour enough in his heart to inoculate and affect\r\na whole nation. The other is (I hear) intended for a share in the\r\nad[ministratio]n, and the pensionary vouches for his being duly\r\nqualified--The only instance I ever heard of his sagacity, was his\r\ndeserting his former patron, when he found him declining in power, and\r\nin disgrace with the people. Without principle, talent, or intelligence,\r\nhe is ungracious as a hog, greedy as a vulture, and thievish as a\r\njackdaw; but, it must be owned, he is no hypocrite. He pretends to no\r\nvirtue, and takes no pains to disguise his character--His ministry\r\nwill be attended with one advantage, no man will be disappointed by his\r\nbreach of promise, as no mortal ever trusted to his word. I wonder how\r\nlord--first discovered this happy genius, and for what purpose lord--has\r\nnow adopted him: but one would think, that as amber has a power to\r\nattract dirt, and straws, and chaff, a minister is endued with the same\r\nkind of faculty, to lick up every knave and blockhead in his way’--His\r\neulogium was interrupted by the arrival of the old duke of N--; who,\r\nsqueezing into the circle with a busy face of importance, thrust his\r\nhead into every countenance, as if he had been in search of somebody, to\r\nwhom he wanted to impart something of great consequence--My uncle, who\r\nhad been formerly known to him, bowed as he passed; and the duke seeing\r\nhimself saluted so respectfully by a well-dressed person, was not slow\r\nin returning the courtesy--He even came up, and, taking him cordially by\r\nthe hand, ‘My dear friend, Mr A-- (said he) I am rejoiced to see you--\r\nHow long have you been come from abroad?--How did you leave our good\r\nfriends the Dutch? The king of Prussia don’t think of another war,\r\nah?--He’s a great king! a great conqueror! a very great conqueror! Your\r\nAlexanders and Hannibals were nothing, at all to him, sir--Corporals!\r\ndrummers! dross! mere trash--Damned trash, heh?’--His grace being by\r\nthis time out of breath, my uncle took the opportunity to tell him he\r\nhad not been out of England, that his name was Bramble, and that he had\r\nthe honour to sit in the last parliament but one of the late king, as\r\nrepresentative for the borough of Dymkymraig. ‘Odso! (cried the duke) I\r\nremember you perfectly well, my dear Mr Bramble--You was always a\r\ngood and loyal subject--a stanch friend to administration--I made your\r\nbrother an Irish bishop’--‘Pardon me, my lord (said the squire) I once\r\nhad a brother, but he was a captain in the army’--‘Ha! (said his\r\ngrace) he was so--He was, indeed! But who was the Bishop then! Bishop\r\nBlackberry--Sure it was bishop Blackberry. Perhaps some relation of\r\nyours’--‘Very likely, my lord (replied my uncle); the Blackberry is the\r\nfruit of the Bramble--But, I believe, the bishop is not a berry of our\r\nbush’--‘No more he is--No more he is, ha, ha, ha! (exclaimed the duke)\r\nthere you gave me a scratch, good Mr Bramble, ha, ha, ha!--Well,\r\nI shall be glad to see you at Lincoln’s inn-fields--You know the\r\nway--Times are altered. Though I have lost the power, I retain the\r\ninclination--Your very humble servant, good Mr Blackberry’--So saying,\r\nhe shoved to another corner of the room. ‘What a fine old gentleman!\r\n(cried Mr Barton) what spirits! what a memory! He never forgets an old\r\nfriend.’ ‘He does me too much honour (observed our squire) to rank me\r\namong the number--Whilst I sat in parliament, I never voted with the\r\nministry but three times, when my conscience told me they were in the\r\nright: however, if he still keeps levee, I will carry my nephew thither,\r\nthat he may see, and learn to avoid the scene; for, I think, an English\r\ngentleman never appears to such disadvantage, as at the levee of a\r\nminister--Of his grace I shall say nothing at present, but that for\r\nthirty years he was the constant and common butt of ridicule and\r\nexecration. He was generally laughed at as an ape in politics, whose\r\noffice and influence served only to render his folly the more notorious;\r\nand the opposition cursed him, as the indefatigable drudge of a\r\nfirst-mover, who was justly stiled and stigmatized as the father of\r\ncorruption: but this ridiculous ape, this venal drudge, no sooner lost\r\nthe places he was so ill qualified to fill, and unfurled the banners of\r\nfaction, than he was metamorphosed into a pattern of public virtue; the\r\nvery people who reviled him before, now extolled him to the skies, as a\r\nwise, experienced statesman, chief pillar of the Protestant succession,\r\nand corner stone of English liberty. I should be glad to know how Mr\r\nBarton reconciles these contradictions, without obliging us to resign\r\nall title to the privilege of common sense.’ ‘My dear sir (answered\r\nBarton) I don’t pretend to justify the extravagations of the multitude;\r\nwho, I suppose, were as wild in their former censure, as in the present\r\npraise: but I shall be very glad to attend you on Thursday next to his\r\ngrace’s levee; where, I’m afraid, we shall not be crowded with company;\r\nfor, you know, there’s a wide difference between his present office of\r\npresident of the council, and his former post of first lord commissioner\r\nof the treasury.’\r\n\r\nThis communicative friend having announced all the remarkable characters\r\nof both sexes, that appeared at court, we resolved to adjourn, and\r\nretired. At the foot of the stair-case, there was a crowd of lacqueys\r\nand chairmen, and in the midst of them stood Humphry Clinker, exalted\r\nupon a stool, with his hat in one hand, and a paper in the other, in\r\nthe act of holding forth to the people--Before we could inquire into the\r\nmeaning of this exhibition, he perceived his master, thrust the paper\r\ninto his pocket, descended from his elevation, bolted through the crowd,\r\nand brought up the carriage to the gate.\r\n\r\nMy uncle said nothing till we were seated, when, after having looked at\r\nme earnestly for some time, he burst out a-laughing, and asked if I knew\r\nupon what subject Clinker was holding forth to the mob--‘If (said he)\r\nthe fellow is turned mountebank, I must turn him out of my service,\r\notherwise he’ll make Merry Andrews of us all’--I observed, that, in\r\nall probability, he had studied medicine under his master, who was a\r\nfarrier.\r\n\r\nAt dinner, the squire asked him, if he had ever practised physic? ‘Yes,\r\nand please your honour (said he) among brute beasts; but I never meddle\r\nwith rational creatures.’ ‘I know not whether you rank in that class the\r\naudience you was haranguing in the court at St. James’s, but I should be\r\nglad to know what kind of powders you was distributing; and whether you\r\nhad a good sale’--‘Sale, sir! (cried Clinker) I hope I shall never be\r\nbase enough to sell for gold and silver, what freely comes of God’s\r\ngrace. I distributed nothing, an like your honour, but a word of\r\nadvice to my fellows in servitude and sin.’ ‘Advice! concerning what?’\r\n‘Concerning profane swearing, an please your honour; so horrid and\r\nshocking, that it made my hair stand on end.’ ‘Nay, if thou can’st cure\r\nthem Of that disease, I shall think thee a wonderful doctor indeed’ ‘Why\r\nnot cure them, my good master? the hearts of those poor people are not\r\nso stubborn as your honour seems to think--Make them first sensible\r\nthat you have nothing in view but their good, then they will listen with\r\npatience, and easily be convinced of the sin and folly of a practice\r\nthat affords neither profit nor pleasure--At this remark, our uncle\r\nchanged colour, and looked round the company, conscious that his own\r\nwithers were not altogether unwrung. ‘But, Clinker (said he) if you\r\nshould have eloquence enough to persuade the vulgar to resign those\r\ntropes and figures of rhetoric, there will be little or nothing left to\r\ndistinguish their conversation from that of their betters.’ ‘But then\r\nyour honour knows, their conversation will be void of offence; and, at\r\nthe day of judgment, there will be no distinction of persons.’\r\n\r\nHumphry going down stairs to fetch up a bottle of wine, my uncle\r\ncongratulated his sister upon having such a reformer in the family; when\r\nMrs Tabitha declared, he was a sober civilized fellow; very respectful,\r\nand very industrious; and, she believed, a good Christian into\r\nthe bargain. One would think, Clinker must really have some very\r\nextraordinary talent, to ingratiate himself in this manner with a\r\nvirago of her character, so fortified against him with prejudice and\r\nresentment; but the truth is, since the adventure of Salt-hill, Mrs\r\nTabby seems to be entirely changed. She has left off scolding the\r\nservants, an exercise which was grown habitual, and even seemed\r\nnecessary to her constitution; and is become so indifferent to Chowder,\r\nas to part with him in a present to lady Griskin, who proposes to bring\r\nthe breed of him into fashion. Her ladyship is the widow of Sir Timothy\r\nGriskin, a distant relation of our family. She enjoys a jointure of five\r\nhundred pounds a-year, and makes shift to spend three times that sum.\r\nHer character before marriage was a little equivocal; but at present she\r\nlives in the bon ton, keeps card-tables, gives private suppers to select\r\nfriends, and is visited by persons of the first fashion--She has been\r\nremarkably civil to us all, and cultivates my uncle with the most\r\nparticular regard; but the more she strokes him, the more his bristles\r\nseem to rise--To her compliments he makes very laconic and dry\r\nreturns--T’other day she sent us a pottle of fine strawberries, which\r\nhe did not receive without signs of disgust, muttering from the Aeneid,\r\ntimeo Danaos et Dona ferentes. She has twice called for Liddy, of a\r\nforenoon, to take an airing in the coach; but Mrs Tabby was always so\r\nalert (I suppose by his direction) that she never could have the niece\r\nwithout her aunt’s company. I have endeavoured to sound Square-toes on\r\nthis subject; but he carefully avoids all explanation.\r\n\r\nI have now, dear Phillips, filled a whole sheet, and if you have read it\r\nto an end, I dare say, you are as tired as\r\n\r\nYour humble servant, J. MELFORD LONDON, June 2.\r\n\nTo Dr LEWIS.\r\n\r\nYes, Doctor, I have seen the British Museum; which is a noble\r\ncollection, and even stupendous, if we consider it was made by a private\r\nman, a physician, who was obliged to make his own fortune at the same\r\ntime: but great as the collection is, it would appear more striking if\r\nit was arranged in one spacious saloon, instead of being divided into\r\ndifferent apartments, which it does not entirely fill--I could wish the\r\nseries of medals was connected, and the whole of the animal, vegetable,\r\nand mineral kingdoms completed, by adding to each, at the public\r\nexpence, those articles that are wanting. It would likewise be a great\r\nimprovement, with respect to the library, if the deficiencies were made\r\nup, by purchasing all the books of character that are not to be found\r\nalready in the collection--They might be classed in centuries, according\r\nto the dates of their publication, and catalogues printed of them and\r\nthe manuscripts, for the information of those that want to consult, or\r\ncompile from such authorities. I could also wish, for the honour of the\r\nnation, that there was a complete apparatus for a course of mathematics,\r\nmechanics, and experimental philosophy; and a good salary settled upon\r\nan able professor, who should give regular lectures on these subjects.\r\n\r\nBut this is all idle speculation, which will never be reduced to\r\npractice--Considering the temper of the times, it is a wonder to see any\r\ninstitution whatsoever established for the benefit of the Public. The\r\nspirit of party is risen to a kind of phrenzy, unknown to former ages,\r\nor rather degenerated to a total extinction of honesty and candour--You\r\nknow I have observed, for some time, that the public papers are become\r\nthe infamous vehicles of the most cruel and perfidious defamation: every\r\nrancorous knave every desperate incendiary, that can afford to spend\r\nhalf a crown or three shillings, may skulk behind the press of a\r\nnewsmonger, and have a stab at the first character in the kingdom,\r\nwithout running the least hazard of detection or punishment.\r\n\r\nI have made acquaintance with a Mr Barton, whom Jery knew at Oxford;\r\na good sort of a man, though most ridiculously warped in his political\r\nprinciples; but his partiality is the less offensive, as it never\r\nappears in the stile of scurrility and abuse. He is a member of\r\nparliament, and a retainer to the court; and his whole conversation\r\nturns upon the virtues and perfections of the ministers, who are his\r\npatrons. T’other day, when he was bedaubing one of those worthies,\r\nwith the most fulsome praise, I told him I had seen the same nobleman\r\ncharacterised very differently, in one of the daily-papers; indeed, so\r\nstigmatized, that if one half of what was said of him was true, he\r\nmust be not only unfit to rule, but even unfit to live: that those\r\nimpeachments had been repeated again and again, with the addition\r\nof fresh matter; and that as he had taken no steps towards his own\r\nvindication, I began to think there was some foundation for the charge.\r\n‘And pray, Sir (said Mr Barton), what steps would you have him take?\r\nSuppose he should prosecute the publisher, who screens the anonymous\r\naccuser, and bring him to the pillory for a libel; this is so far from\r\nbeing counted a punishment, in terrorem, that it will probably make his\r\nfortune. The multitude immediately take him into their protection, as a\r\nmartyr to the cause of defamation, which they have always espoused. They\r\npay his fine, they contribute to the increase of his stock, his shop is\r\ncrowded with customers, and the sale of his paper rises in proportion\r\nto the scandal it contains. All this time the prosecutor is inveighed\r\nagainst as a tyrant and oppressor, for having chosen to proceed by\r\nthe way of information, which is deemed a grievance; but if he lays an\r\naction for damages, he must prove the damage, and I leave you to judge,\r\nwhether a gentleman’s character may not be brought into contempt, and\r\nall his views in life blasted by calumny, without his being able to\r\nspecify the particulars of the damage he has sustained.\r\n\r\n‘This spirit of defamation is a kind of heresy, that thrives under\r\npersecution. The liberty of the press is a term of great efficacy; and\r\nlike that of the Protestant religion, has often served the purposes of\r\nsedition--A minister, therefore, must arm himself with patience, and\r\nbear those attacks without repining--Whatever mischief they may do in\r\nother respects, they certainly contribute, in one particular, to the\r\nadvantages of government; for those defamatory articles have multiplied\r\npapers in such a manner, and augmented their sale to such a degree, that\r\nthe duty upon stamps and advertisements has made a very considerable\r\naddition to the revenue.’ Certain it is, a gentleman’s honour is a very\r\ndelicate subject to be handled by a jury, composed of men, who cannot\r\nbe supposed remarkable either for sentiment or impartiality--In such a\r\ncase, indeed, the defendant is tried, not only by his peers, but also\r\nby his party; and I really think, that of all patriots, he is the most\r\nresolute who exposes himself to such detraction, for the sake of his\r\ncountry--If, from the ignorance or partiality of juries, a gentleman can\r\nhave no redress from law, for being defamed in a pamphlet or newspaper,\r\nI know but one other method of proceeding against the publisher, which\r\nis attended with some risque, but has been practised successfully, more\r\nthan once, in my remembrance--A regiment of horse was represented, in\r\none of the newspapers, as having misbehaved at Dettingen; a captain\r\nof that regiment broke the publisher’s bones, telling him, at the same\r\ntime, if he went to law, he should certainly have the like salutation\r\nfrom every officer of the corps. Governor--took the same satisfaction on\r\nthe ribs of an author, who traduced him by name in a periodical paper--I\r\nknow a low fellow of the same class, who, being turned out of Venice for\r\nhis impudence and scurrility, retired to Lugano, a town of the Grisons\r\n(a free people, God wot) where he found a printing press, from whence he\r\nsquirted his filth at some respectable characters in the republic, which\r\nhe had been obliged to abandon. Some of these, finding him out of the\r\nreach of legal chastisement, employed certain useful instruments, such\r\nas may be found in all countries, to give him the bastinado; which,\r\nbeing repeated more than once, effectually stopt the current of his\r\nabuse.\r\n\r\nAs for the liberty of the press, like every other privilege, it must be\r\nrestrained within certain bounds; for if it is carried to a branch of\r\nlaw, religion, and charity, it becomes one of the greatest evils that\r\never annoyed the community. If the lowest ruffian may stab your good\r\nname with impunity in England, will you be so uncandid as to exclaim\r\nagainst Italy for the practice of common assassination? To what purpose\r\nis our property secured, if our moral character is left defenceless?\r\nPeople thus baited, grow desperate; and the despair of being able to\r\npreserve one’s character, untainted by such vermin, produces a total\r\nneglect of fame; so that one of the chief incitements to the practice of\r\nvirtue is effectually destroyed.\r\n\r\nMr Barton’s last consideration, respecting the stamp-duty, is equally\r\nwise and laudable with another maxim which has been long adopted by our\r\nfinanciers, namely, to connive at drunkenness, riot, and dissipation,\r\nbecause they inhance the receipt of the excise; not reflecting, that in\r\nproviding this temporary convenience, they are destroying the morals,\r\nhealth, and industry of the people--Notwithstanding my contempt for\r\nthose who flatter a minister, I think there is something still more\r\ndespicable in flattering a mob. When I see a man of birth, education,\r\nand fortune, put himself on a level with the dregs of the people, mingle\r\nwith low mechanics, feed with them at the same board, and drink with\r\nthem in the same cup, flatter their prejudices, harangue in praise of\r\ntheir virtues, expose themselves to the belchings of their beer, the\r\nfumes of their tobacco, the grossness of their familiarity, and the\r\nimpertinence of their conversation, I cannot help despising him, as\r\na man guilty of the vilest prostitution, in order to effect a purpose\r\nequally selfish and illiberal.\r\n\r\nI should renounce politics the more willingly, if I could find other\r\ntopics of conversation discussed with more modesty and candour; but the\r\ndaemon of party seems to have usurped every department of life. Even\r\nthe world of literature and taste is divided into the most virulent\r\nfactions, which revile, decry, and traduce the works of one another.\r\nYesterday, I went to return an afternoon’s visit to a gentleman of my\r\nacquaintance, at whose house I found one of the authors of the present\r\nage, who has written with some success--As I had read one or two of his\r\nperformances, which gave me pleasure, I was glad of this opportunity\r\nto know his person; but his discourse and deportment destroyed all the\r\nimpressions which his writings had made in his favour. He took upon him\r\nto decide dogmatically upon every subject, without deigning to shew the\r\nleast cause for his differing from the general opinions of mankind,\r\nas if it had been our duty to acquiesce in the ipse dixit of this new\r\nPythagoras. He rejudged the characters of all the principal authors, who\r\nhad died within a century of the present time; and, in this revision,\r\npaid no sort of regard to the reputation they had acquired--Milton was\r\nharsh and prosaic; Dryden, languid and verbose; Butler and Swift\r\nwithout humour; Congreve, without wit; and Pope destitute of any sort of\r\npoetical merit--As for his contemporaries, he could not bear to hear\r\none of them mentioned with any degree of applause--They were all dunces,\r\npedants, plagiaries, quacks, and impostors; and you could not name a\r\nsingle performance, but what was tame, stupid, and insipid. It must be\r\nowned, that this writer had nothing to charge his conscience with, on\r\nthe side of flattery; for I understand, he was never known to praise one\r\nline that was written, even by those with whom he lived on terms of good\r\nfellowship. This arrogance and presumption, in depreciating authors, for\r\nwhose reputation the company may be interested, is such an insult upon\r\nthe understanding, as I could not bear without wincing.\r\n\r\nI desired to know his reasons for decrying some works, which had\r\nafforded me uncommon pleasure; and, as demonstration did not seem to be\r\nhis talent, I dissented from his opinion with great freedom. Having been\r\nspoiled by the deference and humility of his hearers, he did not bear\r\ncontradiction with much temper; and the dispute might have grown warm,\r\nhad it not been interrupted by the entrance of a rival bard, at whose\r\nappearance he always quits the place--They are of different cabals, and\r\nhave been at open war these twenty years--If the other was dogmatical,\r\nthis genius was declamatory: he did not discourse, but harangue; and his\r\norations were equally tedious and turgid. He too pronounces ex cathedra\r\nupon the characters of his contemporaries; and though he scruples not to\r\ndeal out praise, even lavishly, to the lowest reptile in Grubstreet who\r\nwill either flatter him in private, or mount the public rostrum as his\r\npanegyrist, he damns all the other writers of the age, with the utmost\r\ninsolence and rancour--One is a blunderbuss, as being a native of\r\nIreland; another, a half-starved louse of literature, from the banks\r\nof the Tweed; a third, an ass, because he enjoys a pension from the\r\ngovernment; a fourth, the very angel of dulness, because he succeeded in\r\na species of writing in which this Aristarchus had failed; a fifth, who\r\npresumed to make strictures upon one of his performances, he holds as\r\na bug in criticism, whose stench is more offensive than his sting--In\r\nshort, except himself and his myrmidons, there is not a man of genius\r\nor learning in the three kingdoms. As for the success of those, who have\r\nwritten without the pale of this confederacy, he imputes it entirely to\r\nwant of taste in the public; not considering, that to the approbation of\r\nthat very tasteless public, he himself owes all the consequence he has\r\nin life.\r\n\r\nThose originals are not fit for conversation. If they would maintain the\r\nadvantage they have gained by their writing, they should never appear\r\nbut upon paper--For my part, I am shocked to find a man have sublime\r\nideas in his head, and nothing but illiberal sentiments in his\r\nheart--The human soul will be generally found most defective in the\r\narticle of candour--I am inclined to think, no mind was ever wholly\r\nexempt from envy; which, perhaps, may have been implanted, as an\r\ninstinct essential to our nature. I am afraid we sometimes palliate\r\nthis vice, under the spacious name of emulation. I have known a person\r\nremarkably generous, humane, moderate, and apparently self-denying,\r\nwho could not hear even a friend commended, without betraying marks of\r\nuneasiness; as if that commendation had implied an odious comparison\r\nto his prejudice, and every wreath of praise added to the other’s\r\ncharacter, was a garland plucked from his own temples. This is a\r\nmalignant species of jealousy, of which I stand acquitted in my own\r\nconscience.\r\n\r\nWhether it is a vice, or an infirmity, I leave you to inquire.\r\n\r\nThere is another point, which I would much rather see determined;\r\nwhether the world was always as contemptible, as it appears to me at\r\npresent?--If the morals of mankind have not contracted an extraordinary\r\ndegree of depravity, within these thirty years, then must I be infected\r\nwith the common vice of old men, difficilis, querulus, laudator temporis\r\nacti; or, which is more probable, the impetuous pursuits and avocations\r\nof youth have formerly hindered me from observing those rotten parts of\r\nhuman nature, which now appear so offensively to my observation.\r\n\r\nWe have been at court, and ‘change, and every where; and every where we\r\nfind food for spleen, and subject for ridicule--My new servant,\r\nHumphry Clinker, turns out a great original: and Tabby is a changed\r\ncreature--She has parted with Chowder; and does nothing but smile, like\r\nMalvolio in the play--I’ll be hanged if she is not acting a part which\r\nis not natural to her disposition, for some purpose which I have not yet\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the characters of mankind, my curiosity is quite\r\nsatisfied: I have done with the science of men, and must now endeavour\r\nto amuse myself with the novelty of things. I am, at present, by a\r\nviolent effort of the mind, forced from my natural bias; but this power\r\nceasing to act, I shall return to my solitude with redoubled velocity.\r\nEvery thing I see, and hear, and feel, in this great reservoir of folly,\r\nknavery, and sophistication, contributes to inhance the value of a\r\ncountry life, in the sentiments of\r\n\r\nYours always, MATT. BRAMBLE LONDON, June 2.\r\n\nTo Mrs MARY JONES, at Brambleton-hall.\r\n\r\nDEAR MARY JONES,\r\n\r\nLady Griskin’s botler, Mr Crumb, having got ‘squire Barton to frank me\r\na kiver, I would not neglect to let you know how it is with me, and the\r\nrest of the family.\r\n\r\nI could not rite by John Thomas, for because he went away in a huff,\r\nat a minutes’ warning. He and Chowder could not agree, and so they fitt\r\nupon the road, and Chowder bitt his thumb, and he swore he would do him\r\na mischief, and he spoke saucy to mistress, whereby the squire turned\r\nhim off in gudgeon; and by God’s providence we picked up another\r\nfootman, called Umphry Klinker; a good sole as ever broke bread;\r\nwhich shews that a scalded cat may prove a good mouser, and a hound be\r\nstaunch, thof he has got narro hare on his buttocks; but the proudest\r\nnose may be bro’t to the grinestone, by sickness and misfortunes.\r\n\r\n0 Molly! what shall I say of London? All the towns that ever I beheld\r\nin my born-days, are no more than Welsh barrows and crumlecks to this\r\nwonderful sitty! Even Bath itself is but a fillitch, in the naam of\r\nGod--One would think there’s no end of the streets, but the land’s end.\r\nThen there’s such a power of people, going hurry skurry! Such a racket\r\nof coxes! Such a noise, and haliballoo! So many strange sites to be\r\nseen! O gracious! my poor Welsh brain has been spinning like a top ever\r\nsince I came hither! And I have seen the Park, and the paleass of Saint\r\nGimses, and the king’s and the queen’s magisterial pursing, and the\r\nsweet young princes, and the hillyfents, and pye bald ass, and all the\r\nrest of the royal family.\r\n\r\nLast week I went with mistress to the Tower, to see the crowns and wild\r\nbeastis; and there was a monstracious lion, with teeth half a quarter\r\nlong; and a gentleman bid me not go near him, if I wasn’t a maid; being\r\nas how he would roar, and tear, and play the dickens--Now I had no mind\r\nto go near him; for I cannot abide such dangerous honeymils, not I--but,\r\nmistress would go; and the beast kept such a roaring and bouncing,\r\nthat I tho’t he would have broke his cage and devoured us all; and the\r\ngentleman tittered forsooth; but I’ll go to death upon it, I will,\r\nthat my lady is as good a firchin, as the child unborn; and, therefore,\r\neither the gentleman told a fib, or the lion oft to be set in the\r\nstocks for bearing false witness agin his neighbour; for the commandment\r\nsayeth, Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.\r\n\r\nI was afterwards of a party at Sadler’s-wells, where I saw such tumbling\r\nand dancing upon ropes and wires, that I was frightened and ready to\r\ngo into a fit--I tho’t it was all inchantment; and, believing myself\r\nbewitched, began for to cry--You knows as how the witches in Wales fly\r\nupon broom-sticks: but here was flying without any broom-stick, or thing\r\nin the varsal world, and firing of pistols in the air, and blowing of\r\ntrumpets, and swinging, and rolling of wheel-barrows upon a wire (God\r\nbless us!) no thicker than a sewing-thread; that, to be sure, they must\r\ndeal with the devil!--A fine gentleman, with a pig’s-tail, and a golden\r\nsord by his side, come to comfit me, and offered for to treat me with\r\na pint of wind; but I would not stay; and so, in going through the dark\r\npassage, he began to shew his cloven futt, and went for to be rude: my\r\nfellow-sarvant, Umphry Klinker, bid him be sivil, and he gave the young\r\nman a dowse in the chops; but, I fackins, Mr Klinker wa’n’t long in\r\nhis debt--with a good oaken sapling he dusted his doublet, for all his\r\ngolden cheese toaster; and, fipping me under his arm, carried me huom, I\r\nnose not how, being I was in such a flustration--But, thank God! I’m\r\nnow vaned from all such vanities; for what are all those rarities and\r\nvagaries to the glory that shall be revealed hereafter? O Molly! let not\r\nyour poor heart be puffed up with vanity.\r\n\r\nI had almost forgot to tell you, that I have had my hair cut and\r\npippered, and singed, and bolstered, and buckled, in the newest fashion,\r\nby a French freezer--Parley vow Francey--Vee madmansell--I now carries\r\nmy head higher than arrow private gentlewoman of Vales. Last night,\r\ncoming huom from the meeting, I was taken by lamp-light for an iminent\r\npoulterer’s daughter, a great beauty--But as I was saying, this is all\r\nvanity and vexation of spirit--The pleasures of London are no better\r\nthan sower whey and stale cyder, when compared to the joys of the new\r\nGerusalem.\r\n\r\nDear Mary Jones! An please God when I return, I’ll bring you a new cap,\r\nwith a turkey-shell coom, and a pyehouse sermon, that was preached in\r\nthe Tabernacle; and I pray of all love, you will mind your vriting\r\nand your spilling; for, craving your pardon, Molly, it made me suet\r\nto disseyffer your last scrabble, which was delivered by the hind at\r\nBath--0, voman! voman! if thou had’st but the least consumption of what\r\npleasure we scullers have, when we can cunster the crabbidst buck off\r\nhand, and spell the ethnitch vords without lucking at the primmer. As\r\nfor Mr Klinker, he is qualified to be a clerk to a parish--But I’ll say\r\nno more--Remember me to Saul--poor sole! it goes to my hart to think\r\nshe don’t yet know her letters--But all in God’s good time--It shall go\r\nhard, but I will bring her the A B C in gingerbread; and that, you nose,\r\nwill be learning to her taste.\r\n\r\nMistress says, we are going a long gurney to the North; but go where we\r\nwill, I shall ever be,\r\n\r\nDear Mary Jones, Yours with true infection WIN. JENKINS LONDON, June 3.\r\n\nTo Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of Jesus college, Oxon.\r\n\r\nDEAR WAT,\r\n\r\nI mentioned in my last, my uncle’s design of going to the duke of N--‘s\r\nlevee; which design has been executed accordingly. His grace has been\r\nso long accustomed to this kind of homage, that though the place he now\r\nfills does not imply the tenth part of the influence, which he exerted\r\nin his former office, he has given his friends to understand, that they\r\ncannot oblige him in any thing more, than in contributing to support\r\nthe shadow of that power, which he no longer retains in substance; and\r\ntherefore he has still public days, on which they appear at his levee.\r\n\r\nMy uncle and I went thither with Mr Barton, who, being one of the duke’s\r\nadherents, undertook to be our introducer--The room was pretty well\r\nfilled with people, in a great variety of dress; but there was no more\r\nthan one gown and cassock, though I was told his grace had, while he was\r\nminister, preferred almost every individual that now filled the bench of\r\nbishops in the house of lords; but in all probability, the gratitude of\r\nthe clergy is like their charity, which shuns the light--Mr Barton\r\nwas immediately accosted by a person well stricken in years, tall, and\r\nraw-boned, with a hook-nose, and an arch leer, that indicated, at least,\r\nas much cunning as sagacity. Our conductor saluted him, by the name of\r\ncaptain C--, and afterwards informed us he was a man of shrewd parts,\r\nwhom the government occasionally employed in secret services. But I have\r\nhad the history of him more at large, from another quarter. He had been,\r\nmany years ago, concerned in fraudulent practices, as a merchant, in\r\nFrance; and being convicted of some of them, was sent to the gallies,\r\nfrom whence he was delivered by the interest of the late duke of Ormond,\r\nto whom he had recommended himself in letter, as his name-sake and\r\nrelation--He was in the sequel, employed by our ministry as a spy;\r\nand in the war of 1740, traversed all Spain, as well as France, in the\r\ndisguise of a capuchin, at the extreme hazard of his life, in as much as\r\nthe court of Madrid had actually got scent of him, and given orders to\r\napprehend him at St Sebastian’s, from whence he had fortunately retired\r\nbut a few hours before the order arrived. This and other hair-breadth\r\n‘scapes he pleaded so effectually as a merit with the English ministry,\r\nthat they allowed him a comfortable pension, which he now enjoys in his\r\nold age--He has still access to all the ministers, and is said to be\r\nconsulted by them on many subjects, as a man of uncommon understanding\r\nand great experience--He is, in fact, a fellow of some parts, and\r\ninvincible assurance; and, in his discourse, he assumes such an air\r\nof self-sufficiency, as may very well impose upon some of the shallow\r\npoliticians, who now labour at the helm of administration. But, if he is\r\nnot belied, this is not the only imposture of which he is guilty--They\r\nsay, he is at bottom not only a Roman-catholic, but really a priest; and\r\nwhile he pretends to disclose to our state-pilots all the springs that\r\nmove the cabinet of Versailles, he is actually picking up intelligence\r\nfor the service of the French minister. Be that as it may, captain\r\nC-- entered into conversation with us in the most familiar manner, and\r\ntreated the duke’s character without any ceremony--‘This wiseacre (said\r\nhe) is still a-bed; and, I think, the best thing he can do, is to sleep\r\non till Christmas; for, when he gets up, he does nothing but expose his\r\nown folly.--Since Grenville was turned out, there has been no minister\r\nin this nation worth the meal that whitened his peri-wig--They are so\r\nignorant, they scarce know a crab from a cauliflower; and then they\r\nare such dunces, that there’s no making them comprehend the plainest\r\nproposition--In the beginning of the war, this poor half-witted creature\r\ntold me, in a great fright, that thirty thousand French had marched\r\nfrom Acadie to Cape Breton--“Where did they find transports? (said I)”\r\n “Transports (cried he) I tell you they marched by land”--“By land to the\r\nisland of Cape Breton?” “What! is Cape Breton an island?” “Certainly.”\r\n “Ha! are you sure of that?” When I pointed it out in the map, he\r\nexamined it earnestly with his spectacles; then, taking me in his arms,\r\n“My dear C--! (cried he) you always bring us good news--Egad! I’ll go\r\ndirectly, and tell the king that Cape Breton is an island.”’\r\n\r\nHe seemed disposed to entertain us with more anecdotes of this nature,\r\nat the expense of his grace, when he was interrupted by the arrival\r\nof the Algerine ambassador; a venerable Turk, with a long white beard,\r\nattended by his dragoman, or interpreter, and another officer of his\r\nhousehold, who had got no stockings to his legs--Captain C-- immediately\r\nspoke with an air of authority to a servant in waiting, bidding him go\r\nand tell the duke to rise, as there was a great deal of company come,\r\nand, among others, the ambassador from Algiers. Then, turning to\r\nus, ‘This poor Turk (said he) notwithstanding his grey beard, is a\r\ngreen-horn--He has been several years resident in London, and still is\r\nignorant of our political revolutions. This visit is intended for\r\nthe prime minister of England; but you’ll see how this wise duke will\r\nreceive it as a mark of attachment to his own person’--Certain it is,\r\nthe duke seemed eager to acknowledge the compliment--A door opened,\r\nhe suddenly bolted out; with a shaving-cloth under his chin, his\r\nface frothed up to the eyes with soap lather; and running up to the\r\nambassador, grinned hideous in his face--‘My dear Mahomet! (said he) God\r\nlove your long beard, I hope the dey will make you a horsetail at the\r\nnext promotion, ha, ha, ha! Have but a moment’s patience, and I’ll send\r\nto you in a twinkling,’--So saying, he retired into his den, leaving\r\nthe Turk in some confusion. After a short pause, however, he said\r\nsomething to his interpreter, the meaning of which I had great\r\ncuriosity to know, as he turned up his eyes while he spoke, expressing\r\nastonishment, mixed with devotion. We were gratified by means of the\r\ncommunicative captain C--, who conversed with the dragoman, as an old\r\nacquaintance. Ibrahim, the ambassador, who had mistaken his grace for\r\nthe minister’s fool, was no sooner undeceived by the interpreter, than\r\nhe exclaimed to this effect ‘Holy prophet! I don’t wonder that this\r\nnation prospers, seeing it is governed by the counsel of ideots; a\r\nseries of men, whom all good mussulmen revere as the organs of immediate\r\ninspiration!’ Ibrahim was favoured with a particular audience of short\r\nduration; after which the duke conducted him to the door, and\r\nthen returned to diffuse his gracious looks among the crowd of his\r\nworshippers.\r\n\r\nAs Mr Barton advanced to present me to his grace, it was my fortune to\r\nattract his notice, before I was announced--He forthwith met me more\r\nthan half way, and, seizing me by the hand, ‘My dear Sir Francis! (cried\r\nhe) this is so kind--I vow to God! I am so obliged--Such attention to\r\na poor broken minister. Well--Pray when does your excellency set\r\nsail?--For God’s sake have a care of your health, and eat stewed\r\nprunes in the passage. Next to your own precious health, pray, my dear\r\nexcellency, take care of the Five Nations--Our good friends the Five\r\nNations. The Toryrories, the Maccolmacks, the Out-o’the-ways, the\r\nCrickets, and the Kickshaws--Let ‘em have plenty of blankets, and\r\nstinkubus, and wampum; and your excellency won’t fail to scour\r\nthe kettle, and boil the chain, and bury the tree, and plant the\r\nhatchet--Ha, ha, ha!’ When he had uttered this rhapsody, with his usual\r\nprecipitation, Mr Barton gave him to understand, that I was neither Sir\r\nFrancis, nor St Francis, but simply Mr Melford, nephew to Mr Bramble;\r\nwho, stepping forward, made his bow at the same time. ‘Odso! no more it\r\nis Sir Francis--(said this wise statesman) Mr Melford, I’m glad to\r\nsee you--I sent you an engineer to fortify your dock--Mr Bramble--your\r\nservant, Mr Bramble--How d’ye, good Mr Bramble? Your nephew is a pretty\r\nyoung fellow--Faith and troth, a very pretty fellow!--His father is\r\nmy old friend--How does he hold it? Still troubled with that damned\r\ndisorder, ha?’ ‘No, my lord (replied my uncle), all his troubles are\r\nover--He has been dead these fifteen years.’ ‘Dead! how--Yes faith!\r\nnow I remember: he is dead sure enough--Well, and how--does the\r\nyoung gentleman stand for Haverford West? or--a what d’ye. My dear Mr\r\nMilfordhaven, I’ll do you all the service in my power I hope I have some\r\ncredit left’--My uncle then gave him to understand, that I was still a\r\nminor; and that we had no intention to trouble him at present, for any\r\nfavour whatsoever--‘I came hither with my nephew (added he) to pay our\r\nrespects to your grace; and I may venture to say, that his views and\r\nmine are at least as disinterested as those of any individual in this\r\nassembly.’ ‘My dear Mr Brambleberry! you do me infinite honour--I shall\r\nalways rejoice to see you and your hopeful nephew, Mr Milfordhaven--My\r\ncredit, such as it is, you may command--I wish we had more friends of\r\nyour kidney.’\r\n\r\nThen, turning to captain C--, ‘Ha, C--! (said he) what news, C--? How\r\ndoes the world wag? ha!’ ‘The world wags much after the old fashion, my\r\nlord (answered the captain): the politicians of London and Westminster\r\nhave begun again to wag their tongues against your grace; and your\r\nshort-lived popularity wags like a feather, which the next puff of\r\nantiministerial calumny will blow away’--‘A pack of rascals (cried the\r\nduke)--Tories, Jacobites, rebels; one half of them would wag their heels\r\nat Tyburn, if they had their deserts’--So saying, he wheeled about;\r\nand going round the levee, spoke to every individual, with the most\r\ncourteous familiarity; but he scarce ever opened his mouth without\r\nmaking some blunder, in relation to the person or business of the party\r\nwith whom he conversed; so that he really looked like a comedian, hired\r\nto burlesque the character of a minister--At length, a person of a very\r\nprepossessing appearance coming in, his grace ran up, and, hugging him\r\nin his arms, with the appellation of ‘My dear Ch--s!’ led him forthwith\r\ninto the inner apartment, or Sanctum Sanctorum of this political temple.\r\n‘That (said captain C--) is my friend C-- T--, almost the only man of\r\nparts who has any concern in the present administration--Indeed, he\r\nwould have no concern at all in the matter, if the ministry did not find\r\nit absolutely necessary to make use of his talents upon some particular\r\noccasions--As for the common business of the nation, it is carried on in\r\na constant routine by the clerks of the different offices, otherwise the\r\nwheels of government would be wholly stopt amidst the abrupt succession\r\nof ministers, every one more ignorant than his predecessor--I am\r\nthinking what a fine hovel we should be in, if all the clerks of the\r\ntreasury, the secretaries, of the war-office, and the admiralty, should\r\ntake it in their heads to throw up their places in imitation of the\r\ngreat pensioner--But, to return to C-- T--; he certainly knows more\r\nthan all the ministry and all the opposition, if their heads were laid\r\ntogether, and talks like an angel on a vast variety of subjects. He\r\nwould really be a great man, if he had any consistency or stability of\r\ncharacter--Then, it must be owned, he wants courage, otherwise he would\r\nnever allow himself to be cowed by the great political bully, for whose\r\nunderstanding he has justly a very great contempt. I have seen him as\r\nmuch afraid of that overbearing Hector, as ever schoolboy was of his\r\npedagogue; and yet this Hector, I shrewdly suspect, is no more than a\r\ncraven at bottom--Besides this defect, C-- has another, which he is\r\nat too little pains to hide--There’s no faith to be given to his\r\nassertions, and no trust to be put in his promises--However, to give\r\nthe devil his due, he’s very good-natured; and even friendly, when close\r\nurged in the way of solicitation--As for principle, that’s out of the\r\nquestion--In a word, he is a wit and an orator, extremely entertaining,\r\nand he shines very often at the expence even of those ministers to whom\r\nhe is a retainer. This is a mark of great imprudence, by which he has\r\nmade them all his enemies, whatever face they may put upon the matter;\r\nand sooner or later he’ll have cause to wish he had been able to keep\r\nhis own counsel. I have several times cautioned him on this subject;\r\nbut ‘tis all preaching to the desert--His vanity runs away with his\r\ndiscretion’--I could not help thinking the captain himself might have\r\nbeen the better for some hints of the same nature--His panegyric,\r\nexcluding principle and veracity, puts me in mind of a contest I\r\nonce overheard, in the way of altercation, betwixt two apple-women\r\nin Spring-garden--One of those viragos having hinted something to the\r\nprejudice of the other’s moral character, her antagonist, setting her\r\nhands in her sides, replied--‘Speak out, hussy--I scorn your malice--I\r\nown I’m both a whore and a thief; and what more have you to say?--Damn\r\nyou, what more have you to say? baiting that, which all the world knows,\r\nI challenge you to say black is the white of my eye’--We did not wait\r\nfor Mr T--‘s coming forth; but after captain C-- had characterised all\r\nthe originals in waiting, we adjourned to a coffeehouse, where we had\r\nbuttered muffins and tea to breakfast, the said captain still favouring\r\nus with his company--Nay, my uncle was so diverted with his anecdotes,\r\nthat he asked him to dinner, and treated him with a fine turbot, to\r\nwhich he did ample justice--That same evening I spent at the tavern with\r\nsome friends, one of whom let me into C--‘s character, which Mr Bramble\r\nno sooner understood, than he expressed some concern for the connexion\r\nhe had made, and resolved to disengage himself from it without ceremony.\r\n\r\nWe are become members of the Society for the Encouragement of the Arts,\r\nand have assisted at some of their deliberations, which were conducted\r\nwith equal spirit and sagacity--My uncle is extremely fond of the\r\ninstitution, which will certainly be productive of great advantages to\r\nthe public, if, from its democratical form, it does not degenerate into\r\ncabal and corruption--You are already acquainted with his aversion to\r\nthe influence of the multitude, which, he affirms, is incompatible with\r\nexcellence, and subversive of order--Indeed his detestation of the mob\r\nhas been heightened by fear, ever since he fainted in the room at Bath;\r\nand this apprehension has prevented him from going to the Little Theatre\r\nin the Hay-market, and other places of entertainment, to which, however,\r\nI have had the honour to attend the ladies.\r\n\r\nIt grates old Square-toes to reflect, that it is not in his power to\r\nenjoy even the most elegant diversions of the capital, without the\r\nparticipation of the vulgar; for they now thrust themselves into all\r\nassemblies, from a ridotto at St James’s, to a hop at Rotherhithe. I\r\nhave lately seen our old acquaintance Dick Ivy, who we imagined had died\r\nof dram-drinking; but he is lately emerged from the Fleet, by means of\r\na pamphlet which he wrote and published against the government with some\r\nsuccess. The sale of this performance enabled him to appear in clean\r\nlinen, and he is now going about soliciting subscriptions for his Poems;\r\nbut his breeches are not yet in the most decent order.\r\n\r\nDick certainly deserves some countenance for his intrepidity and\r\nperseverance--It is not in the power of disappointment, nor even of\r\ndamnation, to drive him to despair--After some unsuccessful essays in\r\nthe way of poetry, he commenced brandy-merchant, and I believe his\r\nwhole stock ran out through his own bowels; then he consorted with a\r\nmilk-woman, who kept a cellar in Petty France: but he could not make his\r\nquarters good; he was dislodged and driven up stairs into the kennel by\r\na corporal in the second regiment of foot-guards--He was afterwards the\r\nlaureat of Blackfriars, from whence there was a natural transition to\r\nthe Fleet--As he had formerly miscarried in panegyric, he now turned his\r\nthoughts to satire, and really seems to have some talent for abuse. If\r\nhe can hold out till the meeting of the parliament, and be prepared\r\nfor another charge, in all probability Dick will mount the pillory,\r\nor obtain a pension, in either of which events his fortune will be\r\nmade--Mean while he has acquired some degree of consideration with the\r\nrespectable writers of the age; and as I have subscribed for his works,\r\nhe did me the favour t’other night to introduce me to a society of those\r\ngeniuses; but I found them exceedingly formal and reserved--They\r\nseemed afraid and jealous of one another, and sat in a state of mutual\r\nrepulsion, like so many particles of vapour, each surrounded by its own\r\nelectrified atmosphere. Dick, who has more vivacity than judgment, tried\r\nmore than once to enliven the conversation; sometimes making an effort\r\nat wit, sometimes letting off a pun, and sometimes discharging a\r\nconundrum; nay, at length he started a dispute upon the hackneyed\r\ncomparison betwixt blank verse and rhyme, and the professors opened with\r\ngreat clamour; but, instead of keeping to the subject, they launched\r\nout into tedious dissertations on the poetry of the ancients; and one\r\nof them, who had been a school-master, displayed his whole knowledge of\r\nprosody, gleaned from Disputer and Ruddiman. At last, I ventured to say,\r\nI did not see how the subject in question could be at all elucidated by\r\nthe practice of the ancients, who certainly had neither blank verse\r\nnor rhyme in their poems, which were measured by feet, whereas ours are\r\nreckoned by the number of syllables--This remark seemed to give umbrage\r\nto the pedant, who forthwith involved himself in a cloud of Greek and\r\nLatin quotations, which nobody attempted to dispel--A confused hum of\r\ninsipid observations and comments ensued; and, upon the whole, I never\r\npassed a duller evening in my life--Yet, without all doubt, some of them\r\nwere men of learning, wit, and ingenuity. As they are afraid of making\r\nfree with one another, they should bring each his butt, or whet-stone,\r\nalong with him, for the entertainment of the company--My uncle says, he\r\nnever desires to meet with more than one wit at a time--One wit, like a\r\nknuckle of ham in soup, gives a zest and flavour to the dish; but more\r\nthan one serves only to spoil the pottage--And now I’m afraid I have\r\ngiven you an unconscionable mess, without any flavour at all; for which,\r\nI suppose, you will bestow your benedictions upon\r\n\r\nYour friend, and servant J. MELFORD LONDON, June 5\r\n\nTo Dr LEWIS.\r\n\r\nDEAR LEWIS\r\n\r\nYour fable of the monkey and the pig, is what the Italians call ben\r\ntrovata: but I shall not repeat it to my apothecary, who is a proud\r\nScotchman, very thin skinned, and, for aught I know, may have his degree\r\nin his pocket--A right Scotchman has always two strings to his bow, and\r\nis in utrumque paratus--Certain it is, I have not ‘scaped a scouring;\r\nbut, I believe, by means of that scouring, I have ‘scaped something\r\nworse, perhaps a tedious fit of the gout or rheumatism; for my appetite\r\nbegan to flag, and I had certain croakings in the bowels, which boded me\r\nno good--Nay, I am not yet quite free of these remembrances, which warn\r\nme to be gone from this centre of infection--\r\n\r\nWhat temptation can a man of my turn and temperament have, to live in\r\na place where every corner teems with fresh objects of detestation\r\nand disgust? What kind of taste and organs must those people have,\r\nwho really prefer the adulterate enjoyments of the town to the genuine\r\npleasures of a country retreat? Most people, I know, are originally\r\nseduced by vanity, ambition, and childish curiosity; which cannot be\r\ngratified, but in the busy haunts of men: but, in the course of this\r\ngratification, their very organs of sense are perverted, and they become\r\nhabitually lost to every relish of what is genuine and excellent in its\r\nown nature.\r\n\r\nShall I state the difference between my town grievances, and my country\r\ncomforts? At Brambleton-hall, I have elbow-room within doors, and\r\nbreathe a clear, elastic, salutary air--I enjoy refreshing sleep, which\r\nis never disturbed by horrid noise, nor interrupted, but in a-morning,\r\nby the sweet twitter of the martlet at my window--I drink the virgin\r\nlymph, pure and chrystalline as it gushes from the rock, or the\r\nsparkling beveridge, home-brewed from malt of my own making; or I\r\nindulge with cyder, which my own orchard affords; or with claret of\r\nthe best growth, imported for my own use, by a correspondent on whose\r\nintegrity I can depend; my bread is sweet and nourishing, made from my\r\nown wheat, ground in my own mill, and baked in my own oven; my table\r\nis, in a great measure, furnished from my own ground; my five-year old\r\nmutton, fed on the fragrant herbage of the mountains, that might vie\r\nwith venison in juice and flavour; my delicious veal, fattened with\r\nnothing but the mother’s milk, that fills the dish with gravy; my\r\npoultry from the barn-door, that never knew confinement, but when they\r\nwere at roost; my rabbits panting from the warren; my game fresh from\r\nthe moors; my trout and salmon struggling from the stream; oysters from\r\ntheir native banks; and herrings, with other sea fish, I can eat in\r\nfour hours after they are taken--My sallads, roots, and potherbs, my own\r\ngarden yields in plenty and perfection; the produce of the natural\r\nsoil, prepared by moderate cultivation. The same soil affords all the\r\ndifferent fruits which England may call her own, so that my dessert is\r\nevery day fresh-gathered from the tree; my dairy flows with nectarious\r\ntildes of milk and cream, from whence we derive abundance of excellent\r\nbutter, curds, and cheese; and the refuse fattens my pigs, that are\r\ndestined for hams and bacon--I go to bed betimes, and rise with the\r\nsun--I make shift to pass the hours without weariness or regret, and\r\nam not destitute of amusements within doors, when the weather will not\r\npermit me to go abroad--I read, and chat, and play at billiards, cards\r\nor back-gammon--Without doors, I superintend my farm, and execute\r\nplans of improvements, the effects of which I enjoy with unspeakable\r\ndelight--Nor do I take less pleasure in seeing my tenants thrive under\r\nmy auspices, and the poor live comfortably by the employment which I\r\nprovide--You know I have one or two sensible friends, to whom I can open\r\nall my heart; a blessing which, perhaps, I might have sought in vain\r\namong the crowded scenes of life: there are a few others of more humble\r\nparts, whom I esteem for their integrity; and their conversation I find\r\ninoffensive, though not very entertaining. Finally, I live in the midst\r\nof honest men, and trusty dependents, who, I flatter myself, have a\r\ndisinterested attachment to my person. You, yourself, my dear Doctor,\r\ncan vouch for the truth of these assertions.\r\n\r\nNow, mark the contrast at London--I am pent up in frowzy lodgings, where\r\nthere is not room enough to swing a cat; and I breathe the steams\r\nof endless putrefaction; and these would, undoubtedly, produce a\r\npestilence, if they were not qualified by the gross acid of sea-coal,\r\nwhich is itself a pernicious nuisance to lungs of any delicacy of\r\ntexture: but even this boasted corrector cannot prevent those languid,\r\nsallow looks, that distinguish the inhabitants of London from those\r\nruddy swains that lead a country-life--I go to bed after midnight, jaded\r\nand restless from the dissipations of the day--I start every hour from\r\nmy sleep, at the horrid noise of the watchmen bawling the hour through\r\nevery street, and thundering at every door; a set of useless fellows,\r\nwho serve no other purpose but that of disturbing the repose of the\r\ninhabitants; and by five o’clock I start out of bed, in consequence\r\nof the still more dreadful alarm made by the country carts, and noisy\r\nrustics bellowing green pease under my window. If I would drink water,\r\nI must quaff the maukish contents of an open aqueduct, exposed to all\r\nmanner of defilement; or swallow that which comes from the river\r\nThames, impregnated with all the filth of London and Westminster--Human\r\nexcrement is the least offensive part of the concrete, which is\r\ncomposed of all the drugs, minerals, and poisons, used in mechanics and\r\nmanufacture, enriched with the putrefying carcasses of beasts and men;\r\nand mixed with the scourings of all the wash-tubs, kennels, and common\r\nsewers, within the bills of mortality.\r\n\r\nThis is the agreeable potation, extolled by the Londoners, as the finest\r\nwater in the universe--As to the intoxicating potion, sold for wine, it\r\nis a vile, unpalatable, and pernicious sophistication, balderdashed with\r\ncyder, corn-spirit, and the juice of sloes. In an action at law, laid\r\nagainst a carman for having staved a cask of port, it appeared from the\r\nevidence of the cooper, that there were not above five gallons of real\r\nwine in the whole pipe, which held above a hundred, and even that had\r\nbeen brewed and adulterated by the merchant at Oporto. The bread I\r\neat in London, is a deleterious paste, mixed up with chalk, alum, and\r\nbone-ashes; insipid to the taste, and destructive to the constitution.\r\nThe good people are not ignorant of this adulteration--but they prefer\r\nit to wholesome bread, because it is whiter than the meal of corn: thus\r\nthey sacrifice their taste and their health, and the lives of their\r\ntender infants, to a most absurd gratification of a mis-judging eye; and\r\nthe miller, or the baker, is obliged to poison them and their families,\r\nin order to live by his profession. The same monstrous depravity appears\r\nin their veal, which is bleached by repeated bleedings, and other\r\nvillainous arts, till there is not a drop of juice left in the body,\r\nand the poor animal is paralytic before it dies; so void of all taste,\r\nnourishment, and savour, that a man might dine as comfortably on a white\r\nfricassee of kid-skin gloves; or chip hats from Leghorn.\r\n\r\nAs they have discharged the natural colour from their bread, their\r\nbutchers-meat, and poultry, their cutlets, ragouts, fricassees and\r\nsauces of all kinds; so they insist upon having the complexion of their\r\npotherbs mended, even at the hazard of their lives. Perhaps, you will\r\nhardly believe they can be so mad as to boil their greens with brass\r\nhalfpence, in order to improve their colour; and yet nothing is more\r\ntrue--Indeed, without this improvement in the colour, they have no\r\npersonal merit. They are produced in an artificial soil, and taste\r\nof nothing but the dunghills, from whence they spring. My cabbage,\r\ncauliflower, and ‘sparagus in the country, are as much superior in\r\nflavour to those that are sold in Covent-garden, as my heath-mutton is\r\nto that of St James’s-market; which in fact, is neither lamb nor mutton,\r\nbut something betwixt the two, gorged in the rank fens of Lincoln and\r\nEssex, pale, coarse, and frowzy--As for the pork, it is an abominable\r\ncarnivorous animal, fed with horse-flesh and distillers’ grains; and\r\nthe poultry is all rotten, in consequence of a fever, occasioned by\r\nthe infamous practice of sewing up the gut, that they may be the sooner\r\nfattened in coops, in consequence of this cruel retention.\r\n\r\nOf the fish, I need say nothing in this hot weather, but that it comes\r\nsixty, seventy, fourscore, and a hundred miles by land-carriage; a\r\ncircumstance sufficient without any comment, to turn a Dutchman’s\r\nstomach, even if his nose was not saluted in every alley with the sweet\r\nflavour of fresh mackarel, selling by retail. This is not the season for\r\noysters; nevertheless, it may not be amiss to mention, that the right\r\nColchester are kept in slime-pits, occasionally overflowed by the sea;\r\nand that the green colour, so much admired by the voluptuaries of this\r\nmetropolis, is occasioned by the vitriolic scum, which rises on the\r\nsurface of the stagnant and stinking water--Our rabbits are bred and\r\nfed in the poulterer’s cellar, where they have neither air nor exercise,\r\nconsequently they must be firm in flesh, and delicious in flavour; and\r\nthere is no game to be had for love or money.\r\n\r\nIt must be owned, the Covent-garden affords some good fruit; which,\r\nhowever, is always engrossed by a few individuals of overgrown fortune,\r\nat an exorbitant price; so that little else than the refuse of the\r\nmarket falls to the share of the community; and that is distributed\r\nby such filthy hands, as I cannot look at without loathing. It was but\r\nyesterday that I saw a dirty barrow-bunter in the street, cleaning her\r\ndusty fruit with her own spittle; and, who knows but some fine lady\r\nof St James’s parish might admit into her delicate mouth those very\r\ncherries, which had been rolled and moistened between the filthy, and,\r\nperhaps, ulcerated chops of a St Giles’s huckster--I need not dwell upon\r\nthe pallid, contaminated mash, which they call strawberries; soiled and\r\ntossed by greasy paws through twenty baskets crusted with dirt; and then\r\npresented with the worst milk, thickened with the worst flour, into a\r\nbad likeness of cream: but the milk itself should not pass unanalysed,\r\nthe produce of faded cabbage-leaves and sour draff, lowered with hot\r\nwater, frothed with bruised snails, carried through the streets in open\r\npails, exposed to foul rinsings, discharged from doors and windows,\r\nspittle, snot, and tobacco-quids from foot passengers, overflowings from\r\nmud carts, spatterings from coach wheels, dirt and trash chucked into it\r\nby roguish boys for the joke’s sake, the spewings of infants, who have\r\nslabbered in the tin-measure, which is thrown back in that condition\r\namong the milk, for the benefit of the next customer; and, finally,\r\nthe vermin that drops from the rags of the nasty drab that vends this\r\nprecious mixture, under the respectable denomination of milk-maid.\r\n\r\nI shall conclude this catalogue of London dainties, with that\r\ntable-beer, guiltless of hops and malt, vapid and nauseous; much fitter\r\nto facilitate the operation of a vomit, than to quench thirst and\r\npromote digestion; the tallowy rancid mass, called butter, manufactured\r\nwith candle grease and kitchen stuff; and their fresh eggs, imported\r\nfrom France and Scotland.--Now, all these enormities might be remedied\r\nwith a very little attention to the article of police, or civil\r\nregulation; but the wise patriots of London have taken it into their\r\nheads, that all regulation is inconsistent with liberty; and that every\r\nman ought to live in his own way, without restraint--Nay, as there is\r\nnot sense enough left among them, to be discomposed by the nuisance I\r\nhave mentioned, they may, for aught I care, wallow in the mire of their\r\nown pollution.\r\n\r\nA companionable man will, undoubtedly put up with many inconveniences\r\nfor the sake of enjoying agreeable society. A facetious friend of mine\r\nused to say, the wine could not be bad, where the company was agreeable;\r\na maxim which, however, ought to be taken cum grano salis: but what\r\nis the society of London, that I should be tempted, for its sake, to\r\nmortify my senses, and compound with such uncleanness as my soul abhors?\r\nAll the people I see, are too much engrossed by schemes of interest or\r\nambition, to have any room left for sentiment or friendship. Even in\r\nsome of my old acquaintance, those schemes and pursuits have obliterated\r\nall traces of our former connexion--Conversation is reduced to party\r\ndisputes, and illiberal altercation--Social commerce, to formal visits\r\nand card-playing--If you pick up a diverting original by accident, it\r\nmay be dangerous to amuse yourself with his oddities--He is generally a\r\ntartar at bottom; a sharper, a spy, or a lunatic. Every person you deal\r\nwith endeavours to overreach you in the way of business; you are preyed\r\nupon by idle mendicants, who beg in the phrase of borrowing, and live\r\nupon the spoils of the stranger--Your tradesmen are without conscience,\r\nyour friends without affection, and your dependents without fidelity.--\r\n\r\nMy letter would swell into a treatise, were I to particularize every\r\ncause of offence that fills up the measure of my aversion to this, and\r\nevery other crowded city--Thank Heaven! I am not so far sucked into\r\nthe vortex, but that I can disengage myself without any great effort of\r\nphilosophy--From this wild uproar of knavery, folly, and impertinence, I\r\nshall fly with double relish to the serenity of retirement, the cordial\r\neffusions of unreserved friendship, the hospitality and protection\r\nof the rural gods; in a word, the jucunda oblivia Vitae, which Horace\r\nhimself had not taste enough to enjoy.--\r\n\r\nI have agreed for a good travelling-coach and four, at a guinea a day,\r\nfor three months certain; and next week we intend to begin our\r\njourney to the North, hoping still to be with you by the latter end of\r\nOctober--I shall continue to write from every stage where we make any\r\nconsiderable halt, as often as anything occurs, which I think can\r\nafford you the least amusement. In the mean time, I must beg you will\r\nsuperintend the oeconomy of Barns, with respect to my hay and corn\r\nharvests; assured that my ground produces nothing but what you may\r\nfreely call your own--On any other terms I should be ashamed to\r\nsubscribe myself\r\n\r\nYour unvariable friend, MATT. BRAMBLE LONDON, June 8.\r\n\nTo Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bart. of Jesus college, Oxon.\r\n\r\nDEAR PHILLIPS,\r\n\r\nIn my last, I mentioned my having spent an evening with a society of\r\nauthors, who seemed to be jealous and afraid of one another. My uncle\r\nwas not at all surprised to hear me say I was disappointed in their\r\nconversation. ‘A man may be very entertaining and instructive upon paper\r\n(said he), and exceedingly dull in common discourse. I have observed,\r\nthat those who shine most in private company, are but secondary stars\r\nin the constellation of genius--A small stock of ideas is more easily\r\nmanaged, and sooner displayed, than a great quantity crowded together.\r\nThere is very seldom any thing extraordinary in the appearance and\r\naddress of a good writer; whereas a dull author generally distinguishes\r\nhimself by some oddity or extravagance. For this reason, I fancy, that\r\nan assembly of Grubs must be very diverting.’\r\n\r\nMy curiosity being excited by this hint, I consulted my friend Dick Ivy,\r\nwho undertook to gratify it the very next day, which was Sunday last.\r\nHe carried me to dine with S--, whom you and I have long known by his\r\nwritings.--He lives in the skirts of the town, and every Sunday his\r\nhouse is opened to all unfortunate brothers of the quill, whom he treats\r\nwith beef, pudding, and potatoes, port, punch, and Calvert’s entire butt\r\nbeer. He has fixed upon the first day of the week for the exercise of\r\nhis hospitality, because some of his guests could not enjoy it on any\r\nother, for reasons that I need not explain. I was civilly received in\r\na plain, yet decent habitation, which opened backwards into a very\r\npleasant garden, kept in excellent order; and, indeed, I saw none of the\r\noutward signs of authorship, either in the house or the landlord, who\r\nis one of those few writers of the age that stand upon their own\r\nfoundation, without patronage, and above dependence. If there was\r\nnothing characteristic in the entertainer, the company made ample amends\r\nfor his want of singularity.\r\n\r\nAt two in the afternoon, I found myself one of ten messmates seated at\r\ntable; and, I question, if the whole kingdom could produce such another\r\nassemblage of originals. Among their peculiarities, I do not mention\r\nthose of dress, which may be purely accidental. What struck me were\r\noddities originally produced by affectation, and afterwards confirmed\r\nby habit. One of them wore spectacles at dinner, and another his hat\r\nflapped; though (as Ivy told me) the first was noted for having a\r\nseaman’s eye, when a bailiff was in the wind; and the other was never\r\nknown to labour under any weakness or defect of vision, except about\r\nfive years ago, when he was complimented with a couple of black eyes by\r\na player, with whom he had quarrelled in his drink. A third wore a laced\r\nstocking, and made use of crutches, because, once in his life, he had\r\nbeen laid up with a broken leg, though no man could leap over a stick\r\nwith more agility. A fourth had contracted such an antipathy to the\r\ncountry, that he insisted upon sitting with his back towards the window\r\nthat looked into the garden, and when a dish of cauliflower was set upon\r\nthe table, he snuffed up volatile salts to keep him from fainting; yet\r\nthis delicate person was the son of a cottager, born under a hedge,\r\nand had many years run wild among asses on a common. A fifth affected\r\ndistraction. When spoke to, he always answered from the purpose\r\nsometimes he suddenly started up, and rapped out a dreadful oath\r\nsometimes he burst out a-laughing--then he folded his arms, and sighed\r\nand then, he hissed like fifty serpents.\r\n\r\nAt first I really thought he was mad, and, as he sat near me, began\r\nto be under some apprehensions for my own safety, when our landlord,\r\nperceiving me alarmed, assured me aloud that I had nothing to fear. ‘The\r\ngentleman (said he) is trying to act a part for which he is by no means\r\nqualified--if he had all the inclination in the world, it is not in his\r\npower to be mad. His spirits are too flat to be kindled into frenzy.’\r\n‘'Tis no bad p-p-puff, however (observed a person in a tarnished\r\nlaced coat): aff-ffected in-madness w-will p-pass for w-wit w-with\r\nnine-ninet-teen out of t-twenty.’--‘And affected stuttering for humour:\r\nreplied our landlord, tho’, God knows, there is an affinity betwixt\r\nthem.’ It seems, this wag, after having made some abortive attempts\r\nin plain speaking, had recourse to this defect, by means of which he\r\nfrequently extorted the laugh of the company, without the least expence\r\nof genius; and that imperfection, which he had at first counterfeited,\r\nwas now become so habitual, that he could not lay it aside.\r\n\r\nA certain winking genius, who wore yellow gloves at dinner, had, on his\r\nfirst introduction, taken such offence at S--, because he looked\r\nand talked, and ate and drank like any other man, that he spoke\r\ncontemptuously of his understanding ever after, and never would repeat\r\nhis visit, until he had exhibited the following proof of his caprice.\r\nWat Wyvil, the poet, having made some unsuccessful advances towards an\r\nintimacy with S--, at last gave him to understand, by a third person,\r\nthat he had written a poem in his praise, and a satire against his\r\nperson; that if he would admit him to his house, the first should be\r\nimmediately sent to press; but that if he persisted in declining his\r\nfriendship, he would publish his satire without delay. S-- replied, that\r\nhe looked upon Wyvil’s panegyrick, as in effect, a species of infamy,\r\nand would resent it accordingly with a good cudgel; but if he published\r\nthe satire, he might deserve his compassion, and had nothing to fear\r\nfrom his revenge. Wyvil having considered the alternative, resolved to\r\nmortify S-- by printing the panegyrick, for which he received a sound\r\ndrubbing. Then he swore the peace against the aggressor, who, in order\r\nto avoid a prosecution at law, admitted him to his good graces. It was\r\nthe singularity in S--‘s conduct, on this occasion, that reconciled him\r\nto the yellow-gloved philosopher, who owned he had some genius, and from\r\nthat period cultivated his acquaintance.\r\n\r\nCurious to know upon what subjects the several talents of my\r\nfellow-guests were employed, I applied to my communicative friend Dick\r\nIvy, who gave me to understand, that most of them were, or had been,\r\nunderstrappers, or journeymen, to more creditable authors, for whom they\r\ntranslated, collated, and compiled, in the business of bookmaking; and\r\nthat all of them had, at different times, laboured in the service of\r\nour landlord, though they had now set up for themselves in various\r\ndepartments of literature. Not only their talents, but also their\r\nnations and dialects were so various, that our conversation resembled\r\nthe confusion of tongues at Babel. We had the Irish brogue, the\r\nScotch accent, and foreign idiom, twanged off by the most discordant\r\nvociferation; for, as they all spoke together, no man had any chance\r\nto be heard, unless he could bawl louder than his fellows. It must be\r\nowned, however, there was nothing pedantic in their discourse; they\r\ncarefully avoided all learned disquisitions, and endeavoured to be\r\nfacetious; nor did their endeavours always miscarry--some droll repartee\r\npassed, and much laughter was excited; and if any individual lost his\r\ntemper so far as to transgress the bounds of decorum, he was effectually\r\nchecked by the master of the feast, who exerted a sort of paternal\r\nauthority over this irritable tribe.\r\n\r\nThe most learned philosopher of the whole collection, who had been\r\nexpelled the university for atheism, has made great progress in a\r\nrefutation of lord Bolingbroke’s metaphysical works, which is said to\r\nbe equally ingenious, and orthodox; but, in the mean time, he has been\r\npresented to the grand jury as a public nuisance, for having blasphemed\r\nin an ale-house on the Lord’s day. The Scotchman gives lectures on the\r\npronunciation of the English language, which he is now publishing by\r\nsubscription.\r\n\r\nThe Irishman is a political writer, and goes by the name of my Lord\r\nPotatoe. He wrote a pamphlet in vindication of a minister, hoping his\r\nzeal would be rewarded with some place or pension; but, finding himself\r\nneglected in that quarter, he whispered about, that the pamphlet was\r\nwritten by the minister himself, and he published an answer to his own\r\nproduction. In this, he addressed the author under the title of your\r\nlordship with such solemnity, that the public swallowed the deceit, and\r\nbought up the whole impression. The wise politicians of the metropolis\r\ndeclared they were both masterly performances, and chuckled over the\r\nflimsy reveries of an ignorant garretteer, as the profound speculations\r\nof a veteran statesman, acquainted with all the secrets of the cabinet.\r\nThe imposture was detected in the sequel, and our Hibernian pamphleteer\r\nretains no part of his assumed importance, but the bare title of\r\nmy lord, and the upper part of the table at the potatoe-ordinary in\r\nShoelane.\r\n\r\nOpposite to me sat a Piedmontese, who had obliged the public with\r\na humorous satire, intituled, The Ballance of the English Poets, a\r\nperformance which evinced the great modesty and taste of the author,\r\nand, in particular, his intimacy with the elegancies of the English\r\nlanguage. The sage, who laboured under the agrophobia, or horror of\r\ngreen fields, had just finished a treatise on practical agriculture,\r\nthough, in fact, he had never seen corn growing in his life, and was\r\nso ignorant of grain, that our entertainer, in the face of the whole\r\ncompany, made him own, that a plate of hominy was the best rice pudding\r\nhe had ever eat.\r\n\r\nThe stutterer had almost finished his travels through Europe and part\r\nof Asia, without ever budging beyond the liberties of the King’s Bench,\r\nexcept in term-time, with a tipstaff for his companion; and as for\r\nlittle Tim Cropdale, the most facetious member of the whole society,\r\nhe had happily wound up the catastrophe of a virgin tragedy, from the\r\nexhibition of which he promised himself a large fund of profit and\r\nreputation. Tim had made shift to live many years by writing novels,\r\nat the rate of five pounds a volume; but that branch of business is now\r\nengrossed by female authors, who publish merely for the propagation of\r\nvirtue, with so much ease and spirit, and delicacy, and knowledge of the\r\nhuman heart, and all in the serene tranquillity of high life, that the\r\nreader is not only inchanted by their genius, but reformed by their\r\nmorality.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, we adjourned into the garden, where, I observed, Mr S--\r\ngave a short separate audience to every individual in a small remote\r\nfilbert walk, from whence most of them dropt off one after another,\r\nwithout further ceremony; but they were replaced by fresh recruits of\r\nthe same clan, who came to make an afternoon’s visit; and, among others,\r\na spruce bookseller, called Birkin, who rode his own gelding, and made\r\nhis appearance in a pair of new jemmy boots, with massy spurs of plate.\r\nIt was not without reason, that this midwife of the Muses used exercise\r\na-horseback, for he was too fat to walk a-foot, and he underwent some\r\nsarcasms from Tim Cropdale, on his unwieldy size and inaptitude for\r\nmotion. Birkin, who took umbrage at this poor author’s petulance in\r\npresuming to joke upon a man so much richer than himself, told him, he\r\nwas not so unwieldy but that he could move the Marshalsea court for a\r\nwrit, and even overtake him with it, if he did not very speedily come\r\nand settle accounts with him, respecting the expence of publishing his\r\nlast ode to the king of Prussia, of which he had sold but three, and\r\none of them was to Whitfield the methodist. Tim affected to receive this\r\nintimation with good humour, saying, he expected in a post or two, from\r\nPotsdam, a poem of thanks from his Prussian majesty, who knew very well\r\nhow to pay poets in their own coin; but, in the mean time, he proposed,\r\nthat Mr Birkin and he should run three times round the garden for a bowl\r\nof punch, to be drank at Ashley’s in the evening, and he would run boots\r\nagainst stockings. The bookseller, who valued himself upon his mettle,\r\nwas persuaded to accept the challenge, and he forthwith resigned\r\nhis boots to Cropdale, who, when he had put them on, was no bad\r\nrepresentation of captain Pistol in the play.\r\n\r\nEvery thing being adjusted, they started together with great\r\nimpetuosity, and, in the second round, Birkin had clearly the advantage,\r\nlarding the lean earth as he puff’d along. Cropdale had no mind to\r\ncontest the victory further; but, in a twinkling, disappeared through\r\nthe back-door of the garden, which opened into a private lane, that had\r\ncommunication with the high road.--The spectators immediately began to\r\nhollow, ‘Stole away!’ and Birkin set off in pursuit of him with great\r\neagerness; but he had not advanced twenty yards in the lane, when a\r\nthorn running into his foot, sent him hopping back into the garden,\r\nroaring with pain, and swearing with vexation. When he was delivered\r\nfrom this annoyance by the Scotchman, who had been bred to surgery, he\r\nlooked about him wildly, exclaiming, ‘Sure, the fellow won’t be such\r\na rogue as to run clear away with my boots!’ Our landlord, having\r\nreconnoitered the shoes he had left, which, indeed, hardly deserved that\r\nname, ‘Pray (said he), Mr Birkin, wa’n’t your boots made of calf-skin?’\r\n‘Calf-skin or cow-skin (replied the other) I’ll find a slip of\r\nsheep-skin that will do his business--I lost twenty pounds by his farce\r\nwhich you persuaded me to buy--I am out of pocket five pounds by\r\nhis damn’d ode; and now this pair of boots, bran new, cost me\r\nthirty shillings, as per receipt--But this affair of the boots is\r\nfelony--transportation.--I’ll have the dog indicted at the Old Bailey--I\r\nwill, Mr S-- I will be reveng’d, even though I should lose my debt in\r\nconsequence of his conviction.’\r\n\r\nMr S-- said nothing at present, but accommodated him with a pair of\r\nshoes; then ordered his servant to rub him down, and comfort him with a\r\nglass of rum-punch, which seemed, in a great measure, to cool the rage\r\nof his indignation. ‘After all (said our landlord) this is no more\r\nthan a humbug in the way of wit, though it deserves a more respectable\r\nepithet, when considered as an effort of invention. Tim, being (I\r\nsuppose) out of credit with the cordwainer, fell upon this ingenious\r\nexpedient to supply the want of shoes, knowing that Mr Birkin, who\r\nloves humour, would himself relish the joke upon a little recollection.\r\nCropdale literally lives by his wit, which he has exercised upon all his\r\nfriends in their turns. He once borrowed my poney for five or six days\r\nto go to Salisbury, and sold him in Smithfield at his return. This was\r\na joke of such a serious nature, that, in the first transports of my\r\npassion, I had some thoughts of prosecuting him for horse-stealing;\r\nand even when my resentment had in some measure subsided, as he\r\nindustriously avoided me, I vowed, I would take satisfaction on his ribs\r\nwith the first opportunity. One day, seeing him at some distance in the\r\nstreet, coming towards me, I began to prepare my cane for action, and\r\nwalked in the shadow of a porter, that he might not perceive me soon\r\nenough to make his escape; but, in the very instant I had lifted up\r\nthe instrument of correction, I found Tim Cropdale metamorphosed into a\r\nmiserable blind wretch, feeling his way with a long stick from post to\r\npost, and rolling about two bald unlighted orbs instead of eyes. I\r\nwas exceedingly shocked at having so narrowly escaped the concern and\r\ndisgrace that would have attended such a misapplication of vengeance:\r\nbut, next day, Tim prevailed upon a friend of mine to come and solicit\r\nmy forgiveness, and offer his note, payable in six weeks, for the price\r\nof the poney. This gentleman gave me to understand, that the blind man\r\nwas no other than Cropdale, who having seen me advancing, and\r\nguessing my intent, had immediately converted himself into the object\r\naforesaid--I was so diverted at the ingenuity of the evasion, that I\r\nagreed to pardon his offence, refusing his note, however, that I might\r\nkeep a prosecution for felony hanging over his head, as a security for\r\nhis future good behaviour--But Timothy would by no means trust himself\r\nin my hands till the note was accepted--then he made his appearance at\r\nmy door as a blind beggar, and imposed in such a manner upon my man, who\r\nhad been his old acquaintance and pot-companion, that the fellow threw\r\nthe door in his face, and even threatened to give him the bastinado.\r\nHearing a noise in the hall, I went thither, and immediately\r\nrecollecting the figure I had passed in the street, accosted him by his\r\nown name, to the unspeakable astonishment of the footman.’\r\n\r\nBirkin declared he loved a joke as well as another; but asked if any of\r\nthe company could tell where Mr Cropdale lodged, that he might send him\r\na proposal about restitution, before the boots should be made away with.\r\n‘I would willingly give him a pair of new shoes (said he), and half a\r\nguinea into the bargain’ for the boots, which fitted me like a glove;\r\nand I shan’t be able to get the fellows of them ‘till the good weather\r\nfor riding is over. The stuttering wit declared, that the only secret\r\nwhich Cropdale ever kept, was the place of his lodgings; but he\r\nbelieved, that, during the heats of summer, he commonly took his\r\nrepose upon a bulk, or indulged himself, in fresco, with one of the\r\nkennel-nymphs, under the portico of St Martin’s church. ‘Pox on him!\r\n(cried the bookseller) he might as well have taken my whip and spurs. In\r\nthat case, he might have been tempted to steal another horse, and then\r\nhe would have rid to the devil of course.’\r\n\r\nAfter coffee, I took my leave of Mr S--, with proper acknowledgments of\r\nhis civility, and was extremely well pleased with the entertainment of\r\nthe day, though not yet satisfied, with respect to the nature of this\r\nconnexion, betwixt a man of character in the literary world, and a\r\nparcel of authorlings, who, in all probability, would never be able\r\nto acquire any degree of reputation by their labours. On this head\r\nI interrogated my conductor, Dick Ivy, who answered me to this\r\neffect--‘One would imagine S-- had some view to his own interest, in\r\ngiving countenance and assistance to those people, whom he knows to be\r\nbad men, as well as bad writers; but, if he has any such view, he will\r\nfind himself disappointed; for if he is so vain as to imagine he can\r\nmake them, subservient to his schemes of profit or ambition, they are\r\ncunning enough to make him their property in the mean time. There is not\r\none of the company you have seen to-day (myself excepted) who does\r\nnot owe him particular obligations--One of them he bailed out of a\r\nspunging-house, and afterwards paid the debt--another he translated into\r\nhis family, and clothed, when he was turned out half naked from jail in\r\nconsequence of an act for the relief of insolvent debtors--a third, who\r\nwas reduced to a woollen night cap, and lived upon sheeps trotters, up\r\nthree pair of stairs backward in Butcher-row, he took into present pay\r\nand free quarters, and enabled him to appear as a gentleman, without\r\nhaving the fear of sheriff’s officers before his eyes. Those who are in\r\ndistress he supplies with money when he has it, and with his credit when\r\nhe is out of cash. When they want business, he either finds employment\r\nfor them in his own service, or recommends them to booksellers to\r\nexecute some project he has formed for their subsistence. They are\r\nalways welcome to his table (which though plain, is plentiful) and to\r\nhis good offices as far as they will go, and when they see Occasion,\r\nthey make use of his name with the most petulant familiarity; nay, they\r\ndo not even scruple to arrogate to themselves the merit of some of his\r\nperformances, and have been known to sell their own lucubrations as the\r\nproduce of his brain. The Scotchman you saw at dinner once personated\r\nhim at an alehouse in West-Smithfield and, in the character of S--, had\r\nhis head broke by a cow-keeper, for having spoke disrespectfully of the\r\nChristian religion; but he took the law of him in his own person, and\r\nthe assailant was fain to give him ten pounds to withdraw his action.’\r\n\r\nI observed, that all this appearance of liberality on the side of Mr S--\r\nwas easily accounted for, on the supposition that they flattered him\r\nin private, and engaged his adversaries in public; and yet I was\r\nastonished, when I recollected that I often had seen this writer\r\nvirulently abused in papers, poems, and pamphlets, and not a pen was\r\ndrawn in his defence ‘But you will be more astonished (said he) when I\r\nassure you, those very guests whom you saw at his table to-day, were\r\nthe authors of great part of that abuse; and he himself is well aware\r\nof their particular favours, for they are all eager to detect and betray\r\none another.’ ‘But this is doing the devil’s work for nothing (cried I).\r\nWhat should induce them to revile their benefactor without provocation?’\r\n‘Envy (answered Dick) is the general incitement; but they are galled by\r\nan additional scourge of provocation. S-- directs a literary journal,\r\nin which their productions are necessarily brought to trial; and though\r\nmany of them have been treated with such lenity and favour as they\r\nlittle deserved, yet the slightest censure, such as, perhaps, could not\r\nbe avoided with any pretensions to candour and impartiality, has rankled\r\nin the hearts of those authors to such a degree, that they have taken\r\nimmediate vengeance on the critic in anonymous libels, letters,\r\nand lampoons. Indeed, all the writers of the age, good, bad, and\r\nindifferent, from the moment he assumed this office, became his enemies,\r\neither professed or in petto, except those of his friends who knew they\r\nhad nothing to fear from his strictures; and he must be a wiser man than\r\nme who can tell what advantage or satisfaction he derives from having\r\nbrought such a nest of hornets about his ears.’\r\n\r\nI owned, that was a point which might deserve consideration; but still\r\nI expressed a desire to know his real motives for continuing his\r\nfriendship to a set of rascals equally ungrateful and insignificant.--He\r\nsaid, he did not pretend to assign any reasonable motive; that, if\r\nthe truth must be told, the man was, in point of conduct, a most\r\nincorrigible fool; that, though he pretended to have a knack at hitting\r\noff characters, he blundered strangely in the distribution of his\r\nfavours, which were generally bestowed on the most undeserving of those\r\nwho had recourse to his assistance; that, indeed, this preference was\r\nnot so much owing to want of discernment as to want of resolution, for\r\nhe had not fortitude enough to resist the importunity even of the most\r\nworthless; and, as he did not know the value of money, there was very\r\nlittle merit in parting with it so easily; that his pride was gratified\r\nin seeing himself courted by such a number of literary dependents; that,\r\nprobably, he delighted in hearing them expose and traduce one another;\r\nand, finally, from their information, he became acquainted with all the\r\ntransactions of Grubstreet, which he had some thoughts of compiling for\r\nthe entertainment of the public.\r\n\r\nI could not help suspecting, from Dick’s discourse, that he had some\r\nparticular grudge against S--, upon whose conduct he had put the worst\r\nconstruction it would bear; and, by dint of cross-examination, I found\r\nhe was not at all satisfied with the character which had been given in\r\nthe Review of his last performance, though it had been treated civilly\r\nin consequence of the author’s application to the critic. By all\r\naccounts, S-- is not without weakness and caprice; but he is certainly\r\ngood-humoured and civilized; nor do I find that there is any thing\r\noverbearing, cruel, or implacable in his disposition.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt so long upon authors, that you will perhaps suspect I\r\nintend to enroll myself among the fraternity; but, if I were actually\r\nqualified for the profession, it is at best but a desperate resource\r\nagainst starving, as it affords no provision for old age and infirmity.\r\nSalmon, at the age of fourscore, is now in a garret, compiling matter,\r\nat a guinea a sheet, for a modern historian, who, in point of age, might\r\nbe his grandchild; and Psalmonazar, after having drudged half a century\r\nin the literary mill, in all the simplicity and abstinence of an\r\nAsiatic, subsists upon the charity of a few booksellers, just sufficient\r\nto keep him from the parish, I think Guy, who was himself a bookseller,\r\nought to have appropriated one wing or ward of his hospital to the use\r\nof decayed authors; though indeed, there is neither hospital, college,\r\nnor workhouse, within the bills of mortality, large enough to contain\r\nthe poor of this society, composed, as it is, from the refuse of every\r\nother profession.\r\n\r\nI know not whether you will find any amusement in this account of an odd\r\nrace of mortals, whose constitution had, I own, greatly interested the\r\ncuriosity of\r\n\r\nYours, J. MELFORD LONDON, June 10.\r\n\nTo Miss LAETITIA WILLIS, at Gloucester.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR LETTY,\r\n\r\nThere is something on my spirits, which I should not venture to\r\ncommunicate by the post, but having the opportunity of Mrs Brentwood’s\r\nreturn, I seize it eagerly, to disburthen my poor heart, which is\r\noppressed with fear and vexation.--O Letty! what a miserable situation\r\nit is, to be without a friend to whom one can apply for counsel and\r\nconsolation in distress! I hinted in my last, that one Mr Barton had\r\nbeen very particular in his civilities: I can no longer mistake his\r\nmeaning--he has formally professed himself my admirer; and, after\r\na thousand assiduities, perceiving I made but a cold return to his\r\naddresses, he had recourse to the mediation of lady Griskin, who has\r\nacted the part of a very warm advocate in his behalf:--but, my dear\r\nWillis, her ladyship over acts her part--she not only expatiates on the\r\nample fortune, the great connexions, and the unblemished character of\r\nMr Barton, but she takes the trouble to catechise me; and, two days ago,\r\nperemptorily told me, that a girl of my age could not possibly resist so\r\nmany considerations, if her heart was not pre-engaged.\r\n\r\nThis insinuation threw me into such a flutter, that she could not but\r\nobserve my disorder; and, presuming upon the discovery, insisted upon\r\nmy making her the confidante of my passion. But, although I had not such\r\ncommand of myself as to conceal the emotion of my heart, I am not such a\r\nchild as to disclose its secret to a person who would certainly use\r\nthem to its prejudice. I told her, it was no wonder if I was out of\r\ncountenance at her introducing a subject of conversation so unsuitable\r\nto my years and inexperience; that I believed Mr Barton was a very\r\nworthy gentleman, and I was much obliged to him for his good opinion;\r\nbut the affections were involuntary, and mine, in particular, had as\r\nyet made no concessions in his favour. She shook her head with an air of\r\ndistrust that made me tremble; and observed, that if my affections were\r\nfree, they would submit to the decision of prudence, especially when\r\nenforced by the authority of those who had a right to direct my conduct.\r\nThis remark implied a design to interest my uncle or my aunt, perhaps my\r\nbrother, in behalf of Mr Barton’s passion; and I am sadly afraid that\r\nmy aunt is already gained over. Yesterday in the forenoon, he had been\r\nwalking with us in the Park, and stopping in our return at a toy-shop,\r\nhe presented her with a very fine snuff-box, and me with a gold etuis,\r\nwhich I resolutely refused, till she commanded me to accept it on pain\r\nof her displeasure: nevertheless, being still unsatisfied with respect\r\nto the propriety of receiving this toy, I signified my doubts to my\r\nbrother, who said he would consult my uncle on the subject, and seemed\r\nto think Mr Barton had been rather premature in his presents.\r\n\r\nWhat will be the result of this consultation, Heaven knows; but I am\r\nafraid it will produce an explanation with Mr Barton, who will, no\r\ndoubt, avow his passion, and solicit their consent to a connexion which\r\nmy soul abhors; for, my dearest Letty, it is not in my power to love Mr\r\nBarton, even if my heart was untouched by any other tenderness. Not that\r\nthere is any thing disagreeable about his person, but there is a total\r\nwant of that nameless charm which captivates and controuls the inchanted\r\nspirit at least, he appears to me to have this defect; but if he had\r\nall the engaging qualifications which a man can possess, they would be\r\nexcited in vain against that constancy, which, I flatter myself, is the\r\ncharacteristic of my nature. No, my dear Willis, I may be involved in\r\nfresh troubles, and I believe I shall, from the importunities of this\r\ngentleman and the violence of my relations; but my heart is incapable of\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nYou know I put no faith in dreams; and yet I have been much disturbed\r\nby one that visited me last night.--I thought I was in a church, where\r\na certain person, whom you know, was on the point of being married to my\r\naunt; that the clergyman was Mr Barton, and that poor forlorn I, stood\r\nweeping in a corner, half naked, and without shoes or stockings.--Now,\r\nI know there is nothing so childish as to be moved by those vain\r\nillusions; but, nevertheless, in spite of all my reason, this hath\r\nmade a strong impression upon my mind, which begins to be very gloomy.\r\nIndeed, I have another more substantial cause of affliction--I have some\r\nreligious scruples, my dear friend, which lie heavy on my conscience.--I\r\nwas persuaded to go to the Tabernacle, where I heard a discourse that\r\naffected me deeply.--I have prayed fervently to be enlightened, but\r\nas yet I am not sensible of these inward motions, those operations of\r\ngrace, which are the signs of a regenerated spirit; and therefore I\r\nbegin to be in terrible apprehensions about the state of my poor soul.\r\nSome of our family have had very uncommon accessions, particularly\r\nmy aunt and Mrs Jenkins, who sometimes speak as if they were really\r\ninspired; so that I am not like to want for either exhortation or\r\nexample, to purify my thoughts, and recall them from the vanities of\r\nthis world, which, indeed, I would willingly resign, if it was in my\r\npower; but to make this sacrifice, I must be enabled by such assistance\r\nfrom above as hath not yet been indulged to\r\n\r\nYour unfortunate friend, LYDIA MELFORD June 10.\r\n\nTo Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of Jesus college, Oxon.\r\n\r\nDEAR PHILLIPS,\r\n\r\nThe moment I received your letter, I began to execute your\r\ncommission--With the assistance of mine host at the Bull and Gate, I\r\ndiscovered the place to which your fugitive valet had retreated, and\r\ntaxed him with his dishonesty--The fellow was in manifest confusion at\r\nsight of me, but he denied the charge with great confidence, till I told\r\nhim, that if he would give up the watch, which was a family piece, he\r\nmight keep the money and the clothes, and go to the devil his own way,\r\nat his leisure; but if he rejected this proposal, I would deliver him\r\nforthwith to the constable, whom I had provided for that purpose, and\r\nhe would carry him before the justice without further delay. After\r\nsome hesitation, he desired to speak with me in the next room, where he\r\nproduced the watch, with all its appendages, and I have delivered it to\r\nour landlord, to be sent you by the first safe conveyance.\r\n\r\nSo much for business.\r\n\r\nI shall grow vain, upon your saying you find entertainment in my\r\nletters; barren, as they certainly are, of incident and importance,\r\nbecause your amusement must arise, not from the matter, but from the\r\nmanner, which you know is all my own--Animated, therefore, by the\r\napprobation of a person, whose nice taste and consummate judgment I can\r\nno longer doubt, I will chearfully proceed with our memoirs--As it is\r\ndetermined we shall set out next week for Yorkshire, I went to-day in\r\nthe forenoon with my uncle to see a carriage, belonging to a coachmaker\r\nin our neighbourhood--Turning down a narrow lane, behind Longacre, we\r\nperceived a crowd of people standing at a door; which, it seems, opened\r\ninto a kind of a methodist meeting, and were informed, that a footman\r\nwas then holding forth to the congregation within. Curious to see this\r\nphoenomenon, we squeezed into the place with much difficulty; and who\r\nshould this preacher be, but the identical Humphry Clinker. He had\r\nfinished his sermon, and given out a psalm, the first stave of which he\r\nsung with peculiar graces--But if we were astonished to see Clinker in\r\nthe pulpit, we were altogether confounded at finding all the females\r\nof our family among the audience--There was lady Griskin, Mrs Tabitha\r\nBramble, Mrs Winifred Jenkins, my sister Liddy, and Mr Barton, and all\r\nof them joined in the psalmody, with strong marks of devotion.\r\n\r\nI could hardly keep my gravity on this ludicrous occasion; but old\r\nSquare-toes was differently affected--The first thing that struck him,\r\nwas the presumption of his lacquey, whom he commanded to come down, with\r\nsuch an air of authority as Humphry did not think proper to disregard.\r\nHe descended immediately, and all the people were in commotion. Barton\r\nlooked exceedingly sheepish, lady Griskin flirted her fan, Mrs Tabby\r\ngroaned in spirit, Liddy changed countenance, and Mrs Jenkins sobbed as\r\nif her heart was breaking--My uncle, with a sneer, asked pardon of the\r\nladies, for having interrupted their devotion, saying, he had particular\r\nbusiness with the preacher, whom he ordered to call a hackney-coach.\r\nThis being immediately brought up to the end of the lane, he handed\r\nLiddy into it, and my aunt and I following him, we drove home, without\r\ntaking any further notice of the rest of the company, who still remained\r\nin silent astonishment.\r\n\r\nMr Bramble, perceiving Liddy in great trepidation, assumed a milder\r\naspect, bidding her be under no concern, for he was not at all\r\ndispleased at any thing she had done--‘I have no objection (said he)\r\nto your being religiously inclined; but I don’t think my servant is a\r\nproper ghostly director for a devotee of your sex and character--if,\r\nin fact (as I rather believe) your aunt is not the sole conductress of,\r\nthis machine’--Mrs Tabitha made no answer, but threw up the whites of\r\nher eyes, as if in the act of ejaculation--Poor Liddy, said, she had no\r\nright to the title of a devotee; that she thought there was no harm in\r\nhearing a pious discourse, even if it came from a footman, especially\r\nas her aunt was present; but that if she had erred from ignorance, she\r\nhoped he would excuse it, as she could not bear the thoughts of living\r\nunder his displeasure. The old gentleman, pressing her hand with a\r\ntender smile, said she was a good girl, and that he did not believe\r\nher capable of doing any thing that could give him the least umbrage or\r\ndisgust.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at our lodgings, he commanded Mr Clinker to attend him\r\nup stairs, and spoke to him in these words--‘Since you are called upon\r\nby the spirit to preach and to teach, it is high time to lay aside the\r\nlivery of an earthly master; and for my part, I am unworthy to have an\r\napostle in my service’--‘I hope (said Humphry) I have not failed in my\r\nduty to your honour--I should be a vile wretch if I did, considering the\r\nmisery from which your charity and compassion relieved me--but having\r\nan inward admonition of the spirit--’ ‘An admonition of the devil (cried\r\nthe squire, in a passion) What admonition, you blockhead? What right has\r\nsuch a fellow as you to set up for a reformer?’ ‘Begging your honour’s\r\npardon (replied Clinker) may not the new light of God’s grace shine\r\nupon the poor and the ignorant in their humility, as well as upon the\r\nwealthy, and the philosopher in all his pride of human learning?’ ‘What\r\nyou imagine to be the new light of grace (said his master) I take to be\r\na deceitful vapour, glimmering through a crack in your upper story--In\r\na word, Mr Clinker, I will have no light in my family but what pays the\r\nking’s taxes, unless it be the light of reason, which you don’t pretend\r\nto follow.’\r\n\r\n‘Ah, sir! (cried Humphry) the light of reason, is no more in comparison\r\nto the light I mean, than a farthing candle to the sun at noon’--‘Very\r\ntrue (said uncle), the one will serve to shew you your way, and the\r\nother to dazzle and confound your weak brain. Heark ye, Clinker, you\r\nare either an hypocritical knave, or a wrong-headed enthusiast; and in\r\neither case, unfit for my service. If you are a quack in sanctity and\r\ndevotion, you will find it an easy matter to impose upon silly women,\r\nand others of crazed understanding, who will contribute lavishly for\r\nyour support. If you are really seduced by the reveries of a disturbed\r\nimagination, the sooner you lose your senses entirely, the better for\r\nyourself and the community. In that case, some charitable person might\r\nprovide you with a dark room and clean straw in Bedlam, where it would\r\nnot be in your power to infect others with your fanaticism; whereas,\r\nif you have just reflection enough left to maintain the character of a\r\nchosen vessel in the meetings of the godly, you and your hearers will be\r\nmisled by a Will-i’the-wisp, from one error into another, till you are\r\nplunged into religious frenzy; and then, perhaps, you will hang yourself\r\nin despair’ ‘Which the Lord of his infinite mercy forbid! (exclaimed the\r\naffrighted Clinker) It is very possible I may be under the temptation of\r\nthe devil, who wants to wreck me on the rocks of spiritual pride--Your\r\nhonour says, I am either a knave or a madman; now, as I’ll assure your\r\nhonour, I am no knave, it follows that I must be mad; therefore, I\r\nbeseech your honour, upon my knees, to take my case into consideration,\r\nthat means may be used for my recovery’\r\n\r\nThe ‘squire could not help smiling at the poor fellow’s simplicity, and\r\npromised to take care of him, provided he would mind the business of his\r\nplace, without running after the new light of methodism: but Mrs Tabitha\r\ntook offence at his humility, which she interpreted into poorness\r\nof spirit and worldly mindedness. She upbraided him with the want of\r\ncourage to suffer for conscience sake--She observed, that if he should\r\nlose his place for bearing testimony to the truth, Providence would not\r\nfail to find him another, perhaps more advantageous; and, declaring that\r\nit could not be very agreeable to live in a family where an inquisition\r\nwas established, retired to another room in great agitation.\r\n\r\nMy uncle followed her with a significant look, then, turning to the\r\npreacher, ‘You hear what my sister says--If you cannot live with me upon\r\nsuch terms as I have prescribed, the vineyard of methodism lies before\r\nyou, and she seems very well disposed to reward your labour’--‘I would\r\nnot willingly give offence to any soul upon earth (answered Humphry);\r\nher ladyship has been very good to me, ever since we came to London; and\r\nsurely she has a heart turned for religious exercises; and both she and\r\nlady Griskin sing psalms and hymns like two cherubims--But, at the same\r\ntime, I’m bound to love and obey your honour--It becometh not such a\r\npoor ignorant fellow as me, to hold dispute with gentlemen of rank and\r\nlearning--As for the matter of knowledge, I am no more than a beast in\r\ncomparison of your honour; therefore I submit; and, with God’s grace, I\r\nwill follow you to the world’s end, if you don’t think me too far gone\r\nto be out of confinement’.\r\n\r\nHis master promised to keep him for some time longer on trial; then\r\ndesired to know in what manner lady Griskin and Mr Barton came to join\r\ntheir religious society, he told him, that her ladyship was the person\r\nwho first carried my aunt and sister to the Tabernacle, whither he\r\nattended them, and had his devotion kindled by Mr W--‘s preaching: that\r\nhe was confirmed in this new way, by the preacher’s sermons, which he\r\nhad bought and studied with great attention: that his discourse and\r\nprayers had brought over Mrs Jenkins and the house-maid to the same\r\nway of thinking; but as for Mr Barton, he had never seen him at service\r\nbefore this day, when he came in company with lady Griskin. Humphry,\r\nmoreover, owned that he had been encouraged to mount the rostrum, by\r\nthe example and success of a weaver, who was much followed as a powerful\r\nminister: that on his first trial he found himself under such strong\r\nimpulsions, as made him believe he was certainly moved by the spirit;\r\nand that he had assisted in lady Griskin’s, and several private houses,\r\nat exercises of devotion.\r\n\r\nMr Bramble was no sooner informed, that her ladyship had acted as the\r\nprimum mobile of this confederacy, than he concluded she had only made\r\nuse of Clinker as a tool, subservient to the execution of some design,\r\nto the true secret of which he was an utter stranger--He observed, that\r\nher ladyship’s brain was a perfect mill for projects; and that she and\r\nTabby had certainly engaged in some secret treaty, the nature of which\r\nhe could not comprehend. I told him I thought it was no difficult matter\r\nto perceive the drift of Mrs Tabitha, which was to ensnare the heart\r\nof Barton, and that in all likelihood my lady Griskin acted as her\r\nauxiliary: that this supposition would account for their endeavours to\r\nconvert him to methodism; an event which would occasion a connexion of\r\nsouls that might be easily improved into a matrimonial union.\r\n\r\nMy uncle seemed to be much diverted by the thoughts of this Scheme’s\r\nsucceeding; but I gave him to understand, that Barton was pre-engaged:\r\nthat he had the day before made a present of an etuis to Liddy,\r\nwhich her aunt had obliged her to receive, with a view, no doubt, to\r\ncountenance her own accepting of a snuff-box at the same time; that my\r\nsister having made me acquainted with this incident, I had desired an\r\nexplanation of Mr Barton, who declared his intentions were honourable,\r\nand expressed his hope that I would have no objections to his alliance;\r\nthat I had thanked him for the honour he intended our family; but told\r\nhim, it would be necessary to consult her uncle and aunt, who were\r\nher guardians; and their approbation being obtained, I could have no\r\nobjection to his proposal; though I was persuaded that no violence would\r\nbe offered to my sister’s inclinations, in a transaction that so nearly\r\ninterested the happiness of her future life: that he had assured me, he\r\nshould never think of availing himself of a guardian’s authority, unless\r\nhe could render his addresses agreeable to the young lady herself; and\r\nthat he would immediately demand permission of Mr and Mrs Bramble, to\r\nmake Liddy a tender of his hand and fortune.\r\n\r\nThe squire was not insensible to the advantages of such a match, and\r\ndeclared he would promote it with all his influence; but when I took\r\nnotice that there seemed to be an aversion on the side of Liddy, he said\r\nhe would sound her on the subject; and if her reluctance was such as\r\nwould not be easily overcome, he would civilly decline the proposal of\r\nMr Barton; for he thought that, in the choice of a husband a young woman\r\nought not to sacrifice the feelings of her heart for any consideration\r\nupon earth--‘Liddy is not so desperate (said he) as to worship fortune\r\nat such an expence.’\r\n\r\nI take it for granted, this whole affair will end in smoke; though there\r\nseems to be a storm brewing in the quarter of Mrs Tabby, who sat with\r\nall the sullen dignity of silence at dinner, seemingly pregnant with\r\ncomplaint and expostulation. As she had certainly marked Barton for her\r\nown prey, she cannot possibly favour his suit to Liddy; and therefore\r\nI expect something extraordinary will attend his declaring himself my\r\nsister’s admirer. This declaration will certainly be made in form, as\r\nsoon as the lover can pick up resolution enough to stand the brunt\r\nof Mrs Tabby’s disappointment; for he is, without doubt, aware of her\r\ndesigns upon his person--The particulars of the denouement you shall\r\nknow in due season: mean while I am\r\n\r\nAlways yours, J. MELFORD LONDON, June 10.\r\n\nTo Dr LEWIS.\r\n\r\nDEAR LEWIS,\r\n\r\nThe deceitful calm was of short duration. I am plunged again in a sea of\r\nvexation, and the complaints in my stomach and bowels are returned; so\r\nthat I suppose I shall be disabled from prosecuting the excursion I had\r\nplanned--What the devil had I to do, to come a plague hunting with a\r\nleash of females in my train? Yesterday my precious sister (who, by\r\nthe bye, has been for some time a professed methodist) came into my\r\napartment, attended by Mr Barton, and desired an audience with a very\r\nstately air--‘Brother (said she), this gentleman has something to\r\npropose, which I flatter myself will be the more acceptable, as it will\r\nrid you of a troublesome companion.’ Then Mr Barton proceeded to this\r\neffect--‘I am, indeed, extremely ambitious of being allied to your\r\nfamily, Mr Bramble, and I hope you will see no cause to interpose your\r\nauthority.’ ‘As for authority (said Tabby, interrupting him with some\r\nwarmth), I know of none that he has a right to use on this occasion--If\r\nI pay him the compliment of making him acquainted with the step I intend\r\nto take, it is all he can expect in reason--This is as much as I\r\nbelieve he would do by me, if he intended to change his own situation in\r\nlife--In a word, brother, I am so sensible of Mr Barton’s extra ordinary\r\nmerit, that I have been prevailed upon to alter my resolution of living\r\na single life, and to put my happiness in his hands, by vesting him with\r\na legal title to my person and fortune, such as they are. The business\r\nat present, is to have the writings drawn; and I shall be obliged to\r\nyou, if you will recommend a lawyer to me for that purpose’\r\n\r\nYou may guess what an effect this overture had upon me; who, from the\r\ninformation of my nephew, expected that Barton was to make a formal\r\ndeclaration of his passion for Liddy; I could not help gazing in silent\r\nastonishment, alternately at Tabby, and her supposed admirer, who last\r\nhung his head in the most aukward confusion for a few minutes, and then\r\nretired on pretence of being suddenly seized with a vertigo--Mrs Tabitha\r\naffected much concern, and would have had him make use of a bed in the\r\nhouse; but he insisted upon going home, that he might have recourse\r\nof some drops, which he kept for such emergencies, and his innamorata\r\nacquiesced--In the mean time I was exceedingly puzzled at this adventure\r\n(though I suspected the truth) and did not know in what manner to demean\r\nmyself towards Mrs Tabitha, when Jery came in and told me, he had just\r\nseen Mr Barton alight from his chariot at lady Griskin’s door--This\r\nincident seemed to threaten a visit from her ladyship, with which we\r\nwere honoured accordingly, in less than half an hour--‘I find (said she)\r\nthere has been a match of cross purposes among you good folks; and\r\nI’m come to set you to rights’--So saying, she presented me with the\r\nfollowing billet\r\n\r\n‘DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI no sooner recollected myself from the extreme confusion I was thrown\r\ninto, by that unlucky mistake of your sister, than I thought it my duty\r\nto assure you, that my devoirs to Mrs Bramble never exceeded the bounds\r\nof ordinary civility; and that my heart is unalterably fixed upon Miss\r\nLiddy Melford, as I had the honour to declare to her brother, when he\r\nquestioned me upon that subject--Lady Griskin has been so good as to\r\ncharge herself, not only with the delivery of this note, but also with\r\nthe task of undeceiving Mrs Bramble, for whom I have the most profound\r\nrespect and veneration, though my affection being otherwise engaged is\r\nno longer in the power of\r\n\r\nSir, Your very humble servant, RALPH BARTON.’\r\n\r\nHaving cast my eyes over this billet, I told her ladyship, that I would\r\nno longer retard the friendly office she had undertaken: and I and\r\nJery forthwith retired into another room. There we soon perceived the\r\nconversation grow very warm betwixt the two ladies; and, at length,\r\ncould distinctly hear certain terms of altercation, which we could no\r\nlonger delay interrupting, with any regard to decorum. When we entered\r\nthe scene of contention, we found Liddy had joined the disputants, and\r\nstood trembling betwixt them, as if she had been afraid they would have\r\nproceeded to something more practical than words. Lady Griskin’s\r\nface was like the full moon in a storm of wind, glaring, fiery,\r\nand portentous; while Tabby looked grim and ghastly, with an aspect\r\nbreathing discord and dismay.--Our appearance put a stop to their mutual\r\nrevilings; but her ladyship turning to me, ‘Cousin (said she) I can’t\r\nhelp saying I have met with a very ungrateful return from this lady, for\r\nthe pains I have taken to serve her family’--‘My family is much obliged\r\nto your ladyship (cried Tabby, with a kind of hysterical giggle); but\r\nwe have no right to the good offices of such an honourable go-between.’\r\n‘But, for all that, good Mrs Tabitha Bramble (resumed the other), I\r\nshall be content with the reflection, That virtue is its own reward;\r\nand it shall not be my fault, if you continue to make yourself\r\nridiculous--Mr Bramble, who has no little interest of his own to serve,\r\nwill, no doubt, contribute all in his power to promote a match\r\nbetwixt Mr Barton and his niece, which will be equally honourable and\r\nadvantageous; and, I dare say, Miss Liddy herself will have no objection\r\nto a measure so well calculated to make her happy in life’--‘I beg your\r\nladyship’s pardon (exclaimed Liddy, with great vivacity) I have nothing\r\nbut misery to expect from such a measure; and I hope my guardians\r\nwill have too much compassion, to barter my peace of mind for any\r\nconsideration of interest or fortune’--‘Upon my word, Miss Liddy! (said\r\nshe) you have profited by the example of your good aunt--I comprehend\r\nyour meaning, and will explain it when I have a proper opportunity--In\r\nthe mean time, I shall take my leave--Madam, your most obedient, and\r\ndevoted humble servant,’ said she, advancing close up to my sister, and\r\ncurtsying so low, that I thought she intended to squat herself down on\r\nthe floor--This salutation Tabby returned with equal solemnity; and\r\nthe expression of the two faces, while they continued in this attitude,\r\nwould be no bad subject for a pencil like that of the incomparable\r\nHogarth, if any such should ever appear again, in these times of\r\ndullness and degeneracy.\r\n\r\nJery accompanied her ladyship to her house, that he might have an\r\nopportunity to restore the etuis to Barton, and advise him to give\r\nup his suit, which was so disagreeable to his sister, against whom,\r\nhowever, he returned much irritated--Lady Griskin had assured him that\r\nLiddy’s heart was pre-occupied; and immediately the idea of Wilson\r\nrecurring to his imagination, his family-pride took the alarm. He\r\ndenounced vengeance against the adventurer, and was disposed to be\r\nvery peremptory with his sister; but I desired he would suppress his\r\nresentment, until I should have talked with her in private.\r\n\r\nThe poor girl, when I earnestly pressed her on this head, owned with\r\na flood of tears, that Wilson had actually come to the Hot Well at\r\nBristol, and even introduced himself into our lodgings as a Jew pedlar;\r\nbut that nothing had passed betwixt them, further than her begging him\r\nto withdraw immediately, if he had any regard for her peace of mind:\r\nthat he had disappeared accordingly, after having attempted to prevail\r\nupon my sister’s maid, to deliver a letter; which, however, she refused\r\nto receive, though she had consented to carry a message, importing that\r\nhe was a gentleman of a good family; and that, in a very little time, he\r\nwould avow his passion in that character--She confessed, that although\r\nhe had not kept his word in this particular, he was not yet altogether\r\nindifferent to her affection; but solemnly promised, she would never\r\ncarry on any correspondence with him, or any other admirer, for the\r\nfuture, without the privity and approbation of her brother and me.\r\n\r\nBy this declaration, she made her own peace with Jery; but the\r\nhot-headed boy is more than ever incensed against Wilson, whom he now\r\nconsiders as an impostor, that harbours some infamous design upon the\r\nhonour of his family--As for Barton he was not a little mortified to\r\nfind his present returned, and his addresses so unfavourably received;\r\nbut he is not a man to be deeply affected by such disappointments; and\r\nI know not whether he is not as well pleased with being discarded\r\nby Liddy, as he would have been with a permission to prosecute his\r\npretensions, at the risque of being every day exposed to the revenge or\r\nmachinations of Tabby, who is not to be slighted with impunity.--I\r\nhad not much time to moralize on these occurrences; for the house\r\nwas visited by a constable and his gang, with a warrant from Justice\r\nBuzzard, to search the box of Humphry Clinker, my footman,--who was just\r\napprehended as a highwayman. This incident threw the whole family into\r\nconfusion. My sister scolded the constable for presuming to enter the\r\nlodgings of a gentleman on such an errand, without having first asked,\r\nand obtained permission; her maid was frightened into fits, and Liddy\r\nshed tears of compassion for the unfortunate Clinker, in whose box,\r\nhowever, nothing was found to confirm the suspicion of robbery.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I made no doubt of the fellow’s being mistaken for some\r\nother person, and I went directly to the justice, in order to procure\r\nhis discharge; but there I found the matter much more serious than\r\nI expected--Poor Clinker stood trembling at the bar, surrounded by\r\nthief-takers; and at a little distance, a thick, squat fellow, a\r\npostilion, his accuser, who had seized him on the street, and swore\r\npositively to his person, that the said Clinker had, on the 15th day of\r\nMarch last, on Blackheath, robbed a gentleman in a post-chaise, which\r\nhe (the postilion) drove--This deposition was sufficient to justify his\r\ncommitment; and he was sent accordingly to Clerkenwell prison, whither\r\nJery accompanied him in the coach, in order to recommend him properly to\r\nthe keeper, that he may want for no convenience which the place affords.\r\n\r\nThe spectators, who assembled to see this highwayman, were sagacious\r\nenough to discern something very villainous in his aspect; which\r\n(begging their pardon) is the very picture of simplicity; and the\r\njustice himself put a very unfavourable construction upon some of his\r\nanswers, which, he said, savoured of the ambiguity and equivocation of\r\nan old offender; but, in my opinion, it would have been more just and\r\nhumane to impute them to the confusion into which we may suppose a poor\r\ncountry lad to be thrown on such an occasion. I am still persuaded he is\r\ninnocent; and, in this persuasion, I can do no less than use my utmost\r\nendeavours that he may not be oppressed--I shall, to-morrow, send my\r\nnephew to wait on the gentleman who was robbed, and beg; he will have\r\nthe humanity to go and see the prisoner; that, in case he should find\r\nhim quite different from the person of the highwayman, he may bear\r\ntestimony in his behalf--Howsoever it may fare with Clinker, this cursed\r\naffair will be to me productive of intolerable chagrin--I have already\r\ncaught a dreadful cold, by rushing into the open air from the justice’s\r\nparlour, where I had been stewing in the crowd; and though I should not\r\nbe laid up with the gout, as I believe I shall, I must stay at London\r\nfor some weeks, till this poor devil comes to his trial at Rochester; so\r\nthat, in all probability, my northern expedition is blown up.\r\n\r\nIf you can find any thing in your philosophical budget, to console me\r\nin the midst of these distresses and apprehensions, pray let it be\r\ncommunicated to\r\n\r\nYour unfortunate friend, MATT. BRAMBLE LONDON, June 12.\r\n\nTo Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of Jesus college, Oxon.\r\n\r\nDEAR WAT,\r\n\r\nThe farce is finished, and another piece of a graver cast brought upon\r\nthe stage.--Our aunt made a desperate attack upon Barton, who had no\r\nother way of saving himself, but by leaving her in possession of\r\nthe field, and avowing his pretensions to Liddy, by whom he has been\r\nrejected in his turn.--Lady Griskin acted as his advocate and agent on\r\nthis occasion, with such zeal as embroiled her with Mrs Tabitha, and a\r\nhigh scene of altercation passed betwixt these two religionists, which\r\nmight have come to action, had not my uncle interposed. They are however\r\nreconciled, in consequence of an event which hath involved us all in\r\ntrouble and disquiet. You must know, the poor preacher, Humphry Clinker,\r\nis now exercising his ministry among the felons in Clerkenwell prison--A\r\npostilion having sworn a robbery against him, no bail could be taken,\r\nand he was committed to jail, notwithstanding all the remonstrances and\r\ninterest my uncle could make in his behalf.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, the poor fellow cannot possibly be guilty,\r\nand yet, I believe, he runs some risque of being hanged. Upon his\r\nexamination, he answered with such hesitation and reserve as persuaded\r\nmost of the people, who crowded the place, that he was really a knave,\r\nand the justice’s remarks confirmed their opinion. Exclusive of my uncle\r\nand myself, there was only one person who seemed inclined to favour\r\nthe culprit.--He was a young man, well dressed, and, from the manner in\r\nwhich he cross-examined the evidence, we took it for granted, that\r\nhe was a student in one of the inns of court.--He freely checked the\r\njustice for some uncharitable inferences he made to the prejudice of\r\nthe prisoner, and even ventured to dispute with his worship on certain\r\npoints of law.\r\n\r\nMy uncle, provoked at the unconnected and dubious answers of Clinker,\r\nwho seemed in danger of falling a sacrifice to his own simplicity,\r\nexclaimed, ‘In the name of God, if you are innocent, say so.’ ‘No (cried\r\nhe) God forbid that I should call myself innocent, while my conscience\r\nis burthened with sin.’ ‘What then, you did commit this robbery?’\r\nresumed his master. ‘No, sure (said he) blessed be the Lord, I’m free of\r\nthat guilt.’\r\n\r\nHere the justice interposed, observing, that the man seemed inclined to\r\nmake a discovery by turning king’s evidence, and desired the clerk to\r\ntake his confession; upon which Humphry declared, that he looked upon\r\nconfession to be a popish fraud, invented by the whore of Babylon. The\r\nTemplar affirmed, that the poor fellow was non compos; and exhorted the\r\njustice to discharge him as a lunatic.--‘You know very well (added he)\r\nthat the robbery in question was not committed by the prisoner.’\r\n\r\nThe thief-takers grinned at one another; and Mr Justice Buzzard\r\nreplied with great emotion, ‘Mr Martin, I desire you will mind your\r\nown business; I shall convince you one of these days that I understand\r\nmine.’ In short, there was no remedy; the mittimus was made out,\r\nand poor Clinker sent to prison in a hackney-coach, guarded by the\r\nconstable, and accompanied by your humble servant. By the way, I was not\r\na little surprised to hear this retainer to justice bid the prisoner to\r\nkeep up his spirits, for that he did not at all doubt but that he would\r\nget off for a few weeks confinement--He said, his worship knew very well\r\nthat Clinker was innocent of the fact, and that the real highwayman who\r\nrobbed the chaise, was no other than that very individual Mr Martin, who\r\nhad pleaded so strenuously for honest Humphry.\r\n\r\nConfounded at this information, I asked, ‘Why then is he suffered to\r\ngo about at his liberty, and this poor innocent fellow treated as a\r\nmalefactor?’ ‘We have exact intelligence of all Mr Martin’s transactions\r\n(said he); but as yet there is not evidence sufficient for his\r\nconviction; and as for this young man, the justice could do no less than\r\ncommit him, as the postilion swore point-blank to his identity.’ ‘So\r\nif this rascally postilion should persist in the falsity to which he is\r\nsworn (said I), this innocent lad may be brought to the gallows.’\r\n\r\nThe constable observed, that he would have time enough to prepare\r\nfor his trial, and might prove an alibi; or, perhaps, Martin might be\r\napprehended and convicted for another fact; in which case, he might be\r\nprevailed upon to take this affair upon himself; or, finally, if these\r\nchances should fail, and the evidence stand good against Clinker,\r\nthe jury might recommend him to mercy, in consideration of his youth,\r\nespecially if this should appear to be the first fact of which he had\r\nbeen guilty.\r\n\r\nHumphry owned he could not pretend to recollect where he had been on the\r\nday when the robbery was committed, much less prove a circumstance of\r\nthat kind so far back as six months, though he knew he had been sick\r\nof the fever and ague, which, however, did not prevent him from going\r\nabout--then, turning up his eyes, he ejaculated, ‘The Lord’s will be\r\ndone! if it be my fate to suffer, I hope I shall not disgrace the faith\r\nof which, though unworthy, I make profession.’\r\n\r\nWhen I expressed my surprize that the accuser should persist in charging\r\nClinker, without taking the least notice of the real robber who\r\nstood before him, and to whom, indeed, Humphry bore not the smallest\r\nresemblance; the constable (who was himself a thief-taker) gave me to\r\nunderstand, that Mr Martin was the best qualified for business of all\r\nthe gentlemen on the road he had ever known; that he had always acted on\r\nhis own bottom, without partner or correspondent, and never went to work\r\nbut when he was cool and sober; that his courage and presence of mind\r\nnever failed him; that his address was genteel, and his behaviour void\r\nof all cruelty and insolence; that he never encumbered himself with\r\nwatches or trinkets, nor even with bank-notes, but always dealt for\r\nready money, and that in the current coin of the kingdom; and that he\r\ncould disguise himself and his horse in such a manner, that, after\r\nthe action, it was impossible to recognize either the one or the\r\nother--‘This great man (said he) has reigned paramount in all the roads\r\nwithin fifty miles of London above fifteen months, and has done more\r\nbusiness in that time, than all the rest of the profession put together;\r\nfor those who pass through his hands are so delicately dealt with, that\r\nthey have no desire to give him the least disturbance; but for all that,\r\nhis race is almost run--he is now fluttering about justice, like a moth\r\nabout a candle--there are so many lime-twigs laid in his way, that I’ll\r\nbet a cool hundred, he swings before Christmas.’\r\n\r\nShall I own to you, that this portrait, drawn by a ruffian, heightened\r\nby what I myself had observed in his deportment, has interested me\r\nwarmly in the fate of poor Martin, whom nature seems to have intended\r\nfor a useful and honourable member of that community upon which he now\r\npreys for subsistence? It seems, he lived some time as a clerk to a\r\ntimber-merchant, whose daughter Martin having privately married, was\r\ndiscarded, and his wife turned out of doors. She did not long survive\r\nher marriage; and Martin, turning fortune-hunter, could not supply his\r\noccasions any other way, than by taking to the road, in which he\r\nhas travelled hitherto with uncommon success.--He pays his respects\r\nregularly to Mr Justice Buzzard, the thief-catcher-general of this\r\nmetropolis, and sometimes they smoke a pipe together very lovingly,\r\nwhen the conversation generally turns upon the nature of evidence.--The\r\njustice has given him fair warning to take care of himself, and he has\r\nreceived his caution in good part.--Hitherto he has baffled all the\r\nvigilance, art, and activity of Buzzard and his emissaries, with\r\nsuch conduct as would have done honour to the genius of a Caesar or\r\na Turenne; but he has one weakness, which has proved fatal to all the\r\nheroes of his tribe, namely, an indiscreet devotion to the fair sex, and\r\nin all probability, he will be attacked on this defenceless quarter.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, I saw the body of poor Clinker consigned to the\r\ngaoler of Clerkenwell, to whose indulgence I recommended him so\r\neffectually, that he received him in the most hospitable manner, though\r\nthere was a necessity for equipping him with a suit of irons, in which\r\nhe made a very rueful appearance. The poor creature seemed as much\r\naffected by my uncle’s kindness, as by his own misfortune. When I\r\nassured him, that nothing should be left undone for procuring his\r\nenlargement, and making his confinement easy in the mean time, he fell\r\ndown on his knees, and kissing my hand, which he bathed with his tears,\r\n‘0 ‘squire! (cried he, sobbing) what shall I say?--I can’t--no, I can’t\r\nspeak--my poor heart is bursting with gratitude to you and my dear--dear\r\ngenerous--noble benefactor.’\r\n\r\nI protest, the scene became so pathetic, that I was fain to force myself\r\naway, and returned to my uncle, who sent me in the afternoon with\r\na compliment to one Mr Mead, the person who had been robbed on\r\nBlack-heath. As I did not find him at home, I left a message, in\r\nconsequence of which he called at our lodgings this morning, and very\r\nhumanely agreed to visit the prisoner. By this time, lady Griskin had\r\ncome to make her formal compliments of condolance to Mrs Tabitha, on\r\nthis domestic calamity; and that prudent maiden, whose passion was\r\nnow cooled, thought proper to receive her ladyship so civilly, that a\r\nreconciliation immediately ensued. These two ladies resolved to comfort\r\nthe poor prisoner in their own persons, and Mr Mead and I ‘squired\r\nthem to Clerkenwell, my uncle being detained at home by some slight\r\ncomplaints in his stomach and bowels.\r\n\r\nThe turnkey, who received us at Clerkenwell, looked remarkably sullen;\r\nand when we enquired for Clinker, ‘I don’t care, if the devil had him\r\n(said he); here has been nothing but canting and praying since the\r\nfellow entered the place.--Rabbit him! the tap will be ruined--we han’t\r\nsold a cask of beer, nor a dozen of wine, since he paid his garnish--the\r\ngentlemen get drunk with nothing but your damned religion.--For my part,\r\nI believe as how your man deals with the devil.--Two or three as bold\r\nhearts as ever took the air upon Hounslow have been blubbering all\r\nnight; and if the fellow an’t speedily removed by Habeas Corpus, or\r\notherwise, I’ll be damn’d if there’s a grain of true spirit left within\r\nthese walls we shan’t have a soul to do credit to the place, or make his\r\nexit like a true born Englishman--damn my eyes! there will be nothing\r\nbut snivelling in the cart--we shall all die like so many psalm-singing\r\nweavers.’\r\n\r\nIn short, we found that Humphry was, at that very instant, haranguing\r\nthe felons in the chapel; and that the gaoler’s wife and daughter,\r\ntogether with my aunt’s woman, Win Jenkins, and our house-maid, were\r\namong the audience, which we immediately joined. I never saw any thing\r\nso strongly picturesque as this congregation of felons clanking their\r\nchains, in the midst of whom stood orator Clinker, expatiating in a\r\ntransport of fervor, on the torments of hell, denounced in scripture\r\nagainst evil-doers, comprehending murderers, robbers, thieves, and\r\nwhore mongers. The variety of attention exhibited in the faces of those\r\nragamuffins, formed a groupe that would not have disgraced the pencil of\r\na Raphael. In one, it denoted admiration; in another, doubt; in a\r\nthird, disdain; in a fourth, contempt; in a fifth, terror; in a sixth,\r\nderision; and in a seventh, indignation.--As for Mrs Winifred Jenkins,\r\nshe was in tears, overwhelmed with sorrow; but whether for her own sins,\r\nor the misfortune of Clinker, I cannot pretend to say. The other females\r\nseemed to listen with a mixture of wonder and devotion. The gaoler’s\r\nwife declared he was a saint in trouble, saying, she wished from her\r\nheart there was such another good soul, like him, in every gaol in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nMr Mead, having earnestly surveyed the preacher, declared his appearance\r\nwas so different from that of the person who robbed him on Black-heath,\r\nthat he could freely make oath he was not the man: but Humphry himself\r\nwas by this time pretty well rid of all apprehensions of being hanged;\r\nfor he had been the night before solemnly tried and acquitted by his\r\nfellow prisoners, some of whom he had already converted to methodism.\r\nHe now made proper acknowledgments for the honour of our visit, and was\r\npermitted to kiss the hands of the ladies, who assured him, he might\r\ndepend upon their friendship and protection. Lady Griskin, in her\r\ngreat zeal, exhorted his fellow-prisoners to profit by the precious\r\nopportunity of having such a saint in bonds among them, and turn over a\r\nnew leaf for the benefit of their poor souls; and, that her admonition\r\nmight have the greater effect, she reinforced it with her bounty.\r\n\r\nWhile she and Mrs Tabby returned in the coach with the two maidservants,\r\nI waited on Mr Mead to the house of justice Buzzard, who, having heard\r\nhis declaration, said his oath could be of no use at present, but that\r\nhe would be a material evidence for the prisoner at his trial; so that\r\nthere seems to be no remedy but patience for poor Clinker; and, indeed,\r\nthe same virtue, or medicine, will be necessary for us all, the\r\nsquire in particular, who had set his heart upon his excursion to the\r\nnorthward.\r\n\r\nWhile we were visiting honest Humphry in Clerkenwell prison, my uncle\r\nreceived a much more extraordinary visit at his own lodgings. Mr Martin,\r\nof whom I have made such honourable mention, desired permission to pay\r\nhim his respects, and was admitted accordingly. He told him, that\r\nhaving observed him, at Mr Buzzard’s, a good deal disturbed by what had\r\nhappened to his servant, he had come to assure him he had nothing to\r\napprehend for Clinker’s life; for, if it was possible that any jury\r\ncould find him guilty upon such evidence, he, Martin himself, would\r\nproduce in court a person, whose deposition would bring him off clear as\r\nthe sun at noon.--Sure, the fellow would not be so romantic as to\r\ntake the robbery upon himself!--He said, the postilion was an infamous\r\nfellow, who had been a dabbler in the same profession, and saved his\r\nlife at the Old Bailey by impeaching his companions; that being now\r\nreduced to great poverty, he had made this desperate push, to swear\r\naway the life of an innocent man, in hopes of having the reward upon his\r\nconviction; but that he would find himself miserably disappointed, for\r\nthe justice and his myrmidons were determined to admit of no interloper\r\nin this branch of business; and that he did not at all doubt but that\r\nthey would find matter enough to shop the evidence himself before the\r\nnext gaol-delivery. He affirmed, that all these circumstances were well\r\nknown to the justice; and that his severity to Clinker was no other\r\nthan a hint to his master to make him a present in private, as an\r\nacknowledgment of his candour and humanity.\r\n\r\nThis hint, however, was so unpalatable to Mr Bramble, that he declared,\r\nwith great warmth, he would rather confine himself for life to\r\nLondon, which he detested, than be at liberty to leave it tomorrow, in\r\nconsequence of encouraging corruption in a magistrate. Hearing, however,\r\nhow favourable Mr Mead’s report had been for the prisoner, he is\r\nresolved to take the advice of counsel in what manner to proceed for his\r\nimmediate enlargement. I make no doubt, but that in a day or two this\r\ntroublesome business may be discussed; and in this hope we are preparing\r\nfor our journey. If our endeavours do not miscarry, we shall have taken\r\nthe field before you hear again from\r\n\r\nYours, J. MELFORD LONDON, June 11\r\n\nTo Dr LEWIS.\r\n\r\nThank Heaven! dear Lewis, the clouds are dispersed, and I have now the\r\nclearest prospect of my summer campaign, which, I hope, I shall be able\r\nto begin to-morrow. I took the advice of counsel with respect to the\r\ncase of Clinker, in whose favour a lucky incident has intervened.\r\nThe fellow who accused him, has had his own battery turned upon\r\nhimself.--Two days ago he was apprehended for a robbery on the highway,\r\nand committed, on the evidence of an accomplice. Clinker, having moved\r\nfor a writ of habeas corpus, was brought before the lord chief justice,\r\nwho, in consequence of an affidavit of the gentleman who had been\r\nrobbed, importing that the said Clinker was not the person who stopped\r\nhim on the highway, as well as in consideration of the postilion’s\r\ncharacter and present circumstances, was pleased to order, that\r\nmy servant should be admitted to bail, and he has been discharged\r\naccordingly, to the unspeakable satisfaction of our whole family, to\r\nwhich he has recommended himself in an extraordinary manner, not only by\r\nhis obliging deportment, but by his talents of preaching, praying, and\r\nsinging psalms, which he has exercised with such effect, that even Tabby\r\nrespects him as a chosen vessel. If there was any thing like affectation\r\nor hypocrisy in this excess of religion, I would not keep him in\r\nmy service, but, so far as I can observe, the fellow’s character is\r\ndownright simplicity, warmed with a kind of enthusiasm, which renders\r\nhim very susceptible of gratitude and attachment to his benefactors.\r\n\r\nAs he is an excellent horseman, and understands farriery, I have bought\r\na stout gelding for his use, that he may attend us on the road, and have\r\nan eye to our cattle, in case the coachman should not mind his business.\r\nMy nephew, who is to ride his own saddle-horse, has taken, upon trial,\r\na servant just come from abroad with his former master, Sir William\r\nStrollop, who vouches for his honesty. The fellow, whose name is Dutton,\r\nseems to be a petit maitre.--He has got a smattering of French, bows,\r\nand grins, and shrugs, and takes snuff a la mode de France, but values\r\nhimself chiefly upon his skill and dexterity in hair-dressing.--If I\r\nam not much deceived by appearance, he is, in all respects, the very\r\ncontrast of Humphry Clinker.\r\n\r\nMy sister has made up matters with lady Griskin; though, I must own, I\r\nshould not have been sorry to see that connexion entirely destroyed: but\r\nTabby is not of a disposition to forgive Barton, who, I understand,\r\nis gone to his seat in Berkshire for the summer season. I cannot help\r\nsuspecting, that in the treaty of peace, which has been lately ratified\r\nbetwixt those two females, it is stipulated, that her ladyship shall\r\nuse her best endeavours to provide an agreeable help-mate for our sister\r\nTabitha, who seems to be quite desperate in her matrimonial designs.\r\nPerhaps, the match-maker is to have a valuable consideration in the way\r\nof brokerage, which she will most certainly deserve, if she can find\r\nany man in his senses, who will yoke with Mrs Bramble from motives of\r\naffection or interest.\r\n\r\nI find my spirits and my health affect each other reciprocally that is\r\nto say, every thing that discomposes my mind, produces a correspondent\r\ndisorder in my body; and my bodily complaints are remarkably\r\nmitigated by those considerations that dissipate the clouds of mental\r\nchagrin.--The imprisonment of Clinker brought on those symptoms which\r\nI mentioned in my last, and now they are vanished at his discharge.--It\r\nmust be owned, indeed, I took some of the tincture of ginseng, prepared\r\naccording to your prescription, and found it exceedingly grateful to\r\nthe stomach; but the pain and sickness continued to return, after short\r\nintervals, till the anxiety of my mind was entirely removed, and then I\r\nfound myself perfectly at ease. We have had fair weather these ten days,\r\nto the astonishment of the Londoners, who think it portentous. If you\r\nenjoy the same indulgence in Wales, I hope Barns has got my hay made,\r\nand safe cocked by this time. As we shall be in motion for some weeks,\r\nI cannot expect to hear from you as usual; but I shall continue to write\r\nfrom every place at which we make any halt, that you may know our track,\r\nin case it should be necessary to communicate any thing to\r\n\r\nYour assured friend, MATT. BRAMBLE LONDON, June 14.\r\n\nTo Mrs MARY JONES, at Brambleton-hall, &c.\r\n\r\nDEAR MARY,\r\n\r\nHaving the occasion of my cousin Jenkins of Aberga’ny, I send you, as\r\na token, a turkey-shell comb, a kiple of yards of green ribbon, and a\r\nsarment upon the nothingness of good works, which was preached in the\r\nTabernacle; and you will also receive a horn-buck for Saul, whereby she\r\nmay learn her letters; for Fin much consarned about the state of her\r\npoor sole--and what are all the pursuits of this life to the consarns of\r\nthat immortal part?--What is life but a veil of affliction? O Mary! the\r\nwhole family have been in such a constipation!--Mr Clinker has been in\r\ntrouble, but the gates of hell have not been able to prevail again him.\r\nHis virtue is like poor gould, seven times tried in the fire. He was\r\ntuck up for a rubbery, and had before gustass Busshard, who made his\r\nmittamouse; and the pore youth was sent to prison upon the false oaf of\r\na willian, that wanted to sware his life away for the looker of cain.\r\n\r\nThe ‘squire did all in his power, but could not prevent his being put\r\nin chains, and confined among common manufactors, where he stood like\r\nan innocent sheep in the midst of wolves and tygers.--Lord knows what\r\nmought have happened to this pyehouse young man, if master had not\r\napplied to Apias Korkus, who lives with the ould bailiff, and is, they\r\nsay, five hundred years old (God bless us!), and a congeror: but, if he\r\nbe, sure I am he don’t deal with the devil, otherwise he couldn’t have\r\nfought out Mr Clinker, as he did, in spite of stone walls, iron bolts,\r\nand double locks, that flew open at his command; for ould Scratch has\r\nnot a greater enemy upon hearth than Mr Clinker, who is, indeed, a very\r\npowerful labourer in the Lord’s vineyard. I do no more than yuse the\r\nwords of my good lady, who has got the infectual calling; and, I\r\ntrust, that even myself, though unworthy, shall find grease to be\r\nexcepted.--Miss Liddy has been touch’d to the quick, but is a little\r\ntimorsome: howsomever, I make no doubt, but she, and all of us, will be\r\nbrought, by the endeavours of Mr Clinker, to produce blessed fruit of\r\ngeneration and repentance.--As for master and the young ‘squire, they\r\nhave as yet had narro glimpse of the new light.--I doubt as how their\r\nharts are hardened by worldly wisdom, which, as the pyebill saith, is\r\nfoolishness in the sight of God.\r\n\r\nO Mary Jones, pray without seizing for grease to prepare you for\r\nthe operations of this wonderful instrument, which, I hope, will\r\nbe exorcised this winter upon you and others at Brambleton-hall.--\r\nTomorrow, we are to set out in a cox and four for Yorkshire; and, I\r\nbelieve, we shall travel that way far, and far, and farther than I can\r\ntell; but I shan’t go so far as to forget my friends; and Mary Jones\r\nwill always be remembered as one of them by her\r\n\nHumble sarvant, WIN. JENKINS LONDON, June 14.\r\n\nTo Mrs GWYLLIM, house-keeper at Brambleton-hall. MRS GWYLLIM,\r\n\r\nI can’t help thinking it very strange, that I never had an answer to the\r\nletter I wrote you some weeks ago from Bath, concerning the sour bear,\r\nthe gander, and the maids eating butter, which I won’t allow to be\r\nwasted.--We are now going upon a long journey to the north, whereby I\r\ndesire you will redouble your care and circumflexion, that the family\r\nmay be well managed in our absence; for, you know, you must render\r\naccount, not only to your earthly master, but also to him that is above;\r\nand if you are found a good and faithful sarvant, great will be your\r\nreward in haven. I hope there will be twenty stun of cheese ready for\r\nmarket--by the time I get huom, and as much owl spun, as will make half\r\na dozen pair of blankets; and that the savings of the butter-milk will\r\nfetch me a good penny before Martinmass, as the two pigs are to be fed\r\nfor baking with bitchmast and acrons.\r\n\r\nI wrote to doctor Lews for the same porpuss, but he never had the good\r\nmanners to take the least notice of my letter; for which reason, I shall\r\nnever favour him with another, though he beshits me on his bended knees.\r\nYou will do well to keep a watchful eye over the hind Villiams, who is\r\none of his amissories, and, I believe, no better than he should be at\r\nbottom. God forbid that I should lack christian charity; but charity\r\nbegins at huom, and sure nothing can be a more charitable work than to\r\nrid the family of such vermine. I do suppose, that the bindled cow has\r\nbeen had to the parson’s bull, that old Moll has had another litter of\r\npigs, and that Dick is become a mighty mouser. Pray order every thing\r\nfor the best, and be frugal, and keep the maids to their labour--If I\r\nhad a private opportunity, I would send them some hymns to sing instead\r\nof profane ballads; but, as I can’t, they and you must be contented with\r\nthe prayers of\r\n\nYour assured friend, T. BRAMBLE LONDON, June 14.\r\n\nTo Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bart. of Jesus college, Oxon.\r\n\r\nDEAR PHILLIPS,\r\n\r\nThe very day after I wrote my last, Clinker was set at liberty. As\r\nMartin had foretold, the accuser was himself committed for a robbery,\r\nupon unquestionable evidence. He had been for some time in the snares of\r\nthe thief-taking society; who, resenting his presumption in attempting\r\nto incroach upon their monopoly of impeachment, had him taken up and\r\ncommitted to Newgate, on the deposition of an accomplice, who has been\r\nadmitted as evidence for the king. The postilion being upon record as an\r\nold offender, the chief justice made no scruple of admitting Clinker to\r\nbail, when he perused the affidavit of Mr Mead, importing that the said\r\nClinker was not the person that robbed him on Blackheath; and honest\r\nHumphry was discharged. When he came home, he expressed great eagerness\r\nto pay his respects to his master, and here his elocution failed him,\r\nbut his silence was pathetic; he fell down at his feet and embraced his\r\nknees, shedding a flood of tears, which my uncle did not see without\r\nemotion. He took snuff in some confusion; and, putting his hand in\r\nhis pocket, gave him his blessing in something more substantial than\r\nwords--‘Clinker (said he), I am so well convinced, both of your honesty\r\nand courage, that I am resolved to make you my life-guardman on the\r\nhighway.’\r\n\r\nHe was accordingly provided with a case of pistols, and a carbine to be\r\nflung a-cross his shoulders; and every other preparation being made, we\r\nset out last Thursday, at seven in the morning; my uncle, with the three\r\nwomen in the coach; Humphry, well mounted on a black gelding bought for\r\nhis use; myself a-horseback, attended by my new valet, Mr Dutton,\r\nan exceeding coxcomb, fresh from his travels, whom I have taken upon\r\ntrial--The fellow wears a solitaire, uses paint, and takes rappee with\r\nall the grimace of a French marquis. At present, however, he is in a\r\nridingdress, jack-boots, leather breeches, a scarlet waistcoat, with\r\ngold binding, a laced hat, a hanger, a French posting-whip in his hand,\r\nand his hair en queue.\r\n\r\nBefore we had gone nine miles, my horse lost one of his shoes; so that I\r\nwas obliged to stop at Barnet to have another, while the coach proceeded\r\nat an easy pace over the common. About a mile short of Hatfield, the\r\npostilions, stopping the carriage, gave notice to Clinker that there\r\nwere two suspicious fellows a-horseback, at the end of a lane, who\r\nsemed waiting to attack the coach. Humphry forthwith apprised my uncle,\r\ndeclaring he would stand by him to the last drop of his blood; and\r\nunflinging his carbine, prepared for action. The ‘squire had pistols in\r\nthe pockets of the coach, and resolved to make use of them directly;\r\nbut he was effectually prevented by his female companions, who flung\r\nthemselves about his neck, and screamed in concert--At that instant,\r\nwho should come up at a hand-gallop, but Martin, the highway-man, who,\r\nadvancing to the coach, begged the ladies would compose themselves for\r\na moment then, desiring Clinker to follow him to the charge, he pulled a\r\npistol out of his bosom, and they rode up together to give battle to the\r\nrogues, who, having fired at a great distance, fled across the common.\r\nThey were in pursuit of the fugitives when I came up, not a little\r\nalarmed at the shrieks in the coach, where I found my uncle in a violent\r\nrage, without his periwig, struggling to disentangle himself from Tabby\r\nand the other two, and swearing with great vociferation. Before I had\r\ntime to interpose, Martin and Clinker returned from the pursuit, and\r\nthe former payed his compliments with great politeness, giving us to\r\nunderstand, that the fellows had scampered off, and that he believed\r\nthey were a couple of raw ‘prentices from London. He commended Clinker\r\nfor his courage, and said, if we would give him leave, he would have the\r\nhonour to accompany us as far as Stevenage, where he had some business.\r\n\r\nThe ‘squire, having recollected and adjusted himself, was the first\r\nto laugh at his own situation: but it was not without difficulty, that\r\nTabby’s arms could be untwisted from his neck; Liddy’s teeth chattered,\r\nand Jenkins was threatened with a fit as usual. I had communicated to my\r\nuncle the character of Martin, as it was described by the constable, and\r\nhe was much struck with its singularity--He could not suppose the fellow\r\nhad any design on our company, which was so numerous and well armed; he\r\ntherefore thanked him, for the service he had just done them, said he\r\nwould be glad of his company, and asked him to dine with us at Hatfield.\r\nThis invitation might not have been agreeable to the ladies, had they\r\nknown the real profession of our guest, but this was a secret to all,\r\nexcept my uncle and myself. Mrs Tabitha, however, would by no means\r\nconsent to proceed with a case of loaded pistols in the coach, and they\r\nwere forthwith discharged in complaisance to her and the rest of the\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nBeing gratified in this particular, she became remarkably goodhumoured,\r\nand at dinner behaved in the most affable manner to Mr Martin, with\r\nwhose polite address and agreeable conversation she seemed to be much\r\ntaken. After dinner, the landlord accosting me in the yard, asked with a\r\nsignificant look, if the gentleman that rode the sorrel belonged to our\r\ncompany?--I understand his meaning, but answered no; that he had come\r\nup with us on the common, and helped us to drive away two fellows, that\r\nlooked like highwaymen--He nodded three times distinctly, as much as to\r\nsay, he knows his cue. Then he inquired, if one of those men was mounted\r\non a bay mare, and the other on a chestnut gelding with a white streak\r\ndown his forehead? and being answered in the affirmative, he assured me\r\nthey had robbed three post-chaises this very morning--I inquired, in my\r\nturn, if Mr Martin was of his acquaintance; and, nodding thrice again,\r\nhe answered, that he had seen the gentleman.\r\n\r\nBefore we left Hatfield, my uncle, fixing his eyes on Martin with such\r\nexpression as is more easily conceived than described, asked, if he\r\noften travelled that road? and he replied with a look which denoted his\r\nunderstanding the question, that he very seldom did business in that\r\npart of the country. In a word, this adventurer favoured us with his\r\ncompany to the neighbourhood of Stevenage, where he took his leave of\r\nthe coach and me, in very polite terms, and turned off upon a crossroad,\r\nthat led to a village on the left--At supper, Mrs Tabby was very full\r\nin the praise of Mr Martin’s good-sense and good-breeding, and seemed\r\nto regret that she had not a further opportunity to make some experiment\r\nupon his affection. In the morning, my uncle was not a little surprised\r\nto receive, from the waiter a billet couched in these words--\r\n\n‘SIR,\r\n\r\nI could easily perceive from your looks, when I had the honour to\r\nconverse with you at Hatfield, that my character is not unknown to you;\r\nand, I dare say you won’t think it strange, that I should be glad to\r\nchange my present way of life, for any other honest occupation, let it\r\nbe ever so humble, that will afford me bread in moderation, and sleep\r\nin safety--Perhaps you may think I flatter, when I say, that from the\r\nmoment I was witness to your generous concern in the cause of your\r\nservant, I conceived a particular esteem and veneration for your person;\r\nand yet what I say is true. I should think myself happy, if I could\r\nbe admitted into your protection and service, as house-steward, clerk,\r\nbutler, or bailiff, for either of which places I think myself tolerably\r\nwell qualified; and, sure I am, I should not be found deficient in\r\ngratitude and fidelity--At the same time, I am very sensible how much\r\nyou must deviate from the common maxims of discretion, even in putting\r\nmy professions to the trial; but I don’t look upon you as a person that\r\nthinks in the ordinary stile; and the delicacy of my situation, will,\r\nI know, justify this address to a heart warmed with beneficence and\r\ncompassion--Understanding you are going pretty far north, I shall take\r\nan opportunity to throw myself in your way again, before you reach the\r\nborders of Scotland; and, I hope, by that time, you will have taken into\r\nconsideration, the truly distressful case of,\r\n\r\nhonoured sir, your very humble, and devoted servant, EDWARD MARTIN’\r\n\r\nThe ‘squire, having perused this letter, put it into my hand, without\r\nsaying a syllable; and when I had read it we looked at each other in\r\nsilence. From a certain sparkling in his eyes, I discovered there was\r\nmore in his heart, than he cared to express with his tongue, in favour\r\nof poor Martin; and this was precisely my own feeling, which he did not\r\nfail to discern, by the same means of communication--‘What shall we\r\ndo (said he) to save this poor sinner from the gallows, and make him\r\na useful member of the commonwealth; and yet the proverb says, Save a\r\nthief from the gallows, and he’ll cut your throat.’ I told him I really\r\nbelieved Martin was capable of giving the proverb the lie; and that\r\nI should heartily concur in any step he might take in favour of his\r\nsolicitation. We mutually resolved to deliberate upon the subject,\r\nand, in the mean time, proceeded on our journey. The roads, having been\r\nbroken up by the heavy rains in the spring, were so rough, that although\r\nwe travelled very slowly, the jolting occasioned such pain, to my uncle,\r\nthat he was become exceedingly peevish when we arrived at this place,\r\nwhich lies about eight miles from the postroad, between Wetherby and\r\nBoroughbridge.\r\n\r\nHarrigate-water, so celebrated for its efficacy in the scurvy and other\r\ndistempers, is supplied from a copious spring, in the hollow of a\r\nwild common, round which, a good many houses have been built for the\r\nconvenience of the drinkers, though few of them are inhabited. Most of\r\nthe company lodge at some distance, in five separate inns, situated in\r\ndifferent parts of the commons, from whence they go every morning to the\r\nwell, in their own carriages. The lodgers of each inn form a distinct\r\nsociety, that eat together; and there is a commodious public room, where\r\nthey breakfast in disabille, at separate tables, from eight o’clock till\r\neleven, as they chance or chuse to come in--Here also they drink tea in\r\nthe afternoon, and play at cards or dance in the evening. One custom,\r\nhowever, prevails, which I looked upon as a solecism in politeness. The\r\nladies treat with tea in their turns; and even girls of sixteen are\r\nnot exempted from this shameful imposition--There is a public ball by\r\nsubscription every night at one of the houses, to which all the company\r\nfrom the others are admitted by tickets; and, indeed, Harrigate treads\r\nupon the heels of Bath, in the articles of gaiety and dissipation--with\r\nthis difference, however, that here we are more sociable and familiar.\r\nOne of the inns is already full up to the very garrets, having no less\r\nthan fifty lodgers, and as many servants. Our family does not exceed\r\nthirty-six; and I should be sorry to see the number augmented, as our\r\naccommodations won’t admit of much increase.\r\n\r\nAt present, the company is more agreeable than one could expect from\r\nan accidental assemblage of persons, who are utter strangers to one\r\nanother--There seems to be a general disposition among us to maintain\r\ngood-fellowship, and promote the purposes of humanity, in favour of\r\nthose who come hither on the score of health. I see several faces which\r\nwe left at Bath, although the majority are of the Northern counties,\r\nand many come from Scotland for the benefit of these waters--In such a\r\nvariety, there must be some originals, among whom Mrs Tabitha Bramble is\r\nnot the most inconsiderable--No place where there is such an intercourse\r\nbetween the sexes, can be disagreeable to a lady of her views and\r\ntemperament--She has had some warm disputes at table, with a lame parson\r\nfrom Northumberland, on the new birth, and the insignificance of moral\r\nvirtue; and her arguments have been reinforced by an old Scotch lawyer,\r\nin a rye periwig, who, though he has lost his teeth, and the use of his\r\nlimbs, can still wag his tongue with great volubility. He has paid her\r\nsuch fulsome compliments, upon her piety and learning, as seem to have\r\nwon her heart; and she, in her turn, treats him with such attention as\r\nindicates a design upon his person; but, by all accounts, he is too\r\nmuch of a fox to be inveigled into any snare that she can lay for his\r\naffection.\r\n\r\nWe do not propose to stay long at Harrigate, though, at present, it is\r\nour headquarters, from whence we shall make some excursions, to\r\nvisit two or three of our rich relations, who are settled in this\r\ncountry.--Pray, remember me to all our friends of Jesus, and allow me to\r\nbe still\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, J. MELFORD HARRIGATE, June 23.\r\n\nTo Dr LEWIS.\r\n\r\nDEAR DOCTOR,\r\n\r\nConsidering the tax we pay for turnpikes, the roads of this county\r\nconstitute a most intolerable grievance. Between Newark and Weatherby,\r\nI have suffered more from jolting and swinging than ever I felt in the\r\nwhole course of my life, although the carriage is remarkably commodious\r\nand well hung, and the postilions were very careful in driving. I am now\r\nsafely housed at the New Inn, at Harrigate, whither I came to satisfy\r\nmy curiosity, rather than with any view of advantage to my health; and,\r\ntruly, after having considered all the parts and particulars of the\r\nplace, I cannot account for the concourse of people one finds here, upon\r\nany other principle but that of caprice, which seems to be the character\r\nof our nation.\r\n\r\nHarrigate is a wild common, bare and bleak, without tree or shrub, or\r\nthe least signs of cultivation; and the people who come to drink the\r\nwater, are crowded together in paltry inns, where the few tolerable\r\nrooms are monopolized by the friends and favourites of the house, and\r\nall the rest of the lodgers are obliged to put up with dirty holes,\r\nwhere there is neither space, air, nor convenience. My apartment is\r\nabout ten feet square; and when the folding bed is down, there is just\r\nroom sufficient to pass between it and the fire. One might expect,\r\nindeed, that there would be no occasion for a fire at Midsummer; but\r\nhere the climate is so backward, that an ash tree, which our landlord\r\nhas planted before my window, is just beginning to put forth its leaves;\r\nand I am fain to have my bed warmed every night.\r\n\r\nAs for the water, which is said to have effected so many surprising\r\ncures, I have drank it once, and the first draught has cured me of all\r\ndesire to repeat the medicine.--Some people say it smells of rotten\r\neggs, and others compare it to the scourings of a foul gun.--It is\r\ngenerally supposed to be strongly impregnated with sulphur; and Dr Shaw,\r\nin his book upon mineral water, says, he has seen flakes of sulphur\r\nfloating in the well--Pace tanti viri; I, for my part, have never\r\nobserved any thing like sulphur, either in or about the well, neither do\r\nI find that any brimstone has ever been extracted from the water. As\r\nfor the smell, if I may be allowed to judge from my own organs, it is\r\nexactly that of bilge-water; and the saline taste of it seems to declare\r\nthat it is nothing else than salt water putrified in the bowels of the\r\nearth. I was obliged to hold my nose with one hand, while I advanced the\r\nglass to my mouth with the other; and after I had made shift to swallow\r\nit, my stomach could hardly retain what it had received.--The only\r\neffects it produced were sickness, griping, and insurmountable\r\ndisgust.--I can hardly mention it without puking.--The world is\r\nstrangely misled by the affectation of singularity. I cannot help\r\nsuspecting, that this water owes its reputation in a great measure\r\nto its being so strikingly offensive.--On the same kind of analogy, a\r\nGerman doctor has introduced hemlock and other poisons, as specifics,\r\ninto the materia medica.--I am persuaded, that all the cures ascribed\r\nto the Harrigate water, would have been as efficaciously, and infinitely\r\nmore agreeably performed, by the internal and external use of seawater.\r\nSure I am, this last is much less nauseous to the taste and smell, and\r\nmuch more gentle in its operation as a purge, as well as more extensive\r\nin its medical qualities.\r\n\r\nTwo days ago we went across the country to visit ‘squire Burdock, who\r\nmarried a first cousin of my father, an heiress, who brought him an\r\nestate of a thousand a-year. This gentleman is a declared opponent\r\nof the ministry in parliament; and having an opulent fortune, piques\r\nhimself upon living in the country, and maintaining old English\r\nhospitality--By the bye, this is a phrase very much used by the English\r\nthemselves both in words and writing; but I never heard of it out of the\r\nisland, except by way of irony and sarcasm. What the hospitality of our\r\nforefathers has been I should be glad to see recorded, rather in the\r\nmemoirs of strangers who have visited our country, and were the proper\r\nobjects and judges of such hospitality, than in the discourse and\r\nlucubrations of the modern English, who seem to describe it from\r\ntheory and conjecture. Certain it is, we are generally looked upon by\r\nforeigners, as a people totally destitute of this virtue; and I\r\nnever was in any country abroad, where I did not meet with persons of\r\ndistinction, who complained of having been inhospitably used in Great\r\nBritain. A gentleman of France, Italy, or Germany, who has entertained\r\nand lodged an Englishman at his house, when he afterwards meets with\r\nhis guest at London, is asked to dinner at the Saracen’s-head, the\r\nTurk’s-head, the Boar’s-head, or the Bear, eats raw beef and butter,\r\ndrinks execrable port, and is allowed to pay his share of the reckoning.\r\n\r\nBut to return from this digression, which my feeling for the honour of\r\nmy country obliged me to make--our Yorkshire cousin has been a mighty\r\nfox-hunter before the Lord; but now he is too fat and unwieldy to leap\r\nditches and five-bar gates; nevertheless, he still keeps a pack\r\nof hounds, which are well exercised; and his huntsman every night\r\nentertains him with the adventures of the day’s chace, which he recites\r\nin a tone and terms that are extremely curious and significant. In the\r\nmean time, his broad brawn is scratched by one of his grooms.--This\r\nfellow, it seems, having no inclination to curry any beast out of the\r\nstable, was at great pains to scollop his nails in such a manner that\r\nthe blood followed at every stroke.--He was in hopes that he would\r\nbe dismissed from this disagreeable office, but the event turned out\r\ncontrary to his expectation.--His master declared he was the best\r\nscratcher in the family; and now he will not suffer any other servant to\r\ndraw a nail upon his carcase.\r\n\r\nThe ‘squire’s lady is very proud, without being stiff or inaccessible.\r\nShe receives even her inferiors in point of fortune with a kind of\r\narrogant civility; but then she thinks she has a right to treat them\r\nwith the most ungracious freedoms of speech, and never fails to let\r\nthem know she is sensible of her own superior affluence. In a word,\r\nshe speaks well of no living soul, and has not one single friend in\r\nthe world. Her husband hates her mortally; but, although the brute is\r\nsometimes so very powerful in him that he will have his own way, he\r\ngenerally truckles to her dominion, and dreads, like a school-boy, the\r\nlash of her tongue. On the other hand, she is afraid of provoking him\r\ntoo far, lest he should make some desperate effort to shake off her\r\nyoke.--She, therefore, acquiesces in the proofs he daily gives of his\r\nattachment to the liberty of an English freeholder, by saying and doing,\r\nat his own table, whatever gratifies the brutality of his disposition,\r\nor contributes to the ease of his person. The house, though large, is\r\nneither elegant nor comfortable.--It looks like a great inn, crowded\r\nwith travellers, who dine at the landlord’s ordinary, where there is\r\na great profusion of victuals and drink, but mine host seems to be\r\nmisplaced; and I would rather dine upon filberts with a hermit, than\r\nfeed upon venison with a hog. The footmen might be aptly compared to the\r\nwaiters of a tavern, if they were more serviceable and less rapacious;\r\nbut they are generally insolent and inattentive, and so greedy, that, I\r\nthink, I can dine better, and for less expence, at the Star and Garter\r\nin Pall mall, than at our cousin’s castle in Yorkshire. The ‘squire is\r\nnot only accommodated with a wife, but he is also blessed with an only\r\nson, about two and twenty, just returned from Italy, a complete fidler\r\nand dillettante; and he slips no opportunity of manifesting the most\r\nperfect contempt for his own father.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived, there was a family of foreigners at the house, on a\r\nvisit to this virtuoso, with whom they had been acquainted at the Spa;\r\nit was the count de Melville, with his lady, on their way to Scotland.\r\nMr Burdock had met with an accident, in consequence of which both the\r\ncount and I would have retired but the young gentleman and his mother\r\ninsisted upon our staying dinner; and their serenity seemed to be\r\nso little ruffled by what had happened, that we complied with their\r\ninvitation. The ‘squire had been brought home over night in his\r\npost-chaise, so terribly belaboured about the pate, that he seemed to\r\nbe in a state of stupefaction, and had ever since remained speechless. A\r\ncountry apothecary, called Grieve, who lived in a neighbouring village,\r\nhaving been called to his assistance, had let him blood, and applied a\r\npoultice to his head, declaring, that he had no fever, nor any other bad\r\nsymptom but the loss of speech, if he really had lost that faculty.\r\nBut the young ‘squire said this practitioner was an ignorantaccio, that\r\nthere was a fracture in the cranium, and that there was a necessity for\r\nhaving him trepanned without loss of time. His mother, espousing this\r\nopinion, had sent an express to York for a surgeon to perform the\r\noperation, and he was already come with his ‘prentice and instruments.\r\nHaving examined the patient’s head, he began to prepare his dressings;\r\nthough Grieve still retained his first opinion that there was no\r\nfracture, and was the more confirmed in it as the ‘squire had passed the\r\nnight in profound sleep, uninterrupted by any catching or convulsion.\r\nThe York surgeon said he could not tell whether there was a fracture,\r\nuntil he should take off the scalp; but, at any rate, the operation\r\nmight be of service in giving vent to any blood that might be\r\nextravasated, either above or below the dura mater. The lady and her son\r\nwere clear for trying the experiment; and Grieve was dismissed with\r\nsome marks of contempt, which, perhaps, he owed to the plainness of his\r\nappearance. He seemed to be about the middle age, wore his own black\r\nhair without any sort of dressing; by his garb, one would have taken\r\nhim for a quaker, but he had none of the stiffness of that sect, on the\r\ncontrary he was very submissive, respectful, and remarkably taciturn.\r\n\r\nLeaving the ladies in an apartment by themselves, we adjourned to the\r\npatient’s chamber, where the dressings and instruments were displayed\r\nin order upon a pewter dish. The operator, laying aside his coat and\r\nperiwig, equipped himself with a night-cap, apron, and sleeves, while\r\nhis ‘prentice and footman, seizing the ‘squire’s head, began to place\r\nit in a proper posture.--But mark what followed.--The patient, bolting\r\nupright in the bed, collared each of these assistants with the grasp of\r\nHercules, exclaiming, in a bellowing tone, ‘I ha’n’t lived so long in\r\nYorkshire to be trepanned by such vermin as you;’ and leaping on the\r\nfloor, put on his breeches quietly, to the astonishment of us all. The\r\nSurgeon still insisted upon the operation, alleging it was now plain\r\nthat the brain was injured, and desiring the servants put him into\r\nbed again; but nobody would venture to execute his orders, or even to\r\ninterpose: when the ‘squire turned him and his assistants out of doors,\r\nand threw his apparatus out at the window. Having thus asserted his\r\nprerogative, and put on his cloaths with the help of a valet, the count,\r\nwith my nephew and me, were introduced by his son, and received with his\r\nusual stile of rustic civility; then turning to signor Macaroni, with a\r\nsarcastic grin, ‘I tell thee what, Dick (said he), a man’s scull is not\r\nto be bored every time his head is broken; and I’ll convince thee and\r\nthy mother, that I know as many tricks as e’er an old fox in the West\r\nRiding.’\r\n\r\nWe afterwards understood he had quarrelled at a public house with an\r\nexciseman, whom he challenged to a bout at single stick, in which he had\r\nbeen worsted; and that the shame of this defeat had tied up his tongue.\r\nAs for madam, she had shewn no concern for his disaster, and now heard\r\nof his recovery without emotion--She had taken some little notice of\r\nmy sister and niece, though rather with a view to indulge her own\r\npetulance, than out of any sentiment of regard to our family.--She said\r\nLiddy was a fright, and ordered her woman to adjust her head before\r\ndinner; but she would not meddle with Tabby, whose spirit, she soon\r\nperceived, was not to be irritated with impunity. At table, she\r\nacknowledged me so far as to say she had heard of my father; though\r\nshe hinted, that he had disobliged her family by making a poor match\r\nin Wales. She was disagreeably familiar in her enquiries about our\r\ncircumstances; and asked, if I intended to bring up my nephew to the\r\nlaw. I told her, that, as he had an independent fortune, he should\r\nfollow no profession but that of a country gentleman; and that I was not\r\nwithout hopes of procuring for him a seat in parliament--‘Pray cousin\r\n(said she), what may his fortune be?’ When I answered, that, with what\r\nI should be able to give him, he would have better than two thousand a\r\nyear, she replied, with a disdainful toss of her head, that it would\r\nbe impossible for him to preserve his independence on such a paultry\r\nprovision.\r\n\r\nNot a little nettled at this arrogant remark, I told her, I had the\r\nhonour to sit in parliament with her father, when he had little more\r\nthan half that income; and I believed there was not a more independent\r\nand incorruptible member in the house. ‘Ay; but times are changed (cried\r\nthe ‘squire)--Country gentlemen now-a-days live after another fashion.\r\nMy table alone stands me in a cool thousand a quarter, though I raise\r\nmy own stock, import my own liquors, and have every thing at the first\r\nhand.--True it is, I keep open house, and receive all comers, for the\r\nhonour of Old England.’ ‘If that be the case (said I), ‘tis a wonder you\r\ncan maintain it at so small an expence; but every private gentleman is\r\nnot expected to keep a caravanserai for the accommodation of travellers:\r\nindeed, if every individual lived in the same stile, you would not have\r\nsuch a number of guests at your table, of consequence your hospitality\r\nwould not shine so bright for the glory of the West Riding.’ The\r\nyoung ‘squire, tickled by this ironical observation, exclaimed, ‘O che\r\nburla!’--his mother eyed me in silence with a supercilious air; and\r\nthe father of the feast, taking a bumper of October, ‘My service to you,\r\ncousin Bramble (said he), I have always heard there was something keen\r\nand biting in the air of the Welch mountains.’\r\n\r\nI was much pleased with the count de Melville, who is sensible, easy,\r\nand polite; and the countess is the most amiable woman I ever beheld.\r\nIn the afternoon they took leave of their entertainers, and the young\r\ngentleman, mounting his horse, undertook to conduct their coach through\r\nthe park, while one of their servants rode round to give notice to the\r\nrest, whom they had left at a public house on the road. The moment\r\ntheir backs were turned, the censorious daemon took possession of our\r\nYorkshire landlady and our sister Tabitha--The former observed, that\r\nthe countess was a good sort of a body, but totally ignorant of good\r\nbreeding, consequently aukward in her address. The squire said, he did\r\nnot pretend to the breeding of any thing but colts; but that the jade\r\nwould be very handsome, if she was a little more in flesh. ‘Handsome!\r\n(cried Tabby) she has indeed a pair of black eyes without any meaning;\r\nbut then there is not a good feature in her face.’ ‘I know not what you\r\ncall good features in Wales (replied our landlord); but they’ll pass in\r\nYorkshire.’ Then turning to Liddy, he added, ‘What say you, my pretty\r\nRedstreak?--what is your opinion of the countess?’ ‘I think (cried\r\nLiddy, with great emotion), she’s an angel.’ Tabby chid her for talking\r\nwith such freedom in company; and the lady of the house said, in a\r\ncontemptuous tone, she supposed miss had been brought up at some country\r\nboarding-school.\r\n\r\nOur conversation was suddenly interrupted by the young gentleman,\r\nwho galloped into the yard all aghast, exclaiming, that the coach was\r\nattacked by a great number of highwaymen. My nephew and I rushed out,\r\nfound his own and his servant’s horse ready saddled in the stable, with\r\npistols in the caps--We mounted instantly, ordering Clinker and Dutton\r\nto follow with all possible expedition; but notwithstanding all the\r\nspeed we could make, the action was over before we arrived, and the\r\ncount with his lady, safe lodged at the house of Grieve, who had\r\nsignalized himself in a very remarkable manner on this occasion. At the\r\nturning of a lane, that led to the village where the count’s servants\r\nremained, a couple of robbers a-horseback suddenly appeared, with their\r\npistols advanced: one kept the coachman in awe, and the other demanded\r\nthe count’s money, while the young ‘squire went off at full speed,\r\nwithout ever casting a look behind. The count desiring the thief to\r\nwithdraw his pistol, as the lady was in great terror, delivered his\r\npurse without making the least resistance; but not satisfied with this\r\nbooty, which was pretty considerable, the rascal insisted upon rifling\r\nher of her car-rings and necklace, and the countess screamed with\r\naffright. Her husband, exasperated at the violence with which she was\r\nthreatened, wrested the pistol out of the fellow’s hand, and turning it\r\nupon him, snapped it in his face; but the robber knowing there was no\r\ncharge in it, drew another from his bosom, and in all probability would\r\nhave killed him on the spot, had not his life been saved by a wonderful\r\ninterposition. Grieve, the apothecary, chancing to pass that very\r\ninstant, ran up to the coach, and with a crab-stick, which was all the\r\nweapon he had, brought the fellow to the ground with the first blow;\r\nthen seizing his pistol, presented it at his colleague, who fired his\r\npiece at random, and fled without further opposition. The other was\r\nsecured by the assistance of the count and the coachman; and his legs\r\nbeing tied under the belly of his own horse, Grieve conducted him to\r\nthe village, whither also the carriage proceeded. It was with great\r\ndifficulty the countess could be kept from swooning; but at last she was\r\nhappily conveyed to the house of the apothecary, who went into the shop\r\nto prepare some drops for her, while his wife and daughter administered\r\nto her in another apartment.\r\n\r\nI found the count standing in the kitchen with the parson of the parish,\r\nand expressing much impatience to see his protector, whom as yet he had\r\nscarce found time to thank for the essential service he had done him\r\nand the countess.--The daughter passing at the same time with a glass of\r\nwater, monsieur de Melville could not help taking notice of her figure,\r\nwhich was strikingly engaging.--‘Ay (said the parson), she is the\r\nprettiest girl, and the best girl in all my parish: and if I could give\r\nmy son an estate of ten thousand a year, he should have my consent to\r\nlay it at her feet. If Mr Grieve had been as solicitious about getting\r\nmoney, as he has been in performing all the duties of a primitive\r\nChristian, he would not have hung so long upon his hands.’ ‘What is her\r\nname?’ said I. ‘Sixteen years ago (answered the vicar) I christened her\r\nby the names of Seraphina Melvilia.’ ‘Ha! what! how! (cried the count\r\neagerly) sure, you said Seraphina Melvilia.’ ‘I did (said he); Mr Grieve\r\ntold me those were the names of two noble persons abroad, to whom he had\r\nbeen obliged for more than life.’\r\n\r\nThe count, without speaking another syllable, rushed into the parlour,\r\ncrying, ‘This is your god-daughter, my dear.’ Mrs Grieve, then seizing\r\nthe countess by the hand, exclaimed with great agitation, ‘O madam! O\r\nsir!--I am--I am your poor Elinor.--This is my Seraphina Melvilia O\r\nchild! these are the count and countess of Melville, the generous the\r\nglorious benefactors of thy once unhappy parents.’\r\n\r\nThe countess rising from her scat threw her arms about the neck of the\r\namiable Seraphina, and clasped her to her breast with great tenderness,\r\nwhile she herself was embraced by the weeping mother. This moving scene\r\nwas completed by the entrance of Grieve himself, who falling on his\r\nknees before the count, ‘Behold (said he) a penitent, who at length\r\ncan look upon his patron without shrinking.’ ‘Ah, Ferdinand! (cried he,\r\nraising and folding him in his arms) the playfellow of my infancy--the\r\ncompanion of my youth!--Is it to you then I am indebted for my\r\nlife?’ ‘Heaven has heard my prayer (said the other), and given me an\r\nopportunity to prove myself not altogether unworthy of your clemency and\r\nprotection.’ He then kissed the hand of the countess, while monsieur\r\nde Melville saluted his wife and lovely daughter, and all of us were\r\ngreatly affected by this pathetic recognition.\r\n\r\nIn a word, Grieve was no other than Ferdinand count Fathom, whose\r\nadventures were printed many years ago. Being a sincere convert to\r\nvirtue, he had changed his name, that he might elude the enquiries of\r\nthe count, whose generous allowance he determined to forego, that he\r\nmight have no dependence but upon his own industry and moderation. He\r\nhad accordingly settled in this village as a practitioner in surgery and\r\nphysic, and for some years wrestled with all the miseries of indigence,\r\nwhich, however, he and his wife had borne with the most exemplary\r\nresignation. At length, by dint of unwearied attention to the duties of\r\nhis profession, which he exercised with equal humanity and success, he\r\nhad acquired tolerable share of business among the farmers and common\r\npeople, which enabled him to live in a decent manner. He had been scarce\r\never seen to smile; was unaffectedly pious; and all the time he could\r\nspare from the avocations of his employment, he spent in educating\r\nhis daughter, and in studying for his own improvement. In short, the\r\nadventurer Fathom was, under the name of Grieve, universally respected\r\namong the commonalty of this district, as a prodigy of learning and\r\nvirtue. These particulars I learned from the vicar, when we quitted the\r\nroom, that they might be under no restraint in their mutual effusions.\r\nI make no doubt that Grieve will be pressed to leave off business,\r\nand re-unite himself to the count’s family; and as the countess seemed\r\nextremely fond of his daughter, she will, in all probability, insist\r\nupon Seraphina’s accompanying her to Scotland.\r\n\r\nHaving paid our compliments to these noble persons, we returned to the\r\n‘squire’s, where we expected an invitation to pass the night, which was\r\nwet and raw; but it seems, ‘squire Burdock’s hospitality reached not so\r\nfar for the honour of Yorkshire; we therefore departed in the evening,\r\nand lay at an inn, where I caught cold.\r\n\r\nIn hope of riding it down before it could take fast hold on my\r\nconstitution, I resolved to visit another relation, one Mr Pimpernel,\r\nwho lived about a dozen miles from the place where we lodged. Pimpernel\r\nbeing the youngest of four sons, was bred an attorney at Furnival’s inn;\r\nbut all his elder brothers dying, he got himself called to the bar for\r\nthe honour of his family, and soon after this preferment, succeeded to\r\nhis father’s estate which was very considerable. He carried home with\r\nhim all the knavish chicanery of the lowest pettifogger, together with\r\na wife whom he had purchased of a drayman for twenty pounds; and he soon\r\nfound means to obtain a dedimus as an acting justice of peace. He is not\r\nonly a sordid miser in his disposition, but his avarice is mingled\r\nwith a spirit of despotism, which is truly diabolical.--He is a brutal\r\nhusband, an unnatural parent, a harsh master, an oppressive landlord, a\r\nlitigious neighbour, and a partial magistrate. Friends he has none;\r\nand in point of hospitality and good breeding, our cousin Burdock is a\r\nprince in comparison of this ungracious miscreant, whose house is the\r\nlively representation of a gaol. Our reception was suitable to the\r\ncharacter I have sketched. Had it depended upon the wife, we should have\r\nbeen kindly treated.--She is really a good sort of a woman, in spite\r\nof her low original, and well respected in the country; but she has not\r\ninterest enough in her own house to command a draught of table beer,\r\nfar less to bestow any kind of education on her children, who run about,\r\nlike tagged colts, in a state of nature.--Pox on him! he is such a dirty\r\nfellow, that I have not patience to prosecute the subject.\r\n\r\nBy that time we reached Harrigate, I began to be visited by certain\r\nrheumatic symptoms. The Scotch lawyer, Mr Micklewhimmen, recommended a\r\nhot bath of these waters so earnestly, that I was over-persuaded to try\r\nthe experiment.--He had used it often with success and always stayed an\r\nhour in the bath, which was a tub filled with Harrigate water, heated\r\nfor the purpose. If I could hardly bear the smell of a single tumbler\r\nwhen cold, you may guess how my nose was regaled by the streams arising\r\nfrom a hot bath of the same fluid. At night, I was conducted into a dark\r\nhole on the ground floor, where the tub smoaked and stunk like the pot\r\nof Acheron, in one corner, and in another stood a dirty bed provided\r\nwith thick blankets, in which I was to sweat after coming out of the\r\nbath. My heart seemed to die within me when I entered this dismal\r\nbagnio, and found my brain assaulted by such insufferable effluvia. I\r\ncursed Micklewhimmen for not considering that my organs were formed on\r\nthis side of the Tweed; but being ashamed to recoil upon the threshold,\r\nI submitted to the process.\r\n\r\nAfter having endured all but real suffocation for above a quarter of an\r\nhour in the tub, I was moved to the bed and wrapped in blankets.--There\r\nI lay a full hour panting with intolerable heat; but not the least\r\nmoisture appearing on my skin, I was carried to my own chamber, and\r\npassed the night without closing an eye, in such a flutter of spirits as\r\nrendered me the most miserable wretch in being. I should certainly\r\nhave run distracted, if the rarefaction of my blood, occasioned by\r\nthat Stygian bath, had not burst the vessels, and produced a violent\r\nhaemorrhage, which, though dreadful and alarming, removed the horrible\r\ndisquiet--I lost two pounds of blood, and more, on this occasion; and\r\nfind myself still weak and languid; but, I believe, a little exercise\r\nwill forward my recovery, and therefore I am resolved to set out\r\nto-morrow for York, in my way to Scarborough, where I propose to brace\r\nup my fibres by sea-bathing, which, I know, is one of your favourite\r\nspecificks. There is, however, one disease, for which you have found as\r\nyet no specific, and that is old age, of which this tedious unconnected\r\nepistle is an infallible symptom: what, therefore, cannot be cured, must\r\nbe endured, by you, as well as by\r\n\r\nYours, MATT. BRAMBLE HARRIGATE, June 26.\r\n\nTo Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bart. of Jesus college, Oxon.\r\n\r\nDEAR KNIGHT,\r\n\r\nThe manner of living at Harrigate was so agreeable to my disposition,\r\nthat I left the place with some regret--Our aunt Tabby would have\r\nprobably made some objection to our departing so soon, had not an\r\naccident embroiled her with Mr Micklewhimmen, the Scotch advocate,\r\non whose heart she had been practising, from the second day after our\r\narrival--That original, though seemingly precluded from the use of\r\nhis limbs, had turned his genius to good account--In short, by dint of\r\ngroaning, and whining, he had excited the compassion of the company so\r\neffectually, that an old lady, who occupied the very best apartment in\r\nthe house, gave it up for his ease and convenience. When his man led him\r\ninto the Long Room, all the females were immediately in commotion--One\r\nset an elbow-chair; another shook up the cushion; a third brought a\r\nstool; and a fourth a pillow, for the accommodation of his feet--\r\nTwo ladies (of whom Tabby was always one) supported him into the\r\ndining-room, and placed him properly at the table; and his taste was\r\nindulged with a succession of delicacies, culled by their fair hands.\r\nAll this attention he repaid with a profusion of compliments and\r\nbenedictions, which were not the less agreeable for being delivered in\r\nthe Scottish dialect. As for Mrs Tabitha, his respects were particularly\r\naddressed to her, and he did not fail to mingle them with religious\r\nreflections, touching free grace, knowing her bias to methodism, which\r\nhe also professed upon a calvinistical model.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I could not help thinking this lawyer was not such an\r\ninvalid as he pretended to be. I observed he ate very heartily three\r\ntimes a day; and though his bottle was marked stomachic tincture, he\r\nhad recourse to it so often, and seemed to swallow it with such peculiar\r\nrelish, that I suspected it was not compounded in the apothecary’s shop,\r\nor the chemist’s laboratory. One day, while he was earnest in discourse\r\nwith Mrs Tabitha, and his servant had gone out on some occasion or\r\nother, I dexterously exchanged the labels, and situation of his bottle\r\nand mine; and having tasted his tincture, found it was excellent claret.\r\nI forthwith handed it about me to some of my neighbours, and it was\r\nquite emptied before Mr Micklewhimmen had occasion to repeat his\r\ndraught. At length, turning about, he took hold of my bottle, instead of\r\nhis own, and, filling a large glass, drank to the health of Mrs Tabitha.\r\nIt had scarce touched his lips, when he perceived the change which had\r\nbeen put upon him, and was at first a little out of countenance. He\r\nseemed to retire within himself, in order to deliberate, and in half a\r\nminute his resolution was taken; addressing himself to our quarter, ‘I\r\ngive the gentleman credit for his wit (said he); it was a gude practical\r\njoke; but sometimes hi joci in seria ducunt mala--I hope for his own\r\nsake he has na drank all the liccor; for it was a vara poorful infusion\r\nof jallap in Bourdeaux wine; at its possable he may ha ta’en sic a dose\r\nas will produce a terrible catastrophe in his ain booels--’\r\n\r\nBy far the greater part of the contents had fallen to the share of a\r\nyoung clothier from Leeds, who had come to make a figure at Harrigate,\r\nand was, in effect a great coxcomb in his way. It was with a view to\r\nlaugh at his fellow-guests, as well as to mortify the lawyer, that he\r\nhad emptied the bottle, when it came to his turn, and he had laughed\r\naccordingly: but now his mirth gave way to his apprehension--He began\r\nto spit, to make wry faces, and writhe himself into various\r\ncontorsions--‘Damn the stuff! (cried he) I thought it had a villainous\r\ntwang--pah! He that would cozen a Scot, mun get oope betimes, and take\r\nOld Scratch for his counsellor--’ ‘In troth mester what d’ye ca’um\r\n(replied the lawyer), your wit has run you into a filthy puddle--I’m\r\ntruly consarned for your waeful case--The best advice I can give you, in\r\nsic a delemma, is to send an express to Rippon for doctor Waugh, without\r\ndelay, and, in the mean time, swallow all the oil and butter you can\r\nfind in the hoose, to defend your poor stomach and intastines from the\r\nvillication of the particles of the jallap, which is vara violent, even\r\nwhen taken in moderation.’\r\n\r\nThe poor clothier’s torments had already begun: he retired, roaring with\r\npain, to his own chamber; the oil was swallowed, and the doctor\r\nsent for; but before he arrived, the miserable patient had made such\r\ndischarges upwards and downwards, that nothing remained to give him\r\nfurther offence; and this double evacuation, was produced by imagination\r\nalone; for what he had drank was genuine wine of Bourdeaux, which the\r\nlawyer had brought from Scotland for his own private use. The clothier,\r\nfinding the joke turn out so expensive and disagreeable, quitted the\r\nhouse next morning, leaving the triumph to Micklewhimmen, who enjoyed it\r\ninternally without any outward signs of exultation--on the contrary, he\r\naffected to pity the young man for what he had suffered; and acquired\r\nfresh credit from this shew of moderation.\r\n\r\nIt was about the middle of the night, which succeeded this adventure,\r\nthat the vent of the kitchen chimney being foul, the soot took fire, and\r\nthe alarm was given in a dreadful manner. Every body leaped naked out\r\nof bed, and in a minute the whole house was filled with cries and\r\nconfusion--There was two stairs in the house, and to these we naturally\r\nran; but they were both so blocked up, by the people pressing one upon\r\nanother, that it seemed impossible to pass, without throwing down\r\nand trampling upon the women. In the midst of this anarchy, Mr\r\nMicklewhimmen, with a leathern portmanteau on his back, came running\r\nas nimble as a buck along the passage; and Tabby in her underpetticoat,\r\nendeavouring to hook him under the arm, that she might escape through\r\nhis protection, he very fairly pushed her down, crying, ‘Na, na, gude\r\nfaith, charity begins at hame!’ Without paying the least respect to the\r\nshrieks and intreaties of his female friends, he charged through the\r\nmidst of the crowd, overturning every thing that opposed him; and\r\nactually fought his way to the bottom of the Stair-case--By this time\r\nClinker had found a ladder by which he entered the window of my uncle’s\r\nchamber, where our family was assembled, and proposed that we should\r\nmake our exit successively by that conveyance. The ‘squire exhorted his\r\nsister to begin the descent; but, before she could resolve, her woman,\r\nMrs Winifred Jenkins, in a transport of terror, threw herself out at the\r\nwindow upon the ladder, while Humphry dropped upon the ground, that\r\nhe might receive her in her descent--This maiden was just as she had\r\nstarted out of bed, the moon shone very bright, and a fresh breeze of\r\nwind blowing, none of Mrs Winifred’s beauties could possibly escape the\r\nview of the fortunate Clinker, whose heart was not able to withstand the\r\nunited force of so many charms; at least I am much mistaken, if he has\r\nnot been her humble slave from that moment--He received her in his arms,\r\nand, giving her his coat to protect her from the weather, ascended again\r\nwith admirable dexterity.\r\n\r\nAt that instant, the landlord of the house called out with an audible\r\nvoice, that the fire was extinguished, and the ladies had nothing\r\nfurther to fear: this was a welcome note to the audience, and produced\r\nan immediate effect; the shrieking ceased, and a confused sound of\r\nexpostulation ensued. I conducted Mrs Tabitha and my sister to their own\r\nchamber, where Liddy fainted away; but was soon brought to herself.\r\nThen I went to offer my services to the other ladies, who might want\r\nassistance--They were all scudding through the passage to their several\r\napartments; and as the thoroughfair was lighted by two lamps, I had a\r\npretty good observation of them in their transit; but as most of them\r\nwere naked to the smock, and all their heads shrowded in huge nightcaps,\r\nI could not distinguish one face from another, though I recognized\r\nsome of their voices--These were generally plaintive; some wept, some\r\nscolded, and some prayed--I lifted up one poor old gentlewoman, who had\r\nbeen overturned and sore bruised by a multitude of feet; and this\r\nwas also the case with the lame person from Northumberland, whom\r\nMicklewhimmen had in his passage overthrown, though not with impunity,\r\nfor the cripple, in falling, gave him such a good pelt on the head with\r\nhis crutch, that the blood followed.\r\n\r\nAs for this lawyer, he waited below till the hurly burly was over, and\r\nthen stole softly to his own chamber, from whence he did not venture to\r\nmake a second sally till eleven in the forenoon, when he was led into\r\nthe Public Room, by his own servant and another assistant, groaning most\r\nwoefully, with a bloody napkin round his head. But things were greatly\r\naltered--The selfish brutality of his behaviour on the stairs had\r\nsteeled their hearts against all his arts and address--Not a soul\r\noffered to accommodate him with a chair, cushion, or footstool; so that\r\nhe was obliged to sit down on a hard bench--In that position, he looked\r\naround with a rueful aspect, and, bowing very low, said in a\r\nwhining tone, ‘Your most humble servant, ladies--Fire is a dreadful\r\ncalamity’--‘Fire purifies gold, and it ties friendship,’ cried Mrs\r\nTabitha, bridling. ‘Yea, madam (replied Micklewhimmen); and it trieth\r\ndiscretion also’--‘If discretion consists in forsaking a friend in\r\nadversity, you are eminently possessed of that virtue’ (resumed our\r\naunt).--‘Na, madam (rejoined the advocate), well I wot, I cannot claim\r\nany merit from the mode of my retreat--Ye’ll please to observe, ladies,\r\nthere are twa independent principles that actuate our nature--One is\r\ninstinct, which we have in common with the brute creation, and the other\r\nis reason--Noo, in certain great emergencies, when the faculty of reason\r\nis suspended, instinct taks the lead, and when this predominates, having\r\nno affinity with reason, it pays no sort of regard to its connections;\r\nit only operates for the preservation of the individual, and that by the\r\nmost expeditious and effectual means; therefore, begging your pardon,\r\nladies, I’m no accountable in foro conscientioe for what I did, while\r\nunder the influence of this irresistible pooer.’\r\n\r\nHere my uncle interposing, ‘I should be glad to know (said he), whether\r\nit was instinct that prompted you to retreat with bag and baggage; for,\r\nI think, you had a portmanteau on your shoulder’ The lawyer answered,\r\nwithout hesitation, ‘Gif I might tell my mind freely, withoot incuring\r\nthe suspicion of presumption, I should think it was something superior\r\nto either reason or instinct which suggested that measure, and this on\r\na twafold accoont: in the first place, the portmanteau contained the\r\nwritings of a worthy nobleman’s estate; and their being burnt would have\r\noccasioned a loss that could not be repaired; secondly, my good angel\r\nseems to have laid the portmanteau on my shoulders, by way of defence,\r\nto sustain the violence of a most inhuman blow, from the crutch of a\r\nreverend clergyman, which, even in spite of that medium, hath wounded\r\nme sorely, even unto the pericranium.’ ‘By your own doctrine (cried the\r\nparson, who chanced to be present), I am not accountable for the blow,\r\nwhich was the effect of instinct.’ ‘I crave your pardon, reverend sir\r\n(said the other), instinct never acts but for the preservation of the\r\nindividual; but your preservation was out of the case--you had already\r\nreceived the damage, and therefore the blow must be imputed to revenge,\r\nwhich is a sinful passion, that ill becomes any Christian, especially a\r\nprotestant divine; and let me tell you, most reverend doctor, gin I had\r\na mind to plea, the law would hauld my libel relevant.’ ‘Why, the damage\r\nis pretty equal on both sides (cried the parson); your head is broke,\r\nand my crutch is snapt in the middle. Now, if you will repair the one, I\r\nwill be at the expence of curing the other.’\r\n\r\nThis sally raised the laugh against Micklewhimmen, who began to look\r\ngrave; when my uncle, in order to change the discourse, observed,\r\nthat instinct had been very kind to him in another respect; for it had\r\nrestored to him the use of his limbs, which, in his exit, he had moved\r\nwith surprising agility.--He replied, that it was the nature of fear to\r\nbrace up the nerves; and mentioned some surprising feats of strength\r\nand activity performed by persons under the impulse of terror; but he\r\ncomplained that in his own particular, the effects had ceased when the\r\ncause was taken away--The ‘squire said, he would lay a tea-drinking on\r\nhis head, that he should dance a Scotch measure, without making a false\r\nstep; and the advocate grinning, called for the piper--A fidler being\r\nat hand, this original started up, with his bloody napkin over his black\r\ntye-periwig, and acquitted himself in such a manner as excited the mirth\r\nof the whole company; but he could not regain the good graces of Mrs\r\nTabby, who did not understand the principle of instinct; and the lawyer\r\ndid not think it worth his while to proceed to further demonstration.\r\n\r\nFrom Harrigate, we came hither, by the way of York, and here we shall\r\ntarry some days, as my uncle and Tabitha are both resolved to make use\r\nof the waters. Scarborough, though a paltry town, is romantic from its\r\nsituation along a cliff that over-hangs the sea. The harbour is formed\r\nby a small elbow of land that runs out as a natural mole, directly\r\nopposite to the town; and on that side is the castle, which stands very\r\nhigh, of considerable extent, and, before the invention of gun-powder,\r\nwas counted impregnable. At the other end of Scarborough are two public\r\nrooms for the use of the company, who resort to this place in the summer\r\nto drink the waters and bathe in the sea; and the diversions are pretty\r\nmuch on the same footing here as at Bath. The Spa is a little way beyond\r\nthe town, on this side, under a cliff, within a few paces of the sea,\r\nand thither the drinkers go every morning in dishabille; but the descent\r\nis by a great number of steps, which invalids find very inconvenient.\r\nBetwixt the well and the harbour, the bathing machines are ranged along\r\nthe beach, with all their proper utensils and attendants. You have never\r\nseen one of these machines--Image to yourself a small, snug, wooden\r\nchamber, fixed upon a wheel-carriage, having a door at each end, and on\r\neach side a little window above, a bench below--The bather, ascending\r\ninto this apartment by wooden steps, shuts himself in, and begins to\r\nundress, while the attendant yokes a horse to the end next the sea, and\r\ndraws the carriage forwards, till the surface of the water is on a level\r\nwith the floor of the dressing-room, then he moves and fixes the horse\r\nto the other end--The person within being stripped, opens the door to\r\nthe sea-ward, where he finds the guide ready, and plunges headlong into\r\nthe water--After having bathed, he re-ascends into the apartment, by the\r\nsteps which had been shifted for that purpose, and puts on his clothes\r\nat his leisure, while the carriage is drawn back again upon the dry\r\nland; so that he has nothing further to do, but to open the door, and\r\ncome down as he went up--Should he be so weak or ill as to require\r\na servant to put off and on his clothes, there is room enough in the\r\napartment for half a dozen people. The guides who attend the ladies in\r\nthe water, are of their own sex, and they and the female bathers have\r\na dress of flannel for the sea; nay, they are provided with other\r\nconveniences for the support of decorum. A certain number of the\r\nmachines are fitted with tilts, that project from the sea-ward ends\r\nof them, so as to screen the bathers from the view of all persons\r\nwhatsoever--The beach is admirably adapted for this practice, the\r\ndescent being gently gradual, and the sand soft as velvet; but then the\r\nmachines can be used only at a certain time of the tide, which varies\r\nevery day; so that sometimes the bathers are obliged to rise very early\r\nin the morning--For my part, I love swimming as an exercise, and\r\ncan enjoy it at all times of the tide, without the formality of an\r\napparatus--You and I have often plunged together into the Isis; but\r\nthe sea is a much more noble bath, for health as well as pleasure. You\r\ncannot conceive what a flow of spirits it gives, and how it braces every\r\nsinew of the human frame. Were I to enumerate half the diseases which\r\nare every day cured by sea-bathing, you might justly say you had\r\nreceived a treatise, instead of a letter, from\r\n\r\nYour affectionate friend and servant, J. MELFORD SCARBOROUGH, July 1.\r\n\nTo Dr LEWIS.\r\n\r\nI have not found all the benefit I expected at Scarborough, where I have\r\nbeen these eight days--From Harrigate we came hither by the way of York,\r\nwhere we stayed only one day to visit the Castle, the Minster and\r\nthe Assembly-room. The first, which was heretofore a fortress, is now\r\nconverted to a prison, and is the best, in all respects, I ever saw,\r\nat home or abroad--It stands in a high situation, extremely well\r\nventilated; and has a spacious area within the walls, for the health and\r\nconvenience of all the prisoners except those whom it is necessary to\r\nsecure in close confinement. Even these last have all the comforts that\r\nthe nature of their situation can admit. Here the assizes are held, in a\r\nrange of buildings erected for that purpose.\r\n\r\nAs for the Minster, I know not how to distinguish it, except by its\r\ngreat size and the height of its spire, from those other ancient\r\nchurches in different parts of the kingdom, which used to be called\r\nmonuments of Gothic architecture; but it is now agreed, that this stile\r\nis Saracen rather than Gothic; and, I suppose, it was first imported\r\ninto England from Spain, great part of which was under the dominion of\r\nthe Moors. Those British architects who adopted this stile, don’t seem\r\nto have considered the propriety of their adoption. The climate of the\r\ncountry, possessed by the Moors or Saracens, both in Africa and Spain,\r\nwas so exceedingly hot and dry, that those who built places of worship\r\nfor the multitude, employed their talents in contriving edifices that\r\nshould be cool; and, for this purpose, nothing could be better adopted\r\nthan those buildings, vast, narrow, dark, and lofty, impervious to the\r\nsun-beams, and having little communication with the scorched external\r\natmosphere; but ever affording a refreshing coolness, like subterranean\r\ncellars in the heats of summer, or natural caverns in the bowels of huge\r\nmountains. But nothing could be more preposterous, than to imitate such\r\na mode of architecture in a country like England, where the climate\r\nis cold, and the air eternally loaded with vapours; and where, of\r\nconsequence, the builder’s intention should be to keep the people dry\r\nand warm--For my part, I never entered the Abbey church at Bath but\r\nonce, and the moment I stept over the threshold, I found myself chilled\r\nto the very marrow of my bones. When we consider, that in our churches,\r\nin general, we breathe a gross stagnated air, surcharged with damps\r\nfrom vaults, tombs, and charnel-houses, may we not term them so many\r\nmagazines of rheums, created for the benefit of the medical faculty? and\r\nsafely aver, that more bodies are lost, than souls saved, by going to\r\nchurch, in the winter especially, which may be said to engross eight\r\nmonths in the year. I should be glad to know, what offence it would give\r\nto tender consciences, if the house of God was made more comfortable,\r\nor less dangerous to the health of valetudinarians; and whether it\r\nwould not be an encouragement to piety, as well as the salvation of many\r\nlives, if the place of worship was well floored, wainscotted, warmed,\r\nand ventilated, and its area kept sacred from the pollution of the\r\ndead. The practice of burying in churches was the effect of ignorant\r\nsuperstition, influenced by knavish priests, who pretended that the\r\ndevil could have no power over the defunct if he was interred in holy\r\nground; and this indeed, is the only reason that can be given for\r\nconsecrating all cemeteries, even at this day.\r\n\r\nThe external appearance of an old cathedral cannot be but displeasing to\r\nthe eye of every man, who has any idea of propriety or proportion, even\r\nthough he may be ignorant of architecture as a science; and the long\r\nslender spire puts one in mind of a criminal impaled with a sharp stake\r\nrising up through his shoulder--These towers, or steeples, were likewise\r\nborrowed from the Mahometans; who, having no bells, used such minarets\r\nfor the purpose of calling the people to prayers--They may be of further\r\nuse, however, for making observations and signals; but I would vote for\r\ntheir being distinct from the body of the church, because they serve\r\nonly to make the pile more barbarous, or Saracenical.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing of this Arabic architecture in the Assembly Room, which\r\nseems to me to have been built upon a design of Palladio, and might\r\nbe converted into an elegant place of worship; but it is indifferently\r\ncontrived for that sort of idolatry which is performed in it at present:\r\nthe grandeur of the fane gives a diminutive effect to the little painted\r\ndivinities that are adorned in it, and the company, on a ball-night,\r\nmust look like an assembly of fantastic fairies, revelling by moonlight\r\namong the columns of a Grecian temple.\r\n\r\nScarborough seems to be falling off, in point of reputation. All these\r\nplaces (Bath excepted) have their vogue, and then the fashion changes.\r\nI am persuaded, there are fifty spaws in England as efficacious and\r\nsalutary as that of Scarborough, though they have not yet risen to fame;\r\nand, perhaps, never will, unless some medical encomiast should find an\r\ninterest in displaying their virtues to the public view--Be that as it\r\nmay, recourse will always be had to this place for the convenience of\r\nsea bathing, while this practice prevails; but it were to be wished,\r\nthey would make the beach more accessible to invalids.\r\n\r\nI have here met with my old acquaintance, H[ewet]t, whom you have often\r\nheard me mention as one of the most original characters upon earth--I\r\nfirst knew him at Venice, and afterwards saw him in different parts of\r\nItaly, where he was well known by the nick-name of Cavallo Bianco,\r\nfrom his appearing always mounted on a pale horse, like Death in the\r\nRevelations. You must remember the account I once gave you of a curious\r\ndispute he had at Constantinople, with a couple of Turks, in defence of\r\nthe Christian religion; a dispute from which he acquired the epithet\r\nof Demonstrator--The truth is, H--owns no religion but that of nature;\r\nbut, on this occasion, he was stimulated to shew his parts, for the\r\nhonour of his country--Some years ago, being in the Campidoglio at Rome,\r\nhe made up to the bust of Jupiter, and, bowing very low, exclaimed in\r\nthe Italian language, ‘I hope, sir, if ever you get your head above\r\nwater again, you will remember that I paid my respects to you in your\r\nadversity.’ This sally was reported to the cardinal Camerlengo, and by\r\nhim laid before pope Benedict XIV, who could not help laughing at the\r\nextravagance of the address, and said to the cardinal, ‘Those English\r\nheretics think they have a right to go to the devil in their own way.’\r\n\r\nIndeed H-- was the only Englishman I ever knew, who had resolution\r\nenough to live in his own way, in the midst of foreigners; for, neither\r\nin dress, diet, customs, or conversation, did he deviate one tittle from\r\nthe manner in which he had been brought up. About twelve years ago, he\r\nbegan a Giro or circuit, which he thus performed--At Naples, where\r\nhe fixed his headquarters, he embarked for Marseilles, from whence he\r\ntravelled with a Voiturin to Antibes--There he took his passage to\r\nGenoa and Lerici; from which last place he proceeded, by the way of\r\nCambratina, to Pisa and Florence--After having halted some time in\r\nthis metropolis, he set out with a Vetturino for Rome, where he reposed\r\nhimself a few weeks, and then continued his route for Naples, in order\r\nto wait for the next opportunity of embarkation--After having twelve\r\ntimes described this circle, he lately flew off at a tangent to visit\r\nsome trees at his country-house in England, which he had planted above\r\ntwenty years ago, after the plan of the double colonnade in the piazza\r\nof St Peter’s at Rome--He came hither to Scarborough, to pay his\r\nrespects to his noble friend and former pupil, the M-- of G--, and,\r\nforgetting that he is now turned of seventy, sacrificed so liberally to\r\nBacchus, that next day he was seized with a fit of the apoplexy, which\r\nhas a little impaired his memory; but he retains all the oddity of\r\nhis character in perfection, and is going back to Italy by the way of\r\nGeneva, that he may have a conference with his friend Voltaire, about\r\ngiving the last blow to the Christian superstition--He intends to take\r\nshipping here for Holland or Hamburgh; for it is a matter of great\r\nindifference to him at what part of the continent he first lands.\r\n\r\nWhen he was going abroad the last time, he took his passage in a ship\r\nbound for Leghorn, and his baggage was actually embarked. In going down\r\nthe river by water, he was by mistake put on board of another\r\nvessel under sail; and, upon inquiry understood she was bound to\r\nPetersburgh--‘Petersburgh,--Petersburgh (said he) I don’t care if I go\r\nalong with you.’ He forthwith struck a bargain with the captain; bought\r\na couple of shirts of the mate, and was safe conveyed to the court of\r\nMuscovy, from whence he travelled by land to receive his baggage at\r\nLeghorn--He is now more likely than ever to execute a whim of the same\r\nnature; and I will hold any wager, that as he cannot be supposed to live\r\nmuch longer, according to the course of nature, his exit will be as odd\r\nas his life has been extravagant.\r\n\r\n[This gentleman crossed the sea to France, visited and conferred with\r\nMr de Voltaire at Fernay, resumed his old circuit at Genoa, and died in\r\n1767, at the house of Vanini in Florence. Being taken with a suppression\r\nof urine, he resolved, in imitation of Pomponius Atticus, to take\r\nhimself off by abstinence; and this resolution he executed like an\r\nancient Roman. He saw company to the last, cracked his jokes, conversed\r\nfreely, and entertained his guests with music. On the third day of his\r\nfast, he found himself entirely freed of his complaint; but refused\r\ntaking sustenance. He said the most disagreeable part of the voyage was\r\npast, and he should be a cursed fool indeed, to put about ship, when he\r\nwas just entering the harbour. In these sentiments he persisted, without\r\nany marks of affectation, and thus finished his course with such\r\nease and serenity, as would have done honour to the firmest Stoic of\r\nantiquity.]\r\n\r\nBut, to return from one humourist to another, you must know I have\r\nreceived benefit, both from the chalybeate and the sea, and would have\r\nused them longer, had not a most ridiculous adventure, by making me the\r\ntown-talk, obliged me to leave the place; for I can’t bear the thoughts\r\nof affording a spectacle to the multitude. Yesterday morning, at six\r\no’clock, I went down to the bathing-place, attended by my servant\r\nClinker, who waited on the beach as usual--The wind blowing from the\r\nnorth, and the weather being hazy, the water proved so chill, that when\r\nI rose from my first plunge, I could not help sobbing and bawling out,\r\nfrom the effects of the cold. Clinker, who heard me cry, and saw me\r\nindistinctly a good way without the guide, buffetting the waves, took it\r\nfor granted I was drowning, and rushing into the sea, clothes and all,\r\noverturned the guide in his hurry to save his master. I had swam out\r\na few strokes, when hearing a noise, I turned about and saw Clinker,\r\nalready up to his neck, advancing towards me, with all the wildness of\r\nterror in his aspect--Afraid he would get out of his depth, I made haste\r\nto meet him, when, all of a sudden, he seized me by one ear, dragged me\r\nbellowing with pain upon the dry beach, to the astonishment of all the\r\npeople, men, and women, and children there assembled.\r\n\r\nI was so exasperated by the pain of my ear, and the disgrace of being\r\nexposed in such an attitude, that, in the first transport I struck him\r\ndown; then, running back into the sea, took shelter in the machine where\r\nmy clothes had been deposited. I soon recollected myself so far as to do\r\njustice to the poor fellow, who, in great simplicity of heart, had acted\r\nfrom motives of fidelity and affection--Opening the door of the machine,\r\nwhich was immediately drawn on shore, I saw him standing by the wheel,\r\ndropping like a water-work, and trembling from head to foot; partly from\r\ncold, and partly from the dread of having offended his master--I made\r\nmy acknowledgments for the blow he had received, assured him I was\r\nnot angry, and insisted upon his going home immediately, to shift his\r\nclothes; a command which he could hardly find in his heart to execute,\r\nso well disposed was he to furnish the mob with further entertainment\r\nat my expence. Clinker’s intention was laudable without all doubt, but,\r\nnevertheless, I am a sufferer by his simplicity--I have had a burning\r\nheat, and a strange buzzing noise in that ear, ever since it was so\r\nroughly treated; and I cannot walk the street without being pointed at;\r\nas the monster that was hauled naked a-shore upon the beach--Well, I\r\naffirm that folly is often more provoking than knavery, aye and more\r\nmischievous too; and whether a man had not better choose a sensible\r\nrogue, than an honest simpleton for his servant, is no matter of doubt\r\nwith\r\n\r\nYours, MATT. BRAMBLE SCARBOROUGH, July 4.\r\n\nTo Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bart of Jesus college, Oxon.\r\n\r\nDEAR WAT,\r\n\r\nWe made a precipitate retreat from Scarborough, owing to the excessive\r\ndelicacy of our ‘squire, who cannot bear the thoughts of being\r\nproetereuntium digito monstratus.\r\n\r\nOne morning, while he was bathing in the sea, his man Clinker took it\r\nin his head that his master was in danger of drowning; and, in this\r\nconceit, plunging into the water, he lugged him out naked on the beach,\r\nand almost pulled off his ear in the operation. You may guess how this\r\natchievement was relished by Mr Bramble, who is impatient, irascible,\r\nand has the most extravagant ideas of decency and decorum in the\r\noeconomy of his own person--In the first ebullition of his choler, he\r\nknocked Clinker down with his fist; but he afterwards made him amends\r\nfor his outrage, and, in order to avoid further notice of the people,\r\namong whom this incident had made him remarkable, he resolved to leave\r\nScarborough next day.\r\n\r\nWe set out accordingly over the moors, by the way of Whitby, and began\r\nour journey betimes, in hopes of reaching Stockton that night; but\r\nin this hope we were disappointed--In the afternoon, crossing a deep\r\ngutter, made by a torrent, the coach was so hard strained, that one of\r\nthe irons, which connect the frame, snapt, and the leather sling on the\r\nsame side, cracked in the middle. The shock was so great, that my sister\r\nLiddy struck her head against Mrs Tabitha’s nose with such violence that\r\nthe blood flowed; and Win. Jenkins was darted through a small window in\r\nthat part of the carriage next the horses, where she stuck like a bawd\r\nin the pillory, till she was released by the hand of Mr Bramble. We\r\nwere eight miles distant from any place where we could be supplied with\r\nchaises, and it was impossible to proceed with the coach, until the\r\ndamage should be repaired--in this dilemma, we discovered a blacksmith’s\r\nforge on the edge of a small common, about half a mile from the scene\r\nof our disaster, and thither the postilions made shift to draw the\r\ncarriage, slowly, while the company walked a-foot; but we found the\r\nblack-smith had been dead some days; and his wife, who had been lately\r\ndelivered, was deprived of her senses, under the care of a nurse, hired\r\nby the parish. We were exceedingly mortified at this disappointment,\r\nwhich, however, was surmounted by the help of Humphry Clinker, who is a\r\nsurprising compound of genius and simplicity. Finding the tools of\r\nthe defunct, together with some coals in the smithy, he unscrewed the\r\ndamaged iron in a twinkling, and, kindling a fire, united the broken\r\npieces with equal dexterity and dispatch--While he was at work upon\r\nthis operation, the poor woman in the straw, struck with the well-known\r\nsound of the hammer and anvil, started up, and, notwithstanding all the\r\nnurse’s efforts, came running into the smithy, where, throwing her arms\r\nabout Clinker’s neck, ‘Ah, Jacob (cried she) how could you leave me in\r\nsuch a condition?’\r\n\r\nThis incident was too pathetic to occasion mirth--it brought tears into\r\nthe eyes of all present. The poor widow was put to bed again; and we\r\ndid not leave the village without doing something for her benefit--Even\r\nTabitha’s charity was awakened on this occasion. As for the\r\ntender-hearted Humphry Clinker, he hammered the iron and wept at the\r\nsame time--But his ingenuity was not confined to his own province of\r\nfarrier and black-smith--It was necessary to join the leather sling,\r\nwhich had been broke; and this service he likewise performed, by means\r\nof a broken awl, which he new-pointed and ground, a little hemp, which\r\nhe spun into lingels, and a few tacks which he made for the purpose.\r\nUpon the whole, we were in a condition to proceed in little more than\r\nan hour; but even this delay obliged us to pass the night at\r\nGisborough--Next day we crossed the Tees at Stockton, which is a neat\r\nagreeable town; and there we resolved to dine, with purpose to lie at\r\nDurham.\r\n\r\nWhom should we meet in the yard, when we alighted, but Martin the\r\nadventurer? Having handed out the ladies, and conducted them into an\r\napartment, where he payed his compliments to Mrs Tabby, with his usual\r\naddress, he begged leave to speak to my uncle in another room; and\r\nthere, in some confusion, he made an apology for having taken the\r\nliberty to trouble him with a letter at Stevenage. He expressed his\r\nhope, that Mr Bramble had bestowed some consideration on his unhappy\r\ncase, and repeated his desire of being taken into his service.\r\n\r\nMy uncle, calling me into the room, told him, that we were both\r\nvery well inclined to rescue him from a way of life that was equally\r\ndangerous and dishonourable; and that he should have no scruples in\r\ntrusting to his gratitude and fidelity, if he had any employment\r\nfor him, which he thought would suit his qualifications and his\r\ncircumstances; but that all the departments he had mentioned in his\r\nletter, were filled up by persons of whose conduct he had no reason to\r\ncomplain; of consequence he could not, without injustice, deprive any\r\none of them of his bread. Nevertheless, he declared himself ready to\r\nassist him in any feasible project, either with his purse or credit.\r\n\r\nMartin seemed deeply touched at this declaration--The tear started\r\nin his eye, while he said, in a faultering accent--‘Worthy sir--your\r\ngenerosity oppresses me--I never dreamed of troubling you for any\r\npecuniary assistance--indeed I have no occasion--I have been so lucky\r\nat billiards and betting in different places, at Buxton, Harrigate,\r\nScarborough, and Newcastle races, that my stock in ready-money amounts\r\nto three hundred pounds, which I would willingly employ, in prosecuting\r\nsome honest scheme of life; but my friend, justice Buzzard, has set\r\nso many springs for my life, that I am under the necessity of either\r\nretiring immediately to a remote part of the country, where I can enjoy\r\nthe protection of some generous patron, or of quitting the kingdom\r\naltogether. It is upon this alternative that I now beg leave to ask your\r\nadvice. I have had information of all your route, since I had the honour\r\nto see you at Stevenage; and, supposing you would come this way from\r\nScarborough, I came hither last night from Darlington, to pay you my\r\nrespects.’\r\n\r\n‘It would be no difficult matter to provide you with an asylum in the\r\ncountry (replied my uncle); but a life of indolence and obscurity\r\nwould not suit with your active and enterprizing disposition--I would\r\ntherefore advise you to try your fortune in the East Indies--I will\r\ngive you a letter to a friend in London, who will recommend you to the\r\ndirection, for a commission in the company’s service; and if that cannot\r\nbe obtained, you will at least be received as a volunteer--in which\r\ncase, you may pay for your passage, and I shall undertake to procure you\r\nsuch credentials, that you will not be long without a commission.’\r\n\r\nMartin embraced the proposal with great eagerness; it was therefore\r\nresolved, that he should sell his horse, and take a passage by sea\r\nfor London, to execute the project without delay--In the mean time he\r\naccompanied us to Durham, were we took up our quarters for the night.\r\nHere, being furnished with letters from my uncle, he took his leave of\r\nus, with strong symptoms of gratitude and attachment, and set out for\r\nSunderland, in order to embark in the first collier, bound for the\r\nriver Thames. He had not been gone half an hour, when we were joined\r\nby another character, which promised something extraordinary--A tall,\r\nmeagre figure, answering, with his horse, the description of Don Quixote\r\nmounted on Rozinante, appeared in the twilight at the inn door, while my\r\naunt and Liddy stood at a window in the dining-room--He wore a coat,\r\nthe cloth of which had once been scarlet, trimmed with Brandenburgs, now\r\ntotally deprived of their metal, and he had holstercaps and housing\r\nof the same stuff and same antiquity. Perceiving ladies at the window\r\nabove, he endeavoured to dismount with the most graceful air he could\r\nassume; but the ostler neglecting to hold the stirrup when he wheeled\r\noff his right foot, and stood with his whole weight on the other, the\r\ngirth unfortunately gave way, the saddle turned, down came the cavalier\r\nto the ground, and his hat and perriwig falling off, displayed a\r\nhead-piece of various colours, patched and plaistered in a woeful\r\ncondition--The ladies, at the window above, shrieked with affright, on\r\nthe supposition that the stranger had received some notable damages\r\nin his fall; but the greatest injury he had sustained arose from the\r\ndishonour of his descent, aggravated by the disgrace of exposing the\r\ncondition of his cranium; for certain plebeians that were about the\r\ndoor, laughed aloud, in the belief that the captain had got either a\r\nscald head, or a broken head, both equally opprobrious.\r\n\r\nHe forthwith leaped up in a fury, and snatching one of his pistols,\r\nthreatened to put the ostler to death, when another squall from the\r\nwomen checked his resentment. He then bowed to the window, while he\r\nkissed the butt-end of his pistol, which he replaced; adjusted his wig\r\nin great confusion, and led his horse into the stable--By this time I\r\nhad come to the door, and could not help gazing at the strange figure\r\nthat presented itself to my view. He would have measured above six\r\nfeet in height had he stood upright; but he stooped very much; was very\r\nnarrow in the shoulders, and very thick in the calves of his legs, which\r\nwere cased in black spatterdashes--As for his thighs, they were long\r\nand slender, like those of a grasshopper; his face was, at least, half\r\na yard in length, brown and shrivelled, with projecting cheek-bones,\r\nlittle grey eyes on the greenish hue, a large hook-nose, a pointed chin,\r\na mouth from ear to ear, very ill furnished with teeth, and a high,\r\nnarrow fore-head, well furrowed with wrinkles. His horse was exactly\r\nin the stile of its rider; a resurrection of dry bones, which (as we\r\nafterwards learned) he valued exceedingly, as the only present he had\r\never received in his life.\r\n\r\nHaving seen this favourite steed properly accommodated in the stable, he\r\nsent up his compliments to the ladies, begging permission to thank them\r\nin person for the marks of concern they had shewn at his disaster in\r\nthe court yard--As the ‘squire said they could not decently decline\r\nhis visit, he was shewn up stairs and paid his respects in the Scotch\r\ndialect, with much formality ‘Leddies (said he), perhaps ye may be\r\nscandaleezed at the appearance of my heed made, when it was uncovered by\r\naccident; but I can assure you, the condition you saw it in, is neither\r\nthe effects of diseases, nor of drunkenness: but an honest scar received\r\nin the service of my country.’ He then gave us to understand, that\r\nhaving been wounded at Ticonderoga, in America, a party of Indians\r\nrifled him, scalped him, broke his scull with the blow of a tomahawk,\r\nand left him for dead on the field of battle; but that being afterwards\r\nfound with signs of life, he had been cured in the French hospital,\r\nthough the loss of substance could not be repaired; so that the scull\r\nwas left naked in several places, and these he covered with patches.\r\n\r\nThere is no hold by which an Englishman is sooner taken than that of\r\ncompassion--We were immediately interested in behalf of this veteran.\r\nEven Tabby’s heart was melted; but our pity was warmed with indignation,\r\nwhen we learned, that in the course of two sanguinary wars, he had been\r\nwounded, maimed, mutilated, taken, and enslaved, without ever having\r\nattained a higher rank than that of lieutenant--My uncle’s eyes gleamed,\r\nand his nether lip quivered, while he exclaimed, ‘I vow to God, sir,\r\nyour case is a reproach to the service--The injustice you have met\r\nwith is so flagrant’--‘I must crave your pardon, sir (cried the other,\r\ninterrupting him), I complain of no injustice--I purchased an ensigncy\r\nthirty years ago; and, in the course of service rose to a lieutenant,\r\naccording to my seniority’--‘But in such a length of time (resumed the\r\n‘squire), you must have seen a great many young officers put over your\r\nhead’--‘Nevertheless (said he), I have no cause to murmur--They bought\r\ntheir preferment with their money--I had no money to carry to market\r\nthat was my misfortune; but no body was to blame’--‘What! no friend\r\nto advance a sum of money?’ (said Mr Bramble) ‘Perhaps, I might have\r\nborrowed money for the purchase of a company (answered the other);\r\nbut that loan must have been refunded; and I did not chuse to incumber\r\nmyself with a debt of a thousand pounds, to be payed from an income\r\nof ten shillings a-day.’ ‘So you have spent the best part of your life\r\n(cried Mr Bramble), your youth, your blood, and your constitution,\r\namidst the dangers, the difficulties, the horrors and hardships of\r\na war, for the consideration of three or four shillings a-day a\r\nconsideration--’ ‘Sir (replied the Scot, with great warmth), you are the\r\nman that does me injustice, if you say or think I have been actuated by\r\nany such paltry consideration--I am a gentleman; and entered the service\r\nas other gentlemen do, with such hopes and sentiments as honourable\r\nambition inspires--If I have not been lucky in the lottery of life, so\r\nneither do I think myself unfortunate--I owe to no man a farthing; I can\r\nalways command a clean shirt, a mutton-chop, and a truss of straw; and\r\nwhen I die, I shall leave effects sufficient to defray the expence of my\r\nburial.’\r\n\r\nMy uncle assured him, he had no intention to give him the least offence,\r\nby the observations he had made; but, on the contrary, spoke from a\r\nsentiment of friendly regard to his interest--The lieutenant thanked\r\nhim with a stiffness of civility, which nettled our old gentleman, who\r\nperceived that his moderation was all affected; for, whatsoever his\r\ntongue might declare, his whole appearance denoted dissatisfaction--In\r\nshort, without pretending to judge of his military merit, I think I may\r\naffirm, that this Caledonian is a self-conceited pedant, aukward, rude,\r\nand disputacious--He has had the benefit of a school-education, seems\r\nto have read a good number of books, his memory is tenacious, and he\r\npretends to speak several different languages; but he is so addicted to\r\nwrangling, that he will cavil at the clearest truths, and, in the pride\r\nof argumentation, attempt to reconcile contradictions--Whether his\r\naddress and qualifications are really of that stamp which is agreeable\r\nto the taste of our aunt, Mrs Tabitha, or that indefatigable maiden is\r\ndetermined to shoot at every sort of game, certain it is she has begun\r\nto practice upon the heart of the lieutenant, who favoured us with his\r\ncompany to supper.\r\n\r\nI have many other things to say of this man of war, which I shall\r\ncommunicate in a post or two; mean while, it is but reasonable that you\r\nshould be indulged with some respite from those weary lucubrations of\r\n\r\nYours, J. MELFORD NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE, July 10.\r\n\nTo Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS Bart. of Jesus college, Oxon.\r\n\r\nDEAR PHILLIPS,\r\n\r\nIn my last I treated you with a high flavoured dish, in the character\r\nof the Scotch lieutenant, and I must present him once more for your\r\nentertainment. It was our fortune to feed upon him the best part of\r\nthree days; and I do not doubt that he will start again in our way\r\nbefore we shall have finished our northern excursion. The day after our\r\nmeeting with him at Durham proved so tempestuous that we did not choose\r\nto proceed on our journey; and my uncle persuaded him to stay till\r\nthe weather should clear up, giving him, at the same time, a general\r\ninvitation to our mess. The man has certainly gathered a whole budget\r\nof shrewd observations, but he brings them forth in such an ungracious\r\nmanner as would be extremely disgusting, if it was not marked by that\r\ncharacteristic oddity which never fails to attract the attention--He and\r\nMr Bramble discoursed, and even disputed, on different subjects in war,\r\npolicy, the belles lettres, law, and metaphysics; and sometimes they\r\nwere warmed into such altercation as seemed to threaten an abrupt\r\ndissolution of their society; but Mr Bramble set a guard over his own\r\nirascibility, the more vigilantly as the officer was his guest; and\r\nwhen, in spite of all his efforts, he began to wax warm, the other\r\nprudently cooled in the same proportion.\r\n\r\nMrs Tabitha chancing to accost her brother by the familiar diminutive\r\nof Matt, ‘Pray, sir (said the lieutenant), ‘is your name Matthias?’ You\r\nmust know it is one of our uncle’s foibles to be ashamed of his name\r\nMatthew, because it is puritanical; and this question chagrined him\r\nso much, that he answered, ‘No, by G-d!’ in a very abrupt tone of\r\ndispleasure.--The Scot took umbrage at the manner of his reply, and\r\nbristling up, ‘If I had known (said he) that you did not care to tell\r\nyour name, I should not have asked the question--The leddy called you\r\nMatt, and I naturally thought it was Matthias:--perhaps, it may be\r\nMethuselah, or Metrodorus, or Metellus, or Mathurinus, or Malthinnus, or\r\nMatamorus, or--’ ‘No (cried my uncle laughing), it is neither of those,\r\ncaptain: my name is Matthew Bramble, at, your service.--The truth is,\r\nhave a foolish pique at the name of Matthew, because it favours of\r\nthose canting hypocrites, who, in Cromwell’s time, christened all their\r\nchildren by names taken from the scripture.’ ‘A foolish pique indeed.\r\n(cried Mrs Tabby), and even sinful, to fall out with your name because\r\nit is taken from holy writ.--I would have you to know, you was called\r\nafter great-uncle Matthew ap Madoc ap Meredith, esquire, of Llanwysthin,\r\nin Montgomeryshire, justice of the quorum, and crusty ruttleorum, a\r\ngentleman of great worth and property, descended in a strait line, by\r\nthe female side, from Llewellyn, prince of Wales.’\r\n\r\nThis genealogical anecdote seemed to make some impression upon the\r\nNorth-Briton, who bowed very low to the descendant of Llewellyn, and\r\nobserved that he himself had the honour of a scriptural nomination. The\r\nlady expressing a desire of knowing his address, he said, he designed\r\nhimself Lieutenant Obadiah Lismahago; and in order to assist her memory,\r\nhe presented her with a slip of paper inscribed with these three words,\r\nwhich she repeated with great emphasis, declaring, it was one of the\r\nmost noble and sonorous names she had ever heard. He observed that\r\nObadiah was an adventitious appellation, derived from his\r\ngreat-grandfather, who had been one of the original covenanters; but\r\nLismahago was the family surname, taken from a place in Scotland so called.\r\nHe likewise dropped some hints about the antiquity of his pedigree, adding,\r\nwith a smile of self-denial, Sed genus et proavos, et quoe non fecimus\r\nipsi, vix ea nostra voco, which quotation he explained in deference\r\nto the ladies; and Mrs Tabitha did not fail to compliment him on his\r\nmodesty in waving the merit of his ancestry, adding, that it was the\r\nless necessary to him, as he had such a considerable fund of his\r\nown. She now began to glew herself to his favour with the grossest\r\nadulation.--She expatiated upon the antiquity and virtues of the\r\nScottish nation, upon their valour, probity, learning, and politeness.\r\nShe even descended to encomiums on his own personal address, his\r\ngallantry, good sense, and erudition.--She appealed to her brother,\r\nwhether the captain was not the very image of our cousin governor\r\nGriffith. She discovered a surprising eagerness to know the particulars\r\nof his life, and asked a thousand questions concerning his atchievements\r\nin war; all which Mr Lismahago answered with a sort of jesuitical\r\nreserve, affecting a reluctance to satisfy her curiosity on a subject\r\nthat concerned his own exploits.\r\n\r\nBy dint of her interrogations, however, we learned, that he and ensign\r\nMurphy had made their escape from the French hospital at Montreal, and\r\ntaken to the woods, in hope of reaching some English settlement; but\r\nmistaking their route, they fell in with a party of Miamis, who carried\r\nthem away in captivity. The intention of these Indians was to give one\r\nof them as an adopted son to a venerable sachem, who had lost his own\r\nin the course of the war, and to sacrifice the other according to the\r\ncustom of the country. Murphy, as being the younger and handsomer of the\r\ntwo, was designed to fill the place of the deceased, not only as the\r\nson of the sachem, but as the spouse of a beautiful squaw, to whom his\r\npredecessor had been betrothed; but in passing through the different\r\nwhigwhams or villages of the Miamis, poor Murphy was so mangled by the\r\nwomen and children, who have the privilege of torturing all prisoners\r\nin their passage, that, by the time they arrived at the place of the\r\nsachem’s residence, he was rendered altogether unfit for the purposes of\r\nmarriage: it was determined therefore, in the assembly of the warriors,\r\nthat ensign Murphy should be brought to the stake, and that the lady\r\nshould be given to lieutenant Lismahago, who had likewise received his\r\nshare of torments, though they had not produced emasculation.--A joint\r\nof one finger had been cut, or rather sawed off with a rusty knife; one\r\nof his great toes was crushed into a mash betwixt two stones; some of\r\nhis teeth were drawn, or dug out with a crooked nail; splintered reeds\r\nhad been thrust up his nostrils and other tender parts; and the calves\r\nof his legs had been blown up with mines of gunpowder dug in the flesh\r\nwith the sharp point of the tomahawk.\r\n\r\nThe Indians themselves allowed that Murphy died with great heroism,\r\nsinging, as his death song, the Drimmendoo, in concert with Mr\r\nLismahago, who was present at the solemnity. After the warriors and the\r\nmatrons had made a hearty meal upon the muscular flesh which they pared\r\nfrom the victim, and had applied a great variety of tortures, which he\r\nbore without flinching, an old lady, with a sharp knife, scooped out\r\none of his eyes, and put a burning coal in the socket. The pain of this\r\noperation was so exquisite that he could not help bellowing, upon which\r\nthe audience raised a shout of exultation, and one of the warriors\r\nstealing behind him, gave him the coup de grace with a hatchet.\r\n\r\nLismahago’s bride, the squaw Squinkinacoosta, distinguished herself on\r\nthis occasion.--She shewed a great superiority of genius in the tortures\r\nwhich she contrived and executed with her own hands.--She vied with the\r\nstoutest warrior in eating the flesh of the sacrifice; and after all\r\nthe other females were fuddled with dram-drinking, she was not so\r\nintoxicated but that she was able to play the game of the platter with\r\nthe conjuring sachem, and afterwards go through the ceremony of her own\r\nwedding, which was consummated that same evening. The captain had lived\r\nvery happily with this accomplished squaw for two years, during which\r\nshe bore him a son, who is now the representative of his mother’s tribe;\r\nbut, at length, to his unspeakable grief, she had died of a fever,\r\noccasioned by eating too much raw bear, which they had killed in a\r\nhunting excursion.\r\n\r\nBy this time, Mr Lismahago was elected sachem, acknowledged first\r\nwarrior of the Badger tribe, and dignified with the name or epithet of\r\nOccacanastaogarora, which signifies nimble as a weasel; but all these\r\nadvantages and honours he was obliged to resign, in consequence of being\r\nexchanged for the orator of the community, who had been taken prisoner\r\nby the Indians that were in alliance with the English. At the peace, he\r\nhad sold out upon half pay, and was returned to Britain, with a view\r\nto pass the rest of his life in his own country, where he hoped to\r\nfind some retreat where his slender finances would afford him a decent\r\nsubsistence. Such are the outlines of Mr Lismahago’s history, to which\r\nTabitha did seriously incline her ear;--indeed, she seemed to be taken\r\nwith the same charms that captivated the heart of Desdemona, who loved\r\nthe Moor for the dangers he had past.\r\n\r\nThe description of poor Murphy’s sufferings, which threw my sister Liddy\r\ninto a swoon, extracted some sighs from the breast of Mrs Tabby: when\r\nshe understood he had been rendered unfit for marriage, she began to\r\nspit, and ejaculated, ‘Jesus, what cruel barbarians!’ and she made wry\r\nfaces at the lady’s nuptial repast; but she was eagerly curious to know\r\nthe particulars of her marriage-dress; whether she wore high-breasted\r\nstays or bodice, a robe of silk or velvet, and laces of Mechlin or\r\nminionette--she supposed, as they were connected with the French,\r\nshe used rouge, and had her hair dressed in the Parisian fashion. The\r\ncaptain would have declined giving a catagorical explanation of all\r\nthese particulars, observing, in general, that the Indians were\r\ntoo tenacious of their own customs to adopt the modes of any nation\r\nwhatsoever; he said, moreover, that neither the simplicity of their\r\nmanners nor the commerce of their country, would admit of those articles\r\nof luxury which are deemed magnificence in Europe; and that they were\r\ntoo virtuous and sensible to encourage the introduction of any fashion\r\nwhich might help to render them corrupt and effeminate.\r\n\r\nThese observations served only to inflame her desire of knowing the\r\nparticulars about which she had enquired; and, with all his evasion,\r\nhe could not help discovering the following circumstances--that\r\nhis princess had neither shoes, stockings, shift, nor any kind of\r\nlinen--that her bridal dress consisted of a petticoat of red bays, and a\r\nfringed blanket, fastened about her shoulders with a copper skewer; but\r\nof ornaments she had great plenty.--Her hair was curiously plaited, and\r\ninterwoven with bobbins of human bone--one eye-lid was painted green,\r\nand the other yellow; the cheeks were blue, the lips white, the teeth\r\nred, and there was a black list drawn down the middle of the forehead\r\nas far as the tip of the nose--a couple of gaudy parrot’s feathers were\r\nstuck through the division of the nostrils--there was a blue stone set\r\nin the chin, her ear-rings consisted of two pieces of hickery, of the\r\nsize and shape of drum-sticks--her arms and legs were adorned with\r\nbracelets of wampum--her breast glittered with numerous strings of glass\r\nbeads--she wore a curious pouch, or pocket of woven grass, elegantly\r\npainted with various colours--about her neck was hung the fresh scalp\r\nof a Mohawk warrior, whom her deceased lover had lately slain in\r\nbattle--and, finally, she was anointed from head to foot with bear’s\r\ngrease, which sent forth a most agreeable odour.\r\n\r\nOne would imagine that these paraphernalia would not have been much\r\nadmired by a modern fine lady; but Mrs Tabitha was resolved to approve\r\nof all the captains connexions.--She wished, indeed, the squaw had been\r\nbetter provided with linen; but she owned there was much taste and\r\nfancy in her ornaments; she made no doubt, therefore, that madam\r\nSquinkinacoosta was a young lady of good sense and rare accomplishments,\r\nand a good christian at bottom. Then she asked whether his consort had\r\nbeen high church or low-church, presbyterian or anabaptist, or had been\r\nfavoured with any glimmering of the new light of the gospel? When he\r\nconfessed that she and her whole nation were utter strangers to the\r\nchristian faith, she gazed at him with signs of astonishment, and\r\nHumphry Clinker, who chanced to be in the room, uttered a hollow groan.\r\n\r\nAfter some pause, ‘In the name of God, captain Lismahago (cried she),\r\nwhat religion do they profess?’ ‘As to religion, madam (answered\r\nthe lieutenant), it is among those Indians a matter of great\r\nsimplicity--they never heard of any Alliance between Church and\r\nState.--They, in general, worship two contending principles; one the\r\nFountain of all Good, the other the source of all evil. The common\r\npeople there, as in other countries, run into the absurdities of\r\nsuperstition; but sensible men pay adoration to a Supreme Being, who\r\ncreated and sustains the universe.’ ‘O! what pity (exclaimed the pious\r\nTabby), that some holy man has not been inspired to go and convert these\r\npoor heathens!’\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant told her, that while he resided among them, two French\r\nmissionaries arrived, in order to convert them to the catholic religion;\r\nbut when they talked of mysteries and revelations, which they could\r\nneither explain nor authenticate, and called in the evidence of miracles\r\nwhich they believed upon hearsay; when they taught that the Supreme\r\nCreator of Heaven and Earth had allowed his only Son, his own equal in\r\npower and glory, to enter the bowels of a woman, to be born as a\r\nhuman creature, to be insulted, flagellated, and even executed as a\r\nmalefactor; when they pretended to create God himself, to swallow,\r\ndigest, revive, and multiply him ad infinitum, by the help of a little\r\nflour and water, the Indians were shocked at the impiety of their\r\npresumption.--They were examined by the assembly of the sachems\r\nwho desired them to prove the divinity of their mission by some\r\nmiracle.--They answered, that it was not in their power.--‘If you were\r\nreally sent by Heaven for our conversion (said one of the sachems), you\r\nwould certainly have some supernatural endowments, at least you would\r\nhave the gift of tongues, in order to explain your doctrine to the\r\ndifferent nations among which you are employed; but you are so ignorant\r\nof our language, that you cannot express yourselves even on the most\r\ntrifling subjects.’ In a word, the assembly were convinced of their\r\nbeing cheats, and even suspected them of being spies: they ordered them\r\na bag of Indian corn apiece, and appointed a guide to conduct them to\r\nthe frontiers; but the missionaries having more zeal than discretion,\r\nrefused to quit the vineyard.--They persisted in saying mass, in\r\npreaching, baptizing, and squabbling with the conjurers, or priests\r\nof the country, till they had thrown the whole community into\r\nconfusion.--Then the assembly proceeded to try them as impious\r\nimpostors, who represented the Almighty as a trifling, weak, capricious\r\nbeing, and pretended to make, unmake, and reproduce him at pleasure;\r\nthey were, therefore, convicted of blasphemy and sedition, and condemned\r\nto the stake, where they died singing Salve regina, in a rapture of joy,\r\nfor the crown of martyrdom which they had thus obtained.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this conversation, lieutenant Lismahago dropt some\r\nhints by which it appeared he himself was a free-thinker. Our aunt\r\nseemed to be startled at certain sarcasms he threw out against the creed\r\nof saint Athanasius--He dwelt much upon the words, reason, philosophy,\r\nand contradiction in terms--he bid defiance to the eternity of\r\nhell-fire; and even threw such squibs at the immortality of the soul, as\r\nsinged a little the whiskers of Mrs Tabitha’s faith; for, by this\r\ntime she began to look upon Lismahago as a prodigy of learning and\r\nsagacity.--In short, he could be no longer insensible to the advances\r\nshe made towards his affection; and although there was something\r\nrepulsive in his nature, he overcame it so far as to make some return\r\nto her civilities.--Perhaps, he thought it would be no bad scheme, in\r\na superannuated lieutenant on half-pay, to effect a conjunction with an\r\nold maid, who, in all probability, had fortune enough to keep him easy\r\nand comfortable in the fag-end of his days--An ogling correspondence\r\nforthwith commenced between this amiable pair of originals--He began\r\nto sweeten the natural acidity of his discourse with the treacle of\r\ncompliment and commendation--He from time to time offered her snuff, of\r\nwhich he himself took great quantities, and even made her a present of a\r\npurse of silk grass, woven by the hands of the amiable Squinkinacoosta,\r\nwho had used it as a shot-pouch in her hunting expeditions.\r\n\r\nFrom Doncaster northwards, all the windows of all the inns are scrawled\r\nwith doggeral rhimes, in abuse of the Scotch nation; and what surprised\r\nme very much, I did not perceive one line written in the way of\r\nrecrimination--Curious to hear what Lismahago would say on this subject,\r\nI pointed out to him a very scurrilous epigram against his countrymen,\r\nwhich was engraved on one of the windows of the parlour where we\r\nsat.--He read it with the most starched composure; and when I asked his\r\nopinion of the poetry, ‘It is vara terse and vara poignant (said he);\r\nbut with the help of a wat dish-clout, it might be rendered more clear\r\nand parspicuous.--I marvel much that some modern wit has not published a\r\ncollection of these essays under the title of the Glaziers Triumph over\r\nSawney the Scot--I’m persuaded it would be a vara agreeable offering to\r\nthe patriots of London and Westminster.’ When I expressed some surprize\r\nthat the natives of Scotland, who travel this way, had not broke all the\r\nwindows upon the road, ‘With submission (replied the lieutenant), that\r\nwere but shallow policy--it would only serve to make the satire more\r\ncutting and severe; and I think it is much better to let it stand in the\r\nwindow, than have it presented in the reckoning.’\r\n\r\nMy uncle’s jaws began to quiver with indignation.--He said, the\r\nscribblers of such infamous stuff deserved to be scourged at the cart’s\r\ntail for disgracing their country with such monuments of malice and\r\nstupidity.--‘These vermin (said he) do not consider, that they are\r\naffording their fellow subjects, whom they abuse, continual matter\r\nof self-gratulation, as well as the means of executing the most manly\r\nvengeance that can be taken for such low, illiberal attacks. For my\r\npart, I admire the philosophic forbearance of the Scots, as much as I\r\ndespise the insolence of those wretched libellers, which is akin to\r\nthe arrogance of the village cock, who never crows but upon his own\r\ndunghill.’ The captain, with an affectation of candour, observed, that\r\nmen of illiberal minds were produced in every soil; that in supposing\r\nthose were the sentiments of the English in general, he should pay\r\ntoo great a compliment to is own country, which was not of consequence\r\nenough to attract the envy of such a flourishing and powerful people.\r\n\r\nMrs Tabby broke forth again in praise of his moderation, and declared\r\nthat Scotland was the soil which produced every virtue under heaven.\r\nWhen Lismahago took his leave for the night, she asked her brother\r\nif the captain was not the prettiest gentleman he had ever seen; and\r\nwhether there was not something wonderfully engaging in his aspect?--Mr\r\nBramble having eyed her sometime in silence, ‘Sister (said he), the\r\nlieutenant is, for aught I know, an honest man and a good officer--he\r\nhas a considerable share of understanding, and a title to more\r\nencouragement than he seems to have met with in life; but I cannot, with\r\na safe conscience, affirm, that he is the prettiest gentleman I ever\r\nsaw; neither can I descern any engaging charm in his countenance, which,\r\nI vow to God, is, on the contrary, very hard-favoured and forbidding.’\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured to ingratiate myself with this North-Briton, who is\r\nreally a curiosity; but he has been very shy of my conversation ever\r\nsince I laughed at his asserting that the English tongue was spoke with\r\nmore propriety at Edinburgh than at London. Looking at me with a double\r\nsqueeze of souring in his aspect, ‘If the old definition be true (said\r\nhe), that risibility is the distinguishing characteristic of a rational\r\ncreature, the English are the most distinguished for rationality of any\r\npeople I ever knew.’ I owned, that the English were easily struck with\r\nany thing that appeared ludicrous, and apt to laugh accordingly; but it\r\ndid not follow, that, because they were more given to laughter, they had\r\nmore rationality than their neighbours: I said, such an inference\r\nwould be an injury to the Scots, who were by no means defective in\r\nrationality, though generally supposed little subject to the impressions\r\nof humour.\r\n\r\nThe captain answered, that this supposition must have been deduced\r\neither from their conversation or their compositions, of which the\r\nEnglish could not possibly judge with precision, as they did not\r\nunderstand the dialect used by the Scots in common discourse, as well\r\nas in their works of humour. When I desired to know what those works\r\nof humour were, he mentioned a considerable number of pieces, which\r\nhe insisted were equal in point of humour to any thing extant in any\r\nlanguage dead or living--He, in particular, recommended a collection of\r\ndetached poems, in two small volumes, intituled, The Ever-Green, and\r\nthe works of Allan Ramsay, which I intend to provide myself with at\r\nEdinburgh.--He observed, that a North-Briton is seen to a disadvantage\r\nin an English company, because he speaks in a dialect that they can’t\r\nrelish, and in a phraseology which they don’t understand.--He therefore\r\nfinds himself under a restraint, which is a great enemy to wit and\r\nhumour.--These are faculties which never appear in full lustre, but when\r\nthe mind is perfectly at ease, and, as an excellent writer says, enjoys\r\nher elbow-room.\r\n\r\nHe proceeded to explain his assertion that the English language was\r\nspoken with greater propriety at Edinburgh than in London. He said, what\r\nwe generally called the Scottish dialect was, in fact, true, genuine old\r\nEnglish, with a mixture of some French terms and idioms, adopted in a\r\nlong intercourse betwixt the French and Scotch nations; that the modern\r\nEnglish, from affectation and false refinement, had weakened, and even\r\ncorrupted their language, by throwing out the guttural sounds, altering\r\nthe pronunciation and the quantity, and disusing many words and terms\r\nof great significance. In consequence of these innovations, the works\r\nof our best poets, such as Chaucer, Spenser, and even Shakespeare, were\r\nbecome, in many parts, unintelligible to the natives of South Britain,\r\nwhereas the Scots, who retain the antient language, understand them\r\nwithout the help of a glossary. ‘For instance (said he), how have\r\nyour commentators been puzzled by the following expression in the\r\nTempest--He’s gentle and not fearful: as if it was a paralogism to say,\r\nthat being gentle, he must of course be courageous: but the truth is,\r\none of the original meanings, if not the sole meaning, of that word was,\r\nnoble, high-minded; and to this day, a Scotch woman, in the situation of\r\nthe young lady in the Tempest, would express herself nearly in the same\r\nterms--Don’t provoke him; for being gentle, that is, high-spirited, he\r\nwon’t tamely bear an insult. Spenser, in the very first stanza of his\r\nFairy Queen, says,\r\n\r\n A gentle knight was pricking on the plain;\r\n Which knight, far from being tame and fearful, was so stout that\r\n Nothing did he dread, but ever was ydrad.\r\n\r\nTo prove that we had impaired the energy of our language by false\r\nrefinement, he mentioned the following words, which, though widely\r\ndifferent in signification, are pronounced exactly in the same manner\r\nwright, write, right, rite; but among the Scots, these words are as\r\ndifferent in pronunciation, as they are in meaning and orthography;\r\nand this is the case with many others which he mentioned by way of\r\nillustration.--He, moreover, took notice, that we had (for what reason\r\nhe could never learn) altered the sound of our vowels from that which is\r\nretained by all the nations in Europe; an alteration which rendered\r\nthe language extremely difficult to foreigners, and made it\r\nalmost impracticable to lay down general rules for orthography and\r\npronunciation. Besides, the vowels were no longer simple sounds in\r\nthe mouth of an Englishman, who pronounced both i and u as dipthongs.\r\nFinally, he affirmed, that we mumbled our speech with our lips and\r\nteeth, and ran the words together without pause or distinction, in such\r\na manner, that a foreigner, though he understood English tolerably well,\r\nwas often obliged to have recourse to a Scotchman to explain what a\r\nnative of England had said in his own language.\r\n\r\nThe truth of this remark was confirmed by Mr Bramble from his own\r\nexperience; but he accounted for it on another principle. He said,\r\nthe same observation would hold in all languages; that a Swiss talking\r\nFrench was more easily understood than a Parisian, by a foreigner who\r\nhad not made himself master of the language; because every language\r\nhad its peculiar recitative, and it would always require more pains,\r\nattention, and practice, to acquire both the words and the music, than\r\nto learn the words only; and yet no body would deny, that the one\r\nwas imperfect without the other: he therefore apprehended, that the\r\nScotchman and the Swiss were better understood by learners, because they\r\nspoke the words only, without the music, which they could not rehearse.\r\nOne would imagine this check might have damped the North Briton; but it\r\nserved only to agitate his humour for disputation.--He said, if every\r\nnation had its own recitative or music, the Scots had theirs, and the\r\nScotchman who had not yet acquired the cadence of the English, would\r\nnaturally use his own in speaking their language; therefore, if he\r\nwas better understood than the native, his recitative must be more\r\nintelligible than that of the English; of consequence, the dialect of\r\nthe Scots had an advantage over that of their fellow-subjects, and this\r\nwas another strong presumption that the modern English had corrupted\r\ntheir language in the article of pronunciation.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant was, by this time, become so polemical, that every time\r\nhe opened his mouth out flew a paradox, which he maintained with all the\r\nenthusiasm of altercation; but all his paradoxes favoured strong of a\r\npartiality for his own country. He undertook to prove that poverty was\r\na blessing to a nation; that oatmeal was preferable to wheat-flour; and\r\nthat the worship of Cloacina, in temples which admitted both sexes, and\r\nevery rank of votaries promiscuously, was a filthy species of idolatry\r\nthat outraged every idea of delicacy and decorum. I did not so much\r\nwonder at his broaching these doctrines, as at the arguments, equally\r\nwhimsical and ingenious, which he adduced in support of them.\r\n\r\nIn fine, lieutenant Lismahago is a curiosity which I have not yet\r\nsufficiently perused; and therefore I shall be sorry when we lose his\r\ncompany, though, God knows, there is nothing very amiable in his manner\r\nor disposition.--As he goes directly to the south-west division of\r\nScotland, and we proceed in the road to Berwick, we shall part tomorrow\r\nat a place called Feltonbridge; and, I dare say, this separation will\r\nbe very grievous to our aunt Mrs Tabitha, unless she has received some\r\nflattering assurance of his meeting her again. If I fail in my purpose\r\nof entertaining you with these unimportant occurrences, they will at\r\nleast serve as exercises of patience, for which you are indebted to\r\n\nYours always, J. MELFORD MORPETH, July 13.\r\n\nTo Dr LEWIS.\r\n\r\nDEAR DOCTOR,\r\n\r\nI have now reached the northern extremity of England, and see, close to\r\nmy chamber-window, the Tweed gliding through the arches of that bridge\r\nwhich connects this suburb to the town of Berwick.--Yorkshire you have\r\nseen, and therefore I shall say nothing of that opulent province.\r\nThe city of Durham appears like a confused heap of stones and brick,\r\naccumulated so as to cover a mountain, round which a river winds its\r\nbrawling course. The Streets are generally narrow, dark, and unpleasant,\r\nand many of them almost impassible in consequence of their declivity.\r\nThe cathedral is a huge gloomy pile; but the clergy are well lodged.--\r\nThe bishop lives in a princely manner--the golden prebends keep\r\nplentiful tables--and, I am told, there is some good sociable company in\r\nthe place; but the country, when viewed from the top of Gateshead-Fell,\r\nwhich extends to Newcastle, exhibits the highest scene of cultivation\r\nthat ever I beheld. As for Newcastle, it lies mostly in a bottom, on the\r\nbanks of the Tyne, and makes an appearance still more disagreeable than\r\nthat of Durham; but it is rendered populous and rich by industry and\r\ncommerce; and the country lying on both sides the river, above the town,\r\nyields a delightful prospect of agriculture and plantation. Morpeth and\r\nAlnwick are neat, pretty towns, and this last is famous for the castle\r\nwhich has belonged so many ages to the noble house of Piercy, earls of\r\nNorthumberland.--It is, doubtless, a large edifice, containing a great\r\nnumber of apartments, and stands in a commanding situation; but the\r\nstrength of it seems to have consisted not so much in its site, or the\r\nmanner in which it is fortified, as in the valour of its defendants.\r\n\r\nOur adventures since we left Scarborough, are scarce worth reciting;\r\nand yet I must make you acquainted with my sister Tabby’s progress in\r\nhusband-hunting, after her disappointments at Bath and London. She had\r\nactually begun to practise upon a certain adventurer, who was in fact\r\na highwayman by profession; but he had been used to snares much more\r\ndangerous than any she could lay, and escaped accordingly. Then she\r\nopened her batteries upon an old weather-beaten Scotch lieutenant,\r\ncalled Lismahago, who joined us at Durham, and is, I think, one of the\r\nmost singular personages I ever encountered--His manner is as harsh\r\nas his countenance; but his peculiar turn of thinking, and his pack of\r\nknowledge made up of the remnants of rarities, rendered his conversation\r\ndesirable, in spite of his pedantry and ungracious address. I have often\r\nmet with a crab-apple in a hedge, which I have been tempted to eat for\r\nits flavour, even while I was disgusted by its austerity. The spirit of\r\ncontradiction is naturally so strong in Lismahago, that I believe in\r\nmy conscience he has rummaged, and read, and studied with indefatigable\r\nattention, in order to qualify himself to refute established maxims, and\r\nthus raise trophies for the gratification of polemical pride.--Such is\r\nthe asperity of his self-conceit, that he will not even acquiesce in a\r\ntransient compliment made to his own individual in particular, or to his\r\ncountry in general.\r\n\r\nWhen I observed, that he must have read a vast number of books to be\r\nable to discourse on such a variety of subjects, he declared he had read\r\nlittle or nothing, and asked how he should find books among the woods\r\nof America, where he had spent the greatest part of his life. My nephew\r\nremarking that the Scots in general were famous for their learning, he\r\ndenied the imputation, and defied him to prove it from their works--‘The\r\nScots (said he) have a slight tincture of letters, with which they make\r\na parade among people who are more illiterate than themselves; but they\r\nmay be said to float on the surface of science, and they have made very\r\nsmall advances in the useful arts.’ ‘At least (cried Tabby), all\r\nthe world allows that the Scots behaved gloriously in fighting and\r\nconquering the savages of America.’ ‘I can assure you, madam, you have\r\nbeen misinformed (replied the lieutenant); in that continent the\r\nScots did nothing more than their duty, nor was there one corps in his\r\nmajesty’s service that distinguished itself more than another.--Those\r\nwho affected to extol the Scots for superior merit, were no friends to\r\nthat nation.’\r\n\r\nThough he himself made free with his countrymen, he would not suffer\r\nany other person to glance a sarcasm at them with impunity. One of the\r\ncompany chancing to mention lord B--‘s inglorious peace, the lieutenant\r\nimmediately took up the cudgels in his lordship’s favour, and\r\nargued very strenuously to prove that it was the most honourable and\r\nadvantageous peace that England had ever made since the foundation of\r\nthe monarchy.--Nay, between friends, he offered such reasons on this\r\nsubject, that I was really confounded, if not convinced.--He would not\r\nallow that the Scots abounded above their proportion in the army and\r\nnavy of Great-Britain, or that the English had any reason to say his\r\ncountrymen had met with extraordinary encouragement in the service.\r\n‘When a South and North-Briton (said he) are competitors for a place\r\nor commission, which is in the disposal of an English minister or an\r\nEnglish general, it would be absurd to suppose that the preference will\r\nnot be given to the native of England, who has so many advantages over\r\nhis rival.--First and foremost, he has in his favour that laudable\r\npartiality, which, Mr Addison says, never fails to cleave to the heart\r\nof an Englishman; secondly, he has more powerful connexions, and a\r\ngreater share of parliamentary interest, by which those contests are\r\ngenerally decided; and lastly, he has a greater command of money to\r\nsmooth the way to his success. For my own part (said he), I know no\r\nScotch officer, who has risen in the army above the rank of a subaltern,\r\nwithout purchasing every degree of preferment either with money or\r\nrecruits; but I know many gentlemen of that country, who, for want of\r\nmoney and interest, have grown grey in the rank of lieutenants; whereas\r\nvery few instances of this ill-fortune are to be found among the natives\r\nof South-Britain.--Not that I would insinuate that my countrymen have\r\nthe least reason to complain. Preferment in the service, like success\r\nin any other branch of traffic, will naturally favour those who have\r\nthe greatest stock of cash and credit, merit and capacity being supposed\r\nequal on all sides.’\r\n\r\nBut the most hardy of all this original’s positions were these: That\r\ncommerce would, sooner or later, prove the ruin of every nation, where\r\nit flourishes to any extent--that the parliament was the rotten part of\r\nthe British constitution--that the liberty of the press was a national\r\nevil--and that the boasted institution of juries, as managed in England,\r\nwas productive of shameful perjury and flagrant injustice. He observed,\r\nthat traffick was an enemy to all the liberal passions of the soul,\r\nfounded on the thirst of lucre, a sordid disposition to take advantage\r\nof the necessities of our fellow creatures.--He affirmed, the nature\r\nof commerce was such, that it could not be fixed or perpetuated, but,\r\nhaving flowed to a certain height, would immediately begin to ebb, and\r\nso continue till the channels should be left almost dry; but there\r\nwas no instance of the tide’s rising a second time to any considerable\r\ninflux in the same nation. Mean while the sudden affluence occasioned\r\nby trade, forced open all the sluices of luxury and overflowed the land\r\nwith every species of profligacy and corruption; a total pravity of\r\nmanners would ensue, and this must be attended with bankruptcy and ruin.\r\nHe observed of the parliament, that the practice of buying boroughs,\r\nand canvassing for votes, was an avowed system of venality, already\r\nestablished on the ruins of principle, integrity, faith, and good order,\r\nin consequence of which the elected and the elector, and, in short, the\r\nwhole body of the people, were equally and universally contaminated and\r\ncorrupted. He affirmed, that of a parliament thus constituted, the crown\r\nwould always have influence enough to secure a great majority in its\r\ndependence, from the great number of posts, places, and pensions it\r\nhad to bestow; that such a parliament would (as it had already done)\r\nlengthen the term of its sitting and authority, whenever the prince\r\nshould think it for his interest to continue the representatives, for,\r\nwithout doubt, they had the same right to protect their authority ad\r\ninfinitum, as they had to extend it from three to seven years.--With a\r\nparliament, therefore, dependent upon the crown, devoted to the prince,\r\nand supported by a standing army, garbled and modelled for the purpose,\r\nany king of England may, and probably some ambitious sovereign will,\r\ntotally overthrow all the bulwarks of the constitution; for it is not\r\nto be supposed that a prince of high spirit will tamely submit to be\r\nthwarted in all his measures, abused and insulted by a populace of\r\nunbridled ferocity, when he has it in his power to crush all opposition\r\nunder his feet with the concurrence of the legislature. He said, he\r\nshould always consider the liberty of the press as a national evil,\r\nwhile it enabled the vilest reptile to soil the lustre of the most\r\nshining merit, and furnished the most infamous incendiary with the means\r\nof disturbing the peace and destroying the good order of the community.\r\nHe owned, however, that under due restrictions, it would be a valuable\r\nprivilege; but affirmed, that at present there was no law in England\r\nsufficient to restrain it within proper bounds.\r\n\r\nWith respect to juries, he expressed himself to this effect:--juries\r\nare generally composed of illiterate plebeians, apt to be mistaken,\r\neasily misled, and open to sinister influence; for if either of the\r\nparties to be tried, can gain over one of the twelve jurors, he has\r\nsecured the verdict in his favour; the juryman thus brought over will,\r\nin despight of all evidence and conviction, generally hold out till his\r\nfellows are fatigued, and harassed, and starved into concurrence; in\r\nwhich case the verdict is unjust, and the jurors are all perjured: but\r\ncases will often occur, when the jurors are really divided in opinion,\r\nand each side is convinced in opposition to the other; but no verdict\r\nwill be received, unless they are unanimous, and they are all bound, not\r\nonly in conscience, but by oath, to judge and declare according to their\r\nconviction.--What then will be the consequence?--They must either\r\nstarve in company, or one side must sacrifice their conscience to their\r\nconvenience, and join in a verdict which they believe to be false. This\r\nabsurdity is avoided in Sweden, where a bare majority is sufficient; and\r\nin Scotland, where two thirds of the jury are required to concur in the\r\nverdict.\r\n\r\nYou must not imagine that all these deductions were made on his part,\r\nwithout contradictions on mine.--No--the truth is, I found myself piqued\r\nin point of honour, at his pretending to be so much wiser than his\r\nneighbours.--I questioned all his assertions, started innumerable\r\nobjections, argued and wrangled with uncommon perseverance, and grew\r\nvery warm, and even violent, in the debate.--Sometimes he was puzzled,\r\nand once or twice, I think, fairly refuted; but from those falls he rose\r\nagain, like Antaeus, with redoubled vigour, till at length I was tired,\r\nexhausted, and really did not know how to proceed, when luckily he\r\ndropped a hint, by which he discovered he had been bred to the law;\r\na confession which enabled me to retire from the dispute with a good\r\ngrace, as it could not be supposed that a man like me, who had been bred\r\nto nothing, should be able to cope with a veteran in his own profession.\r\nI believe, however, that I shall for some time continue to chew the cud\r\nof reflection upon many observations which this original discharged.\r\n\r\nWhether our sister Tabby was really struck with his conversation, or is\r\nresolved to throw at every thing she meets in the shape of a man, till\r\nshe can fasten the matrimonial noose, certain it is, she has taken\r\ndesperate strides towards the affection of Lismahago, who cannot be said\r\nto have met her half way, though he does not seem altogether insensible\r\nto her civilities.--She insinuated more than once how happy we should be\r\nto have his company through that part of Scotland which we proposed\r\nto visit, till at length he plainly told us, that his road was totally\r\ndifferent from that which we intended to take; that, for his part, his\r\ncompany would be of very little service to us in our progress, as he was\r\nutterly unacquainted with the country, which he had left in his early\r\nyouth, consequently, he could neither direct us in our enquiries, nor\r\nintroduce us to any family of distinction. He said, he was stimulated\r\nby an irresistible impulse to revisit the paternus lar, or patria domus,\r\nthough he expected little satisfaction, inasmuch as he understood that\r\nhis nephew, the present possessor, was but ill qualified to support the\r\nhonour of the family.--He assured us, however, as we design to return by\r\nthe west road, that he will watch our motions, and endeavour to pay his\r\nrespects to us at Dumfries.--Accordingly he took his leave of us at a\r\nplace half way betwixt Morpeth and Alnwick, and pranced away in great\r\nstate, mounted on a tall, meagre, raw-boned, shambling grey gelding,\r\nwithout e’er a tooth in his head, the very counter-part of the rider;\r\nand, indeed, the appearance of the two was so picturesque, that I would\r\ngive twenty guineas to have them tolerably presented on canvas.\r\n\r\nNorthumberland is a fine county, extending to the Tweed, which is a\r\npleasant pastoral stream; but you will be surprised when I tell you\r\nthat the English side of that river is neither so well cultivated nor\r\nso populous as the other.--The farms are thinly scattered, the lands\r\nuninclosed, and scarce a gentleman’s seat is to be seen in some miles\r\nfrom the Tweed; whereas the Scots are advanced in crowds to the very\r\nbrink of the river, so that you may reckon above thirty good houses, in\r\nthe compass of a few miles, belonging to proprietors whose ancestors had\r\nfortified castles in the same situations, a circumstance that shews what\r\ndangerous neighbours the Scots must have formerly been to the northern\r\ncounties of England.\r\n\r\nOur domestic oeconomy continues on the old footing.--My sister Tabby\r\nstill adheres to methodism, and had the benefit of a sermon at Wesley’s\r\nmeeting in Newcastle; but I believe the Passion of love has in some\r\nmeasure abated the fervour of devotion both in her and her woman,\r\nMrs Jenkins, about whose good graces there has been a violent contest\r\nbetwixt my nephew’s valet, Mr Dutton, and my man, Humphry Clinker.--Jery\r\nhas been obliged to interpose his authority to keep the peace, and to\r\nhim I have left the discussion of that important affair, which had like\r\nto have kindled the flames of discord in the family of\r\n\r\nYours always, MATT. BRAMBLE TWEEDMOUTH, July 15.\r\n\nTo Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bart. at Oxon.\r\n\r\nDEAR WAT,\r\n\r\nIn my two last you had so much of Lismahago, that I suppose you are\r\nglad he is gone off the stage for the present.--I must now descend\r\nto domestic occurrences.--Love, it seems, is resolved to assert his\r\ndominion over all the females of our family.--After having practised\r\nupon poor Liddy’s heart, and played strange vagaries with our aunt\r\nMrs Tabitha, he began to run riot in the affections of her woman, Mrs\r\nWinifred Jenkins, whom I have had occasion to mention more than once in\r\nthe course of our memoirs. Nature intended Jenkins for something very\r\ndifferent from the character of her mistress; yet custom and habit have\r\neffected a wonderful resemblance betwixt them in many particulars. Win,\r\nto be sure, is much younger and more agreeable in her person; she is\r\nlikewise tender-hearted and benevolent, qualities for which her mistress\r\nis by no means remarkable, no more than she is for being of a timorous\r\ndisposition, and much subject to fits of the mother, which are the\r\ninfirmities of Win’s constitution: but then she seems to have adopted\r\nMrs Tabby’s manner with her cast cloaths.--She dresses and endeavours\r\nto look like her mistress, although her own looks are much more\r\nengaging.--She enters into her scheme of oeconomy, learns her phrases,\r\nrepeats her remarks, imitates her stile in scolding the inferior\r\nservants, and, finally, subscribes implicitly to her system of\r\ndevotion.--This, indeed, she found the more agreeable, as it was in a\r\ngreat measure introduced and confirmed by the ministry of Clinker,\r\nwith whose personal merit she seems to have been struck ever since he\r\nexhibited the pattern of his naked skin at Marlborough.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, though Humphry had this double hank upon her inclinations,\r\nand exerted all his power to maintain the conquest he had made, he found\r\nit impossible to guard it on the side of vanity, where poor Win was as\r\nfrail as any female in the kingdom. In short, my rascal Dutton professed\r\nhimself her admirer, and, by dint of his outlandish qualifications,\r\nthrew his rival Clinker out of the saddle of her heart. Humphry may be\r\ncompared to an English pudding, composed of good wholesome flour and\r\nsuet, and Dutton to a syllabub or iced froth, which, though agreeable\r\nto the taste, has nothing solid or substantial. The traitor not only\r\ndazzled her, with his second-hand finery, but he fawned, and flattered,\r\nand cringed--he taught her to take rappee, and presented her with\r\na snuff-box of papier mache--he supplied her with a powder for her\r\nteeth--he mended her complexion, and he dressed her hair in the Paris\r\nfashion--he undertook to be her French master and her dancing-master,\r\nas well as friseur, and thus imperceptibly wound himself into her good\r\ngraces. Clinker perceived the progress he had made, and repined in\r\nsecret.--He attempted to open her eyes in the way of exhortation, and\r\nfinding it produced no effect had recourse to prayer. At Newcastle,\r\nwhile he attended Mrs Tabby to the methodist meeting his rival\r\naccompanied Mrs Jenkins to the play. He was dressed in a silk coat, made\r\nat Paris for his former master, with a tawdry waistcoat of tarnished\r\nbrocade; he wore his hair in a great bag with a huge solitaire, and a\r\nlong sword dangled from his thigh. The lady was all of a flutter with\r\nfaded lutestring, washed gauze, and ribbons three times refreshed; but\r\nshe was most remarkable for the frisure of her head, which rose, like\r\na pyramid, seven inches above the scalp, and her face was primed and\r\npatched from the chin up to the eyes; nay, the gallant himself had\r\nspared neither red nor white in improving the nature of his own\r\ncomplexion. In this attire, they walked together through the high street\r\nto the theatre, and as they passed for players ready dressed for\r\nacting, they reached it unmolested; but as it was still light when they\r\nreturned, and by that time the people had got information of their real\r\ncharacter and condition, they hissed and hooted all the way, and Mrs\r\nJenkins was all bespattered with dirt, as well as insulted with\r\nthe opprobrious name of painted Jezabel, so that her fright and\r\nmortification threw her into an hysteric fit the moment she came home.\r\n\r\nClinker was so incensed at Dutton, whom he considered as the cause of\r\nher disgrace, that he upbraided him severely for having turned the\r\npoor woman’s brain. The other affected to treat him with contempt, and\r\nmistaking his forbearance for want of courage, threatened to horse-whip\r\nhim into good manners. Humphry then came to me, humbly begging I\r\nwould give him leave to chastise my servant for his insolence--‘He has\r\nchallenged me to fight him at sword’s point (said he); but I might as\r\nwell challenge him to make a horse-shoe, or a plough iron; for I know no\r\nmore of the one than he does of the other.--Besides, it doth not become\r\nservants to use those weapons, or to claim the privilege of gentlemen\r\nto kill one another when they fall out; moreover, I would not have\r\nhis blood upon my conscience for ten thousand times the profit or\r\nsatisfaction I should get by his death; but if your honour won’t be\r\nangry, I’ll engage to gee ‘en a good drubbing, that, may hap, will do\r\n‘en service, and I’ll take care it shall do ‘en no harm.’ I said, I had\r\nno objection to what he proposed, provided he could manage matters so as\r\nnot to be found the aggressor, in case Dutton should prosecute him for\r\nan assault and battery.\r\n\r\nThus licensed, he retired; and that same evening easily provoked\r\nhis rival to strike the first blow, which Clinker returned with such\r\ninterest that he was obliged to call for quarter, declaring, at the same\r\ntime, that he would exact severe and bloody satisfaction the moment we\r\nshould pass the border, when he could run him through the body without\r\nfear of the consequence.--This scene passed in presence of lieutenant\r\nLismahago, who encouraged Clinker to hazard a thrust of cold iron with\r\nhis antagonist. ‘Cold iron (cried Humphry) I shall never use against\r\nthe life of any human creature; but I am so far from being afraid of\r\nhis cold iron, that I shall use nothing in my defence but a good cudgel,\r\nwhich shall always be at his service.’ In the mean time, the fair\r\ncause of this contest, Mrs Winifred Jenkins, seemed overwhelmed with\r\naffliction, and Mr Clinker acted much on the reserve, though he did not\r\npresume to find fault with her conduct.\r\n\r\nThe dispute between the two rivals was soon brought to a very unexpected\r\nissue. Among our fellow-lodgers at Berwick, was a couple from London,\r\nbound to Edinburgh, on the voyage of matrimony. The female was the\r\ndaughter and heiress of a pawnbroker deceased, who had given her\r\nguardians the slip, and put herself under the tuition of a tall\r\nHibernian, who had conducted her thus far in quest of a clergyman to\r\nunite them in marriage, without the formalities required by the law\r\nof England. I know not how the lover had behaved on the road, so as to\r\ndecline in the favour of his inamorata; but, in all probability, Dutton\r\nperceived a coldness on her side, which encouraged him to whisper,\r\nit was a pity she should have cast affections upon a taylor, which he\r\naffirmed the Irishman to be. This discovery completed her disgust, of\r\nwhich my man taking the advantage, began to recommend himself to her\r\ngood graces, and the smooth-tongued rascal found no difficulty to\r\ninsinuate himself into the place of her heart, from which the other had\r\nbeen discarded--Their resolution was immediately taken. In the morning,\r\nbefore day, while poor Teague lay snoring a-bed, his indefatigable rival\r\nordered a post-chaise, and set out with the lady for Coldstream, a few\r\nmiles up the Tweed, where there was a parson who dealt in this branch of\r\ncommerce, and there they were noosed, before the Irishman ever dreamt\r\nof the matter. But when he got up at six o’clock, and found the bird was\r\nflown, he made such a noise as alarmed the whole house. One of the first\r\npersons he encountered, was the postilion returned from Coldstream,\r\nwhere he had been witness to the marriage, and over and above an\r\nhandsome gratuity, had received a bride’s favour, which he now wore in\r\nhis cap--When the forsaken lover understood they were actually married,\r\nand set out for London; and that Dutton had discovered to the lady, that\r\nhe (the Hibernian) was a taylor, he had like to have run distracted. He\r\ntore the ribbon from the fellow’s cap, and beat it about his ears.\r\nHe swore he would pursue him to the gates of hell, and ordered\r\na post-chaise and four to be got ready as soon as possible; but,\r\nrecollecting that his finances would not admit of this way of\r\ntravelling, he was obliged to countermand this order.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I knew nothing at all of what had happened, till the\r\npostilion brought me the keys of my trunk and portmanteau, which he had\r\nreceived from Dutton, who sent me his respects, hoping I would excuse\r\nhim for his abrupt departure, as it was a step upon which his fortune\r\ndepended. Before I had time to make my uncle acquainted with this\r\nevent, the Irishman burst into my chamber, without any introduction,\r\nexclaiming,--‘By my soul, your sarvant has robbed me of five\r\nthousand pounds, and I’ll have satisfaction, if I should be hanged\r\ntomorrow.’--When I asked him who he was, ‘My name (said he) is Master\r\nMacloughlin but it should be Leighlin Oneale, for I am come from\r\nTir-Owen the Great; and so I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland;\r\nand that rogue, your sarvant, said I was a taylor, which was as big\r\na lie as if he had called me the pope--I’m a man of fortune, and have\r\nspent all I had; and so being in distress, Mr Coshgrave, the fashioner\r\nin Shuffolk-street, tuck me out, and made me his own private shecretary:\r\nby the same token, I was the last he bailed; for his friends obliged him\r\nto tie himself up, that he would bail no more above ten pounds; for why,\r\nbecaase as how, he could not refuse any body that asked, and therefore\r\nin time would have robbed himself of his whole fortune, and, if he had\r\nlived long at that rate, must have died bankrupt very soon and so I\r\nmade my addresses to Miss Skinner, a young lady of five thousand pounds\r\nfortune, who agreed to take me for better nor worse; and, to be sure,\r\nthis day would have put me in possession, if it had not been for that\r\nrogue, your sarvant, who came like a tief, and stole away my property,\r\nand made her believe I was a taylor; and that she was going to marry the\r\nninth part of a man: but the devil burn my soul, if ever I catch him on\r\nthe mountains of Tulloghobegly, if I don’t shew him that I’m nine times\r\nas good a man as he, or e’er a bug of his country.’\r\n\r\nWhen he had rung out his first alarm, I told him I was sorry he had\r\nallowed himself to be so jockied; but it was no business of mine; and\r\nthat the fellow who robbed him of his bride, had likewise robbed me of\r\nmy servant--‘Didn’t I tell you then (cried he) that Rogue was his true\r\nChristian name.--Oh if I had but one fair trust with him upon the sod,\r\nI’d give him lave to brag all the rest of his life.’\r\n\r\nMy uncle hearing the noise, came in, and being informed of this\r\nadventure, began to comfort Mr Oneale for the lady’s elopement;\r\nobserving that he seemed to have had a lucky escape, that it was better\r\nshe should elope before, than after marriage--The Hibernian was of a\r\nvery different opinion. He said, ‘If he had been once married, she might\r\nhave eloped as soon as she pleased; he would have taken care that she\r\nshould not have carried her fortune along with her--Ah (said he) she’s\r\na Judas Iscariot, and has betrayed me with a kiss; and, like Judas, she\r\ncarried the bag, and has not left me money enough to bear my expences\r\nback to London; and so I’m come to this pass, and the rogue that was\r\nthe occasion of it has left you without a sarvant, you may put me in his\r\nplace; and by Jasus, it is the best thing you can do.’--I begged to be\r\nexcused, declaring I could put up with any inconvenience, rather than\r\ntreat as a footman the descendant of Tir-Owen the Great. I advised\r\nhim to return to his friend, Mr Cosgrave, and take his passage from\r\nNewcastle by sea, towards which I made him a small present, and he\r\nretired, seemingly resigned to his evil fortune. I have taken upon trial\r\na Scotchman, called Archy M’Alpin, an old soldier, whose last master, a\r\ncolonel, lately died at Berwick. The fellow is old and withered; but he\r\nhas been recommended to me for his fidelity, by Mrs Humphreys, a very\r\ngood sort of a woman, who keeps the inn at Tweedmouth, and is much\r\nrespected by all the travellers on this road.\r\n\r\nClinker, without doubt, thinks himself happy in the removal of a\r\ndangerous rival, and he is too good a Christian, to repine at Dutton’s\r\nsuccess. Even Mrs Jenkins will have reason to congratulate herself upon\r\nthis event, when she cooly reflects upon the matter; for, howsoever she\r\nwas forced from her poise for a season, by snares laid for her vanity,\r\nHumphry is certainly the north-star to which the needle of her affection\r\nwould have pointed at the long run. At present, the same vanity is\r\nexceedingly mortified, upon finding herself abandoned by her new\r\nadmirer, in favour of another inamorata. She received the news with a\r\nviolent burst of laughter, which soon brought on a fit of crying; and\r\nthis gave the finishing blow to the patience of her mistress, which had\r\nheld out beyond all expectation. She now opened all those floodgates of\r\nreprehension, which had been shut so long. She not only reproached\r\nher with her levity and indiscretion, but attacked her on the score\r\nof religion, declaring roundly that she was in a state of apostacy\r\nand reprobation; and finally, threatened to send her a packing at this\r\nextremity of the kingdom. All the family interceded for poor Winifred,\r\nnot even excepting her slighted swain, Mr Clinker, who, on his knees,\r\nimplored and obtained her pardon.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, another consideration that gave Mrs Tabitha some\r\ndisturbance. At Newcastle, the servants had been informed by some\r\nwag, that there was nothing to eat in Scotland, but oat-meal and\r\nsheep’s-heads; and lieutenant Lismahago being consulted, what he said\r\nserved rather to confirm than to refute the report. Our aunt being\r\napprised of this circumstance, very gravely advised her brother to\r\nprovide a sumpter horse with store of hams, tongues, bread, biscuit, and\r\nother articles for our subsistence, in the course of our peregrination,\r\nand Mr Bramble as gravely replied, that he would take the hint into\r\nconsideration: but, finding no such provision was made, she now revived\r\nthe proposal, observing that there was a tolerable market at Berwick,\r\nwhere we might be supplied; and that my man’s horse would serve as a\r\nbeast of burthen--The ‘squire, shrugging his shoulders, eyed her askance\r\nwith a look of ineffable contempt: and, after some pause, ‘Sister (said\r\nhe), I can hardly persuade myself you are serious.’ She was so little\r\nacquainted with the geography of the island, that she imagined we could\r\nnot go to Scotland but by sea; and, after we had passed through the town\r\nof Berwick, when he told her we were upon Scottish ground, she could\r\nhardly believe the assertion--If the truth must be told, the South\r\nBritons in general are woefully ignorant in this particular. What,\r\nbetween want of curiosity, and traditional sarcasms, the effect of\r\nancient animosity, the people at the other end of the island know as\r\nlittle of Scotland as of Japan.\r\n\r\nIf I had never been in Wales, I should have been more struck with the\r\nmanifest difference in appearance betwixt the peasants and commonalty\r\non different sides of the Tweed. The boors of Northumberland are\r\nlusty fellows, fresh complexioned, cleanly, and well cloathed; but the\r\nlabourers in Scotland are generally lank, lean, hard-featured, sallow,\r\nsoiled, and shabby, and their little pinched blue caps have a beggarly\r\neffect. The cattle are much in the same stile with their drivers,\r\nmeagre, stunted, and ill equipt. When I talked to my uncle on this\r\nsubject, he said, ‘Though all the Scottish hinds would not bear to be\r\ncompared with those of the rich counties of South Britain, they would\r\nstand very well in competition with the peasants of France, Italy, and\r\nSavoy--not to mention the mountaineers of Wales, and the red-shanks of\r\nIreland.’\r\n\r\nWe entered Scotland by a frightful moor of sixteen miles, which promises\r\nvery little for the interior parts of the kingdom; but the prospect\r\nmended as we advanced. Passing through Dunbar, which is a neat little\r\ntown, situated on the sea-side, we lay at a country inn, where our\r\nentertainment far exceeded our expectation; but for this we cannot give\r\nthe Scots credit, as the landlord is a native of England. Yesterday we\r\ndined at Haddington, which has been a place of some consideration, but\r\nis now gone to decay; and in the evening arrived at this metropolis, of\r\nwhich I can say very little. It is very romantic, from its situation\r\non the declivity of a hill, having a fortified castle at the top, and a\r\nroyal palace at the bottom. The first thing that strikes the nose of\r\na stranger, shall be nameless; but what first strikes the eye, is the\r\nunconscionable height of the houses, which generally rise to five, six,\r\nseven, and eight stories, and, in some places (as I am assured),\r\nto twelve. This manner of building, attended with numberless\r\ninconveniences, must have been originally owing to want of room. Certain\r\nit is, the town seems to be full of people: but their looks, their\r\nlanguage, and their customs, are so different from ours, that I can\r\nhardly believe myself in Great-Britain.\r\n\r\nThe inn at which we put up (if it may be so called) was so filthy and\r\ndisagreeable in all respects, that my uncle began to fret, and his\r\ngouty symptoms to recur--Recollecting, however, that he had a letter\r\nof recommendation to one Mr Mitchelson, a lawyer, he sent it by his\r\nservant, with a compliment, importing that we would wait upon him next\r\nday in person; but that gentleman visited us immediately, and insisted\r\nupon our going to his own house, until he could provide lodgings for our\r\naccommodation. We gladly accepted, of his invitation, and repaired to\r\nhis house, where we were treated with equal elegance and hospitality, to\r\nthe utter confusion of our aunt, whose prejudices, though beginning to\r\ngive way, were not yet entirely removed. To-day, by the assistance\r\nof our friend, we are settled in convenient lodgings, up four pair\r\nof stairs, in the High-street, the fourth story being, in this city,\r\nreckoned more genteel than the first. The air is, in all probability,\r\nthe better; but it requires good lungs to breathe it at this distance\r\nabove the surface of the earth.--While I do remain above it, whether\r\nhigher or lower, provided I breathe at all,\r\n\nI shall ever be, Dear Phillips, yours, J. MELFORD July 18.\r\n\nTo Dr LEWIS.\r\n\r\nDEAR LEWIS,\r\n\r\nThat part of Scotland contiguous to Berwick, nature seems to have\r\nintended as a barrier between two hostile nations. It is a brown desert\r\nof considerable extent, that produces nothing but heath and fern; and\r\nwhat rendered it the more dreary when we passed, there was a thick fog\r\nthat hindered us from seeing above twenty yards from the carriage--My\r\nsister began to make wry faces, and use her smelling-bottle; Liddy\r\nlooked blank, and Mrs Jenkins dejected; but in a few hours these clouds\r\nwere dissipated; the sea appeared upon our right, and on the left the\r\nmountains retired a little, leaving an agreeable plain betwixt them\r\nand the beach; but, what surprised us all, this plain, to the extent of\r\nseveral miles, was covered with as fine wheat as ever I saw in the most\r\nfertile parts of South Britain--This plentiful crop is raised in the\r\nopen field, without any inclosure, or other manure than the alga marina,\r\nor seaweed, which abounds on this coast; a circumstance which shews\r\nthat the soil and climate are favourable; but that agriculture in this\r\ncountry is not yet brought to that perfection which it has attained\r\nin England. Inclosures would not only keep the grounds warm, and the\r\nseveral fields distinct, but would also protect the crop from the high\r\nwinds, which are so frequent in this part of the island.\r\n\r\nDunbar is well situated for trade, and has a curious bason, where ships\r\nof small burthen may be perfectly secure; but there is little appearance\r\nof business in the place--From thence, all the way to Edinburgh, there\r\nis a continual succession of fine seats, belonging to noblemen and\r\ngentlemen; and as each is surrounded by its own parks and plantation,\r\nthey produce a very pleasing effect in a country which lies otherwise\r\nopen and exposed. At Dunbar there is a noble park, with a lodge,\r\nbelonging to the Duke of Roxburgh, where Oliver Cromwell had his\r\nhead-quarters, when Lesley, at the head of a Scotch army, took\r\npossession of the mountains in the neighbourhood, and hampered him in\r\nsuch a manner, that he would have been obliged to embark and get away by\r\nsea, had not the fanaticism of the enemy forfeited the advantage which\r\nthey had obtained by their general’s conduct--Their ministers, by\r\nexhortation, prayer, assurance, and prophecy, instigated them to go\r\ndown and slay the Philistines in Gilgal, and they quitted their ground\r\naccordingly, notwithstanding all that Lesley could do to restrain\r\nthe madness of their enthusiasm--When Oliver saw them in motion, he\r\nexclaimed, ‘Praised be the Lord, he hath delivered them into the hands\r\nof his servant!’ and ordered his troops to sing a psalm of thanksgiving,\r\nwhile they advanced in order to the plain, where the Scots were routed\r\nwith great slaughter.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Haddington, there is a gentleman’s house, in\r\nthe building of which, and the improvements about it, he is said to have\r\nexpended forty thousand pounds: but I cannot say I was much pleased\r\nwith either the architecture or the situation; though it has in front\r\na pastoral stream, the banks of which are laid out in a very agreeable\r\nmanner. I intended to pay my respects to Lord Elibank, whom I had\r\nthe honour to know at London many years ago. He lives in this part of\r\nLothian; but was gone to the North, on a visit--You have often heard\r\nme mention this nobleman, whom I have long revered for his humanity and\r\nuniversal intelligence, over and above the entertainment arising\r\nfrom originality of his character--At Musselburgh, however, I had the\r\ngood-fortune to drink tea with my old friend Mr Cardonel; and at his\r\nhouse I met with Dr C--, the parson of the parish, whose humour and\r\nconversation inflamed me with a desire of being better acquainted with\r\nhis person--I am not at all surprised that these Scots make their way in\r\nevery quarter of the globe.\r\n\r\nThis place is but four miles from Edinburgh, towards which we proceeded\r\nalong the sea-shore, upon a firm bottom of smooth sand, which the tide\r\nhad left uncovered in its retreat--Edinburgh, from this avenue, is not\r\nseen to much advantage--We had only an imperfect view of the Castle\r\nand upper parts of the town, which varied incessantly according to the\r\ninflexions of the road, and exhibited the appearance of detached spires\r\nand turrets, belonging to some magnificent edifice in ruins. The palace\r\nof Holyrood house stands on the left, as you enter the Canon-gate--This\r\nis a street continued from hence to the gate called Nether Bow, which is\r\nnow taken away; so that there is no interruption for a long mile, from\r\nthe bottom to the top of the hill on which the castle stands in a most\r\nimperial situation--Considering its fine pavement, its width, and the\r\nlofty houses on each side, this would be undoubtedly one of the noblest\r\nstreets in Europe, if an ugly mass of mean buildings, called the\r\nLucken-Booths, had not thrust itself, by what accident I know not, into\r\nthe middle of the way, like Middle-Row in Holborn. The city stands upon\r\ntwo hills, and the bottom between them; and, with all its defects, may\r\nvery well pass for the capital of a moderate kingdom.--It is full of\r\npeople, and continually resounds with the noise of coaches and other\r\ncarriages, for luxury as well as commerce. As far as I can perceive,\r\nhere is no want of provisions--The beef and mutton are as delicate\r\nhere as in Wales; the sea affords plenty of good fish; the bread is\r\nremarkably fine; and the water is excellent, though I’m afraid not\r\nin sufficient quantity to answer all the purposes of cleanliness and\r\nconvenience; articles in which, it must be allowed, our fellow-subjects\r\nare a little defective--The water is brought in leaden pipes from a\r\nmountain in the neighbourhood, to a cistern on the Castle-hill, from\r\nwhence it is distributed to public conduits in different parts of the\r\ncity. From these it is carried in barrels, on the backs of male and\r\nfemale porters, up two, three, four, five, six, seven, and eight\r\npairs of stairs, for the use of particular families--Every story is\r\na complete house, occupied by a separate family; and the stair being\r\ncommon to them all, is generally left in a very filthy condition; a man\r\nmust tread with great circumspection to get safe housed with unpolluted\r\nshoes--Nothing can form a stronger contrast, than the difference\r\nbetwixt the outside and inside of the door, for the good-women of this\r\nmetropolis are remarkably nice in the ornaments and propriety of their\r\napartments, as if they were resolved to transfer the imputation from\r\nthe individual to the public. You are no stranger to their method of\r\ndischarging all their impurities from their windows, at a certain hour\r\nof the night, as the custom is in Spain, Portugal, and some parts of\r\nFrance and Italy--A practice to which I can by no means be reconciled;\r\nfor notwithstanding all the care that is taken by their scavengers to\r\nremove this nuisance every morning by break of day, enough still remains\r\nto offend the eyes, as well as other organs of those whom use has not\r\nhardened against all delicacy of sensation.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants seem insensible to these impressions, and are apt to\r\nimagine the disgust that we avow is little better than affectation; but\r\nthey ought to have some compassion for strangers, who have not been used\r\nto this kind of sufferance; and consider, whether it may not be worth\r\nwhile to take some pains to vindicate themselves from the reproach that,\r\non this account, they bear among their neighbours. As to the surprising\r\nheight of their houses, it is absurd in many respects; but in one\r\nparticular light I cannot view it without horror; that is, the dreadful\r\nsituation of all the families above, in case the common staircase should\r\nbe rendered impassable by a fire in the lower stories--In order to\r\nprevent the shocking consequences that must attend such an accident, it\r\nwould be a right measure to open doors of communication from one house\r\nto another, on every story, by which the people might fly from such\r\na terrible visitation. In all parts of the world, we see the force of\r\nhabit prevailing over all the dictates of convenience and sagacity. All\r\nthe people of business at Edinburgh, and even the genteel company, may\r\nbe seen standing in crowds every day, from one to two in the afternoon,\r\nin the open street, at a place where formerly stood a market-cross,\r\nwhich (by the bye) was a curious piece of Gothic architecture, still to\r\nbe seen in lord Sommerville’s garden in this neighbourhood--I say, the\r\npeople stand in the open street from the force of custom, rather than\r\nmove a few yards to an Exchange that stands empty on one side, or to the\r\nParliament-close on the other, which is a noble square adorned with a\r\nfine equestrian statue of king Charles II.--The company thus assembled,\r\nare entertained with a variety of tunes, played upon a set of bells,\r\nfixed in a steeple hard by--As these bells are well-toned, and the\r\nmusician, who has a salary from the city, for playing upon them with\r\nkeys, is no bad performer, the entertainment is really agreeable, and\r\nvery striking to the ears of a stranger.\r\n\r\nThe public inns of Edinburgh are still worse than those of London; but\r\nby means of a worthy gentleman, to whom I was recommended, we have\r\ngot decent lodgings in the house of a widow gentlewoman of the name of\r\nLockhart; and here I shall stay until I have seen every thing that\r\nis remarkable in and about this capital. I now begin to feel the good\r\neffects of exercise--I eat like a farmer, sleep from mid-night till\r\neight in the morning without interruption, and enjoy a constant tide of\r\nspirits, equally distant from inanition and excess; but whatever ebbs\r\nor flows my constitution may undergo, my heart will still declare that I\r\nam,\r\n\r\nDear Lewis, Your affectionate friend and servant, MATT. BRAMBLE EDR.\r\nJuly 18.\r\n\nTo Mrs MARY JONES, at Brambleton-hall.\r\n\r\nDEAR MARY,\r\n\r\nThe ‘squire has been so kind as to rap my bit of nonsense under the\r\nkiver of his own sheet--O, Mary Jones! Mary Jones! I have had trials and\r\ntrembulation. God help me! I have been a vixen and a griffin these many\r\ndays--Sattin has had power to temp me in the shape of van Ditton,\r\nthe young ‘squire’s wally de shamble; but by God’s grease he did\r\nnot purvail--I thoft as how, there was no arm in going to a play at\r\nNewcastle, with my hair dressed in the Parish fashion; and as for the\r\ntrifle of paint, he said as how my complexion wanted touch, and so I\r\nlet him put it on with a little Spanish owl; but a mischievous mob of\r\ncolliers, and such promiscous ribble rabble, that could bare no smut\r\nbut their own, attacked us in the street, and called me hoar and painted\r\nIssabel, and splashed my close, and spoiled me a complete set of blond\r\nlace triple ruffles, not a pin the worse for the ware--They cost me\r\nseven good sillings, to lady Griskin’s woman at London.\r\n\r\nWhen I axed Mr Clinker what they meant by calling me Issabel, he put the\r\nbyebill into my hand, and I read of van Issabel a painted harlot, that\r\nvas thrown out of a vindore, and the dogs came and licked her blood.\r\nBut I am no harlot; and, with God’s blessing, no dog shall have my poor\r\nblood to lick: marry, Heaven forbid, amen! As for Ditton, after all his\r\ncourting, and his compliment, he stole away an Irishman’s bride, and\r\ntook a French leave of me and his master; but I vally not his going a\r\nfarting; but I have had hanger on his account--Mistriss scoulded like\r\nmad; thof I have the comfit that all the family took my part, and even\r\nMr Clinker pleaded for me on his bended knee; thof, God he knows, he\r\nhad raisins enuff to complain; but he’s a good sole, abounding with\r\nChristian meekness, and one day will meet with his reward.\r\n\r\nAnd now, dear Mary, we have got to Haddingborrough, among the Scots, who\r\nare civil enuff for our money, thof I don’t speak their lingo--But they\r\nshould not go for to impose upon foreigners; for the bills in their\r\nhouses say, they have different easements to let; and behold there is\r\nnurro geaks in the whole kingdom, nor any thing for poor sarvants, but\r\na barrel with a pair of tongs thrown a-cross; and all the chairs in the\r\nfamily are emptied into this here barrel once a-day; and at ten o’clock\r\nat night the whole cargo is flung out of a back windore that looks into\r\nsome street or lane, and the maids calls gardy loo to the passengers\r\nwhich signifies Lord have mercy upon you! and this is done every night\r\nin every house in Haddingborrough; so you may guess, Mary Jones, what a\r\nsweet savour comes from such a number of profuming pans; but they say it\r\nis wholesome, and, truly, I believe it is; for being in the vapours, and\r\nthinking of Issabel and Mr Clinker, I was going into a fit of astericks,\r\nwhen this fiff, saving your presence, took me by the nose so powerfully\r\nthat I sneezed three times, and found myself wonderfully refreshed; and\r\nthis to be sure is the raisin why there are no fits in Haddingborrough.\r\n\r\nI was likewise made believe, that there was nothing to be had but\r\noatmeal and seeps-heads; but if I hadn’t been a fool, I mought have\r\nknown there could be no heads without kerkasses--This very blessed day\r\nI dined upon a delicate leg of Velsh mutton and cully-flower; and as\r\nfor the oat-meal, I leave that to the sarvants of the country, which are\r\npore drudges, many of them without shoes or stockings--Mr Clinker tells\r\nme here is a great call of the gospel; but I wish, I wish some of\r\nour family be not fallen off from the rite way--O, if I was given to\r\ntailbaring, I have my own secrets to discover--There has been a deal\r\nof huggling and flurtation betwixt mistress and an ould Scotch officer,\r\ncalled Kismycago. He looks for all the orld like the scare-crow that our\r\ngardener has set up to frite away the sparrows; and what will come of\r\nit, the Lord knows; but come what will, it shall never be said that I\r\nmenchioned a syllabub of the matter--Remember me kindly to Saul and the\r\nkitten--I hope they got the horn-buck, and will put it to a good yuse,\r\nwhich is the constant prayer of,\r\n\r\nDear Molly, Your loving friend, WIN. JENKINS ADDINGBOROUGH, July 18.\r\n\nTo Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bart. of Jesus college, Oxon.\r\n\r\nDEAR PHILLIPS,\r\n\r\nIf I stay much longer at Edinburgh, I shall be changed into a downright\r\nCaledonian--My uncle observes, that I have already acquired something of\r\nthe country accent. The people here are so social and attentive in their\r\ncivilities to strangers, that I am insensibly sucked into the channel of\r\ntheir manners and customs, although they are in fact much more different\r\nfrom ours than you can imagine--That difference, however, which struck\r\nme very much at my first arrival, I now hardly perceive, and my ear is\r\nperfectly reconciled to the Scotch accent, which I find even agreeable\r\nin the mouth of a pretty woman--It is a sort of Doric dialect, which\r\ngives an idea of amiable simplicity--You cannot imagine how we have\r\nbeen caressed and feasted in the good town of Edinburgh of which we are\r\nbecome free denizens and guild brothers, by the special favour of the\r\nmagistracy.\r\n\r\nI had a whimsical commission from Bath, to a citizen of this metropolis.\r\nQuin, understanding our intention to visit Edinburgh, pulled out a\r\nguinea, and desired the favour I would drink it at a tavern, with a\r\nparticular friend and bottle-companion of his, Mr R-- C--, a lawyer of\r\nthis city--I charged myself with the commission, and, taking the guinea,\r\n‘You see (said I) I have pocketed your bounty.’ ‘Yes (replied Quin,\r\nlaughing); and a headake into the bargain, if you drink fair.’ I made\r\nuse of this introduction to Mr C--, who received me with open arms,\r\nand gave me the rendezvous, according to the cartel. He had provided a\r\ncompany of jolly fellows, among whom I found myself extremely happy;\r\nand did Mr C-- and Quin all the justice in my power; but, alas, I was no\r\nmore than a tiro among a troop of veterans, who had compassion upon my\r\nyouth and conveyed me home in the morning by what means I know not--Quin\r\nwas mistaken, however, as to the head-ake; the claret was too good to\r\ntreat me so roughly.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr Bramble holds conferences with the graver literati of the\r\nplace, and our females are entertained at visits by the Scotch ladies,\r\nwho are the best and kindest creatures upon earth, I pass my time among\r\nthe bucks of Edinburgh; who, with a great share of spirit and vivacity,\r\nhave a certain shrewdness and self-command that is not often found\r\namong their neighbours, in the high-day of youth and exultation--Not\r\na hint escapes a Scotchman that can be interpreted into offence by any\r\nindividual in the company; and national reflections are never heard--In\r\nthis particular, I must own, we are both unjust and ungrateful to the\r\nScots; for, as far as I am able to judge, they have a real esteem for\r\nthe natives of South-Britain; and never mention our country, but with\r\nexpressions of regard--Nevertheless, they are far from being servile\r\nimitators of our modes and fashionable vices. All their customs and\r\nregulations of public and private oeconomy, of business and diversion,\r\nare in their own stile. This remarkably predominates in their looks,\r\ntheir dress and manner, their music, and even their cookery. Our ‘squire\r\ndeclares, that he knows not another people upon earth, so strongly\r\nmarked with a national character--Now we are upon the article of\r\ncookery, I must own, some of their dishes are savoury, and even\r\ndelicate; but I am not yet Scotchman enough to relish their singed\r\nsheep’s-head and haggice, which were provided at our request, one day at\r\nMr Mitchelson’s, where we dined--The first put me in mind of the history\r\nof Congo, in which I had read of negroes’ heads sold publickly in\r\nthe markets; the last, being a mess of minced lights, livers, suet,\r\noat-meal, onions, and pepper, inclosed in a sheep’s stomach, had a very\r\nsudden effect upon mine, and the delicate Mrs Tabby changed colour; when\r\nthe cause of our disgust was instantaneously removed at the nod of our\r\nentertainer. The Scots, in general, are attached to this composition,\r\nwith a sort of national fondness, as well as to their oat-meal bread;\r\nwhich is presented at every table, in thin triangular cakes, baked upon\r\na plate of iron, called a girdle; and these, many of the natives, even\r\nin the higher ranks of life, prefer to wheaten-bread, which they have\r\nhere in perfection--You know we used to vex poor Murray of Baliol\r\ncollege, by asking, if there was really no fruit but turnips in\r\nScotland?--Sure enough, I have seen turnips make their appearance, not\r\nas a desert, but by way of hors d’oeuvres, or whets, as radishes are\r\nserved betwixt more substantial dishes in France and Italy; but it must\r\nbe observed, that the turnips of this country are as much superior in\r\nsweetness, delicacy, and flavour, to those in England, as a musk-melon\r\nis to the stock of a common cabbage. They are small and conical, of\r\na yellowish colour, with a very thin skin and, over and above their\r\nagreeable taste, are valuable for their antiscorbutic quality--As to the\r\nfruit now in season, such as cherries, gooseberries, and currants, there\r\nis no want of them at Edinburgh; and in the gardens of some gentlemen,\r\nwho live in the neighbourhood, there is now a very favourable appearance\r\nof apricots, peaches, nectarines, and even grapes: nay, I have seen\r\na very fine shew of pineapples within a few miles of this metropolis.\r\nIndeed, we have no reason to be surprised at these particulars, when we\r\nconsider how little difference there is, in fact, betwixt this climate\r\nand that of London.\r\n\r\nAll the remarkable places in the city and its avenues, for ten miles\r\naround, we have visited, much to our satisfaction. In the Castle are\r\nsome royal apartments, where the sovereign occasionally resided; and\r\nhere are carefully preserved the regalia of the kingdom, consisting of\r\na crown, said to be of great value, a sceptre, and a sword of state,\r\nadorned with jewels--Of these symbols of sovereignty, the people are\r\nexceedingly jealous--A report being spread during the sitting of the\r\nunion-parliament, that they were removed to London, such a tumult arose,\r\nthat the lord commissioner would have been torn to pieces, if he had not\r\nproduced them for the satisfaction of the populace.\r\n\r\nThe palace of Holyrood-house is an elegant piece of architecture, but\r\nsunk in an obscure, and, as I take it, unwholesome bottom, where\r\none would imagine it had been placed on purpose to be concealed. The\r\napartments are lofty, but unfurnished; and as for the pictures of\r\nthe Scottish kings, from Fergus I. to king William, they are paultry\r\ndaubings, mostly by the same hand, painted either from the imagination,\r\nor porters hired to sit for the purpose. All the diversions of London\r\nwe enjoy at Edinburgh, in a small compass. Here is a well\r\nconducted concert, in which several gentlemen perform on different\r\ninstruments--The Scots are all musicians--Every man you meet plays on\r\nthe flute, the violin, or violoncello; and there is one nobleman, whose\r\ncompositions are universally admired--Our company of actors is very\r\ntolerable; and a subscription is now on foot for building a new theatre;\r\nbut their assemblies please me above all other public exhibitions.\r\n\r\nWe have been at the hunters’ ball, where I was really astonished to see\r\nsuch a number of fine women--The English, who have never crossed the\r\nTweed, imagine erroneously, that the Scotch ladies are not remarkable\r\nfor personal attractions; but, I can declare with a safe conscience, I\r\nnever saw so many handsome females together, as were assembled on this\r\noccasion. At the Leith races, the best company comes hither from the\r\nremoter provinces; so that, I suppose, we had all the beauty of the\r\nkingdom concentrated as it were into one focus; which was, indeed, so\r\nvehement, that my heart could hardly resist its power. Between friends,\r\nit has sustained some damage from the bright eyes of the charming miss\r\nR[ento]n, whom I had the honour to dance with at the ball--The countess\r\nof Melville attracted all eyes, and the admiration of all present--She\r\nwas accompanied by the agreeable miss Grieve, who made many conquests;\r\nnor did my sister Liddy pass unnoticed in the assembly--She is become\r\na toast at Edinburgh, by the name of the Fair Cambrian, and has already\r\nbeen the occasion of much wine-shed; but the poor girl met with an\r\naccident at the ball, which has given us great disturbance.\r\n\r\nA young gentleman, the express image of that rascal Wilson, went up\r\nto ask her to dance a minuet; and his sudden appearance shocked her so\r\nmuch, that she fainted away--I call Wilson a rascal, because, if he had\r\nbeen really a gentleman, with honourable intentions, he would have,\r\nere now, appeared in his own character--I must own, my blood boils\r\nwith indignation when I think of that fellow’s presumption; and Heaven\r\nconfound me if I don’t--But I won’t be so womanish as to rail--Time\r\nwill, perhaps, furnish occasion--Thank God, the cause of Liddy’s\r\ndisorder remains a secret. The lady directress of the ball, thinking she\r\nwas overcome by the heat of the place, had her conveyed to another room,\r\nwhere she soon recovered so well, as to return and join in the country\r\ndances, in which the Scotch lasses acquit themselves with such spirit\r\nand agility, as put their partners to the height of their mettle. I\r\nbelieve our aunt, Mrs Tabitha, had entertained hopes of being able to\r\ndo some execution among the cavaliers at this assembly. She had been\r\nseveral days in consultation with milliners and mantua-makers, preparing\r\nfor the occasion, at which she made her appearance in a full suit of\r\ndamask, so thick and heavy, that the sight of it alone, at this season\r\nof the year, was sufficient to draw drops of sweat from any man\r\nof ordinary imagination--She danced one minuet with our friend Mr\r\nMitchelson, who favoured her so far, in the spirit of hospitality and\r\npoliteness; and she was called out a second time by the young laird of\r\nBallymawhawple, who, coming in by accident, could not readily find any\r\nother partner; but as the first was a married man, and the second payed\r\nno particular homage to her charms, which were also over-looked by the\r\nrest of the company, she became dissatisfied and censorious--At supper,\r\nshe observed that the Scotch gentlemen made a very good figure, when\r\nthey were a little improved by travelling; and therefore it was pity\r\nthey did not all take the benefit of going abroad. She said the women\r\nwere awkward, masculine creatures; that, in dancing, they lifted their\r\nlegs like so many colts; that they had no idea of graceful motion, and\r\nput on their clothes in a frightful manner; but if the truth must\r\nbe told, Tabby herself was the most ridiculous figure, and the worst\r\ndressed of the whole assembly. The neglect of the male sex rendered\r\nher malcontent and peevish; she now found fault with every thing at\r\nEdinburgh, and teized her brother to leave the place, when she was\r\nsuddenly reconciled to it on a religious consideration--There is a sect\r\nof fanaticks, who have separated themselves from the established kirk,\r\nunder the name of Seceders--They acknowledge no earthly head of the\r\nchurch, reject lay-patronage, and maintain the methodist doctrines of\r\nthe new birth, the new light, the efficacy of grace, the insufficiency\r\nof works, and the operations of the spirit. Mrs Tabitha, attended by\r\nHumphry Clinker, was introduced to one of their conventicles, where they\r\nboth received much edification; and she has had the good fortune to\r\ncome acquainted with a pious Christian, called Mr Moffat, who is very\r\npowerful in prayer, and often assists her in private exercises of\r\ndevotion.\r\n\r\nI never saw such a concourse of genteel company at any races in England,\r\nas appeared on the course of Leith--Hard by, in the fields called the\r\nLinks, the citizens of Edinburgh divert themselves at a game called\r\ngolf, in which they use a curious kind of bats, tipt with horn, and\r\nsmall elastic balls of leather, stuffed with feathers, rather less than\r\ntennis balls, but of a much harder consistence--This they strike with\r\nsuch force and dexterity from one hole to another, that they will fly\r\nto an incredible distance. Of this diversion the Scots are so fond, that\r\nwhen the weather will permit, you may see a multitude of all ranks,\r\nfrom the senator of justice to the lowest tradesman, mingled together in\r\ntheir shirts, and following the balls with the utmost eagerness. Among\r\nothers, I was shewn one particular set of golfers, the youngest of\r\nwhom was turned of fourscore--They were all gentlemen of independent\r\nfortunes, who had amused themselves with this pastime for the best part\r\nof a century, without having ever felt the least alarm from sickness or\r\ndisgust; and they never went to bed, without having each the best\r\npart of a gallon of claret in his belly. Such uninterrupted exercise,\r\nco-operating with the keen air from the sea, must, without all doubt,\r\nkeep the appetite always on edge, and steel the constitution against all\r\nthe common attacks of distemper.\r\n\r\nThe Leith races gave occasion to another entertainment of a very\r\nsingular nature--There is at Edinburgh a society or corporation of\r\nerrand-boys, called cawdies, who ply in the streets at night with paper\r\nlanthorns, and are very serviceable in carrying messages--These fellows,\r\nthough shabby in their appearance, and rudely familiar in their address,\r\nare wonderfully acute, and so noted for fidelity, that there is no\r\ninstance of [a] cawdy’s having betrayed his trust--Such is their\r\nintelligence, that they know, not only every individual of the place,\r\nbut also every stranger, by that time he has been four and twenty hours\r\nin Edinburgh; and no transaction, even the most private, can escape\r\ntheir notice. They are particularly famous for their dexterity in\r\nexecuting one of the functions of Mercury; though, for my own part, I\r\nnever employed them in this department of business--Had I occasion\r\nfor any service of this nature, my own man, Archy M’Alpine, is as well\r\nqualified as e’er a cawdie in Edinburgh; and I am much mistaken, if he\r\nhas not been heretofore of their fraternity. Be that as it may, they\r\nresolved to give a dinner and a ball at Leith, to which they formally\r\ninvited all the young noblemen and gentlemen that were at the races; and\r\nthis invitation was reinforced by an assurance that all the celebrated\r\nladies of pleasure would grace the entertainment with their company.--I\r\nreceived a card on this occasion, and went thither with half a dozen of\r\nmy acquaintance.--In a large hall the cloth was laid on a long range of\r\ntables joined together, and here the company seated themselves, to\r\nthe number of about fourscore, lords, and lairds, and other gentlemen,\r\ncourtezans and cawdies mingled together, as the slaves and their masters\r\nwere in the time of the Saturnalia in ancient Rome.--The toast master,\r\nwho sat at the upper end, was one Cawdie Fraser, a veteran pimp,\r\ndistinguished for his humour and sagacity, well known and much respected\r\nin his profession by all the guests, male and female, that were here\r\nassembled.--He had bespoke the dinner and the wine: he had taken care\r\nthat all his brethren should appear in decent apparel and clean\r\nlinen; and he himself wore a periwig with three tails in honour of the\r\nfestival.--I assure you the banquet was both elegant and plentiful,\r\nand seasoned with a thousand sallies, that promoted a general spirit\r\nof mirth and good humour.--After the desert, Mr Fraser proposed the\r\nfollowing toasts, which I don’t pretend to explain. ‘The best in\r\nChristendom.’--‘Gibbs’ contract.’--‘The beggar’s benison,’--‘King and\r\nkirk.’--‘Great Britain and Ireland.’ Then, filling a bumper, and turning\r\nto me, ‘Mester Malford (said he), may a’ unkindness cease betwixt John\r\nBull and his sister Moggy.’--The next person he singled out, was a\r\nnobleman who had been long abroad.--‘Ma lord (cried Fraser), here is a\r\nbumper to a’ those noblemen who have virtue enough to spend their rents\r\nin their ain countray.’--He afterwards addressed himself to a member of\r\nparliament in these words:--‘Meester--I’m sure ye’ll ha’ nae objection\r\nto my drinking, disgrace and dule to ilka Scot, that sells his\r\nconscience and his vote.’--He discharged a third sarcasm at a person\r\nvery gaily dressed, who had risen from small beginnings, and made a\r\nconsiderable fortune at play.--Filling his glass, and calling him by\r\nname, ‘Lang life (said he), to the wylie loon that gangs a-field with a\r\ntoom poke at his lunzie, and comes hame with a sackful of siller.’--All\r\nthese toasts being received with loud bursts of applause, Mr Fraser\r\ncalled for pint glasses, and filled his own to the brim: then standing\r\nup, and all his brethren following his example, ‘Ma lords and gentlemen\r\n(cried he), here is a cup of thanks for the great and undeserved honour\r\nyou have done your poor errand-boys this day.’--So saying, he and they\r\ndrank off their glasses in a trice, and quitting their seats, took their\r\nstation each behind one of the other guests; exclaiming, ‘Noo we’re your\r\nhonours cawdies again.’\r\n\r\nThe nobleman who had bore the first brunt of Mr Fraser’s satire,\r\nobjected to his abdication. He said, as the company was assembled by\r\ninvitation from the cawdies, he expected they were to be entertained at\r\ntheir expense. ‘By no means, my lord (cried Fraser), I wad na he guilty\r\nof sic presumption for the wide warld--I never affronted a gentleman\r\nsince I was born; and sure at this age I wonnot offer an indignity to\r\nsic an honourable convention.’ ‘Well (said his Lordship) as you have\r\nexpended some wit, you have a right to save your money. You have given\r\nme good counsel, and I take it in good part. As you have voluntarily\r\nquitted your seat, I will take your place with the leave of the good\r\ncompany, and think myself happy to be hailed, Father of the Feast.’ He\r\nwas forthwith elected into the chair, and complimented in a bumper in\r\nhis new character.\r\n\r\nThe claret continued to circulate without interruption, till the glasses\r\nseemed to dance upon the table, and this, perhaps, was a hint to the\r\nladies to call for music--At eight in the evening the ball began in\r\nanother apartment: at midnight we went to supper; but it was broad day\r\nbefore I found the way to my lodgings; and, no doubt, his Lordship had a\r\nswinging bill to discharge.\r\n\r\nIn short, I have lived so riotously for some weeks, that my uncle\r\nbegins to be alarmed on the score of my constitution, and very seriously\r\nobserves, ‘that all his own infirmities are owing to such excesses\r\nindulged in his youth--Mrs Tabitha says it would be more to the\r\nadvantage of my soul as well as body, if, instead of frequenting these\r\nscenes of debauchery, I would accompany Mr Moffat and her to hear a\r\nsermon of the reverend Mr M’Corkindale.--Clinker often exhorts me, with\r\na groan, to take care of my precious health; and even Archy M’Alpine,\r\nwhen he happens to be overtaken (which is oftener the case than I could\r\nwish), reads me a long lecture upon temperance and sobriety; and is\r\nso very wise and sententious, that, if I could provide him with\r\na professor’s chair, I would willingly give up the benefit of his\r\namonitions and service together; for I was tutor-sick at alma mater.\r\n\r\nI am not, however, so much engrossed by the gaieties of Edinburgh, but\r\nthat I find time to make parties in the family way. We have not only\r\nseen all the villas and villages within ten miles of the capital, but\r\nwe have also crossed the Firth, which is an arm of the sea seven miles\r\nbroad, that divides Lothian from the shire, or, as the Scots call it,\r\nthe kingdom of Fife. There is a number of large open sea-boats that ply\r\non this passage from Leith to Kinghorn, which is a borough on the\r\nother side. In one of these our whole family embarked three days ago,\r\nexcepting my sister, who, being exceedingly fearful of the water, was\r\nleft to the care of Mrs Mitchelson. We had an easy and quick passage\r\ninto Fife, where we visited a number of poor towns on the sea-side,\r\nincluding St Andrew’s, which is the skeleton of a venerable city; but we\r\nwere much better pleased with some noble and elegant seats and castles,\r\nof which there is a great number in that part of Scotland. Yesterday\r\nwe took boat again on our return to Leith, with fair wind and agreeable\r\nweather; but we had not advanced half-way when the sky was suddenly\r\novercast, and the wind changing, blew directly in our teeth so that we\r\nwere obliged to turn, or tack the rest of the way. In a word, the gale\r\nincreased to a storm of wind and rain, attended with such a fog, that\r\nwe could not see the town of Leith, to which we were bound, nor even the\r\ncastle of Edinburgh, notwithstanding its high situation. It is not to be\r\ndoubted but that we were all alarmed on this occasion. And at the same\r\ntime, most of the passengers were seized with a nausea that produced\r\nviolent retchings. My aunt desired her brother to order the boatmen, to\r\nput back to Kinghorn, and this expedient he actually proposed; but they\r\nassured him there was no danger. Mrs Tabitha finding them obstinate,\r\nbegan to scold, and insisted upon my uncle’s exerting his authority as\r\na justice of the peace. Sick and peevish as he was, he could not help\r\nlaughing at this wise proposal, telling her, that his commission did not\r\nextend so far, and, if it did, he should let the people take their own\r\nway; for he thought it would be great presumption in him to direct them\r\nin the exercise of their own profession. Mrs Winifred Jenkins made a\r\ngeneral clearance with the assistance of Mr Humphry Clinker, who joined\r\nher both in prayer and ejaculation.--As he took it for granted that we\r\nshould not be long in this world, he offered some spiritual consolation\r\nto Mrs Tabitha, who rejected it with great disgust, bidding him keep his\r\nsermons for those who had leisure to hear such nonsense.--My uncle sat,\r\ncollected in himself, without speaking; my man Archy had recourse to a\r\nbrandy-bottle, with which he made so free, that I imagined he had sworn\r\nto die of drinking any thing rather than sea-water: but the brandy had\r\nno more effect upon him in the way of intoxication, than if it had been\r\nsea-water in good earnest.--As for myself, I was too much engrossed by\r\nthe sickness at my stomach, to think of any thing else. Meanwhile the\r\nsea swelled mountains high, the boat pitched with such violence, as if\r\nit had been going to pieces; the cordage rattled, the wind roared; the\r\nlightning flashed, the thunder bellowed, and the rain descended in\r\na deluge--Every time the vessel was put about, we ship’d a sea that\r\ndrenched us all to the skin.--When, by dint of turning, we thought to\r\nhave cleared the pier head, we were driven to leeward, and then the\r\nboatmen themselves began to fear that the tide would fail before we\r\nshould fetch up our lee-way: the next trip, however, brought us into\r\nsmooth water, and we were safely landed on the quay, about one o’clock\r\nin the afternoon.--‘To be sure (cried Tabby, when she found herself\r\non terra firma), we must all have perished, if we had not been the\r\nparticular care of Providence.’ ‘Yes (replied my uncle), but I am much\r\nof the honest highlander’s mind--after he had made such a passage\r\nas this: his friend told him he was much indebted to\r\nProvidence;--“Certainly (said Donald), but, by my saul, mon, I’se ne’er\r\ntrouble Providence again, so long as the brig of Stirling stands.”’--You\r\nmust know the brig, or bridge of Stirling, stands above twenty miles\r\nup the river Forth, of which this is the outlet--I don’t find that our\r\n‘squire has suffered in his health from this adventure; but poor Liddy\r\nis in a peaking way--I’m afraid this unfortunate girl is uneasy in her\r\nmind; and this apprehension distracts me, for she is really an amiable\r\ncreature.\r\n\r\nWe shall set out to-morrow or next day for Stirling and Glasgow; and we\r\npropose to penetrate a little way into the Highlands, before we turn our\r\ncourse to the southward--In the mean time, commend me to all our friends\r\nround Carfax, and believe me to be, ever yours,\r\n\r\nEDINBURGH, Aug. 8. J. MELFORD\r\n\nTo Dr LEWIS.\r\n\r\nI should be very ungrateful, dear Lewis, if I did not find myself\r\ndisposed to think and speak favourably of this people, among whom I have\r\nmet with more kindness, hospitality, and rational entertainment, in a\r\nfew weeks, than ever I received in any other country during the whole\r\ncourse of my life.--Perhaps, the gratitude excited by these benefits may\r\ninterfere with the impartiality of my remarks; for a man is as apt to\r\nbe prepossessed by particular favours as to be prejudiced by private\r\nmotives of disgust. If I am partial, there is, at least, some merit\r\nin my conversion from illiberal prejudices which had grown up with my\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nThe first impressions which an Englishman receives in this country, will\r\nnot contribute to the removal of his prejudices; because he refers every\r\nthing he sees to a comparison with the same articles in his own country;\r\nand this comparison is unfavourable to Scotland in all its exteriors,\r\nsuch as the face of the country in respect to cultivation, the\r\nappearance of the bulk of the people, and the language of conversation\r\nin general.--I am not so far convinced by Mr Lismahago’s arguments, but\r\nthat I think the Scots would do well, for their own sakes, to adopt\r\nthe English idioms and pronunciation; those of them especially, who are\r\nresolved to push their fortunes in South-Britain--I know, by experience,\r\nhow easily an Englishman is influenced by the ear, and how apt he is\r\nto laugh, when he hears his own language spoken with a foreign or\r\nprovincial accent--I have known a member of the house of commons speak\r\nwith great energy and precision, without being able to engage attention,\r\nbecause his observations were made in the Scotch dialect, which (no\r\noffence to lieutenant Lismahago) certainly gives a clownish air even\r\nto sentiments of the greatest dignity and decorum.--I have declared my\r\nopinion on this head to some of the most sensible men of this country,\r\nobserving, at the same time, that if they would employ a few natives of\r\nEngland to teach the pronunciation of our vernacular tongue, in twenty\r\nyears there would be no difference, in point of dialect, between the\r\nyouth of Edinburgh and of London.\r\n\r\nThe civil regulations of this kingdom and metropolis are taken from\r\nvery different models from those of England, except in a few particular\r\nestablishments, the necessary consequences of the union.--Their college\r\nof justice is a bench of great dignity, filled with judges of character\r\nand ability.--I have heard some causes tried before this venerable\r\ntribunal; and was very much pleased with the pleadings of their\r\nadvocates, who are by no means deficient either in argument or\r\nelocution. The Scottish legislation is founded, in a great measure, on\r\nthe civil law; consequently, their proceedings vary from those of the\r\nEnglish tribunals; but, I think, they have the advantage of us in their\r\nmethod of examining witnesses apart, and in the constitution of their\r\njury, by which they certainly avoid the evil which I mentioned in my\r\nlast from Lismahago’s observation.\r\n\r\nThe university of Edinburgh is supplied with excellent professors in all\r\nthe sciences; and the medical school, in particular, is famous all over\r\nEurope.--The students of this art have the best opportunity of learning\r\nit to perfection, in all its branches, as there are different courses\r\nfor the theory of medicine and the practice of medicine; for anatomy,\r\nchemistry, botany, and the materia medica, over and above those of\r\nmathematics and experimental philosophy; and all these are given by men\r\nof distinguished talents. What renders this part of education still more\r\ncomplete, is the advantage of attending the infirmary, which is the best\r\ninstituted charitable foundation that I ever knew. Now we are talking\r\nof charities, here are several hospitals, exceedingly well endowed, and\r\nmaintained under admirable regulations; and these are not only useful,\r\nbut ornamental to the city. Among these, I shall only mention the\r\ngeneral work-house, in which all the poor, not otherwise provided for,\r\nare employed, according to their different abilities, with such judgment\r\nand effect, that they nearly maintain themselves by their labour,\r\nand there is not a beggar to be seen within the precincts of this\r\nmetropolis. It was Glasgow that set the example of this establishment,\r\nabout thirty years ago.--Even the kirk of Scotland, so long reproached\r\nwith fanaticism and canting, abounds at present with ministers\r\ncelebrated for their learning, and respectable for their moderation.--I\r\nhave heard their sermons with equal astonishment and pleasure.--The good\r\npeople of Edinburgh no longer think dirt and cobwebs essential to the\r\nhouse of God.--Some of their churches have admitted such ornaments\r\nas would have excited sedition, even in England, a little more than a\r\ncentury ago; and Psalmody is here practised and taught by a professor\r\nfrom the cathedral of Durham:--I should not be surprised, in a few\r\nyears, to hear it accompanied with an organ.\r\n\r\nEdinburgh is a hot-bed of genius.--I have had the good fortune to be\r\nmade acquainted with many authors of the first distinction; such as the\r\ntwo Humes, Robertson, Smith, Wallace, Blair, Ferguson, Wilkie, &c. and I\r\nhave found them all as agreeable in conversation as they are instructive\r\nand entertaining in their writings. These acquaintances I owe to the\r\nfriendship of Dr Carlyle, who wants nothing but inclination to figure\r\nwith the rest upon paper. The magistracy of Edinburgh is changed every\r\nyear by election, and seems to be very well adapted both for state and\r\nauthority.--The lord provost is equal in dignity to the lord mayor\r\nof London; and the four bailies are equivalent to the rank of\r\naldermen.--There is a dean of guild, who takes cognizance of mercantile\r\naffairs; a treasurer; a town-clerk; and the council is composed\r\nof deacons, one of whom is returned every year, in rotation, as\r\nrepresentative of every company of artificers or handicraftsmen. Though\r\nthis city, from the nature of its situation, can never be made either\r\nvery convenient or very cleanly, it has, nevertheless, an air of\r\nmagnificence that commands respect.--The castle is an instance of the\r\nsublime in scite and architecture.--Its fortifications are kept in good\r\norder, and there is always in it a garrison of regular soldiers, which\r\nis relieved every year; but it is incapable of sustaining a siege\r\ncarried on according to the modern operations of war.--The castle hill,\r\nwhich extends from the outward gate to the upper end of the high street,\r\nis used as a public walk for the citizens, and commands a prospect,\r\nequally extensive and delightful, over the county of Fife, on the other\r\nside of the Frith, and all along the sea-coast, which is covered with a\r\nsuccession of towns that would seem to indicate a considerable share of\r\ncommerce; but, if the truth must be told, these towns have been falling\r\nto decay ever since the union, by which the Scots were in a\r\ngreat measure deprived of their trade with France.--The palace of\r\nHolyrood-house is a jewel in architecture, thrust into a hollow where\r\nit cannot be seen; a situation which was certainly not chosen by the\r\ningenious architect, who must have been confined to the site of the old\r\npalace, which was a convent. Edinburgh is considerably extended on the\r\nsouth side, where there are divers little elegant squares built in the\r\nEnglish manner; and the citizens have planned some improvements on the\r\nnorth, which, when put in execution, will add greatly to the beauty and\r\nconvenience of this capital.\r\n\r\nThe sea-port is Leith, a flourishing town, about a mile from the city,\r\nin the harbour of which I have seen above one hundred ships lying all\r\ntogether. You must know, I had the curiosity to cross the Frith in a\r\npassage boat, and stayed two days in Fife, which is remarkably fruitful\r\nin corn, and exhibits a surprising number of fine seats, elegantly\r\nbuilt, and magnificently furnished. There is an incredible number of\r\nnoble houses in every part of Scotland that I have seen.--Dalkeith,\r\nPinkie, Yester, and lord Hopton’s [Hopetoun’s], all of them within four\r\nor five miles of Edinburgh, are princely palaces, in every one of which\r\na sovereign might reside at his ease.--I suppose the Scots affect these\r\nmonuments of grandeur.--If I may be allowed to mingle censure with my\r\nremarks upon a people I revere, I must observe, that their weak side\r\nseems to be vanity.--I am afraid that even their hospitality is not\r\nquite free of ostentation. I think I have discovered among them uncommon\r\npains taken to display their fine linen, of which, indeed, they have\r\ngreat plenty, their furniture, plate, housekeeping, and variety of\r\nwines, in which article, it must be owned, they are profuse, if not\r\nprodigal--A burgher of Edinburgh, not content to vie with a citizen of\r\nLondon, who has ten times his fortune, must excel him in the expence as\r\nwell as elegance of his entertainments.\r\n\r\nThough the villas of the Scotch nobility and gentry have generally\r\nan air of grandeur and state, I think their gardens and parks are not\r\ncomparable to those of England; a circumstance the more remarkable, as I\r\nwas told by the ingenious Mr Phillip Miller of Chelsea, that almost all\r\nthe gardeners of South-Britain were natives of Scotland. The verdure of\r\nthis country is not equal to that of England.--The pleasure-grounds are,\r\nin my opinion, not so well laid out according to the genius loci; nor\r\nare the lawns, and walks, and hedges kept in such delicate order.--The\r\ntrees are planted in prudish rows, which have not such an agreeable\r\nnatural effect, as when they are thrown into irregular groupes, with\r\nintervening glades; and firs, which they generally raise around their\r\nhouses, look dull and funereal in the summer season.--I must confess,\r\nindeed, that they yield serviceable timber, and good shelter against the\r\nnorthern blasts; that they grow and thrive in the most barren soil, and\r\ncontinually perspire a fine balsam of turpentine, which must render the\r\nair very salutary and sanative to lungs of a tender texture.\r\n\r\nTabby and I have been both frightened in our return by sea from the\r\ncoast of Fife--She was afraid of drowning, and I of catching cold, in\r\nconsequence of being drenched with sea-water; but my fears as well as\r\nhers, have been happily disappointed. She is now in perfect health; I\r\nwish I could say the same of Liddy--Something uncommon is the matter\r\nwith that poor girl; her colour fades, her appetite fails, and her\r\nspirits flag--She is become moping and melancholy, and is often found\r\nin tears--Her brother suspects internal uneasiness on account of Wilson,\r\nand denounces vengeance against that adventurer.--She was, it seems,\r\nstrongly affected at the ball by the sudden appearance of one Mr Gordon,\r\nwho strongly resembles the said Wilson; but I am rather suspicious that\r\nshe caught cold by being overheated with dancing.--I have consulted Dr\r\nGregory, an eminent physician of an amiable character, who advises the\r\nhighland air, and the use of goat-milk whey, which, surely, cannot have\r\na bad effect upon a patient who was born and bred among the mountains of\r\nWales--The doctors opinion is the more agreeable, as we shall find those\r\nremedies in the very place which I proposed as the utmost extent of our\r\nexpedition--I mean the borders of Argyle.\r\n\r\nMr Smollett, one of the judges of the commissary court, which is now\r\nsitting, has very kindly insisted upon our lodging at his country-house,\r\non the banks of Lough-Lomond, about fourteen miles beyond Glasgow. For\r\nthis last city we shall set out in two days, and take Stirling in our\r\nway, well provided with recommendations from our friends at Edinburgh,\r\nwhom, I protest, I shall leave with much regret. I am so far from\r\nthinking it any hardship to live in this country, that, if I was obliged\r\nto lead a town life, Edinburgh would certainly be the headquarters of\r\n\nYours always, MATT. BRAMBLE EDIN., August 8.\r\n\nTo Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bart. of Jesus college, Oxon.\r\n\r\nDEAR KNIGHT,\r\n\r\nI am now little short of the Ultima Thule, if this appellation properly\r\nbelongs to the Orkneys or Hebrides. These last are now lying before me,\r\nto the amount of some hundreds, scattered up and down the Deucalidonian\r\nsea, affording the most picturesque and romantic prospect I ever\r\nbeheld--I write this letter in a gentleman’s house, near the town of\r\nInverary which may be deemed the capital of the West Highlands, famous\r\nfor nothing so much as for the stately castle begun, and actually\r\ncovered in by the late duke of Argyle, at a prodigious expence--Whether\r\nit will ever be completely finished is a question.--\r\n\r\nBut, to take things in order--We left Edinburgh ten days ago; and the\r\nfurther North we proceed, we find Mrs Tabitha the less manageable; so\r\nthat her inclinations are not of the nature of the loadstone; they point\r\nnot towards the pole. What made her leave Edinburgh with reluctance at\r\nlast, if we may believe her own assertions, was a dispute which she left\r\nunfinished with Mr Moffat, touching the eternity of hell torments. That\r\ngentleman, as he advanced in years, began to be sceptical on this head,\r\ntill, at length, he declared open war against the common acceptation of\r\nthe word eternal. He is now persuaded, that eternal signifies no more\r\nthan an indefinite number of years; and that the most enormous sinner\r\nmay be quit for nine millions, nine hundred thousand, nine hundred and\r\nninety-nine years of hell-fire; which term or period, as he very well\r\nobserves, forms but an inconsiderable drop, as it were, in the ocean of\r\neternity--For this mitigation he contends, as a system agreeable to the\r\nideas of goodness and mercy, which we annex to the supreme Being--Our\r\naunt seemed willing to adopt this doctrine in favour of the wicked; but\r\nhe hinted that no person whatever was so righteous as to be exempted\r\nentirely from punishment in a future state; and that the most pious\r\nChristian upon earth might think himself very happy to get off for\r\na fast of seven or eight thousand years in the midst of fire and\r\nbrimstone. Mrs Tabitha revolted at this dogma, which filled her at once\r\nwith horror and indignation--She had recourse to the opinion of Humphry\r\nClinker, who roundly declared it was the popish doctrine of purgatory,\r\nand quoted scripture in defence of the fire everlasting, prepared for\r\nthe devil and his angels--The reverend master Mackcorkendal, and all the\r\ntheologists and saints of that persuasion were consulted, and some of\r\nthem had doubts about the matter; which doubts and scruples had begun to\r\ninfect our aunt, when we took our departure from Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nWe passed through Linlithgow, where there was an elegant royal palace,\r\nwhich is now gone to decay, as well as the town itself--This too is\r\npretty much the case with Stirling, though it still boasts of a fine\r\nold castle in which the kings of Scotland were wont to reside in their\r\nminority--But Glasgow is the pride of Scotland, and, indeed, it might\r\nvery well pass for an elegant and flourishing city in any part of\r\nChristendom. There we had the good fortune to be received into the house\r\nof Mr Moore, an eminent surgeon, to whom we were recommended by one of\r\nour friends at Edinburgh; and, truly, he could not have done us more\r\nessential service--Mr Moore is a merry facetious companion, sensible and\r\nshrewd, with a considerable fund of humour; and his wife an agreeable\r\nwoman, well bred, kind, and obliging. Kindness, which I take to be\r\nthe essence of good-nature and humanity, is the distinguishing\r\ncharacteristic of the Scotch ladies in their own country--Our landlord\r\nshewed us every thing, and introduced us to all the world at Glasgow;\r\nwhere, through his recommendation, we were complimented with the freedom\r\nof the town. Considering the trade and opulence of this place, it cannot\r\nbut abound with gaiety and diversions. Here is a great number of young\r\nfellows that rival the youth of the capital in spirit and expence; and\r\nI was soon convinced, that all the female beauties of Scotland were\r\nnot assembled at the hunters ball in Edinburgh--The town of Glasgow\r\nflourishes in learning as well as in commerce--Here is an university,\r\nwith professors in all the different branches of science, liberally\r\nendowed, and judiciously chosen--It was vacation time when I passed,\r\nso that I could not entirely satisfy my curiosity; but their mode of\r\neducation is certainly preferable to ours in some respects. The students\r\nare not left to the private instruction of tutors; but taught in public\r\nschools or classes, each science by its particular professor or regent.\r\n\r\nMy uncle is in raptures with Glasgow--He not only visited all the\r\nmanufactures of the place, but made excursions all round to Hamilton,\r\nPaisley, Renfrew, and every other place within a dozen miles, where\r\nthere was any thing remarkable to be seen in art or nature. I believe\r\nthe exercise, occasioned by those jaunts, was of service to my sister\r\nLiddy, whose appetite and spirits begin to revive--Mrs Tabitha displayed\r\nher attractions as usual, and actually believed she had entangled one\r\nMr Maclellan, a rich inkle-manufacturer, in her snares; but when matters\r\ncame to an explanation, it appeared that his attachment was altogether\r\nspiritual, founded upon an intercourse of devotion, at the meeting of\r\nMr John Wesley; who, in the course of his evangelical mission, had come\r\nhither in person--At length, we set out for the banks of Lough-Lomond,\r\npassing through the little borough of Dumbarton, or (as my uncle will\r\nhave it) Dunbritton, where there is a castle, more curious than any\r\nthing of the kind I had ever seen. It is honoured with a particular\r\ndescription by the elegant Buchanan, as an arx inexpugnabilis,\r\nand, indeed, it must have been impregnable by the antient manner of\r\nbesieging. It is a rock of considerable extent, rising with a double\r\ntop, in an angle formed by the confluence of two rivers, the Clyde and\r\nthe Leven; perpendicular and inaccessible on all sides, except in one\r\nplace where the entrance is fortified; and there is no rising ground\r\nin the neighbourhood from whence it could be damaged by any kind of\r\nbattery.\r\n\r\nFrom Dumbarton, the West Highlands appear in the form of huge, dusky\r\nmountains, piled one over another; but this prospect is not at all\r\nsurprising to a native of Glamorgan--We have fixed our headquarters\r\nat Cameron, a very neat country-house belonging to commissary Smollet,\r\nwhere we found every sort of accommodation we could desire--It is\r\nsituated like a Druid’s temple, in a grove of oak, close by the side\r\nof Lough-Lomond, which is a surprising body of pure transparent water,\r\nunfathomably deep in many places, six or seven miles broad, four and\r\ntwenty miles in length, displaying above twenty green islands, covered\r\nwith wood; some of them cultivated for corn, and many of them stocked\r\nwith red deer--They belong to different gentlemen, whose seats are\r\nscattered along the banks of the lake, which are agreeably romantic\r\nbeyond all conception. My uncle and I have left the women at Cameron, as\r\nMrs Tabitha would by no means trust herself again upon the water, and\r\nto come hither it was necessary to cross a small inlet of the sea, in an\r\nopen ferry-boat--This country appears more and more wild and savage the\r\nfurther we advance; and the People are as different from the Low-land\r\nScots, in their looks, garb, and language, as the mountaineers of\r\nBrecknock are from the inhabitants of Herefordshire.\r\n\r\nWhen the Lowlanders want to drink a chearupping-cup, they go to the\r\npublic house, called the Change-house, and call for a chopine of\r\ntwo-penny, which is a thin, yeasty beverage, made of malt; not quite so\r\nstrong as the table-beer of England,--This is brought in a pewter stoop,\r\nshaped like a skittle, from whence it is emptied into a quaff; that is,\r\na curious cup made of different pieces of wood, such as box and ebony,\r\ncut into little staves, joined alternately, and secured with delicate\r\nhoops, having two cars or handles--It holds about a gill, is sometimes\r\ntipt round the mouth with silver, and has a plate of the same metal at\r\nbottom, with the landlord’s cypher engraved.--The Highlanders, on the\r\ncontrary, despise this liquor, and regale themselves with whisky; a malt\r\nspirit, as strong as geneva, which they swallow in great quantities,\r\nwithout any signs of inebriation. They are used to it from the cradle,\r\nand find it an excellent preservative against the winter cold, which\r\nmust be extreme on these mountains--I am told that it is given with\r\ngreat success to infants, as a cordial in the confluent smallpox, when\r\nthe eruption seems to flag, and the symptoms grow unfavourable--The\r\nHighlanders are used to eat much more animal food than falls to the\r\nshare of their neighbours in the Low-country--They delight in hunting;\r\nhave plenty of deer and other game, with a great number of sheep,\r\ngoats, and black-cattle running wild, which they scruple not to kill as\r\nvension, without being much at pains to ascertain the property.\r\n\r\nInverary is but a poor town, though it stands immediately under the\r\nprotection of the duke of Argyle, who is a mighty prince in this part of\r\nScotland. The peasants live in wretched cabins, and seem very poor; but\r\nthe gentlemen are tolerably well lodged, and so loving to strangers,\r\nthat a man runs some risque of his life from their hospitality--It must\r\nbe observed that the poor Highlanders are now seen to disadvantage. They\r\nhave been not only disarmed by act of parliament, but also deprived of\r\ntheir ancient garb, which was both graceful and convenient; and what\r\nis a greater hardship still, they are compelled to wear breeches; a\r\nrestraint which they cannot bear with any degree of patience: indeed,\r\nthe majority wear them, not in the proper place, but on poles or long\r\nstaves over their shoulders--They are even debarred the use of their\r\nstriped stuff called Tartane, which was their own manufacture, prized\r\nby them above all the velvets, brocades, and tissues of Europe and Asia.\r\nThey now lounge along in loose great coats, of coarse russet, equally\r\nmean and cumbersome, and betray manifest marks of dejection--Certain it\r\nis, the government could not have taken a more effectual method to break\r\ntheir national spirit.\r\n\r\nWe have had princely sport in hunting the stag on these mountains. These\r\nare the lonely hills of Morven, where Fingal and his heroes enjoyed the\r\nsame pastime; I feel an enthusiastic pleasure when I survey the brown\r\nheath that Ossian wont to tread; and hear the wind whistle through\r\nthe bending grass--When I enter our landlord’s hall, I look for the\r\nsuspended harp of that divine bard, and listen in hopes of hearing the\r\naerial sound of his respected spirit--The poems of Ossian are in every\r\nmouth--A famous antiquarian of this country, the laird of Macfarlane, at\r\nwhose house we dined a few days ago, can repeat them all in the original\r\nGallick, which has a great affinity to the Welch, not only in the\r\ngeneral sound, but also in a great number of radical words; and I make\r\nno doubt that they are both sprung from the same origin. I was not a\r\nlittle surprised, when asking a Highlander one day, if he knew where we\r\nshould find any game? he replied, ‘hu niel Sassenagh’, which signifies\r\nno English: the very same answer I should have received from a Welchman,\r\nand almost in the same words. The Highlanders have no other name for\r\nthe people of the Low-country, but Sassenagh, or Saxons; a strong\r\npresumption, that the Lowland Scots and the English are derived from the\r\nsame stock--The peasants of these hills strongly resemble those of Wales\r\nin their looks, their manners, and habitations; every thing I see, and\r\nhear, and feel, seems Welch--The mountains, vales, and streams; the\r\nair and climate; the beef, mutton, and game, are all Welch--It must be\r\nowned, however, that this people are better Provided than we in some\r\narticles--They have plenty of red deer and roebuck, which are fat\r\nand delicious at this season of the year. Their sea teems with amazing\r\nquantities of the finest fish in the world, and they find means to\r\nprocure very good claret at a very small expence.\r\n\r\nOur landlord is a man of consequence in this part of the country; a\r\ncadet from the family of Argyle and hereditary captain of one of his\r\ncastles--His name, in plain English, is Dougal Campbell; but as there is\r\na great number of the same appellation, they are distinguished (like\r\nthe Welch) by patronimics; and as I have known an antient Briton called\r\nMadoc ap-Morgan ap-Jenkin, ap-Jones, our Highland chief designs himself\r\nDou’l Mac-amish mac-’oul ichian, signifying Dougal, the son of James,\r\nthe son of Dougal, the son of John. He has travelled in the course\r\nof his education, and is disposed to make certain alterations in his\r\ndomestic oeconomy; but he finds it impossible to abolish the ancient\r\ncustoms of the family; some of which are ludicrous enough--His piper for\r\nexample, who is an hereditary officer of the household, will not part\r\nwith the least particle of his privileges. He has a right to wear the\r\nkilt, or ancient Highland dress, with the purse, pistol, and durk--a\r\nbroad yellow ribbon, fixed to the chanter-pipe, is thrown over his\r\nshoulder, and trails along the ground, while he performs the function of\r\nhis minstrelsy; and this, I suppose, is analogous to the pennon or flag\r\nwhich was formerly carried before every knight in battle.--He plays\r\nbefore the laird every Sunday in his way to the kirk, which he circles\r\nthree times, performing the family march which implies defiance to all\r\nthe enemies of the clan; and every morning he plays a full hour by the\r\nclock, in the great hall, marching backwards and forwards all the time,\r\nwith a solemn pace, attended by the laird’s kinsmen, who seem much\r\ndelighted with the music--In this exercise, he indulges them with a\r\nvariety of pibrochs or airs, suited to the different passions, which he\r\nwould either excite or assuage.\r\n\r\nMr Campbell himself, who performs very well on the violin, has an\r\ninvincible antipathy to the sound of the Highland bagpipe, which\r\nsings in the nose with a most alarming twang, and, indeed, is quite\r\nintolerable to ears of common sensibility, when aggravated by the echo\r\nof a vaulted hall--He therefore begged the piper would have some\r\nmercy upon him, and dispense with this part of the morning service--A\r\nconsultation of the clan being held on this occasion, it was unanimously\r\nagreed, that the laird’s request could not be granted without a\r\ndangerous encroachment upon the customs of the family--The piper\r\ndeclared, he could not give up for a moment the privilege he derived\r\nfrom his ancestors; nor would the laird’s relations forego an\r\nentertainment which they valued above all others--There was no remedy;\r\nMr Campbell, being obliged to acquiesce, is fain to stop his ears with\r\ncotton; to fortify his head with three or four night-caps and every\r\nmorning retire into the penetralia of his habitation, in order to avoid\r\nthis diurnal annoyance. When the music ceases, he produces himself at an\r\nopen window that looks into the courtyard, which is by this time filled\r\nwith a crowd of his vassals and dependents, who worship his first\r\nappearance, by uncovering their heads, and bowing to the earth with\r\nthe most humble prostration. As all these people have something to\r\ncommunicate in the way of proposal, complaint, or petition, they wait\r\npatiently till the laird comes forth, and, following him in his walks,\r\nare favoured each with a short audience in his turn. Two days ago, he\r\ndispatched above an hundred different sollicitors, in walking with us to\r\nthe house of a neighbouring gentleman, where we dined by invitation.\r\nOur landlord’s housekeeping is equally rough and hospitable, and savours\r\nmuch of the simplicity of ancient times: the great hall, paved with flat\r\nstones, is about forty-five feet by twenty-two, and serves not only for\r\na dining-room, but also for a bedchamber, to gentlemen-dependents and\r\nhangers-on of the family. At night, half a dozen occasional beds are\r\nranged on each side along the wall. These are made of fresh heath,\r\npulled up by the roots, and disposed in such a manner as to make a very\r\nagreeable couch, where they lie, without any other covering than the\r\nplaid--My uncle and I were indulged with separate chambers and down beds\r\nwhich we begged to exchange for a layer of heath; and indeed I never\r\nslept so much to my satisfaction. It was not only soft and elastic, but\r\nthe plant, being in flower, diffused an agreeable fragrance, which is\r\nwonderfully refreshing and restorative.\r\n\r\nYesterday we were invited to the funeral of an old lady, the grandmother\r\nof a gentleman in this neighbourhood, and found ourselves in the midst\r\nof fifty people, who were regaled with a sumptuous feast, accompanied by\r\nthe music of a dozen pipers. In short, this meeting had all the air of\r\na grand festival; and the guests did such honour to the entertainment,\r\nthat many of them could not stand when we were reminded of the business\r\non which we had met. The company forthwith taking horse, rode in a very\r\nirregular cavalcade to the place of interment, a church, at the distance\r\nof two long miles from the castle. On our arrival, however, we found\r\nwe had committed a small oversight, in leaving the corpse behind; so we\r\nwere obliged to wheel about, and met the old gentlewoman half way, being\r\ncarried upon poles by the nearest relations of her family, and attended\r\nby the coronach, composed of a multitude of old hags, who tore their\r\nhair, beat their breasts, and howled most hideously. At the grave, the\r\norator, or senachie, pronounced the panegyric of the defunct, every\r\nperiod being confirmed by a yell of the coronach. The body was committed\r\nto the earth, the pipers playing a pibroch all the time; and all the\r\ncompany standing uncovered. The ceremony was closed with the discharge\r\nof pistols; then we returned to the castle, resumed the bottle, and\r\nby midnight there was not a sober person in the family, the females\r\nexcepted. The ‘squire and I were, with some difficulty, permitted to\r\nretire with our landlord in the evening; but our entertainer was a\r\nlittle chagrined at our retreat; and afterwards seemed to think it a\r\ndisparagement to his family, that not above a hundred gallons of whisky\r\nhad been drunk upon such a solemn occasion. This morning we got up by\r\nfour, to hunt the roebuck, and, in half an hour, found breakfast ready\r\nserved in the hall. The hunters consisted of Sir George Colquhoun and\r\nme, as strangers (my uncle not chusing to be of the party), of the laird\r\nin person, the laird’s brother, the laird’s brother’s son, the laird’s\r\nsister’s son, the laird’s father’s brother’s son, and all their foster\r\nbrothers, who are counted parcel of the family: but we were attended by\r\nan infinite number of Gaelly’s, or ragged Highlanders without shoes or\r\nstockings.\r\n\r\nThe following articles formed our morning’s repast: one kit of boiled\r\neggs; a second, full of butter; a third full of cream; an entire cheese,\r\nmade of goat’s milk; a large earthen pot full of honey; the best part\r\nof a ham; a cold venison pasty; a bushel of oat meal, made in thin cakes\r\nand bannocks, with a small wheaten loaf in the middle for the strangers;\r\na large stone bottle full of whisky, another of brandy, and a kilderkin\r\nof ale. There was a ladle chained to the cream kit, with curious wooden\r\nbickers to be filled from this reservoir. The spirits were drank out of\r\na silver quaff, and the ale out of hems: great justice was done to the\r\ncollation by the guest in general; one of them in particular ate above\r\ntwo dozen of hard eggs, with a proportionable quantity of bread, butter,\r\nand honey; nor was one drop of liquor left upon the board. Finally,\r\na large roll of tobacco was presented by way of desert, and every\r\nindividual took a comfortable quid, to prevent the bad effects of the\r\nmorning air. We had a fine chace over the mountains, after a roebuck,\r\nwhich we killed, and I got home time enough to drink tea with Mrs\r\nCampbell and our ‘squire. To-morrow we shall set out on our return for\r\nCameron. We propose to cross the Frith of Clyde, and take the towns of\r\nGreenock and Port-Glasgow in our way. This circuit being finished, we\r\nshall turn our faces to the south, and follow the sun with augmented\r\nvelocity, in order to enjoy the rest of the autumn in England, where\r\nBoreas is not quite so biting as he begins already to be on the tops\r\nof these northern hills. But our progress from place to place shall\r\ncontinue to be specified in these detached journals of\r\n\r\nYours always, J. MELFORD ARGYLSHIRE, Sept. 3.\r\n\nTo Dr LEWIS.\r\n\r\nDEAR DICK,\r\n\r\nAbout a fortnight is now elapsed, since we left the capital of Scotland,\r\ndirecting our course towards Stirling, where we lay. The castle of this\r\nplace is such another as that of Edinburgh, and affords a surprising\r\nprospect of the windings of the river Forth, which are so extraordinary,\r\nthat the distance from hence to Alloa by land, is but forty miles, and\r\nby water it is twenty-four. Alloa is a neat thriving town, that depends\r\nin a great measure on the commerce of Glasgow, the merchants of which\r\nsend hither tobacco and other articles, to be deposited in warehouses\r\nfor exportation from the Frith of Forth. In our way hither we visited\r\na flourishing iron-work, where, instead of burning wood, they use coal,\r\nwhich they have the art of clearing in such a manner as frees it from\r\nthe sulphur, that would otherwise render the metal too brittle for\r\nworking. Excellent coal is found in almost every part of Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe soil of this district produces scarce any other grain but oats and\r\nbarley; perhaps because it is poorly cultivated, and almost altogether\r\nuninclosed. The few inclosures they have consist of paultry walls of\r\nloose stones gathered from the fields, which indeed they cover, as if\r\nthey had been scattered on purpose. When I expressed my surprize that\r\nthe peasants did not disencumber their grounds of these stones; a\r\ngentleman, well acquainted with the theory as well as practice of\r\nfarming, assured me that the stones, far from being prejudicial, were\r\nserviceable to the crop. This philosopher had ordered a field of his own\r\nto be cleared, manured and sown with barley, and the produce was more\r\nscanty than before. He caused the stones to be replaced, and next year\r\nthe crop was as good as ever. The stones were removed a second time,\r\nand the harvest failed; they were again brought back, and the ground\r\nretrieved its fertility. The same experiment has been tried in different\r\nparts of Scotland with the same success--Astonished at this information,\r\nI desired to know in what manner he accounted for this strange\r\nphenomenon; and he said there were three ways in which the stones\r\nmight be serviceable. They might possibly restrain an excess in the\r\nperspiration of the earth, analogous to colliquative sweats, by which\r\nthe human body is sometimes wasted and consumed. They might act as so\r\nmany fences to protect the tender blade from the piercing winds of the\r\nspring; or, by multiplying the reflexion of the sun, they might increase\r\nthe warmth, so as to mitigate the natural chilness of the soil\r\nand climate--But, surely this excessive perspiration might be more\r\neffectually checked by different kinds of manure, such as ashes, lime,\r\nchalk, or marl, of which last it seems there are many pits in this\r\nkingdom: as for the warmth, it would be much more equally obtained by\r\ninclosures; the cultivation would require less labour; and the ploughs,\r\nharrows, and horses, would not suffer half the damage which they now\r\nsustain.\r\n\r\nThese north-western parts are by no means fertile in corn. The ground is\r\nnaturally barren and moorish. The peasants are poorly lodged, meagre\r\nin their looks, mean in their apparel, and remarkably dirty. This last\r\nreproach they might easily wash off, by means of those lakes, rivers,\r\nand rivulets of pure water, with which they are so liberally supplied by\r\nnature. Agriculture cannot be expected to flourish where the farms are\r\nsmall, the leases short, and the husbandman begins upon a rack rent,\r\nwithout a sufficient stock to answer the purposes of improvement. The\r\ngranaries of Scotland are the banks of the Tweed, the counties of East\r\nand Mid-Lothian, the Carse of Gowrie, in Perthshire, equal in fertility\r\nto any part of England, and some tracts in Aberdeenshire and Murray,\r\nwhere I am told the harvest is more early than in Northumberland,\r\nalthough they lie above two degrees farther north. I have a strong\r\ncuriosity to visit many places beyond the Forth and the Tay, such as\r\nPerth, Dundee, Montrose, and Aberdeen, which are towns equally elegant\r\nand thriving; but the season is too far advanced to admit of this\r\naddition to my original plan.\r\n\r\nI am so far happy as to have seen Glasgow, which, to the best of my\r\nrecollection and judgment, is one of the prettiest towns in Europe; and,\r\nwithout all doubt, it is one of the most flourishing in Great Britain.\r\nIn short, it is a perfect bee-hive in point of industry. It stands\r\npartly on a gentle declivity; but the greatest part of it is in a plain,\r\nwatered by the river Clyde. The streets are straight, open, airy, and\r\nwell paved; and the houses lofty and well built of hewn stone. At the\r\nupper end of the town, there is a venerable cathedral, that may be\r\ncompared with York-minster or West-minster; and, about the middle of the\r\ndescent from this to the Cross, is the college, a respectable pile\r\nof building, with all manner of accommodation for the professors and\r\nstudents, including an elegant library, and a observatory well provided\r\nwith astronomical instruments. The number of inhabitants is said to\r\namount to thirty thousand; and marks of opulence and independency appear\r\nin every quarter of this commercial city, which, however, is not without\r\nits inconveniences and defects. The water of their public pumps is\r\ngenerally hard and brackish, an imperfection the less excusable, as\r\nthe river Clyde runs by their doors, in the lower part of the town; and\r\nthere are rivulets and springs above the cathedral, sufficient to fill a\r\nlarge reservoir with excellent water, which might be thence distributed\r\nto all the different parts of the city. It is of more consequence to\r\nconsult the health of the inhabitants in this article than to employ so\r\nmuch attention in beautifying their town with new streets, squares, and\r\nchurches. Another defect, not so easily remedied, is the shallowness\r\nof the river, which will not float vessels of any burthen within ten or\r\ntwelve miles of the city; so that the merchants are obliged to load and\r\nunload their ships at Greenock and Port-Glasgow, situated about fourteen\r\nmiles nearer the mouth of the Frith, where it is about two miles broad.\r\n\r\nThe people of Glasgow have a noble spirit of enterprise--Mr Moore, a\r\nsurgeon, to whom I was recommended from Edinburgh, introduced me to all\r\nthe principal merchants of the place. Here I became acquainted with\r\nMr Cochran, who may be stiled one of the sages of this kingdom. He was\r\nfirst magistrate at the time of the last rebellion. I sat as member\r\nwhen he was examined in the house of commons, upon which occasion Mr P--\r\nobserved he had never heard such a sensible evidence given at that bar.\r\nI was also introduced to Dr John Gordon, a patriot of a truly Roman\r\nspirit, who is the father of the linen manufacture in this place, and\r\nwas the great promoter of the city workhouse, infirmary, and other works\r\nof public utility. Had he lived in ancient Rome, he would have been\r\nhonoured with a statue at the public expence. I moreover conversed with\r\none Mr G--ssf--d, whom I take to be one of the greatest merchants in\r\nEurope. In the last war, he is said to have had at one time five and\r\ntwenty ships with their cargoes, his own property, and to have traded\r\nfor above half a million sterling a-year. The last war was a fortunate\r\nperiod for the commerce of Glasgow--The merchants, considering that\r\ntheir ships bound for America, launching out at once into the Atlantic\r\nby the north of Ireland, pursued a track very little frequented\r\nby privateers, resolved to insure one another, and saved a very\r\nconsiderable sum by this resolution, as few or none of their ships were\r\ntaken--You must know I have a sort of national attachment to this part\r\nof Scotland--The great church dedicated to St Mongah, the river Clyde,\r\nand other particulars that smack of our Welch language and customs,\r\ncontribute to flatter me with the notion, that these people are the\r\ndescendants of the Britons, who once possessed this country. Without\r\nall question, this was a Cumbrian kingdom: its capital was Dumbarton (a\r\ncorruption of Dunbritton) which still exists as a royal borough, at\r\nthe influx of the Clyde and Leven, ten miles below Glasgow. The same\r\nneighbourhood gave birth to St Patrick, the apostle of Ireland, at a\r\nplace where there is still a church and village, which retain his name.\r\nHard by are some vestiges of the famous Roman wall, built in the reign\r\nof Antonine, from the Clyde to the Forth, and fortified with castles, to\r\nrestrain the incursions of the Scots or Caledonians, who inhabited\r\nthe West-Highlands. In a line parallel to this wall, the merchants of\r\nGlasgow have determined to make a navigable canal betwixt the two Firths\r\nwhich will be of incredible advantage to their commerce, in transporting\r\nmerchandize from one side of the island to the other.\r\n\r\nFrom Glasgow we travelled along the Clyde, which is a delightful stream,\r\nadorned on both sides with villas, towns, and villages. Here is no want\r\nof groves, and meadows, and corn-fields interspersed; but on this side\r\nof Glasgow, there is little other grain than oats and barley; the first\r\nare much better, the last much worse, than those of the same species in\r\nEngland. I wonder, there is so little rye, which is a grain that will\r\nthrive in almost any soil; and it is still more surprising, that the\r\ncultivation of potatoes should be so much neglected in the Highlands,\r\nwhere the poor people have not meal enough to supply them with bread\r\nthrough the winter. On the other side of the river are the towns of\r\nPaisley and Renfrew. The first, from an inconsiderable village, is\r\nbecome one of the most flourishing places of the kingdom, enriched\r\nby the linen, cambrick, flowered lawn, and silk manufactures. It was\r\nformerly noted for a rich monastery of the monks of Clugny, who wrote\r\nthe famous Scoti-Chronicon, called The Black Book of Paisley. The old\r\nabbey still remains, converted into a dwelling-house, belonging to the\r\nearl of Dundonald. Renfrew is a pretty town, on the banks of Clyde,\r\ncapital of the shire, which was heretofore the patrimony of the Stuart\r\nfamily, and gave the title of baron to the king’s eldest son, which is\r\nstill assumed by the prince of Wales.\r\n\r\nThe Clyde we left a little on our left-hand at Dunbritton, where it\r\nwidens into an aestuary or frith, being augmented by the influx of the\r\nLeven. On this spot stands the castle formerly called Alcluyd, washed,\r\nby these two rivers on all sides, except a narrow isthmus, which at\r\nevery spring-tide is overflowed. The whole is a great curiosity, from\r\nthe quality and form of the rock, as well as from the nature of its\r\nsituation--We now crossed the water of Leven, which, though nothing near\r\nso considerable as the Clyde, is much more transparent, pastoral, and\r\ndelightful. This charming stream is the outlet of Lough-Lomond, and\r\nthrough a tract of four miles pursues its winding course, murmuring over\r\na bed of pebbles, till it joins the Frith at Dunbritton. A very little\r\nabove its source, on the lake, stands the house of Cameron, belonging to\r\nMr Smollett, so embosomed in an oak wood, that we did not see it till\r\nwe were within fifty yards of the door. I have seen the Lago di Garda,\r\nAlbano, De Vico, Bolsena, and Geneva, and, upon my honour, I prefer\r\nLough-Lomond to them all, a preference which is certainly owing to the\r\nverdant islands that seem to float upon its surface, affording the most\r\ninchanting objects of repose to the excursive view. Nor are the banks\r\ndestitute of beauties, which even partake of the sublime. On this side\r\nthey display a sweet variety of woodland, cornfield, and pasture, with\r\nseveral agreeable villas emerging as it were out of the lake, till, at\r\nsome distance, the prospect terminates in huge mountains covered with\r\nheath, which being in the bloom, affords a very rich covering of purple.\r\nEvery thing here is romantic beyond imagination. This country is justly\r\nstiled the Arcadia of Scotland; and I don’t doubt but it may vie with\r\nArcadia in every thing but climate.--I am sure it excels it in verdure,\r\nwood, and water.--What say you to a natural bason of pure water, near\r\nthirty miles long, and in some places seven miles broad, and in many\r\nabove a hundred fathom deep, having four and twenty habitable islands,\r\nsome of them stocked with deer, and all of them covered with wood;\r\ncontaining immense quantities of delicious fish, salmon, pike, trout,\r\nperch, flounders, eels, and powans, the last a delicate kind of\r\nfresh-water herring peculiar to this lake; and finally communicating\r\nwith the sea, by sending off the Leven, through which all those species\r\n(except the powan) make their exit and entrance occasionally?\r\n\r\nInclosed I send you the copy of a little ode to this river, by Dr\r\nSmollett, who was born on the banks of it, within two miles of the\r\nplace where I am now writing.--It is at least picturesque and accurately\r\ndescriptive, if it has no other merit.--There is an idea of truth in an\r\nagreeable landscape taken from nature, which pleases me more than the\r\ngayest fiction which the most luxuriant fancy can display.\r\n\r\nI have other remarks to make; but as my paper is full, I must reserve\r\nthem till the next occasion. I shall only observe at present, that I am\r\ndetermined to penetrate at least forty miles into the Highlands, which\r\nnow appear like a vast fantastic vision in the clouds, inviting the\r\napproach of\r\n\r\nYours always, MATT. BRAMBLE CAMERON, Aug. 28.\r\n\r\nODE TO LEVEN-WATER\r\n\r\nOn Leven’s banks, while free to rove, And tune the rural pipe to love; I\r\nenvied not the happiest swain That ever trod th’ Arcadian plain.\r\n\r\nPure stream! in whose transparent wave My youthful limbs I wont to\r\nlave; No torrents stain thy limpid source; No rocks impede thy dimpling\r\ncourse, That sweetly warbles o’er its bed, With white, round, polish’d\r\npebbles spread; While, lightly pois’d, the scaly brood In myriads cleave\r\nthy crystal flood; The springing trout in speckled pride; The salmon,\r\nmonarch of the tide; The ruthless pike, intent on war; The silver eel,\r\nand motled par.*\r\n\r\nDevolving from thy parent lake, A charming maze thy waters make, By\r\nbow’rs of birch, and groves of pine, And hedges flow’r’d with eglantine.\r\n\r\nStill on thy banks so gayly green, May num’rous herds and flocks be\r\nseen, And lasses chanting o’er the pail, And shepherds piping in the\r\ndale, And ancient faith that knows no guile, And industry imbrown’d with\r\ntoil, And hearts resolv’d, and hands prepar’d, The blessings they enjoy\r\nto guard.\r\n\r\n * The par is a small fish, not unlike the smelt, which it\r\n rivals in delicacy and flavour.\r\n\nTo Dr LEWIS.\r\n\r\nDEAR DOCTOR,\r\n\r\nIf I was disposed to be critical, I should say this house of Cameron is\r\ntoo near the lake, which approaches, on one side, to within six or seven\r\nyards of the window. It might have been placed in a higher site, which\r\nwould have afforded a more extensive prospect and a drier atmosphere;\r\nbut this imperfection is not chargeable on the present proprietor, who\r\npurchased it ready built, rather than be at the trouble of repairing his\r\nown family-house of Bonhill, which stands two miles from hence on the\r\nLeven, so surrounded with plantation, that it used to be known by the\r\nname of the Mavis (or thrush) Nest. Above that house is a romantic glen\r\nor clift of a mountain, covered with hanging woods having at bottom a\r\nstream of fine water that forms a number of cascades in its descent to\r\njoin the Leven; so that the scene is quite enchanting. A captain of a\r\nman of war, who had made the circuit of the globe with Mr Anson, being\r\nconducted to this glen, exclaimed, ‘Juan Fernandez, by God!’\r\n\r\nIndeed, this country would be a perfect paradise, if it was not, like\r\nWales, cursed with a weeping climate, owing to the same cause in both,\r\nthe neighbourhood of high mountains, and a westerly situation, exposed\r\nto the vapours of the Atlantic ocean. This air, however, notwithstanding\r\nits humidity, is so healthy, that the natives are scarce ever visited by\r\nany other disease than the smallpox, and certain cutaneous evils, which\r\nare the effects of dirty living, the great and general reproach of the\r\ncommonalty of this kingdom. Here are a great many living monuments of\r\nlongaevity; and among the rest a person, whom I treat with singular\r\nrespect, as a venerable druid, who has lived near ninety years,\r\nwithout pain or sickness, among oaks of his own planting.--He was once\r\nproprietor of these lands; but being of a projecting spirit, some of\r\nhis schemes miscarried, and he was obliged to part with his possession,\r\nwhich hath shifted hands two or three times since that period; but every\r\nsucceeding proprietor hath done every thing in his power, to make\r\nhis old age easy and comfortable. He has a sufficiency to procure\r\nthe necessaries of life; and he and his old woman reside in a small\r\nconvenient farm-house, having a little garden which he cultivates with\r\nhis own hands. This ancient couple live in great health, peace, and\r\nharmony, and, knowing no wants, enjoy the perfection of content. Mr\r\nSmollet calls him the admiral, because he insists upon steering his\r\npleasure-boat upon the lake; and he spends most of his time in ranging\r\nthrough the woods, which he declares he enjoys as much as if they were\r\nstill his own property--I asked him the other day, if he was never sick,\r\nand he answered, Yes; he had a slight fever the year before the union.\r\nIf he was not deaf, I should take much pleasure in his conversation; for\r\nhe is very intelligent, and his memory is surprisingly retentive--These\r\nare the happy effects of temperance, exercise, and good nature--\r\nNotwithstanding all his innocence, however, he was the cause of great\r\nperturbation to my man Clinker, whose natural superstition has been\r\nmuch injured, by the histories of witches, fairies, ghosts, and goblins,\r\nwhich he has heard in this country--On the evening after our arrival,\r\nHumphry strolled into the wood, in the course of his meditation, and all\r\nat once the admiral stood before him, under the shadow of a spreading\r\noak. Though the fellow is far from being timorous in cases that are not\r\nsupposed preternatural, he could not stand the sight of this apparition,\r\nbut ran into the kitchen, with his hair standing on end, staring wildly,\r\nand deprived of utterance. Mrs Jenkins, seeing him in this condition,\r\nscreamed aloud, ‘Lord have mercy upon us, he has seen something!’ Mrs\r\nTabitha was alarmed, and the whole house in confusion. When he was\r\nrecruited with a dram, I desired him to explain the meaning of all this\r\nagitation; and, with some reluctance, he owned he had seen a spirit,\r\nin the shape of an old man with a white beard, a black cap, and a plaid\r\nnight-gown. He was undeceived by the admiral in person, who, coming in\r\nat this juncture, appeared to be a creature of real flesh and blood.\r\n\r\nDo you know how we fare in this Scottish paradise? We make free with our\r\nlandlord’s mutton, which is excellent, his poultry-yard, his garden,\r\nhis dairy, and his cellar, which are all well stored. We have delicious\r\nsalmon, pike, trout, perch, par, &c. at the door, for the taking. The\r\nFrith of Clyde, on the other side of the hill, supplies us with mullet,\r\nred and grey, cod, mackarel, whiting, and a variety of sea-fish,\r\nincluding the finest fresh herrings I ever tasted. We have sweet, juicy\r\nbeef, and tolerable veal, with delicate bread from the little town of\r\nDunbritton; and plenty of partridge, growse, heath cock, and other game\r\nin presents.\r\n\r\nWe have been visited by all the gentlemen in the neighbourhood, and they\r\nhave entertained us at their houses, not barely with hospitality, but\r\nwith such marks of cordial affection, as one would wish to find among\r\nnear relations, after an absence of many years.\r\n\r\nI told you, in my last, I had projected an excursion to the Highlands,\r\nwhich project I have now happily executed, under the auspices of Sir\r\nGeorge Colquhoun, a colonel in the Dutch service, who offered himself\r\nas our conductor on this occasion. Leaving our women at Cameron, to\r\nthe care and inspection of Lady H-- C--, we set out on horseback for\r\nInverary, the county town of Argyle, and dined on the road with the\r\nLaird of Macfarlane, the greatest genealogist I ever knew in any\r\ncountry, and perfectly acquainted with all the antiquities of Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Argyle has an old castle in Inverary, where he resides when\r\nhe is in Scotland; and hard by is the shell of a noble Gothic palace,\r\nbuilt by the last duke, which, when finished, will be a great ornament\r\nto this part of the Highlands. As for Inverary, it is a place of very\r\nlittle importance.\r\n\r\nThis country is amazingly wild, especially towards the mountains, which\r\nare heaped upon the backs of one another, making a most stupendous\r\nappearance of savage nature, with hardly any signs of cultivation, or\r\neven of population. All is sublimity, silence, and solitude. The people\r\nlive together in glens or bottoms, where they are sheltered from the\r\ncold and storms of winter: but there is a margin of plain ground spread\r\nalong the sea side, which is well inhabited and improved by the arts of\r\nhusbandry; and this I take to be one of the most agreeable tracts of the\r\nwhole island; the sea not only keeps it warm, and supplies it with fish,\r\nbut affords one of the most ravishing prospects in the whole world; I\r\nmean the appearance of the Hebrides, or Western Islands to the number\r\nof three hundred, scattered as far as the eye can reach, in the most\r\nagreeable confusion. As the soil and climate of the Highlands are but\r\nill adapted to the cultivation of corn, the people apply themselves\r\nchiefly to the breeding and feeding of black cattle, which turn to good\r\naccount. Those animals run wild all the winter, without any shelter or\r\nsubsistence, but what they can find among the heath. When the snow lies\r\nso deep and hard, that they cannot penetrate to the roots of the grass,\r\nthey make a diurnal progress, guided by a sure instinct, to the seaside\r\nat low water, where they feed on the alga marina, and other plants that\r\ngrow upon the beach.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this branch of husbandry, which required very little attendance\r\nand labour, is one of the principal causes of that idleness and want of\r\nindustry, which distinguishes these mountaineers in their own country.\r\nWhen they come forth into the world, they become as diligent and alert\r\nas any people upon earth. They are undoubtedly a very distinct species\r\nfrom their fellow subjects of the Lowlands, against whom they indulge\r\nan ancient spirit of animosity; and this difference is very discernible\r\neven among persons of family and education. The Lowlanders are generally\r\ncool and circumspect, the Highlanders fiery and ferocious:’ but this\r\nviolence of their passions serves only to inflame the zeal of their\r\ndevotion to strangers, which is truly enthusiastic.\r\n\r\nWe proceeded about twenty miles beyond Inverary, to the house of a\r\ngentleman, a friend of our conductor, where we stayed a few days, and\r\nwere feasted in such a manner, that I began to dread the consequence to\r\nmy constitution.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the solitude that prevails among these mountains, there\r\nis no want of people in the Highlands. I am credibly informed that the\r\nduke of Argyle can assemble five thousand men in arms, of his own clan\r\nand surname, which is Campbell; and there is besides a tribe of the same\r\nappellation, whose chief’ is the Earl of Breadalbine. The Macdonalds\r\nare as numerous, and remarkably warlike: the Camerons, M’Leods, Frasers,\r\nGrants, M’Kenzies, M’Kays, M’Phersons, M’Intoshes, are powerful clans;\r\nso that if all the Highlanders, including the inhabitants of the Isles,\r\nwere united, they could bring into the field an army of forty thousand\r\nfighting men, capable of undertaking the most dangerous enterprize. We\r\nhave lived to see four thousand of them, without discipline, throw\r\nthe whole kingdom of Great Britain into confusion. They attacked and\r\ndefeated two armies of regular troops accustomed to service. They\r\npenetrated into the centre of England; and afterwards marched back\r\nwith deliberation, in the face of two other armies, through an enemy’s\r\ncountry, where every precaution was taken to cut off their retreat. I\r\nknow not any other people in Europe, who, without the use or knowledge\r\nof arms, will attack regular forces sword in hand, if their chief\r\nwill head them in battle. When disciplined, they cannot fail of being\r\nexcellent soldiers. They do not walk like the generality of mankind, but\r\ntrot and bounce like deer, as if they moved upon springs. They greatly\r\nexcel the Lowlanders in all the exercises that require agility; they are\r\nincredibly abstemious, and patient of hunger and fatigue,--so steeled\r\nagainst the weather, that in travelling, even when the ground is covered\r\nwith snow, they never look for a house, or any other shelter but their\r\nplaid, in which they wrap themselves up, and go to sleep under the cope\r\nof heaven. Such people, in quality of soldiers, must be invincible,\r\nwhen the business is to perform quick marches in a difficult country,\r\nto strike sudden strokes, beat up the enemy’s quarters, harrass their\r\ncavalry, and perform expeditions without the formality of magazines,\r\nbaggage, forage, and artillery. The chieftainship of the Highlanders\r\nis a very dangerous influence operating at the extremity of the island,\r\nwhere the eyes and hands of government cannot be supposed to see [and]\r\nact with precision and vigour. In order to break the force of clanship,\r\nadministration has always practised the political maxim, Divide et\r\nimpera. The legislature hath not only disarmed these mountaineers, but\r\nalso deprived them of their antient garb, which contributed in a great\r\nmeasure to keep up their military spirit; and their slavish tenures are\r\nall dissolved by act of parliament; so that they are at present as\r\nfree and independent of their chiefs, as the law can make them: but the\r\noriginal attachment still remains, and is founded on something prior to\r\nthe feudal system, about which the writers of this age have made such a\r\npother, as if it was a new discovery, like the Copernican system. Every\r\npeculiarity of policy, custom, and even temperament, is affectedly\r\ntraced to this origin, as if the feudal constitution had not been common\r\nto almost all the natives of Europe. For my part, I expect to see the\r\nuse of trunk-hose and buttered ale ascribed to the influence of the\r\nfeudal system. The connection between the clans and their chiefs is,\r\nwithout all doubt, patriarchal. It is founded on hereditary regard\r\nand affection, cherished through a long succession of ages. The clan\r\nconsider the chief as their father, they bear his name, they believe\r\nthemselves descended from his family, and they obey him as their lord,\r\nwith all the ardour of filial love and veneration; while he, on his\r\npart, exerts a paternal authority, commanding, chastising, rewarding,\r\nprotecting, and maintaining them as his own children. If the legislature\r\nwould entirely destroy this connection, it must compel the Highlanders\r\nto change their habitation and their names. Even this experiment has\r\nbeen formerly tried without success--In the reign of James VI a battle\r\nwas fought within a few short miles of this place, between two clans,\r\nthe M’Gregors and the Colquhouns, in which the latter were defeated: the\r\nLaird of M’Gregor made such a barbarous use of his victory, that he was\r\nforfeited and outlawed by act of parliament: his lands were given to the\r\nfamily of Montrose, and his clan were obliged to change their name.\r\nThey obeyed so far, as to call themselves severally Campbell, Graham, or\r\nDrummond, the surnames of the families of Argyle, Montrose, and Perth,\r\nthat they might enjoy the protection of those houses; but they still\r\nadded M’Gregor to their new appellation; and as their chief was deprived\r\nof his estate, they robbed and plundered for his subsistence.--Mr\r\nCameron of Lochiel, the chief of that clan, whose father was attainted\r\nfor having been concerned in the last rebellion, returning from France\r\nin obedience to a proclamation and act of parliament, passed at the\r\nbeginning of the late war, payed a visit to his own country, and hired a\r\nfarm in the neighbourhood of his father’s house, which had been burnt\r\nto the ground. The clan, though ruined and scattered, no sooner heard of\r\nhis arrival than they flocked to him from all quarters, to welcome his\r\nreturn, and in a few days stocked his farm with seven hundred black\r\ncattle, which they had saved in the general wreck of their affairs: but\r\ntheir beloved chief, who was a promising youth, did not live to enjoy\r\nthe fruits of their fidelity and attachment.\r\n\r\nThe most effectual method I know to weaken, and at length destroy this\r\ninfluence, is to employ the commonalty in such a manner as to give them\r\na taste of property and independence. In vain the government grants them\r\nadvantageous leases on the forfeited estates, if they have no property\r\nto prosecute the means of improvement--The sea is an inexhaustible fund\r\nof riches; but the fishery cannot be carried on without vessels, casks,\r\nsalt, lines, nets, and other tackle. I conversed with a sensible man of\r\nthis country, who, from a real spirit of patriotism had set up a fishery\r\non the coast, and a manufacture of coarse linen, for the employment of\r\nthe poor Highlanders. Cod is here in such plenty, that he told me he\r\nhad seen several hundred taken on one line, at one hawl--It must be\r\nobserved, however, that the line was of immense length, and had two\r\nthousand hooks, baited with muscles; but the fish was so superior to\r\nthe cod caught on the banks of Newfoundland, that his correspondent at\r\nLisbon sold them immediately at his own price, although Lent was just\r\nover when they arrived, and the people might be supposed quite cloyed\r\nwith this kind of diet--His linen manufacture was likewise in a\r\nprosperous way, when the late war intervening, all his best hands were\r\npressed into the service.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be expected, that the gentlemen of this country should execute\r\ncommercial schemes to render their vassals independent; nor, indeed, are\r\nsuch schemes suited to their way of life and inclination; but a company\r\nof merchants might, with proper management, turn to good account a\r\nfishery established in this part of Scotland--Our people have a strange\r\nitch to colonize America, when the uncultivated parts of our own island\r\nmight be settled to greater advantage.\r\n\r\nAfter having rambled through the mountains and glens of Argyle, we\r\nvisited the adjacent islands of Ila, Jura, Mull, and Icomkill. In the\r\nfirst, we saw the remains of a castle, built in a lake, where Macdonald,\r\nlord or king of the isles, formerly resided. Jura is famous for having\r\ngiven birth to one Mackcrain, who lived one hundred and eighty years\r\nin one house, and died in the reign of Charles the Second. Mull affords\r\nseveral bays, where there is safe anchorage: in one of which, the\r\nFlorida, a ship of the Spanish armada, was blown up by one of Mr\r\nSmollett’s ancestors--About forty years ago, John duke of Argyle is\r\nsaid to have consulted the Spanish registers, by which it appeared,\r\nthat this ship had the military chest on board--He employed experienced\r\ndivers to examine the wreck; and they found the hull of the vessel still\r\nentire, but so covered with sand, that they could not make their way\r\nbetween decks; however, they picked up several pieces of plate, that\r\nwere scattered about in the bay, and a couple of fine brass cannon.\r\n\r\nIcolmkill, or Iona, is a small island which St Columba chose for his\r\nhabitation--It was respected for its sanctity, and college or seminary\r\nof ecclesiastics--Part of its church is still standing, with the\r\ntombs of several Scottish, Irish, and Danish sovereigns, who were\r\nhere interred--These islanders are very bold and dexterous watermen,\r\nconsequently the better adapted to the fishery: in their manners they\r\nare less savage and impetuous than their countrymen on the continent;\r\nand they speak the Erse or Gaelick in its greatest purity.\r\n\r\nHaving sent round our horses by land, we embarked in the district of\r\nCowal, for Greenock, which is a neat little town, on the other side of\r\nthe Frith, with a curious harbour formed by three stone jetties, carried\r\nout a good way into the sea--Newport-Glasgow is such another place,\r\nabout two miles higher up. Both have a face of business and plenty, and\r\nare supported entirely by the shipping of Glasgow, of which I counted\r\nsixty large vessels in these harbours--Taking boat again at Newport,\r\nwe were in less than an hour landed on the other side, within two short\r\nmiles of our head-quarters, where we found our women in good health and\r\nspirits. They had been two days before joined by Mr. Smollett and his\r\nlady, to whom we have such obligations as I cannot mention, even to you,\r\nwithout blushing.\r\n\r\nTo-morrow we shall bid adieu to the Scotch Arcadia, and begin our\r\nprogress to the southward, taking our way by Lanerk and Nithsdale,\r\nto the west borders of England. I have received so much advantage and\r\nsatisfaction from this tour, that if my health suffers no revolution in\r\nthe winter, I believe I shall be tempted to undertake another\r\nexpedition to the Northern extremity of Caithness, unencumbered by those\r\nimpediments which now clog the heels of,\r\n\r\nYours, MATT. BRAMBLE CAMERON, Sept. 6.\r\n\nTo Miss LAETITIA WILLIS, at Gloucester.\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST LETTY,\r\n\r\nNever did poor prisoner long for deliverance, more than I have longed\r\nfor an opportunity to disburthen my cares into your friendly bosom;\r\nand the occasion which now presents itself, is little less than\r\nmiraculous--Honest Saunders Macawly, the travelling Scotchman, who goes\r\nevery year to Wales, is now at Glasgow, buying goods, and coming to pay\r\nhis respects to our family, has undertaken to deliver this letter\r\ninto your own hand--We have been six weeks in Scotland, and seen the\r\nprincipal towns of the kingdom, where we have been treated with\r\ngreat civility--The people are very courteous; and the country being\r\nexceedingly romantic, suits my turn and inclinations--I contracted some\r\nfriendships at Edinburgh, which is a large and lofty city, full of gay\r\ncompany; and, in particular, commenced an intimate correspondence with\r\none miss R--t--n, an amiable young lady of my own age, whose charms\r\nseemed to soften, and even to subdue the stubborn heart of my brother\r\nJery; but he no sooner left the place than he relapsed into his former\r\ninsensibility--I feel, however, that this indifference is not the family\r\nconstitution--I never admitted but one idea of love, and that has taken\r\nsuch root in my heart, as to be equally proof against all the pulls of\r\ndiscretion, and the frosts of neglect.\r\n\r\nDear Letty! I had an alarming adventure at the hunters ball in\r\nEdinburgh--While I sat discoursing with a friend in a corner, all at\r\nonce the very image of Wilson stood before me, dressed exactly as he was\r\nin the character of Aimwell! It was one Mr Gordon, whom I had not seen\r\nbefore--Shocked at the sudden apparition, I fainted away, and threw the\r\nwhole assembly in confusion--However, the cause of my disorder remained\r\na secret to every body but my brother, who was likewise struck with\r\nthe resemblance, and scolded after we came home--I am very sensible\r\nof Jery’s affection, and know he spoke as well with a view to my own\r\ninterest and happiness, as in regard to the honour of the family; but\r\nI cannot bear to have my wounds probed severely--I was not so much\r\naffected by the censure he passed upon my own indiscretion, as with the\r\nreflection he made on the conduct of Wilson. He observed, that if he\r\nwas really the gentleman he pretended to be, and harboured nothing but\r\nhonourable designs, he would have vindicated his pretensions in the face\r\nof day--This remark made a deep impression upon my mind--I endeavoured\r\nto conceal my thoughts; and this endeavour had a bad effect upon my\r\nhealth and spirits; so it was thought necessary that I should go to the\r\nHighlands, and drink the goat-milk-whey.\r\n\r\nWe went accordingly to Lough Lomond, one of the most enchanting spots\r\nin the whole world; and what with this remedy, which I had every morning\r\nfresh from the mountains, and the pure air, and chearful company, I\r\nhave recovered my flesh and appetite; though there is something still\r\nat bottom, which it is not in the power of air, exercise, company, or\r\nmedicine to remove--These incidents would not touch me so nearly, if I\r\nhad a sensible confidant to sympathize with my affliction, and comfort\r\nme with wholesome advice--I have nothing of this kind, except Win\r\nJenkins, who is really a good body in the main, but very ill qualified\r\nfor such an office--The poor creature is weak in her nerves, as well\r\nas in her understanding; otherwise I might have known the true name and\r\ncharacter of that unfortunate youth--But why do I call him unfortunate?\r\nperhaps the epithet is more applicable to me for having listened to the\r\nfalse professions of--But, hold! I have as yet no right, and sure I have\r\nno inclination to believe any thing to the prejudice of his honour--In\r\nthat reflection I shall still exert my patience. As for Mrs Jenkins, she\r\nherself is really an object of compassion--Between vanity, methodism,\r\nand love, her head is almost turned. I should have more regard for her,\r\nhowever, if she had been more constant in the object of her affection;\r\nbut, truly, she aimed at conquest, and flirted at the same time with my\r\nuncle’s footman, Humphrey Clinker, who is really a deserving young man,\r\nand one Dutton, my brother’s valet de chambre, a debauched fellow; who,\r\nleaving Win in the lurch, ran away with another man’s bride at Berwick.\r\n\r\nMy dear Willis, I am truly ashamed of my own sex--We complain of\r\nadvantages which the men take of our youth, inexperience, insensibility,\r\nand all that; but I have seen enough to believe, that our sex in general\r\nmake it their business to ensnare the other; and for this purpose,\r\nemploy arts which are by no means to be justified--In point of\r\nconstancy, they certainly have nothing to reproach the male part of\r\nthe creation--My poor aunt, without any regard to her years and\r\nimperfections, has gone to market with her charms in every place where\r\nshe thought she had the least chance to dispose of her person, which,\r\nhowever, hangs still heavy on her hands--I am afraid she has used even\r\nreligion as a decoy, though it has not answered her expectation--She has\r\nbeen praying, preaching, and catechising among the methodists, with\r\nwhom this country abounds; and pretends to have such manifestations and\r\nrevelations, as even Clinker himself can hardly believe, though the poor\r\nfellow is half crazy with enthusiasm. As for Jenkins, she affects\r\nto take all her mistress’s reveries for gospel. She has also her\r\nheart-heavings and motions of the spirit; and God forgive me if I think\r\nuncharitably, but all this seems to me to be downright hypocrisy and\r\ndeceit--Perhaps, indeed, the poor girl imposes on herself--She is\r\ngenerally in a flutter, and is much subject to vapours--Since we came\r\nto Scotland, she has seen apparitions, and pretends to prophesy--If I\r\ncould put faith in all these supernatural visitations, I should think\r\nmyself abandoned of grace; for I have neither seen, heard, nor felt\r\nanything of this nature, although I endeavour to discharge the duties\r\nof religion with all the sincerity, zeal, and devotion, that is in the\r\npower of,\r\n\r\nDear Letty, your ever affectionate, LYDIA MELFORD GLASGOW, Sept. 7.\r\n\r\nWe are so far on our return to Brambleton-hall; and I would fain hope\r\nwe shall take Gloucester in our way, in which case I shall have the\r\ninexpressible pleasure of embracing my dear Willis--Pray remember me to\r\nmy worthy governess.\r\n\nTo Mrs MARY JONES, at Brambleton-hall.\r\n\r\nDEAR MARY,\r\n\r\nSunders Macully, the Scotchman, who pushes directly for Vails, has\r\npromised to give it you into your own hand, and therefore I would not\r\nmiss the opportunity to let you know as I am still in the land of the\r\nliving: and yet I have been on the brink of the other world since I sent\r\nyou my last letter.--We went by sea to another kingdom called Fife, and\r\ncoming back, had like to have gone to pot in a storm.--What between the\r\nfrite and sickness, I thought I should have brought my heart up; even\r\nMr Clinker was not his own man for eight and forty hours after we\r\ngot ashore. It was well for some folks that we scaped drownding; for\r\nmistress was very frexious, and seemed but indifferently prepared for\r\na change; but, thank God, she was soon put in a better frame by the\r\nprivate exaltations of the reverend Mr Macrocodile.--We afterwards\r\nchurned to Starling and Grascow, which are a kiple of handsome towns;\r\nand then we went to a gentleman’s house at Loff-Loming, which is a\r\nwonderful sea of fresh water, with a power of hylands in the midst\r\non’t.--They say as how it has n’er a bottom, and was made by a musician\r\nand, truly, I believe it; for it is not in the coarse of nature.--It has\r\ngot waves without wind, fish without fins, and a floating hyland; and\r\none of them is a crutch-yard, where the dead are buried; and always\r\nbefore the person dies, a bell rings of itself to give warning.\r\n\r\nO Mary! this is the land of congyration--The bell knolled when we\r\nwere there--I saw lights, and heard lamentations.--The gentleman, our\r\nlandlord, has got another house, which he was fain to quit, on account\r\nof a mischievous ghost, that would not suffer people to lie in their\r\nbeds. The fairies dwell in a hole of Kairmann, a mounting hard by; and\r\nthey steal away the good women that are in the straw, if so be as how\r\nthere a’n’t a horshoe nailed to the door: and I was shewn an ould vitch,\r\ncalled Elspath Ringavey, with a red petticoat, bleared eyes, and a mould\r\nof grey bristles on her sin.--That she mought do me no harm, I crossed\r\nher hand with a taster, and bid her tell my fortune; and she told me\r\nsuch things descriving Mr Clinker to a hair--but it shall ne’er be said,\r\nthat I minchioned a word of the matter.--As I was troubled with fits,\r\nshe advised me to bathe in the loff, which was holy water; and so I\r\nwent in the morning to a private place along with the house-maid, and\r\nwe bathed in our birth-day soot, after the fashion of the country; and\r\nbehold whilst we dabbled in the loff, sir George Coon started up with a\r\ngun; but we clapt our hands to our faces, and passed by him to the place\r\nwhere we had left our smocks--A civil gentleman would have turned his\r\nhead another way.--My comfit is, he knew not which was which; and, as\r\nthe saying is, all cats in the dark are grey--Whilst we stayed at\r\nLoff-Loming, he and our two squires went three or four days churning\r\namong the wild men of the mountings; a parcel of selvidges that lie in\r\ncaves among the rocks, devour young children, speak Velch, but the vords\r\nare different. Our ladies would not part with Mr Clinker, because he is\r\nso stout and so pyehouse, that he fears neither man nor devils, if so be\r\nas they don’t take him by surprise.--Indeed, he was once so flurried by\r\nan operition, that he had like to have sounded.--He made believe as if\r\nit had been the ould edmiral; but the old edmiral could not have made\r\nhis air to stand on end, and his teeth to shatter; but he said so in\r\nprudence, that the ladies mought not be afear’d. Miss Liddy has been\r\npuny, and like to go into a decline--I doubt her pore art is too\r\ntinder--but the got’s-fey has set her on her legs again.--You nows\r\ngot’s-fey is mother’s milk to a Velch woman. As for mistress, blessed be\r\nGod, she ails nothing.--Her stomick is good, and she improves in grease\r\nand godliness; but, for all that, she may have infections like other\r\npeople, and I believe, she wouldn’t be sorry to be called your ladyship,\r\nwhenever sir George thinks proper to ax the question--But, for my part,\r\nwhatever I may see or hear, not a praticle shall ever pass the lips of,\r\n\r\nDear Molly, Your loving friend, WIN. JENKINS GRASCO, Sept. 7.\r\n\r\nRemember me, as usual, to Sall.--We are now coming home, though not the\r\nnearest road.--I do suppose, I shall find the kitten a fine boar at my\r\nreturn.\r\n\nTo Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bart. at Oxon.\r\n\r\nDEAR KNIGHT,\r\n\r\nOnce more I tread upon English ground, which I like not the worse for\r\nthe six weeks’ ramble I have made among the woods and mountains of\r\nCaledonia; no offence to the land of cakes, where bannocks grow upon\r\nstraw. I never saw my uncle in such health and spirits as he now enjoys.\r\nLiddy is perfectly recovered; and Mrs Tabitha has no reason to complain.\r\nNevertheless, I believe, she was, till yesterday, inclined to give the\r\nwhole Scotch nation to the devil, as a pack of insensible brutes, upon\r\nwhom her accomplishments had been displayed in vain.--At every place\r\nwhere we halted, did she mount the stage, and flourished her rusty arms,\r\nwithout being able to make one conquest. One of her last essays was\r\nagainst the heart of Sir George Colquhoun, with whom she fought all\r\nthe weapons more than twice over.--She was grave and gay by turns--she\r\nmoralized and methodized--she laughed, and romped, and danced, and sung,\r\nand sighed, and ogled, and lisped, and fluttered, and flattered--but all\r\nwas preaching to the desart. The baronet, being a well-bred man, carried\r\nhis civilities as far as she could in conscience expect, and, if evil\r\ntongues are to be believed, some degrees farther; but he was too much a\r\nveteran in gallantry, as well as in war, to fall into any ambuscade that\r\nshe could lay for his affection--While we were absent in the Highlands,\r\nshe practised also upon the laird of Ladrishmore, and even gave him\r\nthe rendezvous in the wood of Drumscailloch; but the laird had such\r\na reverend care of his own reputation, that he came attended with the\r\nparson of the parish, and nothing passed but spiritual communication.\r\nAfter all these miscarriages, our aunt suddenly recollected lieutenant\r\nLismahago, whom, ever since our first arrival at Edinburgh, she seemed\r\nto have utterly forgot; but now she expressed her hopes of seeing him at\r\nDumfries, according to his promise.\r\n\r\nWe set out from Glasgow by the way of Lanerk, the county-town of\r\nClydesdale, in the neighbourhood of which, the whole river Clyde,\r\nrushing down a steep rock, forms a very noble and stupendous cascade.\r\nNext day we were obliged to halt in a small borough, until the carriage,\r\nwhich had received some damage, should be repaired; and here we met\r\nwith an incident which warmly interested the benevolent spirit of Mr\r\nBramble--As we stood at the window of an inn that fronted the public\r\nprison, a person arrived on horseback, genteelly, tho’ plainly, dressed\r\nin a blue frock, with his own hair cut short, and a gold-laced hat upon\r\nhis head.--Alighting, and giving his horse to the landlord, he advanced\r\nto an old man who was at work in paving the street, and accosted him in\r\nthese words: ‘This is hard work for such an old man as you.’--So\r\nsaying, he took the instrument out of his hand, and began to thump the\r\npavement.--After a few strokes, ‘Have you never a son (said he) to ease\r\nyou of this labour?’ ‘Yes, an please Your honour (replied the senior),\r\nI have three hopeful lads, but, at present, they are out of the way.’\r\n‘Honour not me (cried the stranger); but more becomes me to honour your\r\ngrey hairs. Where are those sons you talk of?’ The ancient paviour said,\r\nhis eldest son was a captain in the East Indies; and the youngest had\r\nlately inlisted as a soldier, in hopes of prospering like his brother.\r\nThe gentleman desiring to know what was become of the second, he wiped\r\nhis eyes, and owned, he had taken upon him his old father’s debts, for\r\nwhich he was now in the prison hard by.\r\n\r\nThe traveller made three quick steps towards the jail, then turning\r\nshort, ‘Tell me (said he), has that unnatural captain sent you nothing\r\nto relieve your distress?’ ‘Call him not unnatural (replied the other);\r\nGod’s blessing be upon him! he sent me a great deal of money; but I made\r\na bad use of it; I lost it by being security for a gentleman that was\r\nmy landlord, and was stript of all I had in the world besides.’ At that\r\ninstant a young man, thrusting out his head and neck between two iron\r\nbars in the prison-window, exclaimed, ‘Father! father! if my brother\r\nWilliam is in life, that’s he!’ ‘I am!--I am!--(cried the stranger,\r\nclasping the old man in his arms, and shedding a flood of tears)--I\r\nam your son Willy, sure enough!’ Before the father, who was quite\r\nconfounded, could make any return to this tenderness, a decent old woman\r\nbolting out from the door of a poor habitation, cried, ‘Where is my\r\nbairn? where is my dear Willy?’--The captain no sooner beheld her, than\r\nhe quitted his father, and ran into her embrace.\r\n\r\nI can assure you, my uncle, who saw and heard every thing that passed,\r\nwas as much moved as any one of the parties concerned in this pathetic\r\nrecognition--He sobbed, and wept, and clapped his hands, and hollowed,\r\nand finally ran down into the street. By this time, the captain had\r\nretired with his parents, and all the inhabitants of the place were\r\nassembled at the door.--Mr Bramble, nevertheless, pressed thro’ the\r\ncrowd, and entering the house, ‘Captain (said he), I beg the favour of\r\nyour acquaintance. I would have travelled a hundred miles to see this\r\naffecting scene; and I shall think myself happy if you and your parents\r\nwill dine with me at the public house.’ The captain thanked him for his\r\nkind invitation, which, he said, he would accept with pleasure; but in\r\nthe mean time, he could not think of eating or drinking, while his poor\r\nbrother was in trouble. He forthwith deposited a sum equal to the debt\r\nin the hands of the magistrate, who ventured to set his brother at\r\nliberty without farther process; and then the whole family repaired to\r\nthe inn with my uncle, attended by the crowd, the individuals of which\r\nshook their townsman by the hand, while he returned their caresses\r\nwithout the least sign of pride or affectation.\r\n\r\nThis honest favourite of fortune, whose name was Brown, told my uncle,\r\nthat he had been bred a weaver, and, about eighteen years ago, had,\r\nfrom a spirit of idleness and dissipation, enlisted as a soldier in the\r\nservice of the East-India company; that, in the course of duty, he had\r\nthe good fortune to attract the notice and approbation of Lord Clive,\r\nwho preferred him from one step to another, till he attained the rank\r\nof captain and pay-master to the regiment, in which capacities he\r\nhad honestly amassed above twelve thousand pounds, and, at the peace,\r\nresigned his commission.--He had sent several remittances to his father,\r\nwho received the first only, consisting of one hundred pounds; the\r\nsecond had fallen into the hands of a bankrupt; and the third had been\r\nconsigned to a gentleman of Scotland, who died before it arrived; so\r\nthat it still remained to be accounted for by his executors. He now\r\npresented the old man with fifty pounds for his present occasions, over\r\nand above bank notes for one hundred, which he had deposited for his\r\nbrother’s release.--He brought along with him a deed ready executed, by\r\nwhich he settled a perpetuity of four-score pounds upon his parents, to\r\nbe inherited by their other two sons after their decease.--He promised\r\nto purchase a commission for his youngest brother; to take the other as\r\nhis own partner in a manufacture which he intended to set up, to give\r\nemployment and bread to the industrious; and to give five hundred\r\npounds, by way of dower, to his sister, who had married a farmer in low\r\ncircumstances. Finally, he gave fifty pounds to the poor of the town\r\nwhere he was born, and feasted all the inhabitants without exception.\r\n\r\nMy uncle was so charmed with the character of captain Brown, that he\r\ndrank his health three times successively at dinner--He said, he was\r\nproud of his acquaintance; that he was an honour to his country, and\r\nhad in some measure redeemed human nature from the reproach of pride,\r\nselfishness, and ingratitude.--For my part, I was as much pleased\r\nwith the modesty as with the filial virtue of this honest soldier,\r\nwho assumed no merit from his success, and said very little of his own\r\ntransactions, though the answers he made to our inquiries were equally\r\nsensible and laconic, Mrs Tabitha behaved very graciously to him until\r\nshe understood that he was going to make a tender of his hand to a\r\nperson of low estate, who had been his sweet-heart while he worked as\r\na journeyman weaver.--Our aunt was no sooner made acquainted with this\r\ndesign, than she starched up her behaviour with a double proportion of\r\nreserve; and when the company broke up, she observed with a toss of her\r\nnose, that Brown was a civil fellow enough, considering the lowness of\r\nhis original; but that Fortune, though she had mended his circumstances,\r\nwas incapable to raise his ideas, which were still humble and plebeian.\r\n\r\nOn the day that succeeded this adventure, we went some miles out of our\r\nroad to see Drumlanrig, a seat belonging to the duke of Queensberry,\r\nwhich appears like a magnificent palace erected by magic, in the midst\r\nof a wilderness.--It is indeed a princely mansion, with suitable parks\r\nand plantations, rendered still more striking by the nakedness of\r\nthe surrounding country, which is one of the wildest tracts in all\r\nScotland.--This wildness, however, is different from that of the\r\nHighlands; for here the mountains, instead of heath, are covered with a\r\nfine green swarth, affording pasture to innumerable flocks of sheep. But\r\nthe fleeces of this country, called Nithsdale, are not comparable to the\r\nwool of Galloway, which is said to equal that of Salisbury plain. Having\r\npassed the night at the castle of Drumlanrig, by invitation from\r\nthe duke himself, who is one of the best men that ever breathed, we\r\nprosecuted our journey to Dumfries, a very elegant trading town near\r\nthe borders of England, where we found plenty of good provision and\r\nexcellent wine, at very reasonable prices, and the accommodation as good\r\nin all respects as in any part of South-Britain. If I was confined to\r\nScotland for life, I would chuse Dumfries as the place of my residence.\r\nHere we made enquiries about captain Lismahago, of whom hearing no\r\ntidings, we proceeded by the Solway Frith, to Carlisle. You must know,\r\nthat the Solway sands, upon which travellers pass at low water, are\r\nexceedingly dangerous, because, as the tide makes, they become quick\r\nin different places, and the flood rushes in so impetuously, that the\r\npassengers are often overtaken by the sea and perish.\r\n\r\nIn crossing these treacherous Syrtes with a guide, we perceived a\r\ndrowned horse, which Humphry Clinker, after due inspection, declared to\r\nbe the very identical beast which Mr Lismahago rode when he parted with\r\nus at Feltonbridge in Northumberland. This information, which seemed\r\nto intimate that our friend the lieutenant had shared the fate of his\r\nhorse, affected us all, and above all our aunt Tabitha, who shed salt\r\ntears, and obliged Clinker to pull a few hairs out of the dead horse’s\r\ntail, to be worn in a ring as a remembrance of his master: but her grief\r\nand ours was not of long duration; for one of the first persons we saw\r\nin Carlisle, was the lieutenant in propria persona, bargaining with\r\na horse-dealer for another steed, in the yard of the inn where we\r\nalighted.--Mrs Bramble was the first that perceived him, and screamed\r\nas if she had seen a ghost; and, truly, at a proper time and place, he\r\nmight very well have passed for an inhabitant of another world; for\r\nhe was more meagre and grim than before.--We received him the more\r\ncordially for having supposed he had been drowned; and he was not\r\ndeficient in expressions of satisfaction at this meeting. He told us,\r\nhe had enquired for us at Dumfries, and been informed by a travelling\r\nmerchant from Glasgow, that we had resolved to return by the way of\r\nColdstream. He said, that in passing the sands without a guide, his\r\nhorse had knocked up, and he himself must have perished, if he had not\r\nbeen providentially relieved by a return post-chaise.--He moreover gave\r\nus to understand, that his scheme of settling in his own country having\r\nmiscarried, he was so far on his way to London, with a view to embark\r\nfor North-America, where he intended to pass the rest of his days among\r\nhis old friends the Miamis, and amuse himself in finishing the education\r\nof the son he had by his beloved Squinkinacoosta.\r\n\r\nThis project was by no means agreeable to our good aunt, who expatiated\r\nupon the fatigues and dangers that would attend such a long voyage\r\nby sea, and afterwards such a tedious journey by land--She enlarged\r\nparticularly on the risque he would run, with respect to the concerns\r\nof his precious soul, among savages who had not yet received the glad\r\ntidings of salvation; and she hinted that his abandoning Great-Britain\r\nmight, perhaps, prove fatal to the inclinations of some deserving\r\nperson, whom he was qualified to make happy for life. My uncle, who is\r\nreally a Don Quixote in generosity, understanding that Lismahago’s real\r\nreason for leaving Scotland was the impossibility of subsisting in it\r\nwith any decency upon the wretched provision of a subaltern’s half-pay,\r\nbegan to be warmly interested on the side of compassion.--He thought\r\nit very hard, that a gentleman who had served his country with honour,\r\nshould be driven by necessity to spend his old age, among the refuse of\r\nmankind, in such a remote part of the world.--He discoursed with me upon\r\nthe subject; observing, that he would willingly offer the lieutenant an\r\nasylum at Brambleton-hall, if he did not foresee that his singularities\r\nand humour of contradiction would render him an intolerable housemate,\r\nthough his conversation at some times might be both instructive and\r\nentertaining: but, as there seemed to be something particular in\r\nhis attention to Mrs Tabitha, he and I agreed in opinion, that this\r\nintercourse should be encouraged and improved, if possible, into a\r\nmatrimonial union; in which case there would be a comfortable provision\r\nfor both; and they might be settled in a house of their own, so that Mr\r\nBramble should have no more of their company than he desired.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this design, Lismahago has been invited to pass the\r\nwinter at Brambleton-hall, as it will be time enough to execute his\r\nAmerican project in the spring.--He has taken time to consider of this\r\nproposal; mean while, he will keep us company as far as we travel in the\r\nroad to Bristol, where he has hopes of getting a passage for America.\r\nI make no doubt but that he will postpone his voyage, and prosecute his\r\naddresses to a happy consummation; and sure, if it produces any\r\nfruit, it must be of a very peculiar flavour. As the weather continues\r\nfavourable, I believe, we shall take the Peak of Derbyshire and Buxton\r\nWells in our way.--At any rate, from the first place where we make any\r\nstay, you shall hear again from\r\n\r\nYours always, J. MELFORD CARLISLE, Sep. 12.\r\n\nTo Dr LEWIS.\r\n\r\nDEAR DOCTOR,\r\n\r\nThe peasantry of Scotland are certainly on a poor footing all over the\r\nkingdom; and yet they look better, and are better cloathed than those\r\nof the same rank in Burgundy, and many other places of France and Italy;\r\nnay, I will venture to say they are better fed, notwithstanding\r\nthe boasted wine of these foreign countries. The country people of\r\nNorth-Britain live chiefly on oat-meal, and milk, cheese, butter,\r\nand some garden-stuff, with now and then a pickled-herring, by way of\r\ndelicacy; but flesh-meat they seldom or never taste; nor any kind of\r\nstrong liquor, except two-penny, at times of uncommon festivity--Their\r\nbreakfast is a kind of hasty pudding, of oat-meal or pease-meal, eaten\r\nwith milk. They have commonly pottage for dinner, composed of cale or\r\ncole, leeks, barley or big, and butter; and this is reinforced with\r\nbread and cheese, made of skimmed-milk--At night they sup on sowens or\r\nflummery of oat-meal--In a scarcity of oats, they use the meal of barley\r\nand pease, which is both nourishing and palatable. Some of them have\r\npotatoes; and you find parsnips in every peasant’s garden--They are\r\ncloathed with a coarse kind of russet of their own making, which is\r\nboth decent and warm--They dwell in poor huts, built of loose stones and\r\nturf, without any mortar, having a fireplace or hearth in the middle,\r\ngenerally made of an old mill-stone, and a hole at top to let out the\r\nsmoke.\r\n\r\nThese people, however, are content, and wonderfully sagacious--All of\r\nthem read the Bible, and are even qualified to dispute upon the\r\narticles of their faith; which in those parts I have seen, is entirely\r\nPresbyterian. I am told, that the inhabitants of Aberdeenshire are still\r\nmore acute. I once knew a Scotch gentleman at London, who had declared\r\nwar against this part of his countrymen; and swore that the impudence\r\nand knavery of the Scots, in that quarter, had brought a reproach upon\r\nthe whole nation.\r\n\r\nThe river Clyde, above Glasgow, is quite pastoral; and the banks of it\r\nare every where adorned with fine villas. From the sea to its source,\r\nwe may reckon the seats of many families of the first rank, such as the\r\nduke of Argyle at Roseneath, the earl of Bute in the isle of that name,\r\nthe earl of Glencairn at Finlayston, lord Blantyre at Areskine, the\r\ndutchess of Douglas at Bothwell, duke Hamilton at Hamilton, the duke of\r\nDouglas at Douglas, and the earl of Hyndford at Carmichael. Hamilton is\r\na noble palace, magnificently furnished; and hard by is the village of\r\nthat name, one of the neatest little towns I have seen in any country.\r\nThe old castle of Douglas being burned to the ground by accident, the\r\nlate duke resolved, as head of the first family of Scotland, to have the\r\nlargest house in the kingdom, and ordered a plan for this purpose; but\r\nthere was only one wing of it finished when he died. It is to be hoped\r\nthat his nephew, who is now in possession of his great fortune, will\r\ncomplete the design of his predecessor--Clydesdale is in general\r\npopulous and rich, containing a great number of gentlemen, who\r\nare independent in their fortune; but it produces more cattle than\r\ncorn--This is also the case with Tweedale, through part of which\r\nwe passed, and Nithsdale, which is generally rough, wild, and\r\nmountainous--These hills are covered with sheep; and this is the small\r\ndelicious mutton, so much preferable to that of the London-market. As\r\ntheir feeding costs so little, the sheep are not killed till five years\r\nold, when their flesh, juices, and flavour are in perfection; but their\r\nfleeces are much damaged by the tar, with which they are smeared to\r\npreserve them from the rot in winter, during which they run wild night\r\nand day, and thousands are lost under huge wreaths of snow--‘Tis pity\r\nthe farmers cannot contrive some means to shelter this useful animal\r\nfrom the inclemencies of a rigorous climate, especially from the\r\nperpetual rains, which are more prejudicial than the greatest extremity\r\nof cold weather.\r\n\r\nOn the little river Nid, is situated the castle of Drumlanrig, one\r\nof the noblest seats in Great-Britain, belonging to the duke of\r\nQueensberry; one of those few noblemen whose goodness of heart does\r\nhonour to human-nature--I shall not pretend to enter into a description\r\nof this palace, which is really an instance of the sublime in\r\nmagnificence, as well as in situation, and puts one in mind of the\r\nbeautiful city of Palmyra, rising like a vision in the midst of\r\nthe wilderness. His grace keeps open house, and lives with great\r\nsplendour--He did us the honour to receive us with great courtesy, and\r\ndetain’d us all night, together with above twenty other guests, with all\r\ntheir servants and horses to a very considerable number--The dutchess\r\nwas equally gracious, and took our ladies under her immediate\r\nprotection. The longer I live, I see more reason to believe that\r\nprejudices of education are never wholly eradicated, even when they\r\nare discovered to be erroneous and absurd. Such habits of thinking as\r\ninterest the grand passions, cleave to the human heart in such a manner,\r\nthat though an effort of reason may force them from their hold for a\r\nmoment, this violence no sooner ceases, than they resume their grasp\r\nwith an increased elasticity and adhesion.\r\n\r\nI am led into this reflection, by what passed at the duke’s table after\r\nsupper. The conversation turned upon the vulgar notions of spirits and\r\nomens, that prevail among the commonalty of North-Britain, and all the\r\ncompany agreed, that nothing could be more ridiculous. One gentleman,\r\nhowever, told a remarkable story of himself, by way of speculation\r\n‘Being on a party of hunting in the North (said he), I resolved to visit\r\nan old friend, whom I had not seen for twenty years--So long he had been\r\nretired and sequestered from all his acquaintance, and lived in a moping\r\nmelancholy way, much afflicted with lowness of spirits, occasioned by\r\nthe death of his wife, whom he had loved with uncommon affection. As he\r\nresided in a remote part of the country, and we were five gentlemen with\r\nas many servants, we carried some provision with us from the next market\r\ntown, lest we should find him unprepared for our reception. The roads\r\nbeing bad, we did not arrive at the house till two o’clock in the\r\nafternoon; and were agreeably surprised to find a very good dinner ready\r\nin the kitchen, and the cloth laid with six covers. My friend himself\r\nappeared in his best apparel at the gate, and received us with open\r\narms, telling me he had been expecting us these two hours. Astonished at\r\nthis declaration, I asked who had given him intelligence of our coming?\r\nand he smiled without making any other reply. However, presuming upon\r\nour former intimacy, I afterwards insisted upon knowing; and he told me,\r\nvery gravely, he had seen me in a vision of the second sight--Nay, he\r\ncalled in the evidence of his steward, who solemnly declared, that his\r\nmaster had the day before apprised him of my coming, with four other\r\nstrangers, and ordered him to provide accordingly; in consequence of\r\nwhich intimation, he had prepared the dinner which we were now eating;\r\nand laid the covers according to the number foretold.’ The incident\r\nwe all owned to be remarkable, and I endeavoured to account for it by\r\nnatural means. I observed, that as the gentleman was of a visionary\r\nturn, the casual idea, or remembrance of his old friend, might suggest\r\nthose circumstances, which accident had for once realized; but that in\r\nall probability he had seen many visions of the same kind, which were\r\nnever verified. None of the company directly dissented from my opinion;\r\nbut from the objections that were hinted, I could plainly perceive that\r\nthe majority were persuaded there was something more extraordinary in\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\nAnother gentleman of the company, addressing himself to me, ‘Without all\r\ndoubt (said he), a diseased imagination is very apt to produce visions;\r\nbut we must find some other method to account for something of this\r\nkind, that happened within these eight days in my neighbourhood--A\r\ngentleman of a good family, who cannot be deemed a visionary in any\r\nsense of the word, was near his own gate, in the twilight, visited by\r\nhis grandfather, who has been dead these fifteen years--The spectre was\r\nmounted seemingly on the very horse he used to ride, with an angry and\r\nterrible countenance, and said something, which his grandson, in the\r\nconfusion of fear, could not understand. But this was not all--He lifted\r\nup a huge horse whip, and applied it with great violence to his back\r\nand shoulders, on which I saw the impression with my own eyes. The\r\napparition was afterwards seen by the sexton of the parish, hovering\r\nabout the tomb where his body lies interred; as the man declared to\r\nseveral persons in the village, before he knew what had happened to the\r\ngentleman--Nay, he actually came to me as a justice of the peace, in\r\norder to make oath of these particulars, which, however, I declined\r\nadministering. As for the grandson of the defunct, he is a sober,\r\nsensible, worldly minded fellow, too intent upon schemes of interest to\r\ngive in to reveries. He would have willingly concealed the affair; but\r\nhe bawled out in the first transport of his fear, and, running into\r\nthe house, exposed his back and his sconce to the whole family; so that\r\nthere was no denying it in the sequel. It is now the common discourse of\r\nthe country, that this appearance and behaviour of the old man’s spirit,\r\nportends some great calamity to the family, and the good-woman has\r\nactually taken to her bed in this apprehension.’\r\n\r\nThough I did not pretend to explain this mystery, I said, I did not at\r\nall doubt, but it would one day appear to be a deception; and, in all\r\nprobability, a scheme executed by some enemy of the person who had\r\nsustained the assault; but still the gentleman insisted upon the\r\nclearness of the evidence, and the concurrence of testimony, by which\r\ntwo creditable witnesses, without any communication one with another,\r\naffirmed the appearance of the same man, with whose person they were\r\nboth well acquainted--From Drumlanrig we pursued the course of the Nid\r\nto Dumfries, which stands seven miles above the place where the river\r\nfalls into the sea; and is, after Glasgow, the handsomest town I have\r\nseen in Scotland. The inhabitants, indeed, seem to have proposed that\r\ncity as their model; not only in beautifying their town and regulating\r\nits police, but, also in prosecuting their schemes of commerce and\r\nmanufacture, by which they are grown rich and opulent.\r\n\r\nWe re-entered England, by the way of Carlisle, where we accidentally\r\nmet with our friend Lismahago, whom we had in vain inquired after at\r\nDumfries and other places--It would seem that the captain, like the\r\nprophets of old, is but little honoured in his own country, which he\r\nhas now renounced for ever--He gave me the following particulars of his\r\nvisit to his native soil--In his way to the place of his nativity, he\r\nlearned that his nephew had married the daughter of a burgeois, who\r\ndirected a weaving manufacture, and had gone into partnership with his\r\nfather-in-law: chagrined with this information, he had arrived at the\r\ngate in the twilight, where he heard the sound of treddles in the great\r\nhall, which had exasperated him to such a degree, that he had like to\r\nhave lost his senses: while he was thus transported with indignation,\r\nhis nephew chanced to come forth, when, being no longer master of his\r\npassion, he cried, ‘Degenerate rascal! you have made my father’s house a\r\nden of thieves;’ and at the same time chastised him with his\r\nhorse-whip; then, riding round the adjoining village, he had visited\r\nthe burying-ground of his ancestors by moon-light; and, having paid\r\nhis respects to their manes, travelled all night to another part of\r\nthe country--Finding the head of the family in such a disgraceful\r\nsituation, all his own friends dead or removed from the places of their\r\nformer residence, and the expence of living increased to double of what\r\nit had been, when he first left his native country, he had bid it an\r\neternal adieu, and was determined to seek for repose among the forests\r\nof America.\r\n\r\nI was no longer at a loss to account for the apparition, which had\r\nbeen described at Drumlanrig; and when I repeated the story to the\r\nlieutenant, he was much pleased to think his resentment had been so much\r\nmore effectual than he intended; and he owned, he might at such an hour,\r\nand in such an equipage, very well pass for the ghost of his father,\r\nwhom he was said greatly to resemble--Between friends, I fancy Lismahago\r\nwill find a retreat without going so far as the wigwams of the Miamis.\r\nMy sister Tabby is making continual advances to him, in the way of\r\naffection; and, if I may trust to appearances, the captain is disposed\r\nto take opportunity by the forelock. For my part, I intend to encourage\r\nthis correspondence, and shall be glad to see them united--In that case,\r\nwe shall find a way to settle them comfortably in our own neighbourhood.\r\nI, and my servants, will get rid of a very troublesome and tyrannic\r\ngouvernante; and I shall have the benefit of Lismahago’s conversation,\r\nwithout being obliged to take more of his company than I desire; for\r\nthough an olla is a high-flavoured dish, I could not bear to dine upon\r\nit every day of my life.\r\n\r\nI am much pleased with Manchester, which is one of the most agreeable\r\nand flourishing towns in Great-Britain; and I perceive that this is\r\nthe place which hath animated the spirit, and suggested the chief\r\nmanufactures of Glasgow. We propose to visit Chatsworth, the Peak,\r\nand Buxton, from which last place we shall proceed directly homewards,\r\nthough by easy journies. If the season has been as favourable in Wales\r\nas in the North, your harvest is happily finished; and we have nothing\r\nleft to think of but our October, of which let Barns be properly\r\nreminded. You will find me much better in flesh than I was at our\r\nparting; and this short separation has given a new edge to those\r\nsentiments of friendship with which I always have been, and ever shall\r\nbe,\r\n\r\nYours, MATT. BRAMBLE MANCHESTER, Sept. 15.\r\n\nTo Mrs GWILLIM, house-keeper at Brambleton-hall.\r\n\r\nMRS GWYLLIM,\r\n\r\nIt has pleased Providence to bring us safe back to England, and partake\r\nus in many pearls by land and water, in particular the Devil’s Harse\r\na pike, and Hoyden’s Hole, which hath got no bottom; and, as we are\r\ndrawing huomwards, it may be proper to uprise you, that Brambleton-hall\r\nmay be in condition to receive us, after this long gurney to the islands\r\nof Scotland. By the first of next month you may begin to make constant\r\nfires in my brother’s chamber and mine; and burn a fagget every day in\r\nthe yellow damask room: have the tester and curtains dusted, and\r\nthe featherbed and matrosses well haired, because, perhaps, with the\r\nblissing of haven, they may be yoosed on some occasion. Let the ould\r\nhogsheads be well skewred and seasoned for bear, as Mat is resolved to\r\nhave his seller choak fool.\r\n\r\nIf the house was mine, I would turn over a new leaf--I don’t see why\r\nthe sarvants of Wales shouldn’t drink fair water, and eat hot cakes and\r\nbarley cale, as they do in Scotland, without troubling the botcher\r\nabove once a quarter--I hope you keep accunt of Roger’s purseeding in\r\nreverence to the buttermilk. I expect my dew when I come huom, without\r\nbaiting an ass, I’ll assure you.--As you must have layed a great many\r\nmore eggs than would be eaten, I do suppose there is a power of turks,\r\nchickings, and guzzling about the house; and a brave kergo of cheese\r\nready for market; and that the owl has been sent to Crickhowel, saving\r\nwhat the maids spun in the family.\r\n\r\nPray let the whole house and furniture have a thorough cleaning from top\r\nto bottom, for the honour of Wales; and let Roger search into, and make\r\na general clearance of the slit holes, which the maids have in secret;\r\nfor I know they are much given to sloth and uncleanness. I hope you have\r\nworked a reformation among them, as I exhorted you in my last, and set\r\ntheir hearts upon better things than they can find in junkitting and\r\ncaterwauling with the fellows of the country.\r\n\r\nAs for Win Jenkins, she has undergone a perfect metamurphysis, and is\r\nbecome a new creeter from the ammunition of Humphry Clinker, our new\r\nfootman, a pious young man, who has laboured exceedingly, that she may\r\nbring forth fruits of repentance. I make no doubt but he will take the\r\nsame pains with that pert hussey Mary Jones, and all of you; and that\r\nhe may have power given to penetrate and instill his goodness, even into\r\nyour most inward parts, is the fervent prayer of\r\n\r\nYour friend in the spirit, TAB. BRAMBLE Septr. 18.\r\n\nTo Dr LEWIS.\r\n\r\nDEAR LEWIS,\r\n\r\nLismahago is more paradoxical than ever.--The late gulp he had of his\r\nnative air, seems to have blown fresh spirit into all his polemical\r\nfaculties. I congratulated him the other day on the present flourishing\r\nstate of his country, observing that the Scots were now in a fair way\r\nto wipe off the national reproach of poverty, and expressing my\r\nsatisfaction at the happy effects of the union, so conspicuous in\r\nthe improvement of their agriculture, commerce, manufactures, and\r\nmanners--The lieutenant, screwing up his features into a look of dissent\r\nand disgust, commented on my remarks to this effect--‘Those who reproach\r\na nation for its poverty, when it is not owing to the profligacy or vice\r\nof the people, deserve no answer. The Lacedaemonians were poorer than\r\nthe Scots, when they took the lead among all the free states of Greece,\r\nand were esteemed above them all for their valour and their virtue. The\r\nmost respectable heroes of ancient Rome, such as Fabricius, Cincinnatus,\r\nand Regulus, were poorer than the poorest freeholder in Scotland; and\r\nthere are at this day individuals in North-Britain, one of whom can\r\nproduce more gold and silver than the whole republic of Rome could raise\r\nat those times when her public virtue shone with unrivalled lustre; and\r\npoverty was so far from being a reproach, that it added fresh laurels\r\nto her fame, because it indicated a noble contempt of wealth, which was\r\nproof against all the arts of corruption--If poverty be a subject\r\nfor reproach, it follows that wealth is the object of esteem and\r\nveneration--In that case, there are Jews and others in Amsterdam and\r\nLondon, enriched by usury, peculation, and different species of fraud\r\nand extortion, who are more estimable than the most virtuous and\r\nillustrious members of the community. An absurdity which no man in his\r\nsenses will offer to maintain.--Riches are certainly no proof of merit:\r\nnay they are often (if not most commonly) acquired by persons of sordid\r\nminds and mean talents: nor do they give any intrinsic worth to the\r\npossessor; but, on the contrary, tend to pervert his understanding, and\r\nrender his morals more depraved. But, granting that poverty were really\r\nmatter of reproach, it cannot be justly imputed to Scotland. No country\r\nis poor that can supply its inhabitants with the necessaries of life,\r\nand even afford articles for exportation. Scotland is rich in natural\r\nadvantages: it produces every species of provision in abundance, vast\r\nherds of cattle and flocks of sheep, with a great number of horses;\r\nprodigious quantities of wool and flax, with plenty of copse wood, and\r\nin some parts large forests of timber. The earth is still more rich\r\nbelow than above the surface. It yields inexhaustible stores of coal,\r\nfree-stone, marble, lead, iron, copper, and silver, with some gold. The\r\nsea abounds with excellent fish, and salt to cure them for exportation;\r\nand there are creeks and harbours round the whole kingdom, for the\r\nconvenience and security of navigation. The face of the country displays\r\na surprising number of cities, towns, villas, and villages, swarming\r\nwith people; and there seems to be no want of art, industry, government,\r\nand police: such a kingdom can never be called poor, in any sense of the\r\nword, though there may be many others more powerful and opulent. But the\r\nproper use of those advantages, and the present prosperity of the Scots,\r\nyou seem to derive from the union of the two kingdoms!’\r\n\r\nI said, I supposed he would not deny that the appearance of the country\r\nwas much mended; that the people lived better, had more trade, and a\r\ngreater quantity of money circulating since the union, than before.\r\n‘I may safely admit these premises (answered the lieutenant), without\r\nsubscribing to your inference. The difference you mention, I should\r\ntake to be the natural progress of improvement--Since that period, other\r\nnations, such as the Swedes, the Danes, and in particular the French,\r\nhave greatly increased in commerce, without any such cause assigned.\r\nBefore the union, there was a remarkable spirit of trade among the\r\nScots, as appeared in the case of their Darien company, in which they\r\nhad embarked no less than four hundred thousand pounds sterling; and in\r\nthe flourishing state of the maritime towns in Fife, and on the eastern\r\ncoast, enriched by their trade with France, which failed in consequence\r\nof the union. The only solid commercial advantage reaped from that\r\nmeasure, was the privilege of trading to the English plantations; yet,\r\nexcepting Glasgow and Dumfries, I don’t know any other Scotch towns\r\nconcerned in that traffick. In other respects, I conceive the Scots were\r\nlosers by the union.--They lost the independency of their state, the\r\ngreatest prop of national spirit; they lost their parliament, and their\r\ncourts of justice were subjected to the revision and supremacy of an\r\nEnglish tribunal.’\r\n\r\n‘Softly, captain (cried I), you cannot be said to have lost your own\r\nparliament, while you are represented in that of Great-Britain.’ ‘True\r\n(said he, with a sarcastic grin), in debates of national competition,\r\nthe sixteen peers and forty-five commoners of Scotland, must make a\r\nformidable figure in the scale, against the whole English legislature.’\r\n‘Be that as it may (I observed) while I had the honour to sit in the\r\nlower house, the Scotch members had always the majority on their side.’\r\n‘I understand you, Sir (said he), they generally side with the majority;\r\nso much the worse for their constituents. But even this evil is not the\r\nworst they have sustained by the union. Their trade has been saddled\r\nwith grievous impositions, and every article of living severely taxed,\r\nto pay the interest of enormous debts, contracted by the English, in\r\nsupport of measures and connections in which the Scots had no interest\r\nnor concern.’ I begged he would at least allow, that by the union the\r\nScots were admitted to all the privileges and immunities of English\r\nsubjects; by which means multitudes of them were provided for in the\r\narmy and navy, and got fortunes in different parts of England, and its\r\ndominions. ‘All these (said he) become English subjects to all intents\r\nand purposes, and are in a great measure lost to their mother-country.\r\nThe spirit of rambling and adventure has been always peculiar to the\r\nnatives of Scotland. If they had not met with encouragement in England,\r\nthey would have served and settled, as formerly, in other countries,\r\nsuch as Muscovy, Sweden, Denmark, Poland, Germany, France, Piedmont, and\r\nItaly, in all which nations their descendants continue to flourish even\r\nat this day.’\r\n\r\nBy this time my patience began to fail and I exclaimed, ‘For God’s\r\nsake, what has England got by this union which, you say, has been so\r\nproductive of misfortune to the Scots.’ ‘Great and manifold are the\r\nadvantages which England derives from the union (said Lismahago, in\r\na solemn tone). First and foremost, the settlement of the protestant\r\nsuccession, a point which the English ministry drove with such\r\neagerness, that no stone was left unturned, to cajole and bribe a few\r\nleading men, to cram the union down the throats of the Scottish nation,\r\nwho were surprisingly averse to the expedient. They gained by it a\r\nconsiderable addition of territory, extending their dominion to the sea\r\non all sides of the island, thereby shutting up all back-doors against\r\nthe enterprizes of their enemies. They got an accession of above a\r\nmillion of useful subjects, constituting a never-failing nursery of\r\nseamen, soldiers, labourers, and mechanics; a most valuable acquisition\r\nto a trading country, exposed to foreign wars, and obliged to maintain\r\na number of settlements in all the four quarters of the globe. In the\r\ncourse of seven years, during the last war, Scotland furnished the\r\nEnglish army and navy with seventy thousand men, over and above those\r\nwho migrated to their colonies, or mingled with them at home in the\r\ncivil departments of life. This was a very considerable and seasonable\r\nsupply to a nation, whose people had been for many years decreasing in\r\nnumber, and whose lands and manufactures were actually suffering for\r\nwant of hands. I need not remind you of the hackneyed maxim, that, to a\r\nnation in such circumstances, a supply of industrious people is a\r\nsupply of wealth; nor repeat an observation, which is now received as\r\nan eternal truth, even among the English themselves, that the Scots who\r\nsettle in South-Britain are remarkably sober, orderly, and industrious.’\r\n\r\nI allowed the truth of this remark, adding, that by their industry,\r\noeconomy, and circumspection, many of them in England, as well as in her\r\ncolonies, amassed large fortunes, with which they returned to their own\r\ncountry, and this was so much lost to South-Britain.--‘Give me leave,\r\nsir (said he), to assure you, that in your fact you are mistaken, and\r\nin your deduction erroneous. Not one in two hundred that leave Scotland\r\never returns to settle in his own country; and the few that do\r\nreturn, carry thither nothing that can possibly diminish the stock of\r\nSouth-Britain; for none of their treasure stagnates in Scotland--There\r\nis a continual circulation, like that of the blood in the human body,\r\nand England is the heart, to which all the streams which it distributes\r\nare refunded and returned: nay, in consequence of that luxury which our\r\nconnexion with England hath greatly encouraged, if not introduced,\r\nall the produce of our lands, and all the profits of our trade, are\r\nengrossed by the natives of South-Britain; for you will find that the\r\nexchange between the two kingdoms is always against Scotland; and\r\nthat she retains neither gold nor silver sufficient for her own\r\ncirculation.--The Scots, not content with their own manufactures and\r\nproduce, which would very well answer all necessary occasions, seem to\r\nvie with each other in purchasing superfluities from England; such as\r\nbroad-cloth, velvets, stuffs, silks, lace, furs, jewels, furniture of\r\nall sorts, sugar, rum, tea, chocolate and coffee; in a word, not only\r\nevery mode of the most extravagant luxury, but even many articles of\r\nconvenience, which they might find as good, and much cheaper in their\r\nown country. For all these particulars, I conceive, England may touch\r\nabout one million sterling a-year.--I don’t pretend to make an exact\r\ncalculation; perhaps, it may be something less, and perhaps, a great\r\ndeal more. The annual revenue arising from all the private estates of\r\nScotland cannot fall short of a million sterling; and, I should imagine,\r\ntheir trade will amount to as much more.--I know the linen manufacture\r\nalone returns near half a million, exclusive of the home-consumption\r\nof that article.--If, therefore, North-Britain pays a ballance of a\r\nmillion annually to England, I insist upon it, that country is\r\nmore valuable to her in the way of commerce, than any colony in her\r\npossession, over and above the other advantages which I have specified:\r\ntherefore, they are no friends, either to England or to truth, who\r\naffect to depreciate the northern part of the united kingdom.’\r\n\r\nI must own, I was at first a little nettled to find myself schooled in\r\nso many particulars.--Though I did not receive all his assertions\r\nas gospel, I was not prepared to refute them; and I cannot help now\r\nacquiescing in his remarks so far as to think, that the contempt for\r\nScotland, which prevails too much on this side the Tweed, is founded on\r\nprejudice and error.--After some recollection, ‘Well, captain (said I),\r\nyou have argued stoutly for the importance of your own country: for my\r\npart, I have such a regard for our fellow-subjects of North-Britain,\r\nthat I shall be glad to see the day, when your peasants can afford to\r\ngive all their oats to their cattle, hogs, and poultry, and indulge\r\nthemselves with good wheaten loaves, instead of such poor, unpalatable,\r\nand inflammatory diet.’ Here again I brought my self into a premunire\r\nwith the disputative Caledonian. He said he hoped he should never see\r\nthe common people lifted out of that sphere for which they were intended\r\nby nature and the course of things; that they might have some reason to\r\ncomplain of their bread, if it were mixed, like that of Norway, with saw\r\ndust and fish-bones; but that oatmeal was, he apprehended, as nourishing\r\nand salutary as wheat-flour, and the Scots in general thought it at\r\nleast as savoury.--He affirmed, that a mouse, which, in the article of\r\nself-preservation, might be supposed to act from infallible instinct,\r\nwould always prefer oats to wheat, as appeared from experience; for, in\r\na place where there was a parcel of each, that animal has never begun\r\nto feed upon the latter till all the oats were consumed: for their\r\nnutritive quality, he appealed to the hale, robust constitutions of\r\nthe people who lived chiefly upon oatmeal; and, instead of being\r\ninflammatory, he asserted, that it was a cooling sub-acid, balsamic and\r\nmucilaginous; insomuch, that in all inflammatory distempers, recourse\r\nwas had to water-gruel, and flummery made of oatmeal.\r\n\r\n‘At least (said I), give me leave to wish them such a degree of commerce\r\nas may enable them to follow their own inclinations.’--‘Heaven forbid!\r\n(cried this philosopher). Woe be to that nation, where the multitude is\r\nat liberty to follow their own inclinations! Commerce is undoubtedly\r\na blessing, while restrained within its proper channels; but a glut\r\nof wealth brings along with it a glut of evils: it brings false taste,\r\nfalse appetite, false wants, profusion, venality, contempt of order,\r\nengendering a spirit of licentiousness, insolence, and faction, that\r\nkeeps the community in continual ferment, and in time destroys all the\r\ndistinctions of civil society; so that universal anarchy and uproar must\r\nensue. Will any sensible man affirm, that the national advantages of\r\nopulence are to be sought on these terms?’ ‘No, sure; but I am one of\r\nthose who think, that, by proper regulations, commerce may produce every\r\nnational benefit, without the allay of such concomitant evils.’\r\n\r\nSo much for the dogmata of my friend Lismahago, whom I describe the\r\nmore circumstantially, as I firmly believe he will set up his rest in\r\nMonmouthshire. Yesterday, while I was alone with him he asked, in some\r\nconfusion, if I should have any objection to the success of a gentleman\r\nand a soldier, provided he should be so fortunate as to engage my\r\nsister’s affection. I answered without hesitation, that my sister was\r\nold enough to judge for herself; and that I should be very far from\r\ndisapproving any resolution she might take in his favour.--His eyes\r\nsparkled at this declaration. He declared, he should think himself the\r\nhappiest man on earth to be connected with my family; and that he should\r\nnever be weary of giving me proofs of his gratitude and attachment. I\r\nsuppose Tabby and he are already agreed; in which case, we shall have\r\na wedding at Brambleton-hall, and you shall give away the bride.--It is\r\nthe least thing you can do, by way of atonement for your former cruelty\r\nto that poor love-sick maiden, who has been so long a thorn in the side\r\nof\r\n\nYours, MATT. BRAMBLE Sept. 20.\r\n\r\nWe have been at Buxton; but, as I did not much relish either the company\r\nor the accommodations, and had no occasion for the water, we stayed but\r\ntwo nights in the place.\r\n\nTo Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bart. of Jesus college, Oxon.\r\n\r\nDEAR WAT,\r\n\r\nAdventures begin to thicken as we advance to the southward. Lismahago\r\nhas now professed himself the admirer of our aunt, and carries on his\r\naddresses under the sanction of her brother’s approbation; so that we\r\nshall certainly have a wedding by Christmas. I should be glad you was\r\npresent at the nuptials, to help me throw the stocking, and perform\r\nother ceremonies peculiar to that occasion.--I am sure it will be\r\nproductive of some diversion; and, truly, it would be worth your while\r\nto come across the country on purpose to see two such original figures\r\nin bed together, with their laced night caps; he, the emblem of good\r\ncheer, and she, the picture of good nature. All this agreeable prospect\r\nwas clouded, and had well nigh vanished entirely, in consequence of\r\na late misunderstanding between the future brothers-in-law, which,\r\nhowever, is now happily removed.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my uncle and I, going to visit a relation, met with lord\r\nOxmington at his house, who asked us to dine with him, next day, and we\r\naccepted the invitation.--Accordingly, leaving our women under the\r\ncare of captain Lismahago, at the inn where we had lodged the preceding\r\nnight, in a little town, about a mile from his lordship’s dwelling, we\r\nwent at the hour appointed, and had a fashionable meal served up with\r\nmuch ostentation to a company of about a dozen persons, none of whom\r\nhe had ever seen before.--His lordship is much more remarkable for his\r\npride and caprice, than for his hospitality and understanding; and,\r\nindeed, it appeared, that he considered his guests merely as objects to\r\nshine upon, so as to reflect the lustre of his own magnificence--There\r\nwas much state, but no courtesy; and a great deal of compliment without\r\nany conversation.--Before the desert was removed, our noble entertainer\r\nproposed three general toasts; then calling for a glass of wine, and\r\nbowing all round, wished us a good afternoon. This was the signal for\r\nthe company to break up, and they obeyed it immediately, all except our\r\n‘squire who was greatly shocked at the manner of this dismission--He\r\nchanged countenance, bit his lip in silence, but still kept his seat,\r\nso that his lordship found himself obliged to give us another hint, by\r\nsaying, he should be glad to see us another time. ‘There is no time like\r\nthe present (cried Mr Bramble); your lordship has not yet drank a\r\nbumper to the best in Christendom.’ ‘I’ll drink no more bumpers to-day\r\n(answered our landlord); and I am sorry to see you have drank too\r\nmany.--Order the gentleman’s carriage to the gate.’--So saying, he rose\r\nand retired abruptly; our ‘squire starting up at the same time, laying\r\nhis hand upon his sword, and eyeing him with a most ferocious aspect.\r\nThe master having vanished in this manner, our uncle bad one of the\r\nservants to see what was to pay; and the fellow answering, ‘This is no\r\ninn,’ ‘I cry you mercy (cried the other), I perceive it is not; if it\r\nwere, the landlord would be more civil. There’s a guinea, however; take\r\nit, and tell your lord, that I shall not leave the country till I\r\nhave had the opportunity to thank him in person for his politeness and\r\nhospitality.’\r\n\r\nWe then walked down stairs through a double range of lacqueys, and\r\ngetting into the chaise, proceeded homewards. Perceiving the ‘squire\r\nmuch ruffled, I ventured to disapprove of his resentment, observing,\r\nthat as lord Oxmington was well known to have his brain very ill\r\ntimbered, a sensible man should rather laugh, than be angry at his\r\nridiculous want of breeding.--Mr Bramble took umbrage at my presuming to\r\nbe wiser than he upon this occasion; and told me, that as he had always\r\nthought for himself in every occurrence in life, he would still use the\r\nsame privilege, with my good leave.\r\n\r\nWhen we returned to our inn, he closeted Lismahago; and having explained\r\nhis grievance, desired that gentleman to go and demand satisfaction of\r\nlord Oxmington in his name.--The lieutenant charged himself with this\r\ncommission, and immediately set out a horseback for his lordship’s\r\nhouse, attended, at his own request, by my man Archy Macalpine, who had\r\nbeen used to military service; and truly, if Macalpine had been mounted\r\nupon an ass, this couple might have passed for the knight of La Mancha\r\nand his ‘squire Panza. It was not till after some demur that Lismahago\r\nobtained a private audience, at which he formally defied his lordship to\r\nsingle combat, in the name of Mr Bramble, and desired him to appoint\r\nthe time and place. Lord Oxmington was so confounded at this unexpected\r\nmessage, that he could not, for some time, make any articulate reply;\r\nbut stood staring at the lieutenant with manifest marks of perturbation.\r\nAt length, ringing a bell with great vehemence, he exclaimed, ‘What!\r\na commoner send a challenge to a peer of the realm!--Privilege!\r\nprivilege!--Here’s a person brings me a challenge from the Welshman that\r\ndined at my table--An impudent fellow.--My wine is not yet out of his\r\nhead.’\r\n\r\nThe whole house was immediately in commotion.--Macalpine made a\r\nsoldierly retreat with two horses; but the captain was suddenly\r\nsurrounded and disarmed by the footmen, whom a French valet de chambre\r\nheaded in this exploit; his sword was passed through a close-stool, and\r\nhis person through the horse-pond. In this plight he returned to\r\nthe inn, half mad with his disgrace. So violent was the rage of his\r\nindignation, that he mistook its object.--He wanted to quarrel with Mr\r\nBramble; he said, he had been dishonoured on his account, and he looked\r\nfor reparation at his hands.--My uncle’s back was up in a moment; and he\r\ndesired him to explain his pretensions.--‘Either compel lord Oxmington\r\nto give me satisfaction (cried he), or give it me in your own person.’\r\n‘The latter part of the alternative is the most easy and expeditious\r\n(replied the ‘squire, starting up): if you are disposed for a walk, I’ll\r\nattend you this moment.’\r\n\r\nHere they were interrupted by Mrs Tabby, who had overheard all that\r\npassed.--She now burst into the room, and running betwixt them, in great\r\nagitation, ‘Is this your regard for me (said she to the lieutenant), to\r\nseek the life of my brother?’ Lismahago, who seemed to grow cool as my\r\nuncle grew hot, assured her he had a very great respect for Mr Bramble,\r\nbut he had still more for his own honour, which had suffered pollution;\r\nbut if that could be once purified, he should have no further cause of\r\ndissatisfaction. The ‘squire said, he should have thought it incumbent\r\nupon him to vindicate the lieutenant’s honour; but, as he had now carved\r\nfor himself, he might swallow and digest it as well as he could--In a\r\nword, what betwixt the mediation of Mrs Tabitha, the recollection of\r\nthe captain, who perceived he had gone too far, and the remonstrances\r\nof your humble servant, who joined them at this juncture, those two\r\noriginals were perfectly reconciled; and then we proceeded to deliberate\r\nupon the means of taking vengeance for the insults they had received\r\nfrom the petulant peer; for, until that aim should be accomplished,\r\nMr Bramble swore, with great emphasis, that he would not leave the inn\r\nwhere we now lodged, even if he should pass his Christmas on the spot.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of our deliberations, we next day, in the forenoon,\r\nproceeded in a body to his lordship’s house, all of us, with our\r\nservants, including the coachman, mounted a-horseback, with our pistols\r\nloaded and ready primed.--Thus prepared for action, we paraded solemnly\r\nand slowly before his lordship’s gate, which we passed three times in\r\nsuch a manner, that he could not but see us, and suspect the cause\r\nof our appearance.--After dinner we returned, and performed the same\r\ncavalcade, which was again repeated the morning following; but we had no\r\noccasion to persist in these manoeuvres. About noon, we were visited by\r\nthe gentleman, at whose house we had first seen lord Oxmington.--He now\r\ncame to make apologies in the name of his lordship, who declared he had\r\nno intention to give offence to my uncle, in practising what had been\r\nalways the custom of his house; and that as for the indignities which\r\nhad been put upon the officer, they were offered without his Lordship’s\r\nknowledge, at the instigation of his valet de chambre.--‘If that be the\r\ncase (said my uncle, in a peremptory tone), I shall be contented\r\nwith lord Oxmington’s personal excuses; and I hope my friend will be\r\nsatisfied with his lordship’s turning that insolent rascal out of his\r\nservice.’--‘Sir (cried Lismahago), I must insist upon taking personal\r\nvengeance for the personal injuries I have sustained.’\r\n\r\nAfter some debate, the affair was adjusted in this manner.--His\r\nlordship, meeting us at our friend’s house, declared he was sorry for\r\nwhat had happened; and that he had no intention to give umbrage.--The\r\nvalet de chambre asked pardon of the lieutenant upon his knees, when\r\nLismahago, to the astonishment of all present, gave him a violent kick\r\non the face, which laid him on his back, exclaiming in a furious tone,\r\n‘Oui je te pardonne, gens foutre.’\r\n\r\nSuch was the fortunate issue of this perilous adventure, which\r\nthreatened abundance of vexation to our family; for the ‘squire is one\r\nof those who will sacrifice both life and fortune, rather than leave\r\nwhat they conceive to be the least speck or blemish upon their honour\r\nand reputation. His lordship had no sooner pronounced his apology, with\r\na very bad grace, than he went away in some disorder, and, I dare say,\r\nhe will never invite another Welchman to his table.\r\n\r\nWe forthwith quitted the field of this atchievement, in order to\r\nprosecute our journey; but we follow no determinate course. We make\r\nsmall deviations, to see the remarkable towns, villas, and curiosities\r\non each side of our route; so that we advance by slow steps towards the\r\nborders of Monmouthshire: but in the midst of these irregular motions,\r\nthere is no abberration nor eccentricity in that affection with which I\r\nam, dear Wat,\r\n\nYours always, J. MELFORD Sept. 28.\r\n\nTo Dr LEWIS.\r\n\r\nDEAR DICK,\r\n\r\nAt what time of life may a man think himself exempted from the necessity\r\nof sacrificing his repose to the punctilios of a contemptible world? I\r\nhave been engaged in a ridiculous adventure, which I shall recount at\r\nmeeting; and this, I hope, will not be much longer delayed, as we have\r\nnow performed almost all our visits, and seen every thing that I think\r\nhas any right to retard us in our journey homewards--A few days ago,\r\nunderstanding by accident, that my old friend Baynard was in the\r\ncountry, I would not pass so near his habitation without paying him a\r\nvisit, though our correspondence had been interrupted for a long course\r\nof years.\r\n\r\nI felt my self very sensibly affected by the idea of our past intimacy,\r\nas we approached the place where we had spent so many happy days\r\ntogether; but when we arrived at the house, I could not recognize\r\nany one of those objects, which had been so deeply impressed upon my\r\nremembrance--The tall oaks that shaded the avenue, had been cut down,\r\nand the iron gates at the end of it removed, together with the high wall\r\nthat surrounded the court yard. The house itself, which was formerly a\r\nconvent of Cistercian monks, had a venerable appearance: and along the\r\nfront that looked into the garden, was a stone gallery, which afforded\r\nme many an agreeable walk, when I was disposed to be contemplative. Now\r\nthe old front is covered with a screen of modern architecture; so that\r\nall without is Grecian, and all within Gothic. As for the garden, which\r\nwas well stocked with the best fruit which England could produce,\r\nthere is not now the least vestage remaining of trees, walls, or\r\nhedges--Nothing appears but a naked circus of loose sand, with a dry\r\nbason and a leaden triton in the middle.\r\n\r\nYou must know, that Baynard, at his father’s death, had a clear estate\r\nof fifteen hundred pounds a-year, and was in other respects extremely\r\nwell qualified to make a respectable figure in the commonwealth;\r\nbut, what with some excesses of youth, and the expence of a contested\r\nelection, he in a few years found himself encumbered with a debt of ten\r\nthousand pounds, which he resolved to discharge by means of a prudent\r\nmarriage. He accordingly married a miss Thomson, whose fortune amounted\r\nto double the sum that he owed--She was the daughter of a citizen, who\r\nhad failed in trade; but her fortune came by an uncle, who died in the\r\nEast-Indies--Her own parents being dead, she lived with a maiden aunt,\r\nwho had superintended her education; and, in all appearance, was well\r\nenough qualified for the usual purposes of the married state--Her\r\nvirtues, however, stood rather upon a negative, than a positive\r\nfoundation--She was neither proud, insolent, nor capricious, nor given\r\nto scandal, nor addicted to gaming, nor inclined to gallantry. She could\r\nread, and write, and dance, and sing, and play upon the harpsichord,\r\nand smatter French, and take a hand at whist and ombre; but even these\r\naccomplishments she possessed by halves--She excelled in nothing.\r\nHer conversation was flat, her stile mean, and her expression\r\nembarrassed--In a word, her character was totally insipid. Her person\r\nwas not disagreeable; but there was nothing graceful in her address, nor\r\nengaging in her manners; and she was so ill qualified to do the honours\r\nof the house, that when she sat at the head of the table, one was always\r\nlooking for the mistress of the family in some other place.\r\n\r\nBaynard had flattered himself, that it would be no difficult matter\r\nto mould such a subject after his own fashion, and that she would\r\nchearfully enter into his views, which were wholly turned to domestic\r\nhappiness. He proposed to reside always in the country, of which he was\r\nfond to a degree of enthusiasm; to cultivate his estate, which was very\r\nimprovable; to enjoy the exercise of rural diversions; to maintain an\r\nintimacy of correspondence with some friends that were settled in\r\nhis neighbourhood; to keep a comfortable house, without suffering his\r\nexpence to exceed the limits of his income; and to find pleasure and\r\nemploy merit for his wife in the management and avocations of her own\r\nfamily--This, however, was a visionary scheme, which he never was able\r\nto realize. His wife was as ignorant as a new-born babe of everything\r\nthat related to the conduct of a family; and she had no idea of a\r\ncountry-life. Her understanding did not reach so far as to comprehend\r\nthe first principles of discretion; and, indeed, if her capacity had\r\nbeen better than it was, her natural indolence would not have permitted\r\nher to abandon a certain routine, to which she had been habituated. She\r\nhad not taste enough to relish any rational enjoyment; but her ruling\r\npassion was vanity, not that species which arises from self-conceit\r\nof superior accomplishments, but that which is of a bastard and idiot\r\nnature, excited by shew and ostentation, which implies not even the\r\nleast consciousness of any personal merit.\r\n\r\nThe nuptial peal of noise and nonsense being rung out in all the usual\r\nchanges, Mr Baynard thought it high time to make her acquainted with\r\nthe particulars of the plan which he had projected--He told her that his\r\nfortune, though sufficient to afford all the comforts of life, was not\r\nample enough to command all the superfluities of pomp and pageantry,\r\nwhich, indeed, were equally absurd and intolerable--He therefore hoped\r\nshe would have no objection to their leaving London in the spring, when\r\nhe would take the opportunity to dismiss some unnecessary domestics,\r\nwhom he had hired for the occasion of their marriage--She heard him in\r\nsilence, and after some pause, ‘So (said she) I am to be buried in the\r\ncountry!’ He was so confounded at this reply, that he could not speak\r\nfor some minutes: at length he told her, he was much mortified to find\r\nhe had proposed anything that was disagreeable to her ideas--‘I am sure\r\n(added he) I meant nothing more than to lay down a comfortable plan of\r\nliving within the bounds of our fortune, which is but moderate.’ ‘Sir\r\n(said she), you are the best judge of your own affairs--My fortune,\r\nI know, does not exceed twenty thousand pounds--Yet, even with that\r\npittance, I might have had a husband who would not have begrudged me a\r\nhouse in London’--‘Good God! my dear (cried poor Baynard, in the\r\nutmost agitation), you don’t think me so sordid--I only hinted what I\r\nthought--But, I don’t pretend to impose--’ ‘Yes, sir (resumed the lady),\r\nit is your prerogative to command, and my duty to obey’ So saying, she\r\nburst into tears and retired to her chamber, where she was joined by her\r\naunt--He endeavoured to recollect himself, and act with vigour of mind\r\non this occasion; but was betrayed by the tenderness of his nature,\r\nwhich was the greatest defect of his constitution. He found the aunt\r\nin tears, and the niece in a fit, which held her the best part of eight\r\nhours, at the expiration of which, she began to talk incoherently about\r\ndeath and her dear husband, who had sat by her all this time, and now\r\npressed her hand to his lips, in a transport of grief and penitence\r\nfor the offence he had given--From thence forward, he carefully avoided\r\nmentioning the country; and they continued to be sucked deeper and\r\ndeeper into the vortex of extravagance and dissipation, leading what\r\nis called a fashionable life in town--About the latter end of July,\r\nhowever, Mrs Baynard, in order to exhibit a proof of conjugal obedience,\r\ndesired of her own accord, that they might pay a visit to his country\r\nhouse, as there was no company left in London. He would have excused\r\nhimself from this excursion which was no part of the oeconomical plan he\r\nhad proposed; but she insisted upon making this sacrifice to his taste\r\nand prejudices, and away they went with such an equipage as astonished\r\nthe whole country. All that remained of the season was engrossed by\r\nreceiving and returning visits in the neighbourhood; and, in\r\nthis intercourse it was discovered that sir John Chickwell had a\r\nhouse-steward and one footman in livery more than the complement of\r\nMr Baynard’s household. This remark was made by the aunt at table, and\r\nassented to by the husband, who observed that sir John Chickwell might\r\nvery well afford to keep more servants than were found in the family\r\nof a man who had not half his fortune. Mrs Baynard ate no supper that\r\nevening; but was seized with a violent fit, which completed her triumph\r\nover the spirit of her consort. The two supernumerary servants were\r\nadded--The family plate was sold for old silver, and a new service\r\nprocured; fashionable furniture was provided, and the whole house turned\r\ntopsy turvy.\r\n\r\nAt their return to London in the beginning of winter, he, with a heavy\r\nheart, communicated these particulars to me in confidence. Before his\r\nmarriage, he had introduced me to the lady as his particular friend;\r\nand I now offered in that character, to lay before her the necessity of\r\nreforming her oeconomy, if she had any regard to the interest of her own\r\nfamily, or complaisance for the inclinations of her husband--But Baynard\r\ndeclined my offer, on the supposition that his wife’s nerves were\r\ntoo delicate to bear expostulation; and that it would only serve to\r\noverwhelm her with such distress as would make himself miserable.\r\n\r\nBaynard is a man of spirit, and had she proved a termagant, he would\r\nhave known how to deal with her; but, either by accident or instinct,\r\nshe fastened upon the weak side of his soul, and held it so fast, that\r\nhe has been in subjection ever since--I afterwards advised him to carry\r\nher abroad to France or Italy, where he might gratify her vanity for\r\nhalf the expence it cost him in England: and this advice he followed\r\naccordingly. She was agreeably flattered with the idea of seeing and\r\nknowing foreign parts, and foreign fashions; of being presented to\r\nsovereigns, and living familiarly with princes. She forthwith seized the\r\nhint which I had thrown out on purpose, and even pressed Mr Baynard to\r\nhasten his departure; so that in a few weeks they crossed the sea to\r\nFrance, with a moderate train, still including the aunt; who was\r\nher bosom counsellor, and abetted her in all her oppositions to her\r\nhusband’s will--Since that period, I have had little or no opportunity\r\nto renew our former correspondence--All that I knew of his transactions,\r\namounted to no more than that after an absence of two years, they\r\nreturned so little improved in oeconomy, that they launched out into\r\nnew oceans of extravagance, which at length obliged him to mortgage his\r\nestate--By this time she had bore him three children, of which the last\r\nonly survives, a puny boy of twelve or thirteen, who will be ruined in\r\nhis education by the indulgence of his mother.\r\n\r\nAs for Baynard, neither his own good sense, nor the dread of indigence,\r\nnor the consideration of his children, has been of force sufficient to\r\nstimulate him into the resolution of breaking at once the shameful spell\r\nby which he seems enchanted--With a taste capable of the most refined\r\nenjoyment, a heart glowing with all the warmth of friendship and\r\nhumanity, and a disposition strongly turned to the more rational\r\npleasures of a retired and country life, he is hurried about in a\r\nperpetual tumult, amidst a mob of beings pleased with rattles, baubles,\r\nand gewgaws, so void of sense and distinction, that even the most acute\r\nphilosopher would find it a very hard task to discover for what wise\r\npurpose of providence they were created--Friendship is not to be found;\r\nnor can the amusements for which he sighs be enjoyed within the rotation\r\nof absurdity, to which he is doomed for life. He has long resigned\r\nall views of improving his fortune by management and attention to\r\nthe exercise of husbandry, in which he delighted; and as to domestic\r\nhappiness, not the least glimpse of hope remains to amuse his\r\nimagination. Thus blasted in all his prospects, he could not fail to\r\nbe overwhelmed with melancholy and chagrin, which have preyed upon his\r\nhealth and spirits in such a manner, that he is now threatened with a\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\nI have given you a sketch of the man, whom the other day I went to\r\nvisit--At the gate we found a great number of powdered lacquies, but\r\nno civility--After we had sat a considerable time in the coach, we were\r\ntold, that Mr Baynard had rode out, and that his lady was dressing; but\r\nwe were introduced to a parlour, so very fine and delicate, that in all\r\nappearance it was designed to be seen only, not inhabited. The chairs\r\nand couches were carved, gilt, and covered with rich damask, so smooth\r\nand slick, that they looked as if they had never been sat upon. There\r\nwas no carpet upon the floor, but the boards were rubbed and waxed in\r\nsuch a manner, that we could not walk, but were obliged to slide\r\nalong them; and as for the stove, it was too bright and polished to be\r\npolluted with sea-coal, or stained by the smoke of any gross material\r\nfire--When we had remained above half an hour sacrificing to the\r\ninhospitable powers in the temple of cold reception, my friend Baynard\r\narrived, and understanding we were in the house, made his appearance, so\r\nmeagre, yellow, and dejected, that I really should not have known him,\r\nhad I met with him in any other place. Running up to me, with great\r\neagerness, he strained me in his embrace, and his heart was so full,\r\nthat for some minutes he could not speak. Having saluted us all round,\r\nhe perceived our uncomfortable situation, and conducting us into another\r\napartment, which had fire in the chimney, called for chocolate--Then,\r\nwithdrawing, he returned with a compliment from his wife, and, in the\r\nmean time, presented his son Harry, a shambling, blear-eyed boy, in the\r\nhabit of a hussar; very rude, forward, and impertinent. His father would\r\nhave sent him to a boarding-school, but his mamma and aunt would not\r\nhear of his lying out of the house; so that there was a clergyman\r\nengaged as his tutor in the family.\r\n\r\nAs it was but just turned of twelve, and the whole house was in\r\ncommotion to prepare a formal entertainment, I foresaw it would be\r\nlate before we dined, and proposed a walk to Mr Baynard, that we might\r\nconverse together freely. In the course of this perambulation, when I\r\nexpressed some surprize that he had returned so soon from Italy, he\r\ngave me to understand, that his going abroad had not at all answered the\r\npurpose, for which he left England; that although the expence of living\r\nwas not so great in Italy as at home, respect being had to the same rank\r\nof life in both countries, it had been found necessary for him to lift\r\nhimself above his usual stile, that he might be on some footing with\r\nthe counts, marquises, and cavaliers, with whom he kept company--He was\r\nobliged to hire a great number of servants, to take off a great variety\r\nof rich cloaths, and to keep a sumptuous table for the fashionable\r\nscorocconi of the country; who, without a consideration of this kind,\r\nwould not have payed any attention to an untitled foreigner, let his\r\nfamily or fortune be ever so respectable--Besides, Mrs Baynard was\r\ncontinually surrounded by a train of expensive loungers, under the\r\ndenominations of language-masters, musicians, painters, and ciceroni;\r\nand had actually fallen into the disease of buying pictures and antiques\r\nupon her own judgment, which was far from being infallible--At length\r\nshe met with an affront, which gave her disgust to Italy, and drove her\r\nback to England with some precipitation. By means of frequenting the\r\ndutchess of B[edford]'s conversazione, while her grace was at Rome, Mrs\r\nBaynard became acquainted with all the fashionable people of that city,\r\nand was admitted to their assemblies without scruple--Thus favoured, she\r\nconceived too great an idea of her own importance, and when the dutchess\r\nleft Rome, resolved to have a conversazione that should leave the\r\nRomans no room to regret her grace’s departure. She provided hands for a\r\nmusical entertainment, and sent biglietti of invitation to every person\r\nof distinction; but not one Roman of the female sex appeared at her\r\nassembly--She was that night seized with a violent fit, and kept her\r\nbed three days, at the expiration of which she declared that the air of\r\nItaly would be the ruin of her constitution. In order to prevent this\r\ncatastrophe, she was speedily removed to Geneva, from whence they\r\nreturned to England by the way of Lyons and Paris. By the time they\r\narrived at Calais, she had purchased such a quantity of silks, stuffs,\r\nand laces, that it was necessary to hire a vessel to smuggle them over,\r\nand this vessel was taken by a custom-house cutter; so that they lost\r\nthe whole cargo, which had cost them above eight hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nIt now appears, that her travels had produced no effect upon her, but\r\nthat of making her more expensive and fantastic than ever: She affected\r\nto lead the fashion, not only in point of female dress, but in every\r\narticle of taste and connoisseurship. She made a drawing of the new\r\nfacade to the house in the country; she pulled up the trees, and pulled\r\ndown the walls of the garden, so as to let in the easterly wind, which\r\nMr Baynard’s ancestors had been at great pains to exclude. To shew her\r\ntaste in laying out ground, she seized into her own hand a farm of two\r\nhundred acres, about a mile from the house, which she parcelled out into\r\nwalks and shrubberies, having a great bason in the middle, into which\r\nshe poured a whole stream that turned two mills, and afforded the best\r\ntrout in the country. The bottom of the bason, however, was so ill\r\nsecured, that it would not hold the water which strained through the\r\nearth, and made a bog of the whole plantation: in a word, the ground\r\nwhich formerly payed him one hundred and fifty pounds a year, now cost\r\nhim two hundred pounds a year to keep it in tolerable order, over and\r\nabove the first expence of trees, shrubs, flowers, turf, and gravel.\r\nThere was not an inch of garden ground left about the house, nor a tree\r\nthat produced fruit of any kind; nor did he raise a truss of hay, or a\r\nbushel of oats for his horses, nor had he a single cow to afford milk\r\nfor his tea; far less did he ever dream of feeding his own mutton,\r\npigs, and poultry: every article of housekeeping, even the most\r\ninconsiderable, was brought from the next market town, at the distance\r\nof five miles, and thither they sent a courier every morning to fetch\r\nhot rolls for breakfast. In short, Baynard fairly owned that he spent\r\ndouble his income, and that in a few years he should be obliged to sell\r\nhis estate for the payment of his creditors. He said that his wife had\r\nsuch delicate nerves, and such imbecility of spirit, that she could\r\nneither bear remonstrance, be it ever so gentle, nor practise any scheme\r\nof retrenchment, even if she perceived the necessity of such a measure.\r\nHe had therefore ceased struggling against the stream, and endeavoured\r\nto reconcile himself to ruin, by reflecting that his child at least\r\nwould inherit his mother’s fortune, which was secured to him by the\r\ncontract of marriage.\r\n\r\nThe detail which he gave me of his affairs, filled me at once with grief\r\nand indignation. I inveighed bitterly against the indiscretion of his\r\nwife, and reproached him with his unmanly acquiescence under the absurd\r\ntyranny which she exerted. I exhorted him to recollect his resolution,\r\nand make one effectual effort to disengage himself from a thraldom,\r\nequally shameful and pernicious. I offered him all the assistance in my\r\npower. I undertook to regulate his affairs, and even to bring about a\r\nreformation in his family, if he would only authorise me to execute the\r\nplan I should form for his advantage. I was so affected by the subject,\r\nthat I could not help mingling tears with my remonstrances, and Baynard\r\nwas so penetrated with these marks of my affection, that he lost all\r\npower of utterance. He pressed me to his breast with great emotion, and\r\nwept in silence. At length he exclaimed, ‘Friendship is undoubtedly the\r\nmost precious balm of life! Your words, dear Bramble, have in a great\r\nmeasure recalled me from an abyss of despondence, in which I have\r\nbeen long overwhelmed. I will, upon honour, make you acquainted with\r\na distinct state of my affairs, and, as far as I am able to go, will\r\nfollow the course you prescribe. But there are certain lengths which my\r\nnature--The truth is, there are tender connexions, of which a batchelor\r\nhas no idea--Shall I own my weakness? I cannot bear the thoughts of\r\nmaking that woman uneasy’--‘And yet (cried I), she has seen you unhappy\r\nfor a series of years--unhappy from her misconduct, without ever shewing\r\nthe least inclination to alleviate your distress’--‘Nevertheless (said\r\nhe) I am persuaded she loves me with the most warm affection; but these\r\nare incongruities in the composition of the human mind which I hold to\r\nbe inexplicable.’\r\n\r\nI was shocked at his infatuation, and changed the subject, after we had\r\nagreed to maintain a close correspondence for the future. He then gave\r\nme to understand, that he had two neighbours, who, like himself, were\r\ndriven by their wives at full speed, in the high road to bankruptcy and\r\nruin. All the three husbands were of dispositions very different from\r\neach other, and, according to this variation, their consorts were\r\nadmirably suited to the purpose of keeping them all three in subjection.\r\nThe views of the ladies were exactly the same. They vied in grandeur,\r\nthat is, in ostentation, with the wife of Sir Charles Chickwell, who had\r\nfour times their fortune; and she again piqued herself upon making an\r\nequal figure with a neighbouring peeress, whose revenue trebled her\r\nown. Here then was the fable of the frog and the ox, realized in four\r\ndifferent instances within the same county: one large fortune, and\r\nthree moderate estates, in a fair way of being burst by the inflation of\r\nfemale vanity; and in three of these instances, three different forms of\r\nfemale tyranny were exercised. Mr Baynard was subjugated by practising\r\nupon the tenderness of his nature. Mr Milksan, being of a timorous\r\ndisposition, truckled to the insolence of a termagant. Mr Sowerby, who\r\nwas of a temper neither to be moved by fits, nor driven by menaces,\r\nhad the fortune to be fitted with a helpmate, who assailed him with\r\nthe weapons of irony and satire; sometimes sneering in the way of\r\ncompliment; sometimes throwing out sarcastic comparisons, implying\r\nreproaches upon his want of taste, spirit, and generosity: by which\r\nmeans she stimulated his passions from one act of extravagance to\r\nanother, just as the circumstances of her vanity required.\r\n\r\nAll these three ladies have at this time the same number of horses,\r\ncarriages, and servants in and out of livery; the same variety of dress;\r\nthe same quantity of plate and china; the like ornaments in furniture:\r\nand in their entertainments they endeavour to exceed one another in the\r\nvariety, delicacy, and expence of their dishes. I believe it will be\r\nfound upon enquiry, that nineteen out of twenty, who are ruined by\r\nextravagance, fall a sacrifice to the ridiculous pride and vanity of\r\nsilly women, whose parts are held in contempt by the very men whom they\r\npillage and enslave. Thank heaven, Dick, that among all the follies\r\nand weaknesses of human nature, I have not yet fallen into that of\r\nmatrimony.\r\n\r\nAfter Baynard and I had discussed all these matters at leisure, we\r\nreturned towards the house, and met Jery with our two women, who had\r\ncome forth to take the air, as the lady of the mansion had not yet made\r\nher appearance. In short, Mrs Baynard did not produce herself, till\r\nabout a quarter of an hour before dinner was upon the table. Then her\r\nhusband brought her into the parlour, accompanied by her aunt and son,\r\nand she received us with a coldness of reserve sufficient to freeze the\r\nvery soul of hospitality. Though she knew I had been the intimate friend\r\nof her husband, and had often seen me with him in London, she shewed no\r\nmarks of recognition or regard, when I addressed myself to her in the\r\nmost friendly terms of salutation. She did not even express the common\r\ncompliment of, I am glad to see you; or, I hope you have enjoyed your\r\nhealth since we had the pleasure of seeing you; or some such words of\r\ncourse: nor did she once open her mouth in the way of welcome to my\r\nsister and my niece: but sat in silence like a statue, with an aspect of\r\ninsensibility. Her aunt, the model upon which she had been formed, was\r\nindeed the very essence of insipid formality but the boy was very pert\r\nand impudent, and prated without ceasing.\r\n\r\nAt dinner, the lady maintained the same ungracious indifference, never\r\nspeaking but in whispers to her aunt; and as to the repast, it was made\r\nup of a parcel of kickshaws, contrived by a French cook, without one\r\nsubstantial article adapted to the satisfaction of an English appetite.\r\nThe pottage was little better than bread soaked in dishwashings,\r\nlukewarm. The ragouts looked as if they had been once eaten and half\r\ndigested: the fricassees were involved in a nasty yellow poultice: and\r\nthe rotis were scorched and stinking, for the honour of the fumet. The\r\ndesert consisted of faded fruit and iced froth, a good emblem of our\r\nlandlady’s character; the table-beer was sour, the water foul, and the\r\nwine vapid; but there was a parade of plate and china, and a powdered\r\nlacquey stood behind every chair, except those of the master and\r\nmistress of the house, who were served by two valets dressed like\r\ngentlemen. We dined in a large old Gothic parlour, which was formerly\r\nthe hall. It was now paved with marble, and, notwithstanding the fire\r\nwhich had been kindled about an hour, struck me with such a chill\r\nsensation, that when I entered it the teeth chattered in my jaws--In\r\nshort, every thing was cold, comfortless, and disgusting, except the\r\nlooks of my friend Baynard, which declared the warmth of his affection\r\nand humanity.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner we withdrew into another apartment, where the boy began to\r\nbe impertinently troublesome to my niece Liddy. He wanted a playfellow,\r\nforsooth; and would have romped with her, had she encouraged his\r\nadvances--He was even so impudent as to snatch a kiss, at which she\r\nchanged countenance, and seemed uneasy; and though his father checked\r\nhim for the rudeness of his behaviour, he became so outrageous as to\r\nthrust his hand in her bosom: an insult to which she did not tamely\r\nsubmit, though one of the mildest creatures upon earth. Her eyes\r\nsparkling with resentment, she started up, and lent him such a box in\r\nthe ear, as sent him staggering to the other side of the room.\r\n\r\n‘Miss Melford (cried his father), you have treated him with the utmost\r\npropriety--I am only sorry that the impertinence of any child of mine\r\nshould have occasioned this exertion of your spirit, which I cannot but\r\napplaud and admire.’ His wife was so far from assenting to the candour\r\nof his apology, that she rose from the table, and, taking her son by the\r\nhand, ‘Come, child (said she), your father cannot abide you.’ So\r\nsaying, she retired with this hopeful youth, and was followed by her\r\ngouvernante: but neither the one nor the other deigned to take the least\r\nnotice of the company.\r\n\r\nBaynard was exceedingly disconcerted; but I perceived his uneasiness was\r\ntinctured with resentment, and derived a good omen from this discovery.\r\nI ordered the horses to be put to the carriage, and, though he made\r\nsome efforts to detain us all night, I insisted upon leaving the house\r\nimmediately; but, before I went away, I took an opportunity of speaking\r\nto him again in private. I said every thing I could recollect, to\r\nanimate his endeavours in shaking off those shameful trammels. I made\r\nno scruple to declare, that his wife was unworthy of that tender\r\ncomplaisance which he had shewn for her foibles: that she was dead to\r\nall the genuine sentiments of conjugal affection; insensible of her\r\nown honour and interest, and seemingly destitute of common sense and\r\nreflection. I conjured him to remember what he owed to his father’s\r\nhouse, to his own reputation, and to his family, including even this\r\nunreasonable woman herself, who was driving on blindly to her own\r\ndestruction. I advised him to form a plan for retrenching superfluous\r\nexpence, and try to convince the aunt of the necessity for such\r\na reformation, that she might gradually prepare her niece for its\r\nexecution; and I exhorted him to turn that disagreeable piece of\r\nformality out of the house, if he should find her averse to his\r\nproposal.\r\n\r\nHere he interrupted me with a sigh, observing that such a step would\r\nundoubtedly be fatal to Mrs Baynard--‘I shall lose all patience (cried\r\nI), to hear you talk so weakly--Mrs Baynard’s fits will never hurt her\r\nconstitution. I believe in my conscience they are all affected: I am\r\nsure she has no feeling for your distresses; and, when you are ruined,\r\nshe will appear to have no feeling for her own.’ Finally, I took his\r\nword and honour that he would make an effort, such as I had advised;\r\nthat he would form a plan of oeconomy, and, if he found it impracticable\r\nwithout my assistance, he would come to Bath in the winter, where I\r\npromised to give him the meeting, and contribute all in my power to the\r\nretrieval of his affairs--With this mutual engagement we parted; and I\r\nshall think myself supremely happy, if, by my means, a worthy man, whom\r\nI love and esteem, can be saved from misery, disgrace, and despair.\r\n\r\nI have only one friend more to visit in this part of the country, but he\r\nis of a complexion very different from that of Baynard. You have heard\r\nme mention Sir Thomas Bullford, whom I knew in Italy. He is now become\r\na country gentleman; but, being disabled by the gout from enjoying any\r\namusement abroad, he entertains himself within doors, by keeping open\r\nhouse for all corners, and playing upon the oddities and humours of his\r\ncompany: but he himself is generally the greatest original at his table.\r\nHe is very good-humoured, talks much, and laughs without ceasing. I am\r\ntold that all the use he makes of his understanding at present, is to\r\nexcite mirth, by exhibiting his guests in ludicrous attitudes. I know\r\nnot how far we may furnish him with entertainment of this kind, but I am\r\nresolved to beat up his quarters, partly with a view to laugh with\r\nthe knight himself, and partly to pay my respects to his lady, a\r\ngood-natured sensible woman, with whom he lives upon very easy terms,\r\nalthough she has not had the good fortune to bring him an heir to his\r\nestate.\r\n\r\nAnd now, dear Dick, I must tell you for your comfort, that you are the\r\nonly man upon earth to whom I would presume to send such a longwinded\r\nepistle, which I could not find in my heart to curtail, because the\r\nsubject interested the warmest passions of my heart; neither will I make\r\nany other apology to a correspondent who has been so long accustomed to\r\nthe impertinence of\r\n\r\nMATT. BRAMBLE Sept. 30.\r\n\nTo Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bart. at Oxon.\r\n\r\nDEAR KNIGHT,\r\n\r\nI believe there is something mischievous in my disposition, for nothing\r\ndiverts me so much as to see certain characters tormented with false\r\nterrors.--We last night lodged at the house of Sir Thomas Bullford, an\r\nold friend of my uncle, a jolly fellow, of moderate intellects, who, in\r\nspite of the gout, which hath lamed him, is resolved to be merry to the\r\nlast; and mirth he has a particular knack in extracting from his guests,\r\nlet their humour be ever so caustic or refractory.--Besides our company,\r\nthere was in the house a fat-headed justice of the peace, called\r\nFrogmore, and a country practitioner in surgery, who seemed to be our\r\nlandlord’s chief companion and confidant.--We found the knight sitting\r\non a couch, with his crutches by his side, and his feet supported on\r\ncushions; but he received us with a hearty welcome, and seemed greatly\r\nrejoiced at our arrival.--After tea, we were entertained with a sonata\r\non the harpsichord by lady Bullford, who sung and played to admiration;\r\nbut Sir Thomas seemed to be a little asinine in the article of ears,\r\nthough he affected to be in raptures, and begged his wife to favour us\r\nwith an arietta of her own composing.--This arietta, however, she no\r\nsooner began to perform, than he and the justice fell asleep; but the\r\nmoment she ceased playing, the knight waked snorting, and exclaimed,\r\n‘O cara! what d’ye think, gentlemen? Will you talk any more of your\r\nPargolesi and your Corelli?’--At the same time, he thrust his tongue in\r\none cheek, and leered with one eye at the doctor and me, who sat on his\r\nleft hand. He concluded the pantomime with a loud laugh, which he could\r\ncommand at all times extempore.--Notwithstanding his disorder, he did\r\nnot do penance at supper, nor did he ever refuse his glass when the\r\ntoast went round, but rather encouraged a quick circulation, both by\r\nprecept and example.\r\n\r\nI soon perceived the doctor had made himself very necessary to the\r\nbaronet.--He was the whetstone of his wit, the butt of his satire, and\r\nhis operator in certain experiments of humour, which were occasionally\r\ntried upon strangers.--Justice Frogmore was an excellent subject for\r\nthis species of philosophy; sleek and corpulent, solemn, and shallow,\r\nhe had studied Burn with uncommon application, but he studied nothing\r\nso much as the art of living (that is, eating) well--This fat buck had\r\noften afforded good sport to our landlord; and he was frequently started\r\nwith tolerable success, in the course of this evening; but the baronet’s\r\nappetite for ridicule seemed to be chiefly excited by the appearance,\r\naddress, and conversation of Lismahago, whom he attempted in all\r\ndifferent modes of exposition; but he put me in mind of a contest that I\r\nonce saw betwixt a young hound and an old hedge-hog--The dog turned him\r\nover and over, and bounced and barked, and mumbled; but as often as\r\nhe attempted to bite, he felt a prickle in his jaws, and recoiled in\r\nmanifest confusion;--The captain, when left to himself, will not fail to\r\nturn his ludicrous side to the company, but if any man attempts to force\r\nhim into that attitude, he becomes stubborn as a mule, and unmanageable\r\nas an elephant unbroke.\r\n\r\nDivers tolerable jokes were cracked upon the justice, who eat a most\r\nunconscionable supper, and, among other things, a large plate of broiled\r\nmushrooms, which he had no sooner swallowed than the doctor observed,\r\nwith great gravity, that they were of the kind called champignons, which\r\nin some constitutions has a poisonous effect.--Mr Frogmore startled at\r\nthis remark, asked, in some confusion, why he had not been so kind as to\r\ngive him that notice sooner.--He answered, that he took it for granted,\r\nby his eating them so heartily, that he was used to the dish; but as he\r\nseemed to be under some apprehension, he prescribed a bumper of plague\r\nwater, which the justice drank off immediately, and retired to rest, not\r\nwithout marks of terror and disquiet.\r\n\r\nAt midnight we were shewn to our different chambers, and in half an\r\nhour, I was fast asleep in bed; but about three o’clock in the morning I\r\nwas waked with a dismal cry of Fire! and starting up, ran to the window\r\nin my shirt.--The night was dark and stormy; and a number of people\r\nhalf-dressed ran backwards and forwards thro’ the court-yard, with links\r\nand lanthorns, seemingly in the utmost hurry and trepidation.--Slipping\r\non my cloaths in a twinkling, I ran down stairs, and, upon enquiry,\r\nfound the fire was confined to a back-stair, which led to a detached\r\napartment where Lismahago lay.--By this time, the lieutenant was alarmed\r\nby bawling at his window, which was in the second story, but he could\r\nnot find his cloaths in the dark, and his room-door was locked on the\r\noutside.--The servants called to him, that the house had been robbed;\r\nthat, without all doubt, the villains had taken away his cloaths,\r\nfastened the door, and set the house on fire, for the stair-case was in\r\nflames.--In this dilemma the poor lieutenant ran about the room naked\r\nlike a squirrel in a cage, popping out his bead at the window between\r\nwhiles, and imploring assistance.--At length, the knight in person\r\nwas brought out in his chair, attended by my uncle and all the family,\r\nincluding our aunt Tabitha, who screamed, and cried, and tore her hair,\r\nas if she had been distracted--Sir Thomas had already ordered his people\r\nto bring a long ladder which was applied to the captain’s, window, and\r\nnow he exhorted him earnestly to descend.--There was no need of much\r\nrhetoric to persuade Lismahago, who forthwith made his exit by the\r\nwindow, roaring all the time to the people below to hold fast the\r\nladder.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the gravity of the occasion, it was impossible to behold\r\nthis scene without being seized with an inclination to laugh. The rueful\r\naspect of the lieutenant in his shirt, with a quilted night-cap fastened\r\nunder his chin, and his long lank limbs and posteriors exposed to the\r\nwind, made a very picturesque appearance, when illumined by the links\r\nand torches which the servants held up to light him in his descent.--All\r\nthe company stood round the ladder, except the knight, who sat in his\r\nchair, exclaiming from time to time, ‘Lord, have mercy upon us!--save\r\nthe gentleman’s life!--mind your footing, dear captain! softly!--stand\r\nfast!--clasp the ladder with both hands!--there!--well done, my dear\r\nboy!--O bravo!--an old soldier for ever!--bring a blanket bring a\r\nwarm blanket to comfort his poor carcase--warm the bed in the green\r\nroom--give me your hand, dear captain--I’m rejoiced to see thee safe\r\nand sound with all my heart.’ Lismahago was received at the foot of the\r\nladder by his inamorata, who snatching a blanket from one of the maids,\r\nwrapped it about his body; two men-servants took him under the arms,\r\nand a female conducted him to the green room, still accompanied by Mrs\r\nTabitha, who saw him fairly put to bed.--During this whole transaction\r\nhe spoke not a syllable, but looked exceeding grim, sometimes at one,\r\nsometimes at another of the spectators, who now adjourned in a body to\r\nthe parlour where we had supped, every one surveying another with marks\r\nof astonishment and curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe knight being seated in an easy chair, seized my uncle by the hand,\r\nand bursting into a long and loud laugh, ‘Matt (cried he), crown me with\r\noak, or ivy, or laurel, or parsely, or what you will, and acknowledge\r\nthis to be a coup de maitre in the way of waggery--ha, ha, ha!--Such a\r\ncamisciata, scagliata, beffata! O, che roba! O, what a subject!--O, what\r\ncaricatura!--O, for a Rosa, a Rembrandt, a Schalken!--Zooks, I’ll give a\r\nhundred guineas to have it painted!--what a fine descent from the cross,\r\nor ascent to the gallows! what lights and shadows!--what a groupe below!\r\nwhat expression above!--what an aspect!--did you mind the aspect? ha,\r\nha, ha!--and the limbs, and the muscles every toe denoted terror! ha,\r\nha, ha!--then the blanket! O, what costume! St Andrew! St Lazarus! St\r\nBarrabas!--ha, ha, ha!’ ‘After all then (cried Mr Bramble very gravely),\r\nthis was no more than a false alarm.--We have been frightened out of our\r\nbeds, and almost out of our senses, for the joke’s sake.’ ‘Ay, and such\r\na joke! (cried our landlord) such a farce! such a denouement! such a\r\ncatastrophe!’\r\n\r\n‘Have a little patience (replied our ‘squire); we are not yet come to\r\nthe catastrophe; and pray God it may not turn out a tragedy instead of a\r\nfarce.--The captain is one of those saturnine subjects, who have no\r\nidea of humour.--He never laughs in his own person; nor can he bear that\r\nother people should laugh at his expence. Besides, if the subject\r\nhad been properly chosen, the joke was too severe in all conscience.’\r\n‘'Sdeath! (cried the knight) I could not have bated him an ace had\r\nhe been my own father; and as for the subject, such another does not\r\npresent itself once in half a century.’ Here Mrs Tabitha interposing,\r\nand bridling up, declared, she did not see that Mr Lismahago was a\r\nfitter subject for ridicule than the knight himself; and that she was\r\nvery much afraid, he would very soon find he had mistaken his man.--The\r\nbaronet was a good deal disconcerted by his intimation, saying, that he\r\nmust be a Goth and a barbarian, if he did not enter into the spirit of\r\nsuch a happy and humourous contrivance.--He begged, however, that Mr\r\nBramble and his sister would bring him to reason; and this request was\r\nreinforced by lady Bullford, who did not fail to read the baronet a\r\nlecture upon his indiscretion, which lecture he received with submission\r\non one side of his face, and a leer upon the other.\r\n\r\nWe now went to bed for the second time; and before I got up, my uncle\r\nhad visited Lismahago in the green room, and used such arguments with\r\nhim, that when we met in the parlour he seemed to be quite appeased.\r\nHe received the knight’s apology with good grace, and even professed\r\nhimself pleased at finding he had contributed to the diversion of the\r\ncompany.--Sir Thomas shook him by the hand, laughing heartily; and\r\nthen desired a pinch of snuff, in token of perfect reconciliation--The\r\nlieutenant, putting his hand in his waistcoat pocket, pulled out,\r\ninstead of his own Scotch mull, a very fine gold snuff-box, which he no\r\nsooner perceived than he said, ‘Here is a small mistake.’ ‘No mistake\r\nat all (cried the baronet): a fair exchange is no robbery.--Oblige me so\r\nfar, captain, as to let me keep your mull as a memorial.’ ‘Sir (said the\r\nlieutenant), the mull is much at your service; but this machine I can by\r\nno means retain.--It looks like compounding a sort of felony in the code\r\nof honour. Besides, I don’t know but there may be another joke in this\r\nconveyance; and I don’t find myself disposed to be brought upon the\r\nstage again.--I won’t presume to make free with your pockets, but I beg\r\nyou will put it up again with your own hand.’ So saying, with a certain\r\nausterity of aspect, he presented the snuffbox to the knight, who\r\nreceived it in some confusion, and restored the mull, which he would by\r\nno means keep except on the terms of exchange.\r\n\r\nThis transaction was like to give a grave cast to the conversation,\r\nwhen my uncle took notice that Mr Justice Frogmore had not made his\r\nappearance either at the night-alarm, or now at the general rendezvous.\r\nThe baronet hearing Frogmore mentioned, ‘Odso! (cried he) I had forgot\r\nthe justice.--Pr’ythee, doctor, go and bring him out of his kennel.’\r\nThen laughing till his sides were well shaken, he said he would shew the\r\ncaptain, that he was not the only person of the drama exhibited for the\r\nentertainment of the company. As to the night-scene, it could not affect\r\nthe justice, who had been purposely lodged in the farther end of the\r\nhouse, remote from the noise, and lulled with a dose of opium into the\r\nbargain. In a few minutes, Mr Justice was led into the parlour in his\r\nnightcap and loose morning-gown, rolling his head from side to side, and\r\ngroaning piteously all the way.--‘Jesu! neighbour Frogmore (exclaimed\r\nthe baronet), what is the matter?--you look as if you was not a man\r\nfor this world.--Set him down softly on the couch--poor gentlemen!--Lord\r\nhave mercy upon us!--What makes him so pale, and yellow, and bloated?’\r\n‘Oh, Sir Thomas! (cried the justice) I doubt ‘tis all over with me--\r\nThose mushrooms I eat at your table have done my business--ah! oh!\r\nhey!’ ‘Now the Lord forbid! (said the other)--what! man, have a good\r\nheart--How does thy stomach feel?--hall?’\r\n\r\nTo this interrogation he made no reply; but throwing aside his\r\nnightgown, discovered that his waist-coat would not meet upon his belly\r\nby five good inches at least. ‘Heaven protect us all! (cried Sir Thomas)\r\nwhat a melancholy spectacle!--never did I see a man so suddenly swelled,\r\nbut when he was either just dead, or just dying.--Doctor, can’st thou\r\ndo nothing for this poor object?’ ‘I don’t think the case is quite\r\ndesperate (said the surgeon), but I would advise Mr Frogmore to settle\r\nhis affairs with all expedition; the parson may come and pray by him,\r\nwhile I prepare a glyster and an emetic draught.’ The justice, rolling\r\nhis languid eyes, ejaculated with great fervency, ‘Lord, have mercy upon\r\nus! Christ, have mercy upon us!’--Then he begged the surgeon, in the\r\nname of God, to dispatch--‘As for my worldly affairs (said he), they\r\nare all settled but one mortgage, which must be left to my heirs--but\r\nmy poor soul! my poor soul! what will become of my poor soul? miserable\r\nsinner that I am!’ ‘Nay, pr’ythee, my dear boy, compose thyself (resumed\r\nthe knight); consider the mercy of heaven is infinite; thou can’st\r\nnot have any sins of a very deep dye on thy conscience, or the devil’s\r\nin’t.’ ‘Name not the devil (exclaimed the terrified Frogmore), I have\r\nmore sins to answer for than the world dreams of.--Ah! friend, I have\r\nbeen sly--sly damn’d sly!--Send for the parson without loss of time, and\r\nput me to bed, for I am posting to eternity.’--He was accordingly raised\r\nfrom the couch, and supported by two servants, who led him back to his\r\nroom; but before he quitted the parlour, he intreated the good company\r\nto assist him with their prayers.--He added, ‘Take warning by me, who\r\nam suddenly cut off in my prime, like a flower of the field; and God\r\nforgive you, Sir Thomas, for suffering such poisonous trash to be eaten\r\nat your table.’\r\n\r\nHe was no sooner removed out of hearing, than the baronet abandoned\r\nhimself to a violent fit of laughing, in which he was joined by the\r\ngreatest part of the company; but we could hardly prevent the good lady\r\nfrom going to undeceive the patient, by discovering, that while he slept\r\nhis waistcoat had been straitened by the contrivance of the surgeon;\r\nand that the disorder in his stomach and bowels was occasioned by some\r\nantimonial wine, which he had taken over night, under the denomination\r\nof plague-water. She seemed to think that his apprehension might put an\r\nend to his life: the knight swore he was no such chicken, but a\r\ntough old rogue, that would live long enough to plague all his\r\nneighbours.--Upon enquiry, we found his character did not intitle him to\r\nmuch compassion or respect, and therefore we let our landlord’s humour\r\ntake its course.--A glyster was actually administered by an old woman\r\nof the family, who had been Sir Thomas’s nurse, and the patient took\r\na draught made with oxymel of squills to forward the operation of the\r\nantimonial wine, which had been retarded by the opiate of the preceding\r\nnight. He was visited by the vicar, who read prayers, and began to take\r\nan account of the state of his soul, when those medicines produced their\r\neffect; so that the parson was obliged to hold his nose while he poured\r\nforth spiritual consolation from his mouth. The same expedient was used\r\nby the knight and me, who, with the doctor, entered the chamber at this\r\njuncture, and found Frogmore enthroned on an easing-chair, under the\r\npressure of a double evacuation. The short intervals betwixt every heave\r\nhe employed in crying for mercy, confessing his sins, or asking the\r\nvicar’s opinion of his case; and the vicar answered, in a solemn\r\nsnuffling tone, that heightened the ridicule of the scene. The emetic\r\nhaving done its office, the doctor interfered, and ordered the patient\r\nto be put in bed again. When he examined the egesta, and felt his pulse,\r\nhe declared that much of the virus was discharged, and, giving him a\r\ncomposing draught, assured him he had good hopes of his recovery.--This\r\nwelcome hint he received with the tears of joy in his eyes, protesting,\r\nthat if he should recover, he would always think himself indebted for\r\nhis life to the great skill and tenderness of his doctor, whose hand he\r\nsqueezed with great fervour; and thus he was left to his repose.\r\n\r\nWe were pressed to stay dinner, that we might be witnesses of his\r\nresuscitation; but my uncle insisted upon our departing before noon,\r\nthat we might reach this town before it should be dark.--In the\r\nmean-time, lady Bullford conducted us into the garden to see a fishpond\r\njust finished, which Mr Bramble censured as being too near the parlour,\r\nwhere the knight now sat by himself, dozing in an elbow-chair after the\r\nfatigues of his morning atchievement.--In this situation he reclined,\r\nwith his feet wrapped in flannel, and supported in a line with his body,\r\nwhen the door flying open with a violent shock, lieutenant Lismahago\r\nrushed into the room with horror in his looks, exclaiming, ‘A mad dog!\r\na mad dog!’ and throwing up the window sash, leaped into the garden--Sir\r\nThomas, waked by this tremendous exclamation, started up, and forgetting\r\nhis gout, followed the lieutenant’s example by a kind of instinctive\r\nimpulse. He not only bolted thro’ the window like an arrow from a bow,\r\nbut ran up to his middle in the pond before he gave the least sign of\r\nrecollection. Then the captain began to bawl, ‘Lord have mercy upon\r\nus!--pray, take care of the gentleman!--for God’s sake, mind your\r\nfooting, my dear boy!--get warm blankets--comfort his poor carcase--warm\r\nthe bed in the green room.’\r\n\r\nLady Bullford was thunder-struck at this phaenomenon, and the rest of\r\nthe company gazed in silent astonishment, while the servants hastened\r\nto assist their master, who suffered himself to be carried back into the\r\nparlour without speaking a word.--Being instantly accommodated with dry\r\nclothes and flannels, comforted with a cordial, and replaced in statu\r\nquo, one of the maids was ordered to chafe his lower extremities, an\r\noperation in consequence of which his senses seemed to return and his\r\ngood humour to revive.--As we had followed him into the room, he looked\r\nat every individual in his turn, with a certain ludicrous expression in\r\nhis countenance, but fixed his eyes in particular upon Lismahago, who\r\npresented him with a pinch of snuff, and when he took it in silence,\r\n‘Sir Thomas Bullford (said he), I am much obliged to you for all your\r\nfavours, and some of them I have endeavoured to repay in your own coin.’\r\n‘Give me thy hand (cried the baronet); thou hast indeed payed me Scot\r\nand lot; and even left a balance in my hands, for which, in presence of\r\nthis company, I promise to be accountable.’--So saying, he laughed\r\nvery heartily, and even seemed to enjoy the retaliation which had been\r\nexacted at his own expence; but lady Bullford looked very grave; and in\r\nall probability thought the lieutenant had carried his resentment too\r\nfar, considering that her husband was valetudinary--but, according\r\nto the proverb, he that will play at bowls must expect to meet with\r\nrubbers. I have seen a tame bear, very diverting when properly managed,\r\nbecome a very dangerous wild beast when teized for the entertainment of\r\nthe spectators.--As for Lismahago, he seemed to think the fright and the\r\ncold bath would have a good effect upon his patient’s constitution: but\r\nthe doctor hinted some apprehension that the gouty matter might, by such\r\na sudden shock, be repelled from the extremities and thrown upon some of\r\nthe more vital parts of the machine.--I should be very sorry to see this\r\nprognostic verified upon our facetious landlord, who told Mrs Tabitha at\r\nparting, that he hoped she would remember him in the distribution of\r\nthe bride’s favours, as he had taken so much pains to put the captain’s\r\nparts and mettle to the proof.--After all, I am afraid our squire\r\nwill appear to be the greatest sufferer by the baronet’s wit; for his\r\nconstitution is by no means calculated for night-alarms. He has yawned\r\nand shivered all day, and gone to bed without supper; so that, as we\r\nhave got into good quarters, I imagine we shall make a halt to-morrow;\r\nin which case, you will have at least one day’s respite from the\r\npersecution of\r\n\r\nJ. MELFORD Oct. 3.\r\n\nTo Mrs MARY JONES, at Brambleton-hall.\r\n\r\nDEAR MARY JONES,\r\n\r\nMiss Liddy is so good as to unclose me in a kiver as fur as Gloster,\r\nand the carrier will bring it to hand--God send us all safe to\r\nMonmouthshire, for I’m quite jaded with rambling--‘Tis a true saying,\r\nlive and learn--0 woman, what chuckling and changing have I seen!--Well,\r\nthere’s nothing sartain in this world--Who would have thought that\r\nmistriss, after all the pains taken for the good of her prusias sole,\r\nwould go for to throw away her poor body? that she would cast the\r\nheys of infection upon such a carrying-crow as Lashmihago! as old\r\nas Mathewsullin, as dry as a red herring, and as poor as a starved\r\nveezel--0, Molly, hadst thou seen him come down the ladder, in a shurt\r\nso scanty, that it could not kiver his nakedness!--The young\r\n‘squire called him Dunquickset; but he looked for all the world like\r\nCradoc-ap-Morgan, the ould tinker, that suffered at Abergany for\r\nsteeling of kettle--Then he’s a profane scuffle, and, as Mr Clinker\r\nsays, no better than an impfiddle, continually playing upon the pyebill\r\nand the new-burth--I doubt he has as little manners as money; for he\r\ncan’t say a civil word, much more make me a present of a pair of gloves\r\nfor goodwill; but he looks as if he wanted to be very forewood and\r\nfamiliar O! that ever a gentlewoman of years and discretion should tare\r\nher air, and cry and disporridge herself for such a nubjack! as the song\r\ngoes\r\n\r\nI vow she would fain have a burd That bids such a price for an owl.\r\n\r\nbut, for sartain, he must have dealt with some Scotch musician to bring\r\nher to this pass--As for me, I put my trust in the Lord; and I have got\r\na slice of witch elm sowed in the gathers of my under petticoat; and\r\nMr Clinker assures me, that by the new light of grease, I may deify the\r\ndevil and all his works--But I nose what I nose--If mistress should take\r\nup with Lashmyhago, this is no sarvice for me--Thank God, there’s no\r\nwant of places; and if it wan’t for wan thing, I would--but, no matter\r\nMadam Baynar’s woman has twenty good pounds a-year and parquisites; and\r\ndresses like a parson of distinkson--I dined with her and the valley\r\nde shambles, with bags and golden jackets; but there was nothing\r\nkimfittable to eat, being as how they lived upon board, and having\r\nnothing but a piss of could cuddling tart and some blamangey, I was\r\ntuck with the cullick, and a murcey it was that mistress had her viol of\r\nassings in the cox.\r\n\r\nBut, as I was saying, I think for sartain this match will go forewood;\r\nfor things are come to a creesus; and I have seen with my own bays, such\r\nsmuggling--But I scorn for to exclose the secrets of the family; and\r\nif it wance comes to marrying, who nose but the frolick may go round--I\r\nbelieves as how, Miss Liddy would have no reversion if her swan would\r\nappear; and you would be surprised, Molly, to receive a bride’s fever\r\nfrom your humble sarvant--but this is all suppository, dear girl; and I\r\nhave sullenly promised to Mr Clinker, that neither man, woman, nor child\r\nshall no that arrow said a civil thing to me in the way of infection.\r\nI hope to drink your health at Brambleton-hall, in a horn of October,\r\nbefore the month be out--Pray let my bed be turned once a-day, and the\r\nwindore opened, while the weather is dry; and burn a few billets with\r\nsome brush in the footman’s garret, and see their mattrash be dry as a\r\nbone: for both our gentlemen have got a sad could by lying in damp shits\r\nat sir Tummas Ballfart’s.

JENKINS Oct. 4.\r\n\nTo Miss LAETITIA WILLIS, at Gloucester.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR LETTY,\r\n\r\nThis method of writing to you from time to time, without any hopes of an\r\nanswer, affords me, I own, some ease and satisfaction in the ‘midst of\r\nmy disquiet, as it in some degree lightens the burthen of affliction:\r\nbut it is at best a very imperfect enjoyment of friendship, because it\r\nadmits of no return of confidence and good counsel--I would give the\r\nwhole world to have your company for a single day--I am heartily\r\ntired of this itinerant way of life. I am quite dizzy with a perpetual\r\nsuccession of objects--Besides it is impossible to travel such a\r\nlength of way, without being exposed to inconveniencies, dangers, and\r\ndisagreeable accidents, which prove very grievous to a poor creature of\r\nweak nerves like me, and make me pay very dear for the gratification of\r\nmy curiosity.\r\n\r\nNature never intended me for the busy world--I long for repose and\r\nsolitude, where I can enjoy that disinterested friendship which is not\r\nto be found among crouds, and indulge those pleasing reveries that shun\r\nthe hurry and tumult of fashionable society--Unexperienced as I am in\r\nthe commerce of life, I have seen enough to give me a disgust to the\r\ngenerality of those who carry it on--There is such malice, treachery,\r\nand dissimulation, even among professed friends and intimate companions,\r\nas cannot fail to strike a virtuous mind with horror; and when Vice\r\nquits the stage for a moment, her place is immediately occupied by\r\nFolly, which is often too serious to excite any thing but compassion.\r\nPerhaps I ought to be silent on the foibles of my poor aunt; but with\r\nyou, my dear Willis, I have no secrets; and, truly, her weaknesses are\r\nsuch as cannot be concealed. Since the first moment we arrived at Bath,\r\nshe has been employed constantly in spreading nets for the other sex;\r\nand, at length, she has caught a superannuated lieutenant, who is in a\r\nfair way to make her change her name--My uncle and my brother seem to\r\nhave no objection to this extraordinary match, which, I make no doubt,\r\nwill afford abundance of matter for conversation and mirth; for my part,\r\nI am too sensible of my own weaknesses, to be diverted with those of\r\nother people--At present, I have something at heart that employs my\r\nwhole attention, and keeps my mind in the utmost terror and suspence.\r\n\r\nYesterday in the forenoon, as I stood with my brother at the parlour\r\nwindow of an inn, where we had lodged, a person passed a horseback, whom\r\n(gracious Heaven!) I instantly discovered to be Wilson! He wore a white\r\nriding-coat, with the cape buttoned up to his chin; looking remarkably\r\npale, and passed at a round trot, without seeming to observe us--Indeed,\r\nhe could not see us; for there was a blind that concealed us from the\r\nview. You may guess how I was affected at this apparition. The light\r\nforsook my eyes; and I was seized with such a palpitation and trembling,\r\nthat I could not stand. I sat down upon a couch, and strove to compose\r\nmyself, that my brother might not perceive my agitation; but it was\r\nimpossible to escape his prying eyes--He had observed the object that\r\nalarmed me; and, doubtless, knew him at the first glance--He now looked\r\nat me with a stern countenance; then he ran out into the street, to see\r\nwhat road the unfortunate horseman had taken--He afterwards dispatched\r\nhis man for further intelligence, and seemed to meditate some violent\r\ndesign. My uncle, being out of order, we remained another night at the\r\ninn; and all day long Jery acted the part of an indefatigable spy upon\r\nmy conduct--He watched my very looks with such eagerness of attention,\r\nas if he would have penetrated into the utmost recesses of my\r\nheart--This may be owing to his regard for my honour, if it is not the\r\neffect of his own pride; but he is so hot, and violent, and unrelenting,\r\nthat the sight of him alone throws me into a flutter; and really it\r\nwill not be in my power to afford him any share of my affection, if he\r\npersists in persecuting me at this rate. I am afraid he has formed some\r\nscheme of vengeance, which will make me completely wretched! I am afraid\r\nhe suspects some collusion from this appearance of Wilson.--Good God!\r\ndid he really appear? or was it only a phantom, a pale spectre to\r\napprise me of his death.\r\n\r\nO Letty, what shall I do?--where shall I turn for advice and\r\nconsolation? shall I implore the protection of my uncle, who has been\r\nalways kind and compassionate.--This must be my last resource.--I dread\r\nthe thoughts of making him uneasy; and would rather suffer a thousand\r\ndeaths than live the cause of dissension in the family.--I cannot\r\nconceive the meaning of Wilson’s coming hither:--perhaps, it was in\r\nquest of us, in order to disclose his real name and situation:--but\r\nwherefore pass without staying to make the least enquiry?--My dear\r\nWillis, I am lost in conjecture. I have not closed an eye since I saw\r\nhim.--All night long have I been tossed about from one imagination to\r\nanother. The reflection finds no resting place.--I have prayed, and\r\nsighed, and wept plentifully.--If this terrible suspence continues much\r\nlonger, I shall have another fit of illness, and then the whole family\r\nwill be in confusion--If it was consistent with the wise purposes\r\nof Providence, would I were in my grave--But it is my duty to be\r\nresigned.--My dearest Letty, excuse my weakness--excuse these blots--my\r\ntears fall so fast that I cannot keep the paper dry--yet I ought\r\nto consider that I have as yet no cause to despair but I am such a\r\nfaint-hearted timorous creature!\r\n\r\nThank God, my uncle is much better than he was yesterday. He is resolved\r\nto pursue our journey strait to Wales.--I hope we shall take Gloucester\r\nin our way--that hope chears my poor heart I shall once more embrace my\r\nbest beloved Willis, and pour all my griefs into her friendly bosom.--0\r\nheaven! is it possible that such happiness is reserved for\r\n\r\nThe dejected and forlorn LYDIA MELFORD Oct. 4.\r\n\nTo Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bart. of Jesus college, Oxon.\r\n\r\nDEAR WATKIN,\r\n\r\nI yesterday met with an incident which I believe you will own to be very\r\nsurprising--As I stood with Liddy at the window of the inn where we\r\nhad lodged, who should pass by but Wilson a-horse back!--I could not be\r\nmistaken in the person, for I had a full view of him as he advanced; I\r\nplainly perceived by my sister’s confusion that she recognized him at\r\nthe same time. I was equally astonished and incensed at his appearance,\r\nwhich I could not but interpret into an insult, or something worse. I\r\nran out at the gate, and, seeing him turn the corner of the street, I\r\ndispatched my servant to observe his motions, but the fellow was too\r\nlate to bring me that satisfaction. He told me, however, that there was\r\nan inn, called the Red Lion, at that end of the town, where he supposed\r\nthe horseman had alighted, but that he would not enquire without further\r\norders. I sent him back immediately to know what strangers were in the\r\nhouse, and he returned with a report that there was one Mr Wilson lately\r\narrived. In consequence of this information I charged him with a note\r\ndirected to that gentleman, desiring him to meet me in half an hour in\r\na certain field at the town’s end, with a case of pistols, in order\r\nto decide the difference which could not be determined at our last\r\nrencounter: but I did not think proper to subscribe the billet. My man\r\nassured me he had delivered it into his own hand; and, that having read\r\nit, he declared he would wait upon the gentleman at the place and time\r\nappointed.\r\n\r\nM’Alpine being an old soldier, and luckily sober at the time, I\r\nentrusted him with my secret. I ordered him to be within call, and,\r\nhaving given him a letter to be delivered to my uncle in case of\r\naccident, I repaired to the rendezvous, which was an inclosed field at\r\na little distance from the highway. I found my antagonist had already\r\ntaken his ground, wrapped in a dark horseman’s coat, with a laced hat\r\nflapped over his eyes; but what was my astonishment, when, throwing off\r\nthis wrapper, he appeared to be a person whom I had never seen before!\r\nHe had one pistol stuck in a leather belt, and another in his hand ready\r\nfor action, and, advancing a few steps, called to know if I was ready--I\r\nanswered, ‘No,’ and desired a parley; upon which he turned the muzzle\r\nof his piece towards the earth; then replaced it in his belt, and met me\r\nhalf way--When I assured him he was not the man I expected to meet, he\r\nsaid it might be so: that he had received a slip of paper directed to Mr\r\nWilson, requesting him to come hither; and that as there was no other in\r\nthe place of that name, he naturally concluded the note was intended\r\nfor him, and him only--I then gave him to understand, that I had been\r\ninjured by a person who assumed that name, which person I had actually\r\nseen within the hour, passing through the street on horseback; that\r\nhearing there was a Mr Wilson at the Red Lion, I took it for granted he\r\nwas the man, and in that belief had writ the billet; and I expressed my\r\nsurprize, that he, who was a stranger to me and my concerns, should give\r\nme such a rendezvous, without taking the trouble to demand a previous\r\nexplanation. He replied, that there was no other of his name in the\r\nwhole country; that no such horseman had alighted at the Red Lion since\r\nnine o’clock, when he arrived--that having had the honour to serve his\r\nmajesty, he thought he could not decently decline any invitation of\r\nthis kind, from what quarter soever it might come, and that if any\r\nexplanation was necessary, it did not belong to him to demand it, but\r\nto the gentleman who summoned him into the field. Vexed as I was at this\r\nadventure, I could not help admiring the coolness of this officer, whose\r\nopen countenance prepossessed me in his favour. He seemed to be turned\r\nof forty; wore his own short black hair, which curled naturally about\r\nhis ears, and was very plain in his apparel--When I begged pardon for\r\nthe trouble I had given him, he received my apology with great good\r\nhumour.--He told me that he lived about ten miles off, at a small\r\nfarm-house, which would afford me tolerable lodging, if I would come\r\nand take diversion of hunting with him for a few weeks; in which case we\r\nmight, perhaps, find out the man who had given me offence--I thanked him\r\nvery sincerely for his courteous offer, which, I told him, I was not at\r\nliberty to accept at present, on account of my being engaged in a\r\nfamily party; and so we parted, with mutual professions of good will and\r\nesteem.\r\n\r\nNow tell me, dear knight, what am I to make of this singular adventure?\r\nAm I to suppose that the horseman I saw was really a thing of flesh\r\nand blood, or a bubble that vanished into air?--or must I imagine Liddy\r\nknows more of the matter than she chuses to disclose?--If I thought\r\nher capable of carrying on any clandestine correspondence with such a\r\nfellow, I should at once discard all tenderness, and forget that she was\r\nconnected with me by the ties of blood--But how is it possible that\r\na girl of her simplicity and inexperience, should maintain such an\r\nintercourse, surrounded, as she is, with so many eyes, destitute of all\r\nopportunity, and shifting quarters every day of her life!--Besides, she\r\nhas solemnly promised. No--I can’t think the girl so base--so insensible\r\nto the honour of her family.--What disturbs me chiefly, is the\r\nimpression which these occurrences seem to make upon her spirits--These\r\nare the symptoms from which I conclude that the rascal has still a hold\r\non her affection, surely I have a right to call him a rascal, and to\r\nconclude that his designs are infamous. But it shall be my fault if he\r\ndoes not one day repent his presumption--I confess I cannot think, much\r\nless write on this subject, with any degree of temper or patience; I\r\nshall therefore conclude with telling you, that we hope to be in Wales\r\nby the latter end of the month: but before that period you will probably\r\nhear again from\r\n\r\nyour affectionate J. MELFORD Oct. 4.\r\n\nTo Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bart. of Jesus college, Oxon.\r\n\r\nDEAR PHILLIPS,\r\n\r\nWhen I wrote you by last post, I did not imagine I should be tempted to\r\ntrouble you again so soon: but I now sit down with a heart so full that\r\nit cannot contain itself; though I am under such agitation of spirits,\r\nthat you are to expect neither method nor connexion in this address--We\r\nhave been this day within a hair’s breadth of losing honest Matthew\r\nBramble, in consequence of a cursed accident, which I will endeavour\r\nto explain.--In crossing the country to get into the post road, it was\r\nnecessary to ford a river, and we that were a-horseback passed without\r\nany danger or difficulty; but a great quantity of rain having fallen\r\nlast night and this morning, there was such an accumulation of water,\r\nthat a mill-head gave way, just as the coach was passing under it, and\r\nthe flood rushed down with such impetuosity, as first floated, and then\r\nfairly overturned the carriage in the middle of the stream--Lismahago\r\nand I, and the two servants, alighting instantaneously, ran into the\r\nriver to give all the assistance in our power.--Our aunt, Mrs Tabitha,\r\nwho had the good fortune to be uppermost, was already half way out of\r\nthe coach window, when her lover approaching, disengaged her entirely;\r\nbut, whether his foot slipt, or the burthen was too great, they fell\r\nover head and ears in each others’ arms. He endeavoured more than once\r\nto get up, and even to disentangle himself from her embrace, but she\r\nhung about his neck like a mill-stone (no bad emblem of matrimony), and\r\nif my man had not proved a stanch auxiliary, those two lovers would in\r\nall probability have gone hand in hand to the shades below--For my part,\r\nI was too much engaged to take any cognizance of their distress.--I\r\nsnatched out my sister by the hair of the head, and, dragging her to\r\nthe bank, recollected that my uncle had, not yet appeared--Rushing again\r\ninto the stream, I met Clinker hauling ashore Mrs Jenkins, who looked\r\nlike a mermaid with her hair dishevelled about her ears; but, when I\r\nasked if his master was safe, he forthwith shook her from him, and\r\nshe must have gone to pot, if a miller had not seasonably come to her\r\nrelief.--As for Humphry, he flew like lightning, to the coach, that was\r\nby this time filled with water, and, diving into it, brought up the poor\r\n‘squire, to all appearance, deprived of life--It is not in my power to\r\ndescribe what I felt at this melancholy spectacle--it was such an agony\r\nas baffles all description! The faithful Clinker, taking him up in his\r\narms, as if he had been an infant of six months, carried him ashore,\r\nhowling most piteously all the way, and I followed him in a transport of\r\ngrief and consternation--When he was laid upon the grass and turned from\r\nside to side, a great quantity of water ran out at his mouth, then he\r\nopened his eyes, and fetched a deep sigh. Clinker perceiving these signs\r\nof life, immediately tied up his arm with a garter, and, pulling out a\r\nhorse-fleam, let him blood in the farrier stile.--At first a few drops\r\nonly issued from the orifice, but the limb being chafed, in a little\r\ntime the blood began to flow in a continued stream, and he uttered some\r\nincoherent words, which were the most welcome sounds that ever saluted\r\nmy ear. There was a country inn hard by, the landlord of which had by\r\nthis time come with his people to give their assistance.--Thither my\r\nuncle being carried, was undressed and put to bed, wrapped in warm\r\nblankets; but having been moved too soon, he fainted away, and once more\r\nlay without sense or motion, notwithstanding all the efforts of Clinker\r\nand the landlord, who bathed his temples with Hungary water, and held a\r\nsmelling-bottle to his nose. As I had heard of the efficacy of salt in\r\nsuch cases, I ordered all that was in the house to be laid under his\r\nhead and body; and whether this application had the desired effect,\r\nor nature of herself prevailed, he, in less than a quarter of an hour,\r\nbegan to breathe regularly, and soon retrieved his recollection, to the\r\nunspeakable joy of all the by-standers. As for Clinker, his brain\r\nseemed to be affected.--He laughed, and wept, and danced about in such\r\na distracted manner, that the landlord very judiciously conveyed him out\r\nof the room. My uncle, seeing me dropping wet, comprehended the whole\r\nof what had happened, and asked if all the company was safe?--Being\r\nanswered in the affirmative, he insisted upon my putting on dry clothes;\r\nand, having swallowed a little warm wine, desired he might be left to\r\nhis repose. Before I went to shift myself, I inquired about the rest\r\nof the family--I found Mrs Tabitha still delirious from her fright,\r\ndischarging very copiously the water she had swallowed. She was\r\nsupported by the captain, distilling drops from his uncurled periwig, so\r\nlank and so dank, that he looked like Father Thames without his sedges,\r\nembracing Isis, while she cascaded in his urn. Mrs Jenkins was present\r\nalso, in a loose bed gown, without either cap or handkerchief; but she\r\nseemed to be as little compos mentis as her mistress, and acted so many\r\ncross purposes in the course of her attendance, that, between the two,\r\nLismahago had occasion for all his philosophy. As for Liddy, I thought\r\nthe poor girl would have actually lost her senses. The good woman of the\r\nhouse had shifted her linen, and put her into bed; but she was seized\r\nwith the idea that her uncle had perished, and in this persuasion made a\r\ndismal out-cry; nor did she pay the least regard to what I said, when\r\nI solemnly assured her he was safe. Mr Bramble hearing the noise, and\r\nbeing informed of her apprehension, desired she might be brought into\r\nhis chamber; and she no sooner received this intimation, than she ran\r\nthither half naked, with the wildest expression of eagerness in her\r\ncountenance--Seeing the ‘squire sitting up in the bed, she sprung\r\nforwards and throwing her arms about his neck, exclaimed in a most\r\npathetic tone, ‘Are you--Are you indeed my uncle--My dear uncle!--My\r\nbest friend! My father!--Are you really living? or is it an illusion of\r\nmy poor brain!’ Honest Matthew was so much affected, that he could not\r\nhelp shedding tears, while he kissed her forehead, saying, ‘My dear\r\nLiddy, I hope I shall live long enough to shew how sensible I am of your\r\naffection--But your spirits are fluttered, child--You want rest--Go\r\nto bed and compose yourself’--‘Well, I will (she replied) but still\r\nmethinks this cannot be real--The coach was full of water--My uncle\r\nwas under us all--Gracious God!--You was under water--How did you get\r\nout;--tell me that? or I shall think this is all a deception’--‘In what\r\nmanner I was brought out, I know as little as you do, my dear (said\r\nthe ‘squire); and, truly, that is a circumstance of which I want to be\r\ninformed.’ I would have given him a detail of the whole adventure, but\r\nhe would not hear me until I should change my clothes; so that I had\r\nonly time to tell him, that he owed his life to the courage and fidelity\r\nof Clinker: and having given him this hint, I conducted my sister to her\r\nown chamber.\r\n\r\nThis accident happened about three o’clock in the afternoon, and in\r\nlittle more than an hour the hurricane was all over; but as the carriage\r\nwas found to be so much damaged, that it could not proceed without\r\nconsiderable repairs, a blacksmith and wheelwright were immediately sent\r\nfor to the next market-town, and we congratulated ourselves upon being\r\nhoused at an inn, which, though remote from the post-road, afforded\r\nexceeding good lodging. The women being pretty well composed, and the\r\nmen all a-foot, my uncle sent for his servant, and, in the presence of\r\nLismahago and me, accosted him in these words--‘So, Clinker, I find you\r\nare resolved I shan’t die by water--As you have fished me up from the\r\nbottom at your own risque, you are at least entitled to all the money\r\nthat was in my pocket, and there it is’--So saying, he presented him\r\nwith a purse containing thirty guineas, and a ring nearly of the same\r\nvalue--‘God forbid! (cried Clinker), your honour shall excuse me--I am\r\na poor fellow, but I have a heart O! if your honour did but know how\r\nI rejoice to see--Blessed be his holy name, that made me the humble\r\ninstrument--But as for the lucre of gain, I renounce it--I have done no\r\nmore than my duty--No more than I would have done for the most worthless\r\nof my fellow-creatures--No more than I would have done for captain\r\nLismahago, or Archy Macalpine, or any sinner upon earth--But for your\r\nworship, I would go through fire as well as water’--‘I do believe it,\r\nHumphry (said the ‘squire); but as you think it was your duty to save my\r\nlife at the hazard of your own, I think it is mine to express the sense\r\nI have of your extraordinary fidelity and attachment--I insist upon your\r\nreceiving this small token of my gratitude; but don’t imagine that I\r\nlook upon this as an adequate recompence for the service you have done\r\nme--I have determined to settle thirty pounds a-year upon you for life;\r\nand I desire these gentlemen will bear witness to this my intention, of\r\nwhich I have a memorandum in my pocketbook.’ ‘Lord make me thankful for\r\nall these mercies! (cried Clinker, sobbing), I have been a poor bankrupt\r\nfrom the beginning--your honour’s goodness found me, when I was--naked\r\nwhen I was--sick and forlorn--I understand your honour’s looks--I would\r\nnot give offence--but my heart is very full--and if your worship won’t\r\ngive me leave to speak,--I must vent it in prayers to heaven for my\r\nbenefactor.’ When he quitted the room, Lismahago said, he should have\r\na much better opinion of his honesty, if he did not whine and cant so\r\nabominably; but that he had always observed those weeping and praying\r\nfellows were hypocrites at bottom. Mr Bramble made no reply to this\r\nsarcastic remark, proceeding from the lieutenant’s resentment of Clinker\r\nhaving, in pure simplicity of heart, ranked him with M’Alpine and the\r\nsinners of the earth--The landlord being called to receive some orders\r\nabout the beds, told the ‘squire that his house was very much at his\r\nservice, but he was sure he should not have the honour to lodge him and\r\nhis company. He gave us to understand that his master who lived hard\r\nby, would not suffer us to be at a public house, when there was\r\naccommodation for us at his own; and that, if he had not dined abroad in\r\nthe neighbourhood he would have undoubtedly come to offer his services\r\nat our first arrival. He then launched out in praise of that gentleman,\r\nwhom he had served as butler, representing him as a perfect miracle of\r\ngoodness and generosity. He said he was a person of great learning, and\r\nallowed to be the best farmer in the country:--that he had a lady who\r\nwas as much beloved as himself, and an only son, a very hopeful young\r\ngentleman, just recovered from a dangerous fever, which had like to have\r\nproved fatal to the whole family; for, if the son had died, he was sure\r\nthe parents would not have survived their loss--He had not yet\r\nfinished the encomium of Mr Dennison, when this gentleman arrived in a\r\npost-chaise, and his appearance seemed to justify all that had been said\r\nin his favour. He is pretty well advanced in years, but hale, robust,\r\nand florid, with an ingenuous countenance, expressive of good sense and\r\nhumanity. Having condoled with us on the accident which had happened,\r\nhe said he was come to conduct us to his habitation, where we should be\r\nless incommoded than at such a paultry inn, and expressed his hope that\r\nthe ladies would not be the worse for going thither in his carriage, as\r\nthe distance was not above a quarter of a mile. My uncle having made a\r\nproper return to this courteous exhibition, eyed him attentively, and\r\nthen asked if he had not been at Oxford, a commoner of Queen’s college?\r\nWhen Mr Dennison answered, ‘Yes,’ with some marks of surprise--‘Look\r\nat me then (said our squire) and let us see if you can recollect\r\nthe features of an old friend, whom you have not seen these forty\r\nyears.’--The gentleman, taking him by the hand, and gazing at him\r\nearnestly,--‘I protest (cried he), I do think I recall the idea\r\nof Matthew Loyd of Glamorganshire, who was student of Jesus.’ ‘Well\r\nremembered, my dear friend, Charles Dennison (exclaimed my uncle,\r\npressing him to his breast), I am that very identical Matthew Loyd of\r\nGlamorgan.’ Clinker, who had just entered the room with some coals for\r\nthe fire, no sooner heard these words, than throwing down the scuttle\r\non the toes of Lismahago, he began to caper as if he was mad,\r\ncrying--‘Matthew Loyd of Glamorgan!--O Providence!--Matthew Loyd\r\nof Glamorgan!’--Then, clasping my uncle’s knees, he went on in this\r\nmanner--‘Your worship must forgive me--Matthew Loyd of Glamorgan!--O\r\nLord, Sir! I can’t contain myself!--I shall lose my senses’--‘Nay,\r\nthou hast lost them already, I believe (said the ‘squire, peevishly),\r\nprithee, Clinker, be quiet--What is the matter?’--Humphry, fumbling in\r\nhis bosom, pulled out an old wooden snuff-box, which he presented in\r\ngreat trepidation to his master, who, opening it immediately, perceived\r\na small cornelian seal, and two scraps of paper--At sight of these\r\narticles he started, and changed colour, and casting his eye upon the\r\ninscriptions--‘Ha!--how!--what! where (cried he) is the person here\r\nnamed?’ Clinker, knocking his own breast, could hardly pronounce\r\nthese words--‘Here--here--here is Matthew Loyd, as the certificate\r\nsheweth--Humphry Clinker was the name of the farrier that took me\r\n‘prentice’--‘And who gave you these tokens?’ said my uncle hastily--‘My\r\npoor mother on her death-bed’--replied the other--‘And who was your\r\nmother?’ ‘Dorothy Twyford, an please your honour, heretofore bar-keeper\r\nat the Angel at Chippenham.’--‘And why were not these tokens produced\r\nbefore?’ ‘My mother told me she had wrote to Glamorganshire, at the\r\ntime of my birth, but had no answer; and that afterwards, when she\r\nmade enquiry, there was no such person in that county.’ ‘And so in\r\nconsequence of my changing my name and going abroad at that very time,\r\nthy poor mother and thou have been left to want and misery--I am really\r\nshocked at the consequence of my own folly.’--Then, laying his hand\r\non Clinker’s head, he added, ‘Stand forth, Matthew Loyd--You see,\r\ngentlemen, how the sins of my youth rise up in judgment against me--Here\r\nis my direction written with my own hand, and a seal which I left at\r\nthe woman’s request; and this is a certificate of the child’s baptism,\r\nsigned by the curate of the parish.’ The company were not a little\r\nsurprised at this discovery, upon which Mr Dennison facetiously\r\ncongratulated both the father and the son: for my part, I shook my\r\nnew-found cousin heartily by the hand, and Lismahago complimented him\r\nwith the tears in his eyes, for he had been hopping about the room,\r\nswearing in broad Scotch, and bellowing with the pain occasioned by the\r\nfall of the coalscuttle upon his foot. He had even vowed to drive the\r\nsaul out of the body of that mad rascal: but, perceiving the unexpected\r\nturn which things had taken, he wished him joy of his good fortune,\r\nobserving that it went very near his heart, as he was like to be a great\r\ntoe out of pocket by the discovery--Mr Dennison now desired to know\r\nfor what reason my uncle had changed the name by which he knew him at\r\nOxford, and our ‘squire satisfied him, by answering to this effect--‘I\r\ntook my mother’s name, which was Loyd, as heir to her lands in\r\nGlamorganshire; but when I came of age, I sold that property, in order\r\nto clear my paternal estate, and resumed my real name; so that I am now\r\nMatthew Bramble of Brambleton-hall in Monmouthshire, at your service;\r\nand this is my nephew, Jeremy Melford of Belfield, in the county of\r\nGlamorgan.’ At that instant the ladies entering the room, he presented\r\nMrs Tabitha as his sister, and Liddy as his niece. The old gentleman\r\nsaluted them very cordially, and seemed struck with the appearance of my\r\nsister, whom he could not help surveying with a mixture of complacency\r\nand surprize--‘Sister (said my uncle), there is a poor relation that\r\nrecommends himself to your good graces--The quondam Humphry Clinker is\r\nmetamorphosed into Matthew Loyd; and claims the honour of being your\r\ncarnal kinsman--in short, the rogue proves to be a crab of my own\r\nplanting in the days of hot blood and unrestrained libertinism.’ Clinker\r\nhad by this time dropt upon one knee, by the side of Mrs Tabitha,\r\nwho, eyeing him askance, and flirting her fan with marks of agitation,\r\nthought proper, after some conflict, to hold out her hand for him to\r\nkiss, saying, with a demure aspect, ‘Brother, you have been very wicked:\r\nbut I hope you’ll live to see the folly of your ways--I am very sorry to\r\nsay the young man, whom you have this day acknowledged, has more\r\ngrace and religion, by the gift of God, than you with all your profane\r\nlearning, and repeated opportunity--I do think he has got the trick of\r\nthe eye, and the tip of the nose of my uncle Loyd of Flluydwellyn; and\r\nas for the long chin, it is the very moral of the governor’s--Brother,\r\nas you have changed his name pray change his dress also; that livery\r\ndoth not become any person that hath got our blood in his veins.’--Liddy\r\nseemed much pleased with this acquisition to the family.--She took him\r\nby the hand, declaring she should always be proud to own her connexion\r\nwith a virtuous young man, who had given so many proofs of his gratitude\r\nand affection to her uncle.--Mrs. Winifred Jenkins, extremely fluttered\r\nbetween her surprize at this discovery, and the apprehension of losing\r\nher sweet-heart, exclaimed in a giggling tone,--‘I wish you joy Mr\r\nClinker--Floyd--I would say--hi, hi, hi!--you’ll be so proud you won’t\r\nlook at your poor fellow servants, oh, oh, oh!’ Honest Clinker owned\r\nhe was overjoyed at his good fortune, which was greater than he\r\ndeserved--‘But wherefore should I be proud? (said he) a poor object\r\nconceived in sin, and brought forth in iniquity, nursed in a parish\r\nworkhouse, and bred in a smithy. Whenever I seem proud, Mrs Jenkins, I\r\nbeg of you to put me in mind of the condition I was in, when I first saw\r\nyou between Chippenham and Marlborough.’\r\n\r\nWhen this momentous affair was discussed to the satisfaction of all\r\nparties concerned, the weather being dry, the ladies declined the\r\ncarriage; so that we walked all together to Mr Dennison’s house, where\r\nwe found the tea ready prepared by his lady, an amiable matron, who\r\nreceived us with all the benevolence of hospitality. The house is old\r\nfashioned and irregular, but lodgeable and commodious. To the south it\r\nhas the river in front, at the distance of a hundred paces; and on the\r\nnorth, there is a rising ground covered with an agreeable plantation;\r\nthe greens and walks are kept in the nicest order, and all is rural and\r\nromantic. I have not yet seen the young gentleman, who is on a visit to\r\na friend in the neighbourhood, from whose house he is not expected ‘till\r\nto-morrow.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, as there is a man going to the next market town with\r\nletters for the post, I take this opportunity to send you the history of\r\nthis day, which has been remarkably full of adventures; and you will\r\nown I give you them like a beef-steak at Dolly’s, hot and hot, without\r\nceremony and parade, just as they come from the recollection of\r\n\r\nYours, J. MELFORD\r\n\nTo Dr LEWIS.\r\n\r\nDEAR DICK,\r\n\r\nSince the last trouble I gave you, I have met with a variety of\r\nincidents, some of them of a singular nature, which I reserve as a fund\r\nfor conversation; but there are others so interesting, that they will\r\nnot keep in petto till meeting.\r\n\r\nKnow then, it was a thousand pounds to a sixpence, that you should now\r\nbe executing my will, instead of perusing my letter! Two days ago, our\r\ncoach was overturned in the midst of a rapid river, where my life was\r\nsaved with the utmost difficulty, by the courage, activity, and\r\npresence of mind of my servant Humphry Clinker--But this is not the\r\nmost surprising circumstance of the adventure--The said Humphry Clinker\r\nproves to be Matthew Loyd, natural son of one Matthew Loyd of Glamorgan,\r\nif you know any such person--You see, Doctor, that notwithstanding all\r\nyour philosophy, it is not without some reason that the Welchmen ascribe\r\nsuch energy to the force of blood--But we shall discuss this point on\r\nsome future occasion.\r\n\r\nThis is not the only discovery which I made in consequence of our\r\ndisaster--We happened to be wrecked upon a friendly shore--The lord\r\nof the manor is no other than Charles Dennison, our fellow-rake at\r\nOxford--We are now happily housed with that gentleman, who has really\r\nattained to that pitch of rural felicity, at which I have been aspiring\r\nthese twenty years in vain. He is blessed with a consort, whose\r\ndisposition is suited to his own in all respects; tender, generous, and\r\nbenevolent--She, moreover, possesses an uncommon share of understanding,\r\nfortitude, and discretion, and is admirably qualified to be his\r\ncompanion, confidant, counsellor, and coadjutrix. These excellent\r\npersons have an only son, about nineteen years of age, just such a\r\nyouth as they could have wished that Heaven would bestow to fill up the\r\nmeasure of their enjoyment--In a word, they know no other allay to\r\ntheir happiness, but their apprehension and anxiety about the life and\r\nconcerns of this beloved object.\r\n\r\nOur old friend, who had the misfortune to be a second brother, was bred\r\nto the law, and even called to the bar; but he did not find himself\r\nqualified to shine in that province, and had very little inclination for\r\nhis profession--He disobliged his father, by marrying for love, without\r\nany consideration of fortune; so that he had little or nothing to\r\ndepend upon for some years but his practice, which afforded him a bare\r\nsubsistence; and the prospect of an increasing family, began to give\r\nhim disturbance and disquiet. In the mean time, his father dying, was\r\nsucceeded by his elder brother, a fox-hunter and a sot, who neglected\r\nhis affairs, insulted and oppressed his servants, and in a few years had\r\nwell nigh ruined the estate, when he was happily carried off by a fever,\r\nthe immediate consequence of a debauch. Charles, with the approbation of\r\nhis wife, immediately determined to quit business, and retire into the\r\ncountry, although this resolution was strenuously and zealously opposed\r\nby every individual, whom he consulted on the subject. Those who had\r\ntried the experiment, assured him that he could not pretend to breathe\r\nin the country for less than the double of what his estate produced;\r\nthat, in order to be upon the footing of a gentleman, he would be\r\nobliged to keep horses, hounds, carriages, with a suitable number of\r\nservants, and maintain an elegant table for the entertainment of his\r\nneighbours; that farming was a mystery, known only to those who had been\r\nbred up to it from the cradle, the success of it depending not only\r\nupon skill and industry, but also upon such attention and oeconomy as\r\nno gentleman could be supposed to give or practise; accordingly, every\r\nattempt made by gentlemen miscarried, and not a few had been ruined by\r\ntheir prosecution of agriculture--Nay, they affirmed that he would find\r\nit cheaper to buy hay and oats for his cattle, and to go to market\r\nfor poultry, eggs, kitchen herbs, and roots, and every the most\r\ninconsiderable article of house-keeping, than to have those articles\r\nproduced on his own ground.\r\n\r\nThese objections did not deter Mr Dennison, because they were chiefly\r\nfounded on the supposition, that he would be obliged to lead a life of\r\nextravagance and dissipation, which he and his consort equally detested,\r\ndespised, and determined to avoid--The objects he had in view, were\r\nhealth of body, peace of mind, and the private satisfaction of domestic\r\nquiet, unallayed by actual want, and uninterrupted by the fears of\r\nindigence--He was very moderate in his estimate of the necessaries, and\r\neven of the comforts of life--He required nothing but wholesome air,\r\npure water, agreeable exercise, plain diet, convenient lodging, and\r\ndecent apparel. He reflected, that if a peasant without education, or\r\nany great share of natural sagacity, could maintain a large family, and\r\neven become opulent upon a farm, for which he payed an annual rent of\r\ntwo or three hundred pounds to the landlord, surely he himself might\r\nhope for some success from his industry, having no rent to pay, but,\r\non the contrary, three or four hundred pounds a year to receive. He\r\nconsidered, that the earth was an indulgent mother, that yielded her\r\nfruits to all her children without distinction. He had studied the\r\ntheory of agriculture with a degree of eagerness and delight; and he\r\ncould not conceive there was any mystery in the practice, but what he\r\nshould be able to disclose by dint of care and application. With respect\r\nto houshold expence, he entered into a minute detail and investigation,\r\nby which he perceived the assertions of his friends were altogether\r\nerroneous--He found he should save sixty pounds a year in the\r\nsingle article of house-rent, and as much more in pocket-money and\r\ncontingencies; that even butcher’s-meat was twenty per cent cheaper in\r\nthe country than in London; but that poultry, and almost every other\r\ncircumstance of house-keeping, might be had for less than one-half of\r\nwhat they cost in town; besides, a considerable saving on the side of\r\ndress, in being delivered from the oppressive imposition of ridiculous\r\nmodes, invented by ignorance, and adopted by folly.\r\n\r\nAs to the danger of vying with the rich in pomp and equipage, it never\r\ngave him the least disturbance. He was now turned of forty, and, having\r\nlived half that time in the busy scenes of life, was well skilled in the\r\nscience of mankind. There cannot be in nature a more contemptible figure\r\nthan that of a man, who, with five hundred a year, presumes to rival\r\nin expence a neighbour who possesses five times that income--His\r\nostentation, far from concealing, serves only to discover his indigence,\r\nand render his vanity the more shocking; for it attracts the eyes of\r\ncensure, and excites the spirit of inquiry. There is not a family in the\r\ncounty nor a servant in his own house, nor a farmer in the parish, but\r\nwhat knows the utmost farthing that his lands produce, and all\r\nthese behold him with scorn or compassion. I am surprised that these\r\nreflections do not occur to persons in this unhappy dilemma, and produce\r\na salutary effect; but the truth is, of all the passions incident\r\nto human nature, vanity is that which most effectually perverts the\r\nfaculties of the understanding; nay, it sometimes becomes so incredibly\r\ndepraved, as to aspire at infamy, and find pleasure in bearing the\r\nstigmas of reproach.\r\n\r\nI have now given you a sketch of the character and situation of Mr\r\nDennison, when he came down to take possession of this estate; but as\r\nthe messenger, who carries the letters to the next town, is just setting\r\noff, I shall reserve what further I have to say on this subject, till\r\nthe next post, when you shall certainly hear from\r\n\nYours always, MATT. BRAMBLE Oct. 8.\r\n\nTo Dr LEWIS.\r\n\r\nOnce more, dear doctor, I resume the pen for your amusement. It was\r\non the morning after our arrival that, walking out with my friend, Mr\r\nDennison, I could not help breaking forth into the warmest expressions\r\nof applause at the beauty of the scene, which is really inchanting; and\r\nI signified, in particular, how much I was pleased with the disposition\r\nof some detached groves, that afforded at once shelter and ornament to\r\nhis habitation.\r\n\r\n‘When I took possession of these lands, about two and twenty years ago\r\n(said he), there was not a tree standing within a mile of the house,\r\nexcept those of an old neglected orchard, which produced nothing\r\nbut leaves and moss.--It was in the gloomy month of November, when I\r\narrived, and found the house in such a condition, that it might have\r\nbeen justly stiled the tower of desolation.--The court-yard was covered\r\nwith nettles and docks, and the garden exhibited such a rank plantation\r\nof weeds as I had never seen before;--the window-shutters were falling\r\nin pieces,--the sashes broken;--and owls and jack-daws had taken\r\npossession of the chimnies.--The prospect within was still more\r\ndreary--All was dark, and damp, and dirty beyond description;--the rain\r\npenetrated in several parts of the roof;--in some apartments the very\r\nfloors had given way;--the hangings were parted from the walls, and\r\nshaking in mouldy remnants; the glasses were dropping out of their\r\nframes;--the family-pictures were covered with dust and all the chairs\r\nand tables worm-eaten and crazy.--There was not a bed in the house that\r\ncould be used, except one old-fashioned machine, with a high gilt tester\r\nand fringed curtains of yellow mohair, which had been, for aught I know,\r\ntwo centuries in the family.--In short, there was no furniture but the\r\nutensils of the kitchen; and the cellar afforded nothing but a few empty\r\nbutts and barrels, that stunk so abominably, that I would not suffer\r\nany body to enter it until I had flashed a considerable quantity of\r\ngunpowder to qualify the foul air within.\r\n\r\n‘An old cottager and his wife, who were hired to lie in the house, had\r\nleft it with precipitation, alledging, among other causes of retreat,\r\nthat they could not sleep for frightful noises, and that my poor\r\nbrother certainly walked after his death.--In a word, the house appeared\r\nuninhabitable; the barn, stable, and outhouses were in ruins; all the\r\nfences broken down, and the fields lying waste.\r\n\r\n‘The farmer who kept the key never dreamed I had any intention to live\r\nupon the spot--He rented a farm of sixty pounds, and his lease was just\r\nexpiring.--He had formed a scheme of being appointed bailiff to the\r\nestate, and of converting the house and the adjacent grounds to his own\r\nuse.--A hint of his intention I received from the curate at my first\r\narrival; I therefore did not pay much regard to what he said by way of\r\ndiscouraging me from coming to settle in the country; but I was a little\r\nstartled when he gave me warning that he should quit the farm at the\r\nexpiration of his lease, unless I could abate considerably in the rent.\r\n\r\n‘At this period I accidentally became acquainted with a person, whose\r\nfriendship laid the foundation of all my prosperity. In the next\r\nmarket-town I chanced to dine at an inn with a Mr Wilson, who was lately\r\ncome to settle in the neighbourhood.--He had been lieutenant of a man of\r\nwar, but quitted the sea in some disgust, and married the only daughter\r\nof farmer Bland, who lives in this parish, and has acquired a good\r\nfortune in the way of husbandry.--Wilson is one of the best natured\r\nmen I ever knew; brave, frank, obliging, and ingenuous--He liked my\r\nconversation, I was charmed with his liberal manner; and acquaintance\r\nimmediately commenced, and this was soon improved into a friendship\r\nwithout reserve.--There are characters which, like similar particles of\r\nmatter, strongly attract each other.--He forthwith introduced me to his\r\nfather-in-law, farmer Bland, who was well acquainted with every acre\r\nof my estate, of consequence well qualified to advise me on this\r\noccasion.--Finding I was inclined to embrace a country life, and even\r\nto amuse myself with the occupation of farming, he approved of my\r\ndesign--He gave me to understand that all my farms were underlett; that\r\nthe estate was capable of great improvement; that there was plenty of\r\nchalk in the neighbourhood; and that my own ground produced excellent\r\nmarle for manure.--With respect to the farm, which was like to fall into\r\nmy hands, he said he would willingly take it at the present rent; but\r\nat the same time owned, that if I would expend two hundred pounds in\r\nenclosure, it would be worth more than double the sum.\r\n\r\n‘Thus encouraged, I began the execution of my scheme without further\r\ndelay, and plunged into a sea of expence, though I had no fund in\r\nreserve, and the whole produce of the estate did not exceed three\r\nhundred pounds a year--In one week, my house was made weather-tight, and\r\nthoroughly cleansed from top to bottom; then it was well ventilated by\r\nthrowing all the doors and windows open, and making blazing fires of\r\nwood in every chimney from the kitchen to the garrets. The floors were\r\nrepaired, the sashes new glazed, and out of the old furniture of the\r\nwhole house, I made shift to fit up a parlour and three chambers in\r\na plain yet decent manner.--The court-yard was cleared of weeds and\r\nrubbish, and my friend Wilson charged himself with the dressing of\r\nthe garden; bricklayers were set at work upon the barn and stable; and\r\nlabourers engaged to restore the fences, and begin the work of\r\nhedging and ditching, under the direction of farmer Bland, at whose\r\nrecommendation I hired a careful hind to lie in the house, and keep\r\nconstant fires in the apartments.\r\n\r\n‘Having taken these measures, I returned to London, where I forthwith\r\nsold off my household-furniture, and, in three weeks from my first\r\nvisit, brought my wife hither to keep her Christmas.--Considering the\r\ngloomy season of the year, the dreariness of the place, and the decayed\r\naspect of our habitation, I was afraid that her resolution would sink\r\nunder the sudden transition from a town life to such a melancholy state\r\nof rustication; but I was agreeably disappointed.--She found the reality\r\nless uncomfortable than the picture I had drawn.--By this time indeed,\r\nthings were mended in appearance--The out-houses had risen out of their\r\nruins; the pigeon-house was rebuilt, and replenished by Wilson, who also\r\nput my garden in decent order, and provided a good stock of poultry,\r\nwhich made an agreeable figure in my yard; and the house, on the whole,\r\nlooked like the habitation of human creatures.--Farmer Bland spared me a\r\nmilch cow for my family, and an ordinary saddle-horse for my servant to\r\ngo to market at the next town.--I hired a country lad for a footman, the\r\nhind’s daughter was my house-maid, and my wife had brought a cook-maid\r\nfrom London.\r\n\r\n‘Such was my family when I began house-keeping in this place, with three\r\nhundred pounds in my pocket, raised from the sale of my superfluous\r\nfurniture.--I knew we should find occupation enough through the day to\r\nemploy our time; but I dreaded the long winter evenings; yet, for those\r\ntoo we found a remedy: The curate, who was a single man, soon became so\r\nnaturalized to the family, that he generally lay in the house; and his\r\ncompany was equally agreeable and useful. He was a modest man, a good\r\nscholar, and perfectly well qualified to instruct me in such country\r\nmatters as I wanted to know.--Mr Wilson brought his wife to see us, and\r\nshe became so fond of Mrs Dennison, that she said she was never so happy\r\nas when she enjoyed the benefit of her conversation.--She was then a\r\nfine buxom country lass, exceedingly docile, and as good-natured as her\r\nhusband Jack Wilson; so that a friendship ensued among the women, which\r\nhath continued to this day.\r\n\r\n‘As for Jack, he hath been my constant companion, counsellor, and\r\ncommissary.--I would not for a hundred pounds you should leave my house\r\nwithout seeing him.--Jack is an universal genius--his talents are really\r\nastonishing:--He is an excellent carpenter, joiner, and turner, and\r\na cunning artist in iron and brass.--He not only superintended my\r\noeconomy, but also presided over my pastimes--He taught me to brew\r\nbeer, to make cyder, perry, mead, usquebaugh, and plague-water; to cook\r\nseveral outlandish delicacies, such as ollas, pepper-pots, pillaws,\r\ncorys, chabobs, and stufatas.--He understands all manner of games from\r\nchess down to chuck-farthing, sings a good song, plays upon the violin,\r\nand dances a hornpipe with surprising agility.--He and I walked, and\r\nrode, and hunted, and fished together, without minding the vicissitudes\r\nof the weather; and I am persuaded, that in a raw, moist climate, like\r\nthis of England, continual exercise is as necessary as food to the\r\npreservation of the individual.--In the course of two and twenty\r\nyears, there has not been one hour’s interruption or abatement in the\r\nfriendship subsisting between Wilson’s family and mine; and, what is\r\na rare instance of good fortune, that friendship is continued to our\r\nchildren.--His son and mine are nearly of the same age and the same\r\ndisposition; they have been bred up together at the same school and\r\ncollege, and love each other with the warmest affection.\r\n\r\n‘By Wilson’s means, I likewise formed an acquaintance with a sensible\r\nphysician, who lives in the next market-town; and his sister, an\r\nagreeable old maiden, passed the Christmas holidays at our house. Mean\r\nwhile I began my farming with great eagerness, and that very winter\r\nplanted these groves that please you so much.--As for the neighbouring\r\ngentry, I had no trouble from that quarter during my first campaign;\r\nthey were all gone to town before I settled in the country; and by the\r\nsummer I had taken measures to defend myself from their attacks.--When a\r\ngay equipage came to my gates, I was never at home; those who visited\r\nme in a modest way, I received; and according to the remarks I made on\r\ntheir characters and conversation, either rejected their advances, or\r\nreturned their civility--I was in general despised among the fashionable\r\ncompany, as a low fellow, both in breeding and circumstances;\r\nnevertheless, I found a few individuals of moderate fortune, who gladly\r\nadopted my stile of living; and many others would have acceded to our\r\nsociety, had they not been prevented by the pride, envy, and ambition of\r\ntheir wives and daughters.--Those, in times of luxury and dissipation,\r\nare the rocks upon which all the small estates in the country are\r\nwrecked.\r\n\r\n‘I reserved in my own hands, some acres of ground adjacent to the house,\r\nfor making experiments in agriculture, according to the directions of\r\nLyle, Tull, Hart, Duhamel, and others who have written on this subject;\r\nand qualified their theory with the practical observations of farmer\r\nBland, who was my great master in the art of husbandry.--In short, I\r\nbecame enamoured of a country life; and my success greatly exceeded my\r\nexpectation--I drained bogs, burned heath, grubbed up furze and fern;\r\nI planted copse and willows where nothing else would grow; I gradually\r\ninclosed all my farms, and made such improvements that my estate now\r\nyields me clear twelve hundred pounds a year--All this time my wife\r\nand I have enjoyed uninterrupted health, and a regular flow of spirits,\r\nexcept on a very few occasions, when our cheerfulness was invaded by\r\nsuch accidents as are inseparable from the condition of life. I lost\r\ntwo children in their infancy, by the small-pox, so that I have one son\r\nonly, in whom all our hopes are centered.--He went yesterday to visit\r\na friend, with whom he has stayed all night, but he will be here to\r\ndinner.--I shall this day have the pleasure of presenting him to you\r\nand your family; and I flatter myself you will find him not altogether\r\nunworthy of our affection.\r\n\r\n‘The truth is, either I am blinded by the partiality of a parent, or\r\nhe is a boy of very amiable character; and yet his conduct has given us\r\nunspeakable disquiet.--You must know, we had projected a match between\r\nhim and a gentleman’s daughter in the next county, who will in all\r\nprobability be heiress of a considerable fortune; but, it seems, he had\r\na personal disgust to the alliance. He was then at Cambridge, and tried\r\nto gain time on various pretences; but being pressed in letters by his\r\nmother and me to give a definitive answer, he fairly gave his tutor the\r\nslip, and disappeared about eight months ago.--Before he took this rash\r\nstep, he wrote me a letter, explaining his objections to the match,\r\nand declaring, that he would keep himself concealed until he should\r\nunderstand that his parents would dispense with his contracting an\r\nengagement that must make him miserable for life, and he prescribed\r\nthe form of advertising in a certain newspaper, by which he might be\r\napprized of our sentiments on this subject.\r\n\r\n‘You may easily conceive how much we were alarmed and afflicted by this\r\nelopement, which he had made without dropping the least hint to his\r\ncompanion Charles Wilson, who belonged to the same college.--We resolved\r\nto punish him with the appearance of neglect, in hopes that he would\r\nreturn of his own accord; but he maintained his purpose till the young\r\nlady chose a partner for herself; then he produced himself, and made his\r\npeace by the mediation of Wilson.--Suppose we should unite our families\r\nby joining him with your niece, who is one of the most lovely creatures\r\nI ever beheld.--My wife is already as fond of her as if she were her own\r\nchild, and I have a presentiment that my son will be captivated by her\r\nat first sight.’ ‘Nothing could be more agreeable to all our family\r\n(said I) than such an alliance; but, my dear friend, candour obliges\r\nme to tell you, that I am afraid Liddy’s heart is not wholly\r\ndisengaged--there is a cursed obstacle’--‘You mean the young stroller\r\nat Gloucester (said he)--You are surprised that I should know this\r\ncircumstance; but you will be more surprised when I tell you that\r\nstroller is no other than my son George Dennison--That was the character\r\nhe assumed in his eclipse.’ ‘I am, indeed, astonished and overjoyed\r\n(cried I), and shall be happy beyond expression to see your proposal\r\ntake effect.’\r\n\r\nHe then gave me to understand that the young gentleman, at his emerging\r\nfrom concealment, had disclosed his passion for Miss Melford, the niece\r\nof Mr Bramble, of Monmouthshire. Though Mr Dennison little dreamed that\r\nthis was his old friend Matthew Loyd, he nevertheless furnished his son\r\nwith proper credentials, and he had been at Bath, London, and many other\r\nplaces in quest of us, to make himself and his pretensions known.\r\n\r\nThe bad success of his enquiry had such an effect upon his spirits, that\r\nimmediately at his return he was seized with a dangerous fever, which\r\noverwhelmed his parents with terror and affliction; but he was now\r\nhappily recovered, though still weak and disconsolate. My nephew joining\r\nus in our walk, I informed him of these circumstances, with which he\r\nwas wonderfully pleased. He declared he would promote the match to the\r\nutmost of his power, and that he longed to embrace young Mr Dennison as\r\nhis friend and brother.--Mean while, the father went to desire his wife\r\nto communicate this discovery gradually to Liddy, that her delicate\r\nnerves might not suffer too sudden a shock; and I imparted the\r\nparticulars to my sister Tabby, who expressed some surprize, not\r\naltogether unmixed, I believe, with an emotion of envy; for, though\r\nshe could have no objection to an alliance at once so honourable and\r\nadvantageous, she hesitated in giving her consent on pretence of\r\nthe youth and inexperience of the parties: at length, however, she\r\nacquiesced, in consequence of having consulted with captain Lismahago.\r\n\r\nMr Dennison took care to be in the way when his son arrived at the gate,\r\nand, without giving him time or opportunity to make any enquiry about\r\nthe strangers, brought him up stairs to be presented to Mr Loyd and his\r\nfamily--The first person he saw when he entered the room, was Liddy,\r\nwho, notwithstanding all her preparation, stood trembling in the utmost\r\nconfusion--At sight of this object he was fixed motionless to the floor,\r\nand, gazing at her with the utmost eagerness of astonishment, exclaimed,\r\n‘Sacred heaven! what is this!--ha! wherefore--’ Here his speech failing,\r\nhe stood straining his eyes, in the most emphatic silence ‘George (said\r\nhis father), this is my friend Mr Loyd.’ Roused at this intimation, he\r\nturned and received my salute, when I said, ‘Young gentleman, if you had\r\ntrusted me with your secret at our last meeting, we should have parted\r\nupon better terms.’ Before he could make any answer, Jery came round\r\nand stood before him with open arms.--At first, he started and changed\r\ncolour; but after a short pause, he rushed into his embrace, and they\r\nhugged one another as if they had been intimate friends from their\r\ninfancy: then he payed his respects to Mrs Tabitha, and advancing to\r\nLiddy, ‘Is it possible, (cried he), that my senses do not play me false!\r\nthat I see Miss Melford under my father’s roof--that I am permitted\r\nto speak to her without giving offence--and that her relations have\r\nhonoured me with their countenance and protection.’ Liddy blushed,\r\nand trembled, and faltered--‘To be sure, sir (said she), it is a very\r\nsurprising circumstance--a great--a providential--I really know not what\r\nI say--but I beg you will think I have said what’s agreeable.’\r\n\r\nMrs Dennison interposing said, ‘Compose yourselves, my dear\r\nchildren.--Your mutual happiness shall be our peculiar care.’ The son\r\ngoing up to his mother, kissed one hand; my niece bathed the other with\r\nher tears; and the good old lady pressed them both in their turns to\r\nher breast.--The lovers were too much affected to get rid of their\r\nembarrassment for one day; but the scene was much enlivened by the\r\narrival of Jack Wilson, who brought, as usual, some game of his own\r\nkilling--His honest countenance was a good letter of recommendation. I\r\nreceived him like a dear friend after a long separation; and I could\r\nnot help wondering to see him shake Jery by the hand as an old\r\nacquaintance--They had, indeed, been acquainted some days, in\r\nconsequence of a diverting incident, which I shall explain at meeting.\r\nThat same night a consultation was held upon the concerns of the lovers,\r\nwhen the match was formally agreed to, and all the marriage articles\r\nwere settled without the least dispute.--My nephew and I promised to\r\nmake Liddy’s fortune five thousand pounds. Mr Dennison declared, he\r\nwould make over one half of his estate immediately to his son, and\r\nthat his daughter-in-law should be secured in a jointure of four\r\nhundred--Tabby proposed, that, considering their youth, they should\r\nundergo one year at least, of probation before the indissoluble knot\r\nshould be tied; but the young gentleman being very impatient and\r\nimportunate, and the scheme implying that the young couple should live\r\nin the house, under the wings of his parents, we resolved to make them\r\nhappy without further delay.\r\n\r\nAs the law requires that the parties should be some weeks resident\r\nin the parish, we shall stay here till the ceremony is performed.--Mr\r\nLismahago requests that he may take the benefit of the same occasion; so\r\nthat next Sunday the banns will be published for all four together.--I\r\ndoubt I shall not be able to pass my Christmas with you at\r\nBrambleton-hall.--Indeed, I am so agreeably situated in this place, that\r\nI have no desire to shift my quarters; and I foresee, that when the day\r\nof separation comes, there will be abundance of sorrow on all sides.--In\r\nthe mean time, we must make the most of those blessings which Heaven\r\nbestows.--Considering how you are tethered by your profession, I cannot\r\nhope to see you so far from home; yet the distance does not exceed a\r\nsummer-day’s journey, and Charles Dennison, who desires to be remembered\r\nto you, would be rejoiced to see his old compotator; but as I am now\r\nstationary, I expect regular answers to the epistles of\r\n\r\nYours invariably, MATT. BRAMBLE Oct. 11.\r\n\nTo Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bart. at Oxon.\r\n\r\nDEAR WAT,\r\n\r\nEvery day is now big with incident and discovery--Young Mr Dennison\r\nproves to be no other than that identical person whom I have execrated\r\nso long, under the name of Wilson--He had eloped from college at\r\nCambridge, to avoid a match that he detested, and acted in different\r\nparts of the country as a stroller, until the lady in question made\r\nchoice of a husband for herself; then he returned to his father, and\r\ndisclosed his passion for Liddy, which met with the approbation of his\r\nparents, though the father little imagined that Mr Bramble was his old\r\ncompanion Matthew Loyd. The young gentleman, being impowered to make\r\nhonourable proposals to my uncle and me, had been in search of us all\r\nover England, without effect; and he it was whom I had seen pass on\r\nhorseback by the window of the inn, where I stood with my sister, but\r\nhe little dreamed that we were in the house--As for the real Mr Wilson,\r\nwhom I called forth to combat, by mistake, he is the neighbour and\r\nintimate friend of old Mr Dennison, and this connexion had suggested to\r\nthe son the idea of taking that name while he remained in obscurity.\r\n\r\nYou may easily conceive what pleasure I must have felt on discovering\r\nthat the honour of our family was in no danger from the conduct of a\r\nsister whom I love with uncommon affection; that, instead of debasing\r\nher sentiments and views to a wretched stroller, she had really\r\ncaptivated the heart of a gentleman, her equal in rank and superior in\r\nfortune; and that, as his parents approved of his attachment, I was on\r\nthe eve of acquiring a brother-in-law so worthy of my friendship and\r\nesteem. George Dennison is, without all question, one of the most\r\naccomplished young fellows in England. His person is at once elegant\r\nand manly, and his understanding highly cultivated. Tho’ his spirit\r\nis lofty, his heart is kind; and his manner so engaging, as to command\r\nveneration and love, even from malice and indifference. When I weigh\r\nmy own character with his, I am ashamed to find myself so light in the\r\nbalance; but the comparison excites no envy--I propose him as a model\r\nfor imitation--I have endeavoured to recommend myself to his friendship,\r\nand hope I have already found a place in his affection. I am, however,\r\nmortified to reflect what flagrant injustice we every day commit, and\r\nwhat absurd judgment we form, in viewing objects through the falsifying\r\nmediums of prejudice and passion. Had you asked me a few days ago, the\r\npicture of Wilson the player, I should have drawn a portrait very unlike\r\nthe real person and character of George Dennison. Without all doubt, the\r\ngreatest advantage acquired in travelling and perusing mankind in the\r\noriginal, is that of dispelling those shameful clouds that darken the\r\nfaculties of the mind, preventing it from judging with candour and\r\nprecision.\r\n\r\nThe real Wilson is a great original, and the best tempered,\r\ncompanionable man I ever knew--I question if ever he was angry or\r\nlow-spirited in his life. He makes no pretensions to letters; but he is\r\nan adept in every thing else that can be either useful or entertaining.\r\nAmong other qualifications, he is a complete sportsman, and counted the\r\nbest shot in the county. He and Dennison, and Lismahago and I, attended\r\nby Clinker, went a-shooting yesterday, and made a great havock among the\r\npartridges--To-morrow we shall take the field against the woodcocks and\r\nsnipes. In the evening we dance and sing, or play at commerce, loo, and\r\nquadrille.\r\n\r\nMr Dennison is an elegant poet, and has written some detached pieces on\r\nthe subject of his passion for Liddy, which must be very flattering\r\nto the vanity of a young woman--Perhaps he is one of the greatest\r\ntheatrical geniuses that ever appeared. He sometimes entertains us with\r\nreciting favourite speeches from our best plays. We are resolved to\r\nconvert the great hall into a theatre, and get up the Beaux Stratagem\r\nwithout delay--I think I shall make no contemptible figure in the\r\ncharacter of Scrub; and Lismahago will be very great in Captain Gibbet.\r\nWilson undertakes to entertain the country people with Harlequin\r\nSkeleton, for which he has got a jacket ready painted with his own hand.\r\n\r\nOur society is really enchanting. Even the severity of Lismahago\r\nrelaxes, and the vinegar of Mrs Tabby is remarkably dulcified, ever\r\nsince it was agreed that she should take precedency of her niece in\r\nbeing first noosed: for, you must know, the day is fixed for Liddy’s\r\nmarriage; and the banns for both couples have been already once\r\npublished in the parish church. The Captain earnestly begged that\r\none trouble might serve for all, and Tabitha assented with a vile\r\naffectation of reluctance. Her inamorato, who came hither very slenderly\r\nequipt, has sent for his baggage to London, which, in all probability,\r\nwill not arrive in time for the wedding; but it is of no great\r\nconsequence, as every thing is to be transacted with the utmost\r\nprivacy--Meanwhile, directions are given for making out the contracts\r\nof marriage, which are very favourable for both females; Liddy will be\r\nsecured in a good jointure; and her aunt will remain mistress of her own\r\nfortune, except one half of the interest, which her husband shall have\r\na right to enjoy for his natural life: I think this is as little in\r\nconscience as can be done for a man who yokes with such a partner for\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThese expectants seem to be so happy, that if Mr Dennison had an\r\nagreeable daughter, I believe I should be for making the third couple\r\nin this country dance. The humour seems to be infectious; for Clinker,\r\nalias Loyd, has a month’s mind to play the fool, in the same fashion,\r\nwith Mrs Winifred Jenkins. He has even sounded me on the subject; but I\r\nhave given him no encouragement to prosecute this scheme--I told him\r\nI thought he might do better, as there was no engagement nor promise\r\nsubsisting; that I did not know what designs my uncle might have formed\r\nfor his advantage; but I was of opinion, that he should not, at present,\r\nrun the risque of disobliging him by any premature application of this\r\nnature--Honest Humphry protested he would suffer death sooner than do or\r\nsay any thing that should give offence to the ‘squire: but he owned he\r\nhad a kindness for the young woman, and had reason to think she\r\nlooked upon him with a favourable eye; that he considered this mutual\r\nmanifestation of good will, as an engagement understood, which ought to\r\nbe binding to the conscience of an honest man; and he hoped the ‘squire\r\nand I would be of the same opinion, when we should be at leisure to\r\nbestow any thought about the matter--I believe he is in the right; and\r\nwe shall find time to take his case into consideration--You see we are\r\nfixed for some weeks at least, and as you have had a long respite, I\r\nhope you will begin immediately to discharge the arrears due to\r\n\r\nYour affectionate, J. MELFORD Oct. 14.\r\n\nTo Miss LAETITIA WILLIS, at Gloucester.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR, DEAR LETTY,\r\n\r\nNever did I sit down to write in such agitation as I now feel--In\r\nthe course of a few days, we have met with a number of incidents so\r\nwonderful and interesting, that all my ideas are thrown into confusion\r\nand perplexity--You must not expect either method or coherence in what\r\nI am going to relate--my dearest Willis. Since my last, the aspect of\r\naffairs is totally changed!--and so changed! but I would fain give you\r\na regular detail--In passing a river about eight days ago, our coach was\r\noverturned, and some of us narrowly escaped with life--My uncle had well\r\nnigh perished. O Heaven, I cannot reflect upon that circumstance without\r\nhorror--I should have lost my best friend, my father and protector, but\r\nfor the resolution and activity of his servant Humphry Clinker, whom\r\nProvidence really seems to have placed near him for the necessity of\r\nthis occasion.--I would not be thought superstitious; but surely he\r\nacted from a stronger impulse than common fidelity. Was it not the\r\nvoice of nature that loudly called upon him to save the life of his\r\nown father? for, 0 Letty, it was discovered that Humphry Clinker was my\r\nuncle’s natural son.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same instant, a gentleman, who came to offer us his\r\nassistance, and invite us to his house, turned out to be a very old\r\nfriend of Mr Bramble.--His name is Mr Dennison, one of the worthiest men\r\nliving; and his lady is a perfect saint upon earth. They have an only\r\nson--who do you think is this only son?--O Letty!--O gracious heaven!\r\nhow my heart palpitates, when I tell you that this only son of Mr\r\nDennison’s, is that very identical youth who, under the name of Wilson,\r\nhas made such ravage in my heart!--Yes, my dear friend! Wilson and I are\r\nnow lodged in the same house, and converse together freely--His father\r\napproves of his sentiments in my favour; his mother loves me with all\r\nthe tenderness of a parent; my uncle, my aunt and my brother, no longer\r\noppose my inclinations--On the contrary, they have agreed to make us\r\nhappy without delay; and in three weeks or a month, if no unforeseen\r\naccident intervenes, your friend Lydia Melford, will have changed her\r\nname and condition--I say, if no accident intervenes, because such a\r\ntorrent of success makes me tremble!--I wish there may not be something\r\ntreacherous in this sudden reconciliation of fortune--I have no merit--I\r\nhave no title to such felicity. Far from enjoying the prospect that\r\nlies before me, my mind is harrassed with a continued tumult, made up of\r\nhopes and wishes, doubts and apprehensions--I can neither eat nor sleep,\r\nand my spirits are in perpetual flutter.--I more than ever feel that\r\nvacancy in my heart, which your presence alone can fill.--The mind, in\r\nevery disquiet, seeks to repose itself on the bosom of a friend; and\r\nthis is such a trial as I really know not how to support without your\r\ncompany and counsel--I must, therefore, dear Letty, put your friendship\r\nto the test--I must beg you will come and do the last offices of\r\nmaidenhood to your companion Lydia Melford.\r\n\r\nThis letter goes inclosed in one to our worthy governess, from Mrs\r\nDennison, entreating her to interpose with your mamma, that you may be\r\nallowed to favour us with your company on this occasion; and I flatter\r\nmyself that no material objection can be made to our request. The\r\ndistance from hence to Gloucester, does not exceed one hundred miles,\r\nand the roads are good.--Mr Clinker, alias Loyd, shall be sent over to\r\nattend your motions--If you step into the post-chaise, with your maid\r\nBetty Barker, at seven in the morning, you will arrive by four in the\r\nafternoon at the half-way house, where there is good accommodation.\r\nThere you shall be met by my brother and myself, who will next day\r\nconduct you to this place, where, I am sure, you will find yourself\r\nperfectly at your case in the midst of an agreeable society.--Dear\r\nLetty, I will take no refusal--if you have any friendship--any\r\nhumanity--you will come.--I desire that immediate application may be\r\nmade to your mamma; and that the moment her permission is obtained, you\r\nwill apprise\r\n\r\nYour ever faithful, LYDIA MELFORD Oct. 14.\r\n\nTo Mrs JERMYN, at her house in Gloucester.\r\n\r\nDEAR MADAM,\r\n\r\nThough I was not so fortunate as to be favoured with an answer to the\r\nletter with which I troubled you in the spring, I still flatter myself\r\nthat you retain some regard for me and my concerns. I am sure the care\r\nand tenderness with which I was treated, under your roof and tuition,\r\ndemand the warmest returns of gratitude and affection on my part, and\r\nthese sentiments, I hope, I shall cherish to my dying day--At present,\r\nI think it my duty to make you acquainted with the happy issue of that\r\nindiscretion by which I incurred your displeasure.--Ah! madam, the\r\nslighted Wilson is metamorphosed into George Dennison, only son and heir\r\nof a gentleman, whose character is second to none in England, as you may\r\nunderstand upon inquiry. My guardian, my brother and I, are now in his\r\nhouse; and an immediate union of the two families is to take place in\r\nthe persons of the young gentleman and your poor Lydia Melford.--You\r\nwill easily conceive how embarrassing this situation must be to a young\r\ninexperienced creature like me, of weak nerves and strong apprehensions;\r\nand how much the presence of a friend and confidant would encourage and\r\nsupport me on this occasion. You know, that of all the young ladies,\r\nMiss Willis was she that possessed the greatest share of my confidence\r\nand affection; and, therefore, I fervently wish to have the happiness of\r\nher company at this interesting crisis.\r\n\r\nMrs Dennison, who is the object of universal love and esteem, has, at\r\nmy request, written to you on this subject, and I now beg leave to\r\nreinforce her sollicitations.--My dear Mrs Jermyn! my ever honoured\r\ngoverness! let me conjure you by that fondness which once distinguished\r\nyour favourite Lydia! by that benevolence of heart, which disposes you\r\nto promote the happiness of your fellow-creatures in general! lend\r\na favourable ear to my petition, and use your influence with Letty’s\r\nmamma, that my most earnest desire may be gratified. Should I be\r\nindulged in this particular, I will engage to return her safe, and even\r\nto accompany her to Gloucester, where, if you will give me leave, I will\r\npresent to you, under another name,\r\n\r\nDear Madam, Your most affectionate Humble servant, And penitent, LYDIA\r\nMELFORD Oct. 14.\r\n\nTo Mrs MARY JONES, at Brambleton-hall.\r\n\r\nO MARY JONES! MARY JONES!\r\n\r\nI have met with so many axidents, suprisals, and terrifications, that\r\nI am in a pafeck fantigo, and I believe I shall never be my own self\r\nagain. Last week I was dragged out of a river like a drowned rat, and\r\nlost a bran-new night-cap, with a sulfer stayhook, that cost me a good\r\nhalf-a-crown, and an odd shoe of green gallow monkey; besides wetting my\r\ncloaths and taring my smuck, and an ugly gash made in the back part of\r\nmy thy, by the stump of a tree--To be sure Mr Clinker tuck me out of the\r\ncox; but he left me on my back in the water, to go to the ‘squire; and I\r\nmought have had a watry grave, if a millar had not brought me to the dry\r\nland--But, O! what choppings and changes girl--The player man that came\r\nafter Miss Liddy, and frightened me with a beard at Bristol Well, is now\r\nmatthew-murphy’d into a fine young gentleman, son and hare of ‘squire\r\nDollison--We are all together in the same house, and all parties have\r\nagreed to the match, and in a fortnite the surrymony will be performed.\r\n\r\nBut this is not the only wedding we are to have--Mistriss is resolved\r\nto have the same frolick, in the naam of God! Last Sunday in the parish\r\ncrutch, if my own ars may be trusted, the clerk called the banes of\r\nmarridge betwixt Opaniah Lashmeheygo, and Tapitha Brample, spinster; he\r\nmought as well have called her inkle-weaver, for she never spun and hank\r\nof yarn in her life--Young ‘squire Dollison and Miss Liddy make the\r\nsecond kipple; and there might have been a turd, but times are changed\r\nwith Mr Clinker--O Molly! what do’st think? Mr Clinker is found to be a\r\npye-blow of our own ‘squire, and his rite naam is Mr Matthew Loyd (thof\r\nGod he nose how that can be); and he is now out of livery, and wares\r\nruffles--but I new him when he was out at elbows, and had not a rag to\r\nkiver his pistereroes; so he need not hold his head so high--He is for\r\nsartin very umble and compleasant, and purtests as how he has the same\r\nregard as before; but that he is no longer his own master, and cannot\r\nportend to marry without the ‘squire’s consent--He says he must wait\r\nwith patience, and trust to Providence, and such nonsense--But if so be\r\nas how his regard be the same, why stand shilly shally? Why not strike\r\nwhile the iron is hot, and speak to the ‘squire without loss of time?\r\nWhat subjection can the ‘squire make to our coming together--Thof my\r\nfather wan’t a gentleman, my mother was an honest woman--I didn’t come\r\non the wrong side of the blanket, girl--My parents were marred according\r\nto the right of holy mother crutch, in the face of men and angles--Mark\r\nthat, Mary Jones.\r\n\r\nMr Clinker (Loyd I would say) had best look to his tackle. There be\r\nother chaps in the market, as the saying is--What would he say if I\r\nshould except the soot and sarvice of the young squire’s valley? Mr\r\nMachappy is a gentleman born, and has been abroad in the wars--He has a\r\nworld of buck larning, and speaks French, and Ditch, and Scotch, and all\r\nmanner of outlandish lingos; to be sure he’s a little the worse for the\r\nware, and is much given to drink; but then he’s good-tempered in his\r\nliquor, and a prudent woman mought wind him about her finger--But I have\r\nno thoughts of him, I’ll assure you--I scorn for to do, or to say, or\r\nto think any thing that mought give unbreech to Mr Loyd, without furder\r\noccasion--But then I have such vapours, Molly I sit and cry by myself,\r\nand take ass of etida, and smill to burnt fathers, and kindal-snuffs;\r\nand I pray constantly for grease, that I may have a glimpse of the\r\nnew-light, to shew me the way through this wretched veil of tares. And\r\nyet, I want for nothing in this family of love, where every sole is so\r\nkind and so courteous, that wan would think they are so many saints in\r\nhaven. Dear Molly, I recommend myself to your prayers, being, with my\r\nsarvice to Saul,\r\n\r\nyour ever loving, and discounselled friend, WIN. JENKINS Oct. 14.\r\n\nTo Dr LEWIS.\r\n\r\nDEAR DICK,\r\n\r\nYou cannot imagine what pleasure I have in seeing your hand-writing,\r\nafter such a long cessation on your side of our correspondence--Yet,\r\nHeaven knows, I have often seen your hand-writing with disgust--I mean,\r\nwhen it appeared in abbreviations of apothecary’s Latin--I like your\r\nhint of making interest for the reversion of the collector’s place, for\r\nMr Lismahago, who is much pleased with the scheme, and presents you\r\nwith his compliments and best thanks for thinking so kindly of his\r\nconcerns--The man seems to mend, upon further acquaintance. That harsh\r\nreserve, which formed a disagreeable husk about his character, begins to\r\npeel off in the course of our communication--I have great hopes that\r\nhe and Tabby will be as happily paired as any two draught animals in\r\nthe kingdom; and I make no doubt but that he will prove a valuable\r\nacquisition to our little society, in the article of conversation, by\r\nthe fire-side in winter.\r\n\r\nYour objection to my passing this season of the year at such a distance\r\nfrom home, would have more weight if I did not find myself perfectly at\r\nmy ease where I am; and my health so much improved, that I am disposed\r\nto bid defiance to gout and rheumatism--I begin to think I have put\r\nmyself on the superannuated list too soon, and absurdly sought\r\nfor health in the retreats of laziness--I am persuaded that all\r\nvaletudinarians are too sedentary, too regular, and too cautious--We\r\nshould sometimes increase the motion of the machine, to unclog the\r\nwheels of life; and now and then take a plunge amidst the waves of\r\nexcess, in order to caseharden the constitution. I have even found a\r\nchange of company as necessary as a change of air, to promote a vigorous\r\ncirculation of the spirits, which is the very essence and criterion of\r\ngood health.\r\n\r\nSince my last, I have been performing the duties of friendship, that\r\nrequired a great deal of exercise, from which I hope to derive some\r\nbenefit--Understanding, by the greatest accident in the world, that\r\nMr Baynard’s wife was dangerously ill of a pleuritic fever, I borrowed\r\nDennison’s post-chaise, and went across the country to his habitation,\r\nattended only by Loyd (quondam Clinker) on horseback.--As the distance\r\nis not above thirty miles, I arrived about four in the afternoon, and\r\nmeeting the physician at the door, was informed that his patient had\r\njust expired.--I was instantly seized with a violent emotion, but it\r\nwas not grief.--The family being in confusion, I ran up stairs into\r\nthe chamber, where, indeed, they were all assembled.--The aunt stood\r\nwringing her hands in a kind of stupefaction of sorrow, but my friend\r\nacted all the extravagancies of affliction--He held the body in his\r\narms, and poured forth such a lamentation, that one would have thought\r\nhe had lost the most amiable consort and valuable companion upon earth.\r\n\r\nAffection may certainly exist independent of esteem; nay, the same\r\nobject may be lovely in one respect, and detestable in another--The mind\r\nhas a surprising faculty of accommodating, and even attaching itself,\r\nin such a manner, by dint of use, to things that are in their own nature\r\ndisagreeable, and even pernicious, that it cannot bear to be delivered\r\nfrom them without reluctance and regret. Baynard was so absorbed in his\r\ndelirium, that he did not perceive me when I entered, and desired one of\r\nthe women to conduct the aunt into her own chamber.--At the same time I\r\nbegged the tutor to withdraw the boy, who stood gaping in a corner,\r\nvery little affected with the distress of the scene.--These steps being\r\ntaken, I waited till the first violence of my friend’s transport was\r\nabated, then disengaged him gently from the melancholy object, and led\r\nhim by the hand into another apartment; though he struggled so hard,\r\nthat I was obliged to have recourse to the assistance of his valet de\r\nchambre--In a few minutes, however, he recollected himself, and folding\r\nme in his arms, ‘This (cried he), is a friendly office, indeed!--I know\r\nnot how you came hither; but, I think, Heaven sent you to prevent my\r\ngoing distracted--O Matthew! I have lost my dear Harriet!--my poor,\r\ngentle, tender creature, that loved me with such warmth and purity of\r\naffection--my constant companion of twenty years! She’s gone--she’s gone\r\nfor ever!--Heaven and earth! where is she?--Death shall not part us!’\r\n\r\nSo saying, he started up, and could hardly be with-held from returning\r\nto the scene we had quitted--You will perceive it would have been very\r\nabsurd for me to argue with a man that talked so madly.--On all such\r\noccasions, the first torrent of passion must be allowed to subside\r\ngradually.--I endeavoured to beguile his attention by starting little\r\nhints and insinuating other objects of discourse imperceptibly; and\r\nbeing exceedingly pleased in my own mind at this event, I exerted\r\nmyself with such an extraordinary flow of spirits as was attended with\r\nsuccess.--In a few hours, he was calm enough to hear reason, and even to\r\nown that Heaven could not have interposed more effectually to rescue\r\nhim from disgrace and ruin.--That he might not, however, relapse into\r\nweaknesses for want of company, I passed the night in his chamber, in a\r\nlittle tent bed brought thither on purpose; and well it was I took\r\nthis precaution, for he started up in bed several times, and would have\r\nplayed the fool, if I had not been present.\r\n\r\nNext day he was in a condition to talk of business, and vested me with\r\nfull authority over his household, which I began to exercise without\r\nloss of time, tho’ not before he knew and approved of the scheme I\r\nhad projected for his advantage.--He would have quitted the house\r\nimmediately; but this retreat I opposed.--Far from encouraging a\r\ntemporary disgust, which might degenerate into an habitual aversion,\r\nI resolved, if possible, to attach him more than ever to his Houshold\r\nGods.--I gave directions for the funeral to be as private as was\r\nconsistant with decency; I wrote to London, that an inventory and\r\nestimate might be made of the furniture and effects in his town-house,\r\nand gave notice to the landlord, that Mr Baynard should quit the\r\npremises at Lady-day; I set a person at work to take account of every\r\nthing in the country-house, including horses, carriages, and harness; I\r\nsettled the young gentleman at a boarding-school, kept by a clergyman in\r\nthe neighbourhood, and thither he went without reluctance, as soon as\r\nhe knew that he was to be troubled no more with his tutor, whom we\r\ndismissed. The aunt continued very sullen, and never appeared at\r\ntable, though Mr Baynard payed his respects to her every day in her\r\nown chamber; there also she held conferences with the waiting-women and\r\nother servants of the family: but, the moment her niece was interred,\r\nshe went away in a post-chaise prepared for that purpose: she did not\r\nleave the house, however, without giving Mr Baynard to understand, that\r\nthe wardrobe of her niece was the perquisite of her woman; accordingly\r\nthat worthless drab received all the clothes, laces, and linen of her\r\ndeceased mistress, to the value of five hundred pounds, at a moderate\r\ncomputation.\r\n\r\nThe next step I took was to disband that legion of supernumerary\r\ndomestics, who had preyed so long upon the vitals of my friend:, a\r\nparcel of idle drones, so intolerably insolent, that they even treated\r\ntheir own master with the most contemptuous neglect. They had been\r\ngenerally hired by his wife, according to the recommendation of her\r\nwoman, and these were the only patrons to whom they payed the least\r\ndeference. I had therefore uncommon satisfaction in clearing the house\r\nof these vermin. The woman of the deceased, and a chambermaid, a valet\r\nde chambre, a butler, a French cook, a master gardener, two footmen and\r\na coachman, I payed off, and turned out of the house immediately, paying\r\nto each a month’s wages in lieu of warning. Those whom I retained,\r\nconsisted of the female cook, who had been assistant to the Frenchman,\r\na house maid, an old lacquey, a postilion, and under-gardener. Thus I\r\nremoved at once a huge mountain of expence and care from the shoulders\r\nof my friend, who could hardly believe the evidence of his own senses,\r\nwhen he found himself so suddenly and so effectually relieved. His\r\nheart, however, was still subject to vibrations of tenderness,\r\nwhich returned at certain intervals, extorting sighs, and tears, and\r\nexclamations of grief and impatience: but these fits grew every day\r\nless violent and less frequent, ‘till at length his reason obtained a\r\ncomplete victory over the infirmities of his nature.\r\n\r\nUpon an accurate enquiry into the state of his affairs, I find his debts\r\namount to twenty thousand pounds, for eighteen thousand pounds of which\r\nsum his estate is mortgaged; and as he pays five per cent. interest, and\r\nsome of his farms are unoccupied, he does not receive above two hundred\r\npounds a year clear from his lands, over and above the interest of\r\nhis wife’s fortune, which produced eight hundred pounds annually. For\r\nlightening this heavy burthen, I devised the following expedient. His\r\nwife’s jewels, together with his superfluous plate and furniture in both\r\nhouses, his horses and carriages, which are already advertised to be\r\nsold by auction, will, according to the estimate, produce two thousand\r\nfive hundred pounds in ready money, with which the debt will be\r\nimmediately reduced to eighteen thousand pounds--I have undertaken to\r\nfind him ten thousand pounds at four per cent. by which means he will\r\nsave one hundred a-year in the article of interest, and perhaps we shall\r\nbe able to borrow the other eight thousand on the same terms. According\r\nto his own scheme of a country life, he says he can live comfortably for\r\nthree hundred pounds a-year; but, as he has a son to educate, we will\r\nallow him five hundred; then there will be an accumulating fund of seven\r\nhundred a-year, principal and interest, to pay off the incumbrance;\r\nand, I think, we may modestly add three hundred, on the presumption\r\nof new-leasing and improving the vacant farms: so that, in a couple of\r\nyears, I suppose there will be above a thousand a-year appropriated to\r\nliquidate a debt of sixteen thousand.\r\n\r\nWe forthwith began to class and set apart the articles designed for\r\nsale, under the direction of an upholder from London; and, that nobody\r\nin the house might be idle, commenced our reformation without doors,\r\nas well as within. With Baynard’s good leave, I ordered the gardener to\r\nturn the rivulet into its old channel, to refresh the fainting Naiads,\r\nwho had so long languished among mouldring roots, withered leaves, and\r\ndry pebbles--The shrubbery is condemned to extirpation; and the\r\npleasure ground will be restored to its original use of corn-field and\r\npasture--Orders are given for rebuilding the walls of the garden at the\r\nback of the house, and for planting clumps of firs, intermingled with\r\nbeech and chestnut, at the east end, which is now quite exposed to the\r\nsurly blasts that come from that quarter. All these works being actually\r\nbegun, and the house and auction left to the care and management of a\r\nreputable attorney, I brought Baynard along with me in the chaise, and\r\nmade him acquainted with Dennison, whose goodness of heart would not\r\nfail to engage his esteem and affection.--He is indeed charmed with our\r\nsociety in general, and declares that he never saw the theory of true\r\npleasure reduced to practice before. I really believe it would not be an\r\neasy task to find such a number of individuals assembled under one roof,\r\nmore happy than we are at present.\r\n\r\nI must tell you, however, in confidence, I suspect Tabby of\r\ntergiversation.--I have been so long accustomed to that original, that\r\nI know all the caprices of her heart, and can often perceive her designs\r\nwhile they are yet in embrio--She attached herself to Lismahago for no\r\nother reason but that she despaired of making a more agreeable conquest.\r\nAt present, if I am not much mistaken in my observation, she would\r\ngladly convert the widowhood of Baynard to her own advantage.--Since\r\nhe arrived, she has behaved very coldly to the captain, and strove to\r\nfasten on the other’s heart, with the hooks of overstrained civility.\r\nThese must be the instinctive efforts of her constitution, rather than\r\nthe effects of any deliberate design; for matters are carried to such a\r\nlength with the lieutenant, that she could not retract with any regard\r\nto conscience or reputation. Besides, she will meet with nothing but\r\nindifference or aversion on the side of Baynard, who has too much sense\r\nto think of such a partner at any time, and too much delicacy to admit a\r\nthought of any such connexion at the present juncture--Meanwhile, I have\r\nprevailed upon her to let him have four thousand pounds at four per cent\r\ntowards paying off his mortage. Young Dennison has agreed that\r\nLiddy’s fortune shall be appropriated to the same purpose, on the same\r\nterms.--His father will sell out three thousand pounds stock for his\r\naccommodation.--Farmer Bland has, at the desire of Wilson, undertaken\r\nfor two thousand; and I must make an effort to advance what further will\r\nbe required to take my friend out of the hands of the Philistines. He\r\nis so pleased with the improvements made on his estate, which is all\r\ncultivated like a garden, that he has entered himself as a pupil in\r\nfarming to Mr Dennison, and resolved to attach himself wholly to the\r\npractice of husbandry.\r\n\r\nEvery thing is now prepared for our double wedding. The\r\nmarriage-articles for both couples are drawn and executed; and the\r\nceremony only waits until the parties shall have been resident in the\r\nparish the term prescribed by law. Young Dennison betrays some symptoms\r\nof impatience; but, Lismahago bears this necessary delay with the temper\r\nof a philosopher.--You must know, the captain does not stand altogether\r\non the foundation of personal merit. Besides his half-pay, amounting to\r\ntwo and forty pounds a year, this indefatigable oeconomist has amassed\r\neight hundred pounds, which he has secured in the funds. This sum arises\r\npartly from his pay’s running up while he remained among the Indians;\r\npartly from what he received as a consideration for the difference\r\nbetween his full appointment and the half-pay, to which he is now\r\nrestricted; and partly from the profits of a little traffick he drove in\r\npeltry, during his sachemship among the Miamis.\r\n\r\nLiddy’s fears and perplexities have been much assuaged by the company\r\nof one Miss Willis, who had been her intimate companion at the\r\nboarding-school. Her parents had been earnestly sollicited to allow her\r\nmaking this friendly visit on such an extraordinary occasion; and two\r\ndays ago she arrived with her mother, who did not chuse that she should\r\ncome without a proper gouvernante. The young lady is very sprightly,\r\nhandsome, and agreeable, and the mother a mighty good sort of a woman;\r\nso that their coming adds considerably to our enjoyment. But we shall\r\nhave a third couple yoked in the matrimonial chain. Mr Clinker Loyd has\r\nmade humble remonstrance through the canal of my nephew, setting forth\r\nthe sincere love and affection mutually subsisting between him and Mrs\r\nWinifred Jenkins, and praying my consent to their coming together for\r\nlife. I would have wished that Mr Clinker had kept out of this scrape;\r\nbut as the nymph’s happiness is at stake, and she has already some\r\nfits in the way of despondence, I, in order to prevent any tragical\r\ncatastrophe, have given him leave to play the fool, in imitation of\r\nhis betters; and I suppose we shall in time have a whole litter of his\r\nprogeny at Brambleton-hall. The fellow is stout and lusty, very sober\r\nand conscientious; and the wench seems to be as great an enthusiast in\r\nlove as in religion.\r\n\r\nI wish you would think of employing him some other way, that the\r\nparish may not be overstocked--you know he has been bred a farrier,\r\nconsequently belongs to the faculty; and as he is very docile, I make\r\nno doubt but, with your good instruction, he may be, in a little time,\r\nqualified to act as a Welch apothecary. Tabby, who never did a favour\r\nwith a good grace, has consented, with great reluctance, to this match.\r\nPerhaps it hurts her pride, as she now considers Clinker in the light of\r\na relation; but, I believe, her objections are of a more selfish nature.\r\nShe declares she cannot think of retaining the wife of Matthew Loyd in\r\nthe character of a servant; and she foresees, that on such an occasion\r\nthe woman will expect some gratification for her past services. As for\r\nClinker, exclusive of other considerations, he is so trusty, brave,\r\naffectionate, and alert, and I owe him such personal obligations, that\r\nhe merits more than all the indulgence that can possibly be shewn him,\r\nby\r\n\r\nYours, MATT. BRAMBLE Oct. 26.\r\n\nTo Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bart. at Oxon.\r\n\r\nDEAR KNIGHT,\r\n\r\nThe fatal knots are now tied. The comedy is near a close; and the\r\ncurtain is ready to drop: but, the latter scenes of this act I shall\r\nrecapitulate in order--About a fortnight ago, my uncle made an excursion\r\nacross the country, and brought hither a particular friend, one Mr\r\nBaynard, who has just lost his wife, and was for some time disconsolate,\r\nthough by all accounts he had much more cause for joy than for sorrow at\r\nthis event.--His countenance, however, clears up apace; and he appears\r\nto be a person of rare accomplishments.--But, we have received another\r\nstill more agreeable reinforcement to our company, by the arrival\r\nof Miss Willis from Gloucester. She was Liddy’s bosom friend at the\r\nboarding-school, and being earnestly sollicited to assist at the\r\nnuptials, her mother was so obliging as to grant my sister’s request,\r\nand even to come with her in person. Liddy, accompanied by George\r\nDennison and me, gave them the meeting halfway, and next day conducted\r\nthem hither in safety. Miss Willis is a charming girl, and, in point of\r\ndisposition, an agreeable contrast to my sister, who is rather too grave\r\nand sentimental for my turn of mind. The other is gay, frank, a little\r\ngiddy, and always good-humoured. She has, moreover, a genteel fortune,\r\nis well born, and remarkably handsome. Ah Phillips! if these qualities\r\nwere permanent--if her humour would never change, nor her beauties\r\ndecay, what efforts would I not make--But these are idle reflections--my\r\ndestiny must one day be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nAt present we pass the time as agreeably as we can.--We have got up\r\nseveral farces, which afforded unspeakable entertainment by the effects\r\nthey produced among the country people, who are admitted to all our\r\nexhibitions.--Two nights ago, Jack Wilson acquired great applause in\r\nHarlequin Skeleton, and Lismahago surprised us all in the character\r\nof Pierot.--His long lank sides, and strong marked features, were all\r\npeculiarly adapted to his part.--He appeared with a ludicrous stare,\r\nfrom which he had discharged all meaning: he adopted the impressions of\r\nfear and amazement so naturally, that many of the audience were infected\r\nby his looks; but when the skeleton held him in chace his horror\r\nbecame most divertingly picturesque, and seemed to endow him with such\r\npraeternatural agility as confounded all the spectators. It was a lively\r\nrepresentation of Death in pursuit of Consumption, and had such an\r\neffect upon the commonalty, that some of them shrieked aloud, and others\r\nran out of the hall in the utmost consternation.\r\n\r\nThis is not the only instance in which the lieutenant has lately\r\nexcited our wonder. His temper, which had been soured and shrivelled\r\nby disappointment and chagrin, is now swelled out, and smoothed like\r\na raisin in plumb-porridge. From being reserved and punctilious, he is\r\nbecome easy and obliging. He cracks jokes, laughs and banters, with the\r\nmost facetious familiarity; and, in a word, enters into all our schemes\r\nof merriment and pastime--The other day his baggage arrived in the\r\nwaggon from London, contained in two large trunks and a long deal box\r\nnot unlike a coffin. The trunks were filled with his wardrobe, which\r\nhe displayed for the entertainment of the company, and he freely owned,\r\nthat it consisted chiefly of the opima spolia taken in battle. What he\r\nselected for his wedding suit, was a tarnished white cloth faced with\r\nblue velvet, embroidered with silver; but, he valued himself most upon a\r\ntye-periwig, in which he had made his first appearance as a lawyer above\r\nthirty years ago. This machine had been in buckle ever since, and now\r\nall the servants in the family were employed to frizz it out for the\r\noccasion, which was yesterday celebrated at the parish church. George\r\nDennison and his bride were distinguished by nothing extraordinary\r\nin their apparel. His eyes lightened with eagerness and joy, and she\r\ntrembled with coyness and confusion. My uncle gave her away, and her\r\nfriend Willis supported her during the ceremony.\r\n\r\nBut my aunt and her paramour took the pas, and formed, indeed, such a\r\npair of originals, as, I believe all England could not parallel. She was\r\ndressed in the stile of 1739; and the day being cold, put on a\r\nmanteel of green velvet laced with gold: but this was taken off by the\r\nbridegroom, who threw over her shoulders a fur cloak of American sables,\r\nvalued at fourscore guineas, a present equally agreeable and unexpected.\r\nThus accoutred, she was led up to the altar by Mr Dennison, who did the\r\noffice of her father: Lismahago advanced in the military step with\r\nhis French coat reaching no farther than the middle of his thigh, his\r\ncampaign wig that surpasses all description, and a languishing leer\r\nupon his countenance, in which there seemed to be something arch and\r\nironical. The ring, which he put upon her finger, he had concealed\r\ntill the moment it was used. He now produced it with an air of\r\nself-complacency. It was a curious antique, set with rose diamonds: he\r\ntold us afterwards, it had been in the family two hundred years and was\r\na present from his grand-mother. These circumstances agreeably flattered\r\nthe pride of our aunt Tabitha, which had already found uncommon\r\ngratification in the captain’s generosity; for he had, in the morning,\r\npresented my uncle with a fine bear’s skin, and a Spanish fowling-piece,\r\nand me with a case of pistols curiously mounted with silver. At the same\r\ntime he gave Mrs Jenkins an Indian purse, made of silk grass, containing\r\ntwenty crown pieces. You must know, this young lady, with the assistance\r\nof Mr Loyd, formed the third couple who yesterday sacrificed to Hymen.\r\nI wrote to you in my last, that he had recourse to my mediation, which I\r\nemployed successfully with my uncle; but Mrs Tabitha held out ‘till the\r\nlove-sick Jenkins had two fits of the mother; then she relented, and\r\nthose two cooing turtles were caged for life--Our aunt made an effort of\r\ngenerosity in furnishing the bride with her superfluities of clothes and\r\nlinen, and her example was followed by my sister; nor did Mr Bramble\r\nand I neglect her on this occasion. It was, indeed, a day of\r\npeace-offering.--Mr Dennison insisted upon Liddy’s accepting two bank\r\nnotes of one hundred pounds each, as pocket-money; and his lady gave her\r\na diamond necklace of double that value. There was, besides, a mutual\r\nexchange of tokens among the individuals of the two families thus\r\nhappily united.\r\n\r\nAs George Dennison and his partner were judged improper objects of\r\nmirth, Jack Wilson had resolved to execute some jokes on Lismahago, and\r\nafter supper began to ply him with bumpers, when the ladies had retired;\r\nbut the captain perceiving his drift, begged for quarter, alledging that\r\nthe adventure, in which he had engaged, was a very serious matter; and\r\nthat it would be more the part of a good Christian to pray that he\r\nmight be strengthened, than to impede his endeavours to finish the\r\nadventure.--He was spared accordingly, and permitted to ascend the\r\nnuptial couch with all his senses about him.--There he and his consort\r\nsat in state, like Saturn and Cybele, while the benediction posset was\r\ndrank; and a cake being broken over the head of Mrs Tabitha Lismahago,\r\nthe fragments were distributed among the bystanders, according to the\r\ncustom of the antient Britons, on the supposition that every person who\r\neat of this hallowed cake, should that night have a vision of the man or\r\nwoman whom Heaven designed should be his or her wedded mate.\r\n\r\nThe weight of Wilson’s waggery fell upon honest Humphry and his spouse,\r\nwho were bedded in an upper room, with the usual ceremony of throwing\r\nthe stocking.--This being performed, and the company withdrawn, a sort\r\nof catterwauling ensued, when Jack found means to introduce a real cat\r\nshod with walnut-shells, which galloping along the boards, made such a\r\ndreadful noise as effectually discomposed our lovers.--Winifred screamed\r\naloud, and shrunk under the bed-cloaths--Mr Loyd, believing that\r\nSatan was come to buffet him in propria persona, laid aside all carnal\r\nthoughts, and began to pray aloud with great fervency.--At length, the\r\npoor animal, being more afraid than either, leaped into the bed, and\r\nmeauled with the most piteous exclamation.--Loyd, thus informed of the\r\nnature of the annoyance, rose and set the door wide open, so that this\r\ntroublesome visitant retreated with great expedition; then securing\r\nhimself, by means of a double bolt, from a second intrusion, he was left\r\nto enjoy his good fortune without further disturbance.\r\n\r\nIf one may judge from the looks of the parties, they are all very well\r\nsatisfied with what has passed--George Dennison and his wife are\r\ntoo delicate to exhibit any strong marked signs of their mutual\r\nsatisfaction, but their eyes are sufficiently expressive--Mrs Tabitha\r\nLismahago is rather fulsome in signifying her approbation of the\r\ncaptain’s love; while his deportment is the very pink of gallantry.--He\r\nsighs, and ogles, and languishes at this amiable object; he kisses her\r\nhand, mutters ejaculations of rapture, and sings tender airs; and, no\r\ndoubt, laughs internally at her folly in believing him sincere.--In\r\norder to shew how little his vigour was impaired by the fatigues of the\r\npreceding day, he this morning danced a Highland sarabrand over a\r\nnaked back-sword, and leaped so high, that I believe he would make no\r\ncontemptible figure as a vaulter at Sadler’s Wells.--Mr Matthew Loyd,\r\nwhen asked how he relished his bargain, throws up his eyes, crying,\r\n‘For what we have received, Lord make us thankful: amen.’--His helpmate\r\ngiggles, and holds her hand before her eyes, affecting to be ashamed\r\nof having been in bed with a man.--Thus all these widgeons enjoy the\r\nnovelty of their situation; but, perhaps their notes will be changed,\r\nwhen they are better acquainted with the nature of the decoy.\r\n\r\nAs Mrs Willis cannot be persuaded to stay, and Liddy is engaged by\r\npromise to accompany her daughter back to Gloucester, I fancy there will\r\nbe a general migration from hence, and that most of us will spend the\r\nChristmas holidays at Bath; in which case, I shall certainly find an\r\nopportunity to beat up your quarters.--By this time, I suppose, you\r\nare sick of alma mater, and even ready to execute that scheme of\r\nperegrination, which was last year concerted between you and\r\n\r\nYour affectionate J. MELFORD Nov. 8.\r\n\nTo Dr LEWIS.\r\n\r\nDEAR DOCTOR,\r\n\r\nMy niece Liddy is now happily settled for life; and captain Lismahago\r\nhas taken Tabby off my hands; so that I have nothing further to do, but\r\nto comfort my friend Baynard, and provide for my son Loyd, who is also\r\nfairly joined to Mrs Winifred Jenkins. You are an excellent genius at\r\nhints.--Dr Arbuthnot was but a type of Dr Lewis in that respect. What\r\nyou observe of the vestry-clerk deserves consideration.--I make no\r\ndoubt but Matthew Loyd is well enough qualified for the office; but,\r\nat present, you must find room for him in the house.--His incorruptible\r\nhonesty and indefatigable care will be serviceable in superintending\r\nthe oeconomy of my farm; tho’ I don’t mean that he shall interfere with\r\nBarns, of whom I have no cause to complain.--I am just returned with\r\nBaynard, from a second trip to his house, where every thing is regulated\r\nto his satisfaction.--He could not, however, review the apartments\r\nwithout tears and lamentation, so that he is not yet in a condition to\r\nbe left alone; therefore I will not part with him till the spring, when\r\nhe intends to plunge into the avocations of husbandry, which will at\r\nonce employ and amuse his attention.--Charles Dennison has promised to\r\nstay with him a fortnight, to set him fairly afloat in his improvements;\r\nand Jack Wilson will see him from time to time; besides, he has a few\r\nfriends in the country, whom his new plan of life will not exclude from\r\nhis society.--In less than a year, I make no doubt, but he will find\r\nhimself perfectly at ease both in his mind and body, for the one had\r\ndangerously affected the other; and I shall enjoy the exquisite pleasure\r\nof seeing my friend rescued from misery and contempt.\r\n\r\nMrs Willis being determined to return with her daughter, in a few\r\ndays, to Gloucester, our plan has undergone some alteration. Jery has\r\npersuaded his brother-in-law to carry his wife to Bath; and I believe\r\nhis parents will accompany him thither.--For my part, I have no\r\nintention to take that route.--It must be something very extraordinary\r\nthat will induce me to revisit either Bath or London.--My sister and her\r\nhusband, Baynard and I, will take leave of them at Gloucester, and make\r\nthe best of our way to Brambleton hall, where I desire you will prepare\r\na good chine and turkey for our Christmas dinner.--You must also employ\r\nyour medical skill in defending me from the attacks of the gout, that I\r\nmay be in good case to receive the rest of our company, who promise\r\nto visit us in their return from the Bath.--As I have laid in a\r\nconsiderable stock of health, it is to be hoped you will not have much\r\ntrouble with me in the way of physic, but I intend to work you on\r\nthe side of exercise.--I have got an excellent fowling-piece from Mr\r\nLismahago, who is a keen sportsman, and we shall take the heath in\r\nall weathers.--That this scheme of life may be prosecuted the more\r\neffectually, I intend to renounce all sedentary amusements, particularly\r\nthat of writing long letters; a resolution, which, had I taken it\r\nsooner, might have saved you the trouble which you have lately taken in\r\nreading the tedious epistles of\r\n\r\nMATT. BRAMBLE NOV. 20.\r\n\nTo Mrs GWYLLIM, at Brambleton-hall.\r\n\r\nGOOD MRS GWYLLIM,\r\n\r\nHeaven, for wise porpuses, hath ordained that I should change my name\r\nand citation in life, so that I am not to be considered any more\r\nas manager of my brother’s family; but as I cannot surrender up my\r\nstewardship till I have settled with you and Williams, I desire you will\r\nget your accunts ready for inspection, as we are coming home without\r\nfurther delay.--My spouse, the captain, being subject to rummaticks, I\r\nbeg you will take great care to have the blew chamber, up two pair of\r\nstairs, well warmed for his reception.--Let the sashes be secured, the\r\ncrevices stopt, the carpets laid, and the beds well tousled.--Mrs Loyd,\r\nlate Jenkins, being married to a relation of the family, cannot remain\r\nin the capacity of a sarvant; therefore, I wish you would cast about for\r\nsome creditable body to be with me in her room--If she can spin, and\r\nis mistress of plain-work, so much the better--but she must not expect\r\nextravagant wages--having a family of my own, I must be more occumenical\r\nthan ever. No more at present, but rests\r\n\r\nYour loving friend, TAB. LISMAHAGO NOV. 20.\r\n\nTo Mrs MARY JONES, at Brambleton-hall.\r\n\r\nMRS JONES,\r\n\r\nProvidinch hath bin pleased to make great halteration in the pasture\r\nof our affairs.--We were yesterday three kiple chined, by the grease of\r\nGod, in the holy bands of mattermoney, and I now subscrive myself Loyd\r\nat your sarvice.--All the parish allowed that young ‘squire Dallison and\r\nhis bride was a comely pear for to see.--As for madam Lashtniheygo, you\r\nnose her picklearities--her head, to be sure, was fintastical; and her\r\nspouse had rapt her with a long marokin furze cloak from the land of the\r\nselvidges, thof they say it is of immense bally.--The captain himself\r\nhad a huge hassock of air, with three tails, and a tum-tawdry coat,\r\nboddered with sulfur.--Wan said he was a monkey-bank; and the ould\r\nbottler swore he was the born imich of Titidall.--For my part, I says\r\nnothing, being as how the captain has done the handsome thing by me.--Mr\r\nLoyd was dressed in a lite frog, and checket with gould binding; and\r\nthof he don’t enter in caparison with great folks of quality, yet he has\r\ngot as good blood in his veins as arrow privat ‘squire in the county;\r\nand then his pursing is far from contentible.--Your humble sarvant had\r\non a plain pea-green tabby sack, with my Runnela cap, ruff toupee, and\r\nside curls.--They said, I was the very moral of lady Rickmanstone, but\r\nnot so pale--that may well be, for her ladyship is my elder by seven\r\ngood years and more.--Now, Mrs Mary, our satiety is to suppurate--Mr\r\nMillfart goes to Bath along with the Dallisons, and the rest of us\r\npush home to Wales, to pass our Chrishmarsh at Brampleton-hall--As our\r\napartments is to be the yallow pepper, in the thurd story, pray carry my\r\nthings thither.--Present my cumpliments to Mrs Gwyllim, and I hope\r\nshe and I will live upon dissent terms of civility.--Being, by God’s\r\nblessing, removed to a higher spear, you’ll excuse my being familiar\r\nwith the lower sarvants of the family; but, as I trust you’ll behave\r\nrespectful, and keep a proper distance, you may always depend upon the\r\ngood will and purtection of\r\n\r\nYours, W. LOYD Nov. 20.\r\n\r\nFINIS."
