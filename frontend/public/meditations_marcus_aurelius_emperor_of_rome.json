How free from all vanity he carried\r\nhimself in matter of honour and dignity, (as they are esteemed:) his\r\nlaboriousness and assiduity, his readiness to hear any man, that had\r\naught to say tending to any common good: how generally and impartially\r\nhe would give every man his due; his skill and knowledge, when rigour\r\nor extremity, or when remissness or moderation was in season; how he did\r\nabstain from all unchaste love of youths; his moderate condescending to\r\nother men's occasions as an ordinary man, neither absolutely requiring\r\nof his friends, that they should wait upon him at his ordinary meals,\r\nnor that they should of necessity accompany him in his journeys; and\r\nthat whensoever any business upon some necessary occasions was to be put\r\noff and omitted before it could be ended, he was ever found when he\r\nwent about it again, the same man that he was before. His accurate\r\nexamination of things in consultations, and patient hearing of others.\r\nHe would not hastily give over the search of the matter, as one easy to\r\nbe satisfied with sudden notions and apprehensions. His care to preserve\r\nhis friends; how neither at any time he would carry himself towards them\r\nwith disdainful neglect, and grow weary of them; nor yet at any time\r\nbe madly fond of them. His contented mind in all things, his cheerful\r\ncountenance, his care to foresee things afar off, and to take order for\r\nthe least, without any noise or clamour. Moreover how all acclamations\r\nand flattery were repressed by him: how carefully he observed all things\r\nnecessary to the government, and kept an account of the common expenses,\r\nand how patiently he did abide that he was reprehended by some for this\r\nhis strict and rigid kind of dealing. How he was neither a superstitious\r\nworshipper of the gods, nor an ambitious pleaser of men, or studious of\r\npopular applause; but sober in all things, and everywhere observant of\r\nthat which was fitting; no affecter of novelties: in those things which\r\nconduced to his ease and convenience, (plenty whereof his fortune\r\ndid afford him,) without pride and bragging, yet with all freedom and\r\nliberty: so that as he did freely enjoy them without any anxiety or\r\naffectation when they were present; so when absent, he found no want\r\nof them. Moreover, that he was never commended by any man, as either a\r\nlearned acute man, or an obsequious officious man, or a fine orator; but\r\nas a ripe mature man, a perfect sound man; one that could not endure to\r\nbe flattered; able to govern both himself and others. Moreover, how much\r\nhe did honour all true philosophers, without upbraiding those that were\r\nnot so; his sociableness, his gracious and delightful conversation, but\r\nnever unto satiety; his care of his body within bounds and measure,\r\nnot as one that desired to live long, or over-studious of neatness, and\r\nelegancy; and yet not as one that did not regard it: so that through his\r\nown care and providence, he seldom needed any inward physic, or outward\r\napplications: but especially how ingeniously he would yield to any that\r\nhad obtained any peculiar faculty, as either eloquence, or the knowledge\r\nof the laws, or of ancient customs, or the like; and how he concurred\r\nwith them, in his best care and endeavour that every one of them might\r\nin his kind, for that wherein he excelled, be regarded and esteemed: and\r\nalthough he did all things carefully after the ancient customs of his\r\nforefathers, yet even of this was he not desirous that men should take\r\nnotice, that he did imitate ancient customs. Again, how he was not\r\neasily moved and tossed up and down, but loved to be constant, both in\r\nthe same places and businesses; and how after his great fits of headache\r\nhe would return fresh and vigorous to his wonted affairs. Again, that\r\nsecrets he neither had many, nor often, and such only as concerned\r\npublic matters: his discretion and moderation, in exhibiting of the\r\npublic sights and shows for the pleasure and pastime of the people: in\r\npublic buildings. congiaries, and the like. In all these things,\r\nhaving a respect unto men only as men, and to the equity of the things\r\nthemselves, and not unto the glory that might follow. Never wont to\r\nuse the baths at unseasonable hours; no builder; never curious, or\r\nsolicitous, either about his meat, or about the workmanship, or colour\r\nof his clothes, or about anything that belonged to external beauty.\r\nIn all his conversation, far from all inhumanity, all boldness, and\r\nincivility, all greediness and impetuosity; never doing anything with\r\nsuch earnestness, and intention, that a man could say of him, that\r\nhe did sweat about it: but contrariwise, all things distinctly, as at\r\nleisure; without trouble; orderly, soundly, and agreeably. A man might\r\nhave applied that to him, which is recorded of Socrates, that he knew\r\nhow to want, and to enjoy those things, in the want whereof, most men\r\nshow themselves weak; and in the fruition, intemperate: but to hold out\r\nfirm and constant, and to keep within the compass of true moderation and\r\nsobriety in either estate, is proper to a man, who hath a perfect and\r\ninvincible soul; such as he showed himself in the sickness of Maximus."

That I was not long brought up by the concubine of my father;\r\nthat I preserved the flower of my youth. That I took not upon me to be\r\na man before my time, but rather put it off longer than I needed. That\r\nI lived under the government of my lord and father, who would take\r\naway from me all pride and vainglory, and reduce me to that conceit and\r\nopinion that it was not impossible for a prince to live in the court\r\nwithout a troop of guards and followers, extraordinary apparel, such\r\nand such torches and statues, and other like particulars of state and\r\nmagnificence; but that a man may reduce and contract himself almost to\r\nthe state of a private man, and yet for all that not to become the more\r\nbase and remiss in those public matters and affairs, wherein power and\r\nauthority is requisite. That I have had such a brother, who by his own\r\nexample might stir me up to think of myself; and by his respect and\r\nlove, delight and please me. That I have got ingenuous children, and\r\nthat they were not born distorted, nor with any other natural deformity.\r\nThat I was no great proficient in the study of rhetoric and poetry, and\r\nof other faculties, which perchance I might have dwelt upon, if I had\r\nfound myself to go on in them with success. That I did by times prefer\r\nthose, by whom I was brought up, to such places and dignities, which\r\nthey seemed unto me most to desire; and that I did not put them off with\r\nhope and expectation, that (since that they were yet but young) I would\r\ndo the same hereafter. That I ever knew Apollonius and Rusticus, and\r\nMaximus. That I have had occasion often and effectually to consider and\r\nmeditate with myself, concerning that life which is according to nature,\r\nwhat the nature and manner of it is: so that as for the gods and such\r\nsuggestions, helps and inspirations, as might be expected from them,\r\nnothing did hinder, but that I might have begun long before to live\r\naccording to nature; or that even now that I was not yet partaker and\r\nin present possession of that life, that I myself (in that I did not\r\nobserve those inward motions, and suggestions, yea and almost plain and\r\napparent instructions and admonitions of the gods,) was the only cause\r\nof it. That my body in such a life, hath been able to hold out so long.\r\nThat I never had to do with Benedicta and Theodotus, yea and afterwards\r\nwhen I fell into some fits of love, I was soon cured. That having been\r\noften displeased with Rusticus, I never did him anything for which\r\nafterwards I had occasion to repent. That it being so that my mother was\r\nto die young, yet she lived with me all her latter years. That as often\r\nas I had a purpose to help and succour any that either were poor, or\r\nfallen into some present necessity, I never was answered by my officers\r\nthat there was not ready money enough to do it; and that I myself never\r\nhad occasion to require the like succour from any other. That I have\r\nsuch a wife, so obedient, so loving, so ingenuous. That I had choice of\r\nfit and able men, to whom I might commit the bringing up of my children.\r\nThat by dreams I have received help, as for other things, so in\r\nparticular, how I might stay my casting of blood, and cure my dizziness,\r\nas that also that happened to thee in Cajeta, as unto Chryses when he\r\nprayed by the seashore. And when I did first apply myself to philosophy,\r\nthat I did not fall into the hands of some sophists, or spent my time\r\neither in reading the manifold volumes of ordinary philosophers, nor in\r\npractising myself in the solution of arguments and fallacies, nor dwelt\r\nupon the studies of the meteors, and other natural curiosities. All\r\nthese things without the assistance of the gods, and fortune, could not\r\nhave been."

Afford then thyself this retiring\r\ncontinually, and thereby refresh and renew thyself. Let these precepts\r\nbe brief and fundamental, which as soon as thou dost call them to mind,\r\nmay suffice thee to purge thy soul throughly, and to send thee away well\r\npleased with those things whatsoever they be, which now again after this\r\nshort withdrawing of thy soul into herself thou dost return unto. For\r\nwhat is it that thou art offended at? Can it be at the wickedness of\r\nmen, when thou dost call to mind this conclusion, that all reasonable\r\ncreatures are made one for another? and that it is part of justice to\r\nbear with them? and that it is against their wills that they offend?\r\nand how many already, who once likewise prosecuted their enmities,\r\nsuspected, hated, and fiercely contended, are now long ago stretched\r\nout, and reduced unto ashes? It is time for thee to make an end. As for\r\nthose things which among the common chances of the world happen unto\r\nthee as thy particular lot and portion, canst thou be displeased with\r\nany of them, when thou dost call that our ordinary dilemma to mind,\r\neither a providence, or Democritus his atoms; and with it, whatsoever we\r\nbrought to prove that the whole world is as it were one city? And as for\r\nthy body, what canst thou fear, if thou dost consider that thy mind and\r\nunderstanding, when once it hath recollected itself, and knows its own\r\npower, hath in this life and breath (whether it run smoothly and gently,\r\nor whether harshly and rudely), no interest at all, but is altogether\r\nindifferent: and whatsoever else thou hast heard and assented unto\r\nconcerning either pain or pleasure? But the care of thine honour and\r\nreputation will perchance distract thee? How can that be, if thou\r\ndost look back, and consider both how quickly all things that are, are\r\nforgotten, and what an immense chaos of eternity was before, and will\r\nfollow after all things: and the vanity of praise, and the inconstancy\r\nand variableness of human judgments and opinions, and the narrowness of\r\nthe place, wherein it is limited and circumscribed? For the whole earth\r\nis but as one point; and of it, this inhabited part of it, is but a very\r\nlittle part; and of this part, how many in number, and what manner of\r\nmen are they, that will commend thee? What remains then, but that thou\r\noften put in practice this kind of retiring of thyself, to this little\r\npart of thyself; and above all things, keep thyself from distraction,\r\nand intend not anything vehemently, but be free and consider all things,\r\nas a man whose proper object is Virtue, as a man whose true nature is\r\nto be kind and sociable, as a citizen, as a mortal creature. Among\r\nother things, which to consider, and look into thou must use to withdraw\r\nthyself, let those two be among the most obvious and at hand. One, that\r\nthe things or objects themselves reach not unto the soul, but stand\r\nwithout still and quiet, and that it is from the opinion only which is\r\nwithin, that all the tumult and all the trouble doth proceed. The next,\r\nthat all these things, which now thou seest, shall within a very little\r\nwhile be changed, and be no more: and ever call to mind, how many\r\nchanges and alterations in the world thou thyself hast already been an\r\neyewitness of in thy time. This world is mere change, and this life,\r\nopinion."

Thou must be like a promontory of the sea, against which though\r\nthe waves beat continually, yet it both itself stands, and about it are\r\nthose swelling waves stilled and quieted.\r\n\r\nXLI. Oh, wretched I, to whom this mischance is happened! nay, happy I,\r\nto whom this thing being happened, I can continue without grief; neither\r\nwounded by that which is present, nor in fear of that which is to come.\r\nFor as for this, it might have happened unto any man, but any man having\r\nsuch a thing befallen him, could not have continued without grief. Why\r\nthen should that rather be an unhappiness, than this a happiness? But\r\nhowever, canst thou, O man! term that unhappiness, which is no mischance\r\nto the nature of man I Canst thou think that a mischance to the nature\r\nof man, which is not contrary to the end and will of his nature? What\r\nthen hast thou learned is the will of man's nature? Doth that then which\r\nhath happened unto thee, hinder thee from being just? or magnanimous? or\r\ntemperate? or wise? or circumspect? or true? or modest? or free? or from\r\nanything else of all those things in the present enjoying and possession\r\nwhereof the nature of man, (as then enjoying all that is proper unto\r\nher,) is fully satisfied? Now to conclude; upon all occasion of sorrow\r\nremember henceforth to make use of this dogma, that whatsoever it is\r\nthat hath happened unto thee, is in very deed no such thing of itself,\r\nas a misfortune; but that to bear it generously, is certainly great\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nXLII. It is but an ordinary coarse one, yet it is a good effectual\r\nremedy against the fear of death, for a man to consider in his mind the\r\nexamples of such, who greedily and covetously (as it were) did for a\r\nlong time enjoy their lives. What have they got more, than they whose\r\ndeaths have been untimely? Are not they themselves dead at the last?\r\nas Cadiciant's, Fabius, Julianus Lepidus, or any other who in their\r\nlifetime having buried many, were at the last buried themselves. The\r\nwhole space of any man's life, is but little; and as little as it is,\r\nwith what troubles, with what manner of dispositions, and in the society\r\nof how wretched a body must it be passed! Let it be therefore unto thee\r\naltogether as a matter of indifferency. For if thou shalt look backward;\r\nbehold, what an infinite chaos of time doth present itself unto thee;\r\nand as infinite a chaos, if thou shalt look forward. In that which is\r\nso infinite, what difference can there be between that which liveth but\r\nthree days, and that which liveth three ages?\r\n\r\nXLIII. Let thy course ever be the most compendious way. The most\r\ncompendious, is that which is according to nature: that is, in all both\r\nwords and deeds, ever to follow that which is most sound and perfect.\r\nFor such a resolution will free a man from all trouble, strife,\r\ndissembling, and ostentation.\r\n\nTHE FIFTH BOOK"

And as the whole world is made up of all the\r\nparticular bodies of the world, one perfect and complete body, of the\r\nsame nature that particular bodies; so is the destiny of particular\r\ncauses and events one general one, of the same nature that particular\r\ncauses are. What I now say, even they that are mere idiots are not\r\nignorant of: for they say commonly τοῦτο ἔφερεν ἀυτῷ, that is, This\r\nhis destiny hath brought upon him. This therefore is by the fates\r\nproperly and particularly brought upon this, as that unto this in\r\nparticular is by the physician prescribed.

For these two considerations then\r\nthou must be well pleased with anything that doth happen unto thee.\r\nFirst, because that for thee properly it was brought to pass, and unto\r\nthee it was prescribed; and that from the very beginning by the series\r\nand connection of the first causes, it hath ever had a reference unto\r\nthee. And secondly, because the good success and perfect welfare, and\r\nindeed the very continuance of Him, that is the Administrator of the\r\nwhole, doth in a manner depend on it. For the whole (because whole,\r\ntherefore entire and perfect) is maimed, and mutilated, if thou shalt\r\ncut off anything at all, whereby the coherence, and contiguity as of\r\nparts, so of causes, is maintained and preserved. Of which certain it\r\nis, that thou doest (as much as lieth in thee) cut off, and in some\r\nsort violently take somewhat away, as often as thou art displeased with\r\nanything that happeneth."

Think not\r\nof these therefore, as things contrary to those which thou dost much\r\nhonour, and respect; but consider in thy mind the true fountain of all.\r\n\r\nXXXIV He that seeth the things that are now, hath Seen all that either\r\nwas ever, or ever shall be, for all things are of one kind; and all like\r\none unto another. Meditate often upon the connection of all things in\r\nthe world; and upon the mutual relation that they have one unto another.\r\nFor all things are after a sort folded and involved one within another,\r\nand by these means all agree well together. For one thing is consequent\r\nunto another, by local motion, by natural conspiration and agreement,\r\nand by substantial union, or, reduction of all substances into one."

But if so be that they have not\r\ndeliberated of me in particular, certainly they have of the whole in\r\ngeneral, and those things which in consequence and coherence of this\r\ngeneral deliberation happen unto me in particular, I am bound to embrace\r\nand accept of.

And my nature is, to be rational in all my\r\nactions and as a good, and natural member of a city and commonwealth,\r\ntowards my fellow members ever to be sociably and kindly disposed and\r\naffected. My city and country as I am Antoninus, is Rome; as a man, the\r\nwhole world. Those things therefore that are expedient and profitable to\r\nthose cities, are the only things that are good and expedient for me.\r\n\r\nXL. Whatsoever in any kind doth happen to any one, is expedient to the\r\nwhole. And thus much to content us might suffice, that it is expedient\r\nfor the whole in general. But yet this also shalt thou generally\r\nperceive, if thou dost diligently take heed, that whatsoever doth happen\r\nto any one man or men.... And now I am content that the word expedient,\r\nshould more generally be understood of those things which we otherwise\r\ncall middle things, or things indifferent; as health, wealth, and the\r\nlike.\r\n\r\nXLI. As the ordinary shows of the theatre and of other such places,\r\nwhen thou art presented with them, affect thee; as the same things still\r\nseen, and in the same fashion, make the sight ingrateful and tedious;\r\nso must all the things that we see all our life long affect us. For all\r\nthings, above and below, are still the same, and from the same causes.\r\nWhen then will there be an end?\r\n\r\nXLII. Let the several deaths of men of all sorts, and of all sorts of\r\nprofessions, and of all sort of nations, be a perpetual object of thy\r\nthoughts,... so that thou mayst even come down to Philistio, Phœbus,\r\nand Origanion. Pass now to other generations. Thither shall we after\r\nmany changes, where so many brave orators are; where so many grave\r\nphilosophers; Heraclitus, Pythagoras, Socrates. Where so many heroes of\r\nthe old times; and then so many brave captains of the latter times; and\r\nso many kings. After all these, where Eudoxus, Hipparchus, Archimedes;\r\nwhere so many other sharp, generous, industrious, subtile, peremptory\r\ndispositions; and among others, even they, that have been the greatest\r\nscoffers and deriders of the frailty and brevity of this our human life;\r\nas Menippus, and others, as many as there have been such as he. Of all\r\nthese consider, that they long since are all dead, and gone. And what do\r\nthey suffer by it! Nay they that have not so much as a name remaining,\r\nwhat are they the worse for it? One thing there is, and that only, which\r\nis worth our while in this world, and ought by us much to be esteemed;\r\nand that is, according to truth and righteousness, meekly and lovingly\r\nto converse with false, and unrighteous men.\r\n\r\nXLIII. When thou wilt comfort and cheer thyself, call to mind the\r\nseveral gifts and virtues of them, whom thou dost daily converse with;\r\nas for example, the industry of the one; the modesty of another; the\r\nliberality of a third; of another some other thing. For nothing can so\r\nmuch rejoice thee, as the resemblances and parallels of several virtues,\r\nvisible and eminent in the dispositions of those who live with thee;\r\nespecially when, all at once, as near as may be, they represent\r\nthemselves unto thee. And therefore thou must have them always in a\r\nreadiness.\r\n\r\nXLIV. Dost thou grieve that thou dost weigh but so many pounds, and not\r\nthree hundred rather? Just as much reason hast thou to grieve that\r\nthou must live but so many years, and not longer. For as for bulk and\r\nsubstance thou dost content thyself with that proportion of it that is\r\nallotted unto thee, so shouldst thou for time.\r\n\r\nXLV. Let us do our best endeavours to persuade them; but however, if\r\nreason and justice lead thee to it, do it, though they be never so much\r\nagainst it. But if any shall by force withstand thee, and hinder thee in\r\nit, convert thy virtuous inclination from one object unto another, from\r\njustice to contented equanimity, and cheerful patience: so that what in\r\nthe one is thy hindrance, thou mayst make use of it for the exercise of\r\nanother virtue: and remember that it was with due exception, and\r\nreservation, that thou didst at first incline and desire. For thou didst\r\nnot set thy mind upon things impossible. Upon what then? that all thy\r\ndesires might ever be moderated with this due kind of reservation. And\r\nthis thou hast, and mayst always obtain, whether the thing desired be in\r\nthy power or no. And what do I care for more, if that for which I was\r\nborn and brought forth into the world (to rule all my desires with\r\nreason and discretion) may be?\r\n\r\nXLVI. The ambitious supposeth another man's act, praise and applause, to\r\nbe his own happiness; the voluptuous his own sense and feeling; but he\r\nthat is wise, his own action.\r\n\r\nXLVII. It is in thy power absolutely to exclude all manner of conceit\r\nand opinion, as concerning this matter; and by the same means, to\r\nexclude all grief and sorrow from thy soul. For as for the things and\r\nobjects themselves, they of themselves have no such power, whereby to\r\nbeget and force upon us any opinion at all.\r\n\r\nXLVIII. Use thyself when any man speaks unto thee, so to hearken unto\r\nhim, as that in the interim thou give not way to any other thoughts;\r\nthat so thou mayst (as far as is possible) seem fixed and fastened to\r\nhis very soul, whosoever he be that speaks unto thee.\r\n\r\nXLIX. That which is not good for the bee-hive, cannot be good for the\r\nbee.\r\n\r\nL. Will either passengers, or patients, find fault and complain, either\r\nthe one if they be well carried, or the others if well cured? Do they\r\ntake care for any more than this; the one, that their shipmaster may\r\nbring them safe to land, and the other, that their physician may effect\r\ntheir recovery?\r\n\r\nLI. How many of them who came into the world at the same time when I\r\ndid, are already gone out of it?\r\n\r\nLII. To them that are sick of the jaundice, honey seems bitter; and to\r\nthem that are bitten by a mad dog, the water terrible; and to children,\r\na little ball seems a fine thing. And why then should I be angry? or\r\ndo I think that error and false opinion is less powerful to make men\r\ntransgress, than either choler, being immoderate and excessive, to cause\r\nthe jaundice; or poison, to cause rage?\r\n\r\nLIII.

Now since that time, whatsoever it is, that\r\nis and happens in the world, is either but a consequent of that one and\r\nfirst deliberation: or if so be that this ruling rational part of the\r\nworld, takes any thought and care of things particular, they are surely\r\nhis reasonable and principal creatures, that are the proper object of\r\nhis particular care and providence.

For in those things that\r\nproperly belong unto the mind, she cannot be hindered by any man. It\r\nis not fire, nor iron; nor the power of a tyrant nor the power of a\r\nslandering tongue; nor anything else that can penetrate into her.\r\n\r\nXL. If once round and solid, there is no fear that ever it will change.\r\n\r\nXLI. Why should I grieve myself; who never did willingly grieve any\r\nother! One thing rejoices one and another thing another. As for me, this\r\nis my joy, if my understanding be right and sound, as neither averse\r\nfrom any man, nor refusing any of those things which as a man I am\r\nsubject unto; if I can look upon all things in the world meekly and\r\nkindly; accept all things and carry myself towards everything according\r\nto to true worth of the thing itself.\r\n\r\nXLII. This time that is now present, bestow thou upon thyself. They that\r\nrather hunt for fame after death, do not consider, that those men that\r\nshall be hereafter, will be even such, as these whom now they can so\r\nhardly bear with. And besides they also will be mortal men. But to\r\nconsider the thing in itself, if so many with so many voices, shall make\r\nsuch and such a sound, or shall have such and such an opinion concerning\r\nthee, what is it to thee?\r\n\r\nXLIII. Take me and throw me where thou wilt: I am indifferent. For there\r\nalso I shall have that spirit which is within me propitious; that is\r\nwell pleased and fully contented both in that constant disposition, and\r\nwith those particular actions, which to its own proper constitution are\r\nsuitable and agreeable.\r\n\r\nXLIV. Is this then a thing of that worth, that for it my soul should\r\nsuffer, and become worse than it was? as either basely dejected, or\r\ndisordinately affected, or confounded within itself, or terrified? What\r\ncan there be, that thou shouldest so much esteem?\r\n\r\nXLV. Nothing can happen unto thee, which is not incidental unto thee, as\r\nthou art a man. As nothing can happen either to an ox, a vine, or to\r\na stone, which is not incidental unto them; unto every one in his own\r\nkind. If therefore nothing can happen unto anything, which is not both\r\nusual and natural; why art thou displeased? Sure the common nature\r\nof all would not bring anything upon any, that were intolerable. If\r\ntherefore it be a thing external that causes thy grief, know, that it is\r\nnot that properly that doth cause it, but thine own conceit and opinion\r\nconcerning the thing: which thou mayest rid thyself of, when thou wilt.\r\nBut if it be somewhat that is amiss in thine own disposition, that doth\r\ngrieve thee, mayest thou not rectify thy moral tenets and opinions. But\r\nif it grieve thee, that thou doest not perform that which seemeth unto\r\nthee right and just, why doest not thou choose rather to perform it than\r\nto grieve? But somewhat that is stronger than thyself doth hinder thee.\r\nLet it not grieve thee then, if it be not thy fault that the thing is\r\nnot performed. 'Yea but it is a thing of that nature, as that thy life\r\nis not worth the while, except it may be performed.' If it be so, upon\r\ncondition that thou be kindly and lovingly disposed towards all men,\r\nthou mayest be gone. For even then, as much as at any time, art thou in\r\na very good estate of performance, when thou doest die in charity with\r\nthose, that are an obstacle unto thy performance.\r\n\r\nXLVI. Remember that thy mind is of that nature as that it becometh\r\naltogether unconquerable, when once recollected in herself, she seeks no\r\nother content than this, that she cannot be forced: yea though it so\r\nfall out, that it be even against reason itself, that it cloth bandy.\r\nHow much less when by the help of reason she is able to judge of things\r\nwith discretion? And therefore let thy chief fort and place of defence\r\nbe, a mind free from passions. A stronger place, (whereunto to make his\r\nrefuge, and so to become impregnable) and better fortified than this,\r\nhath no man. He that seeth not this is unlearned. He that seeth it, and\r\nbetaketh not himself to this place of refuge, is unhappy.\r\n\r\nXLVII. Keep thyself to the first bare and naked apprehensions of things,\r\nas they present themselves unto thee, and add not unto them. It is\r\nreported unto thee, that such a one speaketh ill of thee. Well; that he\r\nspeaketh ill of thee, so much is reported. But that thou art hurt\r\nthereby, is not reported: that is the addition of opinion, which thou\r\nmust exclude. I see that my child is sick. That he is sick, I see, but\r\nthat he is in danger of his life also, I see it not. Thus thou must use\r\nto keep thyself to the first motions and apprehensions of things, as\r\nthey present themselves outwardly; and add not unto them from within\r\nthyself through mere conceit and opinion. Or rather add unto them: hut\r\nas one that understandeth the true nature of all things that happen in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nXLVIII. Is the cucumber bitter? set it away. Brambles are in the way?\r\navoid them. Let this suffice. Add not presently speaking unto thyself,\r\nWhat serve these things for in the world? For, this, one that is\r\nacquainted with the mysteries of nature, will laugh at thee for it; as a\r\ncarpenter would or a shoemaker, if meeting in either of their shops with\r\nsome shavings, or small remnants of their work, thou shouldest blame\r\nthem for it. And yet those men, it is not for want of a place where to\r\nthrow them that they keep them in their shops for a while: but the\r\nnature of the universe hath no such out-place; but herein doth consist\r\nthe wonder of her art and skill, that she having once circumscribed\r\nherself within some certain bounds and limits, whatsoever is within her\r\nthat seems either corrupted, or old, or unprofitable, she can change it\r\ninto herself, and of these very things can make new things; so that she\r\nneedeth not to seek elsewhere out of herself either for a new supply of\r\nmatter and substance, or for a place where to throw out whatsoever is\r\nirrecoverably putrid and corrupt. Thus she, as for place, so for matter\r\nand art, is herself sufficient unto herself.\r\n\r\nXLIX. Not to be slack and negligent; or loose, and wanton in thy\r\nactions; nor contentious, and troublesome in thy conversation; nor to\r\nrove and wander in thy fancies and imaginations. Not basely to contract\r\nthy soul; nor boisterously to sally out with it, or furiously to launch\r\nout as it were, nor ever to want employment.\r\n\r\nL. 'They kill me, they cut my flesh; they persecute my person with\r\ncurses.' What then? May not thy mind for all this continue pure,\r\nprudent, temperate, just? As a fountain of sweet and clear water, though\r\nshe be cursed by some stander by, yet do her springs nevertheless still\r\nrun as sweet and clear as before; yea though either dirt or dung be\r\nthrown in, yet is it no sooner thrown, than dispersed, and she cleared.\r\nShe cannot be dyed or infected by it. What then must I do, that I\r\nmay have within myself an overflowing fountain, and not a well? Beget\r\nthyself by continual pains and endeavours to true liberty with charity,\r\nand true simplicity and modesty.\r\n\r\nLI. He that knoweth not what the world is, knoweth not where he himself\r\nis. And he that knoweth not what the world was made for, cannot possibly\r\nknow either what are the qualities, or what is the nature of the world.\r\nNow he that in either of these is to seek, for what he himself was made\r\nis ignorant also. What then dost thou think of that man, who proposeth\r\nunto himself, as a matter of great moment, the noise and applause\r\nof men, who both where they are, and what they are themselves, are\r\naltogether ignorant? Dost thou desire to be commended of that man, who\r\nthrice in one hour perchance, doth himself curse himself? Dost thou\r\ndesire to please him, who pleaseth not himself? or dost thou think that\r\nhe pleaseth himself, who doth use to repent himself almost of everything\r\nthat he doth?\r\n\r\nLII. Not only now henceforth to have a common breath, or to hold\r\ncorrespondency of breath, with that air, that compasseth us about; but\r\nto have a common mind, or to hold correspondency of mind also with that\r\nrational substance, which compasseth all things. For, that also is of\r\nitself, and of its own nature (if a man can but draw it in as he should)\r\neverywhere diffused; and passeth through all things, no less than the\r\nair doth, if a man can but suck it in.\r\n\r\nLIII. Wickedness in general doth not hurt the world. Particular\r\nwickedness doth not hurt any other: only unto him it is hurtful,\r\nwhosoever he be that offends, unto whom in great favour and mercy it is\r\ngranted, that whensoever he himself shall but first desire it, he may be\r\npresently delivered of it. Unto my free-will my neighbour's free-will,\r\nwhoever he be, (as his life, or his bode), is altogether indifferent.\r\nFor though we are all made one for another, yet have our minds and\r\nunderstandings each of them their own proper and limited jurisdiction.\r\nFor else another man's wickedness might be my evil which God would not\r\nhave, that it might not be in another man's power to make me unhappy:\r\nwhich nothing now can do but mine own wickedness.\r\n\r\nLIV. The sun seemeth to be shed abroad. And indeed it is diffused but\r\nnot effused. For that diffusion of it is a τάσις or an extension. For\r\ntherefore are the beams of it called ἀκτῖνες from the word ἐκτείνεσθαι\r\nto be stretched out and extended. Now what a sunbeam is, thou mayest\r\nknow if thou observe the light of the sun, when through some narrow\r\nhole it pierceth into some room that is dark. For it is always in a\r\ndirect line. And as by any solid body, that it meets with in the way\r\nthat is not penetrable by air, it is divided and abrupted, and yet\r\nneither slides off, or falls down, but stayeth there nevertheless: such\r\nmust the diffusion in the mind be; not an effusion, but an extension.\r\nWhat obstacles and impediments soever she meeteth within her way, she\r\nmust not violently, and by way of an impetuous onset light upon them;\r\nneither must she fall down; but she must stand, and give light unto\r\nthat which doth admit of it. For as for that which doth not, it is its\r\nown fault and loss, if it bereave itself of her light.\r\n\r\nLV. He that feareth death, either feareth that he shall have no sense at\r\nall, or that his senses will not be the same. Whereas, he should rather\r\ncomfort himself, that either no sense at all, and so no sense of evil;\r\nor if any sense, then another life, and so no death properly.\r\n\r\nLVI. All men are made one for another: either then teach them better, or\r\nbear with them.\r\n\r\nLVII. The motion of the mind is not as the motion of a dart. For\r\nthe mind when it is wary and cautelous, and by way of diligent\r\ncircumspection turneth herself many ways, may then as well be said to\r\ngo straight on to the object, as when it useth no such circumspection.\r\n\nLVIII. To pierce and penetrate into the estate of every one's\r\nunderstanding that thou hast to do with: as also to make the estate of\r\nthine own open, and penetrable to any other.\r\n\nTHE NINTH BOOK"

      "content": "having made all reasonable creatures one for another, to the end that\r\nthey should do one another good; more or less according to the several\r\npersons and occasions but in nowise hurt one another: it is manifest\r\nthat he that doth transgress against this her will, is guilty of impiety\r\ntowards the most ancient and venerable of all the deities. For the\r\nnature of the universe, is the nature the common parent of all, and\r\ntherefore piously to be observed of all things that are, and that which\r\nnow is, to whatsoever first was, and gave it its being, hath relation\r\nof blood and kindred. She is also called truth and is the first cause\r\nof all truths. He therefore that willingly and wittingly doth lie, is\r\nimpious in that he doth receive, and so commit injustice: but he that\r\nagainst his will, in that he disagreeth from the nature of the universe,\r\nand in that striving with the nature of the world he doth in his\r\nparticular, violate the general order of the world. For he doth no\r\nbetter than strive and war against it, who contrary to his own nature\r\napplieth himself to that which is contrary to truth. For nature had\r\nbefore furnished him with instincts and opportunities sufficient for the\r\nattainment of it; which he having hitherto neglected, is not now able\r\nto discern that which is false from that which is true. He also that\r\npursues after pleasures, as that which is truly good and flies from\r\npains, as that which is truly evil: is impious. For such a one must of\r\nnecessity oftentimes accuse that common nature, as distributing many\r\nthings both unto the evil, and unto the good, not according to the\r\ndeserts of either: as unto the bad oftentimes pleasures, and the causes\r\nof pleasures; so unto the good, pains, and the occasions of pains.\r\nAgain, he that feareth pains and crosses in this world, feareth some of\r\nthose things which some time or other must needs happen in the world.\r\nAnd that we have already showed to be impious. And he that pursueth\r\nafter pleasures, will not spare, to compass his desires, to do that\r\nwhich is unjust, and that is manifestly impious. Now those things which\r\nunto nature are equally indifferent (for she had not created both, both\r\npain and pleasure, if both had not been unto her equally indifferent):\r\nthey that will live according to nature, must in those things (as being\r\nof the same mind and disposition that she is) be as equally indifferent.\r\nWhosoever therefore in either matter of pleasure and pain; death and\r\nlife; honour and dishonour, (which things nature in the administration\r\nof the world, indifferently doth make use of), is not as indifferent,\r\nit is apparent that he is impious. When I say that common nature\r\ndoth indifferently make use of them, my meaning is, that they happen\r\nindifferently in the ordinary course of things, which by a necessary\r\nconsequence, whether as principal or accessory, come to pass in the\r\nworld, according to that first and ancient deliberation of Providence,\r\nby which she from some certain beginning, did resolve upon the creation\r\nof such a world, conceiving then in her womb as it were some certain\r\nrational generative seeds and faculties of things future, whether\r\nsubjects, changes, successions; both such and such, and just so many."

As of all earthly things there is but one earth, and but one\r\nlight that we see by; and but one air that we breathe in, as many as\r\neither breathe or see. Now whatsoever partakes of some common thing,\r\nnaturally affects and inclines unto that whereof it is part, being of\r\none kind and nature with it. Whatsoever is earthly, presseth downwards\r\nto the common earth. Whatsoever is liquid, would flow together. And\r\nwhatsoever is airy, would be together likewise. So that without some\r\nobstacle, and some kind of violence, they cannot well be kept asunder.\r\nWhatsoever is fiery, doth not only by reason of the elementary fire tend\r\nupwards; but here also is so ready to join, and to burn together, that\r\nwhatsoever doth want sufficient moisture to make resistance, is easily\r\nset on fire. Whatsoever therefore is partaker of that reasonable common\r\nnature, naturally doth as much and more long after his own kind. For by\r\nhow much in its own nature it excels all other things, by so much more\r\nis it desirous to be joined and united unto that, which is of its own\r\nnature. As for unreasonable creatures then, they had not long been, but\r\npresently begun among them swarms, and flocks, and broods of young ones,\r\nand a kind of mutual love and affection. For though but unreasonable,\r\nyet a kind of soul these had, and therefore was that natural desire of\r\nunion more strong and intense in them, as in creatures of a more\r\nexcellent nature, than either in plants, or stones, or trees. But among\r\nreasonable creatures, begun commonwealths, friendships, families, public\r\nmeetings, and even in their wars, conventions, and truces. Now among\r\nthem that were yet of a more excellent nature, as the stars and planets,\r\nthough by their nature far distant one from another, yet even among them\r\nbegan some mutual correspondency and unity. So proper is it to\r\nexcellency in a high degree to affect unity, as that even in things so\r\nfar distant, it could operate unto a mutual sympathy. But now behold,\r\nwhat is now come to pass. Those creatures that are reasonable, are now\r\nthe only creatures that have forgotten their natural affection and\r\ninclination of one towards another. Among them alone of all other things\r\nthat are of one kind, there is not to be found a general disposition to\r\nflow together. But though they fly from nature, yet are they stopt in\r\ntheir course, and apprehended. Do they what they can, nature doth\r\nprevail. And so shalt thou confess, if thou dost observe it. For sooner\r\nmayst thou find a thing earthly, where no earthly thing is, than find a\r\nman that naturally can live by himself alone."

'In my sickness' (saith Epicurus of himself:) 'my discourses were\r\nnot concerning the nature of my disease, neither was that, to them that\r\ncame to visit me, the subject of my talk; but in the consideration and\r\ncontemplation of that, which was of especial weight and moment, was all\r\nmy time bestowed and spent, and among others in this very thing, how my\r\nmind, by a natural and unavoidable sympathy partaking in some sort with\r\nthe present indisposition of my body, might nevertheless keep herself\r\nfree from trouble, and in present possession of her own proper\r\nhappiness. Neither did I leave the ordering of my body to the physicians\r\naltogether to do with me what they would, as though I expected any\r\ngreat matter from them, or as though I thought it a matter of such great\r\nconsequence, by their means to recover my health: for my present estate,\r\nmethought, liked me very well, and gave me good content.' Whether\r\ntherefore in sickness (if thou chance to sicken) or in what other kind\r\nof extremity soever, endeavour thou also to be in thy mind so affected,\r\nas he doth report of himself: not to depart from thy philosophy for\r\nanything that can befall thee, nor to give ear to the discourses of\r\nsilly people, and mere naturalists.\r\n\r\nXLII. It is common to all trades and professions to mind and intend that\r\nonly, which now they are about, and the instrument whereby they work.\r\n\r\nXLIII. When at any time thou art offended with any one's impudency, put\r\npresently this question to thyself: 'What? Is it then possible, that\r\nthere should not be any impudent men in the world! Certainly it is not\r\npossible.' Desire not then that which is impossible. For this one, (thou\r\nmust think) whosoever he be, is one of those impudent ones, that\r\nthe world cannot be without. So of the subtile and crafty, so of the\r\nperfidious, so of every one that offendeth, must thou ever be ready to\r\nreason with thyself. For whilst in general thou dost thus reason with\r\nthyself, that the kind of them must needs be in the world, thou wilt be\r\nthe better able to use meekness towards every particular. This also\r\nthou shalt find of very good use, upon every such occasion, presently\r\nto consider with thyself, what proper virtue nature hath furnished man\r\nwith, against such a vice, or to encounter with a disposition vicious\r\nin this kind. As for example, against the unthankful, it hath given\r\ngoodness and meekness, as an antidote, and so against another vicious\r\nin another kind some other peculiar faculty. And generally, is it not\r\nin thy power to instruct him better, that is in an error? For whosoever\r\nsinneth, doth in that decline from his purposed end, and is certainly\r\ndeceived, And again, what art thou the worse for his sin? For thou shalt\r\nnot find that any one of these, against whom thou art incensed, hath in\r\nvery deed done anything whereby thy mind (the only true subject of\r\nthy hurt and evil) can be made worse than it was. And what a matter of\r\neither grief or wonder is this, if he that is unlearned, do the deeds of\r\none that is unlearned? Should not thou rather blame thyself, who, when\r\nupon very good grounds of reason, thou mightst have thought it very\r\nprobable, that such a thing would by such a one be committed, didst not\r\nonly not foresee it, but moreover dost wonder at it, that such a thing\r\nshould be. But then especially, when thou dost find fault with either an\r\nunthankful, or a false man, must thou reflect upon thyself. For without\r\nall question, thou thyself art much in fault, if either of one that were\r\nof such a disposition, thou didst expect that he should be true unto\r\nthee: or when unto any thou didst a good turn, thou didst not there\r\nbound thy thoughts, as one that had obtained his end; nor didst not\r\nthink that from the action itself thou hadst received a full reward of\r\nthe good that thou hadst done. For what wouldst thou have more? Unto him\r\nthat is a man, thou hast done a good turn: doth not that suffice thee?\r\nWhat thy nature required, that hast thou done. Must thou be rewarded for\r\nit? As if either the eye for that it seeth, or the feet that they go,\r\nshould require satisfaction. For as these being by nature appointed for\r\nsuch an use, can challenge no more, than that they may work according\r\nto their natural constitution: so man being born to do good unto others\r\nwhensoever he doth a real good unto any by helping them out of error; or\r\nthough but in middle things, as in matter of wealth, life, preferment,\r\nand the like, doth help to further their desires he doth that for which\r\nhe was made, and therefore can require no more.\r\n\nTHE TENTH BOOK"

Now say I, if so be that this be both hurtful\r\nunto them, and yet unavoidable, would not, thinkest thou, the whole\r\nitself be in a sweet case, all the parts of it being subject to\r\nalteration, yea and by their making itself fitted for corruption, as\r\nconsisting of things different and contrary? And did nature then either\r\nof herself thus project and purpose the affliction and misery of her\r\nparts, and therefore of purpose so made them, not only that haply they\r\nmight, but of necessity that they should fall into evil; or did not she\r\nknow what she did, when she made them? For either of these two to say,\r\nis equally absurd. But to let pass nature in general, and to reason of\r\nthings particular according to their own particular natures; how absurd\r\nand ridiculous is it, first to say that all parts of the whole are, by\r\ntheir proper natural constitution, subject to alteration; and then when\r\nany such thing doth happen, as when one doth fall sick and dieth, to\r\ntake on and wonder as though some strange thing had happened? Though\r\nthis besides might move not so grievously to take on when any such thing\r\ndoth happen, that whatsoever is dissolved, it is dissolved into those\r\nthings, whereof it was compounded. For every dissolution is either\r\na mere dispersion, of the elements into those elements again whereof\r\neverything did consist, or a change, of that which is more solid into\r\nearth; and of that which is pure and subtile or spiritual, into air.\r\nSo that by this means nothing is lost, but all resumed again into those\r\nrational generative seeds of the universe; and this universe, either\r\nafter a certain period of time to lie consumed by fire, or by continual\r\nchanges to be renewed, and so for ever to endure. Now that solid and\r\nspiritual that we speak of, thou must not conceive it to be that very\r\nsame, which at first was, when thou wert born. For alas! all this that\r\nnow thou art in either kind, either for matter of substance, or of life,\r\nhath but two or three days ago partly from meats eaten, and partly from\r\nair breathed in, received all its influx, being the same then in no\r\nother respect, than a running river, maintained by the perpetual influx\r\nand new supply of waters, is the same. That therefore which thou hast\r\nsince received, not that which came from thy mother, is that which\r\ncomes to change and corruption. But suppose that that for the general\r\nsubstance, and more solid part of it, should still cleave unto thee\r\nnever so close, yet what is that to the proper qualities and affections\r\nof it, by which persons are distinguished, which certainly are quite\r\ndifferent?"

Now for the better remembrance of\r\nthose names that we have spoken of, thou shalt find it a very good\r\nhelp, to remember the Gods as often as may be: and that, the thing\r\nwhich they require at our hands of as many of us, as are by nature\r\nreasonable creation is not that with fair words, and outward show of\r\npiety and devotion we should flatter them, but that we should become\r\nlike unto them: and that as all other natural creatures, the fig tree\r\nfor example; the dog the bee: both do, all of them, and apply\r\nthemselves unto that which by their natural constitution, is proper\r\nunto them; so man likewise should do that, which by his nature, as he\r\nis a man, belongs unto him."

For thou must account that pleasure, whatsoever it be, that thou\r\nmayest do according to thine own nature. And to do this, every place\r\nwill fit thee. Unto the _cylindrus_, or roller, it is not granted to\r\nmove everywhere according to its own proper motion, as neither unto\r\nthe water, nor unto the fire, nor unto any other thing, that either is\r\nmerely natural, or natural and sensitive; but not rational for many\r\nthings there be that can hinder their operations.

For all other kind of hindrances that are not hindrances of thy\r\nmind either they are proper to the body, or merely proceed from the\r\nopinion, reason not making that resistance that it should, but basely,\r\nand cowardly suffering itself to be foiled; and of themselves can\r\nneither wound, nor do any hurt at all. Else must he of necessity,\r\nwhosoever he be that meets with any of them, become worse than he was\r\nbefore. For so is it in all other subjects, that that is thought hurtful\r\nunto them, whereby they are made worse. But here contrariwise, man (if\r\nhe make that good use of them that he should) is rather the better\r\nand the more praiseworthy for any of those kind of hindrances, than\r\notherwise. But generally remember that nothing can hurt a natural\r\ncitizen, that is not hurtful unto the city itself, nor anything hurt\r\nthe city, that is not hurtful unto the law itself. But none of these\r\ncasualties, or external hindrances, do hurt the law itself; or, are\r\ncontrary to that course of justice and equity, by which public societies\r\nare maintained: neither therefore do they hurt either city or citizen."

Therefore are they\r\ngrieved, whensoever they hear themselves charged, either of injustice,\r\nor unconscionableness, or covetousness, or in general, of any injurious\r\nkind of dealing towards their neighbours. Fourthly, that thou thyself\r\ndoest transgress in many things, and art even such another as they are.\r\nAnd though perchance thou doest forbear the very act of some sins, yet\r\nhast thou in thyself an habitual disposition to them, but that either\r\nthrough fear, or vainglory, or some such other ambitious foolish\r\nrespect, thou art restrained. Fifthly, that whether they have sinned or\r\nno, thou doest not understand perfectly. For many things are done by\r\nway of discreet policy; and generally a man must know many things\r\nfirst, before he be able truly and judiciously to judge of another\r\nman's action. Sixthly, that whensoever thou doest take on grievously, or\r\nmakest great woe, little doest thou remember then that a man's life is\r\nbut for a moment of time, and that within a while we shall all be in our\r\ngraves. Seventhly, that it is not the sins and transgressions themselves\r\nthat trouble us properly; for they have their existence in their\r\nminds and understandings only, that commit them; but our own opinions\r\nconcerning those sins. Remove then, and be content to part with that\r\nconceit of thine, that it is a grievous thing, and thou hast removed\r\nthine anger. But how should I remove it? How? reasoning with thyself\r\nthat it is not shameful. For if that which is shameful, be not the only\r\ntrue evil that is, thou also wilt be driven whilest thou doest follow\r\nthe common instinct of nature, to avoid that which is evil, to commit\r\nmany unjust things, and to become a thief, and anything, that will\r\nmake to the attainment of thy intended worldly ends. Eighthly, how many\r\nthings may and do oftentimes follow upon such fits of anger and grief;\r\nfar more grievous in themselves, than those very things which we are so\r\ngrieved or angry for. Ninthly, that meekness is a thing unconquerable,\r\nif it be true and natural, and not affected or hypocritical. For how\r\nshall even the most fierce and malicious that thou shalt conceive, be\r\nable to hold on against thee, if thou shalt still continue meek and\r\nloving unto him; and that even at that time, when he is about to do\r\nthee wrong, thou shalt be well disposed, and in good temper, with all\r\nmeekness to teach him, and to instruct him better? As for example; My\r\nson, we were not born for this, to hurt and annoy one another; it will\r\nbe thy hurt not mine, my son: and so to show him forcibly and fully,\r\nthat it is so in very deed: and that neither bees do it one to another,\r\nnor any other creatures that are naturally sociable. But this thou must\r\ndo, not scoffingly, not by way of exprobation, but tenderly without\r\nany harshness of words. Neither must thou do it by way of exercise, or\r\nostentation, that they that are by and hear thee, may admire thee: but\r\nso always that nobody be privy to it, but himself alone: yea, though\r\nthere be more present at the same time. These nine particular heads, as\r\nso many gifts from the Muses, see that thou remember well: and begin one\r\nday, whilest thou art yet alive, to be a man indeed. But on the other\r\nside thou must take heed, as much to flatter them, as to be angry with\r\nthem: for both are equally uncharitable, and equally hurtful. And in thy\r\npassions, take it presently to thy consideration, that to be angry is\r\nnot the part of a man, but that to be meek and gentle, as it savours of\r\nmore humanity, so of more manhood. That in this, there is strength\r\nand nerves, or vigour and fortitude: whereof anger and indignation is\r\naltogether void. For the nearer everything is unto unpassionateness,\r\nthe nearer it is unto power. And as grief doth proceed from weakness,\r\nso doth anger. For both, both he that is angry and that grieveth, have\r\nreceived a wound, and cowardly have as it were yielded themselves unto\r\ntheir affections. If thou wilt have a tenth also, receive this tenth\r\ngift from Hercules the guide and leader of the Muses: that is a mad\r\nman's part, to look that there should be no wicked men in the world,\r\nbecause it is impossible. Now for a man to brook well enough, that there\r\nshould be wicked men in the world, but not to endure that any\r\nshould transgress against himself, is against all equity, and indeed\r\ntyrannical."

CORNELIUS FRONTO[1]\r\n\r\nM. CORNELIUS FRONTO was a Roman by descent, but of provincial birth,\r\nbeing native to Cirta, in Numidia. Thence he migrated to Rome in the\r\nreign of Hadrian, and became the most famous rhetorician of his day.\r\nAs a pleader and orator he was counted by his contemporaries hardly\r\ninferior to Tully himself, and as a teacher his aid was sought for the\r\nnoblest youths of Rome. To him was entrusted the education of M.\r\n\r\nAurelius and of his colleague L. Verus in their boyhood; and he was\r\nrewarded for his efforts by a seat in the Senate and the consular rank\r\n(A.D. 143). By the exercise of his profession he became wealthy; and if\r\nhe speaks of his means as not great,[2] he must be comparing his wealth\r\nwith the grandees of Rome, not with the ordinary citizen.\r\n\r\nBefore the present century nothing was known of the works of Fronto,\r\nexcept a grammatical treatise; but in 1815 Cardinal Mai published a\r\nnumber of letters and some short essays of Fronto, which he had\r\ndiscovered in a palimpsest at Milan. Other parts of the same MS. he\r\nfound later in the Vatican, the whole being collected\r\n\r\n[1] References are made to the edition of Naber, Leipzig (Trübner),\r\n1867.\r\n\r\n[2] Ad Verum imp. Aur. Caes., ii, 7. and edited in the year 1823.\r\n\r\nWe now possess parts of his correspondence with Antoninus Pius, with M.\r\nAurelius, with L. Verus, and with certain of his friends, and also\r\nseveral rhetorical and historical fragments. Though none of the more\r\nambitious works of Fronto have survived, there are enough to give proof\r\nof his powers. Never was a great literary reputation less deserved. It\r\nwould be hard to conceive of anything more vapid than the style and\r\nconception of these letters; clearly the man was a pedant without\r\nimagination or taste. Such indeed was the age he lived in, and it is no\r\nmarvel that he was like to his age. But there must have been more in him\r\nthan mere pedantry; there was indeed a heart in the man, which Marcus\r\nfound, and he found also a tongue which could speak the truth. Fronto's\r\nletters are by no means free from exaggeration and laudation, but they\r\ndo not show that loathsome flattery which filled the Roman court. He\r\nreally admires what he praises, and his way of saying so is not unlike\r\nwhat often passes for criticism at the present day. He is not afraid to\r\nreprove what he thinks amiss; and the astonishment of Marcus at this\r\nwill prove, if proof were needed, that he was not used to plain dealing.\r\n\"How happy I am,\" he writes, \"that my friend Marcus Cornelius, so\r\ndistinguished as an orator and so noble as a man, thinks me worth\r\npraising and blaming.\"[3] In another place he deems himself blest\r\nbecause Pronto had taught him to speak the truth[4] although the context\r\nshows him to be speaking of expression, it is still a point in favour of\r\nPronto. A sincere heart is better than literary taste; and if Fronto had\r\nnot done his duty by the young prince, it is not easy to understand the\r\nfriendship which remained between them up to the last.\r\n\r\n[3] Ad M. Caes iii. 17\r\n\r\n[4] Ad M. Caes iii. 12\r\n\r\nAn example of the frankness which was between them is given by a\r\ndifference they had over the case of Herodes Atticus. Herodes was a\r\nGreek rhetorician who had a school at Rome, and Marcus Aurelius was\r\namong his pupils. Both Marcus and the Emperor Antoninus had a high\r\nopinion of Herodes; and all we know goes to prove he was a man of high\r\ncharacter and princely generosity. When quite young he was made\r\nadministrator of the free cities in Asia, nor is it surprising to find\r\nthat he made bitter enemies there; indeed, a just ruler was sure to make\r\nenemies. The end of it was that an Athenian deputation, headed by the\r\norators Theodotus and Demostratus, made serious accusations against his\r\nhonour. There is no need to discuss the merits of the case here; suffice\r\nit to say, Herodes succeeded in defending himself to the satisfaction of\r\nthe emperor. Pronto appears to have taken the delegates' part, and to\r\nhave accepted a brief for the prosecution, urged to some extent by\r\npersonal considerations; and in this cause Marcus Aurelius writes to\r\nFronto as follows:—\r\n\r\n'AURELIUS CÆSAR to his friend FRONTO, greeting.[5]\r\n\r\n'I know you have often told me you were anxious to find how you might\r\nbest please me. Now is the time; now you can increase my love towards\r\nyou, if it can be increased. A trial is at hand, in which people seem\r\nlikely not only to hear your speech with pleasure, but to see your\r\nindignation with impatience. I see no one who dares give you a hint in\r\nthe matter; for those who are less friendly, prefer to see you act with\r\nsome inconsistency; and those who are more friendly, fear to seem too\r\nfriendly to your opponent if they should dissuade you from your\r\naccusation; then again, in case you have prepared something neat for\r\nthe occasion, they cannot endure to rob you of your harangue by\r\nsilencing you. Therefore, whether you think me a rash counsellor, or a\r\nbold boy, or too kind to your opponent, not because I think it better,\r\nI will offer my counsel with some caution. But why have I said, offer\r\nmy counsel? No, I demand it from you; I demand it boldly, and if I\r\nsucceed, I promise to remain under your obligation. What? you will say\r\nif I am attackt, shall I not pay tit for tat? Ah, but you will get\r\ngreater glory, if even when attackt you answer nothing. Indeed, if he\r\nbegins it, answer as you will and you will have fair excuse; but I have\r\ndemanded of him that he shall not begin, and I think I have succeeded.\r\nI love each of you according to your merits and I know that lie was\r\neducated in the house of P. Calvisius, my grandfather, and that I was\r\neducated by you; therefore I am full of anxiety that this most\r\ndisagreeable business shall be managed as honourably as possible. I\r\ntrust you may approve my advice, for my intention you will approve. At\r\nleast I prefer to write unwisely rather than to be silent unkindly.'\r\n\r\n[5] Ad M. Caes ii., 2.\r\n\r\nFronto replied, thanking the prince for his advice, and promising that\r\nhe will confine himself to the facts of the case. But he points out that\r\nthe charges brought against Herodes were such, that they can hardly be\r\nmade agreeable; amongst them being spoliation, violence, and murder.\r\nHowever, he is willing even to let some of these drop if it be the\r\nprince's pleasure. To this Marcus returned the following answer:--[6]\r\n'This one thing, my dearest Fronto, is enough to make me truly grateful\r\nto you, that so far from rejecting my counsel, you have even approved\r\nit. As to the question you raise in your kind letter, my opinion is\r\nthis: all that concerns the case which you are supporting must be\r\nclearly brought forward; what concerns your own feelings, though you may\r\nhave had just provocation, should be left unsaid.' The story does credit\r\nto both. Fronto shows no loss of temper at the interference, nor shrinks\r\nfrom stating his case with frankness; and Marcus, with forbearance\r\nremarkable in a prince, does not command that his friend be left\r\nunmolested, but merely stipulates for a fair trial on the merits of the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n[6] Ad. M. Caes., iii. 5.\r\n\r\nAnother example may be given from a letter of Fronto's[7] Here is\r\nsomething else quarrelsome and querulous. I have sometimes found fault\r\nwith you in your absence somewhat seriously in the company of a few\r\nof my most intimate friends: at times, for example, when you mixt in\r\nsociety with a more solemn look than was fitting, or would read books\r\nin the theatre or in a banquet; nor did I absent myself from theatre\r\nor banquet when you did.[8] Then I used to call you a hard man, no good\r\ncompany, even disagreeable, sometimes, when anger got the better of me.\r\nBut did any one else in the same banquet speak against you, I could\r\nnot endure to hear it with equanimity. Thus it was easier for me to say\r\nsomething to your disadvantage myself, than to hear others do it; just\r\nas I could more easily bear to chastise my daughter Gratia, than to see\r\nher chastised by another.'\r\n\r\n[7] Ad. M. Caes., iv. 12.\r\n\r\n[8] The text is obscure\r\n\r\nThe affection between them is clear from every page of the\r\ncorrespondence. A few instances are now given, which were written at\r\ndifferent periods\r\n\r\nTo MY MASTER.[9]\r\n\r\n'This is how I have past the last few days. My sister was suddenly\r\nseized with an internal pain, so violent that I was horrified at her\r\nlooks; my mother in her trepidation on that account accidentally\r\nbruised her side on a corner of the wall; she and we were greatly\r\ntroubled about that blow. For myself; on going to rest I found a\r\nscorpion in my bed; but I did not lie down upon him, I killed him\r\nfirst. If you are getting on better, that is a consolation. My mother\r\nis easier now, thanks be to God. Good-bye, best and sweetest master. My\r\nlady sends you greeting.'\r\n\r\n[9] Ad M. Caes., v. 8.\r\n\r\n[10]'What words can I find to fit my had luck, or how shall I upbraid as\r\nit deserves the hard constraint which is laid upon me? It ties me fast\r\nhere, troubled my heart is, and beset by such anxiety; nor does it allow\r\nme to make haste to my Fronto, my life and delight, to be near him at\r\nsuch a moment of ill-health in particular, to hold his hands, to chafe\r\ngently that identical foot, so far as may be done without discomfort, to\r\nattend him in the bath, to support his steps with my arm.'\r\n\r\n[10] Ad M. Caes., i. 2.\r\n\r\n[11]'This morning I did not write to you, because I heard you were\r\nbetter, and because I was myself engaged in other business, and I\r\ncannot ever endure to write anything to you unless with mind at ease and\r\nuntroubled and free. So if we are all right, let me know: what I desire,\r\nyou know, and how properly I desire it, I know. Farewell, my master,\r\nalways in every chance first in my mind, as you deserve to be. My\r\nmaster, see I am not asleep, and I compel myself to sleep, that you may\r\nnot be angry with me. You gather I am writing this late at night.'\r\n\r\n[11] iii. 21.\r\n\r\n[12]'What spirit do you suppose is in me, when I remember how long it\r\nis since I have seen you, and why I have not seen you! and it may be\r\nI shall not see you for a few days yet, while you are strengthening\r\nyourself; as you must. So while you lie on the sick-bed, my spirit also\r\nwill lie low anti, whenas,[13] by God's mercy you shall stand upright,\r\nmy spirit too will stand firm, which is now burning with the strongest\r\ndesire for you. Farewell, soul of your prince, your pupil.'\r\n\r\n[14]O my dear Fronto, most distinguished Consul! I yield, you have\r\nconquered: all who have ever loved before, you have conquered out and\r\nout in love's contest. Receive the victor's wreath; and the herald\r\nshall proclaim your victory aloud before your own tribunal: \"M.\r\nCornelius Fronto, Consul, wins, and is crowned victor in the Open\r\nInternational Love-race.\"[15] But beaten though I may be, I shall\r\nneither slacken nor relax my own zeal. Well, you shall love me more\r\nthan any man loves any other man; but I, who possess a faculty of\r\nloving less strong, shall love you more than any one else loves you;\r\nmore indeed than you love yourself. Gratia and I will have to fight for\r\nit; I doubt I shall not get the better of her. For, as Plautus says,\r\nher love is like rain, whose big drops not only penetrate the dress,\r\nbut drench to the very marrow.'\r\n\r\n[12] Ad M. Caes., iii. 19.\r\n\r\n[13] The writer sometimes uses archaisms such as _quom_, which I render\r\n'whenas'.\r\n\r\n[14] Ad M. Caes., ii. 2.\r\n\r\n[15] The writer parodies the proclamation at the Greek games; the words\r\nalso are Greek.\r\n\r\nMarcus Aurelius seems to have been about eighteen years of age when\r\nthe correspondence begins, Fronto being some thirty years older.[16] The\r\nsystematic education of the young prince seems to have been finisht, and\r\nPronto now acts more as his adviser than his tutor. He recommends\r\nthe prince to use simplicity in his public speeches, and to avoid\r\naffectation.[17] Marcus devotes his attention to the old authors who then\r\nhad a great vogue at Rome: Ennius, Plautus, Nævius, and such orators\r\nas Cato and Gracchus.[18] Pronto urges on him the study of Cicero, whose\r\nletters, he says, are all worth reading.\r\n\r\n[16] From internal evidence: the letters are not arranged in order of\r\ntime. See Naher's _Prolegomena_, p. xx. foll.\r\n\r\n[17] Ad M. Caes., iii. x.\r\n\r\n[18] Ad M. Caes ii. 10,; iii. 18,; ii. 4.\r\n\r\nWhen he wishes to compliment Marcus he declares one or other of his\r\nletters has the true Tullian ring. Marcus gives his nights to reading\r\nwhen he ought to be sleeping. He exercises himself in verse composition\r\nand on rhetorical themes.\r\n\r\n'It is very nice of you,' he writes to Fronto,[19] 'to ask for my\r\nhexameters; I would have sent them at once if I had them by me. The fact\r\nis my secretary, Anicetus-you know who I mean-did not pack up any of my\r\ncompositions for me to take away with me. He knows my weakness; he was\r\nafraid that if I got hold of them I might, as usual, make smoke of them.\r\nHowever, there was no fear for the hexameters. I must confess the truth\r\nto my master: I love them. I study at night, since the day is taken up\r\nwith the theatre. I am weary of an evening, and sleepy in the daylight,\r\nand so I don't do much. Yet I have made extracts from sixty books, five\r\nvolumes of them, in these latter days. But when you read remember\r\nthat the \"sixty\" includes plays of Novius, and farces, and some little\r\nspeeches of Scipio; don't be too much startled at the number. You\r\nremember your Polemon; but I pray you do not remember Horace, who has\r\ndied with Pollio as far as I am concerned.[20] Farewell, my dearest\r\nand most affectionate friend, most distinguished consul and my beloved\r\nmaster, whom I have not seen these two years. Those who say two months,\r\ncount the days. Shall I ever see you again?'\r\n\r\n[19] Ad M. Caes., ii. 10.\r\n\r\n[20] He implies, as in i. 6, that he has ceased to study Horace.\r\n\r\nSometimes Fronto sends him a theme to work up, as thus: 'M. Lucilius\r\ntribune of the people violently throws into prison a free Roman citizen,\r\nagainst the opinion of his colleagues who demand his release. For this\r\nact he is branded by the censor. Analyse the case, and then take both\r\nsides in turn, attacking and defending.'[21] Or again: 'A Roman consul,\r\ndoffing his state robe, dons the gauntlet and kills a lion amongst\r\nthe young men at the Quinquatrus in full view of the people of Rome.\r\nDenunciation before the censors.'[22] The prince has a fair knowledge of\r\nGreek, and quotes from Homer, Plato, Euripides, but for some reason\r\nFronto dissuaded him from this study.[23] His _Meditations_ are written in\r\nGreek. He continued his literary studies throughout his life, and after\r\nhe became emperor we still find him asking his adviser for copies of\r\nCicero's Letters, by which he hopes to improve his vocabulary.[24] Pronto\r\nhelps him with a supply of similes, which, it seems, he did not think of\r\nreadily. It is to be feared that the fount of Marcus's eloquence was\r\npumped up by artificial means.\r\n\r\n[21] Pollio was a grammarian, who taught Marcus.\r\n\r\n[22] Ad M. Caes., v. 27,; V. 22.\r\n\r\n[23] Ep. Gracae, 6.\r\n\r\n[24] Ad Anton. Imp., II. 4.\r\n\r\nSome idea of his literary style may be gathered from the letter which\r\nfollows:[25]\r\n\r\n'I heard Polemo declaim the other day, to say something of things\r\nsublunary. If you ask what I thought of him, listen. He seems to me an\r\nindustrious farmer, endowed with the greatest skill, who has cultivated\r\na large estate for corn and vines only, and indeed with a rich return\r\nof fine crops. But yet in that land of his there is no Pompeian fig or\r\nArician vegetable, no Tarentine rose, or pleasing coppice, or thick\r\ngrove, or shady plane tree; all is for use rather than for pleasure,\r\nsuch as one ought rather to commend, but cares not to love.\r\n\r\n[25] Ad M. Caes, ii. 5.\r\n\r\nA pretty bold idea, is it not, and rash judgment, to pass censure on a\r\nman of such reputation? But whenas I remember that I am writing to you,\r\nI think I am less bold than you would have me.\r\n\r\n'In that point I am wholly undecided.\r\n\r\n'There's an unpremeditated hendecasyllable for you. So before I begin to\r\npoetize, I'll take an easy with you. Farewell, my heart's desire, your\r\nVerus's best beloved, most distinguisht consul, master most sweet.\r\nFarewell I ever pray, sweetest soul.\r\n\r\nWhat a letter do you think you have written me I could make bold to\r\nsay, that never did she who bore me and nurst me, write anything SO\r\ndelightful, so honey-sweet. And this does not come of your fine style\r\nand eloquence: otherwise not my mother only, but all who breathe.'\r\n\r\nTo the pupil, never was anything on earth so fine as his master's\r\neloquence; on this theme Marcus fairly bubbles over with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n[26]'Well, if the ancient Greeks ever wrote anything like this, let\r\nthose who know decide it: for me, if I dare say so, I never read any\r\ninvective of Cato's so fine as your encomtum. O if my Lord[27] could be\r\nsufficiently praised, sufficiently praised he would have been\r\nundoubtedly by you! This kind of thing is not done nowadays.[28] It\r\nwere easier to match Pheidias, easier to match Apelles, easier in a\r\nword to match Demosthenes himself, or Cato himself; than to match this\r\nfinisht and perfect work. Never have I read anything more refined,\r\nanything more after the ancient type, anything more delicious, anything\r\nmore Latin. O happy you, to be endowed with eloquence so great! O happy\r\nI, to be tinder the charge of such a master! O arguments,[29] O\r\narrangement, O elegance, O wit, O beauty, O words, O brilliancy, O\r\nsubtilty, O grace, O treatment, O everything! Mischief take me, if you\r\nought not to have a rod put in your hand one day, a diadem on your\r\nbrow, a tribunal raised for you; then the herald would summon us\r\nall-why do I say \"us\"? Would summnon all, those scholars and orators:\r\none by one you would beckon them forward with your rod and admonish\r\nthem. Hitherto I have had no fear of this admonition; many things help\r\nme to enter within your school. I write this in the utmost haste; for\r\nwhenas I am sending you so kindly a letter from my Lord, what needs a\r\nlonger letter of mine? Farewell then, glory of Roman eloquence, boast\r\nof your friends, magnifico, most delightful man, most distinguished\r\nconsul, master most sweet.\r\n\r\n[26] Ad M. Caes., ii. 3.\r\n\r\n[27] The Emperor Antoninus Pius is spoken of as _dominus meus_.\r\n\r\n[28] This sentence is written in Greek.\r\n\r\n[29] Several of these words are Greek, and the meaning is not quite\r\nclear.\r\n\r\n'After this you will take care not to tell so many fibs of me,\r\nespecially in the Senate. A monstrous fine speech this is! O if I could\r\nkiss your head at every heading of it! You have looked down on all with\r\na vengeance. This oration once read, in vain shall we study, in vain\r\nshall we toil, in vain strain every nerve. Farewell always, most sweet\r\nmaster.'\r\n\r\nSometimes Fronto descends from the heights of eloquence to offer\r\npractical advice; as when he suggests how Marcus should deal with his\r\nsuite. It is more difficult, he admits, to keep courtiers in harmony\r\nthan to tame lions with a lute; but if it is to be done, it must be by\r\neradicating jealousy. 'Do not let your friends,' says Fronto,'[30] 'envy\r\neach other, or think that what you give to another is filched from them.\r\n\r\n[30] Ad M Caes., iv. 1.\r\n\r\nKeep away envy from your suite, and you will find your friends kindly\r\nand harmonious.'\r\n\r\nHere and there we meet with allusions to his daily life, which we could\r\nwish to be more frequent. He goes to the theatre or the law-courts,[31]\r\nor takes part in court ceremony, but his heart is always with his\r\nbooks. The vintage season, with its religious rites, was always spent by\r\nAntoninus Pius in the country. The following letters give sonic notion\r\nof a day's occupation at that time:(3)\r\n\r\n[31] ii. 14\r\n\r\n[32] iv. 5,6.\r\n\r\n'MY DEAREST MASTER,--I am well. To-day I studied from the ninth hour of\r\nthe night to the second hour of day, after taking food. I then put on\r\nmy slippers, and from time second to the third hour had a most\r\nenjoyable walk up and down before my chamber. Then booted and\r\ncloaked-for so we were commanded to appear-I went to wait upon my lord\r\nthe emperor. We went a-hunting, did doughty deeds, heard a rumour that\r\nboars had been caught, but there was nothing to see. However, we\r\nclimbed a pretty steep hill, and in the afternoon returned home. I went\r\nstraight to my books. Off with the boots, down with the cloak; I spent\r\na couple of hours in bed. I read Cato's speech on the Property of\r\nPulchra, and another in which he impeaches a tribune. Ho, ho! I hear\r\nyou cry to your man, Off with you as fast as you can, and bring me\r\nthese speeches from the library of Apollo. No use to send: I have those\r\nbooks with me too. You must get round the Tiberian librarian; you will\r\nhave to spend something on the matter; and when I return to town, I\r\nshall expect to go shares with him. Well, after reading these speeches\r\nI wrote a wretched trifle, destined for drowning or burning. No, indeed\r\nmy attempt at writing did not come off at all to-day; the composition\r\nof a hunter or a vintager, whose shouts are echoing through my chamber,\r\nhateful and wearisome as the law-courts. What have I said? Yes, it was\r\nrightly said, for my master is an orator. I think I have caught cold,\r\nwhether from walking in slippers or from writing badly, I do not know.\r\nI am always annoyed with phlegm, but to-day I seem to snivel more than\r\nusual. Well, I will pour oil on my head and go off to sleep. I don't\r\nmean to put one drop in my lamp to-day, so weary am I from riding and\r\nsneezing. Farewell, dearest and most beloved master, whom I miss, I may\r\nsay, more than Rome itself.'\r\n\r\n'MY BELOVED MASTER,-I am well. I slept a little more than usual for my\r\nslight cold, which seems to be well again. So I spent the time from the\r\neleventh hour of the night to the third of the day partly in reading in\r\nCato's Agriculture, partly in writing, not quite so badly as yesterday\r\nindeed. Then, after waiting upon my father, I soothed my throat with\r\nhoney-water, ejecting it without swallowing: I might say _gargle_, but I\r\nwon't, though I think the word is found in Novius and elsewhere. After\r\nattending to my throat I went to my father, and stood by his side as he\r\nsacrificed. Then to luncheon. What do you think I had to eat? A bit of\r\nbread so big, while I watched others gobbling boiled beans, onions,\r\nand fish full of roe. Then we set to work at gathering the grapes,\r\nwith plenty of sweat and shouting, and, as the quotation runs, \"A few\r\nhigh-hanging clusters did we leave survivors of the vintage.\" After the\r\nsixth hour we returned home. I did a little work, and poor work at that.\r\nThen I had a long gossip with my dear mother sitting on the bed. My\r\nconversation was: What do you think my friend Fronto is doing just now?\r\nShe said: And what do you think of my friend Gratia?'[33] My turn now:\r\nAnd what of our little Gratia,[34] the sparrowkin? After this kind of\r\ntalk, and an argument as to which of you loved the other most, the gong\r\nsounded, the signal that my father had gone to the bath. We supped,\r\nafter ablutions in the oil-cellar-I mean we supped after ablutions, not\r\nafter ablutions in the oil-cellar; and listened with enjoyment to the\r\nrustics gibing. After returning, before turning on my side to snore, I\r\ndo my task and give an account of the day to my delightful master, whom\r\nif I could long for a little more, I should not mind growing a trifle\r\nthinner. Farewell, Fronto, wherever you are, honey-sweet, my darling, my\r\ndelight. Why do I want you? I can love you while far away.'\r\n\r\n[33] Fronto's wife.\r\n\r\n[34] Fronto's daughter\r\n\r\nOne anecdote puts Marcus before us in a new light:[35]\r\n\r\n[35] Ad M. Caes ii. 12.\r\n\r\n'When my father returned home from the vineyards, I mounted my horse as\r\nusual, and rode on ahead some little way. Well, there on the road was a\r\nherd of sheep, standing all crowded together as though the place were\r\na desert, with four dogs and two shepherds, but nothing else. Then one\r\nshepherd said to another shepherd, on seeing a number of horsemen: 'I\r\nsay,' says he, 'look you at those horsemen; they do a deal of robbery.'\r\nWhen I heard this, I clap spurs to my horse, and ride straight for the\r\nsheep. In consternation the sheep scatter; hither and thither they are\r\nfleeting and bleating. A shepherd throws his fork, and the fork falls\r\non the horseman who came next to me. We make our escape.' We like Marcus\r\nnone the worse for this spice of mischief.\r\n\r\nAnother letter[36] describes a visit to a country town, and shows the\r\nantiquarian spirit of the writer:—\r\n\r\n'M. CÆSAR to his MASTER M. FRONTO, greeting.\r\n\r\n'After I entered the carriage, after I took leave of you, we made a\r\njourney comfortable enough, but we had a few drops of rain to wet us.\r\nBut before coming to the country-house, we broke our journey at Anagnia,\r\na mile or so from the highroad. Then we inspected that ancient town, a\r\nminiature it is, but has in it many antiquities, temples, and religious\r\nceremonies quite out of the way. There is not a corner without its\r\nshrine, or fane, or temple; besides, many books written on linen, which\r\nbelongs to things sacred. Then on the gate as we came out was written\r\ntwice, as follows: \"Priest don the fell.\"[37] I asked one of the\r\ninhabitants what that word was. He said it was the word in the Hernican\r\ndialect for the victim's skin, which the priest puts over his conical\r\ncap when he enters the city. I found out many other things which I\r\ndesired to know, but the only thing I do not desire is that you should\r\nbe absent from me; that is my chief anxiety. Now for yourself, when you\r\nleft that place, did you go to Aurelia or to Campania? Be sure to write\r\nto me, and say whether you have opened the vintage, or carried a host of\r\nbooks to the country-house; this also, whether you miss me; I am foolish\r\nto ask it, whenas you tell it me of yourself. Now if you miss me and\r\nif you love me, send me your letters often, which is a comfort and\r\nconsolation to me. Indeed I should prefer ten times to read your letters\r\nthan all the vines of Gaurus or the Marsians; for these Signian vines\r\nhave grapes too rank and fruit too sharp in the taste, but I prefer wine\r\nto must for drinking. Besides, those grapes are nicer to eat dried than\r\nfresh-ripe; I vow I would rather tread them under foot than put my teeth\r\nin them. But I pray they may be gracious and forgiving, and grant me\r\nfree pardon for these jests of mine. Farewell, best friend, dearest,\r\nmost learned, sweetest master. When you see the must ferment in the vat,\r\nremember that just so in my heart the longing for you is gushing and\r\nflowing and bubbling. Good-bye.'\r\n\r\n[36] Ad Verum. Imp ii. 1, s. fin.\r\n\r\n[37] Santentum\r\n\r\nMaking all allowances for conventional exaggerations, it is clear from\r\nthe correspondence that there was deep love between Marcus and his\r\npreceptor. The letters cover several years in succession, but soon after\r\nthe birth of Marcus's daughter, Faustina, there is a large gap. It does\r\nnot follow that the letters ceased entirely, because we know part of\r\nthe collection is lost; but there was probably less intercourse between\r\nMarcus and Fronto after Marcus took to the study of philosophy under the\r\nguidance of Rusticus.\r\n\r\nWhen Marcus succeeded to the throne in 161, the letters begin again,\r\nwith slightly increased formality on Fronto's part, and they go on for\r\nsome four years, when Fronto, who has been continually complaining of\r\nill-health, appears to have died. One letter of the later period gives\r\nsome interesting particulars of the emperor's public life, which are\r\nworth quoting. Fronto speaks of Marcus's victories and eloquence in the\r\nusual strain of high praise, and then continues.[38]\r\n\r\n'The army when you took it in hand was sunk in luxury and revelry, and\r\ncorrupted with long inactivity. At Antiochia the soldiers had been Wont\r\nto applaud at the stage plays, knew more of the gardens at the nearest\r\nrestaurant than of the battlefield. Horses were hairy from lack of\r\ngrooming, horsemen smooth because their hairs had been pulled out by\r\nthe roots[39] a rare thing it was to see a soldier with hair on arm or\r\nleg. Moreover, they were better drest than armed; so much so, that\r\nLaelianus Pontius, a strict man of the old discipline, broke the\r\ncuirasses of some of them with his finger-tips, and observed cushions\r\non the horses' backs. At his direction the tufts were cut through, and\r\nout of the horsemen's saddles came what appeared to be feathers pluckt\r\nfrom geese. Few of the men could vault on horseback, the rest clambered\r\nup with difficulty by aid of heel and knee and leg not many could throw\r\na lance hurtling, most did it without force or power, as though they\r\nwere things of wool-dicing was common in the camp, sleep lasted all\r\nnight, or if they kept watch it was over the winecup. By what\r\nregulations to restrain such soldiers as these, and to turn them to\r\nhonesty and industry, did you not learn from Hannibal's sternness, the\r\ndiscipline of Africanus, the acts of Metellus recorded in history.\r\n\r\n[38] Ad Verum. imp., ii. I, s.fin.\r\n\r\n[39] A common mark of the effeminate at Rome.\r\n\r\nAfter the preceptorial letters cease the others are concerned with\r\ndomestic events, health and sickness, visits or introductions, birth or\r\ndeath. Thus the empperor writes to his old friend, who had shown some\r\ndiffidence in seeking an interview:[40]\r\n\r\n[40] Ad Verum. Imp. Aur. Caes., i. 3.\r\n\r\n'To MY MASTER.\r\n\r\n'I have a serious grievance against you, my dear master, yet indeed my\r\ngrief is more than my grievance, because after so long a time I neither\r\nembraced you nor spoke to you, though you visited the palace, and the\r\nmoment after I had left the prince my brother. I reproached my brother\r\nseverely for not recalling me; nor durst he deny the fault.' Fronto\r\nagain writes on one occasion: 'I have seen your daughter. It was like\r\nseeing you and Faustina in infancy, so much that is charming her face\r\nhas taken from each of yours.' Or again, at a later date:[41] I have seen\r\nyour chicks, most delightful sight that ever I saw in my life, so like\r\nyou that nothing is more like than the likeness.... By the mercy of\r\nHeaven they have a healthy colour and strong lungs. One held a piece of\r\nwhite bread, like a little prince, the other a common piece, like a true\r\nphilosophers son.'\r\n\r\n[41] Ad Ant. Imp i., 3.\r\n\r\nMarcus, we know, was devoted to his children. They were delicate in\r\nhealth, in spite of Fronto's assurance, and only one son survived the\r\nfather. We find echoes of this affection now and again in the letters.\r\n'We have summer heat here still,' writes Marcus, 'but since my little\r\ngirls are pretty well, if I may say so, it is like the bracing climate\r\nof spring to us.'[42] When little Faustina came back from the valley of\r\nthe shadow of death, her father at once writes to inform Fronto.[43]\r\nThe sympathy he asks he also gives, and as old age brings more and more\r\ninfirmity, Marcus becomes even more solicitous for his beloved teacher.\r\nThe poor old man suffered a heavy blow in the death of his grandson, on\r\nwhich Marcus writes:[44] 'I have just heard of your misfortune. Feeling\r\ngrieved as I do when one of your joints gives you pain, what do you\r\nthink I feel, dear master, when you have pain of mind?' The old man's\r\nreply, in spite of a certain self-consciousness, is full of pathos. He\r\nrecounts with pride the events of a long and upright life, in which he\r\nhas wronged no man, and lived in harmony with his friends and family.\r\nHis affectations fall away from him, as the cry of pain is forced from\r\nhis heart:--\r\n\r\n[42] Ad M. Caes., v. 19\r\n\r\n[43] iv. 11\r\n\r\n[44] De Nepote Amissa\r\n\r\n[45]'Many such sorrows has fortune visited me with all my life long. To\r\npass by my other afflictions, I have lost five children under the most\r\npitiful conditions possible: for the five I lost one by one when each\r\nwas my only child, suffering these blows of bereavement in such a manner\r\nthat each child was born to one already bereaved. Thus I ever lost my\r\nchildren without solace, and got them amidst fresh grief.....'\r\n\r\n[45] De Nepote Amissa 2\r\n\r\nThe letter continues with reflections on the nature of death, 'more to\r\nbe rejoiced at than bewailed, the younger one dies,' and an arraignment\r\nof Providence not without dignity, wrung from him as it were by this\r\nlast culminating misfortune. It concludes with a summing-up of his life\r\nin protest against the blow which has fallen on his grey head.\r\n\r\n'Through my long life I have committed nothing which might bring\r\ndishonour, or disgrace, or shame: no deed of avarice or treachery have\r\nI done in all my day's: nay, but much generosity, much kindness, much\r\ntruth and faithfulness have I shown, often at the risk of my own life.\r\nI have lived in amity with my good brother, whom I rejoice to see in\r\npossession of the highest office by your father's goodness, and by your\r\nfriendship at peace and perfect rest. The offices which I have myself\r\nobtained I never strove for by any underhand means. I have cultivated\r\nmy mind rather than my body; the pursuit of learning I have preferred to\r\nincreasing my wealth. I preferred to be poor rather than bound by any'\r\nman's obligation, even to want rather than to beg. I have never been\r\nextravagant in spending money, I have earned it sometimes because I\r\nmust. I have scrupulously spoken the truth, and have been glad to hear\r\nit spoken to me. I have thought it better to be neglected than to fawn,\r\nto be dumb than to feign, to be seldom a friend than to be often a\r\nflatterer. I have sought little, deserved not little. So far as I could,\r\nI have assisted each according to my means. I have given help readily\r\nto the deserving, fearlessly to the undeserving. No one by proving to be\r\nungrateful has made me more slow to bestow promptly all benefits I could\r\ngive, nor have I ever been harsh to ingratitude. (A fragmentary passage\r\nfollows, in which he appears to speak of his desire for a peaceful\r\nend, and the desolation of his house.) I have suffered long and painful\r\nsickness, my beloved Marcus. Then I was visited by pitiful misfortunes:\r\nmy wife I have lost, my grandson I have lost in Germany:[46] woe is me!\r\nI have lost my Decimanus. If I were made of iron, at this tine I could\r\nwrite no more.'\r\n\r\n[46] In the war against the Catti.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that in his _Meditations_ Marcus Aurelius mentions\r\nFronto only once.[47] All his literary studies, his oratory and\r\ncriticism (such as it was) is forgotten; and, says he, 'Fronto taught\r\nme not to expect natural affection from the highly-born.' Fronto really\r\nsaid more than this: that 'affection' is not a Roman quality, nor has\r\nit a Latin name.[48] Roman or not Roman, Marcus found affection in\r\nFronto; and if he outgrew his master's intellectual training, he never\r\nlost touch with the true heart of the man it is that which Fronto's\r\nname brings up to his remembrance, not dissertations on compound verbs\r\nor fatuous criticisms of style.\r\n\r\n[47] Book I., 8.\r\n\r\n[48] Ad Verum, ii. 7\r\n\nNOTES\r\n\r\nThis being neither a critical edition of the text nor an emended edition\r\nof Casaubon's translation, it has not been thought necessary to add full\r\nnotes. Casaubon's own notes have been omitted, because for the most part\r\nthey are discursive, and not necessary to an understanding of what is\r\nwritten. In those which here follow, certain emendations of his\r\nare mentioned, which he proposes in his notes, and follows in the\r\ntranslation. In addition, one or two corrections are made where he has\r\nmistaken the Greek, and the translation might be misleading. Those which\r\ndo not come under these two heads will explain themselves.\r\n\r\nThe text itself has been prepared by a comparison of the editions of\r\n1634 and 1635. It should be borne in mind that Casaubon's is often\r\nrather a paraphrase than a close translation; and it did not seem worth\r\nwhile to notice every variation or amplification of the original. In\r\nthe original editions all that Casaubon conceives as understood, but\r\nnot expressed, is enclosed in square brackets. These brackets are here\r\nomitted, as they interfere with the comfort of the reader; and so have\r\nsome of the alternative renderings suggested by the translator. In a few\r\ncases, Latin words in the text have been replaced by English.\r\n\r\nNumbers in brackets refer to the Teubner text of Stich, but the\r\ndivisions of the text are left unaltered. For some of the references\r\nidentified I am indebted to Mr. G. H. Rendall's _Marcus Aurelius_.\r\n\r\nBOOK II \"Both to frequent\" (4). Gr. τὸ μή, C. conjectures τὸ μὲ. The\r\ntext is probably right: \"I did not frequent public lectures, and I was\r\ntaught at home.\"\r\n\r\nVI Idiots.... philosophers (9). The reading is doubtful, but the meaning\r\nseems to be: \"simple and unlearned men\"\r\n\r\nXII \"Claudius Maximus\" (15). The reading of the Palatine MS. (now lost)\r\nwas paraklhsiz Maximon, which C. supposes to conceal the letters kl as\r\nan abbreviation of Claudius.\r\n\r\nXIII \"Patient hearing... He would not\" (16). C. translates his\r\nconjectural reading epimonon ollan. on proapsth Stich suggests a reading\r\nwith much the same sense: .....epimonon all antoi \"Strict and rigid\r\ndealing\" (16). C. translates tonvn (Pal. MS.) as though from tonoz,\r\nin the sense of \"strain.\" \"rigour.\" The reading of other MSS. tonvn is\r\npreferable.\r\n\r\nXIII \"Congiaries\" (13). dianomais, \"doles.\"\r\n\r\nXIV \"Cajeta\" (17). The passage is certainly corrupt. C. spies a\r\nreference to Chryses praying by the sea-shore in the Illiad, and\r\nsupposes M. Aurelius to have done the like. None of the emendations\r\nsuggested is satisfactory. At § XV. Book II. is usually reckoned to\r\nbegin. BOOK II III. \"Do, soul\" (6). If the received reading be right,\r\nit must be sarcastic; but there are several variants which show how\r\nunsatisfactory it is. C. translates \"en gar o bioz ekasty so par eanty\",\r\nwhich I do not understand. The sense required is: \"Do not violence to\r\nthyself, for thou hast not long to use self-respect. Life is not (v. 1.\r\nso long for each, and this life for thee is all but done.\""
