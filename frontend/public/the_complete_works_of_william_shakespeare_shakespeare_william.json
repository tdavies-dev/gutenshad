These I know.\r\nWho’s that that bears the sceptre?\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\r\nMarquess Dorset,\r\nAnd that the Earl of Surrey with the rod.\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\r\nA bold brave gentleman. That should be\r\nThe Duke of Suffolk.\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\r\n’Tis the same: High Steward.\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\r\nAnd that my Lord of Norfolk?\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\r\n[_Sees the Queen_.] Heaven bless thee!\r\nThou hast the sweetest face I ever looked on.\r\nSir, as I have a soul, she is an angel.\r\nOur King has all the Indies in his arms,\r\nAnd more, and richer, when he strains that lady.\r\nI cannot blame his conscience.\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\r\nThey that bear\r\nThe cloth of honour over her are four barons\r\nOf the Cinque Ports.\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\r\nThose men are happy, and so are all are near her.\r\nI take it she that carries up the train\r\nIs that old noble lady, Duchess of Norfolk.\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\r\nIt is, and all the rest are countesses.\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\r\nTheir coronets say so. These are stars indeed.\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\r\nAnd sometimes falling ones.\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\r\nNo more of that.\r\n\r\n[_Exit the last of the procession._]\r\n\r\nEnter a third Gentleman.\r\n\r\nGod save you, sir. Where have you been broiling?\r\n\r\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.\r\nAmong the crowds i’ th’ Abbey, where a finger\r\nCould not be wedged in more. I am stifled\r\nWith the mere rankness of their joy.\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\r\nYou saw\r\nThe ceremony?\r\n\r\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.\r\nThat I did.\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\r\nHow was it?\r\n\r\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.\r\nWell worth the seeing.\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\r\nGood sir, speak it to us.\r\n\r\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.\r\nAs well as I am able. The rich stream\r\nOf lords and ladies, having brought the Queen\r\nTo a prepared place in the choir, fell off\r\nA distance from her, while her Grace sat down\r\nTo rest a while, some half an hour or so,\r\nIn a rich chair of state, opposing freely\r\nThe beauty of her person to the people.\r\nBelieve me, sir, she is the goodliest woman\r\nThat ever lay by man, which when the people\r\nHad the full view of, such a noise arose\r\nAs the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest,\r\nAs loud and to as many tunes. Hats, cloaks,\r\nDoublets, I think, flew up, and had their faces\r\nBeen loose, this day they had been lost. Such joy\r\nI never saw before. Great-bellied women\r\nThat had not half a week to go, like rams\r\nIn the old time of war, would shake the press\r\nAnd make ’em reel before ’em. No man living\r\nCould say “This is my wife” there, all were woven\r\nSo strangely in one piece.\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\r\nBut what followed?\r\n\r\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.\r\nAt length her Grace rose, and with modest paces\r\nCame to the altar, where she kneeled and saintlike\r\nCast her fair eyes to heaven and prayed devoutly;\r\nThen rose again and bowed her to the people,\r\nWhen by the Archbishop of Canterbury\r\nShe had all the royal makings of a queen,\r\nAs holy oil, Edward Confessor’s crown,\r\nThe rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblems\r\nLaid nobly on her; which performed, the choir,\r\nWith all the choicest music of the kingdom,\r\nTogether sung _Te Deum_. So she parted,\r\nAnd with the same full state paced back again\r\nTo York Place, where the feast is held.\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\r\nSir,\r\nYou must no more call it “York Place”, that’s past;\r\nFor since the Cardinal fell, that title’s lost.\r\n’Tis now the King’s, and called “Whitehall”.\r\n\r\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.\r\nI know it,\r\nBut ’tis so lately altered that the old name\r\nIs fresh about me.\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\r\nWhat two reverend bishops\r\nWere those that went on each side of the Queen?\r\n\r\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.\r\nStokesley and Gardiner, the one of Winchester,\r\nNewly preferred from the King’s secretary;\r\nThe other, London.\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\r\nHe of Winchester\r\nIs held no great good lover of the Archbishop’s,\r\nThe virtuous Cranmer.\r\n\r\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.\r\nAll the land knows that.\r\nHowever, yet there is no great breach. When it comes,\r\nCranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him.\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\r\nWho may that be, I pray you?\r\n\r\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.\r\nThomas Cromwell,\r\nA man in much esteem with th’ King, and truly\r\nA worthy friend. The King has made him\r\nMaster o’ th’ Jewel House,\r\nAnd one already of the Privy Council.\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\r\nHe will deserve more.\r\n\r\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.\r\nYes, without all doubt.\r\nCome, gentlemen, ye shall go my way,\r\nWhich is to th’ court, and there ye shall be my guests,\r\nSomething I can command. As I walk thither,\r\nI’ll tell ye more.\r\n\r\nBOTH.\r\nYou may command us, sir.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. Kimbolton.\r\n\r\nEnter Katherine Dowager, sick, led between Griffith, her gentleman\r\nusher, and Patience, her woman.\r\n\r\nGRIFFITH.\r\nHow does your Grace?\r\n\r\nQUEEN KATHERINE.\r\nO Griffith, sick to death.\r\nMy legs like loaden branches bow to th’ earth,\r\nWilling to leave their burden. Reach a chair.\r\n\r\n[_She sits._]\r\n\r\nSo. Now, methinks, I feel a little ease.\r\nDidst thou not tell me, Griffith, as thou ledst me,\r\nThat the great child of honour, Cardinal Wolsey,\r\nWas dead?\r\n\r\nGRIFFITH.\r\nYes, madam, but I think your Grace,\r\nOut of the pain you suffered, gave no ear to’t.\r\n\r\nQUEEN KATHERINE.\r\nPrithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died.\r\nIf well, he stepped before me happily\r\nFor my example.\r\n\r\nGRIFFITH.\r\nWell, the voice goes, madam.\r\nFor after the stout Earl Northumberland\r\nArrested him at York and brought him forward,\r\nAs a man sorely tainted, to his answer,\r\nHe fell sick suddenly and grew so ill\r\nHe could not sit his mule.\r\n\r\nQUEEN KATHERINE.\r\nAlas, poor man!\r\n\r\nGRIFFITH.\r\nAt last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester,\r\nLodged in the abbey, where the reverend abbot,\r\nWith all his covent, honourably received him;\r\nTo whom he gave these words: “O father abbot,\r\nAn old man, broken with the storms of state,\r\nIs come to lay his weary bones among ye.\r\nGive him a little earth for charity.”\r\nSo went to bed, where eagerly his sickness\r\nPursued him still; and three nights after this,\r\nAbout the hour of eight, which he himself\r\nForetold should be his last, full of repentance,\r\nContinual meditations, tears, and sorrows,\r\nHe gave his honours to the world again,\r\nHis blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.\r\n\r\nQUEEN KATHERINE.\r\nSo may he rest. His faults lie gently on him!\r\nYet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him,\r\nAnd yet with charity. He was a man\r\nOf an unbounded stomach, ever ranking\r\nHimself with princes; one that by suggestion\r\nTied all the kingdom. Simony was fair-play.\r\nHis own opinion was his law. I’ th’ presence\r\nHe would say untruths, and be ever double\r\nBoth in his words and meaning. He was never,\r\nBut where he meant to ruin, pitiful.\r\nHis promises were, as he then was, mighty;\r\nBut his performance, as he is now, nothing.\r\nOf his own body he was ill, and gave\r\nThe clergy ill example.\r\n\r\nGRIFFITH.\r\nNoble madam,\r\nMen’s evil manners live in brass; their virtues\r\nWe write in water. May it please your Highness\r\nTo hear me speak his good now?\r\n\r\nQUEEN KATHERINE.\r\nYes, good Griffith;\r\nI were malicious else.\r\n\r\nGRIFFITH.\r\nThis Cardinal,\r\nThough from an humble stock, undoubtedly\r\nWas fashioned to much honour. From his cradle\r\nHe was a scholar, and a ripe and good one,\r\nExceeding wise, fair-spoken, and persuading;\r\nLofty and sour to them that loved him not,\r\nBut to those men that sought him, sweet as summer.\r\nAnd though he were unsatisfied in getting,\r\nWhich was a sin, yet in bestowing, madam,\r\nHe was most princely. Ever witness for him\r\nThose twins of learning that he raised in you,\r\nIpswich and Oxford, one of which fell with him,\r\nUnwilling to outlive the good that did it;\r\nThe other, though unfinished, yet so famous,\r\nSo excellent in art, and still so rising,\r\nThat Christendom shall ever speak his virtue.\r\nHis overthrow heaped happiness upon him,\r\nFor then, and not till then, he felt himself,\r\nAnd found the blessedness of being little.\r\nAnd, to add greater honours to his age\r\nThan man could give him, he died fearing God.\r\n\r\nQUEEN KATHERINE.\r\nAfter my death I wish no other herald,\r\nNo other speaker of my living actions,\r\nTo keep mine honour from corruption\r\nBut such an honest chronicler as Griffith.\r\nWhom I most hated living, thou hast made me,\r\nWith thy religious truth and modesty,\r\nNow in his ashes honour. Peace be with him!\r\nPatience, be near me still, and set me lower:\r\nI have not long to trouble thee. Good Griffith,\r\nCause the musicians play me that sad note\r\nI named my knell, whilst I sit meditating\r\nOn that celestial harmony I go to.\r\n\r\n[_Sad and solemn music._]\r\n\r\nGRIFFITH.\r\nShe is asleep. Good wench, let’s sit down quiet,\r\nFor fear we wake her. Softly, gentle Patience.\r\n\r\n_The vision._\r\n\nEnter, solemnly tripping one after another, six Personages, clad in\r\nwhite robes, wearing on their heads garlands of bays, and golden\r\nvizards on their faces, branches of bays or palm in their hands. They\r\nfirst congee unto her, then dance; and, at certain changes, the first\r\ntwo hold a spare garland over her head, at which the other four make\r\nreverent curtsies. Then the two that held the garland deliver the same\r\nto the other next two, who observe the same order in their changes and\r\nholding the garland over her head; which done, they deliver the same\r\ngarland to the last two, who likewise observe the same order. At which,\r\nas it were by inspiration, she makes in her sleep signs of rejoicing\r\nand holdeth up her hands to heaven. And so in their dancing, vanish,\r\ncarrying the garland with them. The music continues.\r\n\r\nQUEEN KATHERINE.\r\nSpirits of peace, where are ye? Are ye all gone,\r\nAnd leave me here in wretchedness behind ye?\r\n\r\nGRIFFITH.\r\nMadam, we are here.\r\n\r\nQUEEN KATHERINE.\r\nIt is not you I call for.\r\nSaw ye none enter since I slept?\r\n\r\nGRIFFITH.\r\nNone, madam.\r\n\r\nQUEEN KATHERINE.\r\nNo? Saw you not, even now, a blessed troop\r\nInvite me to a banquet, whose bright faces\r\nCast thousand beams upon me, like the sun?\r\nThey promised me eternal happiness\r\nAnd brought me garlands, Griffith, which I feel\r\nI am not worthy yet to wear. I shall, assuredly.\r\n\r\nGRIFFITH.\r\nI am most joyful, madam, such good dreams\r\nPossess your fancy.\r\n\r\nQUEEN KATHERINE.\r\nBid the music leave,\r\nThey are harsh and heavy to me.\r\n\r\n[_Music ceases._]\r\n\r\nPATIENCE.\r\nDo you note\r\nHow much her Grace is altered on the sudden?\r\nHow long her face is drawn? How pale she looks,\r\nAnd of an earthly cold? Mark her eyes.\r\n\r\nGRIFFITH.\r\nShe is going, wench. Pray, pray.\r\n\r\nPATIENCE.\r\nHeaven comfort her!\r\n\r\nEnter a Messenger.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nAn’t like your Grace—\r\n\r\nQUEEN KATHERINE.\r\nYou are a saucy fellow.\r\nDeserve we no more reverence?\r\n\r\nGRIFFITH.\r\nYou are to blame,\r\nKnowing she will not lose her wonted greatness,\r\nTo use so rude behaviour. Go to, kneel.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nI humbly do entreat your Highness’ pardon.\r\nMy haste made me unmannerly. There is staying\r\nA gentleman sent from the King to see you.\r\n\r\nQUEEN KATHERINE.\r\nAdmit him entrance, Griffith. But this fellow\r\nLet me ne’er see again.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Messenger._]\r\n\r\nEnter Lord Caputius.\r\n\r\nIf my sight fail not,\r\nYou should be lord ambassador from the Emperor,\r\nMy royal nephew, and your name Caputius.\r\n\r\nCAPUTIUS.\r\nMadam, the same. Your servant.\r\n\r\nQUEEN KATHERINE.\r\nO my lord,\r\nThe times and titles now are altered strangely\r\nWith me since first you knew me. But I pray you,\r\nWhat is your pleasure with me?\r\n\r\nCAPUTIUS.\r\nNoble lady,\r\nFirst, mine own service to your Grace; the next,\r\nThe King’s request that I would visit you,\r\nWho grieves much for your weakness, and by me\r\nSends you his princely commendations,\r\nAnd heartily entreats you take good comfort.\r\n\r\nQUEEN KATHERINE.\r\nO my good lord, that comfort comes too late;\r\n’Tis like a pardon after execution.\r\nThat gentle physic given in time had cured me,\r\nBut now I am past all comforts here but prayers.\r\nHow does his Highness?\r\n\r\nCAPUTIUS.\r\nMadam, in good health.\r\n\r\nQUEEN KATHERINE.\r\nSo may he ever do, and ever flourish,\r\nWhen I shall dwell with worms, and my poor name\r\nBanished the kingdom. Patience, is that letter\r\nI caused you write yet sent away?\r\n\r\nPATIENCE.\r\nNo, madam.\r\n\r\n[_Giving it to Katherine._]\r\n\r\nQUEEN KATHERINE.\r\nSir, I most humbly pray you to deliver\r\nThis to my lord the King.\r\n\r\nCAPUTIUS.\r\nMost willing, madam.\r\n\r\nQUEEN KATHERINE.\r\nIn which I have commended to his goodness\r\nThe model of our chaste loves, his young daughter—\r\nThe dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her!—\r\nBeseeching him to give her virtuous breeding—\r\nShe is young and of a noble modest nature;\r\nI hope she will deserve well—and a little\r\nTo love her for her mother’s sake that loved him,\r\nHeaven knows how dearly. My next poor petition\r\nIs that his noble Grace would have some pity\r\nUpon my wretched women, that so long\r\nHave followed both my fortunes faithfully;\r\nOf which there is not one, I dare avow—\r\nAnd now I should not lie—but will deserve,\r\nFor virtue and true beauty of the soul,\r\nFor honesty and decent carriage,\r\nA right good husband. Let him be a noble;\r\nAnd sure those men are happy that shall have ’em.\r\nThe last is for my men—they are the poorest,\r\nBut poverty could never draw ’em from me—\r\nThat they may have their wages duly paid ’em,\r\nAnd something over to remember me by.\r\nIf heaven had pleased to have given me longer life\r\nAnd able means, we had not parted thus.\r\nThese are the whole contents, and, good my lord,\r\nBy that you love the dearest in this world,\r\nAs you wish Christian peace to souls departed,\r\nStand these poor people’s friend, and urge the King\r\nTo do me this last right.\r\n\r\nCAPUTIUS.\r\nBy heaven, I will,\r\nOr let me lose the fashion of a man!\r\n\r\nQUEEN KATHERINE.\r\nI thank you, honest lord. Remember me\r\nIn all humility unto his Highness.\r\nSay his long trouble now is passing\r\nOut of this world. Tell him in death I blessed him,\r\nFor so I will. Mine eyes grow dim. Farewell,\r\nMy lord. Griffith, farewell. Nay, Patience,\r\nYou must not leave me yet. I must to bed;\r\nCall in more women. When I am dead, good wench,\r\nLet me be used with honour. Strew me over\r\nWith maiden flowers, that all the world may know\r\nI was a chaste wife to my grave. Embalm me,\r\nThen lay me forth. Although unqueened, yet like\r\nA queen and daughter to a king inter me.\r\nI can no more.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt leading Katherine._]\r\n\nACT V\r\n\r\nSCENE I. A gallery in the palace.\r\n\nEnter Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, a Page with a torch before him,\r\nmet by Sir Thomas Lovell.\r\n\r\nGARDINER.\r\nIt’s one o’clock, boy, is’t not?\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nIt hath struck.\r\n\r\nGARDINER.\r\nThese should be hours for necessities,\r\nNot for delights; times to repair our nature\r\nWith comforting repose, and not for us\r\nTo waste these times. Good hour of night, Sir Thomas!\r\nWhither so late?\r\n\r\nLOVELL.\r\nCame you from the King, my lord?\r\n\r\nGARDINER.\r\nI did, Sir Thomas, and left him at primero\r\nWith the Duke of Suffolk.\r\n\r\nLOVELL.\r\nI must to him too,\r\nBefore he go to bed. I’ll take my leave.\r\n\r\nGARDINER.\r\nNot yet, Sir Thomas Lovell. What’s the matter?\r\nIt seems you are in haste. An if there be\r\nNo great offence belongs to’t, give your friend\r\nSome touch of your late business. Affairs that walk,\r\nAs they say spirits do, at midnight have\r\nIn them a wilder nature than the business\r\nThat seeks despatch by day.\r\n\r\nLOVELL.\r\nMy lord, I love you,\r\nAnd durst commend a secret to your ear\r\nMuch weightier than this work. The Queen’s in labour—\r\nThey say in great extremity, and feared\r\nShe’ll with the labour end.\r\n\r\nGARDINER.\r\nThe fruit she goes with\r\nI pray for heartily, that it may find\r\nGood time, and live; but for the stock, Sir Thomas,\r\nI wish it grubbed up now.\r\n\r\nLOVELL.\r\nMethinks I could\r\nCry the amen, and yet my conscience says\r\nShe’s a good creature and, sweet lady, does\r\nDeserve our better wishes.\r\n\r\nGARDINER.\r\nBut, sir, sir,\r\nHear me, Sir Thomas. You’re a gentleman\r\nOf mine own way. I know you wise, religious;\r\nAnd let me tell you, it will ne’er be well,\r\n’Twill not, Sir Thomas Lovell, take’t of me,\r\nTill Cranmer, Cromwell, her two hands, and she\r\nSleep in their graves.\r\n\r\nLOVELL.\r\nNow, sir, you speak of two\r\nThe most remarked i’ th’ kingdom. As for Cromwell,\r\nBeside that of the Jewel House, is made Master\r\nO’ th’ Rolls, and the King’s secretary; further, sir,\r\nStands in the gap and trade of more preferments,\r\nWith which the time will load him. Th’ Archbishop\r\nIs the King’s hand and tongue, and who dare speak\r\nOne syllable against him?\r\n\r\nGARDINER.\r\nYes, yes, Sir Thomas,\r\nThere are that dare, and I myself have ventured\r\nTo speak my mind of him. And indeed this day,\r\nSir—I may tell it you, I think—I have\r\nIncensed the lords o’ th’ Council, that he is—\r\nFor so I know he is, they know he is—\r\nA most arch heretic, a pestilence\r\nThat does infect the land; with which they, moved,\r\nHave broken with the King, who hath so far\r\nGiven ear to our complaint, of his great grace\r\nAnd princely care foreseeing those fell mischiefs\r\nOur reasons laid before him, hath commanded\r\nTomorrow morning to the Council board\r\nHe be convented. He’s a rank weed, Sir Thomas,\r\nAnd we must root him out. From your affairs\r\nI hinder you too long. Good night, Sir Thomas.\r\n\r\nLOVELL.\r\nMany good nights, my lord. I rest your servant.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Gardiner and Page._]\r\n\r\nEnter King and Suffolk.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nCharles, I will play no more tonight.\r\nMy mind’s not on’t; you are too hard for me.\r\n\r\nSUFFOLK.\r\nSir, I did never win of you before.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nBut little, Charles,\r\nNor shall not, when my fancy’s on my play.\r\nNow, Lovell, from the Queen what is the news?\r\n\r\nLOVELL.\r\nI could not personally deliver to her\r\nWhat you commanded me, but by her woman\r\nI sent your message, who returned her thanks\r\nIn the great’st humbleness, and desired your Highness\r\nMost heartily to pray for her.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nWhat sayst thou, ha?\r\nTo pray for her? What, is she crying out?\r\n\r\nLOVELL.\r\nSo said her woman, and that her suff’rance made\r\nAlmost each pang a death.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nAlas, good lady!\r\n\r\nSUFFOLK.\r\nGod safely quit her of her burden, and\r\nWith gentle travail, to the gladding of\r\nYour Highness with an heir!\r\n\r\nKING.\r\n’Tis midnight, Charles.\r\nPrithee, to bed, and in thy prayers remember\r\nTh’ estate of my poor Queen. Leave me alone,\r\nFor I must think of that which company\r\nWill not be friendly to.\r\n\r\nSUFFOLK.\r\nI wish your Highness\r\nA quiet night, and my good mistress will\r\nRemember in my prayers.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nCharles, good night.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Suffolk._]\r\n\r\nEnter Sir Anthony Denny.\r\n\r\nWell, sir, what follows?\r\n\r\nDENNY.\r\nSir, I have brought my lord the Archbishop,\r\nAs you commanded me.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nHa! Canterbury?\r\n\r\nDENNY.\r\nAy, my good lord.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\n’Tis true. Where is he, Denny?\r\n\r\nDENNY.\r\nHe attends your Highness’ pleasure.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nBring him to us.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Denny._]\r\n\r\nLOVELL.\r\n[_Aside_.] This is about that which the Bishop spake.\r\nI am happily come hither.\r\n\r\nEnter Cranmer and Denny.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nAvoid the gallery. [_Lovell seems to stay_.]\r\nHa! I have said. Be gone.\r\nWhat!\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Lovell and Denny._]\r\n\r\nCRANMER.\r\n[_Aside_.] I am fearful. Wherefore frowns he thus?\r\n’Tis his aspect of terror. All’s not well.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nHow now, my lord? You do desire to know\r\nWherefore I sent for you.\r\n\r\nCRANMER.\r\n[_Kneeling_.] It is my duty\r\nT’ attend your Highness’ pleasure.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nPray you, arise,\r\nMy good and gracious Lord of Canterbury.\r\nCome, you and I must walk a turn together.\r\nI have news to tell you. Come, come, give me your hand.\r\nAh, my good lord, I grieve at what I speak,\r\nAnd am right sorry to repeat what follows.\r\nI have, and most unwillingly, of late\r\nHeard many grievous—I do say, my lord,\r\nGrievous—complaints of you, which, being considered,\r\nHave moved us and our Council that you shall\r\nThis morning come before us, where I know,\r\nYou cannot with such freedom purge yourself\r\nBut that, till further trial in those charges\r\nWhich will require your answer, you must take\r\nYour patience to you and be well contented\r\nTo make your house our Tower. You a brother of us,\r\nIt fits we thus proceed, or else no witness\r\nWould come against you.\r\n\r\nCRANMER.\r\n[_Kneeling_.] I humbly thank your Highness,\r\nAnd am right glad to catch this good occasion\r\nMost throughly to be winnowed, where my chaff\r\nAnd corn shall fly asunder. For I know\r\nThere’s none stands under more calumnious tongues\r\nThan I myself, poor man.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nStand up, good Canterbury!\r\nThy truth and thy integrity is rooted\r\nIn us, thy friend. Give me thy hand. Stand up.\r\nPrithee, let’s walk. Now, by my halidom,\r\nWhat manner of man are you? My lord, I looked\r\nYou would have given me your petition that\r\nI should have ta’en some pains to bring together\r\nYourself and your accusers and to have heard you\r\nWithout endurance, further.\r\n\r\nCRANMER.\r\nMost dread liege,\r\nThe good I stand on is my truth and honesty.\r\nIf they shall fail, I with mine enemies\r\nWill triumph o’er my person, which I weigh not,\r\nBeing of those virtues vacant. I fear nothing\r\nWhat can be said against me.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nKnow you not\r\nHow your state stands i’ th’ world, with the whole world?\r\nYour enemies are many, and not small; their practices\r\nMust bear the same proportion, and not ever\r\nThe justice and the truth o’ th’ question carries\r\nThe due o’ th’ verdict with it. At what ease\r\nMight corrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt\r\nTo swear against you? Such things have been done.\r\nYou are potently opposed, and with a malice\r\nOf as great size. Ween you of better luck,\r\nI mean in perjured witness, than your master,\r\nWhose minister you are, whiles here he lived\r\nUpon this naughty earth? Go to, go to.\r\nYou take a precipice for no leap of danger,\r\nAnd woo your own destruction.\r\n\r\nCRANMER.\r\nGod and your Majesty\r\nProtect mine innocence, or I fall into\r\nThe trap is laid for me.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nBe of good cheer.\r\nThey shall no more prevail than we give way to.\r\nKeep comfort to you, and this morning see\r\nYou do appear before them. If they shall chance,\r\nIn charging you with matters, to commit you,\r\nThe best persuasions to the contrary\r\nFail not to use, and with what vehemency\r\nTh’ occasion shall instruct you. If entreaties\r\nWill render you no remedy, this ring\r\nDeliver them, and your appeal to us\r\nThere make before them. Look, the good man weeps!\r\nHe’s honest, on mine honour. God’s blest mother,\r\nI swear he is true-hearted, and a soul\r\nNone better in my kingdom.—Get you gone,\r\nAnd do as I have bid you.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Cranmer._]\r\n\r\nHe has strangled\r\nHis language in his tears.\r\n\r\nLOVELL.\r\n[_Within_.] Come back! What mean you?\r\n\r\nEnter Old Lady; Lovell follows.\r\n\r\nOLD LADY.\r\nI’ll not come back. The tidings that I bring\r\nWill make my boldness manners. Now, good angels\r\nFly o’er thy royal head and shade thy person\r\nUnder their blessed wings!\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nNow by thy looks\r\nI guess thy message. Is the Queen delivered?\r\nSay “Ay, and of a boy”.\r\n\r\nOLD LADY.\r\nAy, ay, my liege,\r\nAnd of a lovely boy. The God of heaven\r\nBoth now and ever bless her! ’Tis a girl\r\nPromises boys hereafter. Sir, your Queen\r\nDesires your visitation, and to be\r\nAcquainted with this stranger. ’Tis as like you\r\nAs cherry is to cherry.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nLovell.\r\n\r\nLOVELL.\r\nSir?\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nGive her an hundred marks. I’ll to the Queen.\r\n\r\n[_Exit King._]\r\n\r\nOLD LADY.\r\nAn hundred marks? By this light, I’ll ha’ more.\r\nAn ordinary groom is for such payment.\r\nI will have more or scold it out of him.\r\nSaid I for this the girl was like to him?\r\nI’ll have more, or else unsay’t. And now,\r\nWhile ’tis hot, I’ll put it to the issue.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. Lobby before the council-chamber.\r\n\r\nEnter Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury.\r\n\r\nCRANMER.\r\nI hope I am not too late, and yet the gentleman\r\nThat was sent to me from the Council prayed me\r\nTo make great haste. All fast? What means this? Ho!\r\nWho waits there?\r\n\r\nEnter Keeper.\r\n\r\nSure you know me?\r\n\r\nKEEPER.\r\nYes, my lord,\r\nBut yet I cannot help you.\r\n\r\nCRANMER.\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nKEEPER.\r\nYour Grace must wait till you be called for.\r\n\r\nEnter Doctor Butts.\r\n\r\nCRANMER.\r\nSo.\r\n\r\nBUTTS.\r\n[_Aside_.] This is a piece of malice. I am glad\r\nI came this way so happily. The King\r\nShall understand it presently.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nCRANMER.\r\n[_Aside_.] ’Tis Butts,\r\nThe King’s physician. As he passed along,\r\nHow earnestly he cast his eyes upon me!\r\nPray heaven he sound not my disgrace. For certain,\r\nThis is of purpose laid by some that hate me—\r\nGod turn their hearts! I never sought their malice—\r\nTo quench mine honour. They would shame to make me\r\nWait else at door, a fellow councillor,\r\n’Mong boys, grooms, and lackeys. But their pleasures\r\nMust be fulfilled, and I attend with patience.\r\n\r\nEnter the King and Butts at a window above.\r\n\r\nBUTTS.\r\nI’ll show your Grace the strangest sight.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nWhat’s that, Butts?\r\n\r\nBUTTS.\r\nI think your Highness saw this many a day.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nBody o’ me, where is it?\r\n\r\nBUTTS.\r\nThere, my lord:\r\nThe high promotion of his Grace of Canterbury,\r\nWho holds his state at door, ’mongst pursuivants,\r\nPages, and footboys.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nHa! ’Tis he, indeed.\r\nIs this the honour they do one another?\r\n’Tis well there’s one above ’em yet. I had thought\r\nThey had parted so much honesty among ’em—\r\nAt least good manners—as not thus to suffer\r\nA man of his place, and so near our favour,\r\nTo dance attendance on their lordships’ pleasures,\r\nAnd at the door too, like a post with packets.\r\nBy holy Mary, Butts, there’s knavery!\r\nLet ’em alone, and draw the curtain close.\r\nWe shall hear more anon.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nA council table brought in with chairs and stools and placed under the\r\nstate. Enter Lord Chancellor, places himself at the upper end of the\r\ntable on the left hand, a seat being left void above him, as for\r\nCanterbury’s seat. Duke of Suffolk, Duke of Norfolk, Surrey, Lord\r\nChamberlain, Gardiner seat themselves in order on each side; Cromwell\r\nat lower end, as secretary.\r\n\r\nCHANCELLOR.\r\nSpeak to the business, master secretary.\r\nWhy are we met in council?\r\n\r\nCROMWELL.\r\nPlease your honours,\r\nThe chief cause concerns his Grace of Canterbury.\r\n\r\nGARDINER.\r\nHas he had knowledge of it?\r\n\r\nCROMWELL.\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nNORFOLK.\r\nWho waits there?\r\n\r\nKEEPER.\r\nWithout, my noble lords?\r\n\r\nGARDINER.\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nKEEPER.\r\nMy lord Archbishop,\r\nAnd has done half an hour, to know your pleasures.\r\n\r\nCHANCELLOR.\r\nLet him come in.\r\n\r\nKEEPER.\r\nYour Grace may enter now.\r\n\r\nCranmer approaches the council table.\r\n\r\nCHANCELLOR.\r\nMy good lord Archbishop, I’m very sorry\r\nTo sit here at this present and behold\r\nThat chair stand empty. But we all are men,\r\nIn our own natures frail, and capable\r\nOf our flesh—few are angels—out of which frailty\r\nAnd want of wisdom, you that best should teach us,\r\nHave misdemeaned yourself, and not a little,\r\nToward the King first, then his laws, in filling\r\nThe whole realm, by your teaching and your chaplains’—\r\nFor so we are informed—with new opinions,\r\nDivers and dangerous, which are heresies\r\nAnd, not reformed, may prove pernicious.\r\n\r\nGARDINER.\r\nWhich reformation must be sudden too,\r\nMy noble lords; for those that tame wild horses\r\nPace ’em not in their hands to make ’em gentle,\r\nBut stop their mouth with stubborn bits and spur ’em\r\nTill they obey the manage. If we suffer,\r\nOut of our easiness and childish pity\r\nTo one man’s honour, this contagious sickness,\r\nFarewell, all physic. And what follows then?\r\nCommotions, uproars, with a general taint\r\nOf the whole state, as of late days our neighbours,\r\nThe upper Germany, can dearly witness,\r\nYet freshly pitied in our memories.\r\n\r\nCRANMER.\r\nMy good lords, hitherto in all the progress\r\nBoth of my life and office, I have laboured,\r\nAnd with no little study, that my teaching\r\nAnd the strong course of my authority\r\nMight go one way, and safely; and the end\r\nWas ever to do well. Nor is there living—\r\nI speak it with a single heart, my lords—\r\nA man that more detests, more stirs against,\r\nBoth in his private conscience and his place,\r\nDefacers of a public peace than I do.\r\nPray heaven the King may never find a heart\r\nWith less allegiance in it! Men that make\r\nEnvy and crooked malice nourishment\r\nDare bite the best. I do beseech your lordships\r\nThat, in this case of justice, my accusers,\r\nBe what they will, may stand forth face to face\r\nAnd freely urge against me.\r\n\r\nSUFFOLK.\r\nNay, my lord,\r\nThat cannot be. You are a councillor,\r\nAnd by that virtue no man dare accuse you.\r\n\r\nGARDINER.\r\nMy lord, because we have business of more moment,\r\nWe will be short with you. ’Tis his Highness’ pleasure\r\nAnd our consent, for better trial of you,\r\nFrom hence you be committed to the Tower,\r\nWhere, being but a private man again,\r\nYou shall know many dare accuse you boldly—\r\nMore than, I fear, you are provided for.\r\n\r\nCRANMER.\r\nAh, my good Lord of Winchester, I thank you.\r\nYou are always my good friend. If your will pass,\r\nI shall both find your lordship judge and juror,\r\nYou are so merciful. I see your end:\r\n’Tis my undoing. Love and meekness, lord,\r\nBecome a churchman better than ambition.\r\nWin straying souls with modesty again;\r\nCast none away. That I shall clear myself,\r\nLay all the weight ye can upon my patience,\r\nI make as little doubt as you do conscience\r\nIn doing daily wrongs. I could say more,\r\nBut reverence to your calling makes me modest.\r\n\r\nGARDINER.\r\nMy lord, my lord, you are a sectary,\r\nThat’s the plain truth. Your painted gloss discovers,\r\nTo men that understand you, words and weakness.\r\n\r\nCROMWELL.\r\nMy Lord of Winchester, you are a little,\r\nBy your good favour, too sharp. Men so noble,\r\nHowever faulty, yet should find respect\r\nFor what they have been. ’Tis a cruelty\r\nTo load a falling man.\r\n\r\nGARDINER.\r\nGood master secretary,\r\nI cry your honour mercy: you may worst\r\nOf all this table say so.\r\n\r\nCROMWELL.\r\nWhy, my lord?\r\n\r\nGARDINER.\r\nDo not I know you for a favourer\r\nOf this new sect? Ye are not sound.\r\n\r\nCROMWELL.\r\nNot sound?\r\n\r\nGARDINER.\r\nNot sound, I say.\r\n\r\nCROMWELL.\r\nWould you were half so honest!\r\nMen’s prayers then would seek you, not their fears.\r\n\r\nGARDINER.\r\nI shall remember this bold language.\r\n\r\nCROMWELL.\r\nDo.\r\nRemember your bold life too.\r\n\r\nCHANCELLOR.\r\nThis is too much.\r\nForbear, for shame, my lords.\r\n\r\nGARDINER.\r\nI have done.\r\n\r\nCROMWELL.\r\nAnd I.\r\n\r\nCHANCELLOR.\r\nThen thus for you, my lord: it stands agreed,\r\nI take it, by all voices, that forthwith\r\nYou be conveyed to th’ Tower a prisoner,\r\nThere to remain till the King’s further pleasure\r\nBe known unto us. Are you all agreed, lords?\r\n\r\nALL.\r\nWe are.\r\n\r\nCRANMER.\r\nIs there no other way of mercy\r\nBut I must needs to th’ Tower, my lords?\r\n\r\nGARDINER.\r\nWhat other\r\nWould you expect? You are strangely troublesome.\r\nLet some o’ th’ guard be ready there.\r\n\r\nEnter the guard.\r\n\r\nCRANMER.\r\nFor me?\r\nMust I go like a traitor thither?\r\n\r\nGARDINER.\r\nReceive him,\r\nAnd see him safe i’ th’ Tower.\r\n\r\nCRANMER.\r\nStay, good my lords,\r\nI have a little yet to say. Look there, my lords.\r\nBy virtue of that ring, I take my cause\r\nOut of the gripes of cruel men and give it\r\nTo a most noble judge, the King my master.\r\n\r\nCHAMBERLAIN.\r\nThis is the King’s ring.\r\n\r\nSURREY.\r\n’Tis no counterfeit.\r\n\r\nSUFFOLK.\r\n’Tis the right ring, by heaven! I told ye all,\r\nWhen we first put this dangerous stone a-rolling,\r\n’Twould fall upon ourselves.\r\n\r\nNORFOLK.\r\nDo you think, my lords,\r\nThe King will suffer but the little finger\r\nOf this man to be vexed?\r\n\r\nCHAMBERLAIN.\r\n’Tis now too certain.\r\nHow much more is his life in value with him?\r\nWould I were fairly out on’t!\r\n\r\nCROMWELL.\r\nMy mind gave me,\r\nIn seeking tales and informations\r\nAgainst this man, whose honesty the devil\r\nAnd his disciples only envy at,\r\nYe blew the fire that burns ye. Now have at ye!\r\n\r\nEnter King, frowning on them; takes his seat.\r\n\r\nGARDINER.\r\nDread sovereign, how much are we bound to heaven\r\nIn daily thanks, that gave us such a prince,\r\nNot only good and wise, but most religious;\r\nOne that, in all obedience, makes the Church\r\nThe chief aim of his honour and, to strengthen\r\nThat holy duty out of dear respect,\r\nHis royal self in judgement comes to hear\r\nThe cause betwixt her and this great offender.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nYou were ever good at sudden commendations,\r\nBishop of Winchester. But know I come not\r\nTo hear such flattery now, and in my presence\r\nThey are too thin and bare to hide offences.\r\nTo me you cannot reach, you play the spaniel,\r\nAnd think with wagging of your tongue to win me;\r\nBut whatsoe’er thou tak’st me for, I’m sure\r\nThou hast a cruel nature and a bloody.\r\n[_To Cranmer_.] Good man, sit down. Now let me see the proudest\r\nHe, that dares most, but wag his finger at thee.\r\nBy all that’s holy, he had better starve\r\nThan but once think this place becomes thee not.\r\n\r\nSURREY.\r\nMay it please your Grace—\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nNo, sir, it does not please me.\r\nI had thought I had had men of some understanding\r\nAnd wisdom of my Council, but I find none.\r\nWas it discretion, lords, to let this man,\r\nThis good man—few of you deserve that title—\r\nThis honest man, wait like a lousy footboy\r\nAt chamber door? And one as great as you are?\r\nWhy, what a shame was this! Did my commission\r\nBid ye so far forget yourselves? I gave ye\r\nPower as he was a councillor to try him,\r\nNot as a groom. There’s some of ye, I see,\r\nMore out of malice than integrity,\r\nWould try him to the utmost, had ye mean,\r\nWhich ye shall never have while I live.\r\n\r\nCHANCELLOR.\r\nThus far,\r\nMy most dread sovereign, may it like your Grace\r\nTo let my tongue excuse all. What was purposed\r\nConcerning his imprisonment was rather,\r\nIf there be faith in men, meant for his trial\r\nAnd fair purgation to the world than malice,\r\nI’m sure, in me.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nWell, well, my lords, respect him.\r\nTake him, and use him well; he’s worthy of it.\r\nI will say thus much for him: if a prince\r\nMay be beholding to a subject, I\r\nAm, for his love and service, so to him.\r\nMake me no more ado, but all embrace him.\r\nBe friends, for shame, my lords! My Lord of Canterbury,\r\nI have a suit which you must not deny me:\r\nThat is, a fair young maid that yet wants baptism.\r\nYou must be godfather and answer for her.\r\n\r\nCRANMER.\r\nThe greatest monarch now alive may glory\r\nIn such an honour. How may I deserve it,\r\nThat am a poor and humble subject to you?\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nCome, come, my lord, you’d spare your spoons. You shall have two noble\r\npartners with you: the old Duchess of Norfolk and Lady Marquess Dorset.\r\nWill these please you?\r\nOnce more, my Lord of Winchester, I charge you,\r\nEmbrace and love this man.\r\n\r\nGARDINER.\r\nWith a true heart\r\nAnd brother-love I do it.\r\n\r\nCRANMER.\r\nAnd let heaven\r\nWitness how dear I hold this confirmation.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nGood man, those joyful tears show thy true heart.\r\nThe common voice, I see, is verified\r\nOf thee, which says thus: “Do my Lord of Canterbury\r\nA shrewd turn, and he is your friend for ever.”\r\nCome, lords, we trifle time away. I long\r\nTo have this young one made a Christian.\r\nAs I have made ye one, lords, one remain.\r\nSo I grow stronger, you more honour gain.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. The palace yard.\r\n\r\nNoise and tumult within. Enter Porter and his Man.\r\n\r\nPORTER.\r\nYou’ll leave your noise anon, ye rascals. Do you take the court for\r\nParish Garden? Ye rude slaves, leave your gaping.\r\n\r\nONE.\r\n[_Within_.] Good master porter, I belong to th’ larder.\r\n\r\nPORTER.\r\nBelong to th’ gallows, and be hanged, ye rogue! Is this a place to roar\r\nin? Fetch me a dozen crab-tree staves, and strong ones. These are but\r\nswitches to ’em. I’ll scratch your heads. You must be seeing\r\nchristenings? Do you look for ale and cakes here, you rude rascals?\r\n\r\nPORTER’S MAN.\r\nPray, sir, be patient. ’Tis as much impossible—\r\nUnless we sweep ’em from the door with cannons—\r\nTo scatter ’em as ’tis to make ’em sleep\r\nOn May-day morning, which will never be.\r\nWe may as well push against Paul’s as stir ’em.\r\n\r\nPORTER.\r\nHow got they in, and be hanged?\r\n\r\nPORTER’S MAN.\r\nAlas, I know not. How gets the tide in?\r\nAs much as one sound cudgel of four foot—\r\nYou see the poor remainder—could distribute,\r\nI made no spare, sir.\r\n\r\nPORTER.\r\nYou did nothing, sir.\r\n\r\nPORTER’S MAN.\r\nI am not Samson, nor Sir Guy, nor Colbrand,\r\nTo mow ’em down before me; but if I spared any\r\nThat had a head to hit, either young or old,\r\nHe or she, cuckold or cuckold-maker,\r\nLet me ne’er hope to see a chine again—\r\nAnd that I would not for a cow, God save her!\r\n\r\nONE.\r\n[_Within_.] Do you hear, master porter?\r\n\r\nPORTER.\r\nI shall be with you presently, good master puppy.—\r\nKeep the door close, sirrah.\r\n\r\nPORTER’S MAN.\r\nWhat would you have me do?\r\n\r\nPORTER.\r\nWhat should you do, but knock ’em down by th’ dozens? Is this\r\nMoorfields to muster in? Or have we some strange Indian with the great\r\ntool come to court, the women so besiege us? Bless me, what a fry of\r\nfornication is at door! On my Christian conscience, this one\r\nchristening will beget a thousand; here will be father, godfather, and\r\nall together.\r\n\r\nPORTER’S MAN.\r\nThe spoons will be the bigger, sir. There is a fellow somewhat near the\r\ndoor—he should be a brazier by his face, for, o’ my conscience, twenty\r\nof the dog-days now reign in’s nose. All that stand about him are under\r\nthe line; they need no other penance. That fire-drake did I hit three\r\ntimes on the head, and three times was his nose discharged against me.\r\nHe stands there, like a mortar-piece, to blow us. There was a\r\nhaberdasher’s wife of small wit near him that railed upon me till her\r\npinked porringer fell off her head for kindling such a combustion in\r\nthe state. I missed the meteor once and hit that woman, who cried out\r\n“Clubs!” when I might see from far some forty truncheoners draw to her\r\nsuccour, which were the hope o’ th’ Strand, where she was quartered.\r\nThey fell on; I made good my place; at length they came to th’\r\nbroomstaff to me; I defied ’em still, when suddenly a file of boys\r\nbehind ’em, loose shot, delivered such a shower of pebbles that I was\r\nfain to draw mine honour in and let ’em win the work. The devil was\r\namongst ’em, I think, surely.\r\n\r\nPORTER.\r\nThese are the youths that thunder at a playhouse and fight for bitten\r\napples, that no audience but the tribulation of Tower Hill or the limbs\r\nof Limehouse, their dear brothers, are able to endure. I have some of\r\n’em in _Limbo Patrum_, and there they are like to dance these three\r\ndays, besides the running banquet of two beadles that is to come.\r\n\r\nEnter Lord Chamberlain.\r\n\r\nCHAMBERLAIN.\r\nMercy o’ me, what a multitude are here!\r\nThey grow still too. From all parts they are coming,\r\nAs if we kept a fair here! Where are these porters,\r\nThese lazy knaves? You’ve made a fine hand, fellows!\r\nThere’s a trim rabble let in. Are all these\r\nYour faithful friends o’ th’ suburbs? We shall have\r\nGreat store of room, no doubt, left for the ladies,\r\nWhen they pass back from the christening.\r\n\r\nPORTER.\r\nAn’t please your honour,\r\nWe are but men; and what so many may do,\r\nNot being torn a-pieces, we have done.\r\nAn army cannot rule ’em.\r\n\r\nCHAMBERLAIN.\r\nAs I live,\r\nIf the King blame me for’t, I’ll lay ye all\r\nBy th’ heels, and suddenly, and on your heads\r\nClap round fines for neglect. You’re lazy knaves,\r\nAnd here ye lie baiting of bombards, when\r\nYe should do service. Hark, the trumpets sound!\r\nThey’re come already from the christening.\r\nGo break among the press, and find a way out\r\nTo let the troops pass fairly, or I’ll find\r\nA Marshalsea shall hold ye play these two months.\r\n\r\nPORTER.\r\nMake way there for the Princess!\r\n\r\nPORTER’S MAN.\r\nYou great fellow,\r\nStand close up, or I’ll make your head ache.\r\n\r\nPORTER.\r\nYou i’ th’ camlet, get up o’ th’ rail!\r\nI’ll peck you o’er the pales else.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV. The palace.\r\n\r\nEnter Trumpets, sounding; then two Aldermen, Lord Mayor, Garter,\r\nCranmer, Duke of Norfolk with his marshal’s staff, Duke of Suffolk, two\r\nNoblemen bearing great standing bowls for the christening gifts; then\r\nfour Noblemen bearing a canopy, under which the Duchess of Norfolk,\r\ngodmother, bearing the child richly habited in a mantle, etc., train\r\nborne by a Lady; then follows the Marchioness Dorset, the other\r\ngodmother, and Ladies. The troop pass once about the stage, and Garter\r\nspeaks.\r\n\r\nGARTER.\r\nHeaven, from thy endless goodness, send prosperous life, long and ever\r\nhappy, to the high and mighty Princess of England, Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nFlourish. Enter King and Guard.\r\n\r\nCRANMER.\r\n[_Kneeling_.] And to your royal Grace and the good Queen,\r\nMy noble partners and myself thus pray\r\nAll comfort, joy, in this most gracious lady\r\nHeaven ever laid up to make parents happy\r\nMay hourly fall upon ye!\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nThank you, good lord Archbishop.\r\nWhat is her name?\r\n\r\nCRANMER.\r\nElizabeth.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nStand up, lord.\r\n\r\n[_The King kisses the child._]\r\n\r\nWith this kiss take my blessing: God protect thee,\r\nInto whose hand I give thy life.\r\n\r\nCRANMER.\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nMy noble gossips, you’ve have been too prodigal.\r\nI thank ye heartily; so shall this lady,\r\nWhen she has so much English.\r\n\r\nCRANMER.\r\nLet me speak, sir,\r\nFor heaven now bids me; and the words I utter\r\nLet none think flattery, for they’ll find ’em truth.\r\nThis royal infant—heaven still move about her!—\r\nThough in her cradle, yet now promises\r\nUpon this land a thousand thousand blessings,\r\nWhich time shall bring to ripeness. She shall be—\r\nBut few now living can behold that goodness—\r\nA pattern to all princes living with her\r\nAnd all that shall succeed. Saba was never\r\nMore covetous of wisdom and fair virtue\r\nThan this pure soul shall be. All princely graces\r\nThat mould up such a mighty piece as this is,\r\nWith all the virtues that attend the good,\r\nShall still be doubled on her. Truth shall nurse her;\r\nHoly and heavenly thoughts still counsel her.\r\nShe shall be loved and feared. Her own shall bless her;\r\nHer foes shake like a field of beaten corn,\r\nAnd hang their heads with sorrow. Good grows with her.\r\nIn her days every man shall eat in safety\r\nUnder his own vine what he plants, and sing\r\nThe merry songs of peace to all his neighbours.\r\nGod shall be truly known, and those about her\r\nFrom her shall read the perfect ways of honour\r\nAnd by those claim their greatness, not by blood.\r\nNor shall this peace sleep with her; but as when\r\nThe bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix,\r\nHer ashes new create another heir\r\nAs great in admiration as herself,\r\nSo shall she leave her blessedness to one,\r\nWhen heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness,\r\nWho from the sacred ashes of her honour\r\nShall star-like rise as great in fame as she was\r\nAnd so stand fixed. Peace, plenty, love, truth, terror,\r\nThat were the servants to this chosen infant,\r\nShall then be his, and like a vine grow to him.\r\nWherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine,\r\nHis honour and the greatness of his name\r\nShall be, and make new nations. He shall flourish,\r\nAnd, like a mountain cedar, reach his branches\r\nTo all the plains about him. Our children’s children\r\nShall see this and bless heaven.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nThou speakest wonders.\r\n\r\nCRANMER.\r\nShe shall be to the happiness of England\r\nAn aged princess; many days shall see her,\r\nAnd yet no day without a deed to crown it.\r\nWould I had known no more! But she must die,\r\nShe must, the saints must have her; yet a virgin,\r\nA most unspotted lily, shall she pass to the ground,\r\nAnd all the world shall mourn her.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nO lord Archbishop,\r\nThou hast made me now a man. Never before\r\nThis happy child did I get anything.\r\nThis oracle of comfort has so pleased me\r\nThat when I am in heaven I shall desire\r\nTo see what this child does and praise my Maker.\r\nI thank ye all. To you, my good Lord Mayor,\r\nAnd you, good brethren, I am much beholding.\r\nI have received much honour by your presence,\r\nAnd ye shall find me thankful. Lead the way, lords.\r\nYe must all see the Queen, and she must thank ye;\r\nShe will be sick else. This day, no man think\r\n’Has business at his house, for all shall stay.\r\nThis little one shall make it holiday.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nEpilogue\r\n\r\nEnter Epilogue.\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE.\r\n’Tis ten to one this play can never please\r\nAll that are here. Some come to take their ease,\r\nAnd sleep an act or two—but those, we fear,\r\nWe’ve frighted with our trumpets; so, ’tis clear,\r\nThey’ll say ’tis naught—others, to hear the city\r\nAbused extremely and to cry “That’s witty!”—\r\nWhich we have not done neither—that I fear\r\nAll the expected good we’re like to hear\r\nFor this play at this time is only in\r\nThe merciful construction of good women,\r\nFor such a one we showed ’em. If they smile\r\nAnd say ’twill do, I know within a while\r\nAll the best men are ours; for ’tis ill hap\r\nIf they hold when their ladies bid ’em clap.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\nTHE LIFE AND DEATH OF KING JOHN\r\n\nContents\r\n\r\n ACT I\r\n Scene I.

Be thou the trumpet of our wrath\r\nAnd sullen presage of your own decay.—\r\nAn honourable conduct let him have.\r\nPembroke, look to ’t. Farewell, Chatillion.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Chatillion and Pembroke._]\r\n\r\nQUEEN ELEANOR.\r\nWhat now, my son! Have I not ever said\r\nHow that ambitious Constance would not cease\r\nTill she had kindled France and all the world\r\nUpon the right and party of her son?\r\nThis might have been prevented and made whole\r\nWith very easy arguments of love,\r\nWhich now the manage of two kingdoms must\r\nWith fearful bloody issue arbitrate.\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nOur strong possession and our right for us.\r\n\r\nQUEEN ELEANOR.\r\nYour strong possession much more than your right,\r\nOr else it must go wrong with you and me:\r\nSo much my conscience whispers in your ear,\r\nWhich none but heaven and you and I shall hear.\r\n\r\nEnter a Sheriff, who whispers to Essex.\r\n\r\nESSEX.\r\nMy liege, here is the strangest controversy,\r\nCome from the country to be judg’d by you,\r\nThat e’er I heard. Shall I produce the men?\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nLet them approach.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Sheriff._]\r\n\r\nOur abbeys and our priories shall pay\r\nThis expedition’s charge.\r\n\r\nEnter Robert Faulconbridge and Philip, his Bastard brother.\r\n\r\nWhat men are you?\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nYour faithful subject I, a gentleman\r\nBorn in Northamptonshire, and eldest son,\r\nAs I suppose, to Robert Faulconbridge,\r\nA soldier by the honour-giving hand\r\nOf Cœur-de-lion knighted in the field.\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nWhat art thou?\r\n\r\nROBERT.\r\nThe son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nIs that the elder, and art thou the heir?\r\nYou came not of one mother then, it seems.\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nMost certain of one mother, mighty king;\r\nThat is well known; and, as I think, one father.\r\nBut for the certain knowledge of that truth\r\nI put you o’er to heaven and to my mother.\r\nOf that I doubt, as all men’s children may.\r\n\r\nQUEEN ELEANOR.\r\nOut on thee, rude man! Thou dost shame thy mother\r\nAnd wound her honour with this diffidence.\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nI, madam? No, I have no reason for it;\r\nThat is my brother’s plea, and none of mine;\r\nThe which if he can prove, he pops me out\r\nAt least from fair five hundred pound a year.\r\nHeaven guard my mother’s honour and my land!\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nA good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,\r\nDoth he lay claim to thine inheritance?\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nI know not why, except to get the land.\r\nBut once he slander’d me with bastardy.\r\nBut whe’er I be as true begot or no,\r\nThat still I lay upon my mother’s head;\r\nBut that I am as well begot, my liege—\r\nFair fall the bones that took the pains for me!—\r\nCompare our faces and be judge yourself.\r\nIf old Sir Robert did beget us both\r\nAnd were our father, and this son like him,\r\nO old Sir Robert, father, on my knee\r\nI give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nWhy, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!\r\n\r\nQUEEN ELEANOR.\r\nHe hath a trick of Cœur-de-lion’s face;\r\nThe accent of his tongue affecteth him.\r\nDo you not read some tokens of my son\r\nIn the large composition of this man?\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nMine eye hath well examined his parts\r\nAnd finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah, speak,\r\nWhat doth move you to claim your brother’s land?\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nBecause he hath a half-face, like my father.\r\nWith half that face would he have all my land:\r\nA half-fac’d groat five hundred pound a year!\r\n\r\nROBERT.\r\nMy gracious liege, when that my father liv’d,\r\nYour brother did employ my father much—\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nWell, sir, by this you cannot get my land.\r\nYour tale must be how he employ’d my mother.\r\n\r\nROBERT.\r\nAnd once dispatch’d him in an embassy\r\nTo Germany, there with the emperor\r\nTo treat of high affairs touching that time.\r\nTh’ advantage of his absence took the King\r\nAnd in the meantime sojourn’d at my father’s;\r\nWhere how he did prevail I shame to speak;\r\nBut truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores\r\nBetween my father and my mother lay,\r\nAs I have heard my father speak himself,\r\nWhen this same lusty gentleman was got.\r\nUpon his death-bed he by will bequeath’d\r\nHis lands to me, and took it, on his death\r\nThat this my mother’s son was none of his;\r\nAnd if he were, he came into the world\r\nFull fourteen weeks before the course of time.\r\nThen, good my liege, let me have what is mine,\r\nMy father’s land, as was my father’s will.\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nSirrah, your brother is legitimate;\r\nYour father’s wife did after wedlock bear him,\r\nAnd if she did play false, the fault was hers;\r\nWhich fault lies on the hazards of all husbands\r\nThat marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,\r\nWho, as you say, took pains to get this son,\r\nHad of your father claim’d this son for his?\r\nIn sooth, good friend, your father might have kept\r\nThis calf, bred from his cow, from all the world;\r\nIn sooth, he might; then, if he were my brother’s,\r\nMy brother might not claim him; nor your father,\r\nBeing none of his, refuse him. This concludes;\r\nMy mother’s son did get your father’s heir;\r\nYour father’s heir must have your father’s land.\r\n\r\nROBERT.\r\nShall then my father’s will be of no force\r\nTo dispossess that child which is not his?\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nOf no more force to dispossess me, sir,\r\nThan was his will to get me, as I think.\r\n\r\nQUEEN ELEANOR.\r\nWhether hadst thou rather be: a Faulconbridge\r\nAnd like thy brother, to enjoy thy land,\r\nOr the reputed son of Cœur-de-lion,\r\nLord of thy presence and no land besides?\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nMadam, and if my brother had my shape\r\nAnd I had his, Sir Robert’s his, like him;\r\nAnd if my legs were two such riding-rods,\r\nMy arms such eel-skins stuff’d, my face so thin\r\nThat in mine ear I durst not stick a rose\r\nLest men should say “Look where three-farthings goes!”\r\nAnd, to his shape, were heir to all this land,\r\nWould I might never stir from off this place,\r\nI would give it every foot to have this face.\r\nI would not be Sir Nob in any case.\r\n\r\nQUEEN ELEANOR.\r\nI like thee well. Wilt thou forsake thy fortune,\r\nBequeath thy land to him, and follow me?\r\nI am a soldier and now bound to France.\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nBrother, take you my land, I’ll take my chance.\r\nYour face hath got five hundred pound a year,\r\nYet sell your face for five pence and ’tis dear.\r\nMadam, I’ll follow you unto the death.\r\n\r\nQUEEN ELEANOR.\r\nNay, I would have you go before me thither.\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nOur country manners give our betters way.\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nWhat is thy name?\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nPhilip, my liege, so is my name begun;\r\nPhilip, good old Sir Robert’s wife’s eldest son.\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nFrom henceforth bear his name whose form thou bearest.\r\nKneel thou down Philip, but rise more great,\r\nArise Sir Richard and Plantagenet.\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nBrother by th’ mother’s side, give me your hand.\r\nMy father gave me honour, yours gave land.\r\nNow blessed be the hour, by night or day,\r\nWhen I was got, Sir Robert was away!\r\n\r\nQUEEN ELEANOR.\r\nThe very spirit of Plantagenet!\r\nI am thy grandam, Richard; call me so.\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nMadam, by chance but not by truth; what though?\r\nSomething about, a little from the right,\r\nIn at the window, or else o’er the hatch.\r\nWho dares not stir by day must walk by night,\r\nAnd have is have, however men do catch.\r\nNear or far off, well won is still well shot,\r\nAnd I am I, howe’er I was begot.\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nGo, Faulconbridge; now hast thou thy desire.\r\nA landless knight makes thee a landed squire.\r\nCome, madam, and come, Richard, we must speed\r\nFor France, for France, for it is more than need.\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nBrother, adieu, good fortune come to thee!\r\nFor thou wast got i’ th’ way of honesty.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt all but the Bastard._]\r\n\r\nA foot of honour better than I was,\r\nBut many a many foot of land the worse.\r\nWell, now can I make any Joan a lady.\r\n“Good den, Sir Richard!” “God-a-mercy, fellow!”\r\nAnd if his name be George, I’ll call him Peter;\r\nFor new-made honour doth forget men’s names:\r\n’Tis too respective and too sociable\r\nFor your conversion. Now your traveller,\r\nHe and his toothpick at my worship’s mess,\r\nAnd when my knightly stomach is suffic’d,\r\nWhy then I suck my teeth and catechize\r\nMy picked man of countries: “My dear sir,”\r\nThus leaning on mine elbow I begin,\r\n“I shall beseech you”—that is Question now;\r\nAnd then comes Answer like an absey book:\r\n“O sir,” says Answer “at your best command;\r\nAt your employment; at your service, sir.”\r\n“No, sir,” says Question, “I, sweet sir, at yours.”\r\nAnd so, ere Answer knows what Question would,\r\nSaving in dialogue of compliment,\r\nAnd talking of the Alps and Apennines,\r\nThe Pyrenean and the river Po,\r\nIt draws toward supper in conclusion so.\r\nBut this is worshipful society,\r\nAnd fits the mounting spirit like myself;\r\nFor he is but a bastard to the time\r\nThat doth not smack of observation,\r\nAnd so am I, whether I smack or no;\r\nAnd not alone in habit and device,\r\nExterior form, outward accoutrement,\r\nBut from the inward motion to deliver\r\nSweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age’s tooth,\r\nWhich, though I will not practise to deceive,\r\nYet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;\r\nFor it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.\r\nBut who comes in such haste in riding-robes?\r\nWhat woman-post is this? Hath she no husband\r\nThat will take pains to blow a horn before her?\r\n\r\nEnter Lady Faulconbridge and James Gurney.\r\n\r\nO me, ’tis my mother!—How now, good lady?\r\nWhat brings you here to court so hastily?\r\n\r\nLADY FAULCONBRIDGE.\r\nWhere is that slave, thy brother? Where is he\r\nThat holds in chase mine honour up and down?\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nMy brother Robert, old Sir Robert’s son?\r\nColbrand the giant, that same mighty man?\r\nIs it Sir Robert’s son that you seek so?\r\n\r\nLADY FAULCONBRIDGE.\r\nSir Robert’s son! Ay, thou unreverend boy,\r\nSir Robert’s son. Why scorn’st thou at Sir Robert?\r\nHe is Sir Robert’s son, and so art thou.\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nJames Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile?\r\n\r\nGURNEY.\r\nGood leave, good Philip.\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nPhilip?—sparrow!—James,\r\nThere’s toys abroad. Anon I’ll tell thee more.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Gurney._]\r\n\r\nMadam, I was not old Sir Robert’s son.\r\nSir Robert might have eat his part in me\r\nUpon Good Friday, and ne’er broke his fast.\r\nSir Robert could do well—marry, to confess—\r\nCould … get me. Sir Robert could not do it.\r\nWe know his handiwork. Therefore, good mother,\r\nTo whom am I beholding for these limbs?\r\nSir Robert never holp to make this leg.\r\n\r\nLADY FAULCONBRIDGE.\r\nHast thou conspired with thy brother too,\r\nThat for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour?\r\nWhat means this scorn, thou most untoward knave?\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nKnight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.\r\nWhat! I am dubb’d! I have it on my shoulder.\r\nBut, mother, I am not Sir Robert’s son.\r\nI have disclaim’d Sir Robert and my land;\r\nLegitimation, name, and all is gone.\r\nThen, good my mother, let me know my father—\r\nSome proper man, I hope. Who was it, mother?\r\n\r\nLADY FAULCONBRIDGE.\r\nHast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nAs faithfully as I deny the devil.\r\n\r\nLADY FAULCONBRIDGE.\r\nKing Richard Cœur-de-lion was thy father.\r\nBy long and vehement suit I was seduc’d\r\nTo make room for him in my husband’s bed.\r\nHeaven lay not my transgression to my charge!\r\nThou art the issue of my dear offence,\r\nWhich was so strongly urg’d, past my defence.\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nNow, by this light, were I to get again,\r\nMadam, I would not wish a better father.\r\nSome sins do bear their privilege on earth,\r\nAnd so doth yours. Your fault was not your folly.\r\nNeeds must you lay your heart at his dispose,\r\nSubjected tribute to commanding love,\r\nAgainst whose fury and unmatched force\r\nThe aweless lion could not wage the fight,\r\nNor keep his princely heart from Richard’s hand.\r\nHe that perforce robs lions of their hearts\r\nMay easily win a woman’s. Ay, my mother,\r\nWith all my heart I thank thee for my father!\r\nWho lives and dares but say thou didst not well\r\nWhen I was got, I’ll send his soul to hell.\r\nCome, lady, I will show thee to my kin;\r\nAnd they shall say when Richard me begot,\r\nIf thou hadst said him nay, it had been sin.\r\nWho says it was, he lies. I say ’twas not.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\nACT II\r\n\nSCENE I. France.

Lo, upon thy wish,\r\nOur messenger Chatillion is arriv’d.\r\nWhat England says, say briefly, gentle lord;\r\nWe coldly pause for thee; Chatillion, speak.\r\n\r\nCHATILLION.\r\nThen turn your forces from this paltry siege\r\nAnd stir them up against a mightier task.\r\nEngland, impatient of your just demands,\r\nHath put himself in arms.

In the name of God,\r\nHow comes it then that thou art call’d a king,\r\nWhen living blood doth in these temples beat,\r\nWhich owe the crown that thou o’ermasterest?\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nFrom whom hast thou this great commission, France,\r\nTo draw my answer from thy articles?\r\n\r\nKING PHILIP.\r\nFrom that supernal judge that stirs good thoughts\r\nIn any breast of strong authority,\r\nTo look into the blots and stains of right.\r\nThat judge hath made me guardian to this boy,\r\nUnder whose warrant I impeach thy wrong\r\nAnd by whose help I mean to chastise it.\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nAlack, thou dost usurp authority.\r\n\r\nKING PHILIP.\r\nExcuse it is to beat usurping down.\r\n\r\nQUEEN ELEANOR.\r\nWho is it thou dost call usurper, France?\r\n\r\nCONSTANCE.\r\nLet me make answer: thy usurping son.\r\n\r\nQUEEN ELEANOR.\r\nOut, insolent! Thy bastard shall be king,\r\nThat thou mayst be a queen, and check the world!\r\n\r\nCONSTANCE.\r\nMy bed was ever to thy son as true\r\nAs thine was to thy husband; and this boy\r\nLiker in feature to his father Geoffrey\r\nThan thou and John in manners; being as like\r\nAs rain to water, or devil to his dam.\r\nMy boy a bastard! By my soul, I think\r\nHis father never was so true begot:\r\nIt cannot be, and if thou wert his mother.\r\n\r\nQUEEN ELEANOR.\r\nThere’s a good mother, boy, that blots thy father.\r\n\r\nCONSTANCE.\r\nThere’s a good grandam, boy, that would blot thee.\r\n\r\nAUSTRIA.\r\nPeace!\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nHear the crier!\r\n\r\nAUSTRIA.\r\nWhat the devil art thou?\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nOne that will play the devil, sir, with you,\r\nAn he may catch your hide and you alone.\r\nYou are the hare of whom the proverb goes,\r\nWhose valour plucks dead lions by the beard.\r\nI’ll smoke your skin-coat an I catch you right;\r\nSirrah, look to ’t; i’ faith I will, i’ faith.\r\n\r\nBLANCHE.\r\nO, well did he become that lion’s robe\r\nThat did disrobe the lion of that robe!\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nIt lies as sightly on the back of him\r\nAs great Alcides’ shows upon an ass.\r\nBut, ass, I’ll take that burden from your back,\r\nOr lay on that shall make your shoulders crack.\r\n\r\nAUSTRIA.\r\nWhat cracker is this same that deafs our ears\r\nWith this abundance of superfluous breath?\r\n\r\nKING PHILIP.\r\nLouis, determine what we shall do straight.\r\n\r\nLOUIS.\r\nWomen and fools, break off your conference.\r\n\r\nKING PHILIP.\r\nKing John, this is the very sum of all:\r\nEngland and Ireland, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,\r\nIn right of Arthur do I claim of thee.\r\nWilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms?\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nMy life as soon: I do defy thee, France.\r\nArthur of Brittany, yield thee to my hand;\r\nAnd out of my dear love I’ll give thee more\r\nThan e’er the coward hand of France can win.\r\nSubmit thee, boy.\r\n\r\nQUEEN ELEANOR.\r\nCome to thy grandam, child.\r\n\r\nCONSTANCE.\r\nDo, child, go to it grandam, child.\r\nGive grandam kingdom, and it grandam will\r\nGive it a plum, a cherry, and a fig.\r\nThere’s a good grandam.\r\n\r\nARTHUR.\r\nGood my mother, peace!\r\nI would that I were low laid in my grave.\r\nI am not worth this coil that’s made for me.\r\n\r\nQUEEN ELEANOR.\r\nHis mother shames him so, poor boy, he weeps.\r\n\r\nCONSTANCE.\r\nNow, shame upon you, whe’er she does or no!\r\nHis grandam’s wrongs, and not his mother’s shames,\r\nDraws those heaven-moving pearls from his poor eyes,\r\nWhich heaven shall take in nature of a fee.\r\nAy, with these crystal beads heaven shall be brib’d\r\nTo do him justice, and revenge on you.\r\n\r\nQUEEN ELEANOR.\r\nThou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth!\r\n\r\nCONSTANCE.\r\nThou monstrous injurer of heaven and earth!\r\nCall not me slanderer. Thou and thine usurp\r\nThe dominations, royalties, and rights\r\nOf this oppressed boy. This is thy eldest son’s son,\r\nInfortunate in nothing but in thee.\r\nThy sins are visited in this poor child;\r\nThe canon of the law is laid on him,\r\nBeing but the second generation\r\nRemoved from thy sin-conceiving womb.\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nBedlam, have done.\r\n\r\nCONSTANCE.\r\nI have but this to say,\r\nThat he is not only plagued for her sin,\r\nBut God hath made her sin and her the plague\r\nOn this removed issue, plagued for her\r\nAnd with her plague; her sin his injury\r\nHer injury the beadle to her sin,\r\nAll punish’d in the person of this child,\r\nAnd all for her.

A will, a wicked will;\r\nA woman’s will; a cankered grandam’s will!\r\n\r\nKING PHILIP.\r\nPeace, lady! Pause, or be more temperate.\r\nIt ill beseems this presence to cry aim\r\nTo these ill-tuned repetitions.—\r\nSome trumpet summon hither to the walls\r\nThese men of Angiers.

Be pleased then\r\nTo pay that duty which you truly owe\r\nTo him that owes it, namely, this young prince,\r\nAnd then our arms, like to a muzzled bear,\r\nSave in aspect, hath all offence seal’d up;\r\nOur cannons’ malice vainly shall be spent\r\nAgainst th’ invulnerable clouds of heaven;\r\nAnd with a blessed and unvex’d retire,\r\nWith unhack’d swords and helmets all unbruis’d,\r\nWe will bear home that lusty blood again\r\nWhich here we came to spout against your town,\r\nAnd leave your children, wives, and you, in peace.\r\nBut if you fondly pass our proffer’d offer,\r\n’Tis not the roundure of your old-fac’d walls\r\nCan hide you from our messengers of war,\r\nThough all these English, and their discipline\r\nWere harbour’d in their rude circumference.\r\nThen, tell us, shall your city call us lord\r\nIn that behalf which we have challeng’d it?\r\nOr shall we give the signal to our rage\r\nAnd stalk in blood to our possession?\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nIn brief, we are the King of England’s subjects.\r\nFor him, and in his right, we hold this town.\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nAcknowledge then the King, and let me in.\r\n\r\nCITIZEN.\r\nThat can we not; but he that proves the King,\r\nTo him will we prove loyal. Till that time\r\nHave we ramm’d up our gates against the world.\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nDoth not the crown of England prove the King?\r\nAnd if not that, I bring you witnesses,\r\nTwice fifteen thousand hearts of England’s breed—\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nBastards and else.\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nTo verify our title with their lives.\r\n\r\nKING PHILIP.\r\nAs many and as well-born bloods as those—\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nSome bastards too.\r\n\r\nKING PHILIP.\r\nStand in his face to contradict his claim.\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nTill you compound whose right is worthiest,\r\nWe for the worthiest hold the right from both.\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nThen God forgive the sin of all those souls\r\nThat to their everlasting residence,\r\nBefore the dew of evening fall, shall fleet,\r\nIn dreadful trial of our kingdom’s king!\r\n\r\nKING PHILIP.\r\nAmen, Amen!—Mount, chevaliers!

But without this match,\r\nThe sea enraged is not half so deaf,\r\nLions more confident, mountains and rocks\r\nMore free from motion; no, not Death himself\r\nIn mortal fury half so peremptory\r\nAs we to keep this city.\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nHere’s a stay\r\nThat shakes the rotten carcass of old Death\r\nOut of his rags! Here’s a large mouth indeed,\r\nThat spits forth death and mountains, rocks and seas;\r\nTalks as familiarly of roaring lions\r\nAs maids of thirteen do of puppy-dogs!\r\nWhat cannoneer begot this lusty blood?\r\nHe speaks plain cannon, fire, and smoke, and bounce;\r\nHe gives the bastinado with his tongue;\r\nOur ears are cudgell’d; not a word of his\r\nBut buffets better than a fist of France.\r\nZounds!

Look in the lady’s face.\r\n\r\nLOUIS.\r\nI do, my lord, and in her eye I find\r\nA wonder, or a wondrous miracle,\r\nThe shadow of myself form’d in her eye;\r\nWhich, being but the shadow of your son,\r\nBecomes a sun and makes your son a shadow.\r\nI do protest I never lov’d myself\r\nTill now infixed I beheld myself\r\nDrawn in the flattering table of her eye.\r\n\r\n[_Whispers with Blanche._]\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\n[_Aside_.] Drawn in the flattering table of her eye!\r\nHang’d in the frowning wrinkle of her brow,\r\nAnd quarter’d in her heart!

What say you, my niece?\r\n\r\nBLANCHE.\r\nThat she is bound in honour still to do\r\nWhat you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say.\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nSpeak then, Prince Dauphin. Can you love this lady?\r\n\r\nLOUIS.\r\nNay, ask me if I can refrain from love;\r\nFor I do love her most unfeignedly.\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nThen do I give Volquessen, Touraine, Maine,\r\nPoitiers, and Anjou, these five provinces,\r\nWith her to thee; and this addition more,\r\nFull thirty thousand marks of English coin.—\r\nPhilip of France, if thou be pleas’d withal,\r\nCommand thy son and daughter to join hands.\r\n\r\nKING PHILIP.\r\nIt likes us well.—Young princes, close your hands.\r\n\r\nAUSTRIA.\r\nAnd your lips too; for I am well assur’d\r\nThat I did so when I was first assur’d.\r\n\r\nKING PHILIP.\r\nNow, citizens of Angiers, ope your gates,\r\nLet in that amity which you have made;\r\nFor at Saint Mary’s chapel presently\r\nThe rites of marriage shall be solemniz’d.\r\nIs not the Lady Constance in this troop?\r\nI know she is not, for this match made up\r\nHer presence would have interrupted much.\r\nWhere is she and her son? Tell me, who knows.\r\n\r\nLOUIS.\r\nShe is sad and passionate at your highness’ tent.\r\n\r\nKING PHILIP.\r\nAnd, by my faith, this league that we have made\r\nWill give her sadness very little cure.—\r\nBrother of England, how may we content\r\nThis widow lady? In her right we came;\r\nWhich we, God knows, have turn’d another way,\r\nTo our own vantage.\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nWe will heal up all;\r\nFor we’ll create young Arthur Duke of Brittany,\r\nAnd Earl of Richmond; and this rich fair town\r\nWe make him lord of. Call the Lady Constance.\r\nSome speedy messenger bid her repair\r\nTo our solemnity. I trust we shall,\r\nIf not fill up the measure of her will,\r\nYet in some measure satisfy her so\r\nThat we shall stop her exclamation.\r\nGo we, as well as haste will suffer us,\r\nTo this unlook’d-for, unprepared pomp.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt all but the Bastard.

When law can do no right,\r\nLet it be lawful that law bar no wrong.\r\nLaw cannot give my child his kingdom here,\r\nFor he that holds his kingdom holds the law;\r\nTherefore, since law itself is perfect wrong,\r\nHow can the law forbid my tongue to curse?\r\n\r\nPANDULPH.\r\nPhilip of France, on peril of a curse,\r\nLet go the hand of that arch-heretic,\r\nAnd raise the power of France upon his head,\r\nUnless he do submit himself to Rome.\r\n\r\nQUEEN ELEANOR.\r\nLook’st thou pale, France? Do not let go thy hand.\r\n\r\nCONSTANCE\r\nLook to that, devil, lest that France repent\r\nAnd by disjoining hands, hell lose a soul.\r\n\r\nAUSTRIA.\r\nKing Philip, listen to the cardinal.\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nAnd hang a calf’s-skin on his recreant limbs.\r\n\r\nAUSTRIA.\r\nWell, ruffian, I must pocket up these wrongs,\r\nBecause—\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nYour breeches best may carry them.\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nPhilip, what say’st thou to the cardinal?\r\n\r\nCONSTANCE.\r\nWhat should he say, but as the cardinal?\r\n\r\nLOUIS.\r\nBethink you, father; for the difference\r\nIs purchase of a heavy curse from Rome,\r\nOr the light loss of England for a friend.\r\nForgo the easier.\r\n\r\nBLANCHE.\r\nThat’s the curse of Rome.\r\n\r\nCONSTANCE.\r\nO Louis, stand fast! The devil tempts thee here\r\nIn likeness of a new untrimmed bride.\r\n\r\nBLANCHE.\r\nThe Lady Constance speaks not from her faith,\r\nBut from her need.\r\n\r\nCONSTANCE.\r\nO, if thou grant my need,\r\nWhich only lives but by the death of faith,\r\nThat need must needs infer this principle:\r\nThat faith would live again by death of need.\r\nO then tread down my need, and faith mounts up;\r\nKeep my need up, and faith is trodden down!\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nThe King is mov’d, and answers not to this.\r\n\r\nCONSTANCE.\r\nO, be remov’d from him, and answer well!\r\n\r\nAUSTRIA.\r\nDo so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nHang nothing but a calf’s-skin, most sweet lout.\r\n\r\nKING PHILIP.\r\nI am perplex’d, and know not what to say.\r\n\r\nPANDULPH.\r\nWhat canst thou say but will perplex thee more,\r\nIf thou stand excommunicate and curs’d?\r\n\r\nKING PHILIP.\r\nGood reverend father, make my person yours,\r\nAnd tell me how you would bestow yourself.\r\nThis royal hand and mine are newly knit,\r\nAnd the conjunction of our inward souls\r\nMarried in league, coupled and link’d together\r\nWith all religious strength of sacred vows;\r\nThe latest breath that gave the sound of words\r\nWas deep-sworn faith, peace, amity, true love\r\nBetween our kingdoms and our royal selves;\r\nAnd even before this truce, but new before,\r\nNo longer than we well could wash our hands\r\nTo clap this royal bargain up of peace,\r\nHeaven knows, they were besmear’d and overstain’d\r\nWith slaughter’s pencil, where revenge did paint\r\nThe fearful difference of incensed kings.\r\nAnd shall these hands, so lately purg’d of blood,\r\nSo newly join’d in love, so strong in both,\r\nUnyoke this seizure and this kind regreet?\r\nPlay fast and loose with faith? So jest with heaven,\r\nMake such unconstant children of ourselves,\r\nAs now again to snatch our palm from palm,\r\nUnswear faith sworn, and on the marriage-bed\r\nOf smiling peace to march a bloody host,\r\nAnd make a riot on the gentle brow\r\nOf true sincerity? O, holy sir,\r\nMy reverend father, let it not be so!\r\nOut of your grace, devise, ordain, impose\r\nSome gentle order, and then we shall be blest\r\nTo do your pleasure and continue friends.\r\n\r\nPANDULPH.\r\nAll form is formless, order orderless,\r\nSave what is opposite to England’s love.\r\nTherefore to arms! Be champion of our church,\r\nOr let the church, our mother, breathe her curse,\r\nA mother’s curse, on her revolting son.\r\nFrance, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue,\r\nA chafed lion by the mortal paw,\r\nA fasting tiger safer by the tooth,\r\nThan keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold.\r\n\r\nKING PHILIP.\r\nI may disjoin my hand, but not my faith.\r\n\r\nPANDULPH.\r\nSo mak’st thou faith an enemy to faith,\r\nAnd like a civil war sett’st oath to oath,\r\nThy tongue against thy tongue. O, let thy vow\r\nFirst made to heaven, first be to heaven perform’d,\r\nThat is, to be the champion of our church.\r\nWhat since thou swor’st is sworn against thyself\r\nAnd may not be performed by thyself,\r\nFor that which thou hast sworn to do amiss\r\nIs not amiss when it is truly done;\r\nAnd being not done, where doing tends to ill,\r\nThe truth is then most done not doing it.\r\nThe better act of purposes mistook\r\nIs to mistake again; though indirect,\r\nYet indirection thereby grows direct,\r\nAnd falsehood falsehood cures, as fire cools fire\r\nWithin the scorched veins of one new-burn’d.\r\nIt is religion that doth make vows kept,\r\nBut thou hast sworn against religion\r\nBy what thou swear’st against the thing thou swear’st,\r\nAnd mak’st an oath the surety for thy truth\r\nAgainst an oath. The truth thou art unsure\r\nTo swear, swears only not to be forsworn,\r\nElse what a mockery should it be to swear?\r\nBut thou dost swear only to be forsworn,\r\nAnd most forsworn, to keep what thou dost swear.\r\nTherefore thy latter vows against thy first\r\nIs in thyself rebellion to thyself;\r\nAnd better conquest never canst thou make\r\nThan arm thy constant and thy nobler parts\r\nAgainst these giddy loose suggestions,\r\nUpon which better part our prayers come in,\r\nIf thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know\r\nThe peril of our curses light on thee,\r\nSo heavy as thou shalt not shake them off,\r\nBut in despair die under the black weight.\r\n\r\nAUSTRIA.\r\nRebellion, flat rebellion!\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nWill’t not be?\r\nWill not a calf’s-skin stop that mouth of thine?\r\n\r\nLOUIS.\r\nFather, to arms!\r\n\r\nBLANCHE.\r\nUpon thy wedding-day?\r\nAgainst the blood that thou hast married?\r\nWhat, shall our feast be kept with slaughter’d men?\r\nShall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums,\r\nClamours of hell, be measures to our pomp?\r\nO husband, hear me! Ay, alack, how new\r\nIs “husband” in my mouth! Even for that name,\r\nWhich till this time my tongue did ne’er pronounce,\r\nUpon my knee I beg, go not to arms\r\nAgainst mine uncle.\r\n\r\nCONSTANCE.\r\nO, upon my knee,\r\nMade hard with kneeling, I do pray to thee,\r\nThou virtuous Dauphin, alter not the doom\r\nForethought by heaven!\r\n\r\nBLANCHE.\r\nNow shall I see thy love. What motive may\r\nBe stronger with thee than the name of wife?\r\n\r\nCONSTANCE.\r\nThat which upholdeth him that thee upholds,\r\nHis honour. O, thine honour, Louis, thine honour!\r\n\r\nLOUIS.\r\nI muse your majesty doth seem so cold,\r\nWhen such profound respects do pull you on.\r\n\r\nPANDULPH.\r\nI will denounce a curse upon his head.\r\n\r\nKING PHILIP.\r\nThou shalt not need. England, I will fall from thee.\r\n\r\nCONSTANCE.\r\nO fair return of banish’d majesty!\r\n\r\nQUEEN ELEANOR.\r\nO foul revolt of French inconstancy!\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nFrance, thou shalt rue this hour within this hour.\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nOld Time the clock-setter, that bald sexton Time,\r\nIs it as he will? Well, then, France shall rue.\r\n\r\nBLANCHE.\r\nThe sun’s o’ercast with blood. Fair day, adieu!\r\nWhich is the side that I must go withal?\r\nI am with both, each army hath a hand;\r\nAnd in their rage, I having hold of both,\r\nThey whirl asunder and dismember me.\r\nHusband, I cannot pray that thou mayst win;\r\nUncle, I needs must pray that thou mayst lose;\r\nFather, I may not wish the fortune thine;\r\nGrandam, I will not wish thy wishes thrive.\r\nWhoever wins, on that side shall I lose;\r\nAssured loss before the match be play’d.\r\n\r\nLOUIS.\r\nLady, with me, with me thy fortune lies.\r\n\r\nBLANCHE.\r\nThere where my fortune lives, there my life dies.\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nCousin, go draw our puissance together.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Bastard._]\r\n\r\nFrance, I am burn’d up with inflaming wrath;\r\nA rage whose heat hath this condition,\r\nThat nothing can allay, nothing but blood,\r\nThe blood, and dearest-valu’d blood, of France.\r\n\r\nKING PHILIP.\r\nThy rage shall burn thee up, and thou shalt turn\r\nTo ashes, ere our blood shall quench that fire.\r\nLook to thyself, thou art in jeopardy.\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nNo more than he that threats.

O my gentle Hubert,\r\nWe owe thee much! Within this wall of flesh\r\nThere is a soul counts thee her creditor,\r\nAnd with advantage means to pay thy love.\r\nAnd, my good friend, thy voluntary oath\r\nLives in this bosom, dearly cherished.\r\nGive me thy hand. I had a thing to say,\r\nBut I will fit it with some better tune.\r\nBy heaven, Hubert, I am almost asham’d\r\nTo say what good respect I have of thee.\r\n\r\nHUBERT.\r\nI am much bounden to your majesty.\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nGood friend, thou hast no cause to say so yet,\r\nBut thou shalt have; and creep time ne’er so slow,\r\nYet it shall come for me to do thee good.\r\nI had a thing to say, but let it go.\r\nThe sun is in the heaven, and the proud day,\r\nAttended with the pleasures of the world,\r\nIs all too wanton and too full of gauds\r\nTo give me audience. If the midnight bell\r\nDid, with his iron tongue and brazen mouth,\r\nSound on into the drowsy race of night;\r\nIf this same were a churchyard where we stand,\r\nAnd thou possessed with a thousand wrongs;\r\nOr if that surly spirit, melancholy,\r\nHad bak’d thy blood and made it heavy, thick,\r\nWhich else runs tickling up and down the veins,\r\nMaking that idiot, laughter, keep men’s eyes\r\nAnd strain their cheeks to idle merriment,\r\nA passion hateful to my purposes;\r\nOr if that thou couldst see me without eyes,\r\nHear me without thine ears, and make reply\r\nWithout a tongue, using conceit alone,\r\nWithout eyes, ears, and harmful sound of words;\r\nThen, in despite of brooded watchful day,\r\nI would into thy bosom pour my thoughts.\r\nBut, ah, I will not! Yet I love thee well;\r\nAnd, by my troth, I think thou lov’st me well.\r\n\r\nHUBERT.\r\nSo well that what you bid me undertake,\r\nThough that my death were adjunct to my act,\r\nBy heaven, I would do it.\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nDo not I know thou wouldst?\r\nGood Hubert, Hubert, Hubert, throw thine eye\r\nOn yon young boy. I’ll tell thee what, my friend,\r\nHe is a very serpent in my way;\r\nAnd wheresoe’er this foot of mine doth tread,\r\nHe lies before me.

A grave unto a soul;\r\nHolding th’ eternal spirit, against her will,\r\nIn the vile prison of afflicted breath.\r\nI prithee, lady, go away with me.\r\n\r\nCONSTANCE.\r\nLo, now, now see the issue of your peace!\r\n\r\nKING PHILIP.\r\nPatience, good lady! Comfort, gentle Constance!\r\n\r\nCONSTANCE.\r\nNo, I defy all counsel, all redress,\r\nBut that which ends all counsel, true redress,\r\nDeath, death, O amiable, lovely death!\r\nThou odoriferous stench, sound rottenness!\r\nArise forth from the couch of lasting night,\r\nThou hate and terror to prosperity,\r\nAnd I will kiss thy detestable bones\r\nAnd put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows,\r\nAnd ring these fingers with thy household worms,\r\nAnd stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust,\r\nAnd be a carrion monster like thyself.\r\nCome, grin on me, and I will think thou smil’st,\r\nAnd buss thee as thy wife. Misery’s love,\r\nO, come to me!\r\n\r\nKING PHILIP.\r\nO fair affliction, peace!\r\n\r\nCONSTANCE.\r\nNo, no, I will not, having breath to cry.\r\nO, that my tongue were in the thunder’s mouth!\r\nThen with a passion would I shake the world;\r\nAnd rouse from sleep that fell anatomy\r\nWhich cannot hear a lady’s feeble voice,\r\nWhich scorns a modern invocation.\r\n\r\nPANDULPH.\r\nLady, you utter madness, and not sorrow.\r\n\r\nCONSTANCE.\r\nThou art not holy to belie me so.\r\nI am not mad. This hair I tear is mine;\r\nMy name is Constance; I was Geoffrey’s wife;\r\nYoung Arthur is my son, and he is lost.\r\nI am not mad; I would to heaven I were!\r\nFor then ’tis like I should forget myself.\r\nO, if I could, what grief should I forget!\r\nPreach some philosophy to make me mad,\r\nAnd thou shalt be canoniz’d, cardinal;\r\nFor, being not mad but sensible of grief,\r\nMy reasonable part produces reason\r\nHow I may be deliver’d of these woes,\r\nAnd teaches me to kill or hang myself.\r\nIf I were mad, I should forget my son,\r\nOr madly think a babe of clouts were he.\r\nI am not mad; too well, too well I feel\r\nThe different plague of each calamity.\r\n\r\nKING PHILIP.\r\nBind up those tresses. O, what love I note\r\nIn the fair multitude of those her hairs!\r\nWhere but by a chance a silver drop hath fall’n,\r\nEven to that drop ten thousand wiry friends\r\nDo glue themselves in sociable grief,\r\nLike true, inseparable, faithful loves,\r\nSticking together in calamity.\r\n\r\nCONSTANCE.\r\nTo England, if you will.\r\n\r\nKING PHILIP.\r\nBind up your hairs.\r\n\r\nCONSTANCE.\r\nYes, that I will; and wherefore will I do it?\r\nI tore them from their bonds and cried aloud,\r\n“O that these hands could so redeem my son,\r\nAs they have given these hairs their liberty!”\r\nBut now I envy at their liberty,\r\nAnd will again commit them to their bonds,\r\nBecause my poor child is a prisoner.\r\nAnd, father cardinal, I have heard you say\r\nThat we shall see and know our friends in heaven.\r\nIf that be true, I shall see my boy again;\r\nFor since the birth of Cain, the first male child,\r\nTo him that did but yesterday suspire,\r\nThere was not such a gracious creature born.\r\nBut now will canker sorrow eat my bud\r\nAnd chase the native beauty from his cheek,\r\nAnd he will look as hollow as a ghost,\r\nAs dim and meagre as an ague’s fit,\r\nAnd so he’ll die; and, rising so again,\r\nWhen I shall meet him in the court of heaven\r\nI shall not know him. Therefore never, never\r\nMust I behold my pretty Arthur more.\r\n\r\nPANDULPH.\r\nYou hold too heinous a respect of grief.\r\n\r\nCONSTANCE.\r\nHe talks to me that never had a son.\r\n\r\nKING PHILIP.\r\nYou are as fond of grief as of your child.\r\n\r\nCONSTANCE.\r\nGrief fills the room up of my absent child,\r\nLies in his bed, walks up and down with me,\r\nPuts on his pretty looks, repeats his words,\r\nRemembers me of all his gracious parts,\r\nStuffs out his vacant garments with his form;\r\nThen have I reason to be fond of grief?\r\nFare you well. Had you such a loss as I,\r\nI could give better comfort than you do.\r\nI will not keep this form upon my head,\r\n\r\n[_She unbinds her hair._]\r\n\r\nWhen there is such disorder in my wit.\r\nO Lord! My boy, my Arthur, my fair son!\r\nMy life, my joy, my food, my all the world!\r\nMy widow-comfort, and my sorrows’ cure!\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nKING PHILIP.\r\nI fear some outrage, and I’ll follow her.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nLOUIS.\r\nThere’s nothing in this world can make me joy.\r\nLife is as tedious as a twice-told tale\r\nVexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;\r\nAnd bitter shame hath spoil’d the sweet world’s taste,\r\nThat it yields nought but shame and bitterness.\r\n\r\nPANDULPH.\r\nBefore the curing of a strong disease,\r\nEven in the instant of repair and health,\r\nThe fit is strongest; evils that take leave\r\nOn their departure most of all show evil.\r\nWhat have you lost by losing of this day?\r\n\r\nLOUIS.\r\nAll days of glory, joy, and happiness.\r\n\r\nPANDULPH.\r\nIf you had won it, certainly you had.\r\nNo, no; when Fortune means to men most good,\r\nShe looks upon them with a threat’ning eye.\r\n’Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost\r\nIn this which he accounts so clearly won.\r\nAre not you griev’d that Arthur is his prisoner?\r\n\r\nLOUIS.\r\nAs heartily as he is glad he hath him.\r\n\r\nPANDULPH.\r\nYour mind is all as youthful as your blood.\r\nNow hear me speak with a prophetic spirit;\r\nFor even the breath of what I mean to speak\r\nShall blow each dust, each straw, each little rub,\r\nOut of the path which shall directly lead\r\nThy foot to England’s throne; and therefore mark.\r\nJohn hath seiz’d Arthur; and it cannot be\r\nThat, whiles warm life plays in that infant’s veins,\r\nThe misplac’d John should entertain an hour,\r\nOne minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest.\r\nA sceptre snatch’d with an unruly hand\r\nMust be boisterously maintain’d as gain’d.\r\nAnd he that stands upon a slipp’ry place\r\nMakes nice of no vile hold to stay him up.\r\nThat John may stand, then, Arthur needs must fall.\r\nSo be it, for it cannot be but so.\r\n\r\nLOUIS.\r\nBut what shall I gain by young Arthur’s fall?\r\n\r\nPANDULPH.\r\nYou, in the right of Lady Blanche your wife,\r\nMay then make all the claim that Arthur did.\r\n\r\nLOUIS.\r\nAnd lose it, life and all, as Arthur did.\r\n\r\nPANDULPH.\r\nHow green you are and fresh in this old world!\r\nJohn lays you plots; the times conspire with you;\r\nFor he that steeps his safety in true blood\r\nShall find but bloody safety and untrue.\r\nThis act so evilly borne shall cool the hearts\r\nOf all his people, and freeze up their zeal,\r\nThat none so small advantage shall step forth\r\nTo check his reign, but they will cherish it;\r\nNo natural exhalation in the sky,\r\nNo scope of nature, no distemper’d day,\r\nNo common wind, no customed event,\r\nBut they will pluck away his natural cause\r\nAnd call them meteors, prodigies, and signs,\r\nAbortives, presages, and tongues of heaven,\r\nPlainly denouncing vengeance upon John.\r\n\r\nLOUIS.\r\nMaybe he will not touch young Arthur’s life,\r\nBut hold himself safe in his prisonment.\r\n\r\nPANDULPH.\r\nO, sir, when he shall hear of your approach,\r\nIf that young Arthur be not gone already,\r\nEven at that news he dies; and then the hearts\r\nOf all his people shall revolt from him,\r\nAnd kiss the lips of unacquainted change,\r\nAnd pick strong matter of revolt and wrath\r\nOut of the bloody fingers’ ends of John.\r\nMethinks I see this hurly all on foot;\r\nAnd, O, what better matter breeds for you\r\nThan I have nam’d! The bastard Faulconbridge\r\nIs now in England ransacking the church,\r\nOffending charity. If but a dozen French\r\nWere there in arms, they would be as a call\r\nTo train ten thousand English to their side,\r\nOr as a little snow, tumbled about,\r\nAnon becomes a mountain. O noble Dauphin,\r\nGo with me to the King. ’Tis wonderful\r\nWhat may be wrought out of their discontent,\r\nNow that their souls are topful of offence.\r\nFor England go. I will whet on the King.\r\n\r\nLOUIS.\r\nStrong reasons makes strong actions. Let us go.\r\nIf you say ay, the King will not say no.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\nACT IV\r\n\nSCENE I. Northampton.

You are sad.\r\n\r\nHUBERT.\r\nIndeed, I have been merrier.\r\n\r\nARTHUR.\r\nMercy on me!\r\nMethinks nobody should be sad but I.\r\nYet, I remember, when I was in France,\r\nYoung gentlemen would be as sad as night,\r\nOnly for wantonness. By my christendom,\r\nSo I were out of prison, and kept sheep,\r\nI should be as merry as the day is long;\r\nAnd so I would be here, but that I doubt\r\nMy uncle practises more harm to me.\r\nHe is afraid of me, and I of him.\r\nIs it my fault that I was Geoffrey’s son?\r\nNo, indeed, is’t not; and I would to heaven\r\nI were your son, so you would love me, Hubert.\r\n\r\nHUBERT.\r\n[_Aside_.] If I talk to him, with his innocent prate\r\nHe will awake my mercy, which lies dead.\r\nTherefore I will be sudden and dispatch.\r\n\r\nARTHUR.\r\nAre you sick, Hubert? You look pale today.\r\nIn sooth, I would you were a little sick,\r\nThat I might sit all night and watch with you.\r\nI warrant I love you more than you do me.\r\n\r\nHUBERT.\r\n[_Aside_.] His words do take possession of my bosom.\r\nRead here, young Arthur.\r\n\r\n[_Showing a paper._]\r\n\r\n[_Aside_.] How now, foolish rheum!\r\nTurning dispiteous torture out of door!\r\nI must be brief, lest resolution drop\r\nOut at mine eyes in tender womanish tears.—\r\nCan you not read it? Is it not fair writ?\r\n\r\nARTHUR.\r\nToo fairly, Hubert, for so foul effect.\r\nMust you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes?\r\n\r\nHUBERT.\r\nYoung boy, I must.\r\n\r\nARTHUR.\r\nAnd will you?\r\n\r\nHUBERT.\r\nAnd I will.\r\n\r\nARTHUR.\r\nHave you the heart? When your head did but ache,\r\nI knit my handkercher about your brows,\r\nThe best I had, a princess wrought it me,\r\nAnd I did never ask it you again;\r\nAnd with my hand at midnight held your head,\r\nAnd, like the watchful minutes to the hour,\r\nStill and anon cheer’d up the heavy time,\r\nSaying ’What lack you?” and “Where lies your grief?”\r\nOr “What good love may I perform for you?”\r\nMany a poor man’s son would have lien still\r\nAnd ne’er have spoke a loving word to you;\r\nBut you at your sick service had a prince.\r\nNay, you may think my love was crafty love,\r\nAnd call it cunning. Do, an if you will.\r\nIf heaven be pleas’d that you must use me ill,\r\nWhy then you must. Will you put out mine eyes?\r\nThese eyes that never did nor never shall\r\nSo much as frown on you?\r\n\r\nHUBERT.\r\nI have sworn to do it.\r\nAnd with hot irons must I burn them out.\r\n\r\nARTHUR.\r\nAh, none but in this iron age would do it!\r\nThe iron of itself, though heat red-hot,\r\nApproaching near these eyes would drink my tears\r\nAnd quench his fiery indignation\r\nEven in the matter of mine innocence;\r\nNay, after that, consume away in rust,\r\nBut for containing fire to harm mine eye.\r\nAre you more stubborn-hard than hammer’d iron?\r\nAn if an angel should have come to me\r\nAnd told me Hubert should put out mine eyes,\r\nI would not have believ’d him. No tongue but Hubert’s.\r\n\r\nHUBERT.\r\n[_Stamps_.] Come forth.\r\n\r\nEnter Executioners with cords, irons, &c.\r\n\r\nDo as I bid you do.\r\n\r\nARTHUR.\r\nO, save me, Hubert, save me!

Drive these men away,\r\nAnd I will sit as quiet as a lamb;\r\nI will not stir, nor wince, nor speak a word,\r\nNor look upon the iron angerly.\r\nThrust but these men away, and I’ll forgive you,\r\nWhatever torment you do put me to.\r\n\r\nHUBERT.\r\nGo, stand within; let me alone with him.\r\n\r\nFIRST EXECUTIONER.\r\nI am best pleas’d to be from such a deed.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Executioners._]\r\n\r\nARTHUR.\r\nAlas, I then have chid away my friend!\r\nHe hath a stern look but a gentle heart.\r\nLet him come back, that his compassion may\r\nGive life to yours.\r\n\r\nHUBERT.\r\nCome, boy, prepare yourself.\r\n\r\nARTHUR.\r\nIs there no remedy?\r\n\r\nHUBERT.\r\nNone, but to lose your eyes.\r\n\r\nARTHUR.\r\nO heaven, that there were but a mote in yours,\r\nA grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,\r\nAny annoyance in that precious sense!\r\nThen, feeling what small things are boisterous there,\r\nYour vile intent must needs seem horrible.\r\n\r\nHUBERT.\r\nIs this your promise? Go to, hold your tongue.\r\n\r\nARTHUR.\r\nHubert, the utterance of a brace of tongues\r\nMust needs want pleading for a pair of eyes.\r\nLet me not hold my tongue. Let me not, Hubert,\r\nOr, Hubert, if you will, cut out my tongue,\r\nSo I may keep mine eyes. O, spare mine eyes,\r\nThough to no use but still to look on you!\r\nLo, by my troth, the instrument is cold\r\nAnd would not harm me.\r\n\r\nHUBERT.\r\nI can heat it, boy.\r\n\r\nARTHUR.\r\nNo, in good sooth; the fire is dead with grief,\r\nBeing create for comfort, to be us’d\r\nIn undeserv’d extremes. See else yourself.\r\nThere is no malice in this burning coal;\r\nThe breath of heaven hath blown his spirit out\r\nAnd strew’d repentant ashes on his head.\r\n\r\nHUBERT.\r\nBut with my breath I can revive it, boy.\r\n\r\nARTHUR.\r\nAn if you do, you will but make it blush\r\nAnd glow with shame of your proceedings, Hubert.\r\nNay, it perchance will sparkle in your eyes;\r\nAnd, like a dog that is compell’d to fight,\r\nSnatch at his master that doth tarre him on.\r\nAll things that you should use to do me wrong\r\nDeny their office. Only you do lack\r\nThat mercy which fierce fire and iron extends,\r\nCreatures of note for mercy-lacking uses.\r\n\r\nHUBERT.\r\nWell, see to live; I will not touch thine eye\r\nFor all the treasure that thine uncle owes.\r\nYet I am sworn, and I did purpose, boy,\r\nWith this same very iron to burn them out.\r\n\r\nARTHUR.\r\nO, now you look like Hubert! All this while\r\nYou were disguised.\r\n\r\nHUBERT.\r\nPeace; no more. Adieu.\r\nYour uncle must not know but you are dead.\r\nI’ll fill these dogged spies with false reports.\r\nAnd, pretty child, sleep doubtless and secure\r\nThat Hubert, for the wealth of all the world,\r\nWill not offend thee.\r\n\r\nARTHUR.\r\nO heaven! I thank you, Hubert.\r\n\r\nHUBERT.\r\nSilence; no more. Go closely in with me.\r\nMuch danger do I undergo for thee.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. The same. A Room of State in the Palace.\r\n\r\nEnter King John, crowned, Pembroke, Salisbury and other Lords. The King\r\ntakes his State.\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nHere once again we sit, once again crown’d,\r\nAnd look’d upon, I hope, with cheerful eyes.\r\n\r\nPEMBROKE.\r\nThis “once again,” but that your highness pleas’d,\r\nWas once superfluous. You were crown’d before,\r\nAnd that high royalty was ne’er pluck’d off,\r\nThe faiths of men ne’er stained with revolt;\r\nFresh expectation troubled not the land\r\nWith any long’d-for change or better state.\r\n\r\nSALISBURY.\r\nTherefore, to be possess’d with double pomp,\r\nTo guard a title that was rich before,\r\nTo gild refined gold, to paint the lily,\r\nTo throw a perfume on the violet,\r\nTo smooth the ice, or add another hue\r\nUnto the rainbow, or with taper-light\r\nTo seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,\r\nIs wasteful and ridiculous excess.\r\n\r\nPEMBROKE.\r\nBut that your royal pleasure must be done,\r\nThis act is as an ancient tale new told,\r\nAnd, in the last repeating, troublesome,\r\nBeing urged at a time unseasonable.\r\n\r\nSALISBURY.\r\nIn this the antique and well-noted face\r\nOf plain old form is much disfigured;\r\nAnd, like a shifted wind unto a sail,\r\nIt makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,\r\nStartles and frights consideration,\r\nMakes sound opinion sick and truth suspected,\r\nFor putting on so new a fashion’d robe.\r\n\r\nPEMBROKE.\r\nWhen workmen strive to do better than well,\r\nThey do confound their skill in covetousness;\r\nAnd oftentimes excusing of a fault\r\nDoth make the fault the worse by the excuse,\r\nAs patches set upon a little breach\r\nDiscredit more in hiding of the fault\r\nThan did the fault before it was so patch’d.\r\n\r\nSALISBURY.\r\nTo this effect, before you were new-crown’d,\r\nWe breath’d our counsel; but it pleas’d your highness\r\nTo overbear it, and we are all well pleas’d,\r\nSince all and every part of what we would\r\nDoth make a stand at what your highness will.\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nSome reasons of this double coronation\r\nI have possess’d you with, and think them strong;\r\nAnd more, more strong, when lesser is my fear,\r\nI shall indue you with. Meantime but ask\r\nWhat you would have reform’d that is not well,\r\nAnd well shall you perceive how willingly\r\nI will both hear and grant you your requests.\r\n\r\nPEMBROKE.\r\nThen I, as one that am the tongue of these,\r\nTo sound the purposes of all their hearts,\r\nBoth for myself and them, but, chief of all,\r\nYour safety, for the which myself and them\r\nBend their best studies, heartily request\r\nTh’ enfranchisement of Arthur, whose restraint\r\nDoth move the murmuring lips of discontent\r\nTo break into this dangerous argument:\r\nIf what in rest you have in right you hold,\r\nWhy then your fears, which, as they say, attend\r\nThe steps of wrong, should move you to mew up\r\nYour tender kinsman, and to choke his days\r\nWith barbarous ignorance, and deny his youth\r\nThe rich advantage of good exercise?\r\nThat the time’s enemies may not have this\r\nTo grace occasions, let it be our suit\r\nThat you have bid us ask his liberty;\r\nWhich for our goods we do no further ask\r\nThan whereupon our weal, on you depending,\r\nCounts it your weal he have his liberty.\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nLet it be so. I do commit his youth\r\nTo your direction.\r\n\r\nEnter Hubert.\r\n\r\nHubert, what news with you?\r\n\r\n[_Taking him apart._]\r\n\r\nPEMBROKE.\r\nThis is the man should do the bloody deed.\r\nHe show’d his warrant to a friend of mine.\r\nThe image of a wicked heinous fault\r\nLives in his eye; that close aspect of his\r\nDoth show the mood of a much troubled breast;\r\nAnd I do fearfully believe ’tis done\r\nWhat we so fear’d he had a charge to do.\r\n\r\nSALISBURY.\r\nThe colour of the King doth come and go\r\nBetween his purpose and his conscience,\r\nLike heralds ’twixt two dreadful battles set.\r\nHis passion is so ripe it needs must break.\r\n\r\nPEMBROKE.\r\nAnd when it breaks, I fear will issue thence\r\nThe foul corruption of a sweet child’s death.\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nWe cannot hold mortality’s strong hand.\r\nGood lords, although my will to give is living,\r\nThe suit which you demand is gone and dead.\r\nHe tells us Arthur is deceas’d tonight.\r\n\r\nSALISBURY.\r\nIndeed, we fear’d his sickness was past cure.\r\n\r\nPEMBROKE.\r\nIndeed, we heard how near his death he was,\r\nBefore the child himself felt he was sick.\r\nThis must be answer’d either here or hence.\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nWhy do you bend such solemn brows on me?\r\nThink you I bear the shears of destiny?\r\nHave I commandment on the pulse of life?\r\n\r\nSALISBURY.\r\nIt is apparent foul-play; and ’tis shame\r\nThat greatness should so grossly offer it.\r\nSo thrive it in your game, and so, farewell.\r\n\r\nPEMBROKE.\r\nStay yet, Lord Salisbury. I’ll go with thee\r\nAnd find th’ inheritance of this poor child,\r\nHis little kingdom of a forced grave.\r\nThat blood which ow’d the breadth of all this isle\r\nThree foot of it doth hold. Bad world the while!\r\nThis must not be thus borne; this will break out\r\nTo all our sorrows, and ere long, I doubt.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Lords._]\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nThey burn in indignation. I repent.\r\nThere is no sure foundation set on blood,\r\nNo certain life achiev’d by others’ death.\r\n\r\nEnter a Messenger.\r\n\r\nA fearful eye thou hast. Where is that blood\r\nThat I have seen inhabit in those cheeks?\r\nSo foul a sky clears not without a storm.\r\nPour down thy weather: how goes all in France?\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nFrom France to England. Never such a power\r\nFor any foreign preparation\r\nWas levied in the body of a land.\r\nThe copy of your speed is learn’d by them;\r\nFor when you should be told they do prepare,\r\nThe tidings comes that they are all arriv’d.\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nO, where hath our intelligence been drunk?\r\nWhere hath it slept? Where is my mother’s care,\r\nThat such an army could be drawn in France,\r\nAnd she not hear of it?\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nMy liege, her ear\r\nIs stopp’d with dust. The first of April died\r\nYour noble mother; and as I hear, my lord,\r\nThe Lady Constance in a frenzy died\r\nThree days before. But this from rumour’s tongue\r\nI idly heard; if true or false I know not.\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nWithhold thy speed, dreadful occasion!\r\nO, make a league with me, till I have pleas’d\r\nMy discontented peers! What!

Do not seek to stuff\r\nMy head with more ill news, for it is full.\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nBut if you be afeard to hear the worst,\r\nThen let the worst, unheard, fall on your head.\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nBear with me, cousin, for I was amaz’d\r\nUnder the tide, but now I breathe again\r\nAloft the flood, and can give audience\r\nTo any tongue, speak it of what it will.\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nHow I have sped among the clergymen\r\nThe sums I have collected shall express.\r\nBut as I travaill’d hither through the land,\r\nI find the people strangely fantasied;\r\nPossess’d with rumours, full of idle dreams,\r\nNot knowing what they fear, but full of fear.\r\nAnd here’s a prophet that I brought with me\r\nFrom forth the streets of Pomfret, whom I found\r\nWith many hundreds treading on his heels;\r\nTo whom he sung, in rude harsh-sounding rhymes,\r\nThat, ere the next Ascension-day at noon,\r\nYour highness should deliver up your crown.\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nThou idle dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?\r\n\r\nPETER OF POMFRET.\r\nForeknowing that the truth will fall out so.\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nHubert, away with him; imprison him.\r\nAnd on that day at noon, whereon he says\r\nI shall yield up my crown, let him be hang’d.\r\nDeliver him to safety, and return,\r\nFor I must use thee.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Hubert with Peter._]\r\n\r\nO my gentle cousin,\r\nHear’st thou the news abroad, who are arriv’d?\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nThe French, my lord.

I had a mighty cause\r\nTo wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him.\r\n\r\nHUBERT.\r\nNo had, my lord! Why, did you not provoke me?\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nIt is the curse of kings to be attended\r\nBy slaves that take their humours for a warrant\r\nTo break within the bloody house of life,\r\nAnd, on the winking of authority\r\nTo understand a law, to know the meaning\r\nOf dangerous majesty, when perchance it frowns\r\nMore upon humour than advis’d respect.\r\n\r\nHUBERT.\r\nHere is your hand and seal for what I did.\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nO, when the last account ’twixt heaven and earth\r\nIs to be made, then shall this hand and seal\r\nWitness against us to damnation!\r\nHow oft the sight of means to do ill deeds\r\nMake deeds ill done!

This hand of mine\r\nIs yet a maiden and an innocent hand,\r\nNot painted with the crimson spots of blood.\r\nWithin this bosom never enter’d yet\r\nThe dreadful motion of a murderous thought;\r\nAnd you have slander’d nature in my form,\r\nWhich, howsoever rude exteriorly,\r\nIs yet the cover of a fairer mind\r\nThan to be butcher of an innocent child.\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nDoth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers,\r\nThrow this report on their incensed rage,\r\nAnd make them tame to their obedience!\r\nForgive the comment that my passion made\r\nUpon thy feature; for my rage was blind,\r\nAnd foul imaginary eyes of blood\r\nPresented thee more hideous than thou art.\r\nO, answer not, but to my closet bring\r\nThe angry lords with all expedient haste.\r\nI conjure thee but slowly; run more fast.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III.

What is that peace to me?\r\nI, by the honour of my marriage-bed,\r\nAfter young Arthur, claim this land for mine;\r\nAnd, now it is half-conquer’d, must I back\r\nBecause that John hath made his peace with Rome?\r\nAm I Rome’s slave? What penny hath Rome borne,\r\nWhat men provided, what munition sent,\r\nTo underprop this action? Is’t not I\r\nThat undergo this charge? Who else but I,\r\nAnd such as to my claim are liable,\r\nSweat in this business and maintain this war?\r\nHave I not heard these islanders shout out\r\n_Vive le Roi!_ as I have bank’d their towns?\r\nHave I not here the best cards for the game\r\nTo win this easy match play’d for a crown?\r\nAnd shall I now give o’er the yielded set?\r\nNo, no, on my soul, it never shall be said.\r\n\r\nPANDULPH.\r\nYou look but on the outside of this work.\r\n\r\nLOUIS.\r\nOutside or inside, I will not return\r\nTill my attempt so much be glorified\r\nAs to my ample hope was promised\r\nBefore I drew this gallant head of war,\r\nAnd cull’d these fiery spirits from the world,\r\nTo outlook conquest and to win renown\r\nEven in the jaws of danger and of death.\r\n\r\n[_Trumpet sounds._]\r\n\r\nWhat lusty trumpet thus doth summon us?\r\n\r\nEnter the Bastard, attended.\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nAccording to the fair play of the world,\r\nLet me have audience; I am sent to speak,\r\nMy holy lord of Milan, from the King\r\nI come to learn how you have dealt for him;\r\nAnd, as you answer, I do know the scope\r\nAnd warrant limited unto my tongue.\r\n\r\nPANDULPH.\r\nThe Dauphin is too wilful-opposite,\r\nAnd will not temporize with my entreaties;\r\nHe flatly says he’ll not lay down his arms.\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nBy all the blood that ever fury breath’d,\r\nThe youth says well. Now hear our English king,\r\nFor thus his royalty doth speak in me:\r\nHe is prepar’d, and reason too he should.\r\nThis apish and unmannerly approach,\r\nThis harness’d masque and unadvised revel,\r\nThis unhair’d sauciness and boyish troops,\r\nThe King doth smile at; and is well prepar’d\r\nTo whip this dwarfish war, these pigmy arms,\r\nFrom out the circle of his territories.\r\nThat hand which had the strength, even at your door,\r\nTo cudgel you and make you take the hatch,\r\nTo dive like buckets in concealed wells,\r\nTo crouch in litter of your stable planks,\r\nTo lie like pawns lock’d up in chests and trunks,\r\nTo hug with swine, to seek sweet safety out\r\nIn vaults and prisons, and to thrill and shake\r\nEven at the crying of your nation’s crow,\r\nThinking this voice an armed Englishman;\r\nShall that victorious hand be feebled here\r\nThat in your chambers gave you chastisement?\r\nNo! Know the gallant monarch is in arms\r\nAnd like an eagle o’er his aery towers\r\nTo souse annoyance that comes near his nest.—\r\nAnd you degenerate, you ingrate revolts,\r\nYou bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb\r\nOf your dear mother England, blush for shame!\r\nFor your own ladies and pale-visag’d maids\r\nLike Amazons come tripping after drums,\r\nTheir thimbles into armed gauntlets change,\r\nTheir needles to lances, and their gentle hearts\r\nTo fierce and bloody inclination.\r\n\r\nLOUIS.\r\nThere end thy brave, and turn thy face in peace;\r\nWe grant thou canst outscold us. Fare thee well;\r\nWe hold our time too precious to be spent\r\nWith such a brabbler.\r\n\r\nPANDULPH.\r\nGive me leave to speak.\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nNo, I will speak.\r\n\r\nLOUIS.\r\nWe will attend to neither.\r\nStrike up the drums; and let the tongue of war,\r\nPlead for our interest and our being here.\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nIndeed, your drums, being beaten, will cry out;\r\nAnd so shall you, being beaten. Do but start\r\nAnd echo with the clamour of thy drum,\r\nAnd even at hand a drum is ready brac’d\r\nThat shall reverberate all as loud as thine.\r\nSound but another, and another shall,\r\nAs loud as thine, rattle the welkin’s ear\r\nAnd mock the deep-mouth’d thunder. For at hand,\r\nNot trusting to this halting legate here,\r\nWhom he hath us’d rather for sport than need,\r\nIs warlike John; and in his forehead sits\r\nA bare-ribb’d death, whose office is this day\r\nTo feast upon whole thousands of the French.\r\n\r\nLOUIS.\r\nStrike up our drums, to find this danger out.\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nAnd thou shalt find it, Dauphin, do not doubt.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III.

Thus hath he sworn,\r\nAnd I with him, and many more with me,\r\nUpon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury;\r\nEven on that altar where we swore to you\r\nDear amity and everlasting love.\r\n\r\nSALISBURY.\r\nMay this be possible? May this be true?\r\n\r\nMELUN.\r\nHave I not hideous death within my view,\r\nRetaining but a quantity of life,\r\nWhich bleeds away even as a form of wax\r\nResolveth from his figure ’gainst the fire?\r\nWhat in the world should make me now deceive,\r\nSince I must lose the use of all deceit?\r\nWhy should I then be false, since it is true\r\nThat I must die here and live hence by truth?\r\nI say again, if Louis do win the day,\r\nHe is forsworn if e’er those eyes of yours\r\nBehold another day break in the east.\r\nBut even this night, whose black contagious breath\r\nAlready smokes about the burning crest\r\nOf the old, feeble, and day-wearied sun,\r\nEven this ill night, your breathing shall expire,\r\nPaying the fine of rated treachery\r\nEven with a treacherous fine of all your lives,\r\nIf Louis by your assistance win the day.\r\nCommend me to one Hubert, with your king;\r\nThe love of him, and this respect besides,\r\nFor that my grandsire was an Englishman,\r\nAwakes my conscience to confess all this.\r\nIn lieu whereof, I pray you, bear me hence\r\nFrom forth the noise and rumour of the field,\r\nWhere I may think the remnant of my thoughts\r\nIn peace, and part this body and my soul\r\nWith contemplation and devout desires.\r\n\r\nSALISBURY.\r\nWe do believe thee, and beshrew my soul\r\nBut I do love the favour and the form\r\nOf this most fair occasion, by the which\r\nWe will untread the steps of damned flight,\r\nAnd like a bated and retired flood,\r\nLeaving our rankness and irregular course,\r\nStoop low within those bounds we have o’erlook’d,\r\nAnd calmly run on in obedience\r\nEven to our ocean, to our great King John.\r\nMy arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence;\r\nFor I do see the cruel pangs of death\r\nRight in thine eye.—Away, my friends!

Who did taste to him?\r\n\r\nHUBERT.\r\nA monk, I tell you, a resolved villain,\r\nWhose bowels suddenly burst out. The King\r\nYet speaks, and peradventure may recover.\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nWho didst thou leave to tend his majesty?\r\n\r\nHUBERT.\r\nWhy, know you not?

I do not ask you much,\r\nI beg cold comfort; and you are so strait,\r\nAnd so ingrateful, you deny me that.\r\n\r\nPRINCE HENRY.\r\nO, that there were some virtue in my tears\r\nThat might relieve you!\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nThe salt in them is hot.\r\nWithin me is a hell; and there the poison\r\nIs, as a fiend, confin’d to tyrannize\r\nOn unreprievable condemned blood.\r\n\r\nEnter the Bastard.\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nO, I am scalded with my violent motion\r\nAnd spleen of speed to see your majesty!\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\r\nO cousin, thou art come to set mine eye.\r\nThe tackle of my heart is crack’d and burn’d,\r\nAnd all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail\r\nAre turned to one thread, one little hair.\r\nMy heart hath one poor string to stay it by,\r\nWhich holds but till thy news be uttered;\r\nAnd then all this thou seest is but a clod\r\nAnd module of confounded royalty.\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nThe Dauphin is preparing hitherward,\r\nWhere God He knows how we shall answer him;\r\nFor in a night the best part of my power,\r\nAs I upon advantage did remove,\r\nWere in the Washes all unwarily\r\nDevoured by the unexpected flood.\r\n\r\n[_The King dies._]\r\n\r\nSALISBURY.\r\nYou breathe these dead news in as dead an ear.\r\nMy liege!

I do but stay behind\r\nTo do the office for thee of revenge,\r\nAnd then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven,\r\nAs it on earth hath been thy servant still.\r\nNow, now, you stars that move in your right spheres,\r\nWhere be your powers? Show now your mended faiths,\r\nAnd instantly return with me again,\r\nTo push destruction and perpetual shame\r\nOut of the weak door of our fainting land.\r\nStraight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought;\r\nThe Dauphin rages at our very heels.\r\n\r\nSALISBURY.\r\nIt seems you know not, then, so much as we.\r\nThe Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest,\r\nWho half an hour since came from the Dauphin,\r\nAnd brings from him such offers of our peace\r\nAs we with honour and respect may take,\r\nWith purpose presently to leave this war.\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nHe will the rather do it when he sees\r\nOurselves well sinewed to our defence.\r\n\r\nSALISBURY.\r\nNay, ’tis in a manner done already,\r\nFor many carriages he hath dispatch’d\r\nTo the sea-side, and put his cause and quarrel\r\nTo the disposing of the cardinal,\r\nWith whom yourself, myself, and other lords,\r\nIf you think meet, this afternoon will post\r\nTo consummate this business happily.\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nLet it be so. And you, my noble prince,\r\nWith other princes that may best be spar’d,\r\nShall wait upon your father’s funeral.\r\n\r\nPRINCE HENRY.\r\nAt Worcester must his body be interr’d;\r\nFor so he will’d it.\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nThither shall it, then,\r\nAnd happily may your sweet self put on\r\nThe lineal state and glory of the land!\r\nTo whom, with all submission, on my knee,\r\nI do bequeath my faithful services\r\nAnd true subjection everlastingly.\r\n\r\nSALISBURY.\r\nAnd the like tender of our love we make,\r\nTo rest without a spot for evermore.\r\n\r\nPRINCE HENRY.\r\nI have a kind soul that would give you thanks\r\nAnd knows not how to do it but with tears.\r\n\r\nBASTARD.\r\nO, let us pay the time but needful woe,\r\nSince it hath been beforehand with our griefs.\r\nThis England never did, nor never shall,\r\nLie at the proud foot of a conqueror,\r\nBut when it first did help to wound itself.\r\nNow these her princes are come home again,\r\nCome the three corners of the world in arms\r\nAnd we shall shock them.

Caesar speaks.\r\n\r\n[_Music ceases._]\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nCalphurnia.\r\n\r\nCALPHURNIA.\r\nHere, my lord.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nStand you directly in Antonius’ way,\r\nWhen he doth run his course. Antonius.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nCaesar, my lord?\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nForget not in your speed, Antonius,\r\nTo touch Calphurnia; for our elders say,\r\nThe barren, touched in this holy chase,\r\nShake off their sterile curse.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nI shall remember.\r\nWhen Caesar says “Do this,” it is perform’d.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nSet on; and leave no ceremony out.\r\n\r\n[_Music._]\r\n\r\nSOOTHSAYER.\r\nCaesar!\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nHa! Who calls?\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nBid every noise be still; peace yet again!\r\n\r\n[_Music ceases._]\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nWho is it in the press that calls on me?\r\nI hear a tongue shriller than all the music,\r\nCry “Caesar”! Speak. Caesar is turn’d to hear.\r\n\r\nSOOTHSAYER.\r\nBeware the Ides of March.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nWhat man is that?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nA soothsayer bids you beware the Ides of March.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nSet him before me; let me see his face.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nFellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nWhat say’st thou to me now? Speak once again.\r\n\r\nSOOTHSAYER.\r\nBeware the Ides of March.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nHe is a dreamer; let us leave him. Pass.\r\n\r\n[_Sennet. Exeunt all but Brutus and Cassius._]\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nWill you go see the order of the course?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nNot I.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nI pray you, do.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nI am not gamesome: I do lack some part\r\nOf that quick spirit that is in Antony.\r\nLet me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;\r\nI’ll leave you.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nBrutus, I do observe you now of late:\r\nI have not from your eyes that gentleness\r\nAnd show of love as I was wont to have.\r\nYou bear too stubborn and too strange a hand\r\nOver your friend that loves you.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nCassius,\r\nBe not deceived: if I have veil’d my look,\r\nI turn the trouble of my countenance\r\nMerely upon myself. Vexed I am\r\nOf late with passions of some difference,\r\nConceptions only proper to myself,\r\nWhich give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;\r\nBut let not therefore my good friends be grieved\r\n(Among which number, Cassius, be you one)\r\nNor construe any further my neglect,\r\nThan that poor Brutus, with himself at war,\r\nForgets the shows of love to other men.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nThen, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;\r\nBy means whereof this breast of mine hath buried\r\nThoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.\r\nTell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nNo, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself\r\nBut by reflection, by some other thing.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\n’Tis just:\r\nAnd it is very much lamented, Brutus,\r\nThat you have no such mirrors as will turn\r\nYour hidden worthiness into your eye,\r\nThat you might see your shadow. I have heard\r\nWhere many of the best respect in Rome,\r\n(Except immortal Caesar) speaking of Brutus,\r\nAnd groaning underneath this age’s yoke,\r\nHave wish’d that noble Brutus had his eyes.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nInto what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,\r\nThat you would have me seek into myself\r\nFor that which is not in me?\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nTherefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear;\r\nAnd since you know you cannot see yourself\r\nSo well as by reflection, I, your glass,\r\nWill modestly discover to yourself\r\nThat of yourself which you yet know not of.\r\nAnd be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:\r\nWere I a common laugher, or did use\r\nTo stale with ordinary oaths my love\r\nTo every new protester; if you know\r\nThat I do fawn on men, and hug them hard,\r\nAnd after scandal them; or if you know\r\nThat I profess myself in banqueting,\r\nTo all the rout, then hold me dangerous.\r\n\r\n[_Flourish and shout._]\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nWhat means this shouting? I do fear the people\r\nChoose Caesar for their king.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nAy, do you fear it?\r\nThen must I think you would not have it so.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nI would not, Cassius; yet I love him well,\r\nBut wherefore do you hold me here so long?\r\nWhat is it that you would impart to me?\r\nIf it be aught toward the general good,\r\nSet honour in one eye and death i’ the other,\r\nAnd I will look on both indifferently;\r\nFor let the gods so speed me as I love\r\nThe name of honour more than I fear death.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nI know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,\r\nAs well as I do know your outward favour.\r\nWell, honour is the subject of my story.\r\nI cannot tell what you and other men\r\nThink of this life; but, for my single self,\r\nI had as lief not be as live to be\r\nIn awe of such a thing as I myself.\r\nI was born free as Caesar; so were you;\r\nWe both have fed as well, and we can both\r\nEndure the winter’s cold as well as he:\r\nFor once, upon a raw and gusty day,\r\nThe troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,\r\nCaesar said to me, “Dar’st thou, Cassius, now\r\nLeap in with me into this angry flood,\r\nAnd swim to yonder point?” Upon the word,\r\nAccoutred as I was, I plunged in,\r\nAnd bade him follow: so indeed he did.\r\nThe torrent roar’d, and we did buffet it\r\nWith lusty sinews, throwing it aside\r\nAnd stemming it with hearts of controversy.\r\nBut ere we could arrive the point propos’d,\r\nCaesar cried, “Help me, Cassius, or I sink!”\r\nI, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,\r\nDid from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder\r\nThe old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber\r\nDid I the tired Caesar. And this man\r\nIs now become a god; and Cassius is\r\nA wretched creature, and must bend his body,\r\nIf Caesar carelessly but nod on him.\r\nHe had a fever when he was in Spain,\r\nAnd when the fit was on him I did mark\r\nHow he did shake: ’tis true, this god did shake:\r\nHis coward lips did from their colour fly,\r\nAnd that same eye whose bend doth awe the world\r\nDid lose his lustre. I did hear him groan:\r\nAy, and that tongue of his, that bade the Romans\r\nMark him, and write his speeches in their books,\r\nAlas, it cried, “Give me some drink, Titinius,”\r\nAs a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me,\r\nA man of such a feeble temper should\r\nSo get the start of the majestic world,\r\nAnd bear the palm alone.\r\n\r\n[_Shout. Flourish._]\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nAnother general shout?\r\nI do believe that these applauses are\r\nFor some new honours that are heap’d on Caesar.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nWhy, man, he doth bestride the narrow world\r\nLike a Colossus, and we petty men\r\nWalk under his huge legs, and peep about\r\nTo find ourselves dishonourable graves.\r\nMen at some time are masters of their fates:\r\nThe fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,\r\nBut in ourselves, that we are underlings.\r\n“Brutus” and “Caesar”: what should be in that “Caesar”?\r\nWhy should that name be sounded more than yours?\r\nWrite them together, yours is as fair a name;\r\nSound them, it doth become the mouth as well;\r\nWeigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with ’em,\r\n“Brutus” will start a spirit as soon as “Caesar.”\r\nNow in the names of all the gods at once,\r\nUpon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,\r\nThat he is grown so great? Age, thou art sham’d!\r\nRome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!\r\nWhen went there by an age since the great flood,\r\nBut it was fam’d with more than with one man?\r\nWhen could they say, till now, that talk’d of Rome,\r\nThat her wide walls encompass’d but one man?\r\nNow is it Rome indeed, and room enough,\r\nWhen there is in it but one only man.\r\nO, you and I have heard our fathers say,\r\nThere was a Brutus once that would have brook’d\r\nTh’ eternal devil to keep his state in Rome,\r\nAs easily as a king!\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nThat you do love me, I am nothing jealous;\r\nWhat you would work me to, I have some aim:\r\nHow I have thought of this, and of these times,\r\nI shall recount hereafter. For this present,\r\nI would not, so with love I might entreat you,\r\nBe any further mov’d. What you have said,\r\nI will consider; what you have to say\r\nI will with patience hear; and find a time\r\nBoth meet to hear and answer such high things.\r\nTill then, my noble friend, chew upon this:\r\nBrutus had rather be a villager\r\nThan to repute himself a son of Rome\r\nUnder these hard conditions as this time\r\nIs like to lay upon us.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nI am glad that my weak words\r\nHave struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.\r\n\r\nEnter Caesar and his Train.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nThe games are done, and Caesar is returning.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nAs they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,\r\nAnd he will, after his sour fashion, tell you\r\nWhat hath proceeded worthy note today.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nI will do so. But, look you, Cassius,\r\nThe angry spot doth glow on Caesar’s brow,\r\nAnd all the rest look like a chidden train:\r\nCalphurnia’s cheek is pale; and Cicero\r\nLooks with such ferret and such fiery eyes\r\nAs we have seen him in the Capitol,\r\nBeing cross’d in conference by some senators.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nCasca will tell us what the matter is.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nAntonius.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nCaesar?\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nLet me have men about me that are fat,\r\nSleek-headed men, and such as sleep a-nights:\r\nYond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;\r\nHe thinks too much: such men are dangerous.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nFear him not, Caesar; he’s not dangerous;\r\nHe is a noble Roman and well given.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nWould he were fatter! But I fear him not:\r\nYet if my name were liable to fear,\r\nI do not know the man I should avoid\r\nSo soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much,\r\nHe is a great observer, and he looks\r\nQuite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays,\r\nAs thou dost, Antony; he hears no music.\r\nSeldom he smiles; and smiles in such a sort\r\nAs if he mock’d himself and scorn’d his spirit\r\nThat could be mov’d to smile at anything.\r\nSuch men as he be never at heart’s ease\r\nWhiles they behold a greater than themselves,\r\nAnd therefore are they very dangerous.\r\nI rather tell thee what is to be fear’d\r\nThan what I fear; for always I am Caesar.\r\nCome on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,\r\nAnd tell me truly what thou think’st of him.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Caesar and his Train. Casca stays._]\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nYou pull’d me by the cloak; would you speak with me?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nAy, Casca, tell us what hath chanc’d today,\r\nThat Caesar looks so sad.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nWhy, you were with him, were you not?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nI should not then ask Casca what had chanc’d.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nWhy, there was a crown offer’d him; and being offer’d him, he put it by\r\nwith the back of his hand, thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nWhat was the second noise for?\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nWhy, for that too.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nThey shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nWhy, for that too.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nWas the crown offer’d him thrice?\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nAy, marry, was’t, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler than\r\nother; and at every putting-by mine honest neighbours shouted.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nWho offer’d him the crown?\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nWhy, Antony.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nTell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nI can as well be hang’d, as tell the manner of it: it was mere foolery;\r\nI did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown; yet ’twas not a\r\ncrown neither, ’twas one of these coronets; and, as I told you, he put\r\nit by once: but, for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had\r\nit. Then he offered it to him again: then he put it by again: but, to\r\nmy thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he\r\noffered it the third time; he put it the third time by; and still, as\r\nhe refus’d it, the rabblement hooted, and clapp’d their chopt hands,\r\nand threw up their sweaty night-caps, and uttered such a deal of\r\nstinking breath because Caesar refus’d the crown, that it had, almost,\r\nchoked Caesar, for he swooned, and fell down at it. And for mine own\r\npart, I durst not laugh, for fear of opening my lips and receiving the\r\nbad air.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nBut, soft! I pray you. What, did Caesar swoon?\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nHe fell down in the market-place, and foam’d at mouth, and was\r\nspeechless.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\n’Tis very like: he hath the falling-sickness.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nNo, Caesar hath it not; but you, and I,\r\nAnd honest Casca, we have the falling-sickness.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nI know not what you mean by that; but I am sure Caesar fell down. If\r\nthe tag-rag people did not clap him and hiss him, according as he\r\npleased and displeased them, as they use to do the players in the\r\ntheatre, I am no true man.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nWhat said he when he came unto himself?\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nMarry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common herd was glad\r\nhe refused the crown, he pluck’d me ope his doublet, and offer’d them\r\nhis throat to cut. And I had been a man of any occupation, if I would\r\nnot have taken him at a word, I would I might go to hell among the\r\nrogues. And so he fell. When he came to himself again, he said, if he\r\nhad done or said anything amiss, he desir’d their worships to think it\r\nwas his infirmity. Three or four wenches where I stood cried, “Alas,\r\ngood soul!” and forgave him with all their hearts. But there’s no heed\r\nto be taken of them: if Caesar had stabb’d their mothers, they would\r\nhave done no less.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nAnd, after that, he came thus sad away?\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nAy.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nDid Cicero say anything?\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nAy, he spoke Greek.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nTo what effect?\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nNay, and I tell you that, I’ll ne’er look you i’ the face again. But\r\nthose that understood him smil’d at one another and shook their heads;\r\nbut for mine own part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more news\r\ntoo: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs off Caesar’s images, are\r\nput to silence. Fare you well. There was more foolery yet, if I could\r\nremember it.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nWill you sup with me tonight, Casca?\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nNo, I am promis’d forth.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nWill you dine with me tomorrow?\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nAy, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth the\r\neating.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nGood. I will expect you.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nDo so; farewell both.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Casca._]\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nWhat a blunt fellow is this grown to be!\r\nHe was quick mettle when he went to school.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nSo is he now in execution\r\nOf any bold or noble enterprise,\r\nHowever he puts on this tardy form.\r\nThis rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,\r\nWhich gives men stomach to digest his words\r\nWith better appetite.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nAnd so it is. For this time I will leave you:\r\nTomorrow, if you please to speak with me,\r\nI will come home to you; or, if you will,\r\nCome home to me, and I will wait for you.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nI will do so: till then, think of the world.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Brutus._]\r\n\r\nWell, Brutus, thou art noble; yet I see,\r\nThy honourable metal may be wrought\r\nFrom that it is dispos’d: therefore ’tis meet\r\nThat noble minds keep ever with their likes;\r\nFor who so firm that cannot be seduc’d?\r\nCaesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus.\r\nIf I were Brutus now, and he were Cassius,\r\nHe should not humour me. I will this night,\r\nIn several hands, in at his windows throw,\r\nAs if they came from several citizens,\r\nWritings, all tending to the great opinion\r\nThat Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely\r\nCaesar’s ambition shall be glanced at.\r\nAnd after this, let Caesar seat him sure,\r\nFor we will shake him, or worse days endure.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. The same. A street.\r\n\r\nThunder and lightning. Enter, from opposite sides, Casca with his sword\r\ndrawn, and Cicero.\r\n\r\nCICERO.\r\nGood even, Casca: brought you Caesar home?\r\nWhy are you breathless, and why stare you so?\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nAre not you moved, when all the sway of earth\r\nShakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,\r\nI have seen tempests, when the scolding winds\r\nHave riv’d the knotty oaks; and I have seen\r\nTh’ ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,\r\nTo be exalted with the threatening clouds:\r\nBut never till tonight, never till now,\r\nDid I go through a tempest dropping fire.\r\nEither there is a civil strife in heaven,\r\nOr else the world too saucy with the gods,\r\nIncenses them to send destruction.\r\n\r\nCICERO.\r\nWhy, saw you anything more wonderful?\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nA common slave, you’d know him well by sight,\r\nHeld up his left hand, which did flame and burn\r\nLike twenty torches join’d, and yet his hand,\r\nNot sensible of fire remain’d unscorch’d.\r\nBesides, I ha’ not since put up my sword,\r\nAgainst the Capitol I met a lion,\r\nWho glared upon me, and went surly by,\r\nWithout annoying me. And there were drawn\r\nUpon a heap a hundred ghastly women,\r\nTransformed with their fear; who swore they saw\r\nMen, all in fire, walk up and down the streets.\r\nAnd yesterday the bird of night did sit,\r\nEven at noonday upon the marketplace,\r\nHooting and shrieking. When these prodigies\r\nDo so conjointly meet, let not men say,\r\n“These are their reasons; they are natural”;\r\nFor I believe, they are portentous things\r\nUnto the climate that they point upon.\r\n\r\nCICERO.\r\nIndeed, it is a strange-disposed time.\r\nBut men may construe things after their fashion,\r\nClean from the purpose of the things themselves.\r\nComes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow?\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nHe doth, for he did bid Antonius\r\nSend word to you he would be there tomorrow.\r\n\r\nCICERO.\r\nGoodnight then, Casca: this disturbed sky\r\nIs not to walk in.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nFarewell, Cicero.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Cicero._]\r\n\r\nEnter Cassius.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nWho’s there?\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nA Roman.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nCasca, by your voice.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nYour ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nA very pleasing night to honest men.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nWho ever knew the heavens menace so?\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nThose that have known the earth so full of faults.\r\nFor my part, I have walk’d about the streets,\r\nSubmitting me unto the perilous night;\r\nAnd, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,\r\nHave bar’d my bosom to the thunder-stone;\r\nAnd when the cross blue lightning seem’d to open\r\nThe breast of heaven, I did present myself\r\nEven in the aim and very flash of it.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nBut wherefore did you so much tempt the Heavens?\r\nIt is the part of men to fear and tremble,\r\nWhen the most mighty gods by tokens send\r\nSuch dreadful heralds to astonish us.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nYou are dull, Casca; and those sparks of life\r\nThat should be in a Roman you do want,\r\nOr else you use not. You look pale and gaze,\r\nAnd put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,\r\nTo see the strange impatience of the Heavens:\r\nBut if you would consider the true cause\r\nWhy all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,\r\nWhy birds and beasts, from quality and kind;\r\nWhy old men, fools, and children calculate,\r\nWhy all these things change from their ordinance,\r\nTheir natures, and pre-formed faculties,\r\nTo monstrous quality; why, you shall find\r\nThat Heaven hath infus’d them with these spirits,\r\nTo make them instruments of fear and warning\r\nUnto some monstrous state.\r\nNow could I, Casca, name to thee a man\r\nMost like this dreadful night,\r\nThat thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars,\r\nAs doth the lion in the Capitol;\r\nA man no mightier than thyself, or me,\r\nIn personal action; yet prodigious grown,\r\nAnd fearful, as these strange eruptions are.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\n’Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not, Cassius?\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nLet it be who it is: for Romans now\r\nHave thews and limbs like to their ancestors;\r\nBut, woe the while! our fathers’ minds are dead,\r\nAnd we are govern’d with our mothers’ spirits;\r\nOur yoke and sufferance show us womanish.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nIndeed, they say the senators tomorrow\r\nMean to establish Caesar as a king;\r\nAnd he shall wear his crown by sea and land,\r\nIn every place, save here in Italy.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nI know where I will wear this dagger then;\r\nCassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:\r\nTherein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;\r\nTherein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat.\r\nNor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,\r\nNor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,\r\nCan be retentive to the strength of spirit;\r\nBut life, being weary of these worldly bars,\r\nNever lacks power to dismiss itself.\r\nIf I know this, know all the world besides,\r\nThat part of tyranny that I do bear\r\nI can shake off at pleasure.\r\n\r\n[_Thunder still._]\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nSo can I:\r\nSo every bondman in his own hand bears\r\nThe power to cancel his captivity.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nAnd why should Caesar be a tyrant then?\r\nPoor man! I know he would not be a wolf,\r\nBut that he sees the Romans are but sheep:\r\nHe were no lion, were not Romans hinds.\r\nThose that with haste will make a mighty fire\r\nBegin it with weak straws. What trash is Rome,\r\nWhat rubbish, and what offal, when it serves\r\nFor the base matter to illuminate\r\nSo vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,\r\nWhere hast thou led me? I, perhaps, speak this\r\nBefore a willing bondman: then I know\r\nMy answer must be made; but I am arm’d,\r\nAnd dangers are to me indifferent.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nYou speak to Casca, and to such a man\r\nThat is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:\r\nBe factious for redress of all these griefs,\r\nAnd I will set this foot of mine as far\r\nAs who goes farthest.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nThere’s a bargain made.\r\nNow know you, Casca, I have mov’d already\r\nSome certain of the noblest-minded Romans\r\nTo undergo with me an enterprise\r\nOf honourable-dangerous consequence;\r\nAnd I do know by this, they stay for me\r\nIn Pompey’s Porch: for now, this fearful night,\r\nThere is no stir or walking in the streets;\r\nAnd the complexion of the element\r\nIn favour’s like the work we have in hand,\r\nMost bloody, fiery, and most terrible.\r\n\r\nEnter Cinna.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nStand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\n’Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait;\r\nHe is a friend. Cinna, where haste you so?\r\n\r\nCINNA.\r\nTo find out you. Who’s that? Metellus Cimber?\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nNo, it is Casca, one incorporate\r\nTo our attempts. Am I not stay’d for, Cinna?\r\n\r\nCINNA.\r\nI am glad on’t. What a fearful night is this!\r\nThere’s two or three of us have seen strange sights.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nAm I not stay’d for? tell me.\r\n\r\nCINNA.\r\nYes, you are. O Cassius, if you could\r\nBut win the noble Brutus to our party—\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nBe you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,\r\nAnd look you lay it in the praetor’s chair,\r\nWhere Brutus may but find it; and throw this\r\nIn at his window; set this up with wax\r\nUpon old Brutus’ statue: all this done,\r\nRepair to Pompey’s Porch, where you shall find us.\r\nIs Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?\r\n\r\nCINNA.\r\nAll but Metellus Cimber, and he’s gone\r\nTo seek you at your house. Well, I will hie,\r\nAnd so bestow these papers as you bade me.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nThat done, repair to Pompey’s theatre.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Cinna._]\r\n\r\nCome, Casca, you and I will yet, ere day,\r\nSee Brutus at his house: three parts of him\r\nIs ours already, and the man entire\r\nUpon the next encounter, yields him ours.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nO, he sits high in all the people’s hearts!\r\nAnd that which would appear offence in us,\r\nHis countenance, like richest alchemy,\r\nWill change to virtue and to worthiness.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nHim, and his worth, and our great need of him,\r\nYou have right well conceited. Let us go,\r\nFor it is after midnight; and ere day,\r\nWe will awake him, and be sure of him.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\nACT II\r\n\r\nSCENE I. Rome. Brutus’ orchard.\r\n\nEnter Brutus.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nWhat, Lucius, ho!\r\nI cannot, by the progress of the stars,\r\nGive guess how near to day.—Lucius, I say!\r\nI would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.\r\nWhen, Lucius, when? Awake, I say! What, Lucius!\r\n\r\nEnter Lucius.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nCall’d you, my lord?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nGet me a taper in my study, Lucius:\r\nWhen it is lighted, come and call me here.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nI will, my lord.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nIt must be by his death: and for my part,\r\nI know no personal cause to spurn at him,\r\nBut for the general. He would be crown’d:\r\nHow that might change his nature, there’s the question.\r\nIt is the bright day that brings forth the adder,\r\nAnd that craves wary walking. Crown him?—that;\r\nAnd then, I grant, we put a sting in him,\r\nThat at his will he may do danger with.\r\nTh’ abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins\r\nRemorse from power; and, to speak truth of Caesar,\r\nI have not known when his affections sway’d\r\nMore than his reason. But ’tis a common proof,\r\nThat lowliness is young ambition’s ladder,\r\nWhereto the climber-upward turns his face;\r\nBut when he once attains the upmost round,\r\nHe then unto the ladder turns his back,\r\nLooks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees\r\nBy which he did ascend. So Caesar may;\r\nThen lest he may, prevent. And since the quarrel\r\nWill bear no colour for the thing he is,\r\nFashion it thus: that what he is, augmented,\r\nWould run to these and these extremities:\r\nAnd therefore think him as a serpent’s egg\r\nWhich hatch’d, would, as his kind grow mischievous;\r\nAnd kill him in the shell.\r\n\r\nEnter Lucius.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nThe taper burneth in your closet, sir.\r\nSearching the window for a flint, I found\r\nThis paper, thus seal’d up, and I am sure\r\nIt did not lie there when I went to bed.\r\n\r\n[_Gives him the letter._]\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nGet you to bed again; it is not day.\r\nIs not tomorrow, boy, the Ides of March?\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nI know not, sir.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nLook in the calendar, and bring me word.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nI will, sir.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nThe exhalations, whizzing in the air\r\nGive so much light that I may read by them.\r\n\r\n[_Opens the letter and reads._]\r\n\r\n_Brutus, thou sleep’st: awake and see thyself.\r\nShall Rome, &c. Speak, strike, redress!_\r\n“Brutus, thou sleep’st: awake!”\r\nSuch instigations have been often dropp’d\r\nWhere I have took them up.\r\n“Shall Rome, &c.” Thus must I piece it out:\r\nShall Rome stand under one man’s awe? What, Rome?\r\nMy ancestors did from the streets of Rome\r\nThe Tarquin drive, when he was call’d a king.\r\n“Speak, strike, redress!” Am I entreated\r\nTo speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,\r\nIf the redress will follow, thou receivest\r\nThy full petition at the hand of Brutus.\r\n\r\nEnter Lucius.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nSir, March is wasted fifteen days.\r\n\r\n[_Knock within._]\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\n’Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Lucius._]\r\n\r\nSince Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,\r\nI have not slept.\r\nBetween the acting of a dreadful thing\r\nAnd the first motion, all the interim is\r\nLike a phantasma, or a hideous dream:\r\nThe genius and the mortal instruments\r\nAre then in council; and the state of man,\r\nLike to a little kingdom, suffers then\r\nThe nature of an insurrection.\r\n\r\nEnter Lucius.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nSir, ’tis your brother Cassius at the door,\r\nWho doth desire to see you.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nIs he alone?\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nNo, sir, there are moe with him.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nDo you know them?\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nNo, sir, their hats are pluck’d about their ears,\r\nAnd half their faces buried in their cloaks,\r\nThat by no means I may discover them\r\nBy any mark of favour.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nLet ’em enter.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Lucius._]\r\n\r\nThey are the faction. O conspiracy,\r\nSham’st thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,\r\nWhen evils are most free? O, then, by day\r\nWhere wilt thou find a cavern dark enough\r\nTo mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy;\r\nHide it in smiles and affability:\r\nFor if thou path, thy native semblance on,\r\nNot Erebus itself were dim enough\r\nTo hide thee from prevention.\r\n\r\nEnter Cassius, Casca, Decius, Cinna, Metellus Cimber and Trebonius.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nI think we are too bold upon your rest:\r\nGood morrow, Brutus; do we trouble you?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nI have been up this hour, awake all night.\r\nKnow I these men that come along with you?\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nYes, every man of them; and no man here\r\nBut honours you; and everyone doth wish\r\nYou had but that opinion of yourself\r\nWhich every noble Roman bears of you.\r\nThis is Trebonius.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nHe is welcome hither.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nThis Decius Brutus.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nHe is welcome too.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nThis, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nThey are all welcome.\r\nWhat watchful cares do interpose themselves\r\nBetwixt your eyes and night?\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nShall I entreat a word?\r\n\r\n[_They whisper._]\r\n\r\nDECIUS.\r\nHere lies the east: doth not the day break here?\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nCINNA.\r\nO, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon grey lines\r\nThat fret the clouds are messengers of day.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nYou shall confess that you are both deceiv’d.\r\nHere, as I point my sword, the Sun arises;\r\nWhich is a great way growing on the South,\r\nWeighing the youthful season of the year.\r\nSome two months hence, up higher toward the North\r\nHe first presents his fire; and the high East\r\nStands, as the Capitol, directly here.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nGive me your hands all over, one by one.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nAnd let us swear our resolution.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nNo, not an oath. If not the face of men,\r\nThe sufferance of our souls, the time’s abuse—\r\nIf these be motives weak, break off betimes,\r\nAnd every man hence to his idle bed.\r\nSo let high-sighted tyranny range on,\r\nTill each man drop by lottery. But if these,\r\nAs I am sure they do, bear fire enough\r\nTo kindle cowards, and to steel with valour\r\nThe melting spirits of women; then, countrymen,\r\nWhat need we any spur but our own cause\r\nTo prick us to redress? what other bond\r\nThan secret Romans, that have spoke the word,\r\nAnd will not palter? and what other oath\r\nThan honesty to honesty engag’d,\r\nThat this shall be, or we will fall for it?\r\nSwear priests and cowards, and men cautelous,\r\nOld feeble carrions, and such suffering souls\r\nThat welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear\r\nSuch creatures as men doubt; but do not stain\r\nThe even virtue of our enterprise,\r\nNor th’ insuppressive mettle of our spirits,\r\nTo think that or our cause or our performance\r\nDid need an oath; when every drop of blood\r\nThat every Roman bears, and nobly bears,\r\nIs guilty of a several bastardy,\r\nIf he do break the smallest particle\r\nOf any promise that hath pass’d from him.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nBut what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?\r\nI think he will stand very strong with us.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nLet us not leave him out.\r\n\r\nCINNA.\r\nNo, by no means.\r\n\r\nMETELLUS.\r\nO, let us have him, for his silver hairs\r\nWill purchase us a good opinion,\r\nAnd buy men’s voices to commend our deeds.\r\nIt shall be said, his judgement rul’d our hands;\r\nOur youths and wildness shall no whit appear,\r\nBut all be buried in his gravity.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nO, name him not; let us not break with him;\r\nFor he will never follow anything\r\nThat other men begin.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nThen leave him out.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nIndeed, he is not fit.\r\n\r\nDECIUS.\r\nShall no man else be touch’d but only Caesar?\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nDecius, well urg’d. I think it is not meet,\r\nMark Antony, so well belov’d of Caesar,\r\nShould outlive Caesar: we shall find of him\r\nA shrewd contriver; and you know, his means,\r\nIf he improve them, may well stretch so far\r\nAs to annoy us all; which to prevent,\r\nLet Antony and Caesar fall together.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nOur course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,\r\nTo cut the head off, and then hack the limbs,\r\nLike wrath in death, and envy afterwards;\r\nFor Antony is but a limb of Caesar.\r\nLet us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.\r\nWe all stand up against the spirit of Caesar,\r\nAnd in the spirit of men there is no blood.\r\nO, that we then could come by Caesar’s spirit,\r\nAnd not dismember Caesar! But, alas,\r\nCaesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,\r\nLet’s kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;\r\nLet’s carve him as a dish fit for the gods,\r\nNot hew him as a carcass fit for hounds.\r\nAnd let our hearts, as subtle masters do,\r\nStir up their servants to an act of rage,\r\nAnd after seem to chide ’em. This shall mark\r\nOur purpose necessary, and not envious;\r\nWhich so appearing to the common eyes,\r\nWe shall be call’d purgers, not murderers.\r\nAnd for Mark Antony, think not of him;\r\nFor he can do no more than Caesar’s arm\r\nWhen Caesar’s head is off.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nYet I fear him;\r\nFor in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar—\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nAlas, good Cassius, do not think of him:\r\nIf he love Caesar, all that he can do\r\nIs to himself; take thought and die for Caesar.\r\nAnd that were much he should; for he is given\r\nTo sports, to wildness, and much company.\r\n\r\nTREBONIUS.\r\nThere is no fear in him; let him not die;\r\nFor he will live, and laugh at this hereafter.\r\n\r\n[_Clock strikes._]\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nPeace! count the clock.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nThe clock hath stricken three.\r\n\r\nTREBONIUS.\r\n’Tis time to part.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nBut it is doubtful yet\r\nWhether Caesar will come forth today or no;\r\nFor he is superstitious grown of late,\r\nQuite from the main opinion he held once\r\nOf fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies.\r\nIt may be these apparent prodigies,\r\nThe unaccustom’d terror of this night,\r\nAnd the persuasion of his augurers,\r\nMay hold him from the Capitol today.\r\n\r\nDECIUS.\r\nNever fear that: if he be so resolved,\r\nI can o’ersway him, for he loves to hear\r\nThat unicorns may be betray’d with trees,\r\nAnd bears with glasses, elephants with holes,\r\nLions with toils, and men with flatterers.\r\nBut when I tell him he hates flatterers,\r\nHe says he does, being then most flattered.\r\nLet me work;\r\nFor I can give his humour the true bent,\r\nAnd I will bring him to the Capitol.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nNay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nBy the eighth hour: is that the uttermost?\r\n\r\nCINNA.\r\nBe that the uttermost; and fail not then.\r\n\r\nMETELLUS.\r\nCaius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,\r\nWho rated him for speaking well of Pompey;\r\nI wonder none of you have thought of him.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nNow, good Metellus, go along by him:\r\nHe loves me well, and I have given him reason;\r\nSend him but hither, and I’ll fashion him.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nThe morning comes upon’s. We’ll leave you, Brutus.\r\nAnd, friends, disperse yourselves; but all remember\r\nWhat you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nGood gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;\r\nLet not our looks put on our purposes,\r\nBut bear it as our Roman actors do,\r\nWith untired spirits and formal constancy.\r\nAnd so, good morrow to you everyone.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt all but Brutus._]\r\n\r\nBoy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter;\r\nEnjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber:\r\nThou hast no figures nor no fantasies,\r\nWhich busy care draws in the brains of men;\r\nTherefore thou sleep’st so sound.\r\n\r\nEnter Portia.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nBrutus, my lord.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nPortia, what mean you? Wherefore rise you now?\r\nIt is not for your health thus to commit\r\nYour weak condition to the raw cold morning.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nNor for yours neither. Y’ have ungently, Brutus,\r\nStole from my bed; and yesternight at supper,\r\nYou suddenly arose, and walk’d about,\r\nMusing and sighing, with your arms across;\r\nAnd when I ask’d you what the matter was,\r\nYou star’d upon me with ungentle looks.\r\nI urg’d you further; then you scratch’d your head,\r\nAnd too impatiently stamp’d with your foot;\r\nYet I insisted, yet you answer’d not,\r\nBut with an angry wafture of your hand\r\nGave sign for me to leave you. So I did,\r\nFearing to strengthen that impatience\r\nWhich seem’d too much enkindled; and withal\r\nHoping it was but an effect of humour,\r\nWhich sometime hath his hour with every man.\r\nIt will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep;\r\nAnd could it work so much upon your shape\r\nAs it hath much prevail’d on your condition,\r\nI should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,\r\nMake me acquainted with your cause of grief.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nI am not well in health, and that is all.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nBrutus is wise, and, were he not in health,\r\nHe would embrace the means to come by it.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nWhy, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nIs Brutus sick, and is it physical\r\nTo walk unbraced and suck up the humours\r\nOf the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,\r\nAnd will he steal out of his wholesome bed\r\nTo dare the vile contagion of the night,\r\nAnd tempt the rheumy and unpurged air\r\nTo add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;\r\nYou have some sick offence within your mind,\r\nWhich, by the right and virtue of my place,\r\nI ought to know of: and, upon my knees,\r\nI charm you, by my once commended beauty,\r\nBy all your vows of love, and that great vow\r\nWhich did incorporate and make us one,\r\nThat you unfold to me, your self, your half,\r\nWhy you are heavy, and what men tonight\r\nHave had resort to you; for here have been\r\nSome six or seven, who did hide their faces\r\nEven from darkness.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nKneel not, gentle Portia.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nI should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.\r\nWithin the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,\r\nIs it excepted I should know no secrets\r\nThat appertain to you? Am I your self\r\nBut, as it were, in sort or limitation,\r\nTo keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,\r\nAnd talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs\r\nOf your good pleasure? If it be no more,\r\nPortia is Brutus’ harlot, not his wife.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nYou are my true and honourable wife,\r\nAs dear to me as are the ruddy drops\r\nThat visit my sad heart.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nIf this were true, then should I know this secret.\r\nI grant I am a woman; but withal\r\nA woman that Lord Brutus took to wife;\r\nI grant I am a woman; but withal\r\nA woman well reputed, Cato’s daughter.\r\nThink you I am no stronger than my sex,\r\nBeing so father’d and so husbanded?\r\nTell me your counsels, I will not disclose ’em.\r\nI have made strong proof of my constancy,\r\nGiving myself a voluntary wound\r\nHere, in the thigh: can I bear that with patience\r\nAnd not my husband’s secrets?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nO ye gods,\r\nRender me worthy of this noble wife!\r\n\r\n[_Knock._]\r\n\r\nHark, hark, one knocks. Portia, go in awhile;\r\nAnd by and by thy bosom shall partake\r\nThe secrets of my heart.\r\nAll my engagements I will construe to thee,\r\nAll the charactery of my sad brows.\r\nLeave me with haste.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Portia._]\r\n\r\nEnter Lucius with Ligarius.\r\n\r\nLucius, who’s that knocks?\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nHere is a sick man that would speak with you.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nCaius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.\r\nBoy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius, how?\r\n\r\nLIGARIUS.\r\nVouchsafe good-morrow from a feeble tongue.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nO, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,\r\nTo wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!\r\n\r\nLIGARIUS.\r\nI am not sick, if Brutus have in hand\r\nAny exploit worthy the name of honour.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nSuch an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,\r\nHad you a healthful ear to hear of it.\r\n\r\nLIGARIUS.\r\nBy all the gods that Romans bow before,\r\nI here discard my sickness. Soul of Rome!\r\nBrave son, derived from honourable loins!\r\nThou, like an exorcist, hast conjur’d up\r\nMy mortified spirit. Now bid me run,\r\nAnd I will strive with things impossible,\r\nYea, get the better of them. What’s to do?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nA piece of work that will make sick men whole.\r\n\r\nLIGARIUS.\r\nBut are not some whole that we must make sick?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nThat must we also. What it is, my Caius,\r\nI shall unfold to thee, as we are going,\r\nTo whom it must be done.\r\n\r\nLIGARIUS.\r\nSet on your foot,\r\nAnd with a heart new-fir’d I follow you,\r\nTo do I know not what; but it sufficeth\r\nThat Brutus leads me on.\r\n\r\n[_Thunder._]\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nFollow me then.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. A room in Caesar’s palace.\r\n\r\nThunder and lightning. Enter Caesar, in his nightgown.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nNor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight:\r\nThrice hath Calphurnia in her sleep cried out,\r\n“Help, ho! They murder Caesar!” Who’s within?\r\n\r\nEnter a Servant.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nMy lord?\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nGo bid the priests do present sacrifice,\r\nAnd bring me their opinions of success.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nI will, my lord.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nEnter Calphurnia.\r\n\r\nCALPHURNIA.\r\nWhat mean you, Caesar? Think you to walk forth?\r\nYou shall not stir out of your house today.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nCaesar shall forth. The things that threaten’d me\r\nNe’er look’d but on my back; when they shall see\r\nThe face of Caesar, they are vanished.\r\n\r\nCALPHURNIA.\r\nCaesar, I never stood on ceremonies,\r\nYet now they fright me. There is one within,\r\nBesides the things that we have heard and seen,\r\nRecounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.\r\nA lioness hath whelped in the streets,\r\nAnd graves have yawn’d, and yielded up their dead;\r\nFierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds\r\nIn ranks and squadrons and right form of war,\r\nWhich drizzled blood upon the Capitol;\r\nThe noise of battle hurtled in the air,\r\nHorses did neigh, and dying men did groan,\r\nAnd ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.\r\nO Caesar, these things are beyond all use,\r\nAnd I do fear them!\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nWhat can be avoided\r\nWhose end is purpos’d by the mighty gods?\r\nYet Caesar shall go forth; for these predictions\r\nAre to the world in general as to Caesar.\r\n\r\nCALPHURNIA.\r\nWhen beggars die, there are no comets seen;\r\nThe heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nCowards die many times before their deaths;\r\nThe valiant never taste of death but once.\r\nOf all the wonders that I yet have heard,\r\nIt seems to me most strange that men should fear,\r\nSeeing that death, a necessary end,\r\nWill come when it will come.\r\n\r\nEnter Servant.\r\n\r\nWhat say the augurers?\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nThey would not have you to stir forth today.\r\nPlucking the entrails of an offering forth,\r\nThey could not find a heart within the beast.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nThe gods do this in shame of cowardice:\r\nCaesar should be a beast without a heart\r\nIf he should stay at home today for fear.\r\nNo, Caesar shall not. Danger knows full well\r\nThat Caesar is more dangerous than he.\r\nWe are two lions litter’d in one day,\r\nAnd I the elder and more terrible,\r\nAnd Caesar shall go forth.\r\n\r\nCALPHURNIA.\r\nAlas, my lord,\r\nYour wisdom is consum’d in confidence.\r\nDo not go forth today: call it my fear\r\nThat keeps you in the house, and not your own.\r\nWe’ll send Mark Antony to the Senate-house,\r\nAnd he shall say you are not well today.\r\nLet me upon my knee prevail in this.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nMark Antony shall say I am not well,\r\nAnd for thy humour, I will stay at home.\r\n\r\nEnter Decius.\r\n\r\nHere’s Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so.\r\n\r\nDECIUS.\r\nCaesar, all hail! Good morrow, worthy Caesar.\r\nI come to fetch you to the Senate-house.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nAnd you are come in very happy time\r\nTo bear my greeting to the Senators,\r\nAnd tell them that I will not come today.\r\nCannot, is false; and that I dare not, falser:\r\nI will not come today. Tell them so, Decius.\r\n\r\nCALPHURNIA.\r\nSay he is sick.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nShall Caesar send a lie?\r\nHave I in conquest stretch’d mine arm so far,\r\nTo be afeard to tell grey-beards the truth?\r\nDecius, go tell them Caesar will not come.\r\n\r\nDECIUS.\r\nMost mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,\r\nLest I be laugh’d at when I tell them so.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nThe cause is in my will; I will not come.\r\nThat is enough to satisfy the Senate.\r\nBut for your private satisfaction,\r\nBecause I love you, I will let you know:\r\nCalphurnia here, my wife, stays me at home.\r\nShe dreamt tonight she saw my statue,\r\nWhich like a fountain with an hundred spouts\r\nDid run pure blood; and many lusty Romans\r\nCame smiling, and did bathe their hands in it.\r\nAnd these does she apply for warnings and portents\r\nAnd evils imminent; and on her knee\r\nHath begg’d that I will stay at home today.\r\n\r\nDECIUS.\r\nThis dream is all amiss interpreted:\r\nIt was a vision fair and fortunate.\r\nYour statue spouting blood in many pipes,\r\nIn which so many smiling Romans bath’d,\r\nSignifies that from you great Rome shall suck\r\nReviving blood, and that great men shall press\r\nFor tinctures, stains, relics, and cognizance.\r\nThis by Calphurnia’s dream is signified.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nAnd this way have you well expounded it.\r\n\r\nDECIUS.\r\nI have, when you have heard what I can say;\r\nAnd know it now. The Senate have concluded\r\nTo give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.\r\nIf you shall send them word you will not come,\r\nTheir minds may change. Besides, it were a mock\r\nApt to be render’d, for someone to say,\r\n“Break up the Senate till another time,\r\nWhen Caesar’s wife shall meet with better dreams.”\r\nIf Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper\r\n“Lo, Caesar is afraid”?\r\nPardon me, Caesar; for my dear dear love\r\nTo your proceeding bids me tell you this,\r\nAnd reason to my love is liable.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nHow foolish do your fears seem now, Calphurnia!\r\nI am ashamed I did yield to them.\r\nGive me my robe, for I will go.\r\n\r\nEnter Brutus, Ligarius, Metellus, Casca, Trebonius, Cinna and Publius.\r\n\r\nAnd look where Publius is come to fetch me.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\nGood morrow, Caesar.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nWelcome, Publius.\r\nWhat, Brutus, are you stirr’d so early too?\r\nGood morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius,\r\nCaesar was ne’er so much your enemy\r\nAs that same ague which hath made you lean.\r\nWhat is’t o’clock?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nCaesar, ’tis strucken eight.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nI thank you for your pains and courtesy.\r\n\r\nEnter Antony.\r\n\r\nSee! Antony, that revels long a-nights,\r\nIs notwithstanding up. Good morrow, Antony.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nSo to most noble Caesar.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nBid them prepare within.\r\nI am to blame to be thus waited for.\r\nNow, Cinna; now, Metellus; what, Trebonius!\r\nI have an hour’s talk in store for you:\r\nRemember that you call on me today;\r\nBe near me, that I may remember you.\r\n\r\nTREBONIUS.\r\nCaesar, I will. [_Aside._] and so near will I be,\r\nThat your best friends shall wish I had been further.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nGood friends, go in, and taste some wine with me;\r\nAnd we, like friends, will straightway go together.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\n[_Aside._] That every like is not the same, O Caesar,\r\nThe heart of Brutus yearns to think upon.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. A street near the Capitol.\r\n\r\nEnter Artemidorus, reading a paper.\r\n\r\nARTEMIDORUS.\r\n_“Caesar, beware of Brutus; take heed of Cassius; come not near Casca;\r\nhave an eye to Cinna; trust not Trebonius; mark well Metellus Cimber;\r\nDecius Brutus loves thee not; thou hast wrong’d Caius Ligarius. There\r\nis but one mind in all these men, and it is bent against Caesar. If\r\nthou be’st not immortal, look about you: security gives way to\r\nconspiracy. The mighty gods defend thee!\r\nThy lover, Artemidorus.”_ Here will I stand till Caesar pass along, And\r\nas a suitor will I give him this. My heart laments that virtue cannot\r\nlive Out of the teeth of emulation. If thou read this, O Caesar, thou\r\nmayest live; If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.\r\n\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV. Another part of the same street, before the house of Brutus.\r\n\r\nEnter Portia and Lucius.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nI pr’ythee, boy, run to the Senate-house;\r\nStay not to answer me, but get thee gone.\r\nWhy dost thou stay?\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nTo know my errand, madam.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nI would have had thee there and here again,\r\nEre I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.\r\n[_Aside._] O constancy, be strong upon my side,\r\nSet a huge mountain ’tween my heart and tongue!\r\nI have a man’s mind, but a woman’s might.\r\nHow hard it is for women to keep counsel!\r\nArt thou here yet?\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nMadam, what should I do?\r\nRun to the Capitol, and nothing else?\r\nAnd so return to you, and nothing else?\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nYes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,\r\nFor he went sickly forth: and take good note\r\nWhat Caesar doth, what suitors press to him.\r\nHark, boy, what noise is that?\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nI hear none, madam.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nPr’ythee, listen well.\r\nI heard a bustling rumour, like a fray,\r\nAnd the wind brings it from the Capitol.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nSooth, madam, I hear nothing.\r\n\r\nEnter the Soothsayer.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nCome hither, fellow:\r\nWhich way hast thou been?\r\n\r\nSOOTHSAYER.\r\nAt mine own house, good lady.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nWhat is’t o’clock?\r\n\r\nSOOTHSAYER.\r\nAbout the ninth hour, lady.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nIs Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?\r\n\r\nSOOTHSAYER.\r\nMadam, not yet. I go to take my stand,\r\nTo see him pass on to the Capitol.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nThou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?\r\n\r\nSOOTHSAYER.\r\nThat I have, lady, if it will please Caesar\r\nTo be so good to Caesar as to hear me,\r\nI shall beseech him to befriend himself.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nWhy, know’st thou any harm’s intended towards him?\r\n\r\nSOOTHSAYER.\r\nNone that I know will be, much that I fear may chance.\r\nGood morrow to you. Here the street is narrow.\r\nThe throng that follows Caesar at the heels,\r\nOf Senators, of Praetors, common suitors,\r\nWill crowd a feeble man almost to death:\r\nI’ll get me to a place more void, and there\r\nSpeak to great Caesar as he comes along.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nI must go in.\r\n[_Aside._] Ay me, how weak a thing\r\nThe heart of woman is! O Brutus,\r\nThe heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!\r\nSure, the boy heard me. Brutus hath a suit\r\nThat Caesar will not grant. O, I grow faint.\r\nRun, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;\r\nSay I am merry; come to me again,\r\nAnd bring me word what he doth say to thee.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\nACT III\r\n\r\nSCENE I. Rome. Before the Capitol; the Senate sitting.\r\n\nA crowd of people in the street leading to the Capitol. Flourish. Enter\r\nCaesar, Brutus, Cassius, Casca, Decius, Metellus, Trebonius, Cinna,\r\nAntony, Lepidus, Artemidorus, Publius, Popilius and the Soothsayer.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nThe Ides of March are come.\r\n\r\nSOOTHSAYER.\r\nAy, Caesar; but not gone.\r\n\r\nARTEMIDORUS.\r\nHail, Caesar! Read this schedule.\r\n\r\nDECIUS.\r\nTrebonius doth desire you to o’er-read,\r\nAt your best leisure, this his humble suit.\r\n\r\nARTEMIDORUS.\r\nO Caesar, read mine first; for mine’s a suit\r\nThat touches Caesar nearer. Read it, great Caesar.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nWhat touches us ourself shall be last serv’d.\r\n\r\nARTEMIDORUS.\r\nDelay not, Caesar. Read it instantly.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nWhat, is the fellow mad?\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\nSirrah, give place.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nWhat, urge you your petitions in the street?\r\nCome to the Capitol.\r\n\r\nCaesar enters the Capitol, the rest following. All the Senators rise.\r\n\r\nPOPILIUS.\r\nI wish your enterprise today may thrive.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nWhat enterprise, Popilius?\r\n\r\nPOPILIUS.\r\nFare you well.\r\n\r\n[_Advances to Caesar._]\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nWhat said Popilius Lena?\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nHe wish’d today our enterprise might thrive.\r\nI fear our purpose is discovered.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nLook how he makes to Caesar: mark him.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nCasca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.\r\nBrutus, what shall be done? If this be known,\r\nCassius or Caesar never shall turn back,\r\nFor I will slay myself.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nCassius, be constant:\r\nPopilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;\r\nFor look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nTrebonius knows his time, for look you, Brutus,\r\nHe draws Mark Antony out of the way.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Antony and Trebonius. Caesar and the Senators take their\r\nseats._]\r\n\r\nDECIUS.\r\nWhere is Metellus Cimber? Let him go,\r\nAnd presently prefer his suit to Caesar.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nHe is address’d; press near and second him.\r\n\r\nCINNA.\r\nCasca, you are the first that rears your hand.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nAre we all ready? What is now amiss\r\nThat Caesar and his Senate must redress?\r\n\r\nMETELLUS.\r\nMost high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar,\r\nMetellus Cimber throws before thy seat\r\nAn humble heart.\r\n\r\n[_Kneeling._]\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nI must prevent thee, Cimber.\r\nThese couchings and these lowly courtesies\r\nMight fire the blood of ordinary men,\r\nAnd turn pre-ordinance and first decree\r\nInto the law of children. Be not fond,\r\nTo think that Caesar bears such rebel blood\r\nThat will be thaw’d from the true quality\r\nWith that which melteth fools; I mean sweet words,\r\nLow-crooked curtsies, and base spaniel fawning.\r\nThy brother by decree is banished:\r\nIf thou dost bend, and pray, and fawn for him,\r\nI spurn thee like a cur out of my way.\r\nKnow, Caesar dost not wrong, nor without cause\r\nWill he be satisfied.\r\n\r\nMETELLUS.\r\nIs there no voice more worthy than my own,\r\nTo sound more sweetly in great Caesar’s ear\r\nFor the repealing of my banish’d brother?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nI kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar;\r\nDesiring thee that Publius Cimber may\r\nHave an immediate freedom of repeal.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nWhat, Brutus?\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nPardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon:\r\nAs low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall,\r\nTo beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nI could be well mov’d, if I were as you;\r\nIf I could pray to move, prayers would move me:\r\nBut I am constant as the northern star,\r\nOf whose true-fix’d and resting quality\r\nThere is no fellow in the firmament.\r\nThe skies are painted with unnumber’d sparks,\r\nThey are all fire, and every one doth shine;\r\nBut there’s but one in all doth hold his place.\r\nSo in the world; ’tis furnish’d well with men,\r\nAnd men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;\r\nYet in the number I do know but one\r\nThat unassailable holds on his rank,\r\nUnshak’d of motion: and that I am he,\r\nLet me a little show it, even in this,\r\nThat I was constant Cimber should be banish’d,\r\nAnd constant do remain to keep him so.\r\n\r\nCINNA.\r\nO Caesar,—\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nHence! wilt thou lift up Olympus?\r\n\r\nDECIUS.\r\nGreat Caesar,—\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nDoth not Brutus bootless kneel?\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nSpeak, hands, for me!\r\n\r\n[_Casca stabs Caesar in the neck. Caesar catches hold of his arm. He is\r\nthen stabbed by several other Conspirators, and at last by Marcus\r\nBrutus._]\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\n_Et tu, Brute?_—Then fall, Caesar!\r\n\r\n[_Dies. The Senators and People retire in confusion._]\r\n\r\nCINNA.\r\nLiberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!\r\nRun hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nSome to the common pulpits and cry out,\r\n“Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!”\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nPeople and Senators, be not affrighted.\r\nFly not; stand still; ambition’s debt is paid.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nGo to the pulpit, Brutus.\r\n\r\nDECIUS.\r\nAnd Cassius too.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nWhere’s Publius?\r\n\r\nCINNA.\r\nHere, quite confounded with this mutiny.\r\n\r\nMETELLUS.\r\nStand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar’s\r\nShould chance—\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nTalk not of standing. Publius, good cheer!\r\nThere is no harm intended to your person,\r\nNor to no Roman else. So tell them, Publius.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nAnd leave us, Publius; lest that the people\r\nRushing on us, should do your age some mischief.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nDo so; and let no man abide this deed\r\nBut we the doers.\r\n\r\nEnter Trebonius.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nWhere’s Antony?\r\n\r\nTREBONIUS.\r\nFled to his house amaz’d.\r\nMen, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run,\r\nAs it were doomsday.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nFates, we will know your pleasures.\r\nThat we shall die, we know; ’tis but the time\r\nAnd drawing days out, that men stand upon.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nWhy, he that cuts off twenty years of life\r\nCuts off so many years of fearing death.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nGrant that, and then is death a benefit:\r\nSo are we Caesar’s friends, that have abridg’d\r\nHis time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,\r\nAnd let us bathe our hands in Caesar’s blood\r\nUp to the elbows, and besmear our swords:\r\nThen walk we forth, even to the market-place,\r\nAnd waving our red weapons o’er our heads,\r\nLet’s all cry, “Peace, freedom, and liberty!”\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nStoop then, and wash. How many ages hence\r\nShall this our lofty scene be acted over\r\nIn States unborn, and accents yet unknown!\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nHow many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,\r\nThat now on Pompey’s basis lies along,\r\nNo worthier than the dust!\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nSo oft as that shall be,\r\nSo often shall the knot of us be call’d\r\nThe men that gave their country liberty.\r\n\r\nDECIUS.\r\nWhat, shall we forth?\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nAy, every man away.\r\nBrutus shall lead; and we will grace his heels\r\nWith the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.\r\n\r\nEnter a Servant.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nSoft, who comes here? A friend of Antony’s.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nThus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel;\r\nThus did Mark Antony bid me fall down;\r\nAnd, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:\r\nBrutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;\r\nCaesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving;\r\nSay I love Brutus and I honour him;\r\nSay I fear’d Caesar, honour’d him, and lov’d him.\r\nIf Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony\r\nMay safely come to him, and be resolv’d\r\nHow Caesar hath deserv’d to lie in death,\r\nMark Antony shall not love Caesar dead\r\nSo well as Brutus living; but will follow\r\nThe fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus\r\nThorough the hazards of this untrod state,\r\nWith all true faith. So says my master Antony.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nThy master is a wise and valiant Roman;\r\nI never thought him worse.\r\nTell him, so please him come unto this place,\r\nHe shall be satisfied and, by my honour,\r\nDepart untouch’d.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nI’ll fetch him presently.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nI know that we shall have him well to friend.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nI wish we may: but yet have I a mind\r\nThat fears him much; and my misgiving still\r\nFalls shrewdly to the purpose.\r\n\r\nEnter Antony.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nBut here comes Antony. Welcome, Mark Antony.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nO mighty Caesar! Dost thou lie so low?\r\nAre all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,\r\nShrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.\r\nI know not, gentlemen, what you intend,\r\nWho else must be let blood, who else is rank:\r\nIf I myself, there is no hour so fit\r\nAs Caesar’s death’s hour; nor no instrument\r\nOf half that worth as those your swords, made rich\r\nWith the most noble blood of all this world.\r\nI do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,\r\nNow, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,\r\nFulfill your pleasure. Live a thousand years,\r\nI shall not find myself so apt to die.\r\nNo place will please me so, no means of death,\r\nAs here by Caesar, and by you cut off,\r\nThe choice and master spirits of this age.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nO Antony, beg not your death of us.\r\nThough now we must appear bloody and cruel,\r\nAs by our hands and this our present act\r\nYou see we do; yet see you but our hands\r\nAnd this the bleeding business they have done.\r\nOur hearts you see not; they are pitiful;\r\nAnd pity to the general wrong of Rome—\r\nAs fire drives out fire, so pity pity—\r\nHath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,\r\nTo you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony;\r\nOur arms in strength of malice, and our hearts\r\nOf brothers’ temper, do receive you in\r\nWith all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nYour voice shall be as strong as any man’s\r\nIn the disposing of new dignities.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nOnly be patient till we have appeas’d\r\nThe multitude, beside themselves with fear,\r\nAnd then we will deliver you the cause\r\nWhy I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,\r\nHave thus proceeded.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nI doubt not of your wisdom.\r\nLet each man render me his bloody hand.\r\nFirst, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;\r\nNext, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand.\r\nNow, Decius Brutus, yours; now yours, Metellus;\r\nYours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;\r\nThough last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.\r\nGentlemen all—alas, what shall I say?\r\nMy credit now stands on such slippery ground,\r\nThat one of two bad ways you must conceit me,\r\nEither a coward or a flatterer.\r\nThat I did love thee, Caesar, O, ’tis true:\r\nIf then thy spirit look upon us now,\r\nShall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,\r\nTo see thy Antony making his peace,\r\nShaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,\r\nMost noble, in the presence of thy corse?\r\nHad I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,\r\nWeeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,\r\nIt would become me better than to close\r\nIn terms of friendship with thine enemies.\r\nPardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay’d, brave hart;\r\nHere didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,\r\nSign’d in thy spoil, and crimson’d in thy lethe.\r\nO world, thou wast the forest to this hart;\r\nAnd this indeed, O world, the heart of thee.\r\nHow like a deer strucken by many princes,\r\nDost thou here lie!\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nMark Antony,—\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nPardon me, Caius Cassius:\r\nThe enemies of Caesar shall say this;\r\nThen, in a friend, it is cold modesty.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nI blame you not for praising Caesar so;\r\nBut what compact mean you to have with us?\r\nWill you be prick’d in number of our friends,\r\nOr shall we on, and not depend on you?\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nTherefore I took your hands; but was indeed\r\nSway’d from the point, by looking down on Caesar.\r\nFriends am I with you all, and love you all,\r\nUpon this hope, that you shall give me reasons\r\nWhy, and wherein, Caesar was dangerous.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nOr else were this a savage spectacle.\r\nOur reasons are so full of good regard\r\nThat were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,\r\nYou should be satisfied.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nThat’s all I seek,\r\nAnd am moreover suitor that I may\r\nProduce his body to the market-place;\r\nAnd in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,\r\nSpeak in the order of his funeral.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nYou shall, Mark Antony.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nBrutus, a word with you.\r\n[_Aside to Brutus._] You know not what you do. Do not consent\r\nThat Antony speak in his funeral.\r\nKnow you how much the people may be mov’d\r\nBy that which he will utter?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\n[_Aside to Cassius._] By your pardon:\r\nI will myself into the pulpit first,\r\nAnd show the reason of our Caesar’s death.\r\nWhat Antony shall speak, I will protest\r\nHe speaks by leave and by permission;\r\nAnd that we are contented Caesar shall\r\nHave all true rights and lawful ceremonies.\r\nIt shall advantage more than do us wrong.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\n[_Aside to Brutus._] I know not what may fall; I like it not.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nMark Antony, here, take you Caesar’s body.\r\nYou shall not in your funeral speech blame us,\r\nBut speak all good you can devise of Caesar,\r\nAnd say you do’t by our permission;\r\nElse shall you not have any hand at all\r\nAbout his funeral. And you shall speak\r\nIn the same pulpit whereto I am going,\r\nAfter my speech is ended.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nBe it so;\r\nI do desire no more.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nPrepare the body, then, and follow us.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt all but Antony._]\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nO, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,\r\nThat I am meek and gentle with these butchers.\r\nThou art the ruins of the noblest man\r\nThat ever lived in the tide of times.\r\nWoe to the hand that shed this costly blood!\r\nOver thy wounds now do I prophesy,\r\nWhich, like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips\r\nTo beg the voice and utterance of my tongue,\r\nA curse shall light upon the limbs of men;\r\nDomestic fury and fierce civil strife\r\nShall cumber all the parts of Italy;\r\nBlood and destruction shall be so in use,\r\nAnd dreadful objects so familiar,\r\nThat mothers shall but smile when they behold\r\nTheir infants quartered with the hands of war;\r\nAll pity chok’d with custom of fell deeds:\r\nAnd Caesar’s spirit, ranging for revenge,\r\nWith Ate by his side come hot from Hell,\r\nShall in these confines with a monarch’s voice\r\nCry havoc and let slip the dogs of war,\r\nThat this foul deed shall smell above the earth\r\nWith carrion men, groaning for burial.\r\n\r\nEnter a Servant.\r\n\r\nYou serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nI do, Mark Antony.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nCaesar did write for him to come to Rome.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nHe did receive his letters, and is coming,\r\nAnd bid me say to you by word of mouth,—\r\n[_Seeing the body._] O Caesar!\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nThy heart is big, get thee apart and weep.\r\nPassion, I see, is catching; for mine eyes,\r\nSeeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,\r\nBegan to water. Is thy master coming?\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nHe lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nPost back with speed, and tell him what hath chanc’d.\r\nHere is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,\r\nNo Rome of safety for Octavius yet.\r\nHie hence, and tell him so. Yet stay awhile;\r\nThou shalt not back till I have borne this corse\r\nInto the market-place: there shall I try,\r\nIn my oration, how the people take\r\nThe cruel issue of these bloody men;\r\nAccording to the which thou shalt discourse\r\nTo young Octavius of the state of things.\r\nLend me your hand.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt with Caesar’s body._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. The same. The Forum.\r\n\r\nEnter Brutus and goes into the pulpit, and Cassius, with a throng of\r\nCitizens.\r\n\r\nCITIZENS.\r\nWe will be satisfied; let us be satisfied.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nThen follow me, and give me audience, friends.\r\nCassius, go you into the other street\r\nAnd part the numbers.\r\nThose that will hear me speak, let ’em stay here;\r\nThose that will follow Cassius, go with him;\r\nAnd public reasons shall be rendered\r\nOf Caesar’s death.\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nI will hear Brutus speak.\r\n\r\nSECOND CITIZEN.\r\nI will hear Cassius; and compare their reasons,\r\nWhen severally we hear them rendered.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Cassius, with some of the Citizens. Brutus goes into the\r\nrostrum._]\r\n\r\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\r\nThe noble Brutus is ascended: silence!\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nBe patient till the last.\r\nRomans, countrymen, and lovers, hear me for my cause; and be silent,\r\nthat you may hear. Believe me for mine honour, and have respect to mine\r\nhonour, that you may believe. Censure me in your wisdom, and awake your\r\nsenses, that you may the better judge. If there be any in this\r\nassembly, any dear friend of Caesar’s, to him I say that Brutus’ love\r\nto Caesar was no less than his. If then that friend demand why Brutus\r\nrose against Caesar, this is my answer: Not that I loved Caesar less,\r\nbut that I loved Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living, and die\r\nall slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all free men? As Caesar\r\nloved me, I weep for him; as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he\r\nwas valiant, I honour him; but, as he was ambitious, I slew him. There\r\nis tears, for his love; joy for his fortune; honour for his valour; and\r\ndeath, for his ambition. Who is here so base, that would be a bondman?\r\nIf any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so rude, that would\r\nnot be a Roman? If any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so\r\nvile, that will not love his country? If any, speak; for him have I\r\noffended. I pause for a reply.\r\n\r\nCITIZENS.\r\nNone, Brutus, none.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nThen none have I offended. I have done no more to Caesar than you shall\r\ndo to Brutus. The question of his death is enroll’d in the Capitol, his\r\nglory not extenuated, wherein he was worthy; nor his offences enforc’d,\r\nfor which he suffered death.\r\n\r\nEnter Antony and others, with Caesar’s body.\r\n\r\nHere comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he had no hand\r\nin his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying, a place in the\r\ncommonwealth; as which of you shall not? With this I depart, that, as I\r\nslew my best lover for the good of Rome, I have the same dagger for\r\nmyself, when it shall please my country to need my death.\r\n\r\nCITIZENS.\r\nLive, Brutus! live, live!\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nBring him with triumph home unto his house.\r\n\r\nSECOND CITIZEN.\r\nGive him a statue with his ancestors.\r\n\r\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\r\nLet him be Caesar.\r\n\r\nFOURTH CITIZEN.\r\nCaesar’s better parts\r\nShall be crown’d in Brutus.\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nWe’ll bring him to his house with shouts and clamours.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nMy countrymen,—\r\n\r\nSECOND CITIZEN.\r\nPeace! Silence! Brutus speaks.\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nPeace, ho!\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nGood countrymen, let me depart alone,\r\nAnd, for my sake, stay here with Antony.\r\nDo grace to Caesar’s corpse, and grace his speech\r\nTending to Caesar’s glories, which Mark Antony,\r\nBy our permission, is allow’d to make.\r\nI do entreat you, not a man depart,\r\nSave I alone, till Antony have spoke.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nStay, ho! and let us hear Mark Antony.\r\n\r\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\r\nLet him go up into the public chair.\r\nWe’ll hear him. Noble Antony, go up.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nFor Brutus’ sake, I am beholding to you.\r\n\r\n[_Goes up._]\r\n\r\nFOURTH CITIZEN.\r\nWhat does he say of Brutus?\r\n\r\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\r\nHe says, for Brutus’ sake\r\nHe finds himself beholding to us all.\r\n\r\nFOURTH CITIZEN.\r\n’Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here!\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nThis Caesar was a tyrant.\r\n\r\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\r\nNay, that’s certain.\r\nWe are blest that Rome is rid of him.\r\n\r\nSECOND CITIZEN.\r\nPeace! let us hear what Antony can say.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nYou gentle Romans,—\r\n\r\nCITIZENS.\r\nPeace, ho! let us hear him.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nFriends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;\r\nI come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.\r\nThe evil that men do lives after them,\r\nThe good is oft interred with their bones;\r\nSo let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus\r\nHath told you Caesar was ambitious.\r\nIf it were so, it was a grievous fault,\r\nAnd grievously hath Caesar answer’d it.\r\nHere, under leave of Brutus and the rest,\r\nFor Brutus is an honourable man,\r\nSo are they all, all honourable men,\r\nCome I to speak in Caesar’s funeral.\r\nHe was my friend, faithful and just to me;\r\nBut Brutus says he was ambitious,\r\nAnd Brutus is an honourable man.\r\nHe hath brought many captives home to Rome,\r\nWhose ransoms did the general coffers fill:\r\nDid this in Caesar seem ambitious?\r\nWhen that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept;\r\nAmbition should be made of sterner stuff:\r\nYet Brutus says he was ambitious;\r\nAnd Brutus is an honourable man.\r\nYou all did see that on the Lupercal\r\nI thrice presented him a kingly crown,\r\nWhich he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition?\r\nYet Brutus says he was ambitious;\r\nAnd sure he is an honourable man.\r\nI speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,\r\nBut here I am to speak what I do know.\r\nYou all did love him once, not without cause;\r\nWhat cause withholds you then to mourn for him?\r\nO judgement, thou art fled to brutish beasts,\r\nAnd men have lost their reason. Bear with me.\r\nMy heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,\r\nAnd I must pause till it come back to me.\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nMethinks there is much reason in his sayings.\r\n\r\nSECOND CITIZEN.\r\nIf thou consider rightly of the matter,\r\nCaesar has had great wrong.\r\n\r\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\r\nHas he, masters?\r\nI fear there will a worse come in his place.\r\n\r\nFOURTH CITIZEN.\r\nMark’d ye his words? He would not take the crown;\r\nTherefore ’tis certain he was not ambitious.\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nIf it be found so, some will dear abide it.\r\n\r\nSECOND CITIZEN.\r\nPoor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping.\r\n\r\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\r\nThere’s not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.\r\n\r\nFOURTH CITIZEN.\r\nNow mark him; he begins again to speak.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nBut yesterday the word of Caesar might\r\nHave stood against the world; now lies he there,\r\nAnd none so poor to do him reverence.\r\nO masters! If I were dispos’d to stir\r\nYour hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,\r\nI should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong,\r\nWho, you all know, are honourable men.\r\nI will not do them wrong; I rather choose\r\nTo wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,\r\nThan I will wrong such honourable men.\r\nBut here’s a parchment with the seal of Caesar,\r\nI found it in his closet; ’tis his will:\r\nLet but the commons hear this testament,\r\nWhich, pardon me, I do not mean to read,\r\nAnd they would go and kiss dead Caesar’s wounds,\r\nAnd dip their napkins in his sacred blood;\r\nYea, beg a hair of him for memory,\r\nAnd, dying, mention it within their wills,\r\nBequeathing it as a rich legacy\r\nUnto their issue.\r\n\r\nFOURTH CITIZEN.\r\nWe’ll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony.\r\n\r\nCITIZENS.\r\nThe will, the will! We will hear Caesar’s will.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nHave patience, gentle friends, I must not read it.\r\nIt is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.\r\nYou are not wood, you are not stones, but men;\r\nAnd being men, hearing the will of Caesar,\r\nIt will inflame you, it will make you mad.\r\n’Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;\r\nFor if you should, O, what would come of it?\r\n\r\nFOURTH CITIZEN.\r\nRead the will! We’ll hear it, Antony;\r\nYou shall read us the will, Caesar’s will!\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nWill you be patient? Will you stay awhile?\r\nI have o’ershot myself to tell you of it.\r\nI fear I wrong the honourable men\r\nWhose daggers have stabb’d Caesar; I do fear it.\r\n\r\nFOURTH CITIZEN.\r\nThey were traitors. Honourable men!\r\n\r\nCITIZENS.\r\nThe will! The testament!\r\n\r\nSECOND CITIZEN.\r\nThey were villains, murderers. The will! Read the will!\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nYou will compel me then to read the will?\r\nThen make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,\r\nAnd let me show you him that made the will.\r\nShall I descend? and will you give me leave?\r\n\r\nCITIZENS.\r\nCome down.\r\n\r\nSECOND CITIZEN.\r\nDescend.\r\n\r\n[_He comes down._]\r\n\r\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\r\nYou shall have leave.\r\n\r\nFOURTH CITIZEN.\r\nA ring! Stand round.\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nStand from the hearse, stand from the body.\r\n\r\nSECOND CITIZEN.\r\nRoom for Antony, most noble Antony!\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nNay, press not so upon me; stand far off.\r\n\r\nCITIZENS.\r\nStand back; room! bear back.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nIf you have tears, prepare to shed them now.\r\nYou all do know this mantle. I remember\r\nThe first time ever Caesar put it on;\r\n’Twas on a Summer’s evening, in his tent,\r\nThat day he overcame the Nervii.\r\nLook, in this place ran Cassius’ dagger through:\r\nSee what a rent the envious Casca made:\r\nThrough this the well-beloved Brutus stabb’d;\r\nAnd as he pluck’d his cursed steel away,\r\nMark how the blood of Caesar follow’d it,\r\nAs rushing out of doors, to be resolv’d\r\nIf Brutus so unkindly knock’d, or no;\r\nFor Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel.\r\nJudge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar lov’d him.\r\nThis was the most unkindest cut of all;\r\nFor when the noble Caesar saw him stab,\r\nIngratitude, more strong than traitors’ arms,\r\nQuite vanquish’d him: then burst his mighty heart;\r\nAnd in his mantle muffling up his face,\r\nEven at the base of Pompey’s statue\r\nWhich all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.\r\nO, what a fall was there, my countrymen!\r\nThen I, and you, and all of us fell down,\r\nWhilst bloody treason flourish’d over us.\r\nO, now you weep; and I perceive you feel\r\nThe dint of pity. These are gracious drops.\r\nKind souls, what weep you when you but behold\r\nOur Caesar’s vesture wounded? Look you here,\r\nHere is himself, marr’d, as you see, with traitors.\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nO piteous spectacle!\r\n\r\nSECOND CITIZEN.\r\nO noble Caesar!\r\n\r\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\r\nO woeful day!\r\n\r\nFOURTH CITIZEN.\r\nO traitors, villains!\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nO most bloody sight!\r\n\r\nSECOND CITIZEN.\r\nWe will be revenged.\r\n\r\nCITIZENS.\r\nRevenge,—about,—seek,—burn,—fire,—kill,—slay,—let not a traitor live!\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nStay, countrymen.\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nPeace there! Hear the noble Antony.\r\n\r\nSECOND CITIZEN.\r\nWe’ll hear him, we’ll follow him, we’ll die with him.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nGood friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up\r\nTo such a sudden flood of mutiny.\r\nThey that have done this deed are honourable.\r\nWhat private griefs they have, alas, I know not,\r\nThat made them do it. They’re wise and honourable,\r\nAnd will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.\r\nI come not, friends, to steal away your hearts.\r\nI am no orator, as Brutus is;\r\nBut, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,\r\nThat love my friend; and that they know full well\r\nThat gave me public leave to speak of him.\r\nFor I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,\r\nAction, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,\r\nTo stir men’s blood. I only speak right on.\r\nI tell you that which you yourselves do know,\r\nShow you sweet Caesar’s wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,\r\nAnd bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus,\r\nAnd Brutus Antony, there were an Antony\r\nWould ruffle up your spirits, and put a tongue\r\nIn every wound of Caesar, that should move\r\nThe stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.\r\n\r\nCITIZENS.\r\nWe’ll mutiny.\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nWe’ll burn the house of Brutus.\r\n\r\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\r\nAway, then! come, seek the conspirators.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nYet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.\r\n\r\nCITIZENS.\r\nPeace, ho! Hear Antony; most noble Antony.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nWhy, friends, you go to do you know not what.\r\nWherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?\r\nAlas, you know not; I must tell you then.\r\nYou have forgot the will I told you of.\r\n\r\nCITIZENS.\r\nMost true; the will!—let’s stay, and hear the will.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nHere is the will, and under Caesar’s seal.\r\nTo every Roman citizen he gives,\r\nTo every several man, seventy-five drachmas.\r\n\r\nSECOND CITIZEN.\r\nMost noble Caesar! We’ll revenge his death.\r\n\r\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\r\nO, royal Caesar!\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nHear me with patience.\r\n\r\nCITIZENS.\r\nPeace, ho!\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nMoreover, he hath left you all his walks,\r\nHis private arbors, and new-planted orchards,\r\nOn this side Tiber; he hath left them you,\r\nAnd to your heirs forever; common pleasures,\r\nTo walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.\r\nHere was a Caesar! when comes such another?\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nNever, never. Come, away, away!\r\nWe’ll burn his body in the holy place,\r\nAnd with the brands fire the traitors’ houses.\r\nTake up the body.\r\n\r\nSECOND CITIZEN.\r\nGo, fetch fire.\r\n\r\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\r\nPluck down benches.\r\n\r\nFOURTH CITIZEN.\r\nPluck down forms, windows, anything.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Citizens, with the body._]\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nNow let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,\r\nTake thou what course thou wilt!\r\n\r\nEnter a Servant.\r\n\r\nHow now, fellow?\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nSir, Octavius is already come to Rome.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nWhere is he?\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nHe and Lepidus are at Caesar’s house.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nAnd thither will I straight to visit him.\r\nHe comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry,\r\nAnd in this mood will give us anything.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nI heard him say Brutus and Cassius\r\nAre rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nBelike they had some notice of the people,\r\nHow I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. The same. A street.\r\n\r\nEnter Cinna, the poet, and after him the citizens.\r\n\r\nCINNA.\r\nI dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar,\r\nAnd things unluckily charge my fantasy.\r\nI have no will to wander forth of doors,\r\nYet something leads me forth.\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nWhat is your name?\r\n\r\nSECOND CITIZEN.\r\nWhither are you going?\r\n\r\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\r\nWhere do you dwell?\r\n\r\nFOURTH CITIZEN.\r\nAre you a married man or a bachelor?\r\n\r\nSECOND CITIZEN.\r\nAnswer every man directly.\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nAy, and briefly.\r\n\r\nFOURTH CITIZEN.\r\nAy, and wisely.\r\n\r\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\r\nAy, and truly, you were best.\r\n\r\nCINNA.\r\nWhat is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I dwell? Am I a married\r\nman or a bachelor? Then, to answer every man directly and briefly,\r\nwisely and truly. Wisely I say I am a bachelor.\r\n\r\nSECOND CITIZEN.\r\nThat’s as much as to say they are fools that marry; you’ll bear me a\r\nbang for that, I fear. Proceed, directly.\r\n\r\nCINNA.\r\nDirectly, I am going to Caesar’s funeral.\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nAs a friend, or an enemy?\r\n\r\nCINNA.\r\nAs a friend.\r\n\r\nSECOND CITIZEN.\r\nThat matter is answered directly.\r\n\r\nFOURTH CITIZEN.\r\nFor your dwelling, briefly.\r\n\r\nCINNA.\r\nBriefly, I dwell by the Capitol.\r\n\r\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\r\nYour name, sir, truly.\r\n\r\nCINNA.\r\nTruly, my name is Cinna.\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nTear him to pieces! He’s a conspirator.\r\n\r\nCINNA.\r\nI am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet.\r\n\r\nFOURTH CITIZEN.\r\nTear him for his bad verses, tear him for his bad verses.\r\n\r\nCINNA.\r\nI am not Cinna the conspirator.\r\n\r\nFOURTH CITIZEN.\r\nIt is no matter, his name’s Cinna; pluck but his name out of his heart,\r\nand turn him going.\r\n\r\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\r\nTear him, tear him! Come; brands, ho! firebrands. To Brutus’, to\r\nCassius’; burn all. Some to Decius’ house, and some to Casca’s, some to\r\nLigarius’. Away, go!\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\nACT IV\r\n\r\nSCENE I. Rome.

Is it fit,\r\nThe three-fold world divided, he should stand\r\nOne of the three to share it?\r\n\r\nOCTAVIUS.\r\nSo you thought him,\r\nAnd took his voice who should be prick’d to die\r\nIn our black sentence and proscription.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nOctavius, I have seen more days than you;\r\nAnd though we lay these honours on this man,\r\nTo ease ourselves of divers sland’rous loads,\r\nHe shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,\r\nTo groan and sweat under the business,\r\nEither led or driven, as we point the way;\r\nAnd having brought our treasure where we will,\r\nThen take we down his load, and turn him off,\r\nLike to the empty ass, to shake his ears,\r\nAnd graze in commons.\r\n\r\nOCTAVIUS.\r\nYou may do your will;\r\nBut he’s a tried and valiant soldier.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nSo is my horse, Octavius; and for that\r\nI do appoint him store of provender.\r\nIt is a creature that I teach to fight,\r\nTo wind, to stop, to run directly on,\r\nHis corporal motion govern’d by my spirit.\r\nAnd, in some taste, is Lepidus but so:\r\nHe must be taught, and train’d, and bid go forth:\r\nA barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds\r\nOn objects, arts, and imitations,\r\nWhich, out of use and stal’d by other men,\r\nBegin his fashion. Do not talk of him\r\nBut as a property. And now, Octavius,\r\nListen great things. Brutus and Cassius\r\nAre levying powers; we must straight make head.\r\nTherefore let our alliance be combin’d,\r\nOur best friends made, our means stretch’d;\r\nAnd let us presently go sit in council,\r\nHow covert matters may be best disclos’d,\r\nAnd open perils surest answered.\r\n\r\nOCTAVIUS.\r\nLet us do so: for we are at the stake,\r\nAnd bay’d about with many enemies;\r\nAnd some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,\r\nMillions of mischiefs.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II.

Your master, Pindarus,\r\nIn his own change, or by ill officers,\r\nHath given me some worthy cause to wish\r\nThings done, undone: but, if he be at hand,\r\nI shall be satisfied.\r\n\r\nPINDARUS.\r\nI do not doubt\r\nBut that my noble master will appear\r\nSuch as he is, full of regard and honour.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nHe is not doubted. A word, Lucilius;\r\nHow he received you, let me be resolv’d.\r\n\r\nLUCILIUS.\r\nWith courtesy and with respect enough,\r\nBut not with such familiar instances,\r\nNor with such free and friendly conference,\r\nAs he hath us’d of old.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nThou hast describ’d\r\nA hot friend cooling. Ever note, Lucilius,\r\nWhen love begins to sicken and decay\r\nIt useth an enforced ceremony.\r\nThere are no tricks in plain and simple faith;\r\nBut hollow men, like horses hot at hand,\r\nMake gallant show and promise of their mettle;\r\n\r\n[_Low march within._]\r\n\r\nBut when they should endure the bloody spur,\r\nThey fall their crests, and like deceitful jades\r\nSink in the trial.

What! Shall one of us,\r\nThat struck the foremost man of all this world\r\nBut for supporting robbers, shall we now\r\nContaminate our fingers with base bribes,\r\nAnd sell the mighty space of our large honours\r\nFor so much trash as may be grasped thus?\r\nI had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,\r\nThan such a Roman.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nBrutus, bait not me,\r\nI’ll not endure it. You forget yourself,\r\nTo hedge me in. I am a soldier, I,\r\nOlder in practice, abler than yourself\r\nTo make conditions.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nGo to; you are not, Cassius.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nI am.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nI say you are not.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nUrge me no more, I shall forget myself;\r\nHave mind upon your health, tempt me no farther.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nAway, slight man!\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nIs’t possible?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nHear me, for I will speak.\r\nMust I give way and room to your rash choler?\r\nShall I be frighted when a madman stares?\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nO ye gods, ye gods! Must I endure all this?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nAll this? ay, more: fret till your proud heart break;\r\nGo show your slaves how choleric you are,\r\nAnd make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?\r\nMust I observe you? Must I stand and crouch\r\nUnder your testy humour? By the gods,\r\nYou shall digest the venom of your spleen,\r\nThough it do split you; for, from this day forth,\r\nI’ll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,\r\nWhen you are waspish.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nIs it come to this?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nYou say you are a better soldier:\r\nLet it appear so; make your vaunting true,\r\nAnd it shall please me well. For mine own part,\r\nI shall be glad to learn of noble men.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nYou wrong me every way, you wrong me, Brutus.\r\nI said, an elder soldier, not a better:\r\nDid I say better?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nIf you did, I care not.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nWhen Caesar liv’d, he durst not thus have mov’d me.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nPeace, peace! you durst not so have tempted him.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nI durst not?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nWhat? durst not tempt him?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nFor your life you durst not.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nDo not presume too much upon my love.\r\nI may do that I shall be sorry for.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nYou have done that you should be sorry for.\r\nThere is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,\r\nFor I am arm’d so strong in honesty,\r\nThat they pass by me as the idle wind,\r\nWhich I respect not. I did send to you\r\nFor certain sums of gold, which you denied me;\r\nFor I can raise no money by vile means:\r\nBy Heaven, I had rather coin my heart,\r\nAnd drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring\r\nFrom the hard hands of peasants their vile trash\r\nBy any indirection. I did send\r\nTo you for gold to pay my legions,\r\nWhich you denied me: was that done like Cassius?\r\nShould I have answer’d Caius Cassius so?\r\nWhen Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,\r\nTo lock such rascal counters from his friends,\r\nBe ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts,\r\nDash him to pieces!\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nI denied you not.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nYou did.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nI did not. He was but a fool\r\nThat brought my answer back. Brutus hath riv’d my heart.\r\nA friend should bear his friend’s infirmities;\r\nBut Brutus makes mine greater than they are.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nI do not, till you practise them on me.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nYou love me not.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nI do not like your faults.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nA friendly eye could never see such faults.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nA flatterer’s would not, though they do appear\r\nAs huge as high Olympus.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nCome, Antony, and young Octavius, come,\r\nRevenge yourselves alone on Cassius,\r\nFor Cassius is a-weary of the world:\r\nHated by one he loves; brav’d by his brother;\r\nCheck’d like a bondman; all his faults observ’d,\r\nSet in a note-book, learn’d and conn’d by rote,\r\nTo cast into my teeth. O, I could weep\r\nMy spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,\r\nAnd here my naked breast; within, a heart\r\nDearer than Plutus’ mine, richer than gold:\r\nIf that thou be’st a Roman, take it forth.\r\nI, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:\r\nStrike as thou didst at Caesar; for I know,\r\nWhen thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better\r\nThan ever thou lovedst Cassius.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nSheathe your dagger.\r\nBe angry when you will, it shall have scope;\r\nDo what you will, dishonour shall be humour.\r\nO Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb\r\nThat carries anger as the flint bears fire,\r\nWho, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,\r\nAnd straight is cold again.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nHath Cassius liv’d\r\nTo be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,\r\nWhen grief and blood ill-temper’d vexeth him?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nWhen I spoke that, I was ill-temper’d too.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nDo you confess so much? Give me your hand.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nAnd my heart too.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nO Brutus!\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nWhat’s the matter?\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nHave not you love enough to bear with me,\r\nWhen that rash humour which my mother gave me\r\nMakes me forgetful?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nYes, Cassius; and from henceforth,\r\nWhen you are over-earnest with your Brutus,\r\nHe’ll think your mother chides, and leave you so.\r\n\r\nEnter Poet, followed by Lucilius, Titinius and Lucius.\r\n\r\nPOET.\r\n[_Within._] Let me go in to see the generals,\r\nThere is some grudge between ’em; ’tis not meet\r\nThey be alone.\r\n\r\nLUCILIUS.\r\n[_Within._] You shall not come to them.\r\n\r\nPOET.\r\n[_Within._] Nothing but death shall stay me.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nHow now! What’s the matter?\r\n\r\nPOET.\r\nFor shame, you generals! What do you mean?\r\nLove, and be friends, as two such men should be;\r\nFor I have seen more years, I’m sure, than ye.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nHa, ha! How vilely doth this cynic rhyme!\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nGet you hence, sirrah. Saucy fellow, hence!\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nBear with him, Brutus; ’tis his fashion.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nI’ll know his humour when he knows his time.\r\nWhat should the wars do with these jigging fools?\r\nCompanion, hence!\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nAway, away, be gone!\r\n\r\n[_Exit Poet._]\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nLucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders\r\nPrepare to lodge their companies tonight.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nAnd come yourselves and bring Messala with you\r\nImmediately to us.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Lucilius and Titinius._]\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nLucius, a bowl of wine.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Lucius._]\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nI did not think you could have been so angry.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nO Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nOf your philosophy you make no use,\r\nIf you give place to accidental evils.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nNo man bears sorrow better.

What do you think\r\nOf marching to Philippi presently?\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nI do not think it good.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nYour reason?\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nThis it is:\r\n’Tis better that the enemy seek us;\r\nSo shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,\r\nDoing himself offence, whilst we, lying still,\r\nAre full of rest, defence, and nimbleness.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nGood reasons must of force give place to better.\r\nThe people ’twixt Philippi and this ground\r\nDo stand but in a forced affection;\r\nFor they have grudg’d us contribution.\r\nThe enemy, marching along by them,\r\nBy them shall make a fuller number up,\r\nCome on refresh’d, new-added, and encourag’d;\r\nFrom which advantage shall we cut him off\r\nIf at Philippi we do face him there,\r\nThese people at our back.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nHear me, good brother.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nUnder your pardon. You must note besides,\r\nThat we have tried the utmost of our friends,\r\nOur legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe.\r\nThe enemy increaseth every day;\r\nWe, at the height, are ready to decline.\r\nThere is a tide in the affairs of men,\r\nWhich, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;\r\nOmitted, all the voyage of their life\r\nIs bound in shallows and in miseries.\r\nOn such a full sea are we now afloat,\r\nAnd we must take the current when it serves,\r\nOr lose our ventures.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nThen, with your will, go on:\r\nWe’ll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nThe deep of night is crept upon our talk,\r\nAnd nature must obey necessity,\r\nWhich we will niggard with a little rest.\r\nThere is no more to say?\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nNo more.

They could be content\r\nTo visit other places, and come down\r\nWith fearful bravery, thinking by this face\r\nTo fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;\r\nBut ’tis not so.\r\n\r\nEnter a Messenger.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nPrepare you, generals.\r\nThe enemy comes on in gallant show;\r\nTheir bloody sign of battle is hung out,\r\nAnd something to be done immediately.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nOctavius, lead your battle softly on\r\nUpon the left hand of the even field.\r\n\r\nOCTAVIUS.\r\nUpon the right hand I.

Hail, Caesar!”\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nAntony,\r\nThe posture of your blows are yet unknown;\r\nBut for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,\r\nAnd leave them honeyless.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nNot stingless too.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nO yes, and soundless too,\r\nFor you have stol’n their buzzing, Antony,\r\nAnd very wisely threat before you sting.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nVillains, you did not so when your vile daggers\r\nHack’d one another in the sides of Caesar:\r\nYou show’d your teeth like apes, and fawn’d like hounds,\r\nAnd bow’d like bondmen, kissing Caesar’s feet;\r\nWhilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind\r\nStruck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nFlatterers! Now, Brutus, thank yourself.\r\nThis tongue had not offended so today,\r\nIf Cassius might have rul’d.\r\n\r\nOCTAVIUS.\r\nCome, come, the cause. If arguing makes us sweat,\r\nThe proof of it will turn to redder drops.\r\nLook, I draw a sword against conspirators.\r\nWhen think you that the sword goes up again?\r\nNever, till Caesar’s three and thirty wounds\r\nBe well aveng’d; or till another Caesar\r\nHave added slaughter to the sword of traitors.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nCaesar, thou canst not die by traitors’ hands,\r\nUnless thou bring’st them with thee.\r\n\r\nOCTAVIUS.\r\nSo I hope.\r\nI was not born to die on Brutus’ sword.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nO, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,\r\nYoung man, thou couldst not die more honourable.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nA peevish school-boy, worthless of such honour,\r\nJoin’d with a masker and a reveller.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nOld Cassius still!\r\n\r\nOCTAVIUS.\r\nCome, Antony; away!\r\nDefiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth.\r\nIf you dare fight today, come to the field;\r\nIf not, when you have stomachs.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Octavius, Antony and their Army._]\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nWhy now, blow wind, swell billow, and swim bark!\r\nThe storm is up, and all is on the hazard.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nHo, Lucilius!

Give me thy hand, Messala:\r\nBe thou my witness that against my will\r\nAs Pompey was, am I compell’d to set\r\nUpon one battle all our liberties.\r\nYou know that I held Epicurus strong,\r\nAnd his opinion. Now I change my mind,\r\nAnd partly credit things that do presage.\r\nComing from Sardis, on our former ensign\r\nTwo mighty eagles fell, and there they perch’d,\r\nGorging and feeding from our soldiers’ hands,\r\nWho to Philippi here consorted us.\r\nThis morning are they fled away and gone,\r\nAnd in their steads do ravens, crows, and kites\r\nFly o’er our heads, and downward look on us,\r\nAs we were sickly prey: their shadows seem\r\nA canopy most fatal, under which\r\nOur army lies, ready to give up the ghost.\r\n\r\nMESSALA.\r\nBelieve not so.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nI but believe it partly,\r\nFor I am fresh of spirit, and resolv’d\r\nTo meet all perils very constantly.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nEven so, Lucilius.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nNow, most noble Brutus,\r\nThe gods today stand friendly, that we may,\r\nLovers in peace, lead on our days to age!\r\nBut, since the affairs of men rest still incertain,\r\nLet’s reason with the worst that may befall.\r\nIf we do lose this battle, then is this\r\nThe very last time we shall speak together:\r\nWhat are you then determined to do?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nEven by the rule of that philosophy\r\nBy which I did blame Cato for the death\r\nWhich he did give himself, I know not how,\r\nBut I do find it cowardly and vile,\r\nFor fear of what might fall, so to prevent\r\nThe time of life, arming myself with patience\r\nTo stay the providence of some high powers\r\nThat govern us below.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nThen, if we lose this battle,\r\nYou are contented to be led in triumph\r\nThorough the streets of Rome?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nNo, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,\r\nThat ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;\r\nHe bears too great a mind. But this same day\r\nMust end that work the Ides of March begun;\r\nAnd whether we shall meet again I know not.\r\nTherefore our everlasting farewell take.\r\nFor ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius.\r\nIf we do meet again, why, we shall smile;\r\nIf not, why then this parting was well made.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nFor ever and for ever farewell, Brutus.\r\nIf we do meet again, we’ll smile indeed;\r\nIf not, ’tis true this parting was well made.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nWhy then, lead on. O, that a man might know\r\nThe end of this day’s business ere it come!\r\nBut it sufficeth that the day will end,\r\nAnd then the end is known. Come, ho! away!\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II.

Look, look, Titinius;\r\nAre those my tents where I perceive the fire?\r\n\r\nTITINIUS.\r\nThey are, my lord.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nTitinius, if thou lovest me,\r\nMount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him,\r\nTill he have brought thee up to yonder troops\r\nAnd here again, that I may rest assur’d\r\nWhether yond troops are friend or enemy.\r\n\r\nTITINIUS.\r\nI will be here again, even with a thought.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nGo, Pindarus, get higher on that hill,\r\nMy sight was ever thick. Regard Titinius,\r\nAnd tell me what thou notest about the field.\r\n\r\n[_Pindarus goes up._]\r\n\r\nThis day I breathed first. Time is come round,\r\nAnd where I did begin, there shall I end.\r\nMy life is run his compass. Sirrah, what news?\r\n\r\nPINDARUS.\r\n[_Above._] O my lord!\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nWhat news?\r\n\r\nPINDARUS.\r\n[_Above._] Titinius is enclosed round about\r\nWith horsemen, that make to him on the spur,\r\nYet he spurs on. Now they are almost on him.\r\nNow, Titinius! Now some light. O, he lights too.\r\nHe’s ta’en!\r\n\r\n[_Shout._]\r\n\r\nAnd, hark! they shout for joy.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nCome down; behold no more.\r\nO, coward that I am, to live so long,\r\nTo see my best friend ta’en before my face!\r\n\r\n[_Pindarus descends._]\r\n\r\nCome hither, sirrah.\r\nIn Parthia did I take thee prisoner;\r\nAnd then I swore thee, saving of thy life,\r\nThat whatsoever I did bid thee do,\r\nThou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath.\r\nNow be a freeman; and with this good sword,\r\nThat ran through Caesar’s bowels, search this bosom.\r\nStand not to answer. Here, take thou the hilts;\r\nAnd when my face is cover’d, as ’tis now,\r\nGuide thou the sword.—Caesar, thou art reveng’d,\r\nEven with the sword that kill’d thee.\r\n\r\n[_Dies._]\r\n\r\nPINDARUS.\r\nSo, I am free, yet would not so have been,\r\nDurst I have done my will. O Cassius!\r\nFar from this country Pindarus shall run,\r\nWhere never Roman shall take note of him.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nEnter Titinius with Messala.\r\n\r\nMESSALA.\r\nIt is but change, Titinius; for Octavius\r\nIs overthrown by noble Brutus’ power,\r\nAs Cassius’ legions are by Antony.\r\n\r\nTITINIUS.\r\nThese tidings would well comfort Cassius.\r\n\r\nMESSALA.\r\nWhere did you leave him?\r\n\r\nTITINIUS.\r\nAll disconsolate,\r\nWith Pindarus his bondman, on this hill.\r\n\r\nMESSALA.\r\nIs not that he that lies upon the ground?\r\n\r\nTITINIUS.\r\nHe lies not like the living. O my heart!\r\n\r\nMESSALA.\r\nIs not that he?\r\n\r\nTITINIUS.\r\nNo, this was he, Messala,\r\nBut Cassius is no more. O setting sun,\r\nAs in thy red rays thou dost sink to night,\r\nSo in his red blood Cassius’ day is set.\r\nThe sun of Rome is set. Our day is gone;\r\nClouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are done.\r\nMistrust of my success hath done this deed.\r\n\r\nMESSALA.\r\nMistrust of good success hath done this deed.\r\nO hateful Error, Melancholy’s child!\r\nWhy dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men\r\nThe things that are not? O Error, soon conceiv’d,\r\nThou never com’st unto a happy birth,\r\nBut kill’st the mother that engender’d thee!\r\n\r\nTITINIUS.\r\nWhat, Pindarus! where art thou, Pindarus?\r\n\r\nMESSALA.\r\nSeek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet\r\nThe noble Brutus, thrusting this report\r\nInto his ears. I may say thrusting it;\r\nFor piercing steel and darts envenomed\r\nShall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus\r\nAs tidings of this sight.\r\n\r\nTITINIUS.\r\nHie you, Messala,\r\nAnd I will seek for Pindarus the while.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Messala._]\r\n\r\nWhy didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?\r\nDid I not meet thy friends? And did not they\r\nPut on my brows this wreath of victory,\r\nAnd bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?\r\nAlas, thou hast misconstrued everything!\r\nBut, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;\r\nThy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I\r\nWill do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,\r\nAnd see how I regarded Caius Cassius.\r\nBy your leave, gods. This is a Roman’s part.\r\nCome, Cassius’ sword, and find Titinius’ heart.\r\n\r\n[_Dies._]\r\n\r\nAlarum.

Friends, I owe more tears\r\nTo this dead man than you shall see me pay.\r\nI shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.\r\nCome therefore, and to Thassos send his body.\r\nHis funerals shall not be in our camp,\r\nLest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come;\r\nAnd come, young Cato; let us to the field.\r\nLabeo and Flavius, set our battles on.\r\n’Tis three o’clock; and Romans, yet ere night\r\nWe shall try fortune in a second fight.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV.

Keep this man safe,\r\nGive him all kindness. I had rather have\r\nSuch men my friends than enemies. Go on,\r\nAnd see whether Brutus be alive or dead;\r\nAnd bring us word unto Octavius’ tent\r\nHow everything is chanc’d.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE V.

Wilt thou, Strato?\r\n\r\nSTRATO.\r\nGive me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nFarewell, good Strato.—Caesar, now be still:\r\nI kill’d not thee with half so good a will.\r\n\r\n[_He runs on his sword, and dies._]\r\n\r\nAlarum. Retreat. Enter Antony, Octavius, Messala, Lucilius and the\r\nArmy.\r\n\r\nOCTAVIUS.\r\nWhat man is that?\r\n\r\nMESSALA.\r\nMy master’s man. Strato, where is thy master?\r\n\r\nSTRATO.\r\nFree from the bondage you are in, Messala.\r\nThe conquerors can but make a fire of him;\r\nFor Brutus only overcame himself,\r\nAnd no man else hath honour by his death.\r\n\r\nLUCILIUS.\r\nSo Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,\r\nThat thou hast prov’d Lucilius’ saying true.\r\n\r\nOCTAVIUS.\r\nAll that serv’d Brutus, I will entertain them.\r\nFellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?\r\n\r\nSTRATO.\r\nAy, if Messala will prefer me to you.\r\n\r\nOCTAVIUS.\r\nDo so, good Messala.\r\n\r\nMESSALA.\r\nHow died my master, Strato?\r\n\r\nSTRATO.\r\nI held the sword, and he did run on it.\r\n\r\nMESSALA.\r\nOctavius, then take him to follow thee,\r\nThat did the latest service to my master.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nThis was the noblest Roman of them all.\r\nAll the conspirators save only he,\r\nDid that they did in envy of great Caesar;\r\nHe only, in a general honest thought\r\nAnd common good to all, made one of them.\r\nHis life was gentle, and the elements\r\nSo mix’d in him that Nature might stand up\r\nAnd say to all the world, “This was a man!”\r\n\r\nOCTAVIUS.\r\nAccording to his virtue let us use him\r\nWith all respect and rites of burial.\r\nWithin my tent his bones tonight shall lie,\r\nMost like a soldier, order’d honourably.\r\nSo call the field to rest, and let’s away,\r\nTo part the glories of this happy day.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\nTHE TRAGEDY OF KING LEAR\r\n\nContents\r\n\r\nACT I\r\nScene I.

Do you smell a fault?\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nI cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so proper.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nBut I have a son, sir, by order of law, some year elder than\r\nthis, who yet is no dearer in my account: though this knave came\r\nsomething saucily to the world before he was sent for, yet was\r\nhis mother fair; there was good sport at his making, and the\r\nwhoreson must be acknowledged.

Will you have her?\r\nShe is herself a dowry.\r\n\r\nBURGUNDY.\r\nRoyal King,\r\nGive but that portion which yourself propos’d,\r\nAnd here I take Cordelia by the hand,\r\nDuchess of Burgundy.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nNothing: I have sworn; I am firm.\r\n\r\nBURGUNDY.\r\nI am sorry, then, you have so lost a father\r\nThat you must lose a husband.\r\n\r\nCORDELIA.\r\nPeace be with Burgundy!\r\nSince that respects of fortunes are his love,\r\nI shall not be his wife.\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\nFairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;\r\nMost choice forsaken; and most lov’d, despis’d!\r\nThee and thy virtues here I seize upon:\r\nBe it lawful, I take up what’s cast away.\r\nGods, gods! ’Tis strange that from their cold’st neglect\r\nMy love should kindle to inflam’d respect.\r\nThy dowerless daughter, King, thrown to my chance,\r\nIs queen of us, of ours, and our fair France:\r\nNot all the dukes of waterish Burgundy\r\nCan buy this unpriz’d precious maid of me.\r\nBid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind:\r\nThou losest here, a better where to find.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nThou hast her, France: let her be thine; for we\r\nHave no such daughter, nor shall ever see\r\nThat face of hers again.

A Hall in the Earl of Gloucester’s Castle\r\n\r\n Enter Edmund with a\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nThou, Nature, art my goddess; to thy law\r\nMy services are bound. Wherefore should I\r\nStand in the plague of custom, and permit\r\nThe curiosity of nations to deprive me?\r\nFor that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines\r\nLag of a brother? Why bastard? Wherefore base?\r\nWhen my dimensions are as well compact,\r\nMy mind as generous, and my shape as true\r\nAs honest madam’s issue? Why brand they us\r\nWith base? With baseness? bastardy? Base, base?\r\nWho, in the lusty stealth of nature, take\r\nMore composition and fierce quality\r\nThan doth within a dull stale tired bed\r\nGo to the creating a whole tribe of fops\r\nGot ’tween asleep and wake? Well then,\r\nLegitimate Edgar, I must have your land:\r\nOur father’s love is to the bastard Edmund\r\nAs to the legitimate: fine word: legitimate!\r\nWell, my legitimate, if this letter speed,\r\nAnd my invention thrive, Edmund the base\r\nShall top the legitimate. I grow, I prosper.\r\nNow, gods, stand up for bastards!\r\n\r\n Enter Gloucester.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nKent banish’d thus! and France in choler parted!\r\nAnd the King gone tonight! Prescrib’d his pow’r!\r\nConfin’d to exhibition! All this done\r\nUpon the gad!—Edmund, how now! What news?\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nSo please your lordship, none.\r\n\r\n [_Putting up the letter._]\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nWhy so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nI know no news, my lord.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nWhat paper were you reading?\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nNothing, my lord.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nNo? What needed then that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket? The\r\nquality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself. Let’s see. Come,\r\nif it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nI beseech you, sir, pardon me. It is a letter from my brother that I\r\nhave not all o’er-read; and for so much as I have perus’d, I find it\r\nnot fit for your o’er-looking.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nGive me the letter, sir.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nI shall offend, either to detain or give it. The contents, as in\r\npart I understand them, are to blame.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nLet’s see, let’s see!\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nI hope, for my brother’s justification, he wrote this but as an\r\nessay, or taste of my virtue.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\n[_Reads._] ‘This policy and reverence of age makes the world\r\nbitter to the best of our times; keeps our fortunes from us\r\ntill our oldness cannot relish them. I begin to find an idle\r\nand fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny; who sways\r\nnot as it hath power, but as it is suffered. Come to me, that\r\nof this I may speak more. If our father would sleep till I\r\nwaked him, you should enjoy half his revenue for ever, and live\r\nthe beloved of your brother EDGAR.’\r\nHum! Conspiracy? ‘Sleep till I wake him, you should enjoy half\r\nhis revenue.’—My son Edgar! Had he a hand to write this? A heart\r\nand brain to breed it in? When came this to you? Who brought it?\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nIt was not brought me, my lord, there’s the cunning of it. I\r\nfound it thrown in at the casement of my closet.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nYou know the character to be your brother’s?\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nIf the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear it were his; but\r\nin respect of that, I would fain think it were not.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nIt is his.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nIt is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is not in the\r\ncontents.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nHas he never before sounded you in this business?\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nNever, my lord. But I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit\r\nthat, sons at perfect age, and fathers declined, the father\r\nshould be as ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nO villain, villain! His very opinion in the letter! Abhorred\r\nvillain! Unnatural, detested, brutish villain! worse than\r\nbrutish! Go, sirrah, seek him; I’ll apprehend him. Abominable\r\nvillain, Where is he?\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nI do not well know, my lord. If it shall please you to suspend\r\nyour indignation against my brother till you can derive from him\r\nbetter testimony of his intent, you should run a certain course;\r\nwhere, if you violently proceed against him, mistaking his\r\npurpose, it would make a great gap in your own honour, and shake\r\nin pieces the heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life\r\nfor him, that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your\r\nhonour, and to no other pretence of danger.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nThink you so?\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nIf your honour judge it meet, I will place you where you shall hear us\r\nconfer of this, and by an auricular assurance have your satisfaction,\r\nand that without any further delay than this very evening.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nHe cannot be such a monster.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nNor is not, sure.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nTo his father, that so tenderly and entirely loves him. Heaven\r\nand earth! Edmund, seek him out; wind me into him, I pray you:\r\nframe the business after your own wisdom. I would unstate myself\r\nto be in a due resolution.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nI will seek him, sir, presently; convey the business as I shall\r\nfind means, and acquaint you withal.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nThese late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us:\r\nthough the wisdom of Nature can reason it thus and thus, yet\r\nnature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects. Love cools,\r\nfriendship falls off, brothers divide: in cities, mutinies; in\r\ncountries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond cracked\r\n’twixt son and father. This villain of mine comes under the\r\nprediction; there’s son against father: the King falls from\r\nbias of nature; there’s father against child. We have seen the\r\nbest of our time. Machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all\r\nruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves. Find out\r\nthis villain, Edmund; it shall lose thee nothing; do it\r\ncarefully.—And the noble and true-hearted Kent banished! his\r\noffence, honesty! ’Tis strange.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nThis is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we are\r\nsick in fortune, often the surfeits of our own behaviour, we\r\nmake guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars; as\r\nif we were villains on necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion;\r\nknaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical predominance;\r\ndrunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforced obedience of\r\nplanetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by a divine\r\nthrusting on. An admirable evasion of whoremaster man, to lay his\r\ngoatish disposition to the charge of a star. My father compounded\r\nwith my mother under the dragon’s tail, and my nativity was under\r\nUrsa Major, so that it follows I am rough and lecherous. Fut! I\r\nshould have been that I am, had the maidenliest star in the\r\nfirmament twinkled on my bastardizing.\r\n\r\n Enter Edgar.\r\n\r\nPat! he comes, like the catastrophe of the old comedy: my cue\r\nis villainous melancholy, with a sigh like Tom o’Bedlam.—O,\r\nthese eclipses do portend these divisions! Fa, sol, la, mi.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nHow now, brother Edmund, what serious contemplation are you in?\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nI am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read this other day,\r\nwhat should follow these eclipses.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nDo you busy yourself with that?\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nI promise you, the effects he writes of succeed unhappily: as of\r\nunnaturalness between the child and the parent; death, dearth,\r\ndissolutions of ancient amities; divisions in state, menaces and\r\nmaledictions against King and nobles; needless diffidences,\r\nbanishment of friends, dissipation of cohorts, nuptial breaches,\r\nand I know not what.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nHow long have you been a sectary astronomical?\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nCome, come! when saw you my father last?\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nThe night gone by.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nSpake you with him?\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nAy, two hours together.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nParted you in good terms? Found you no displeasure in him, by word\r\nnor countenance?\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nNone at all.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nBethink yourself wherein you may have offended him: and at my\r\nentreaty forbear his presence until some little time hath\r\nqualified the heat of his displeasure; which at this instant so\r\nrageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would\r\nscarcely allay.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nSome villain hath done me wrong.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nThat’s my fear. I pray you have a continent forbearance till the\r\nspeed of his rage goes slower; and, as I say, retire with me to\r\nmy lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my lord\r\nspeak: pray ye, go; there’s my key. If you do stir abroad, go\r\narmed.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nArmed, brother?\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nBrother, I advise you to the best; I am no honest man\r\nif there be any good meaning toward you: I have told you what I\r\nhave seen and heard. But faintly; nothing like the image and\r\nhorror of it: pray you, away!\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nShall I hear from you anon?\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nI do serve you in this business.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Edgar._]\r\n\r\nA credulous father! and a brother noble,\r\nWhose nature is so far from doing harms\r\nThat he suspects none; on whose foolish honesty\r\nMy practices ride easy! I see the business.\r\nLet me, if not by birth, have lands by wit;\r\nAll with me’s meet that I can fashion fit.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III.

When he returns from hunting,\r\nI will not speak with him; say I am sick.\r\nIf you come slack of former services,\r\nYou shall do well; the fault of it I’ll answer.\r\n\r\n [_Horns within._]\r\n\r\nOSWALD.\r\nHe’s coming, madam; I hear him.\r\n\r\nGONERIL.\r\nPut on what weary negligence you please,\r\nYou and your fellows; I’d have it come to question:\r\nIf he distaste it, let him to our sister,\r\nWhose mind and mine, I know, in that are one,\r\nNot to be overruled. Idle old man,\r\nThat still would manage those authorities\r\nThat he hath given away! Now, by my life,\r\nOld fools are babes again; and must be us’d\r\nWith checks as flatteries, when they are seen abus’d.\r\nRemember what I have said.\r\n\r\nOSWALD.\r\nVery well, madam.\r\n\r\nGONERIL.\r\nAnd let his knights have colder looks among you;\r\nWhat grows of it, no matter; advise your fellows so;\r\nI would breed from hence occasions, and I shall,\r\nThat I may speak. I’ll write straight to my sister\r\nTo hold my very course. Prepare for dinner.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV.

That which\r\nordinary men are fit for, I am qualified in, and the best of\r\nme is diligence.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nHow old art thou?\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nNot so young, sir, to love a woman for singing; nor so old to\r\ndote on her for anything: I have years on my back forty-eight.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nFollow me; thou shalt serve me. If I like thee no worse after dinner, I\r\nwill not part from thee yet. Dinner, ho, dinner! Where’s my knave? my\r\nfool?

What is his fault?\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nHis countenance likes me not.\r\n\r\nCORNWALL.\r\nNo more perchance does mine, or his, or hers.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nSir, ’tis my occupation to be plain:\r\nI have seen better faces in my time\r\nThan stands on any shoulder that I see\r\nBefore me at this instant.\r\n\r\nCORNWALL.\r\nThis is some fellow\r\nWho, having been prais’d for bluntness, doth affect\r\nA saucy roughness, and constrains the garb\r\nQuite from his nature: he cannot flatter, he,\r\nAn honest mind and plain, he must speak truth!\r\nAn they will take it, so; if not, he’s plain.\r\nThese kind of knaves I know which in this plainness\r\nHarbour more craft and more corrupter ends\r\nThan twenty silly-ducking observants\r\nThat stretch their duties nicely.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nSir, in good faith, in sincere verity,\r\nUnder th’allowance of your great aspect,\r\nWhose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire\r\nOn flickering Phoebus’ front,—\r\n\r\nCORNWALL.\r\nWhat mean’st by this?\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nTo go out of my dialect, which you discommend so much. I know,\r\nsir, I am no flatterer: he that beguiled you in a plain accent\r\nwas a plain knave; which, for my part, I will not be, though I\r\nshould win your displeasure to entreat me to’t.\r\n\r\nCORNWALL.\r\nWhat was the offence you gave him?\r\n\r\nOSWALD.\r\nI never gave him any:\r\nIt pleas’d the King his master very late\r\nTo strike at me, upon his misconstruction;\r\nWhen he, compact, and flattering his displeasure,\r\nTripp’d me behind; being down, insulted, rail’d\r\nAnd put upon him such a deal of man,\r\nThat worthied him, got praises of the King\r\nFor him attempting who was self-subdu’d;\r\nAnd, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,\r\nDrew on me here again.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nNone of these rogues and cowards\r\nBut Ajax is their fool.\r\n\r\nCORNWALL.\r\nFetch forth the stocks!\r\nYou stubborn ancient knave, you reverent braggart,\r\nWe’ll teach you.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nSir, I am too old to learn:\r\nCall not your stocks for me: I serve the King;\r\nOn whose employment I was sent to you:\r\nYou shall do small respect, show too bold malice\r\nAgainst the grace and person of my master,\r\nStocking his messenger.\r\n\r\nCORNWALL.\r\nFetch forth the stocks!\r\nAs I have life and honour, there shall he sit till noon.\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\nTill noon! Till night, my lord; and all night too!\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nWhy, madam, if I were your father’s dog,\r\nYou should not use me so.\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\nSir, being his knave, I will.\r\n\r\n [_Stocks brought out._]\r\n\r\nCORNWALL.\r\nThis is a fellow of the selfsame colour\r\nOur sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks!\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nLet me beseech your grace not to do so:\r\nHis fault is much, and the good King his master\r\nWill check him for’t: your purpos’d low correction\r\nIs such as basest and contemned’st wretches\r\nFor pilferings and most common trespasses,\r\nAre punish’d with. The King must take it ill\r\nThat he, so slightly valued in his messenger,\r\nShould have him thus restrained.\r\n\r\nCORNWALL.\r\nI’ll answer that.\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\nMy sister may receive it much more worse,\r\nTo have her gentleman abus’d, assaulted,\r\nFor following her affairs.

Nothing almost sees miracles\r\nBut misery. I know ’tis from Cordelia,\r\nWho hath most fortunately been inform’d\r\nOf my obscured course. And shall find time\r\nFrom this enormous state, seeking to give\r\nLosses their remedies. All weary and o’erwatch’d,\r\nTake vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold\r\nThis shameful lodging.\r\nFortune, good night: smile once more, turn thy wheel!\r\n\r\n [_He sleeps._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. The open Country\r\n\r\n Enter Edgar.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nI heard myself proclaim’d,\r\nAnd by the happy hollow of a tree\r\nEscap’d the hunt. No port is free, no place\r\nThat guard and most unusual vigilance\r\nDoes not attend my taking. While I may scape\r\nI will preserve myself: and am bethought\r\nTo take the basest and most poorest shape\r\nThat ever penury in contempt of man,\r\nBrought near to beast: my face I’ll grime with filth,\r\nBlanket my loins; elf all my hair in knots,\r\nAnd with presented nakedness outface\r\nThe winds and persecutions of the sky.\r\nThe country gives me proof and precedent\r\nOf Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,\r\nStrike in their numb’d and mortified bare arms\r\nPins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;\r\nAnd with this horrible object, from low farms,\r\nPoor pelting villages, sheep-cotes, and mills,\r\nSometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,\r\nEnforce their charity. Poor Turlygod! poor Tom,\r\nThat’s something yet: Edgar I nothing am.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV.

Mak’st thou this shame thy pastime?\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nNo, my lord.\r\n\r\nFOOL.\r\nHa, ha! he wears cruel garters.

Let go thy hold when a great\r\nwheel runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with following\r\nit; but the great one that goes upward, let him draw thee after.\r\nWhen a wise man gives thee better counsel, give me mine again: I\r\nwould have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it.\r\n That sir which serves and seeks for gain,\r\n And follows but for form,\r\n Will pack when it begins to rain,\r\n And leave thee in the storm.\r\n But I will tarry; the fool will stay,\r\n And let the wise man fly:\r\n The knave turns fool that runs away;\r\n The fool no knave perdy.\r\n\nKENT.\r\nWhere learn’d you this, fool?\r\n\r\nFOOL.\r\nNot i’ the stocks, fool.\r\n\r\n Enter Lear and Gloucester.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nDeny to speak with me?

Dost thou understand me, man?\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nAy, my good lord.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nThe King would speak with Cornwall; the dear father\r\nWould with his daughter speak, commands, tends, service,\r\nAre they inform’d of this? My breath and blood!\r\nFiery? The fiery Duke, tell the hot Duke that—\r\nNo, but not yet: maybe he is not well:\r\nInfirmity doth still neglect all office\r\nWhereto our health is bound: we are not ourselves\r\nWhen nature, being oppress’d, commands the mind\r\nTo suffer with the body: I’ll forbear;\r\nAnd am fallen out with my more headier will,\r\nTo take the indispos’d and sickly fit\r\nFor the sound man.

Howe’er thou art a fiend,\r\nA woman’s shape doth shield thee.\r\n\r\nGONERIL.\r\nMarry, your manhood, mew!\r\n\r\n Enter a Messenger.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nWhat news?\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nO, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall’s dead;\r\nSlain by his servant, going to put out\r\nThe other eye of Gloucester.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nGloucester’s eyes!\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nA servant that he bred, thrill’d with remorse,\r\nOppos’d against the act, bending his sword\r\nTo his great master; who, thereat enrag’d,\r\nFlew on him, and amongst them fell’d him dead;\r\nBut not without that harmful stroke which since\r\nHath pluck’d him after.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nThis shows you are above,\r\nYou justicers, that these our nether crimes\r\nSo speedily can venge! But, O poor Gloucester!\r\nLost he his other eye?\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nBoth, both, my lord.\r\nThis letter, madam, craves a speedy answer;\r\n’Tis from your sister.\r\n\r\nGONERIL.\r\n[_Aside._] One way I like this well;\r\nBut being widow, and my Gloucester with her,\r\nMay all the building in my fancy pluck\r\nUpon my hateful life. Another way\r\nThe news is not so tart. I’ll read, and answer.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nWhere was his son when they did take his eyes?\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nCome with my lady hither.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nHe is not here.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nNo, my good lord; I met him back again.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nKnows he the wickedness?\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nAy, my good lord. ’Twas he inform’d against him;\r\nAnd quit the house on purpose, that their punishment\r\nMight have the freer course.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nGloucester, I live\r\nTo thank thee for the love thou show’dst the King,\r\nAnd to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend,\r\nTell me what more thou know’st.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. The French camp near Dover\r\n\r\n Enter Kent and a Gentleman.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nWhy the King of France is so suddenly gone back, know you no\r\nreason?\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nSomething he left imperfect in the state, which since his coming\r\nforth is thought of, which imports to the kingdom so much fear\r\nand danger that his personal return was most required and\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nWho hath he left behind him general?\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nThe Mareschal of France, Monsieur La Far.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nDid your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of grief?\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nAy, sir; she took them, read them in my presence;\r\nAnd now and then an ample tear trill’d down\r\nHer delicate cheek. It seem’d she was a queen\r\nOver her passion; who, most rebel-like,\r\nSought to be king o’er her.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nO, then it mov’d her.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nNot to a rage: patience and sorrow strove\r\nWho should express her goodliest. You have seen\r\nSunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears\r\nWere like a better day. Those happy smilets\r\nThat play’d on her ripe lip seem’d not to know\r\nWhat guests were in her eyes; which parted thence\r\nAs pearls from diamonds dropp’d. In brief,\r\nSorrow would be a rarity most belov’d,\r\nIf all could so become it.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nMade she no verbal question?\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nFaith, once or twice she heav’d the name of ‘father’\r\nPantingly forth, as if it press’d her heart;\r\nCried ‘Sisters, sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters!\r\nKent! father! sisters! What, i’ the storm? i’ the night?\r\nLet pity not be believ’d!’ There she shook\r\nThe holy water from her heavenly eyes,\r\nAnd clamour master’d her: then away she started\r\nTo deal with grief alone.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nIt is the stars,\r\nThe stars above us govern our conditions;\r\nElse one self mate and make could not beget\r\nSuch different issues. You spoke not with her since?\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nWas this before the King return’d?\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nNo, since.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nWell, sir, the poor distressed Lear’s i’ the town;\r\nWho sometime, in his better tune, remembers\r\nWhat we are come about, and by no means\r\nWill yield to see his daughter.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nWhy, good sir?\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nA sovereign shame so elbows him. His own unkindness,\r\nThat stripp’d her from his benediction, turn’d her\r\nTo foreign casualties, gave her dear rights\r\nTo his dog-hearted daughters, these things sting\r\nHis mind so venomously that burning shame\r\nDetains him from Cordelia.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nAlack, poor gentleman!\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nOf Albany’s and Cornwall’s powers you heard not?\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\n’Tis so; they are afoot.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nWell, sir, I’ll bring you to our master Lear\r\nAnd leave you to attend him. Some dear cause\r\nWill in concealment wrap me up awhile;\r\nWhen I am known aright, you shall not grieve\r\nLending me this acquaintance.\r\nI pray you, go along with me.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV. The French camp. A Tent\r\n\r\n Enter with drum and colours, Cordelia, Physician\r\nand Soldiers.\r\n\r\nCORDELIA.\r\nAlack, ’tis he: why, he was met even now\r\nAs mad as the vex’d sea; singing aloud;\r\nCrown’d with rank fumiter and furrow weeds,\r\nWith harlocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,\r\nDarnel, and all the idle weeds that grow\r\nIn our sustaining corn. A century send forth;\r\nSearch every acre in the high-grown field,\r\nAnd bring him to our eye.\r\n\r\n [_Exit an Officer._]\r\n\r\nWhat can man’s wisdom\r\nIn the restoring his bereaved sense,\r\nHe that helps him take all my outward worth.\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN.\r\nThere is means, madam:\r\nOur foster nurse of nature is repose,\r\nThe which he lacks; that to provoke in him\r\nAre many simples operative, whose power\r\nWill close the eye of anguish.\r\n\r\nCORDELIA.\r\nAll bless’d secrets,\r\nAll you unpublish’d virtues of the earth,\r\nSpring with my tears! Be aidant and remediate\r\nIn the good man’s distress! Seek, seek for him;\r\nLest his ungovern’d rage dissolve the life\r\nThat wants the means to lead it.\r\n\r\n Enter a Messenger.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nNews, madam;\r\nThe British powers are marching hitherward.\r\n\r\nCORDELIA.\r\n’Tis known before. Our preparation stands\r\nIn expectation of them. O dear father,\r\nIt is thy business that I go about;\r\nTherefore great France\r\nMy mourning and important tears hath pitied.\r\nNo blown ambition doth our arms incite,\r\nBut love, dear love, and our ag’d father’s right:\r\nSoon may I hear and see him!\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE V. A Room in Gloucester’s Castle\r\n\r\n Enter Regan and Oswald.\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\nBut are my brother’s powers set forth?\r\n\r\nOSWALD.\r\nAy, madam.\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\nHimself in person there?\r\n\r\nOSWALD.\r\nMadam, with much ado.\r\nYour sister is the better soldier.\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\nLord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?\r\n\r\nOSWALD.\r\nNo, madam.\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\nWhat might import my sister’s letter to him?\r\n\r\nOSWALD.\r\nI know not, lady.\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\nFaith, he is posted hence on serious matter.\r\nIt was great ignorance, Gloucester’s eyes being out,\r\nTo let him live. Where he arrives he moves\r\nAll hearts against us. Edmund, I think, is gone\r\nIn pity of his misery, to dispatch\r\nHis nighted life; moreover to descry\r\nThe strength o’ th’enemy.\r\n\r\nOSWALD.\r\nI must needs after him, madam, with my letter.\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\nOur troops set forth tomorrow; stay with us;\r\nThe ways are dangerous.\r\n\r\nOSWALD.\r\nI may not, madam:\r\nMy lady charg’d my duty in this business.\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\nWhy should she write to Edmund? Might not you\r\nTransport her purposes by word? Belike,\r\nSomethings, I know not what, I’ll love thee much.\r\nLet me unseal the letter.\r\n\r\nOSWALD.\r\nMadam, I had rather—\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\nI know your lady does not love her husband;\r\nI am sure of that; and at her late being here\r\nShe gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks\r\nTo noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.\r\n\r\nOSWALD.\r\nI, madam?\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\nI speak in understanding; y’are, I know’t:\r\nTherefore I do advise you take this note:\r\nMy lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk’d,\r\nAnd more convenient is he for my hand\r\nThan for your lady’s. You may gather more.\r\nIf you do find him, pray you give him this;\r\nAnd when your mistress hears thus much from you,\r\nI pray desire her call her wisdom to her.\r\nSo, fare you well.\r\nIf you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,\r\nPreferment falls on him that cuts him off.\r\n\r\nOSWALD.\r\nWould I could meet him, madam! I should show\r\nWhat party I do follow.\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\nFare thee well.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE VI. The country near Dover\r\n\r\n Enter Gloucester, and Edgar dressed like a peasant.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nWhen shall I come to the top of that same hill?\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nYou do climb up it now. Look how we labour.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nMethinks the ground is even.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nHorrible steep.\r\nHark, do you hear the sea?\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nNo, truly.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nWhy, then, your other senses grow imperfect\r\nBy your eyes’ anguish.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nSo may it be indeed.\r\nMethinks thy voice is alter’d; and thou speak’st\r\nIn better phrase and matter than thou didst.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nY’are much deceiv’d: in nothing am I chang’d\r\nBut in my garments.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nMethinks you’re better spoken.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nCome on, sir; here’s the place. Stand still. How fearful\r\nAnd dizzy ’tis to cast one’s eyes so low!\r\nThe crows and choughs that wing the midway air\r\nShow scarce so gross as beetles. Half way down\r\nHangs one that gathers samphire—dreadful trade!\r\nMethinks he seems no bigger than his head.\r\nThe fishermen that walk upon the beach\r\nAppear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,\r\nDiminish’d to her cock; her cock a buoy\r\nAlmost too small for sight: the murmuring surge\r\nThat on th’unnumber’d idle pebble chafes\r\nCannot be heard so high. I’ll look no more;\r\nLest my brain turn, and the deficient sight\r\nTopple down headlong.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nSet me where you stand.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nGive me your hand.\r\nYou are now within a foot of th’extreme verge.\r\nFor all beneath the moon would I not leap upright.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nLet go my hand.\r\nHere, friend, ’s another purse; in it a jewel\r\nWell worth a poor man’s taking. Fairies and gods\r\nProsper it with thee! Go thou further off;\r\nBid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nNow fare ye well, good sir.\r\n\r\n [_Seems to go._]\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nWith all my heart.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\n[_Aside._] Why I do trifle thus with his despair\r\nIs done to cure it.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nO you mighty gods!\r\nThis world I do renounce, and in your sights,\r\nShake patiently my great affliction off:\r\nIf I could bear it longer, and not fall\r\nTo quarrel with your great opposeless wills,\r\nMy snuff and loathed part of nature should\r\nBurn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!\r\nNow, fellow, fare thee well.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nGone, sir, farewell.\r\n\r\n [_Gloucester leaps, and falls along_]\r\n\r\nAnd yet I know not how conceit may rob\r\nThe treasury of life when life itself\r\nYields to the theft. Had he been where he thought,\r\nBy this had thought been past. Alive or dead?\r\nHo you, sir! friend! Hear you, sir? speak!\r\nThus might he pass indeed: yet he revives.\r\nWhat are you, sir?\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nAway, and let me die.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nHadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,\r\nSo many fathom down precipitating,\r\nThou’dst shiver’d like an egg: but thou dost breathe;\r\nHast heavy substance; bleed’st not; speak’st; art sound.\r\nTen masts at each make not the altitude\r\nWhich thou hast perpendicularly fell.\r\nThy life is a miracle. Speak yet again.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nBut have I fall’n, or no?\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nFrom the dread summit of this chalky bourn.\r\nLook up a-height, the shrill-gorg’d lark so far\r\nCannot be seen or heard. Do but look up.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nAlack, I have no eyes.\r\nIs wretchedness depriv’d that benefit\r\nTo end itself by death? ’Twas yet some comfort\r\nWhen misery could beguile the tyrant’s rage\r\nAnd frustrate his proud will.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nGive me your arm.\r\nUp, so. How is’t? Feel you your legs? You stand.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nToo well, too well.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nThis is above all strangeness.\r\nUpon the crown o’ the cliff what thing was that\r\nWhich parted from you?\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nA poor unfortunate beggar.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nAs I stood here below, methought his eyes\r\nWere two full moons; he had a thousand noses,\r\nHorns whelk’d and waved like the enraged sea.\r\nIt was some fiend. Therefore, thou happy father,\r\nThink that the clearest gods, who make them honours\r\nOf men’s impossibilities, have preserv’d thee.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nI do remember now: henceforth I’ll bear\r\nAffliction till it do cry out itself\r\n‘Enough, enough,’ and die. That thing you speak of,\r\nI took it for a man; often ’twould say,\r\n‘The fiend, the fiend’; he led me to that place.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nBear free and patient thoughts. But who comes here?\r\n\r\n Enter Lear, fantastically\r\ndressed up with flowers.\r\n\r\nThe safer sense will ne’er accommodate\r\nHis master thus.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nNo, they cannot touch me for coining. I am the King himself.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nO thou side-piercing sight!\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nNature’s above art in that respect. There’s your press money.\r\nThat fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper: draw me a clothier’s\r\nyard. Look, look, a mouse! Peace, peace, this piece of toasted cheese\r\nwill do’t. There’s my gauntlet; I’ll prove it on a giant.\r\nBring up the brown bills. O, well flown, bird! i’ the clout, i’\r\nthe clout. Hewgh! Give the word.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nSweet marjoram.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nPass.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nI know that voice.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nHa! Goneril with a white beard! They flattered me like a dog; and told\r\nme I had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones were there. To say\r\n‘ay’ and ‘no’ to everything I said ‘ay’\r\nand ‘no’ to was no good divinity. When the rain came to wet\r\nme once, and the wind to make me chatter; when the thunder would not\r\npeace at my bidding; there I found ’em, there I smelt ’em out.\r\nGo to, they are not men o’ their words: they told me I was everything;\r\n’tis a lie, I am not ague-proof.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nThe trick of that voice I do well remember:\r\nIs’t not the King?\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nAy, every inch a king.\r\nWhen I do stare, see how the subject quakes.\r\nI pardon that man’s life. What was thy cause?\r\nAdultery? Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:\r\nThe wren goes to’t, and the small gilded fly\r\nDoes lecher in my sight. Let copulation thrive;\r\nFor Gloucester’s bastard son was kinder to his father\r\nThan my daughters got ’tween the lawful sheets.\r\nTo’t, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.\r\nBehold yond simp’ring dame,\r\nWhose face between her forks presages snow;\r\nThat minces virtue, and does shake the head\r\nTo hear of pleasure’s name.\r\nThe fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to’t with a more riotous\r\nappetite. Down from the waist they are centaurs, though women all\r\nabove. But to the girdle do the gods inherit, beneath is all the\r\nfiend’s; there’s hell, there’s darkness, there is the sulphurous pit;\r\nburning, scalding, stench,\r\nconsumption. Fie, fie, fie! pah, pah! Give me an ounce of civet, good\r\napothecary, to sweeten my imagination. There’s money for thee.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nO, let me kiss that hand!\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nLet me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nO ruin’d piece of nature, this great world\r\nShall so wear out to naught. Dost thou know me?\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nI remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny at me?\r\nNo, do thy worst, blind Cupid; I’ll not love.\r\nRead thou this challenge; mark but the penning of it.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nWere all the letters suns, I could not see one.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nI would not take this from report,\r\nIt is, and my heart breaks at it.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nRead.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nWhat, with the case of eyes?\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nO, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your head, nor no money\r\nin your purse? Your eyes are in a heavy case, your purse in a\r\nlight, yet you see how this world goes.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nI see it feelingly.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nWhat, art mad? A man may see how the world goes with no eyes.\r\nLook with thine ears. See how yon justice rails upon yon simple\r\nthief. Hark, in thine ear: change places; and, handy-dandy, which\r\nis the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen a farmer’s\r\ndog bark at a beggar?\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nAy, sir.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nAnd the creature run from the cur? There thou mightst behold\r\nthe great image of authority: a dog’s obeyed in office.\r\nThou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!\r\nWhy dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;\r\nThou hotly lusts to use her in that kind\r\nFor which thou whipp’st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.\r\nThrough tatter’d clothes great vices do appear;\r\nRobes and furr’d gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,\r\nAnd the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks;\r\nArm it in rags, a pygmy’s straw does pierce it.\r\nNone does offend, none, I say none; I’ll able ’em;\r\nTake that of me, my friend, who have the power\r\nTo seal the accuser’s lips. Get thee glass eyes,\r\nAnd like a scurvy politician, seem\r\nTo see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now:\r\nPull off my boots: harder, harder, so.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nO, matter and impertinency mix’d!\r\nReason in madness!\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nIf thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.\r\nI know thee well enough, thy name is Gloucester.\r\nThou must be patient; we came crying hither:\r\nThou know’st the first time that we smell the air\r\nWe wawl and cry. I will preach to thee: mark.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nAlack, alack the day!\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nWhen we are born, we cry that we are come\r\nTo this great stage of fools. This a good block:\r\nIt were a delicate stratagem to shoe\r\nA troop of horse with felt. I’ll put’t in proof\r\nAnd when I have stol’n upon these son-in-laws,\r\nThen kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!\r\n\r\n Enter a Gentleman with\r\nAttendants.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nO, here he is: lay hand upon him. Sir,\r\nYour most dear daughter—\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nNo rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even\r\nThe natural fool of fortune. Use me well;\r\nYou shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons;\r\nI am cut to the brains.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nYou shall have anything.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nNo seconds? All myself?\r\nWhy, this would make a man a man of salt,\r\nTo use his eyes for garden water-pots,\r\nAy, and for laying autumn’s dust.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nGood sir.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nI will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom.\r\nWhat! I will be jovial. Come, come,\r\nI am a king, my masters, know you that.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nYou are a royal one, and we obey you.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nThen there’s life in’t. Come, and you get it,\r\nYou shall get it by running. Sa, sa, sa, sa!\r\n\r\n [_Exit running. Attendants follow._]\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nA sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,\r\nPast speaking of in a king! Thou hast one daughter\r\nWho redeems nature from the general curse\r\nWhich twain have brought her to.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nHail, gentle sir.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nSir, speed you. What’s your will?\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nDo you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nMost sure and vulgar.\r\nEveryone hears that, which can distinguish sound.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nBut, by your favour,\r\nHow near’s the other army?\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nNear and on speedy foot; the main descry\r\nStands on the hourly thought.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nI thank you sir, that’s all.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nThough that the queen on special cause is here,\r\nHer army is mov’d on.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nI thank you, sir.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Gentleman._]\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nYou ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me;\r\nLet not my worser spirit tempt me again\r\nTo die before you please.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nWell pray you, father.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nNow, good sir, what are you?\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nA most poor man, made tame to fortune’s blows;\r\nWho, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,\r\nAm pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand,\r\nI’ll lead you to some biding.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nHearty thanks:\r\nThe bounty and the benison of heaven\r\nTo boot, and boot.\r\n\r\n Enter Oswald.\r\n\r\nOSWALD.\r\nA proclaim’d prize! Most happy!\r\nThat eyeless head of thine was first fram’d flesh\r\nTo raise my fortunes. Thou old unhappy traitor,\r\nBriefly thyself remember. The sword is out\r\nThat must destroy thee.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nNow let thy friendly hand\r\nPut strength enough to’t.\r\n\r\n [_Edgar interposes._]\r\n\r\nOSWALD.\r\nWherefore, bold peasant,\r\nDar’st thou support a publish’d traitor? Hence;\r\nLest that th’infection of his fortune take\r\nLike hold on thee. Let go his arm.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nChill not let go, zir, without vurther ’casion.\r\n\r\nOSWALD.\r\nLet go, slave, or thou diest!\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nGood gentleman, go your gait, and let poor volke pass. An chud ha’\r\nbin zwaggered out of my life, ’twould not ha’ bin zo long\r\nas ’tis by a vortnight. Nay, come not near th’old man; keep\r\nout, che vor ye, or ise try whether your costard or my ballow be the\r\nharder: chill be plain with you.\r\n\r\nOSWALD.\r\nOut, dunghill!\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nChill pick your teeth, zir. Come! No matter vor your foins.\r\n\r\n [_They fight, and Edgar knocks him down._]\r\n\r\nOSWALD.\r\nSlave, thou hast slain me.

List a brief tale;\r\nAnd when ’tis told, O that my heart would burst!\r\nThe bloody proclamation to escape\r\nThat follow’d me so near,—O, our lives’ sweetness!\r\nThat with the pain of death we’d hourly die\r\nRather than die at once!—taught me to shift\r\nInto a madman’s rags; t’assume a semblance\r\nThat very dogs disdain’d; and in this habit\r\nMet I my father with his bleeding rings,\r\nTheir precious stones new lost; became his guide,\r\nLed him, begg’d for him, sav’d him from despair;\r\nNever,—O fault!—reveal’d myself unto him\r\nUntil some half hour past, when I was arm’d;\r\nNot sure, though hoping of this good success,\r\nI ask’d his blessing, and from first to last\r\nTold him my pilgrimage. But his flaw’d heart,\r\nAlack, too weak the conflict to support!\r\n’Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,\r\nBurst smilingly.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nThis speech of yours hath mov’d me,\r\nAnd shall perchance do good, but speak you on;\r\nYou look as you had something more to say.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nIf there be more, more woeful, hold it in;\r\nFor I am almost ready to dissolve,\r\nHearing of this.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nThis would have seem’d a period\r\nTo such as love not sorrow; but another,\r\nTo amplify too much, would make much more,\r\nAnd top extremity.\r\nWhilst I was big in clamour, came there a man\r\nWho, having seen me in my worst estate,\r\nShunn’d my abhorr’d society; but then finding\r\nWho ’twas that so endur’d, with his strong arms\r\nHe fastened on my neck, and bellow’d out\r\nAs he’d burst heaven; threw him on my father;\r\nTold the most piteous tale of Lear and him\r\nThat ever ear receiv’d, which in recounting\r\nHis grief grew puissant, and the strings of life\r\nBegan to crack. Twice then the trumpets sounded,\r\nAnd there I left him tranc’d.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nBut who was this?\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nKent, sir, the banish’d Kent; who in disguise\r\nFollow’d his enemy king and did him service\r\nImproper for a slave.\r\n\r\n Enter a Gentleman hastily,\r\nwith a bloody knife.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nHelp, help! O, help!\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nWhat kind of help?\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nSpeak, man.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nWhat means this bloody knife?\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\n’Tis hot, it smokes;\r\nIt came even from the heart of—O! she’s dead!\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nWho dead? Speak, man.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nYour lady, sir, your lady; and her sister\r\nBy her is poisoned; she hath confesses it.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nI was contracted to them both, all three\r\nNow marry in an instant.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nHere comes Kent.\r\n\r\n Enter Kent.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nProduce their bodies, be they alive or dead.\r\nThis judgement of the heavens that makes us tremble\r\nTouches us not with pity. O, is this he?\r\nThe time will not allow the compliment\r\nWhich very manners urges.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nI am come\r\nTo bid my King and master aye good night:\r\nIs he not here?\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nGreat thing of us forgot!\r\nSpeak, Edmund, where’s the King? and where’s Cordelia?\r\n\r\n The bodies of Goneril and\r\nRegan are brought in.\r\n\r\nSeest thou this object, Kent?\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nAlack, why thus?\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nYet Edmund was belov’d.\r\nThe one the other poisoned for my sake,\r\nAnd after slew herself.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nEven so. Cover their faces.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nI pant for life. Some good I mean to do,\r\nDespite of mine own nature. Quickly send,\r\nBe brief in it, to the castle; for my writ\r\nIs on the life of Lear and on Cordelia;\r\nNay, send in time.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nRun, run, O, run!\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nTo who, my lord? Who has the office? Send\r\nThy token of reprieve.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nWell thought on: take my sword,\r\nGive it the captain.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nHaste thee for thy life.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Edgar._]\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nHe hath commission from thy wife and me\r\nTo hang Cordelia in the prison, and\r\nTo lay the blame upon her own despair,\r\nThat she fordid herself.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nThe gods defend her!

He’s dead and rotten.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nNo, my good lord; I am the very man.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nI’ll see that straight.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nThat from your first of difference and decay\r\nHave follow’d your sad steps.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nYou are welcome hither.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nNor no man else.

The King of Navarre’s park\r\n\nEnter Ferdinand, King of Navarre, Berowne, Longaville and Dumaine.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nLet fame, that all hunt after in their lives,\r\nLive registered upon our brazen tombs,\r\nAnd then grace us in the disgrace of death;\r\nWhen, spite of cormorant devouring time,\r\nTh’ endeavour of this present breath may buy\r\nThat honour which shall bate his scythe’s keen edge,\r\nAnd make us heirs of all eternity.\r\nTherefore, brave conquerors, for so you are\r\nThat war against your own affections\r\nAnd the huge army of the world’s desires,\r\nOur late edict shall strongly stand in force.\r\nNavarre shall be the wonder of the world;\r\nOur court shall be a little academe,\r\nStill and contemplative in living art.\r\nYou three, Berowne, Dumaine and Longaville,\r\nHave sworn for three years’ term to live with me,\r\nMy fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes\r\nThat are recorded in this schedule here.\r\nYour oaths are passed, and now subscribe your names,\r\nThat his own hand may strike his honour down\r\nThat violates the smallest branch herein.\r\nIf you are armed to do as sworn to do,\r\nSubscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.\r\n\r\nLONGAVILLE.\r\nI am resolved. ’Tis but a three years’ fast.\r\nThe mind shall banquet, though the body pine.\r\nFat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bits\r\nMake rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.\r\n\r\n[_He signs._]\r\n\r\nDUMAINE.\r\nMy loving lord, Dumaine is mortified.\r\nThe grosser manner of these world’s delights\r\nHe throws upon the gross world’s baser slaves.\r\nTo love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die,\r\nWith all these living in philosophy.\r\n\r\n[_He signs._]\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nI can but say their protestation over.\r\nSo much, dear liege, I have already sworn,\r\nThat is, to live and study here three years.\r\nBut there are other strict observances:\r\nAs not to see a woman in that term,\r\nWhich I hope well is not enrolled there;\r\nAnd one day in a week to touch no food,\r\nAnd but one meal on every day beside,\r\nThe which I hope is not enrolled there;\r\nAnd then to sleep but three hours in the night,\r\nAnd not be seen to wink of all the day,\r\nWhen I was wont to think no harm all night,\r\nAnd make a dark night too of half the day,\r\nWhich I hope well is not enrolled there.\r\nO, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,\r\nNot to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nYour oath is passed to pass away from these.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nLet me say no, my liege, an if you please.\r\nI only swore to study with your Grace\r\nAnd stay here in your court for three years’ space.\r\n\r\nLONGAVILLE.\r\nYou swore to that, Berowne, and to the rest.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nBy yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.\r\nWhat is the end of study, let me know?\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nWhy, that to know which else we should not know.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nThings hid and barred, you mean, from common sense?\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nAy, that is study’s god-like recompense.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nCome on, then, I will swear to study so,\r\nTo know the thing I am forbid to know:\r\nAs thus, to study where I well may dine,\r\n When I to feast expressly am forbid;\r\nOr study where to meet some mistress fine,\r\n When mistresses from common sense are hid;\r\nOr, having sworn too hard-a-keeping oath,\r\nStudy to break it, and not break my troth.\r\nIf study’s gain be thus, and this be so,\r\nStudy knows that which yet it doth not know.\r\nSwear me to this, and I will ne’er say no.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nThese be the stops that hinder study quite,\r\nAnd train our intellects to vain delight.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nWhy, all delights are vain, but that most vain\r\nWhich, with pain purchased, doth inherit pain:\r\nAs painfully to pore upon a book\r\n To seek the light of truth, while truth the while\r\nDoth falsely blind the eyesight of his look.\r\n Light seeking light doth light of light beguile;\r\nSo, ere you find where light in darkness lies,\r\nYour light grows dark by losing of your eyes.\r\nStudy me how to please the eye indeed\r\n By fixing it upon a fairer eye,\r\nWho dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed,\r\n And give him light that it was blinded by.\r\nStudy is like the heaven’s glorious sun,\r\n That will not be deep-searched with saucy looks;\r\nSmall have continual plodders ever won,\r\n Save base authority from others’ books.\r\nThese earthly godfathers of heaven’s lights,\r\n That give a name to every fixed star,\r\nHave no more profit of their shining nights\r\n Than those that walk and wot not what they are.\r\nToo much to know is to know naught but fame,\r\nAnd every godfather can give a name.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nHow well he’s read, to reason against reading.\r\n\r\nDUMAINE.\r\nProceeded well, to stop all good proceeding.\r\n\r\nLONGAVILLE.\r\nHe weeds the corn, and still lets grow the weeding.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nThe spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.\r\n\r\nDUMAINE.\r\nHow follows that?\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nFit in his place and time.\r\n\r\nDUMAINE.\r\nIn reason nothing.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nSomething then in rhyme.\r\n\r\nLONGAVILLE.\r\nBerowne is like an envious sneaping frost\r\nThat bites the first-born infants of the spring.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nWell, say I am. Why should proud summer boast\r\nBefore the birds have any cause to sing?\r\nWhy should I joy in any abortive birth?\r\nAt Christmas I no more desire a rose\r\nThan wish a snow in May’s new-fangled shows,\r\nBut like of each thing that in season grows.\r\nSo you, to study now it is too late,\r\nClimb o’er the house to unlock the little gate.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nWell, sit you out. Go home, Berowne. Adieu.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nNo, my good lord, I have sworn to stay with you,\r\nAnd though I have for barbarism spoke more\r\n Than for that angel knowledge you can say,\r\nYet confident I’ll keep what I have sworn\r\n And bide the penance of each three years’ day.\r\nGive me the paper, let me read the same,\r\nAnd to the strictest decrees I’ll write my name.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nHow well this yielding rescues thee from shame.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\n[_Reads_.] _Item, That no woman shall come within a mile of my court._\r\nHath this been proclaimed?\r\n\r\nLONGAVILLE.\r\nFour days ago.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nLet’s see the penalty. [_Reads_.] _On pain of losing her tongue._ Who\r\ndevised this penalty?\r\n\r\nLONGAVILLE.\r\nMarry, that did I.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nSweet lord, and why?\r\n\r\nLONGAVILLE.\r\nTo fright them hence with that dread penalty.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nA dangerous law against gentility.\r\n[_Reads_.] _Item, If any man be seen to talk with a woman within the\r\nterm of three years, he shall endure such public shame as the rest of\r\nthe court can possibly devise._\r\nThis article, my liege, yourself must break,\r\n For well you know here comes in embassy\r\nThe French King’s daughter, with yourself to speak—\r\n A mild of grace and complete majesty—\r\nAbout surrender up of Aquitaine\r\n To her decrepit, sick, and bedrid father.\r\nTherefore this article is made in vain,\r\n Or vainly comes th’ admired Princess hither.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nWhat say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nSo study evermore is overshot.\r\nWhile it doth study to have what it would,\r\nIt doth forget to do the thing it should;\r\nAnd when it hath the thing it hunteth most,\r\n’Tis won as towns with fire: so won, so lost.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nWe must of force dispense with this decree.\r\nShe must lie here on mere necessity.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nNecessity will make us all forsworn\r\nThree thousand times within this three years’ space;\r\nFor every man with his affects is born,\r\nNot by might mastered, but by special grace.\r\nIf I break faith, this word shall speak for me:\r\nI am forsworn on mere necessity.\r\nSo to the laws at large I write my name,\r\nAnd he that breaks them in the least degree\r\nStands in attainder of eternal shame.\r\nSuggestions are to other as to me;\r\nBut I believe, although I seem so loath,\r\nI am the last that will last keep his oath.\r\n\r\n[_He signs._]\r\n\r\nBut is there no quick recreation granted?\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nAy, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted\r\nWith a refined traveller of Spain,\r\nA man in all the world’s new fashion planted,\r\nThat hath a mint of phrases in his brain;\r\nOne who the music of his own vain tongue\r\nDoth ravish like enchanting harmony,\r\nA man of complements, whom right and wrong\r\nHave chose as umpire of their mutiny.\r\nThis child of fancy, that Armado hight,\r\nFor interim to our studies shall relate\r\nIn high-born words the worth of many a knight\r\nFrom tawny Spain lost in the world’s debate.\r\nHow you delight, my lords, I know not, I,\r\nBut I protest I love to hear him lie,\r\nAnd I will use him for my minstrelsy.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nArmado is a most illustrious wight,\r\nA man of fire-new words, fashion’s own knight.\r\n\r\nLONGAVILLE.\r\nCostard the swain and he shall be our sport,\r\nAnd so to study three years is but short.\r\n\r\nEnter Dull, a Constable, with a letter, and Costard.\r\n\r\nDULL.\r\nWhich is the Duke’s own person?\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nThis, fellow. What wouldst?\r\n\r\nDULL.\r\nI myself reprehend his own person, for I am his Grace’s farborough. But\r\nI would see his own person in flesh and blood.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nThis is he.\r\n\r\nDULL.\r\nSignior Arm… Arm… commends you. There’s villainy abroad. This letter\r\nwill tell you more.\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nSir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nA letter from the magnificent Armado.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nHow long soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.\r\n\r\nLONGAVILLE.\r\nA high hope for a low heaven. God grant us patience!\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nTo hear, or forbear laughing?\r\n\r\nLONGAVILLE.\r\nTo hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately, or to forbear both.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nWell, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause to climb in the\r\nmerriness.\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nThe matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta. The manner of it\r\nis, I was taken with the manner.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nIn what manner?\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nIn manner and form following, sir, all those three. I was seen with her\r\nin the manor-house, sitting with her upon the form, and taken following\r\nher into the park, which, put together, is “in manner and form\r\nfollowing”. Now, sir, for the manner. It is the manner of a man to\r\nspeak to a woman. For the form—in some form.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nFor the “following”, sir?\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nAs it shall follow in my correction, and God defend the right!\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nWill you hear this letter with attention?\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nAs we would hear an oracle.\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nSuch is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\n[_Reads_.] _Great deputy, the welkin’s vicegerent and sole dominator of\r\nNavarre, my soul’s earth’s god and body’s fostering patron—_\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nNot a word of Costard yet.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\n[_Reads_.] _So it is—_\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nIt may be so; but if he say it is so, he is, in telling true, but so.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nPeace!\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nBe to me, and every man that dares not fight.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nNo words!\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nOf other men’s secrets, I beseech you.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\n[_Reads_.] _So it is, besieged with sable-coloured melancholy, I did\r\ncommend the black-oppressing humour to the most wholesome physic of thy\r\nhealth-giving air; and, as I am a gentleman, betook myself to walk.

But, sirrah, what say you to this?\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nSir, I confess the wench.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nDid you hear the proclamation?\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nI do confess much of the hearing it, but little of the marking of it.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nIt was proclaimed a year’s imprisonment to be taken with a wench.\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nI was taken with none, sir. I was taken with a damsel.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nWell, it was proclaimed “damsel”.\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nThis was no damsel neither, sir; she was a virgin.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nIt is so varied too, for it was proclaimed “virgin”.\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nIf it were, I deny her virginity. I was taken with a maid.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nThis maid will not serve your turn, sir.\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nThis maid will serve my turn, sir.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nSir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall fast a week with bran\r\nand water.\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nI had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nAnd Don Armado shall be your keeper.\r\nMy Lord Berowne, see him delivered o’er;\r\nAnd go we, lords, to put in practice that\r\nWhich each to other hath so strongly sworn.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt King, Longaville and Dumaine._]\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nI’ll lay my head to any good man’s hat\r\nThese oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.\r\nSirrah, come on.\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nI suffer for the truth, sir; for true it is I was taken with\r\nJaquenetta, and Jaquenetta is a true girl. And therefore welcome the\r\nsour cup of prosperity! Affliction may one day smile again, and till\r\nthen, sit thee down, sorrow.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. The park\r\n\r\nEnter Armado and Moth, his Page.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nBoy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit grows melancholy?\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nA great sign, sir, that he will look sad.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nWhy, sadness is one and the selfsame thing, dear imp.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nNo, no, O Lord, sir, no.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nHow canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my tender juvenal?\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nBy a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough signior.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nWhy tough signior? Why tough signior?\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nWhy tender juvenal? Why tender juvenal?\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nI spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton appertaining to\r\nthy young days, which we may nominate tender.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nAnd I, tough signior, as an appertinent title to your old time, which\r\nwe may name tough.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nPretty and apt.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nHow mean you, sir? I pretty and my saying apt, or I apt, and my saying\r\npretty?\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nThou pretty, because little.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nLittle pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nAnd therefore apt, because quick.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nSpeak you this in my praise, master?\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nIn thy condign praise.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nI will praise an eel with the same praise.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nWhat, that an eel is ingenious?\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nThat an eel is quick.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nI do say thou art quick in answers. Thou heat’st my blood.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nI am answered, sir.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nI love not to be crossed.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\n[_Aside_.] He speaks the mere contrary; crosses love not him.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nI have promised to study three years with the Duke.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nYou may do it in an hour, sir.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nImpossible.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nHow many is one thrice told?\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nI am ill at reckoning. It fitteth the spirit of a tapster.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nYou are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nI confess both. They are both the varnish of a complete man.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nThen I am sure you know how much the gross sum of deuce-ace amounts to.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nIt doth amount to one more than two.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nWhich the base vulgar do call three.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nTrue.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nWhy, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now here’s three studied ere\r\nye’ll thrice wink. And how easy it is to put “years” to the word\r\n“three”, and study three years in two words, the dancing horse will\r\ntell you.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nA most fine figure!\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\n[_Aside_.] To prove you a cipher.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nI will hereupon confess I am in love; and as it is base for a soldier\r\nto love, so am I in love with a base wench. If drawing my sword against\r\nthe humour of affection would deliver me from the reprobate thought of\r\nit, I would take desire prisoner, and ransom him to any French courtier\r\nfor a new-devised curtsy. I think scorn to sigh; methinks I should\r\noutswear Cupid. Comfort me, boy. What great men have been in love?\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nHercules, master.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nMost sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name more; and, sweet my\r\nchild, let them be men of good repute and carriage.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nSamson, master. He was a man of good carriage, great carriage, for he\r\ncarried the town gates on his back like a porter, and he was in love.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nO well-knit Samson, strong-jointed Samson! I do excel thee in my rapier\r\nas much as thou didst me in carrying gates. I am in love too. Who was\r\nSamson’s love, my dear Moth?\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nA woman, master.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nOf what complexion?\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nOf all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the four.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nTell me precisely of what complexion.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nOf the sea-water green, sir.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nIs that one of the four complexions?\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nAs I have read, sir; and the best of them too.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nGreen indeed is the colour of lovers. But to have a love of that\r\ncolour, methinks Samson had small reason for it. He surely affected her\r\nfor her wit.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nIt was so, sir, for she had a green wit.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nMy love is most immaculate white and red.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nMost maculate thoughts, master, are masked under such colours.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nDefine, define, well-educated infant.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nMy father’s wit and my mother’s tongue assist me!\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nSweet invocation of a child, most pretty, and pathetical!\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\n If she be made of white and red,\r\n Her faults will ne’er be known;\r\n For blushing cheeks by faults are bred,\r\n And fears by pale white shown.\r\n Then if she fear, or be to blame,\r\n By this you shall not know,\r\n For still her cheeks possess the same\r\n Which native she doth owe.\r\nA dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of white and red.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nIs there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nThe world was very guilty of such a ballad some three ages since, but I\r\nthink now ’tis not to be found; or if it were, it would neither serve\r\nfor the writing nor the tune.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nI will have that subject newly writ o’er, that I may example my\r\ndigression by some mighty precedent. Boy, I do love that country girl\r\nthat I took in the park with the rational hind Costard. She deserves\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\n[_Aside_.] To be whipped: and yet a better love than my master.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nSing, boy. My spirit grows heavy in love.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nAnd that’s great marvel, loving a light wench.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nI say, sing.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nForbear till this company be past.\r\n\r\nEnter Costard the Clown, Dull the Constable and Jaquenetta a Wench.\r\n\r\nDULL.\r\nSir, the Duke’s pleasure is that you keep Costard safe; and you must\r\nsuffer him to take no delight, nor no penance, but he must fast three\r\ndays a week. For this damsel, I must keep her at the park. She is\r\nallowed for the dey-woman. Fare you well.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nI do betray myself with blushing.—Maid.\r\n\r\nJAQUENETTA.\r\nMan.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nI will visit thee at the lodge.\r\n\r\nJAQUENETTA.\r\nThat’s hereby.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nI know where it is situate.\r\n\r\nJAQUENETTA.\r\nLord, how wise you are!\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nI will tell thee wonders.\r\n\r\nJAQUENETTA.\r\nWith that face?\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nI love thee.\r\n\r\nJAQUENETTA.\r\nSo I heard you say.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nAnd so, farewell.\r\n\r\nJAQUENETTA.\r\nFair weather after you!\r\n\r\nDULL.\r\nCome, Jaquenetta, away.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Dull and Jaquenetta._]\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nVillain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou be pardoned.\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nWell, sir, I hope when I do it I shall do it on a full stomach.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nThou shalt be heavily punished.\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nI am more bound to you than your fellows, for they are but lightly\r\nrewarded.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nTake away this villain. Shut him up.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nCome, you transgressing slave, away!\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nLet me not be pent up, sir. I will fast being loose.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nNo, sir, that were fast and loose. Thou shalt to prison.\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nWell, if ever I do see the merry days of desolation that I have seen,\r\nsome shall see.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nWhat shall some see?\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nNay, nothing, Master Moth, but what they look upon. It is not for\r\nprisoners to be too silent in their words, and therefore I will say\r\nnothing. I thank God I have as little patience as another man, and\r\ntherefore I can be quiet.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Moth and Costard._]\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nI do affect the very ground, which is base, where her shoe, which is\r\nbaser, guided by her foot, which is basest, doth tread. I shall be\r\nforsworn, which is a great argument of falsehood, if I love. And how\r\ncan that be true love which is falsely attempted? Love is a familiar;\r\nLove is a devil. There is no evil angel but Love. Yet was Samson so\r\ntempted, and he had an excellent strength; yet was Solomon so seduced,\r\nand he had a very good wit. Cupid’s butt-shaft is too hard for\r\nHercules’ club, and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard’s rapier.\r\nThe first and second cause will not serve my turn; the _passado_ he\r\nrespects not, the _duello_ he regards not. His disgrace is to be called\r\nboy, but his glory is to subdue men. Adieu, valour; rust, rapier; be\r\nstill, drum, for your manager is in love. Yea, he loveth. Assist me,\r\nsome extemporal god of rhyme, for I am sure I shall turn sonnet.\r\nDevise, wit; write, pen; for I am for whole volumes in folio.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\nACT II\r\n\r\nSCENE I. The King of Navarre’s park. A pavilion and tents at a distance\r\n\nEnter the Princess of France, with three attending Ladies: Rosaline,\r\nMaria, Katharine and three Lords: Boyet, and two others.\r\n\r\nBOYET.\r\nNow, madam, summon up your dearest spirits.\r\nConsider who the King your father sends,\r\nTo whom he sends, and what’s his embassy.\r\nYourself, held precious in the world’s esteem,\r\nTo parley with the sole inheritor\r\nOf all perfections that a man may owe,\r\nMatchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight\r\nThan Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen.\r\nBe now as prodigal of all dear grace\r\nAs Nature was in making graces dear\r\nWhen she did starve the general world beside\r\nAnd prodigally gave them all to you.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nGood Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,\r\nNeeds not the painted flourish of your praise.\r\nBeauty is bought by judgement of the eye,\r\nNot uttered by base sale of chapmen’s tongues.\r\nI am less proud to hear you tell my worth\r\nThan you much willing to be counted wise\r\nIn spending your wit in the praise of mine.\r\nBut now to task the tasker: good Boyet,\r\nYou are not ignorant, all-telling fame\r\nDoth noise abroad Navarre hath made a vow,\r\nTill painful study shall outwear three years,\r\nNo woman may approach his silent court.\r\nTherefore to’s seemeth it a needful course,\r\nBefore we enter his forbidden gates,\r\nTo know his pleasure; and in that behalf,\r\nBold of your worthiness, we single you\r\nAs our best-moving fair solicitor.\r\nTell him the daughter of the King of France,\r\nOn serious business craving quick dispatch,\r\nImportunes personal conference with his Grace.\r\nHaste, signify so much, while we attend,\r\nLike humble-visaged suitors, his high will.\r\n\r\nBOYET.\r\nProud of employment, willingly I go.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nAll pride is willing pride, and yours is so.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Boyet._]\r\n\r\nWho are the votaries, my loving lords,\r\nThat are vow-fellows with this virtuous Duke?\r\n\r\nLORD.\r\nLord Longaville is one.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nKnow you the man?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nI know him, madam. At a marriage feast\r\nBetween Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir\r\nOf Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized\r\nIn Normandy, saw I this Longaville.\r\nA man of sovereign parts, he is esteemed,\r\nWell fitted in arts, glorious in arms.\r\nNothing becomes him ill that he would well.\r\nThe only soil of his fair virtue’s gloss,\r\nIf virtue’s gloss will stain with any soil,\r\nIs a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will,\r\nWhose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills\r\nIt should none spare that come within his power.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nSome merry mocking lord, belike. Is’t so?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nThey say so most that most his humours know.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nSuch short-lived wits do wither as they grow.\r\nWho are the rest?\r\n\r\nKATHARINE.\r\nThe young Dumaine, a well-accomplished youth,\r\nOf all that virtue love for virtue loved;\r\nMost power to do most harm, least knowing ill,\r\nFor he hath wit to make an ill shape good,\r\nAnd shape to win grace though he had no wit.\r\nI saw him at the Duke Alençon’s once;\r\nAnd much too little of that good I saw\r\nIs my report to his great worthiness.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nAnother of these students at that time\r\nWas there with him, if I have heard a truth.\r\nBerowne they call him, but a merrier man,\r\nWithin the limit of becoming mirth,\r\nI never spent an hour’s talk withal.\r\nHis eye begets occasion for his wit,\r\nFor every object that the one doth catch\r\nThe other turns to a mirth-moving jest,\r\nWhich his fair tongue, conceit’s expositor,\r\nDelivers in such apt and gracious words\r\nThat aged ears play truant at his tales,\r\nAnd younger hearings are quite ravished,\r\nSo sweet and voluble is his discourse.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nGod bless my ladies! Are they all in love,\r\nThat every one her own hath garnished\r\nWith such bedecking ornaments of praise?\r\n\r\nLORD.\r\nHere comes Boyet.\r\n\r\nEnter Boyet.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nNow, what admittance, lord?\r\n\r\nBOYET.\r\nNavarre had notice of your fair approach,\r\nAnd he and his competitors in oath\r\nWere all addressed to meet you, gentle lady,\r\nBefore I came. Marry, thus much I have learned:\r\nHe rather means to lodge you in the field,\r\nLike one that comes here to besiege his court,\r\nThan seek a dispensation for his oath,\r\nTo let you enter his unpeopled house.\r\n\r\nEnter King of Navarre, Longaville, Dumaine, Berowne and Attendants.\r\n\r\nHere comes Navarre.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nFair Princess, welcome to the court of Navarre.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\n“Fair” I give you back again, and “welcome” I have not yet. The roof of\r\nthis court is too high to be yours, and welcome to the wide fields too\r\nbase to be mine.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nYou shall be welcome, madam, to my court.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nI will be welcome then. Conduct me thither.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nHear me, dear lady. I have sworn an oath.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nOur Lady help my lord! He’ll be forsworn.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nNot for the world, fair madam, by my will.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nWhy, will shall break it; will, and nothing else.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nYour ladyship is ignorant what it is.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nWere my lord so, his ignorance were wise,\r\nWhere now his knowledge must prove ignorance.\r\nI hear your Grace hath sworn out housekeeping.\r\n’Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,\r\nAnd sin to break it.\r\nBut pardon me, I am too sudden bold.\r\nTo teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.\r\nVouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming,\r\nAnd suddenly resolve me in my suit.\r\n\r\n[_She gives him a paper._]\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nMadam, I will, if suddenly I may.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nYou will the sooner that I were away,\r\nFor you’ll prove perjured if you make me stay.\r\n\r\n[_The King reads the paper._]\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\n[_To Rosaline_.] Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nDid not I dance with you in Brabant once?\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nI know you did.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nHow needless was it then\r\nTo ask the question!\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nYou must not be so quick.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\n’Tis long of you that spur me with such questions.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nYour wit’s too hot, it speeds too fast, ’twill tire.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nNot till it leave the rider in the mire.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nWhat time o’ day?\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nThe hour that fools should ask.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nNow fair befall your mask.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nFair fall the face it covers.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nAnd send you many lovers!\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nAmen, so you be none.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nNay, then will I be gone.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nMadam, your father here doth intimate\r\nThe payment of a hundred thousand crowns,\r\nBeing but the one half of an entire sum\r\nDisbursed by my father in his wars.\r\nBut say that he or we, as neither have,\r\nReceived that sum, yet there remains unpaid\r\nA hundred thousand more, in surety of the which\r\nOne part of Aquitaine is bound to us,\r\nAlthough not valued to the money’s worth.\r\nIf then the King your father will restore\r\nBut that one half which is unsatisfied,\r\nWe will give up our right in Aquitaine,\r\nAnd hold fair friendship with his majesty.\r\nBut that, it seems, he little purposeth;\r\nFor here he doth demand to have repaid\r\nA hundred thousand crowns, and not demands,\r\nOn payment of a hundred thousand crowns,\r\nTo have his title live in Aquitaine,\r\nWhich we much rather had depart withal,\r\nAnd have the money by our father lent,\r\nThan Aquitaine, so gelded as it is.\r\nDear Princess, were not his requests so far\r\nFrom reason’s yielding, your fair self should make\r\nA yielding ’gainst some reason in my breast,\r\nAnd go well satisfied to France again.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nYou do the King my father too much wrong,\r\nAnd wrong the reputation of your name,\r\nIn so unseeming to confess receipt\r\nOf that which hath so faithfully been paid.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nI do protest I never heard of it;\r\nAnd, if you prove it, I’ll repay it back\r\nOr yield up Aquitaine.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nWe arrest your word.\r\nBoyet, you can produce acquittances\r\nFor such a sum from special officers\r\nOf Charles his father.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nSatisfy me so.\r\n\r\nBOYET.\r\nSo please your Grace, the packet is not come\r\nWhere that and other specialties are bound.\r\nTomorrow you shall have a sight of them.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nIt shall suffice me; at which interview\r\nAll liberal reason I will yield unto.\r\nMeantime receive such welcome at my hand\r\nAs honour, without breach of honour, may\r\nMake tender of to thy true worthiness.\r\nYou may not come, fair Princess, in my gates,\r\nBut here without you shall be so received\r\nAs you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart,\r\nThough so denied fair harbour in my house.\r\nYour own good thoughts excuse me, and farewell.\r\nTomorrow shall we visit you again.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nSweet health and fair desires consort your Grace.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nThy own wish wish I thee in every place.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt the King, Longaville and Dumaine._]\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nLady, I will commend you to mine own heart.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nPray you, do my commendations; I would be glad to see it.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nI would you heard it groan.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nIs the fool sick?\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nSick at the heart.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nAlack, let it blood.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nWould that do it good?\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nMy physic says “ay”.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nWill you prick’t with your eye?\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\n_Non point_, with my knife.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nNow, God save thy life.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nAnd yours from long living.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nI cannot stay thanksgiving.\r\n\r\n[_He exits._]\r\n\r\nEnter Dumaine.\r\n\r\nDUMAINE.\r\nSir, I pray you, a word.

Go, tenderness of years, take this key, give enlargement to\r\nthe swain, bring him festinately hither. I must employ him in a letter\r\nto my love.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nMaster, will you win your love with a French brawl?\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nHow meanest thou? Brawling in French?\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nNo, my complete master; but to jig off a tune at the tongue’s end,\r\ncanary to it with your feet, humour it with turning up your eyelids,\r\nsigh a note and sing a note, sometime through the throat, as if you\r\nswallowed love with singing love, sometime through the nose, as if you\r\nsnuffed up love by smelling love; with your hat penthouse-like o’er the\r\nshop of your eyes, with your arms crossed on your thin-belly doublet\r\nlike a rabbit on a spit; or your hands in your pocket like a man after\r\nthe old painting; and keep not too long in one tune, but a snip and\r\naway. These are compliments, these are humours; these betray nice\r\nwenches that would be betrayed without these; and make them men of\r\nnote—do you note me?—that most are affected to these.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nHow hast thou purchased this experience?\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nBy my penny of observation.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nBut O—but O—\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\n“The hobby-horse is forgot.”\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nCall’st thou my love “hobby-horse”?\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nNo, master. The hobby-horse is but a colt, and your love perhaps a\r\nhackney. But have you forgot your love?\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nAlmost I had.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nNegligent student! Learn her by heart.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nBy heart and in heart, boy.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nAnd out of heart, master. All those three I will prove.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nWhat wilt thou prove?\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nA man, if I live; and this, “by, in, and without,” upon the instant:\r\n“by” heart you love her, because your heart cannot come by her; “in”\r\nheart you love her, because your heart is in love with her; and “out”\r\nof heart you love her, being out of heart that you cannot enjoy her.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nI am all these three.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nAnd three times as much more, and yet nothing at all.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nFetch hither the swain. He must carry me a letter.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nA message well sympathized: a horse to be ambassador for an ass.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nHa, ha, what sayest thou?\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nMarry, sir, you must send the ass upon the horse, for he is very\r\nslow-gaited. But I go.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nThe way is but short. Away!\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nAs swift as lead, sir.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nThe meaning, pretty ingenious?\r\nIs not lead a metal heavy, dull, and slow?\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\n_Minime_, honest master; or rather, master, no.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nI say lead is slow.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nYou are too swift, sir, to say so.\r\nIs that lead slow which is fired from a gun?\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nSweet smoke of rhetoric!\r\nHe reputes me a cannon; and the bullet, that’s he.\r\nI shoot thee at the swain.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nThump then, and I flee.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nA most acute juvenal, voluble and free of grace!\r\nBy thy favour, sweet welkin, I must sigh in thy face.\r\nMost rude melancholy, valour gives thee place.\r\nMy herald is returned.\r\n\r\nEnter Moth and Costard.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nA wonder, master! Here’s a costard broken in a shin.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nSome enigma, some riddle. Come, thy _l’envoi_ begin.\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nNo egma, no riddle, no _l’envoi_, no salve in the mail, sir. O, sir,\r\nplantain, a plain plantain! No _l’envoi_, no _l’envoi_, no salve, sir,\r\nbut a plantain.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nBy virtue, thou enforcest laughter; thy silly thought, my spleen; the\r\nheaving of my lungs provokes me to ridiculous smiling. O, pardon me, my\r\nstars! Doth the inconsiderate take _salve_ for _l’envoi_, and the word\r\n_l’envoi_ for a _salve?_\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nDo the wise think them other? Is not _l’envoi_ a _salve?_\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nNo, page; it is an epilogue or discourse to make plain\r\nSome obscure precedence that hath tofore been sain.\r\nI will example it:\r\n The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee\r\n Were still at odds, being but three.\r\nThere’s the moral. Now the _l’envoi_.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nI will add the _l’envoi_. Say the moral again.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\n The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee\r\n Were still at odds, being but three.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\n Until the goose came out of door,\r\n And stayed the odds by adding four.\r\nNow will I begin your moral, and do you follow with my _l’envoi_.\r\n The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee\r\n Were still at odds, being but three.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\n Until the goose came out of door,\r\n Staying the odds by adding four.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nA good _l’envoi_, ending in the goose. Would you desire more?\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nThe boy hath sold him a bargain, a goose, that’s flat.\r\nSir, your pennyworth is good, an your goose be fat.\r\nTo sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and loose.\r\nLet me see: a fat _l’envoi_—ay, that’s a fat goose.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nCome hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nBy saying that a costard was broken in a shin.\r\nThen called you for the _l’envoi_.\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nTrue, and I for a plantain. Thus came your argument in. Then the boy’s\r\nfat _l’envoi_, the goose that you bought; and he ended the market.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nBut tell me, how was there a costard broken in a shin?\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nI will tell you sensibly.\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nThou hast no feeling of it, Moth. I will speak that _l’envoi_.\r\n I, Costard, running out, that was safely within,\r\n Fell over the threshold and broke my shin.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nWe will talk no more of this matter.\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nTill there be more matter in the shin.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nSirrah Costard, I will enfranchise thee.\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nO, marry me to one Frances! I smell some _l’envoi_, some goose, in\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nBy my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty, enfreedoming thy\r\nperson. Thou wert immured, restrained, captivated, bound.\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nTrue, true; and now you will be my purgation, and let me loose.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nI give thee thy liberty, set thee from durance, and, in lieu thereof,\r\nimpose on thee nothing but this: [_Giving him a letter_.] bear this\r\nsignificant to the country maid Jaquenetta.

O, that’s the\r\nLatin word for three farthings. Three farthings—_remuneration_. “What’s\r\nthe price of this inkle?” “One penny.” “No, I’ll give you a\r\nremuneration.” Why, it carries it! _Remuneration_. Why, it is a fairer\r\nname than French crown.

God be wi’ you.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nStay, slave. I must employ thee.\r\nAs thou wilt win my favour, good my knave,\r\nDo one thing for me that I shall entreat.\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nWhen would you have it done, sir?\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nThis afternoon.\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nWell, I will do it, sir. Fare you well.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nThou knowest not what it is.\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nI shall know, sir, when I have done it.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nWhy, villain, thou must know first.\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nI will come to your worship tomorrow morning.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nIt must be done this afternoon.

Good night, my good owl.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Boyet and Maria._]\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nBy my soul, a swain, a most simple clown!\r\nLord, Lord, how the ladies and I have put him down!\r\nO’ my troth, most sweet jests, most incony vulgar wit,\r\nWhen it comes so smoothly off, so obscenely, as it were, so fit.\r\nArmado, o’ the one side, O, a most dainty man!\r\nTo see him walk before a lady and to bear her fan!\r\nTo see him kiss his hand and how most sweetly he will swear!\r\nAnd his page o’ t’other side, that handful of wit!\r\nAh, heavens, it is a most pathetical nit.\r\n\r\n[_Shout within._]\r\n\r\nSola, sola!\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. The same\r\n\r\nEnter Dull, Holofernes, the Pedant and Nathaniel.\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL.\r\nVery reverend sport, truly, and done in the testimony of a good\r\nconscience.\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\nThe deer was, as you know, _sanguis_, in blood, ripe as the pomewater,\r\nwho now hangeth like a jewel in the ear of _caelo_, the sky, the\r\nwelkin, the heaven, and anon falleth like a crab on the face of\r\n_terra_, the soil, the land, the earth.\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL.\r\nTruly, Master Holofernes, the epithets are sweetly varied, like a\r\nscholar at the least. But, sir, I assure ye it was a buck of the first\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\nSir Nathaniel, _haud credo_.\r\n\r\nDULL.\r\n’Twas not a “auld grey doe”, ’twas a pricket.\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\nMost barbarous intimation! Yet a kind of insinuation, as it were, _in\r\nvia_, in way, of explication; _facere_, as it were, replication, or\r\nrather, _ostentare_, to show, as it were, his inclination, after his\r\nundressed, unpolished, uneducated, unpruned, untrained, or rather,\r\nunlettered, or ratherest, unconfirmed fashion, to insert again my _haud\r\ncredo_ for a deer.\r\n\r\nDULL.\r\nI said the deer was not a “auld grey doe”, ’twas a pricket.\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\nTwice-sod simplicity, _bis coctus!_\r\nO, thou monster Ignorance, how deformed dost thou look!\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL.\r\nSir, he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred of a book.\r\nHe hath not eat paper, as it were; he hath not drunk ink.\r\nHis intellect is not replenished; he is only an animal, only sensible\r\nin the duller parts.\r\nAnd such barren plants are set before us that we thankful should be—\r\nWhich we of taste and feeling are—for those parts that do fructify in\r\nus more than he.\r\nFor as it would ill become me to be vain, indiscreet, or a fool,\r\nSo, were there a patch set on learning, to see him in a school.\r\nBut, _omne bene_, say I, being of an old father’s mind;\r\nMany can brook the weather that love not the wind.\r\n\r\nDULL.\r\nYou two are bookmen. Can you tell me by your wit\r\nWhat was a month old at Cain’s birth, that’s not five weeks old as yet?\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\nDictynna, goodman Dull. Dictynna, goodman Dull.\r\n\r\nDULL.\r\nWhat is Dictynna?\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL.\r\nA title to Phoebe, to Luna, to the moon.\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\nThe moon was a month old when Adam was no more,\r\nAnd raught not to five weeks when he came to five-score.\r\nTh’ allusion holds in the exchange.\r\n\r\nDULL.\r\n’Tis true, indeed. The collusion holds in the exchange.\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\nGod comfort thy capacity! I say, th’ allusion holds in the exchange.\r\n\r\nDULL.\r\nAnd I say the pollution holds in the exchange, for the moon is never\r\nbut a month old; and I say beside that ’twas a pricket that the\r\nPrincess killed.\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\nSir Nathaniel, will you hear an extemporal epitaph on the death of the\r\ndeer? And, to humour the ignorant, call I the deer the Princess killed\r\na pricket.\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL.\r\n_Perge_, good Master Holofernes, _perge_, so it shall please you to\r\nabrogate scurrility.\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\nI will something affect the letter; for it argues facility.\r\nThe preyful Princess pierced and pricked a pretty pleasing pricket;\r\nSome say a sore; but not a sore till now made sore with shooting.\r\nThe dogs did yell, put “l” to sore, then sorel jumps from thicket;\r\nOr pricket sore, or else sorel, the people fall a-hooting.\r\nIf sore be sore, then “L” to “sore” makes fifty sores o’ sorel.\r\nOf one sore I an hundred make, by adding but one more “L”.\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL.\r\nA rare talent!\r\n\r\nDULL.\r\n[_Aside_.] If a talent be a claw, look how he claws him with a talent.\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\nThis is a gift that I have, simple, simple; a foolish extravagant\r\nspirit, full of forms, figures, shapes, objects, ideas, apprehensions,\r\nmotions, revolutions. These are begot in the ventricle of memory,\r\nnourished in the womb of _pia mater_, and delivered upon the mellowing\r\nof occasion. But the gift is good in those in whom it is acute, and I\r\nam thankful for it.\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL.\r\nSir, I praise the Lord for you, and so may my parishioners, for their\r\nsons are well tutored by you, and their daughters profit very greatly\r\nunder you. You are a good member of the commonwealth.\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\n_Mehercle!_ If their sons be ingenious, they shall want no instruction;\r\nif their daughters be capable, I will put it to them. But, _vir sapit\r\nqui pauca loquitur_. A soul feminine saluteth us.\r\n\r\nEnter Jaquenetta and Costard.\r\n\r\nJAQUENETTA.\r\nGod give you good morrow, Master Person.\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\nMaster Person, _quasi_ pierce one. And if one should be pierced, which\r\nis the one?\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nMarry, Master schoolmaster, he that is likest to a hogshead.\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\nOf piercing a hogshead! A good lustre or conceit in a turf of earth;\r\nfire enough for a flint, pearl enough for a swine. ’Tis pretty; it is\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nJAQUENETTA.\r\nGood Master Parson, be so good as read me this letter. It was given me\r\nby Costard, and sent me from Don Armado. I beseech you read it.\r\n\r\n[_Giving a letter to Nathaniel._]\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\n_Fauste precor, gelida quando pecus omne sub umbra Ruminat_—\r\nand so forth. Ah, good old Mantuan, I may speak of thee as the\r\ntraveller doth of Venice:\r\n _Venetia, Venetia,\r\n Chi non ti vede, non ti pretia._\r\nOld Mantuan, old Mantuan! Who understandeth thee not, loves thee not.\r\n[_He sings_.]\r\n Ut, re, sol, la, mi, fa.\r\nUnder pardon, sir, what are the contents? Or rather as Horace says in\r\nhis—What, my soul, verses?\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL.\r\nAy, sir, and very learned.\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\nLet me hear a staff, a stanze, a verse,\r\n _Lege, domine_.\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL.\r\n[_Reads_.]\r\n_If love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to love?\r\n Ah, never faith could hold, if not to beauty vowed.\r\nThough to myself forsworn, to thee I’ll faithful prove.\r\n Those thoughts to me were oaks, to thee like osiers bowed.\r\nStudy his bias leaves, and makes his book thine eyes,\r\n Where all those pleasures live that art would comprehend.\r\nIf knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice.\r\n Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend,\r\nAll ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder;\r\n Which is to me some praise, that I thy parts admire.\r\nThy eye Jove’s lightning bears, thy voice his dreadful thunder,\r\n Which, not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire.\r\nCelestial as thou art, O, pardon love this wrong,\r\nThat sings heaven’s praise with such an earthly tongue._\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\nYou find not the apostrophus, and so miss the accent. Let me supervise\r\nthe canzonet. [_He takes the letter_.] Here are only numbers ratified,\r\nbut, for the elegancy, facility, and golden cadence of poesy, _caret_.\r\nOvidius Naso was the man. And why indeed “Naso,” but for smelling out\r\nthe odoriferous flowers of fancy, the jerks of invention? _Imitari_ is\r\nnothing: so doth the hound his master, the ape his keeper, the tired\r\nhorse his rider. But, damosella virgin, was this directed to you?\r\n\r\nJAQUENETTA.\r\nAy, sir, from one Monsieur Berowne, one of the strange queen’s lords.\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\nI will overglance the superscript: _To the snow-white hand of the most\r\nbeauteous Lady Rosaline._ I will look again on the intellect of the\r\nletter, for the nomination of the party writing to the person written\r\nunto: _Your Ladyship’s in all desired employment, Berowne._ Sir\r\nNathaniel, this Berowne is one of the votaries with the King, and here\r\nhe hath framed a letter to a sequent of the stranger queen’s, which\r\naccidentally, or by the way of progression, hath miscarried. Trip and\r\ngo, my sweet, deliver this paper into the royal hand of the King. It\r\nmay concern much. Stay not thy compliment. I forgive thy duty. Adieu.\r\n\r\nJAQUENETTA.\r\nGood Costard, go with me. Sir, God save your life.\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nHave with thee, my girl.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Costard and Jaquenetta._]\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL.\r\nSir, you have done this in the fear of God, very religiously; and, as a\r\ncertain Father saith—\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\nSir, tell not me of the Father, I do fear colourable colours. But to\r\nreturn to the verses: did they please you, Sir Nathaniel?\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL.\r\nMarvellous well for the pen.\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\nI do dine today at the father’s of a certain pupil of mine, where if,\r\nbefore repast, it shall please you to gratify the table with a grace, I\r\nwill, on my privilege I have with the parents of the foresaid child or\r\npupil, undertake your _ben venuto;_ where I will prove those verses to\r\nbe very unlearned, neither savouring of poetry, wit, nor invention. I\r\nbeseech your society.\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL.\r\nAnd thank you too; for society, saith the text, is the happiness of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\nAnd certes, the text most infallibly concludes it. [_To Dull_.] Sir, I\r\ndo invite you too. You shall not say me nay. _Pauca verba_. Away! The\r\ngentles are at their game, and we will to our recreation.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. The same\r\n\r\nEnter Berowne with a paper in his hand, alone.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nThe King, he is hunting the deer; I am coursing myself. They have\r\npitched a toil; I am toiling in a pitch, pitch that defiles. Defile! A\r\nfoul word! Well, set thee down, sorrow, for so they say the fool said,\r\nand so say I, and I the fool. Well proved, wit! By the Lord, this love\r\nis as mad as Ajax. It kills sheep, it kills me, I a sheep. Well proved\r\nagain, o’ my side! I will not love; if I do, hang me! I’ faith, I will\r\nnot. O, but her eye! By this light, but for her eye, I would not love\r\nher; yes, for her two eyes. Well, I do nothing in the world but lie,\r\nand lie in my throat. By heaven, I do love, and it hath taught me to\r\nrhyme, and to be melancholy. And here is part of my rhyme, and here my\r\nmelancholy. Well, she hath one o’ my sonnets already. The clown bore\r\nit, the fool sent it, and the lady hath it. Sweet clown, sweeter fool,\r\nsweetest lady! By the world, I would not care a pin if the other three\r\nwere in. Here comes one with a paper. God give him grace to groan!\r\n\r\n[_He stands aside._]\r\n\r\nEnter the King with a paper.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nAy me!\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\n[_Aside_.] Shot, by heaven!

Black is the badge of hell,\r\nThe hue of dungeons and the school of night;\r\nAnd beauty’s crest becomes the heavens well.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nDevils soonest tempt, resembling spirits of light.\r\nO, if in black my lady’s brows be decked,\r\nIt mourns that painting and usurping hair\r\nShould ravish doters with a false aspect;\r\nAnd therefore is she born to make black fair.\r\nHer favour turns the fashion of the days,\r\nFor native blood is counted painting now;\r\nAnd therefore red, that would avoid dispraise,\r\nPaints itself black, to imitate her brow.\r\n\r\nDUMAINE.\r\nTo look like her are chimney-sweepers black.\r\n\r\nLONGAVILLE.\r\nAnd since her time are colliers counted bright.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nAnd Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack.\r\n\r\nDUMAINE.\r\nDark needs no candles now, for dark is light.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nYour mistresses dare never come in rain,\r\nFor fear their colours should be washed away.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\n’Twere good yours did; for, sir, to tell you plain,\r\nI’ll find a fairer face not washed today.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nI’ll prove her fair, or talk till doomsday here.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nNo devil will fright thee then so much as she.\r\n\r\nDUMAINE.\r\nI never knew man hold vile stuff so dear.\r\n\r\nLONGAVILLE.\r\n[_Showing his shoe_.]\r\nLook, here’s thy love, my foot and her face see.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nO, if the streets were paved with thine eyes,\r\nHer feet were much too dainty for such tread.\r\n\r\nDUMAINE.\r\nO vile! Then, as she goes, what upward lies\r\nThe street should see as she walked over head.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nBut what of this? Are we not all in love?\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nNothing so sure, and thereby all forsworn.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nThen leave this chat, and, good Berowne, now prove\r\nOur loving lawful, and our faith not torn.\r\n\r\nDUMAINE.\r\nAy, marry, there; some flattery for this evil.\r\n\r\nLONGAVILLE.\r\nO, some authority how to proceed.\r\nSome tricks, some quillets, how to cheat the devil.\r\n\r\nDUMAINE.\r\nSome salve for perjury.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nO, ’tis more than need.\r\nHave at you, then, affection’s men-at-arms.\r\nConsider what you first did swear unto:\r\nTo fast, to study, and to see no woman—\r\nFlat treason ’gainst the kingly state of youth.\r\nSay, can you fast? Your stomachs are too young,\r\nAnd abstinence engenders maladies.\r\nO, we have made a vow to study, lords,\r\nAnd in that vow we have forsworn our books;\r\nFor when would you, my liege, or you, or you,\r\nIn leaden contemplation have found out\r\nSuch fiery numbers as the prompting eyes\r\nOf beauty’s tutors have enriched you with?\r\nOther slow arts entirely keep the brain,\r\nAnd therefore, finding barren practisers,\r\nScarce show a harvest of their heavy toil;\r\nBut love, first learned in a lady’s eyes,\r\nLives not alone immured in the brain,\r\nBut with the motion of all elements\r\nCourses as swift as thought in every power,\r\nAnd gives to every power a double power,\r\nAbove their functions and their offices.\r\nIt adds a precious seeing to the eye.\r\nA lover’s eyes will gaze an eagle blind.\r\nA lover’s ear will hear the lowest sound,\r\nWhen the suspicious head of theft is stopped.\r\nLove’s feeling is more soft and sensible\r\nThan are the tender horns of cockled snails.\r\nLove’s tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste.\r\nFor valour, is not Love a Hercules,\r\nStill climbing trees in the Hesperides?\r\nSubtle as Sphinx, as sweet and musical\r\nAs bright Apollo’s lute, strung with his hair.\r\nAnd when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods\r\nMake heaven drowsy with the harmony.\r\nNever durst poet touch a pen to write\r\nUntil his ink were tempered with Love’s sighs.\r\nO, then his lines would ravish savage ears\r\nAnd plant in tyrants mild humility.\r\nFrom women’s eyes this doctrine I derive.\r\nThey sparkle still the right Promethean fire;\r\nThey are the books, the arts, the academes,\r\nThat show, contain, and nourish, all the world;\r\nElse none at all in aught proves excellent.\r\nThen fools you were these women to forswear,\r\nOr, keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.\r\nFor wisdom’s sake, a word that all men love,\r\nOr for love’s sake, a word that loves all men,\r\nOr for men’s sake, the authors of these women,\r\nOr women’s sake, by whom we men are men,\r\nLet us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,\r\nOr else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.\r\nIt is religion to be thus forsworn,\r\nFor charity itself fulfils the law,\r\nAnd who can sever love from charity?\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nSaint Cupid, then, and, soldiers, to the field!\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nAdvance your standards, and upon them, lords!\r\nPell-mell, down with them! But be first advised\r\nIn conflict that you get the sun of them.\r\n\r\nLONGAVILLE.\r\nNow to plain dealing. Lay these glozes by.\r\nShall we resolve to woo these girls of France?\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nAnd win them too. Therefore let us devise\r\nSome entertainment for them in their tents.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nFirst, from the park let us conduct them thither.\r\nThen homeward every man attach the hand\r\nOf his fair mistress. In the afternoon\r\nWe will with some strange pastime solace them,\r\nSuch as the shortness of the time can shape;\r\nFor revels, dances, masques, and merry hours\r\nForerun fair Love, strewing her way with flowers.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nAway, away! No time shall be omitted\r\nThat will betime and may by us be fitted.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\n_Allons! allons!_ Sowed cockle reaped no corn,\r\nAnd justice always whirls in equal measure.\r\nLight wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn;\r\nIf so, our copper buys no better treasure.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\nACT V\r\n\r\nSCENE I. The King of Navarre’s park\r\n\nEnter Holofernes, Sir Nathaniel and Dull.\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\n_Satis quod sufficit._\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL.\r\nI praise God for you, sir. Your reasons at dinner have been sharp and\r\nsententious, pleasant without scurrility, witty without affection,\r\naudacious without impudency, learned without opinion, and strange\r\nwithout heresy. I did converse this _quondam_ day with a companion of\r\nthe King’s, who is intituled, nominated, or called, Don Adriano de\r\nArmado.\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\n_Novi hominem tanquam te._ His humour is lofty, his discourse\r\nperemptory, his tongue filed, his eye ambitious, his gait majestical\r\nand his general behaviour vain, ridiculous, and thrasonical. He is too\r\npicked, too spruce, too affected, too odd, as it were, too peregrinate,\r\nas I may call it.\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL.\r\nA most singular and choice epithet.\r\n\r\n[_Draws out his table-book._]\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\nHe draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer than the staple of his\r\nargument. I abhor such fanatical phantasimes, such insociable and\r\npoint-devise companions, such rackers of orthography, as to speak\r\n“dout” _sine_ “b”, when he should say “doubt”, “det” when he should\r\npronounce “debt”—_d, e, b, t_, not _d, e, t_. He clepeth a calf “cauf”,\r\nhalf “hauf”; neighbour _vocatur_ “nebour”, neigh abbreviated “ne”. This\r\nis abhominable, which he would call “abominable”. It insinuateth me of\r\ninsanie. _Ne intelligis, domine?_ To make frantic, lunatic.\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL.\r\n_Laus Deo, bone intelligo._\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\n_Bone? Bone_ for _bene?_ Priscian a little scratched; ’twill serve.\r\n\r\nEnter Armado, Moth and Costard.\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL.\r\n_Videsne quis venit?_\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\n_Video, et gaudeo._\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\n_Chirrah!_\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\n_Quare_ “chirrah”, not “sirrah”?\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nMen of peace, well encountered.\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\nMost military sir, salutation.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\n[_Aside to Costard_.] They have been at a great feast of languages and\r\nstolen the scraps.\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nO, they have lived long on the almsbasket of words. I marvel thy master\r\nhath not eaten thee for a word, for thou art not so long by the head as\r\n_honorificabilitudinitatibus_. Thou art easier swallowed than a\r\nflap-dragon.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nPeace! The peal begins.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\n[_To Holofernes_.] Monsieur, are you not lettered?\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nYes, yes, he teaches boys the hornbook. What is _a, b_, spelt backward\r\nwith the horn on his head?\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\n_Ba, pueritia_, with a horn added.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\n_Ba_, most silly sheep with a horn. You hear his learning.\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\n_Quis, quis_, thou consonant?\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nThe third of the five vowels, if you repeat them; or the fifth, if I.\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\nI will repeat them: _a, e, i_—\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nThe sheep. The other two concludes it: _o, u_.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nNow, by the salt wave of the Mediterraneum, a sweet touch, a quick\r\nvenue of wit! Snip, snap, quick and home! It rejoiceth my intellect.\r\nTrue wit!\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nOffered by a child to an old man—which is wit-old.\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\nWhat is the figure? What is the figure?\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nHorns.\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\nThou disputes like an infant. Go whip thy gig.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nLend me your horn to make one, and I will whip about your infamy _unum\r\ncita_. A gig of a cuckold’s horn.\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nAn I had but one penny in the world, thou shouldst have it to buy\r\ngingerbread. Hold, there is the very remuneration I had of thy master,\r\nthou halfpenny purse of wit, thou pigeon-egg of discretion. O, an the\r\nheavens were so pleased that thou wert but my bastard, what a joyful\r\nfather wouldst thou make me! Go to, thou hast it _ad dunghill_, at the\r\nfingers’ ends, as they say.\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\nO, I smell false Latin! _Dunghill_ for _unguem_.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nArts-man, preambulate. We will be singuled from the barbarous. Do you\r\nnot educate youth at the charge-house on the top of the mountain?\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\nOr _mons_, the hill.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nAt your sweet pleasure, for the mountain.\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\nI do, _sans question_.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nSir, it is the King’s most sweet pleasure and affection to congratulate\r\nthe Princess at her pavilion in the posteriors of this day, which the\r\nrude multitude call the afternoon.\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\nThe posterior of the day, most generous sir, is liable, congruent, and\r\nmeasurable for the afternoon. The word is well culled, chose, sweet,\r\nand apt, I do assure you, sir, I do assure.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nSir, the King is a noble gentleman, and my familiar, I do assure ye,\r\nvery good friend. For what is inward between us, let it pass. I do\r\nbeseech thee, remember thy courtesy; I beseech thee, apparel thy head.\r\nAnd among other importunate and most serious designs, and of great\r\nimport indeed, too—but let that pass. For I must tell thee it will\r\nplease his Grace, by the world, sometime to lean upon my poor shoulder\r\nand with his royal finger thus dally with my excrement, with my\r\nmustachio. But, sweet heart, let that pass. By the world, I recount no\r\nfable! Some certain special honours it pleaseth his greatness to impart\r\nto Armado, a soldier, a man of travel, that hath seen the world. But\r\nlet that pass. The very all of all is—but, sweet heart, I do implore\r\nsecrecy—that the King would have me present the Princess, sweet chuck,\r\nwith some delightful ostentation, or show, or pageant, or antic, or\r\nfirework. Now, understanding that the curate and your sweet self are\r\ngood at such eruptions and sudden breaking-out of mirth, as it were, I\r\nhave acquainted you withal, to the end to crave your assistance.\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\nSir, you shall present before her the Nine Worthies. Sir Nathaniel, as\r\nconcerning some entertainment of time, some show in the posterior of\r\nthis day, to be rendered by our assistance, the King’s command, and\r\nthis most gallant, illustrate, and learned gentleman, before the\r\nPrincess, I say, none so fit as to present the Nine Worthies.\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL.\r\nWhere will you find men worthy enough to present them?\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\nJoshua, yourself; myself; and this gallant gentleman, Judas Maccabaeus.\r\nThis swain, because of his great limb or joint, shall pass Pompey the\r\nGreat; the page, Hercules.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nPardon, sir; error. He is not quantity enough for that Worthy’s thumb;\r\nhe is not so big as the end of his club.\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\nShall I have audience? He shall present Hercules in minority. His enter\r\nand exit shall be strangling a snake; and I will have an apology for\r\nthat purpose.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nAn excellent device! So, if any of the audience hiss, you may cry “Well\r\ndone, Hercules, now thou crushest the snake!” That is the way to make\r\nan offence gracious, though few have the grace to do it.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nFor the rest of the Worthies?\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\nI will play three myself.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nThrice-worthy gentleman!\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nShall I tell you a thing?\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\nWe attend.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nWe will have, if this fadge not, an antic. I beseech you, follow.\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\n_Via_, goodman Dull! Thou has spoken no word all this while.\r\n\r\nDULL.\r\nNor understood none neither, sir.\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\n_Allons!_ we will employ thee.\r\n\r\nDULL.\r\nI’ll make one in a dance, or so; or I will play on the tabor to the\r\nWorthies, and let them dance the hay.\r\n\r\nHOLOFERNES.\r\nMost dull, honest Dull! To our sport, away.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. The same. Before the Princess’s pavilion\r\n\r\nEnter the Princess, Rosaline, Katharine and Maria.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nSweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,\r\nIf fairings come thus plentifully in.\r\nA lady walled about with diamonds!\r\nLook you what I have from the loving King.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nMadam, came nothing else along with that?\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nNothing but this? Yes, as much love in rhyme\r\nAs would be crammed up in a sheet of paper\r\nWrit o’ both sides the leaf, margent and all,\r\nThat he was fain to seal on Cupid’s name.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nThat was the way to make his godhead wax,\r\nFor he hath been five thousand years a boy.\r\n\r\nKATHARINE.\r\nAy, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nYou’ll ne’er be friends with him. He killed your sister.\r\n\r\nKATHARINE.\r\nHe made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;\r\nAnd so she died. Had she been light, like you,\r\nOf such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit,\r\nShe might ha’ been a grandam ere she died.\r\nAnd so may you, for a light heart lives long.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nWhat’s your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?\r\n\r\nKATHARINE.\r\nA light condition in a beauty dark.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nWe need more light to find your meaning out.\r\n\r\nKATHARINE.\r\nYou’ll mar the light by taking it in snuff;\r\nTherefore I’ll darkly end the argument.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nLook what you do, you do it still i’ th’ dark.\r\n\r\nKATHARINE.\r\nSo do not you, for you are a light wench.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nIndeed, I weigh not you, and therefore light.\r\n\r\nKATHARINE.\r\nYou weigh me not? O, that’s you care not for me.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nGreat reason, for past cure is still past care.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nWell bandied both; a set of wit well played.\r\nBut, Rosaline, you have a favour too.\r\nWho sent it? And what is it?\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nI would you knew.\r\nAn if my face were but as fair as yours,\r\nMy favour were as great. Be witness this.\r\nNay, I have verses too, I thank Berowne;\r\nThe numbers true, and, were the numbering too,\r\nI were the fairest goddess on the ground.\r\nI am compared to twenty thousand fairs.\r\nO, he hath drawn my picture in his letter.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nAnything like?\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nMuch in the letters, nothing in the praise.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nBeauteous as ink: a good conclusion.\r\n\r\nKATHARINE.\r\nFair as a text B in a copy-book.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\n’Ware pencils, how! Let me not die your debtor,\r\nMy red dominical, my golden letter.\r\nO, that your face were not so full of O’s!\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nA pox of that jest! And beshrew all shrews.\r\nBut, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair Dumaine?\r\n\r\nKATHARINE.\r\nMadam, this glove.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nDid he not send you twain?\r\n\r\nKATHARINE.\r\nYes, madam, and moreover,\r\nSome thousand verses of a faithful lover.\r\nA huge translation of hypocrisy,\r\nVilely compiled, profound simplicity.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nThis, and these pearls, to me sent Longaville.\r\nThe letter is too long by half a mile.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nI think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart\r\nThe chain were longer and the letter short?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nAy, or I would these hands might never part.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nWe are wise girls to mock our lovers so.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nThey are worse fools to purchase mocking so.\r\nThat same Berowne I’ll torture ere I go.\r\nO that I knew he were but in by th’ week!\r\nHow I would make him fawn, and beg, and seek,\r\nAnd wait the season, and observe the times,\r\nAnd spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes,\r\nAnd shape his service wholly to my hests,\r\nAnd make him proud to make me proud that jests!\r\nSo pair-taunt-like would I o’ersway his state,\r\nThat he should be my fool, and I his fate.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nNone are so surely caught, when they are catched,\r\nAs wit turned fool. Folly, in wisdom hatched,\r\nHath wisdom’s warrant and the help of school\r\nAnd wit’s own grace to grace a learned fool.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nThe blood of youth burns not with such excess\r\nAs gravity’s revolt to wantonness.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nFolly in fools bears not so strong a note\r\nAs fool’ry in the wise when wit doth dote,\r\nSince all the power thereof it doth apply\r\nTo prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.\r\n\r\nEnter Boyet.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nHere comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.\r\n\r\nBOYET.\r\nO, I am stabbed with laughter! Where’s her Grace?\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nThy news, Boyet?\r\n\r\nBOYET.\r\nPrepare, madam, prepare!\r\nArm, wenches, arm! Encounters mounted are\r\nAgainst your peace. Love doth approach disguised,\r\nArmed in arguments. You’ll be surprised.\r\nMuster your wits, stand in your own defence,\r\nOr hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nSaint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are they\r\nThat charge their breath against us? Say, scout, say.\r\n\r\nBOYET.\r\nUnder the cool shade of a sycamore\r\nI thought to close mine eyes some half an hour,\r\nWhen, lo, to interrupt my purposed rest,\r\nToward that shade I might behold addressed\r\nThe King and his companions. Warily\r\nI stole into a neighbour thicket by,\r\nAnd overheard what you shall overhear:\r\nThat, by and by, disguised they will be here.\r\nTheir herald is a pretty knavish page\r\nThat well by heart hath conned his embassage.\r\nAction and accent did they teach him there:\r\n“Thus must thou speak,” and “thus thy body bear.”\r\nAnd ever and anon they made a doubt\r\nPresence majestical would put him out;\r\n“For,” quoth the King, “an angel shalt thou see;\r\nYet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.”\r\nThe boy replied “An angel is not evil;\r\nI should have feared her had she been a devil.”\r\nWith that all laughed and clapped him on the shoulder,\r\nMaking the bold wag by their praises bolder.\r\nOne rubbed his elbow thus, and fleered, and swore\r\nA better speech was never spoke before.\r\nAnother with his finger and his thumb\r\nCried “_Via_, we will do ’t, come what will come.”\r\nThe third he capered, and cried “All goes well!”\r\nThe fourth turned on the toe, and down he fell.\r\nWith that they all did tumble on the ground,\r\nWith such a zealous laughter, so profound,\r\nThat in this spleen ridiculous appears,\r\nTo check their folly, passion’s solemn tears.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nBut what, but what, come they to visit us?\r\n\r\nBOYET.\r\nThey do, they do, and are apparelled thus,\r\nLike Muscovites, or Russians, as I guess.\r\nTheir purpose is to parley, court, and dance,\r\nAnd every one his love-feat will advance\r\nUnto his several mistress, which they’ll know\r\nBy favours several which they did bestow.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nAnd will they so? The gallants shall be tasked;\r\nFor, ladies, we will every one be masked,\r\nAnd not a man of them shall have the grace,\r\nDespite of suit, to see a lady’s face.\r\nHold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,\r\nAnd then the King will court thee for his dear.\r\nHold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,\r\nSo shall Berowne take me for Rosaline.\r\nAnd change you favours too; so shall your loves\r\nWoo contrary, deceived by these removes.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nCome on, then, wear the favours most in sight.\r\n\r\nKATHARINE.\r\nBut in this changing, what is your intent?\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nThe effect of my intent is to cross theirs.\r\nThey do it but in mocking merriment,\r\nAnd mock for mock is only my intent.\r\nTheir several counsels they unbosom shall\r\nTo loves mistook, and so be mocked withal\r\nUpon the next occasion that we meet,\r\nWith visages displayed to talk and greet.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nBut shall we dance, if they desire us to’t?\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nNo, to the death we will not move a foot,\r\nNor to their penned speech render we no grace,\r\nBut while ’tis spoke each turn away her face.\r\n\r\nBOYET.\r\nWhy, that contempt will kill the speaker’s heart,\r\nAnd quite divorce his memory from his part.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nTherefore I do it, and I make no doubt\r\nThe rest will ne’er come in, if he be out.\r\nThere’s no such sport as sport by sport o’erthrown,\r\nTo make theirs ours and ours none but our own.\r\nSo shall we stay, mocking intended game,\r\nAnd they, well mocked, depart away with shame.\r\n\r\n[_Sound trumpet, within._]\r\n\r\nBOYET.\r\nThe trumpet sounds. Be masked; the maskers come.\r\n\r\n[_The Ladies mask._]\r\n\r\nEnter Blackamoors with music, Moth, with a speech, the King, Berowne,\r\nLongaville and Dumaine disguised.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\n_All hail, the richest beauties on the earth!_\r\n\r\nBOYET.\r\nBeauties no richer than rich taffeta.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\n_A holy parcel of the fairest dames_\r\n\r\n[_The Ladies turn their backs to him._]\r\n\r\n_That ever turned their_—backs—_to mortal views!_\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\n_Their eyes_, villain, _their eyes._\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\n_That ever turned their eyes to mortal views.\r\nOut_—\r\n\r\nBOYET.\r\nTrue; out indeed.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\n_Out of your favours, heavenly spirits, vouchsafe\r\nNot to behold_—\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\n_Once to behold_, rogue!\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\n_Once to behold with your sun-beamed eyes—\r\nWith your sun-beamed eyes_—\r\n\r\nBOYET.\r\nThey will not answer to that epithet.\r\nYou were best call it “daughter-beamed eyes”.\r\n\r\nMOTH.\r\nThey do not mark me, and that brings me out.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nIs this your perfectness? Be gone, you rogue!\r\n\r\n[_Exit Moth._]\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nWhat would these strangers? Know their minds, Boyet.\r\nIf they do speak our language, ’tis our will\r\nThat some plain man recount their purposes.\r\nKnow what they would.\r\n\r\nBOYET.\r\nWhat would you with the Princess?\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nNothing but peace and gentle visitation.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nWhat would they, say they?\r\n\r\nBOYET.\r\nNothing but peace and gentle visitation.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nWhy, that they have, and bid them so be gone.\r\n\r\nBOYET.\r\nShe says you have it, and you may be gone.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nSay to her we have measured many miles\r\nTo tread a measure with her on this grass.\r\n\r\nBOYET.\r\nThey say that they have measured many a mile\r\nTo tread a measure with you on this grass.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nIt is not so. Ask them how many inches\r\nIs in one mile? If they have measured many,\r\nThe measure then of one is easily told.\r\n\r\nBOYET.\r\nIf to come hither you have measured miles,\r\nAnd many miles, the Princess bids you tell\r\nHow many inches doth fill up one mile.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nTell her we measure them by weary steps.\r\n\r\nBOYET.\r\nShe hears herself.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nHow many weary steps\r\nOf many weary miles you have o’ergone\r\nAre numbered in the travel of one mile?\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nWe number nothing that we spend for you.\r\nOur duty is so rich, so infinite,\r\nThat we may do it still without account.\r\nVouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face,\r\nThat we, like savages, may worship it.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nMy face is but a moon, and clouded too.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nBlessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do!\r\nVouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars, to shine,\r\nThose clouds removed, upon our watery eyne.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nO vain petitioner! Beg a greater matter!\r\nThou now requests but moonshine in the water.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nThen in our measure do but vouchsafe one change.\r\nThou bidd’st me beg; this begging is not strange.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nPlay, music, then! Nay, you must do it soon.\r\n\r\n[_Music plays._]\r\n\r\nNot yet? No dance! Thus change I like the moon.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nWill you not dance? How come you thus estranged?\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nYou took the moon at full, but now she’s changed.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nYet still she is the moon, and I the man.\r\nThe music plays, vouchsafe some motion to it.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nOur ears vouchsafe it.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nBut your legs should do it.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nSince you are strangers and come here by chance,\r\nWe’ll not be nice. Take hands. We will not dance.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nWhy take we hands then?\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nOnly to part friends.\r\nCurtsy, sweet hearts, and so the measure ends.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nMore measure of this measure! Be not nice.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nWe can afford no more at such a price.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nPrice you yourselves? What buys your company?\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nYour absence only.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nThat can never be.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nThen cannot we be bought. And so adieu—\r\nTwice to your visor, and half once to you!\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nIf you deny to dance, let’s hold more chat.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nIn private then.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nI am best pleased with that.\r\n\r\n[_They converse apart._]\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nWhite-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nHoney, and milk, and sugar: there is three.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nNay, then, two treys, an if you grow so nice,\r\nMetheglin, wort, and malmsey. Well run, dice!\r\nThere’s half a dozen sweets.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nSeventh sweet, adieu.\r\nSince you can cog, I’ll play no more with you.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nOne word in secret.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nLet it not be sweet.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nThou griev’st my gall.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nGall! Bitter.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nTherefore meet.\r\n\r\n[_They converse apart._]\r\n\r\nDUMAINE.\r\nWill you vouchsafe with me to change a word?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nName it.\r\n\r\nDUMAINE.\r\nFair lady—\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nSay you so? Fair lord!\r\nTake that for your “fair lady”.\r\n\r\nDUMAINE.\r\nPlease it you,\r\nAs much in private, and I’ll bid adieu.\r\n\r\n[_They converse apart._]\r\n\r\nKATHARINE.\r\nWhat, was your visor made without a tongue?\r\n\r\nLONGAVILLE.\r\nI know the reason, lady, why you ask.\r\n\r\nKATHARINE.\r\nO, for your reason! Quickly, sir, I long.\r\n\r\nLONGAVILLE.\r\nYou have a double tongue within your mask,\r\nAnd would afford my speechless visor half.\r\n\r\nKATHARINE.\r\n“Veal”, quoth the Dutchman. Is not veal a calf?\r\n\r\nLONGAVILLE.\r\nA calf, fair lady?\r\n\r\nKATHARINE.\r\nNo, a fair lord calf.\r\n\r\nLONGAVILLE.\r\nLet’s part the word.\r\n\r\nKATHARINE.\r\nNo, I’ll not be your half.\r\nTake all and wean it; it may prove an ox.\r\n\r\nLONGAVILLE.\r\nLook how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks.\r\nWill you give horns, chaste lady? Do not so.\r\n\r\nKATHARINE.\r\nThen die a calf before your horns do grow.\r\n\r\nLONGAVILLE.\r\nOne word in private with you ere I die.\r\n\r\nKATHARINE.\r\nBleat softly, then; the butcher hears you cry.\r\n\r\n[_They converse apart._]\r\n\r\nBOYET.\r\nThe tongues of mocking wenches are as keen\r\n As is the razor’s edge invisible,\r\nCutting a smaller hair than may be seen;\r\n Above the sense of sense, so sensible\r\nSeemeth their conference. Their conceits have wings\r\nFleeter than arrows, bullets, wind, thought, swifter things.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nNot one word more, my maids; break off, break off.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nBy heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nFarewell, mad wenches. You have simple wits.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt King, Lords and Blackamoors._]\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nTwenty adieus, my frozen Muscovites.\r\nAre these the breed of wits so wondered at?\r\n\r\nBOYET.\r\nTapers they are, with your sweet breaths puffed out.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nWell-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat, fat.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nO poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!\r\nWill they not, think you, hang themselves tonight?\r\nOr ever but in vizors show their faces?\r\nThis pert Berowne was out of countenance quite.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nThey were all in lamentable cases.\r\nThe King was weeping-ripe for a good word.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nBerowne did swear himself out of all suit.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nDumaine was at my service, and his sword.\r\n“_Non point_,” quoth I; my servant straight was mute.\r\n\r\nKATHARINE.\r\nLord Longaville said I came o’er his heart;\r\nAnd trow you what he called me?\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nQualm, perhaps.\r\n\r\nKATHARINE.\r\nYes, in good faith.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nGo, sickness as thou art!\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nWell, better wits have worn plain statute-caps.\r\nBut will you hear? The King is my love sworn.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nAnd quick Berowne hath plighted faith to me.\r\n\r\nKATHARINE.\r\nAnd Longaville was for my service born.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nDumaine is mine as sure as bark on tree.\r\n\r\nBOYET.\r\nMadam, and pretty mistresses, give ear.\r\nImmediately they will again be here\r\nIn their own shapes, for it can never be\r\nThey will digest this harsh indignity.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nWill they return?\r\n\r\nBOYET.\r\nThey will, they will, God knows,\r\nAnd leap for joy, though they are lame with blows.\r\nTherefore, change favours and, when they repair,\r\nBlow like sweet roses in this summer air.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nHow “blow”? How “blow”? Speak to be understood.\r\n\r\nBOYET.\r\nFair ladies masked are roses in their bud.\r\nDismasked, their damask sweet commixture shown,\r\nAre angels vailing clouds, or roses blown.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nAvaunt, perplexity! What shall we do\r\nIf they return in their own shapes to woo?\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nGood madam, if by me you’ll be advised,\r\nLet’s mock them still, as well known as disguised.\r\nLet us complain to them what fools were here,\r\nDisguised like Muscovites in shapeless gear;\r\nAnd wonder what they were, and to what end\r\nTheir shallow shows and prologue vilely penned,\r\nAnd their rough carriage so ridiculous,\r\nShould be presented at our tent to us.\r\n\r\nBOYET.\r\nLadies, withdraw. The gallants are at hand.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nWhip to our tents, as roes run o’er the land.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Princess, Rosaline, Katharine and Maria._]\r\n\r\nEnter the King, Berowne, Longaville and Dumaine as themselves.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nFair sir, God save you. Where’s the Princess?\r\n\r\nBOYET.\r\nGone to her tent. Please it your Majesty\r\nCommand me any service to her thither?\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nThat she vouchsafe me audience for one word.\r\n\r\nBOYET.\r\nI will; and so will she, I know, my lord.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nThis fellow pecks up wit as pigeons peas\r\nAnd utters it again when God doth please.\r\nHe is wit’s pedlar, and retails his wares\r\nAt wakes and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs;\r\nAnd we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know,\r\nHave not the grace to grace it with such show.\r\nThis gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve.\r\nHad he been Adam, he had tempted Eve.\r\nHe can carve too, and lisp. Why, this is he\r\nThat kissed his hand away in courtesy.\r\nThis is the ape of form, Monsieur the Nice,\r\nThat, when he plays at tables, chides the dice\r\nIn honourable terms. Nay, he can sing\r\nA mean most meanly; and in ushering\r\nMend him who can. The ladies call him sweet.\r\nThe stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet.\r\nThis is the flower that smiles on everyone,\r\nTo show his teeth as white as whale’s bone;\r\nAnd consciences that will not die in debt\r\nPay him the due of “honey-tongued Boyet”.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nA blister on his sweet tongue, with my heart,\r\nThat put Armado’s page out of his part!\r\n\r\nEnter the Princess, Rosaline, Maria, Katharine with Boyet.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nSee where it comes! Behaviour, what wert thou\r\nTill this man showed thee, and what art thou now?\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nAll hail, sweet madam, and fair time of day.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\n“Fair” in “all hail” is foul, as I conceive.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nConstrue my speeches better, if you may.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nThen wish me better. I will give you leave.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nWe came to visit you, and purpose now\r\nTo lead you to our court. Vouchsafe it then.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nThis field shall hold me, and so hold your vow.\r\nNor God nor I delights in perjured men.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nRebuke me not for that which you provoke.\r\nThe virtue of your eye must break my oath.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nYou nickname virtue: “vice” you should have spoke;\r\nFor virtue’s office never breaks men’s troth.\r\nNow by my maiden honour, yet as pure\r\nAs the unsullied lily, I protest,\r\nA world of torments though I should endure,\r\nI would not yield to be your house’s guest,\r\nSo much I hate a breaking cause to be\r\nOf heavenly oaths, vowed with integrity.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nO, you have lived in desolation here,\r\nUnseen, unvisited, much to our shame.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nNot so, my lord. It is not so, I swear.\r\nWe have had pastimes here and pleasant game.\r\nA mess of Russians left us but of late.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nHow, madam? Russians?\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nAy, in truth, my lord.\r\nTrim gallants, full of courtship and of state.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nMadam, speak true. It is not so, my lord.\r\nMy lady, to the manner of the days,\r\nIn courtesy gives undeserving praise.\r\nWe four indeed confronted were with four\r\nIn Russian habit. Here they stayed an hour\r\nAnd talked apace; and in that hour, my lord,\r\nThey did not bless us with one happy word.\r\nI dare not call them fools; but this I think,\r\nWhen they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nThis jest is dry to me. My gentle sweet,\r\nYour wit makes wise things foolish. When we greet,\r\nWith eyes’ best seeing, heaven’s fiery eye,\r\nBy light we lose light. Your capacity\r\nIs of that nature that to your huge store\r\nWise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nThis proves you wise and rich, for in my eye—\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nI am a fool, and full of poverty.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nBut that you take what doth to you belong,\r\nIt were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nO, I am yours, and all that I possess.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nAll the fool mine?\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nI cannot give you less.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nWhich of the visors was it that you wore?\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nWhere, when, what visor? Why demand you this?\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nThere, then, that visor; that superfluous case\r\nThat hid the worse and showed the better face.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nWe are descried. They’ll mock us now downright.\r\n\r\nDUMAINE.\r\nLet us confess and turn it to a jest.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nAmazed, my lord? Why looks your Highness sad?\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nHelp! Hold his brows! He’ll swoon. Why look you pale?\r\nSeasick, I think, coming from Muscovy.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nThus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.\r\nCan any face of brass hold longer out?\r\nHere stand I, lady; dart thy skill at me.\r\nBruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout,\r\nThrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance,\r\nCut me to pieces with thy keen conceit,\r\nAnd I will wish thee never more to dance,\r\nNor never more in Russian habit wait.\r\nO, never will I trust to speeches penned,\r\nNor to the motion of a school-boy’s tongue,\r\nNor never come in visor to my friend,\r\nNor woo in rhyme like a blind harper’s song.\r\nTaffeta phrases, silken terms precise,\r\nThree-piled hyperboles, spruce affectation,\r\nFigures pedantical: these summer flies\r\nHave blown me full of maggot ostentation.\r\nI do forswear them, and I here protest,\r\nBy this white glove—how white the hand, God knows!—\r\nHenceforth my wooing mind shall be expressed\r\nIn russet yeas and honest kersey noes.\r\nAnd, to begin: wench, so God help me, law,\r\nMy love to thee is sound, _sans_ crack or flaw.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\n_Sans_ “_sans_,” I pray you.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nYet I have a trick\r\nOf the old rage. Bear with me, I am sick;\r\nI’ll leave it by degrees. Soft, let us see:\r\nWrite “Lord have mercy on us” on those three.\r\nThey are infected; in their hearts it lies;\r\nThey have the plague, and caught it of your eyes.\r\nThese lords are visited. You are not free,\r\nFor the Lord’s tokens on you do I see.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nNo, they are free that gave these tokens to us.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nOur states are forfeit. Seek not to undo us.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nIt is not so. For how can this be true,\r\nThat you stand forfeit, being those that sue?\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nPeace! for I will not have to do with you.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nNor shall not, if I do as I intend.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nSpeak for yourselves. My wit is at an end.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nTeach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgression\r\nSome fair excuse.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nThe fairest is confession.\r\nWere not you here but even now, disguised?\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nMadam, I was.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nAnd were you well advised?\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nI was, fair madam.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nWhen you then were here,\r\nWhat did you whisper in your lady’s ear?\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nThat more than all the world I did respect her.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nWhen she shall challenge this, you will reject her.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nUpon mine honour, no.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nPeace, peace, forbear!\r\nYour oath once broke, you force not to forswear.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nDespise me when I break this oath of mine.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nI will; and therefore keep it. Rosaline,\r\nWhat did the Russian whisper in your ear?\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nMadam, he swore that he did hold me dear\r\nAs precious eyesight, and did value me\r\nAbove this world; adding thereto, moreover,\r\nThat he would wed me, or else die my lover.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nGod give thee joy of him! The noble lord\r\nMost honourably doth uphold his word.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nWhat mean you, madam? By my life, my troth,\r\nI never swore this lady such an oath.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nBy heaven, you did! And to confirm it plain,\r\nYou gave me this. But take it, sir, again.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nMy faith and this the Princess I did give.\r\nI knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nPardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear,\r\nAnd Lord Berowne, I thank him, is my dear.\r\nWhat, will you have me, or your pearl again?\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nNeither of either; I remit both twain.\r\nI see the trick on’t. Here was a consent,\r\nKnowing aforehand of our merriment,\r\nTo dash it like a Christmas comedy.\r\nSome carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,\r\nSome mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,\r\nThat smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick\r\nTo make my lady laugh when she’s disposed,\r\nTold our intents before; which once disclosed,\r\nThe ladies did change favours, and then we,\r\nFollowing the signs, wooed but the sign of she.\r\nNow, to our perjury to add more terror,\r\nWe are again forsworn in will and error.\r\nMuch upon this ’tis. [_To Boyet_.] And might not you\r\nForestall our sport, to make us thus untrue?\r\nDo not you know my lady’s foot by th’ squier,\r\nAnd laugh upon the apple of her eye?\r\nAnd stand between her back, sir, and the fire,\r\nHolding a trencher, jesting merrily?\r\nYou put our page out. Go, you are allowed;\r\nDie when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.\r\nYou leer upon me, do you? There’s an eye\r\nWounds like a leaden sword.\r\n\r\nBOYET.\r\nFull merrily\r\nHath this brave manage, this career, been run.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nLo, he is tilting straight! Peace! I have done.\r\n\r\nEnter Costard.\r\n\r\nWelcome, pure wit! Thou part’st a fair fray.\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nO Lord, sir, they would know\r\nWhether the three Worthies shall come in or no.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nWhat, are there but three?\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nNo, sir; but it is vara fine,\r\nFor every one pursents three.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nAnd three times thrice is nine.\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nNot so, sir, under correction, sir, I hope it is not so.\r\nYou cannot beg us, sir, I can assure you, sir; we know what we know.\r\nI hope, sir, three times thrice, sir—\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nIs not nine?\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nUnder correction, sir, we know whereuntil it doth amount.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nBy Jove, I always took three threes for nine.\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nO Lord, sir, it were pity you should get your living by reckoning, sir.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nHow much is it?\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nO Lord, sir, the parties themselves, the actors, sir, will show\r\nwhereuntil it doth amount. For mine own part, I am, as they say, but to\r\nparfect one man in one poor man—Pompion the Great, sir.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nArt thou one of the Worthies?\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nIt pleased them to think me worthy of Pompey the Great. For mine own\r\npart, I know not the degree of the Worthy, but I am to stand for him.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nGo bid them prepare.\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nWe will turn it finely off, sir; we will take some care.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Costard._]\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nBerowne, they will shame us. Let them not approach.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nWe are shame-proof, my lord, and ’tis some policy\r\nTo have one show worse than the King’s and his company.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nI say they shall not come.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nNay, my good lord, let me o’errule you now.\r\nThat sport best pleases that doth least know how,\r\nWhere zeal strives to content, and the contents\r\nDie in the zeal of that which it presents;\r\nTheir form confounded makes most form in mirth,\r\nWhen great things labouring perish in their birth.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nA right description of our sport, my lord.\r\n\r\nEnter Armado, the Braggart.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nAnointed, I implore so much expense of thy royal sweet breath as will\r\nutter a brace of words.\r\n\r\n[_Armado and King talk apart._]\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nDoth this man serve God?\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nWhy ask you?\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nHe speaks not like a man of God his making.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nThat is all one, my fair, sweet, honey monarch; for, I protest, the\r\nschoolmaster is exceeding fantastical; too, too vain, too, too vain.\r\nBut we will put it, as they say, to _fortuna de la guerra_. I wish you\r\nthe peace of mind, most royal couplement!\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nHere is like to be a good presence of Worthies. He presents Hector of\r\nTroy; the swain, Pompey the Great; the parish curate, Alexander;\r\nArmado’s page, Hercules; the pedant, Judas Maccabaeus.\r\n_And if these four Worthies in their first show thrive,\r\nThese four will change habits and present the other five._\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nThere is five in the first show.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nYou are deceived. ’Tis not so.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nThe pedant, the braggart, the hedge-priest, the fool, and the boy.\r\nAbate throw at novum, and the whole world again\r\nCannot pick out five such, take each one in his vein.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nThe ship is under sail, and here she comes amain.\r\n\r\nEnter Costard as Pompey.\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\n_I Pompey am_—\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nYou lie, you are not he.\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\n_I Pompey am_—\r\n\r\nBOYET.\r\nWith leopard’s head on knee.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nWell said, old mocker. I must needs be friends with thee.\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\n_I Pompey am, Pompey surnamed the Big._\r\n\r\nDUMAINE.\r\nThe “Great”.\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nIt is “Great”, sir; _Pompey surnamed the Great,\r\nThat oft in field, with targe and shield, did make my foe to sweat.\r\nAnd travelling along this coast, I here am come by chance,\r\nAnd lay my arms before the legs of this sweet lass of France._\r\nIf your ladyship would say, “Thanks, Pompey”, I had done.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nGreat thanks, great Pompey.\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\n’Tis not so much worth; but I hope I was perfect.

Great, great, great Pompey! Pompey the Huge!\r\n\r\nDUMAINE.\r\nHector trembles.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nPompey is moved. More Ates, more Ates! Stir them on, stir them on!\r\n\r\nDUMAINE.\r\nHector will challenge him.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nAy, if he have no more man’s blood in his belly than will sup a flea.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nBy the north pole, I do challenge thee.\r\n\r\nCOSTARD.\r\nI will not fight with a pole, like a northern man.

I go woolward for penance.\r\n\r\nBOYET.\r\nTrue, and it was enjoined him in Rome for want of linen; since when,\r\nI’ll be sworn, he wore none but a dishclout of Jaquenetta’s, and that\r\nhe wears next his heart for a favour.\r\n\r\nEnter a Messenger, Monsieur Marcadé.\r\n\r\nMARCADÉ.\r\nGod save you, madam.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nWelcome, Marcadé,\r\nBut that thou interruptest our merriment.\r\n\r\nMARCADÉ.\r\nI am sorry, madam, for the news I bring\r\nIs heavy in my tongue.

I will away tonight.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nMadam, not so. I do beseech you stay.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nPrepare, I say. I thank you, gracious lords,\r\nFor all your fair endeavours, and entreat,\r\nOut of a new-sad soul, that you vouchsafe\r\nIn your rich wisdom to excuse or hide\r\nThe liberal opposition of our spirits,\r\nIf over-boldly we have borne ourselves\r\nIn the converse of breath; your gentleness\r\nWas guilty of it. Farewell, worthy lord!\r\nA heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue.\r\nExcuse me so, coming too short of thanks\r\nFor my great suit so easily obtained.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nThe extreme parts of time extremely forms\r\nAll causes to the purpose of his speed,\r\nAnd often at his very loose decides\r\nThat which long process could not arbitrate.\r\nAnd though the mourning brow of progeny\r\nForbid the smiling courtesy of love\r\nThe holy suit which fain it would convince,\r\nYet, since love’s argument was first on foot,\r\nLet not the cloud of sorrow jostle it\r\nFrom what it purposed; since to wail friends lost\r\nIs not by much so wholesome-profitable\r\nAs to rejoice at friends but newly found.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nI understand you not. My griefs are double.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nHonest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;\r\nAnd by these badges understand the King.\r\nFor your fair sakes have we neglected time,\r\nPlayed foul play with our oaths. Your beauty, ladies,\r\nHath much deformed us, fashioning our humours\r\nEven to the opposed end of our intents;\r\nAnd what in us hath seemed ridiculous—\r\nAs love is full of unbefitting strains,\r\nAll wanton as a child, skipping and vain,\r\nFormed by the eye and therefore, like the eye,\r\nFull of strange shapes, of habits and of forms,\r\nVarying in subjects as the eye doth roll\r\nTo every varied object in his glance;\r\nWhich parti-coated presence of loose love\r\nPut on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes,\r\nHave misbecomed our oaths and gravities,\r\nThose heavenly eyes that look into these faults\r\nSuggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,\r\nOur love being yours, the error that love makes\r\nIs likewise yours. We to ourselves prove false\r\nBy being once false for ever to be true\r\nTo those that make us both—fair ladies, you.\r\nAnd even that falsehood, in itself a sin,\r\nThus purifies itself and turns to grace.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nWe have received your letters, full of love;\r\nYour favours, the ambassadors of love;\r\nAnd in our maiden council rated them\r\nAt courtship, pleasant jest, and courtesy,\r\nAs bombast and as lining to the time.\r\nBut more devout than this in our respects\r\nHave we not been; and therefore met your loves\r\nIn their own fashion, like a merriment.\r\n\r\nDUMAINE.\r\nOur letters, madam, showed much more than jest.\r\n\r\nLONGAVILLE.\r\nSo did our looks.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nWe did not quote them so.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nNow, at the latest minute of the hour,\r\nGrant us your loves.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nA time, methinks, too short\r\nTo make a world-without-end bargain in.\r\nNo, no, my lord, your Grace is perjured much,\r\nFull of dear guiltiness; and therefore this:\r\nIf for my love—as there is no such cause—\r\nYou will do aught, this shall you do for me:\r\nYour oath I will not trust, but go with speed\r\nTo some forlorn and naked hermitage,\r\nRemote from all the pleasures of the world,\r\nThere stay until the twelve celestial signs\r\nHave brought about the annual reckoning.\r\nIf this austere insociable life\r\nChange not your offer made in heat of blood;\r\nIf frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds,\r\nNip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,\r\nBut that it bear this trial, and last love;\r\nThen, at the expiration of the year,\r\nCome challenge me, challenge me by these deserts,\r\nAnd, by this virgin palm now kissing thine,\r\nI will be thine. And, till that instance, shut\r\nMy woeful self up in a mournful house,\r\nRaining the tears of lamentation\r\nFor the remembrance of my father’s death.\r\nIf this thou do deny, let our hands part,\r\nNeither entitled in the other’s heart.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nIf this, or more than this, I would deny,\r\n To flatter up these powers of mine with rest,\r\nThe sudden hand of death close up mine eye!\r\n Hence hermit, then. My heart is in thy breast.\r\n\r\n[_They converse apart_]\r\n\r\nDUMAINE.\r\nAnd what to me, my love? But what to me?\r\nA wife?\r\n\r\nKATHARINE.\r\nA beard, fair health, and honesty;\r\nWith threefold love I wish you all these three.\r\n\r\nDUMAINE.\r\nO, shall I say, “I thank you, gentle wife”?\r\n\r\nKATHARINE.\r\nNo so, my lord. A twelvemonth and a day\r\nI’ll mark no words that smooth-faced wooers say.\r\nCome when the King doth to my lady come;\r\nThen, if I have much love, I’ll give you some.\r\n\r\nDUMAINE.\r\nI’ll serve thee true and faithfully till then.\r\n\r\nKATHARINE.\r\nYet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.\r\n\r\n[_They converse apart_]\r\n\r\nLONGAVILLE.\r\nWhat says Maria?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nAt the twelvemonth’s end\r\nI’ll change my black gown for a faithful friend.\r\n\r\nLONGAVILLE.\r\nI’ll stay with patience, but the time is long.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nThe liker you; few taller are so young.\r\n\r\n[_They converse apart_]\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nStudies my lady? Mistress, look on me.\r\nBehold the window of my heart, mine eye,\r\nWhat humble suit attends thy answer there.\r\nImpose some service on me for thy love.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nOft have I heard of you, my Lord Berowne,\r\nBefore I saw you; and the world’s large tongue\r\nProclaims you for a man replete with mocks,\r\nFull of comparisons and wounding flouts,\r\nWhich you on all estates will execute\r\nThat lie within the mercy of your wit.\r\nTo weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,\r\nAnd therewithal to win me, if you please,\r\nWithout the which I am not to be won,\r\nYou shall this twelvemonth term from day to day\r\nVisit the speechless sick, and still converse\r\nWith groaning wretches; and your task shall be,\r\nWith all the fierce endeavour of your wit\r\nTo enforce the pained impotent to smile.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nTo move wild laughter in the throat of death?\r\nIt cannot be, it is impossible.\r\nMirth cannot move a soul in agony.\r\n\r\nROSALINE.\r\nWhy, that’s the way to choke a gibing spirit,\r\nWhose influence is begot of that loose grace\r\nWhich shallow laughing hearers give to fools.\r\nA jest’s prosperity lies in the ear\r\nOf him that hears it, never in the tongue\r\nOf him that makes it. Then, if sickly ears,\r\nDeafed with the clamours of their own dear groans,\r\nWill hear your idle scorns, continue then,\r\nAnd I will have you and that fault withal;\r\nBut if they will not, throw away that spirit,\r\nAnd I shall find you empty of that fault,\r\nRight joyful of your reformation.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nA twelvemonth? Well, befall what will befall,\r\nI’ll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital.\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\n[_To the King_.] Ay, sweet my lord, and so I take my leave.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nNo, madam, we will bring you on your way.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nOur wooing doth not end like an old play.\r\nJack hath not Jill. These ladies’ courtesy\r\nMight well have made our sport a comedy.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nCome, sir, it wants a twelvemonth and a day,\r\nAnd then ’twill end.\r\n\r\nBEROWNE.\r\nThat’s too long for a play.\r\n\r\nEnter Armado, the Braggart.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nSweet Majesty, vouchsafe me—\r\n\r\nPRINCESS.\r\nWas not that Hector?\r\n\r\nDUMAINE.\r\nThe worthy knight of Troy.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nI will kiss thy royal finger, and take leave. I am a votary; I have\r\nvowed to Jaquenetta to hold the plough for her sweet love three year.\r\nBut, most esteemed Greatness, will you hear the dialogue that the two\r\nlearned men have compiled in praise of the owl and the cuckoo? It\r\nshould have followed in the end of our show.\r\n\r\nKING.\r\nCall them forth quickly; we will do so.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nHolla! Approach.\r\n\r\nEnter all.\r\n\r\nThis side is _Hiems_, Winter; this _Ver_, the Spring; the one\r\nmaintained by the owl, th’ other by the cuckoo. _Ver_, begin.\r\n\r\nThe Song\r\n\r\nSPRING.\r\nWhen daisies pied and violets blue\r\n And lady-smocks all silver-white\r\nAnd cuckoo-buds of yellow hue\r\n Do paint the meadows with delight,\r\nThe cuckoo then on every tree\r\nMocks married men; for thus sings he:\r\n “Cuckoo!\r\nCuckoo, cuckoo!” O, word of fear,\r\nUnpleasing to a married ear.\r\n\r\nWhen shepherds pipe on oaten straws,\r\n And merry larks are ploughmen’s clocks,\r\nWhen turtles tread, and rooks and daws,\r\n And maidens bleach their summer smocks,\r\nThe cuckoo then, on every tree,\r\nMocks married men, for thus sings he:\r\n “Cuckoo!\r\nCuckoo, cuckoo!” O, word of fear,\r\nUnpleasing to a married ear.\r\n\r\nWINTER.\r\nWhen icicles hang by the wall,\r\n And Dick the shepherd blows his nail,\r\nAnd Tom bears logs into the hall,\r\n And milk comes frozen home in pail,\r\nWhen blood is nipped, and ways be foul,\r\n Then nightly sings the staring owl:\r\n“Tu-whit, Tu-whoo!” A merry note,\r\nWhile greasy Joan doth keel the pot.\r\n\r\nWhen all aloud the wind doth blow,\r\n And coughing drowns the parson’s saw,\r\nAnd birds sit brooding in the snow,\r\n And Marian’s nose looks red and raw,\r\nWhen roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,\r\nThen nightly sings the staring owl:\r\n“Tu-whit, Tu-whoo!” A merry note,\r\nWhile greasy Joan doth keel the pot.\r\n\r\nARMADO.\r\nThe words of Mercury are harsh after the songs of Apollo.\r\nYou that way, we this way.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\nTHE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH\r\n\nContents\r\n\r\nACT I\r\nScene I.

Mark, King of Scotland, mark:\r\nNo sooner justice had, with valour arm’d,\r\nCompell’d these skipping kerns to trust their heels,\r\nBut the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage,\r\nWith furbish’d arms and new supplies of men,\r\nBegan a fresh assault.\r\n\r\nDUNCAN.\r\nDismay’d not this\r\nOur captains, Macbeth and Banquo?\r\n\r\nSOLDIER.\r\nYes;\r\nAs sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.\r\nIf I say sooth, I must report they were\r\nAs cannons overcharg’d with double cracks;\r\nSo they\r\nDoubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:\r\nExcept they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,\r\nOr memorize another Golgotha,\r\nI cannot tell—\r\nBut I am faint, my gashes cry for help.\r\n\r\nDUNCAN.\r\nSo well thy words become thee as thy wounds:\r\nThey smack of honour both.—Go, get him surgeons.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Captain, attended._]\r\n\r\n Enter Ross and Angus.\r\n\r\nWho comes here?\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nThe worthy Thane of Ross.\r\n\r\nLENNOX.\r\nWhat a haste looks through his eyes!

When I\r\nburned in desire to question them further, they made themselves air,\r\ninto which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came\r\nmissives from the King, who all-hailed me, ‘Thane of Cawdor’; by which\r\ntitle, before, these Weird Sisters saluted me, and referred me to the\r\ncoming on of time, with ‘Hail, king that shalt be!’ This have I thought\r\ngood to deliver thee (my dearest partner of greatness) that thou\r\nmight’st not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being ignorant of what\r\ngreatness is promis’d thee. Lay it to thy heart, and farewell.”\r\n\r\nGlamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be\r\nWhat thou art promis’d. Yet do I fear thy nature;\r\nIt is too full o’ th’ milk of human kindness\r\nTo catch the nearest way. Thou wouldst be great;\r\nArt not without ambition, but without\r\nThe illness should attend it. What thou wouldst highly,\r\nThat wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,\r\nAnd yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou’dst have, great Glamis,\r\nThat which cries, “Thus thou must do,” if thou have it;\r\nAnd that which rather thou dost fear to do,\r\nThan wishest should be undone. Hie thee hither,\r\nThat I may pour my spirits in thine ear,\r\nAnd chastise with the valour of my tongue\r\nAll that impedes thee from the golden round,\r\nWhich fate and metaphysical aid doth seem\r\nTo have thee crown’d withal.\r\n\r\n Enter a Messenger.\r\n\r\nWhat is your tidings?\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nThe King comes here tonight.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nThou’rt mad to say it.\r\nIs not thy master with him? who, were’t so,\r\nWould have inform’d for preparation.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nSo please you, it is true.

If th’ assassination\r\nCould trammel up the consequence, and catch\r\nWith his surcease success; that but this blow\r\nMight be the be-all and the end-all—here,\r\nBut here, upon this bank and shoal of time,\r\nWe’d jump the life to come. But in these cases\r\nWe still have judgement here; that we but teach\r\nBloody instructions, which being taught, return\r\nTo plague th’ inventor. This even-handed justice\r\nCommends th’ ingredience of our poison’d chalice\r\nTo our own lips. He’s here in double trust:\r\nFirst, as I am his kinsman and his subject,\r\nStrong both against the deed; then, as his host,\r\nWho should against his murderer shut the door,\r\nNot bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan\r\nHath borne his faculties so meek, hath been\r\nSo clear in his great office, that his virtues\r\nWill plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against\r\nThe deep damnation of his taking-off;\r\nAnd pity, like a naked new-born babe,\r\nStriding the blast, or heaven’s cherubin, hors’d\r\nUpon the sightless couriers of the air,\r\nShall blow the horrid deed in every eye,\r\nThat tears shall drown the wind.—I have no spur\r\nTo prick the sides of my intent, but only\r\nVaulting ambition, which o’erleaps itself\r\nAnd falls on th’ other—\r\n\r\n Enter Lady Macbeth.\r\n\r\nHow now! what news?\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nHe has almost supp’d. Why have you left the chamber?\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nHath he ask’d for me?\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nKnow you not he has?\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nWe will proceed no further in this business:\r\nHe hath honour’d me of late; and I have bought\r\nGolden opinions from all sorts of people,\r\nWhich would be worn now in their newest gloss,\r\nNot cast aside so soon.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nWas the hope drunk\r\nWherein you dress’d yourself? Hath it slept since?\r\nAnd wakes it now, to look so green and pale\r\nAt what it did so freely? From this time\r\nSuch I account thy love. Art thou afeard\r\nTo be the same in thine own act and valour\r\nAs thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that\r\nWhich thou esteem’st the ornament of life,\r\nAnd live a coward in thine own esteem,\r\nLetting “I dare not” wait upon “I would,”\r\nLike the poor cat i’ th’ adage?\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nPr’ythee, peace!\r\nI dare do all that may become a man;\r\nWho dares do more is none.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nWhat beast was’t, then,\r\nThat made you break this enterprise to me?\r\nWhen you durst do it, then you were a man;\r\nAnd, to be more than what you were, you would\r\nBe so much more the man. Nor time nor place\r\nDid then adhere, and yet you would make both:\r\nThey have made themselves, and that their fitness now\r\nDoes unmake you. I have given suck, and know\r\nHow tender ’tis to love the babe that milks me:\r\nI would, while it was smiling in my face,\r\nHave pluck’d my nipple from his boneless gums\r\nAnd dash’d the brains out, had I so sworn as you\r\nHave done to this.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nIf we should fail?\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nWe fail?\r\nBut screw your courage to the sticking-place,\r\nAnd we’ll not fail. When Duncan is asleep\r\n(Whereto the rather shall his day’s hard journey\r\nSoundly invite him), his two chamberlains\r\nWill I with wine and wassail so convince\r\nThat memory, the warder of the brain,\r\nShall be a fume, and the receipt of reason\r\nA limbeck only: when in swinish sleep\r\nTheir drenched natures lie as in a death,\r\nWhat cannot you and I perform upon\r\nTh’ unguarded Duncan? what not put upon\r\nHis spongy officers; who shall bear the guilt\r\nOf our great quell?\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nBring forth men-children only;\r\nFor thy undaunted mettle should compose\r\nNothing but males. Will it not be receiv’d,\r\nWhen we have mark’d with blood those sleepy two\r\nOf his own chamber, and us’d their very daggers,\r\nThat they have done’t?\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nWho dares receive it other,\r\nAs we shall make our griefs and clamour roar\r\nUpon his death?\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nI am settled, and bend up\r\nEach corporal agent to this terrible feat.\r\nAway, and mock the time with fairest show:\r\nFalse face must hide what the false heart doth know.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\nACT II\r\n\r\nSCENE I.

The King’s abed:\r\nHe hath been in unusual pleasure and\r\nSent forth great largess to your offices.\r\nThis diamond he greets your wife withal,\r\nBy the name of most kind hostess, and shut up\r\nIn measureless content.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nBeing unprepar’d,\r\nOur will became the servant to defect,\r\nWhich else should free have wrought.\r\n\r\nBANQUO.\r\nAll’s well.\r\nI dreamt last night of the three Weird Sisters:\r\nTo you they have show’d some truth.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nI think not of them:\r\nYet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,\r\nWe would spend it in some words upon that business,\r\nIf you would grant the time.\r\n\r\nBANQUO.\r\nAt your kind’st leisure.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nIf you shall cleave to my consent, when ’tis,\r\nIt shall make honour for you.\r\n\r\nBANQUO.\r\nSo I lose none\r\nIn seeking to augment it, but still keep\r\nMy bosom franchis’d, and allegiance clear,\r\nI shall be counsell’d.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nGood repose the while!\r\n\r\nBANQUO.\r\nThanks, sir: the like to you.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Banquo and Fleance._]\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nGo bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,\r\nShe strike upon the bell.

Come, let me clutch thee:—\r\nI have thee not, and yet I see thee still.\r\nArt thou not, fatal vision, sensible\r\nTo feeling as to sight? or art thou but\r\nA dagger of the mind, a false creation,\r\nProceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?\r\nI see thee yet, in form as palpable\r\nAs this which now I draw.\r\nThou marshall’st me the way that I was going;\r\nAnd such an instrument I was to use.\r\nMine eyes are made the fools o’ the other senses,\r\nOr else worth all the rest: I see thee still;\r\nAnd on thy blade and dudgeon, gouts of blood,\r\nWhich was not so before.—There’s no such thing.\r\nIt is the bloody business which informs\r\nThus to mine eyes.—Now o’er the one half-world\r\nNature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse\r\nThe curtain’d sleep. Witchcraft celebrates\r\nPale Hecate’s off’rings; and wither’d murder,\r\nAlarum’d by his sentinel, the wolf,\r\nWhose howl’s his watch, thus with his stealthy pace,\r\nWith Tarquin’s ravishing strides, towards his design\r\nMoves like a ghost.—Thou sure and firm-set earth,\r\nHear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear\r\nThy very stones prate of my whereabout,\r\nAnd take the present horror from the time,\r\nWhich now suits with it.—Whiles I threat, he lives.\r\nWords to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.\r\n\r\n [_A bell rings._]\r\n\r\nI go, and it is done.

He is about it.\r\nThe doors are open; and the surfeited grooms\r\nDo mock their charge with snores: I have drugg’d their possets,\r\nThat death and nature do contend about them,\r\nWhether they live or die.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\n[_Within._] Who’s there?—what, ho!\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nAlack! I am afraid they have awak’d,\r\nAnd ’tis not done.

Macbeth shall sleep no more!”\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nWho was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,\r\nYou do unbend your noble strength to think\r\nSo brainsickly of things. Go get some water,\r\nAnd wash this filthy witness from your hand.—\r\nWhy did you bring these daggers from the place?\r\nThey must lie there: go carry them, and smear\r\nThe sleepy grooms with blood.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nI’ll go no more:\r\nI am afraid to think what I have done;\r\nLook on’t again I dare not.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nInfirm of purpose!\r\nGive me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead\r\nAre but as pictures. ’Tis the eye of childhood\r\nThat fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,\r\nI’ll gild the faces of the grooms withal,\r\nFor it must seem their guilt.\r\n\r\n [_Exit.

No, this my hand will rather\r\nThe multitudinous seas incarnadine,\r\nMaking the green one red.\r\n\r\n Enter Lady Macbeth.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nMy hands are of your color, but I shame\r\nTo wear a heart so white.

Here’s a farmer that hanged himself on\r\nthe expectation of plenty: come in time; have napkins enow about you;\r\nhere you’ll sweat for’t. [_Knocking._] Knock, knock! Who’s there, i’\r\nth’ other devil’s name? Faith, here’s an equivocator, that could swear\r\nin both the scales against either scale, who committed treason enough\r\nfor God’s sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come in,\r\nequivocator. [_Knocking._] Knock, knock, knock! Who’s there? Faith,\r\nhere’s an English tailor come hither, for stealing out of a French\r\nhose: come in, tailor; here you may roast your goose. [_Knocking._]\r\nKnock, knock. Never at quiet! What are you?—But this place is too cold\r\nfor hell. I’ll devil-porter it no further: I had thought to have let in\r\nsome of all professions, that go the primrose way to th’ everlasting\r\nbonfire. [_Knocking._] Anon, anon!

Lechery, sir, it provokes\r\nand unprovokes; it provokes the desire, but it takes away the\r\nperformance. Therefore much drink may be said to be an equivocator with\r\nlechery: it makes him, and it mars him; it sets him on, and it takes\r\nhim off; it persuades him, and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and\r\nnot stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and giving him\r\nthe lie, leaves him.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nI believe drink gave thee the lie last night.\r\n\r\nPORTER.\r\nThat it did, sir, i’ the very throat on me; but I requited him for his\r\nlie; and (I think) being too strong for him, though he took up my legs\r\nsometime, yet I made a shift to cast him.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nIs thy master stirring?\r\n\r\n Enter Macbeth.\r\n\r\nOur knocking has awak’d him; here he comes.\r\n\r\nLENNOX.\r\nGood morrow, noble sir!\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nGood morrow, both!\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nIs the King stirring, worthy thane?\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nNot yet.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nHe did command me to call timely on him.\r\nI have almost slipp’d the hour.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nI’ll bring you to him.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nI know this is a joyful trouble to you;\r\nBut yet ’tis one.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nThe labour we delight in physics pain.\r\nThis is the door.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nI’ll make so bold to call.\r\nFor ’tis my limited service.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Macduff._]\r\n\r\nLENNOX.\r\nGoes the King hence today?\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nHe does. He did appoint so.\r\n\r\nLENNOX.\r\nThe night has been unruly: where we lay,\r\nOur chimneys were blown down and, as they say,\r\nLamentings heard i’ th’ air, strange screams of death,\r\nAnd prophesying, with accents terrible,\r\nOf dire combustion and confus’d events,\r\nNew hatch’d to the woeful time. The obscure bird\r\nClamour’d the live-long night. Some say the earth\r\nWas feverous, and did shake.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\n’Twas a rough night.\r\n\r\nLENNOX.\r\nMy young remembrance cannot parallel\r\nA fellow to it.\r\n\r\n Enter Macduff.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nO horror, horror, horror!\r\nTongue nor heart cannot conceive nor name thee!\r\n\r\nMACBETH, LENNOX.\r\nWhat’s the matter?\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nConfusion now hath made his masterpiece!\r\nMost sacrilegious murder hath broke ope\r\nThe Lord’s anointed temple, and stole thence\r\nThe life o’ th’ building.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nWhat is’t you say? the life?\r\n\r\nLENNOX.\r\nMean you his majesty?\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nApproach the chamber, and destroy your sight\r\nWith a new Gorgon. Do not bid me speak.\r\nSee, and then speak yourselves.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Macbeth and Lennox._]\r\n\r\nAwake, awake!—\r\nRing the alarum bell.—Murder and treason!\r\nBanquo and Donalbain!

They star’d, and were distracted;\r\nNo man’s life was to be trusted with them.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nO, yet I do repent me of my fury,\r\nThat I did kill them.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nWherefore did you so?\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nWho can be wise, amaz’d, temperate, and furious,\r\nLoyal and neutral, in a moment? No man:\r\nTh’ expedition of my violent love\r\nOutrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,\r\nHis silver skin lac’d with his golden blood;\r\nAnd his gash’d stabs look’d like a breach in nature\r\nFor ruin’s wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,\r\nSteep’d in the colours of their trade, their daggers\r\nUnmannerly breech’d with gore. Who could refrain,\r\nThat had a heart to love, and in that heart\r\nCourage to make’s love known?\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nHelp me hence, ho!\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nLook to the lady.\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nWhy do we hold our tongues,\r\nThat most may claim this argument for ours?\r\n\r\nDONALBAIN.\r\nWhat should be spoken here, where our fate,\r\nHid in an auger hole, may rush, and seize us?\r\nLet’s away. Our tears are not yet brew’d.\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nNor our strong sorrow\r\nUpon the foot of motion.\r\n\r\nBANQUO.\r\nLook to the lady:—\r\n\r\n [_Lady Macbeth is carried out._]\r\n\r\nAnd when we have our naked frailties hid,\r\nThat suffer in exposure, let us meet,\r\nAnd question this most bloody piece of work\r\nTo know it further.

Let’s not consort with them:\r\nTo show an unfelt sorrow is an office\r\nWhich the false man does easy. I’ll to England.\r\n\r\nDONALBAIN.\r\nTo Ireland, I. Our separated fortune\r\nShall keep us both the safer. Where we are,\r\nThere’s daggers in men’s smiles: the near in blood,\r\nThe nearer bloody.\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nThis murderous shaft that’s shot\r\nHath not yet lighted; and our safest way\r\nIs to avoid the aim.

Our fears in Banquo\r\nStick deep, and in his royalty of nature\r\nReigns that which would be fear’d: ’tis much he dares;\r\nAnd, to that dauntless temper of his mind,\r\nHe hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour\r\nTo act in safety. There is none but he\r\nWhose being I do fear: and under him\r\nMy genius is rebuk’d; as, it is said,\r\nMark Antony’s was by Caesar. He chid the sisters\r\nWhen first they put the name of king upon me,\r\nAnd bade them speak to him; then, prophet-like,\r\nThey hail’d him father to a line of kings:\r\nUpon my head they plac’d a fruitless crown,\r\nAnd put a barren sceptre in my gripe,\r\nThence to be wrench’d with an unlineal hand,\r\nNo son of mine succeeding. If’t be so,\r\nFor Banquo’s issue have I fil’d my mind;\r\nFor them the gracious Duncan have I murder’d;\r\nPut rancours in the vessel of my peace\r\nOnly for them; and mine eternal jewel\r\nGiven to the common enemy of man,\r\nTo make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!\r\nRather than so, come, fate, into the list,\r\nAnd champion me to th’ utterance!—Who’s there?—\r\n\r\n Enter Servant with two Murderers.\r\n\r\nNow go to the door, and stay there till we call.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Servant._]\r\n\r\nWas it not yesterday we spoke together?\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nIt was, so please your Highness.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nWell then, now\r\nHave you consider’d of my speeches? Know\r\nThat it was he, in the times past, which held you\r\nSo under fortune, which you thought had been\r\nOur innocent self? This I made good to you\r\nIn our last conference, pass’d in probation with you\r\nHow you were borne in hand, how cross’d, the instruments,\r\nWho wrought with them, and all things else that might\r\nTo half a soul and to a notion craz’d\r\nSay, “Thus did Banquo.”\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nYou made it known to us.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nI did so; and went further, which is now\r\nOur point of second meeting. Do you find\r\nYour patience so predominant in your nature,\r\nThat you can let this go? Are you so gospell’d,\r\nTo pray for this good man and for his issue,\r\nWhose heavy hand hath bow’d you to the grave,\r\nAnd beggar’d yours forever?\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nWe are men, my liege.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nAy, in the catalogue ye go for men;\r\nAs hounds, and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,\r\nShoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves are clept\r\nAll by the name of dogs: the valu’d file\r\nDistinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,\r\nThe housekeeper, the hunter, every one\r\nAccording to the gift which bounteous nature\r\nHath in him clos’d; whereby he does receive\r\nParticular addition, from the bill\r\nThat writes them all alike: and so of men.\r\nNow, if you have a station in the file,\r\nNot i’ th’ worst rank of manhood, say’t;\r\nAnd I will put that business in your bosoms,\r\nWhose execution takes your enemy off,\r\nGrapples you to the heart and love of us,\r\nWho wear our health but sickly in his life,\r\nWhich in his death were perfect.\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\nI am one, my liege,\r\nWhom the vile blows and buffets of the world\r\nHath so incens’d that I am reckless what\r\nI do to spite the world.\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nAnd I another,\r\nSo weary with disasters, tugg’d with fortune,\r\nThat I would set my life on any chance,\r\nTo mend it or be rid on’t.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nBoth of you\r\nKnow Banquo was your enemy.\r\n\r\nBOTH MURDERERS.\r\nTrue, my lord.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nSo is he mine; and in such bloody distance,\r\nThat every minute of his being thrusts\r\nAgainst my near’st of life; and though I could\r\nWith barefac’d power sweep him from my sight,\r\nAnd bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,\r\nFor certain friends that are both his and mine,\r\nWhose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall\r\nWho I myself struck down: and thence it is\r\nThat I to your assistance do make love,\r\nMasking the business from the common eye\r\nFor sundry weighty reasons.\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\nWe shall, my lord,\r\nPerform what you command us.\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nThough our lives—\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nYour spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most,\r\nI will advise you where to plant yourselves,\r\nAcquaint you with the perfect spy o’ th’ time,\r\nThe moment on’t; for’t must be done tonight\r\nAnd something from the palace; always thought\r\nThat I require a clearness. And with him\r\n(To leave no rubs nor botches in the work)\r\nFleance his son, that keeps him company,\r\nWhose absence is no less material to me\r\nThan is his father’s, must embrace the fate\r\nOf that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart.\r\nI’ll come to you anon.\r\n\r\nBOTH MURDERERS.\r\nWe are resolv’d, my lord.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nI’ll call upon you straight: abide within.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Murderers._]\r\n\r\nIt is concluded. Banquo, thy soul’s flight,\r\nIf it find heaven, must find it out tonight.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. The same. Another Room in the Palace.\r\n\r\n Enter Lady Macbeth and a Servant.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nIs Banquo gone from court?\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nAy, madam, but returns again tonight.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nSay to the King, I would attend his leisure\r\nFor a few words.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nMadam, I will.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nNaught’s had, all’s spent,\r\nWhere our desire is got without content:\r\n’Tis safer to be that which we destroy,\r\nThan by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.\r\n\r\n Enter Macbeth.\r\n\r\nHow now, my lord, why do you keep alone,\r\nOf sorriest fancies your companions making,\r\nUsing those thoughts which should indeed have died\r\nWith them they think on? Things without all remedy\r\nShould be without regard: what’s done is done.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nWe have scorch’d the snake, not kill’d it.\r\nShe’ll close, and be herself; whilst our poor malice\r\nRemains in danger of her former tooth.\r\nBut let the frame of things disjoint,\r\nBoth the worlds suffer,\r\nEre we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep\r\nIn the affliction of these terrible dreams\r\nThat shake us nightly. Better be with the dead,\r\nWhom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,\r\nThan on the torture of the mind to lie\r\nIn restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;\r\nAfter life’s fitful fever he sleeps well;\r\nTreason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,\r\nMalice domestic, foreign levy, nothing\r\nCan touch him further.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nCome on,\r\nGently my lord, sleek o’er your rugged looks;\r\nBe bright and jovial among your guests tonight.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nSo shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you.\r\nLet your remembrance apply to Banquo;\r\nPresent him eminence, both with eye and tongue:\r\nUnsafe the while, that we\r\nMust lave our honours in these flattering streams,\r\nAnd make our faces vizards to our hearts,\r\nDisguising what they are.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nYou must leave this.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nO, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!\r\nThou know’st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nBut in them nature’s copy’s not eterne.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nThere’s comfort yet; they are assailable.\r\nThen be thou jocund. Ere the bat hath flown\r\nHis cloister’d flight, ere to black Hecate’s summons\r\nThe shard-born beetle, with his drowsy hums,\r\nHath rung night’s yawning peal, there shall be done\r\nA deed of dreadful note.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nWhat’s to be done?\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nBe innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,\r\nTill thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,\r\nScarf up the tender eye of pitiful day,\r\nAnd with thy bloody and invisible hand\r\nCancel and tear to pieces that great bond\r\nWhich keeps me pale!—Light thickens; and the crow\r\nMakes wing to th’ rooky wood.\r\nGood things of day begin to droop and drowse,\r\nWhiles night’s black agents to their preys do rouse.\r\nThou marvell’st at my words: but hold thee still;\r\nThings bad begun make strong themselves by ill.\r\nSo, pr’ythee, go with me.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. The same. A Park or Lawn, with a gate leading to the Palace.\r\n\r\n Enter three Murderers.\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nBut who did bid thee join with us?\r\n\r\nTHIRD MURDERER.\r\nMacbeth.\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\nHe needs not our mistrust; since he delivers\r\nOur offices and what we have to do\r\nTo the direction just.\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nThen stand with us.\r\nThe west yet glimmers with some streaks of day.\r\nNow spurs the lated traveller apace,\r\nTo gain the timely inn; and near approaches\r\nThe subject of our watch.\r\n\r\nTHIRD MURDERER.\r\nHark! I hear horses.\r\n\r\nBANQUO.\r\n[_Within._] Give us a light there, ho!\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\nThen ’tis he; the rest\r\nThat are within the note of expectation\r\nAlready are i’ th’ court.\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nHis horses go about.\r\n\r\nTHIRD MURDERER.\r\nAlmost a mile; but he does usually,\r\nSo all men do, from hence to the palace gate\r\nMake it their walk.\r\n\r\n Enter Banquo and Fleance with a torch.\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\nA light, a light!\r\n\r\nTHIRD MURDERER.\r\n’Tis he.\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nStand to’t.\r\n\r\nBANQUO.\r\nIt will be rain tonight.\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nLet it come down.\r\n\r\n [_Assaults Banquo._]\r\n\r\nBANQUO.\r\nO, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!\r\nThou mayst revenge—O slave!\r\n\r\n [_Dies.

The same. A Room of state in the Palace.\r\n\r\n A banquet prepared. Enter Macbeth, Lady Macbeth, Ross, Lennox, Lords\r\n and Attendants.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nYou know your own degrees, sit down. At first\r\nAnd last the hearty welcome.\r\n\r\nLORDS.\r\nThanks to your Majesty.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nOurself will mingle with society,\r\nAnd play the humble host.\r\nOur hostess keeps her state; but, in best time,\r\nWe will require her welcome.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nPronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends;\r\nFor my heart speaks they are welcome.\r\n\r\n Enter first Murderer to the door.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nSee, they encounter thee with their hearts’ thanks.\r\nBoth sides are even: here I’ll sit i’ th’ midst.\r\n\r\nBe large in mirth; anon we’ll drink a measure\r\nThe table round. There’s blood upon thy face.\r\n\r\nMURDERER.\r\n’Tis Banquo’s then.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\n’Tis better thee without than he within.\r\nIs he dispatch’d?\r\n\r\nMURDERER.\r\nMy lord, his throat is cut. That I did for him.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nThou art the best o’ th’ cut-throats;\r\nYet he’s good that did the like for Fleance:\r\nIf thou didst it, thou art the nonpareil.\r\n\r\nMURDERER.\r\nMost royal sir,\r\nFleance is ’scap’d.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nThen comes my fit again: I had else been perfect;\r\nWhole as the marble, founded as the rock,\r\nAs broad and general as the casing air:\r\nBut now I am cabin’d, cribb’d, confin’d, bound in\r\nTo saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo’s safe?\r\n\r\nMURDERER.\r\nAy, my good lord. Safe in a ditch he bides,\r\nWith twenty trenched gashes on his head;\r\nThe least a death to nature.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nThanks for that.\r\nThere the grown serpent lies; the worm that’s fled\r\nHath nature that in time will venom breed,\r\nNo teeth for th’ present.—Get thee gone; tomorrow\r\nWe’ll hear, ourselves, again.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Murderer._]\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nMy royal lord,\r\nYou do not give the cheer: the feast is sold\r\nThat is not often vouch’d, while ’tis a-making,\r\n’Tis given with welcome. To feed were best at home;\r\nFrom thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;\r\nMeeting were bare without it.\r\n\r\n The Ghost of Banquo rises, and sits in Macbeth’s place.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nSweet remembrancer!—\r\nNow, good digestion wait on appetite,\r\nAnd health on both!\r\n\r\nLENNOX.\r\nMay’t please your Highness sit.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nHere had we now our country’s honour roof’d,\r\nWere the grac’d person of our Banquo present;\r\nWho may I rather challenge for unkindness\r\nThan pity for mischance!\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nHis absence, sir,\r\nLays blame upon his promise. Please’t your Highness\r\nTo grace us with your royal company?\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nThe table’s full.\r\n\r\nLENNOX.\r\nHere is a place reserv’d, sir.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nWhere?\r\n\r\nLENNOX.\r\nHere, my good lord. What is’t that moves your Highness?\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nWhich of you have done this?\r\n\r\nLORDS.\r\nWhat, my good lord?\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nThou canst not say I did it. Never shake\r\nThy gory locks at me.\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nGentlemen, rise; his Highness is not well.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nSit, worthy friends. My lord is often thus,\r\nAnd hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat;\r\nThe fit is momentary; upon a thought\r\nHe will again be well. If much you note him,\r\nYou shall offend him, and extend his passion.\r\nFeed, and regard him not.—Are you a man?\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nAy, and a bold one, that dare look on that\r\nWhich might appal the devil.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nO proper stuff!\r\nThis is the very painting of your fear:\r\nThis is the air-drawn dagger which you said,\r\nLed you to Duncan. O, these flaws, and starts\r\n(Impostors to true fear), would well become\r\nA woman’s story at a winter’s fire,\r\nAuthoris’d by her grandam. Shame itself!\r\nWhy do you make such faces? When all’s done,\r\nYou look but on a stool.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nPr’ythee, see there!\r\nBehold! look! lo! how say you?\r\nWhy, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.—\r\nIf charnel houses and our graves must send\r\nThose that we bury back, our monuments\r\nShall be the maws of kites.\r\n\r\n [_Ghost disappears._]\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nWhat, quite unmann’d in folly?\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nIf I stand here, I saw him.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nFie, for shame!\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nBlood hath been shed ere now, i’ th’ olden time,\r\nEre humane statute purg’d the gentle weal;\r\nAy, and since too, murders have been perform’d\r\nToo terrible for the ear: the time has been,\r\nThat, when the brains were out, the man would die,\r\nAnd there an end; but now they rise again,\r\nWith twenty mortal murders on their crowns,\r\nAnd push us from our stools. This is more strange\r\nThan such a murder is.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nMy worthy lord,\r\nYour noble friends do lack you.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nI do forget.—\r\nDo not muse at me, my most worthy friends.\r\nI have a strange infirmity, which is nothing\r\nTo those that know me. Come, love and health to all;\r\nThen I’ll sit down.—Give me some wine, fill full.—\r\nI drink to the general joy o’ th’ whole table,\r\nAnd to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss:\r\nWould he were here.\r\n\r\n Ghost rises again.\r\n\r\nTo all, and him, we thirst,\r\nAnd all to all.\r\n\r\nLORDS.\r\nOur duties, and the pledge.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nAvaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!\r\nThy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;\r\nThou hast no speculation in those eyes\r\nWhich thou dost glare with!\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nThink of this, good peers,\r\nBut as a thing of custom: ’tis no other,\r\nOnly it spoils the pleasure of the time.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nWhat man dare, I dare:\r\nApproach thou like the rugged Russian bear,\r\nThe arm’d rhinoceros, or th’ Hyrcan tiger;\r\nTake any shape but that, and my firm nerves\r\nShall never tremble: or be alive again,\r\nAnd dare me to the desert with thy sword;\r\nIf trembling I inhabit then, protest me\r\nThe baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!\r\nUnreal mock’ry, hence!\r\n\r\n [_Ghost disappears._]\r\n\r\nWhy, so;—being gone,\r\nI am a man again.—Pray you, sit still.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nYou have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting\r\nWith most admir’d disorder.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nCan such things be,\r\nAnd overcome us like a summer’s cloud,\r\nWithout our special wonder? You make me strange\r\nEven to the disposition that I owe,\r\nWhen now I think you can behold such sights,\r\nAnd keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,\r\nWhen mine are blanch’d with fear.\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nWhat sights, my lord?\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nI pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;\r\nQuestion enrages him. At once, good night:—\r\nStand not upon the order of your going,\r\nBut go at once.\r\n\r\nLENNOX.\r\nGood night; and better health\r\nAttend his Majesty!\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nA kind good night to all!\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt all Lords and Attendants._]\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nIt will have blood, they say, blood will have blood.\r\nStones have been known to move, and trees to speak;\r\nAugurs, and understood relations, have\r\nBy magot-pies, and choughs, and rooks, brought forth\r\nThe secret’st man of blood.—What is the night?\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nAlmost at odds with morning, which is which.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nHow say’st thou, that Macduff denies his person\r\nAt our great bidding?\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nDid you send to him, sir?\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nI hear it by the way; but I will send.\r\nThere’s not a one of them but in his house\r\nI keep a servant fee’d. I will tomorrow\r\n(And betimes I will) to the Weird Sisters:\r\nMore shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,\r\nBy the worst means, the worst. For mine own good,\r\nAll causes shall give way: I am in blood\r\nStepp’d in so far that, should I wade no more,\r\nReturning were as tedious as go o’er.\r\nStrange things I have in head, that will to hand,\r\nWhich must be acted ere they may be scann’d.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nYou lack the season of all natures, sleep.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nCome, we’ll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse\r\nIs the initiate fear that wants hard use.\r\nWe are yet but young in deed.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE V. The heath.\r\n\r\n Thunder. Enter the three Witches meeting Hecate.\r\n\r\nFIRST WITCH.\r\nWhy, how now, Hecate? you look angerly.\r\n\r\nHECATE.\r\nHave I not reason, beldams as you are,\r\nSaucy and overbold? How did you dare\r\nTo trade and traffic with Macbeth\r\nIn riddles and affairs of death;\r\nAnd I, the mistress of your charms,\r\nThe close contriver of all harms,\r\nWas never call’d to bear my part,\r\nOr show the glory of our art?\r\nAnd, which is worse, all you have done\r\nHath been but for a wayward son,\r\nSpiteful and wrathful; who, as others do,\r\nLoves for his own ends, not for you.\r\nBut make amends now: get you gone,\r\nAnd at the pit of Acheron\r\nMeet me i’ th’ morning: thither he\r\nWill come to know his destiny.\r\nYour vessels and your spells provide,\r\nYour charms, and everything beside.\r\nI am for th’ air; this night I’ll spend\r\nUnto a dismal and a fatal end.\r\nGreat business must be wrought ere noon.\r\nUpon the corner of the moon\r\nThere hangs a vap’rous drop profound;\r\nI’ll catch it ere it come to ground:\r\nAnd that, distill’d by magic sleights,\r\nShall raise such artificial sprites,\r\nAs, by the strength of their illusion,\r\nShall draw him on to his confusion.\r\nHe shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear\r\nHis hopes ’bove wisdom, grace, and fear.\r\nAnd you all know, security\r\nIs mortals’ chiefest enemy.\r\n\r\n [_Music and song within, “Come away, come away” &c._]\r\n\r\nHark!

Forres. A Room in the Palace.\r\n\r\n Enter Lennox and another Lord.\r\n\r\nLENNOX.\r\nMy former speeches have but hit your thoughts,\r\nWhich can interpret farther: only, I say,\r\nThing’s have been strangely borne. The gracious Duncan\r\nWas pitied of Macbeth:—marry, he was dead:—\r\nAnd the right valiant Banquo walk’d too late;\r\nWhom, you may say, if’t please you, Fleance kill’d,\r\nFor Fleance fled. Men must not walk too late.\r\nWho cannot want the thought, how monstrous\r\nIt was for Malcolm and for Donalbain\r\nTo kill their gracious father? damned fact!\r\nHow it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight,\r\nIn pious rage, the two delinquents tear\r\nThat were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?\r\nWas not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;\r\nFor ’twould have anger’d any heart alive,\r\nTo hear the men deny’t. So that, I say,\r\nHe has borne all things well: and I do think,\r\nThat had he Duncan’s sons under his key\r\n(As, and’t please heaven, he shall not) they should find\r\nWhat ’twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.\r\nBut, peace!—for from broad words, and ’cause he fail’d\r\nHis presence at the tyrant’s feast, I hear,\r\nMacduff lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tell\r\nWhere he bestows himself?\r\n\r\nLORD.\r\nThe son of Duncan,\r\nFrom whom this tyrant holds the due of birth,\r\nLives in the English court and is receiv’d\r\nOf the most pious Edward with such grace\r\nThat the malevolence of fortune nothing\r\nTakes from his high respect. Thither Macduff\r\nIs gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid\r\nTo wake Northumberland, and warlike Siward\r\nThat, by the help of these (with Him above\r\nTo ratify the work), we may again\r\nGive to our tables meat, sleep to our nights;\r\nFree from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,\r\nDo faithful homage, and receive free honours,\r\nAll which we pine for now. And this report\r\nHath so exasperate the King that he\r\nPrepares for some attempt of war.\r\n\r\nLENNOX.\r\nSent he to Macduff?\r\n\r\nLORD.\r\nHe did: and with an absolute “Sir, not I,”\r\nThe cloudy messenger turns me his back,\r\nAnd hums, as who should say, “You’ll rue the time\r\nThat clogs me with this answer.”\r\n\r\nLENNOX.\r\nAnd that well might\r\nAdvise him to a caution, t’ hold what distance\r\nHis wisdom can provide.

He loves us not:\r\nHe wants the natural touch; for the poor wren,\r\nThe most diminutive of birds, will fight,\r\nHer young ones in her nest, against the owl.\r\nAll is the fear, and nothing is the love;\r\nAs little is the wisdom, where the flight\r\nSo runs against all reason.\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nMy dearest coz,\r\nI pray you, school yourself: but, for your husband,\r\nHe is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows\r\nThe fits o’ th’ season. I dare not speak much further:\r\nBut cruel are the times, when we are traitors,\r\nAnd do not know ourselves; when we hold rumour\r\nFrom what we fear, yet know not what we fear,\r\nBut float upon a wild and violent sea\r\nEach way and move—I take my leave of you:\r\nShall not be long but I’ll be here again.\r\nThings at the worst will cease, or else climb upward\r\nTo what they were before.—My pretty cousin,\r\nBlessing upon you!\r\n\r\nLADY MACDUFF.\r\nFather’d he is, and yet he’s fatherless.\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nI am so much a fool, should I stay longer,\r\nIt would be my disgrace and your discomfort:\r\nI take my leave at once.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nLADY MACDUFF.\r\nSirrah, your father’s dead.\r\nAnd what will you do now?

But how wilt thou do for a father?\r\n\r\nSON.\r\nIf he were dead, you’ld weep for him: if you would not, it were a good\r\nsign that I should quickly have a new father.\r\n\r\nLADY MACDUFF.\r\nPoor prattler, how thou talk’st!\r\n\r\n Enter a Messenger.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nBless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,\r\nThough in your state of honour I am perfect.\r\nI doubt some danger does approach you nearly:\r\nIf you will take a homely man’s advice,\r\nBe not found here; hence, with your little ones.\r\nTo fright you thus, methinks, I am too savage;\r\nTo do worse to you were fell cruelty,\r\nWhich is too nigh your person.

Before the King’s Palace.\r\n\r\n Enter Malcolm and Macduff.\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nLet us seek out some desolate shade and there\r\nWeep our sad bosoms empty.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nLet us rather\r\nHold fast the mortal sword, and, like good men,\r\nBestride our down-fall’n birthdom. Each new morn\r\nNew widows howl, new orphans cry; new sorrows\r\nStrike heaven on the face, that it resounds\r\nAs if it felt with Scotland, and yell’d out\r\nLike syllable of dolour.\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nWhat I believe, I’ll wail;\r\nWhat know, believe; and what I can redress,\r\nAs I shall find the time to friend, I will.\r\nWhat you have spoke, it may be so, perchance.\r\nThis tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,\r\nWas once thought honest: you have loved him well;\r\nHe hath not touch’d you yet. I am young; but something\r\nYou may deserve of him through me; and wisdom\r\nTo offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb\r\nTo appease an angry god.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nI am not treacherous.\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nBut Macbeth is.\r\nA good and virtuous nature may recoil\r\nIn an imperial charge. But I shall crave your pardon.\r\nThat which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose.\r\nAngels are bright still, though the brightest fell:\r\nThough all things foul would wear the brows of grace,\r\nYet grace must still look so.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nI have lost my hopes.\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nPerchance even there where I did find my doubts.\r\nWhy in that rawness left you wife and child,\r\nThose precious motives, those strong knots of love,\r\nWithout leave-taking?—I pray you,\r\nLet not my jealousies be your dishonours,\r\nBut mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,\r\nWhatever I shall think.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nBleed, bleed, poor country!\r\nGreat tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure,\r\nFor goodness dare not check thee! wear thou thy wrongs;\r\nThe title is affeer’d.—Fare thee well, lord:\r\nI would not be the villain that thou think’st\r\nFor the whole space that’s in the tyrant’s grasp\r\nAnd the rich East to boot.\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nBe not offended:\r\nI speak not as in absolute fear of you.\r\nI think our country sinks beneath the yoke;\r\nIt weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash\r\nIs added to her wounds. I think, withal,\r\nThere would be hands uplifted in my right;\r\nAnd here, from gracious England, have I offer\r\nOf goodly thousands: but, for all this,\r\nWhen I shall tread upon the tyrant’s head,\r\nOr wear it on my sword, yet my poor country\r\nShall have more vices than it had before,\r\nMore suffer, and more sundry ways than ever,\r\nBy him that shall succeed.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nWhat should he be?\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nIt is myself I mean; in whom I know\r\nAll the particulars of vice so grafted\r\nThat, when they shall be open’d, black Macbeth\r\nWill seem as pure as snow; and the poor state\r\nEsteem him as a lamb, being compar’d\r\nWith my confineless harms.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nNot in the legions\r\nOf horrid hell can come a devil more damn’d\r\nIn evils to top Macbeth.\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nI grant him bloody,\r\nLuxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,\r\nSudden, malicious, smacking of every sin\r\nThat has a name: but there’s no bottom, none,\r\nIn my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,\r\nYour matrons, and your maids, could not fill up\r\nThe cistern of my lust; and my desire\r\nAll continent impediments would o’erbear,\r\nThat did oppose my will: better Macbeth\r\nThan such an one to reign.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nBoundless intemperance\r\nIn nature is a tyranny; it hath been\r\nTh’ untimely emptying of the happy throne,\r\nAnd fall of many kings. But fear not yet\r\nTo take upon you what is yours: you may\r\nConvey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,\r\nAnd yet seem cold—the time you may so hoodwink.\r\nWe have willing dames enough; there cannot be\r\nThat vulture in you, to devour so many\r\nAs will to greatness dedicate themselves,\r\nFinding it so inclin’d.\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nWith this there grows\r\nIn my most ill-compos’d affection such\r\nA staunchless avarice, that, were I king,\r\nI should cut off the nobles for their lands;\r\nDesire his jewels, and this other’s house:\r\nAnd my more-having would be as a sauce\r\nTo make me hunger more; that I should forge\r\nQuarrels unjust against the good and loyal,\r\nDestroying them for wealth.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nThis avarice\r\nSticks deeper; grows with more pernicious root\r\nThan summer-seeming lust; and it hath been\r\nThe sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;\r\nScotland hath foisons to fill up your will,\r\nOf your mere own. All these are portable,\r\nWith other graces weigh’d.\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nBut I have none: the king-becoming graces,\r\nAs justice, verity, temp’rance, stableness,\r\nBounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,\r\nDevotion, patience, courage, fortitude,\r\nI have no relish of them; but abound\r\nIn the division of each several crime,\r\nActing it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should\r\nPour the sweet milk of concord into hell,\r\nUproar the universal peace, confound\r\nAll unity on earth.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nO Scotland, Scotland!\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nIf such a one be fit to govern, speak:\r\nI am as I have spoken.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nFit to govern?\r\nNo, not to live.—O nation miserable,\r\nWith an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter’d,\r\nWhen shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,\r\nSince that the truest issue of thy throne\r\nBy his own interdiction stands accus’d,\r\nAnd does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father\r\nWas a most sainted king. The queen that bore thee,\r\nOft’ner upon her knees than on her feet,\r\nDied every day she lived. Fare thee well!\r\nThese evils thou repeat’st upon thyself\r\nHave banish’d me from Scotland.—O my breast,\r\nThy hope ends here!\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nMacduff, this noble passion,\r\nChild of integrity, hath from my soul\r\nWiped the black scruples, reconcil’d my thoughts\r\nTo thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth\r\nBy many of these trains hath sought to win me\r\nInto his power, and modest wisdom plucks me\r\nFrom over-credulous haste: but God above\r\nDeal between thee and me! for even now\r\nI put myself to thy direction, and\r\nUnspeak mine own detraction; here abjure\r\nThe taints and blames I laid upon myself,\r\nFor strangers to my nature. I am yet\r\nUnknown to woman; never was forsworn;\r\nScarcely have coveted what was mine own;\r\nAt no time broke my faith; would not betray\r\nThe devil to his fellow; and delight\r\nNo less in truth than life: my first false speaking\r\nWas this upon myself. What I am truly,\r\nIs thine and my poor country’s to command:\r\nWhither, indeed, before thy here-approach,\r\nOld Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,\r\nAlready at a point, was setting forth.\r\nNow we’ll together, and the chance of goodness\r\nBe like our warranted quarrel. Why are you silent?\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nSuch welcome and unwelcome things at once\r\n’Tis hard to reconcile.\r\n\r\n Enter a Doctor.\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nWell; more anon.—Comes the King forth, I pray you?\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nAy, sir. There are a crew of wretched souls\r\nThat stay his cure: their malady convinces\r\nThe great assay of art; but at his touch,\r\nSuch sanctity hath heaven given his hand,\r\nThey presently amend.\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nI thank you, doctor.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Doctor._]\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nWhat’s the disease he means?\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\n’Tis call’d the evil:\r\nA most miraculous work in this good king;\r\nWhich often, since my here-remain in England,\r\nI have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,\r\nHimself best knows, but strangely-visited people,\r\nAll swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,\r\nThe mere despair of surgery, he cures;\r\nHanging a golden stamp about their necks,\r\nPut on with holy prayers: and ’tis spoken,\r\nTo the succeeding royalty he leaves\r\nThe healing benediction. With this strange virtue,\r\nHe hath a heavenly gift of prophecy;\r\nAnd sundry blessings hang about his throne,\r\nThat speak him full of grace.\r\n\r\n Enter Ross.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nSee, who comes here?\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nMy countryman; but yet I know him not.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nMy ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nI know him now. Good God, betimes remove\r\nThe means that makes us strangers!\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nSir, amen.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nStands Scotland where it did?\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nAlas, poor country,\r\nAlmost afraid to know itself! It cannot\r\nBe call’d our mother, but our grave, where nothing,\r\nBut who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;\r\nWhere sighs, and groans, and shrieks, that rent the air,\r\nAre made, not mark’d; where violent sorrow seems\r\nA modern ecstasy. The dead man’s knell\r\nIs there scarce ask’d for who; and good men’s lives\r\nExpire before the flowers in their caps,\r\nDying or ere they sicken.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nO, relation\r\nToo nice, and yet too true!\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nWhat’s the newest grief?\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nThat of an hour’s age doth hiss the speaker;\r\nEach minute teems a new one.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nHow does my wife?\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nWhy, well.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nAnd all my children?\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nWell too.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nThe tyrant has not batter’d at their peace?\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nNo; they were well at peace when I did leave ’em.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nBe not a niggard of your speech: how goes’t?\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nWhen I came hither to transport the tidings,\r\nWhich I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour\r\nOf many worthy fellows that were out;\r\nWhich was to my belief witness’d the rather,\r\nFor that I saw the tyrant’s power afoot.\r\nNow is the time of help. Your eye in Scotland\r\nWould create soldiers, make our women fight,\r\nTo doff their dire distresses.\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nBe’t their comfort\r\nWe are coming thither. Gracious England hath\r\nLent us good Siward and ten thousand men;\r\nAn older and a better soldier none\r\nThat Christendom gives out.\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nWould I could answer\r\nThis comfort with the like! But I have words\r\nThat would be howl’d out in the desert air,\r\nWhere hearing should not latch them.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nWhat concern they?\r\nThe general cause? or is it a fee-grief\r\nDue to some single breast?\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nNo mind that’s honest\r\nBut in it shares some woe, though the main part\r\nPertains to you alone.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nIf it be mine,\r\nKeep it not from me, quickly let me have it.\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nLet not your ears despise my tongue for ever,\r\nWhich shall possess them with the heaviest sound\r\nThat ever yet they heard.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nHumh! I guess at it.\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nYour castle is surpris’d; your wife and babes\r\nSavagely slaughter’d. To relate the manner\r\nWere, on the quarry of these murder’d deer,\r\nTo add the death of you.\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nMerciful heaven!—\r\nWhat, man! ne’er pull your hat upon your brows.\r\nGive sorrow words. The grief that does not speak\r\nWhispers the o’er-fraught heart, and bids it break.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nMy children too?\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nWife, children, servants, all\r\nThat could be found.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nAnd I must be from thence!\r\nMy wife kill’d too?\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nI have said.\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nBe comforted:\r\nLet’s make us med’cines of our great revenge,\r\nTo cure this deadly grief.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nHe has no children.—All my pretty ones?\r\nDid you say all?—O hell-kite!—All?\r\nWhat, all my pretty chickens and their dam\r\nAt one fell swoop?\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nDispute it like a man.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nI shall do so;\r\nBut I must also feel it as a man:\r\nI cannot but remember such things were,\r\nThat were most precious to me.—Did heaven look on,\r\nAnd would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,\r\nThey were all struck for thee! Naught that I am,\r\nNot for their own demerits, but for mine,\r\nFell slaughter on their souls: heaven rest them now!\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nBe this the whetstone of your sword. Let grief\r\nConvert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.\r\n\r\nMACDUFF.\r\nO, I could play the woman with mine eyes,\r\nAnd braggart with my tongue!—But, gentle heavens,\r\nCut short all intermission; front to front,\r\nBring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;\r\nWithin my sword’s length set him; if he ’scape,\r\nHeaven forgive him too!\r\n\r\nMALCOLM.\r\nThis tune goes manly.\r\nCome, go we to the King. Our power is ready;\r\nOur lack is nothing but our leave. Macbeth\r\nIs ripe for shaking, and the powers above\r\nPut on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may;\r\nThe night is long that never finds the day.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\nACT V\r\n\r\nSCENE I. Dunsinane. A Room in the Castle.\r\n\r\n Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nI have two nights watched with you, but can perceive no truth in your\r\nreport. When was it she last walked?\r\n\r\nGENTLEWOMAN.\r\nSince his Majesty went into the field, I have seen her rise from her\r\nbed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper,\r\nfold it, write upon’t, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to\r\nbed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nA great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the benefit of\r\nsleep, and do the effects of watching. In this slumbery agitation,\r\nbesides her walking and other actual performances, what, at any time,\r\nhave you heard her say?\r\n\r\nGENTLEWOMAN.\r\nThat, sir, which I will not report after her.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nYou may to me; and ’tis most meet you should.\r\n\r\nGENTLEWOMAN.\r\nNeither to you nor anyone; having no witness to confirm my speech.\r\n\r\n Enter Lady Macbeth with a taper.\r\n\r\nLo you, here she comes! This is her very guise; and, upon my life, fast\r\nasleep. Observe her; stand close.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nHow came she by that light?\r\n\r\nGENTLEWOMAN.\r\nWhy, it stood by her: she has light by her continually; ’tis her\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nYou see, her eyes are open.\r\n\r\nGENTLEWOMAN.\r\nAy, but their sense are shut.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nWhat is it she does now? Look how she rubs her hands.\r\n\r\nGENTLEWOMAN.\r\nIt is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus washing her hands. I\r\nhave known her continue in this a quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nYet here’s a spot.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nHark, she speaks. I will set down what comes from her, to satisfy my\r\nremembrance the more strongly.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nOut, damned spot! out, I say! One; two. Why, then ’tis time to do’t.\r\nHell is murky! Fie, my lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we\r\nfear who knows it, when none can call our power to account? Yet who\r\nwould have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him?\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nDo you mark that?\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nThe Thane of Fife had a wife. Where is she now?—What, will these hands\r\nne’er be clean? No more o’ that, my lord, no more o’ that: you mar all\r\nwith this starting.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nGo to, go to. You have known what you should not.\r\n\r\nGENTLEWOMAN.\r\nShe has spoke what she should not, I am sure of that: heaven knows what\r\nshe has known.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nHere’s the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes of Arabia will\r\nnot sweeten this little hand. Oh, oh, oh!\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nWhat a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.\r\n\r\nGENTLEWOMAN.\r\nI would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nWell, well, well.\r\n\r\nGENTLEWOMAN.\r\nPray God it be, sir.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nThis disease is beyond my practice: yet I have known those which have\r\nwalked in their sleep, who have died holily in their beds.\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nWash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so pale. I tell you\r\nyet again, Banquo’s buried; he cannot come out on’s grave.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nEven so?\r\n\r\nLADY MACBETH.\r\nTo bed, to bed. There’s knocking at the gate. Come, come, come, come,\r\ngive me your hand. What’s done cannot be undone. To bed, to bed, to\r\nbed.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nWill she go now to bed?\r\n\r\nGENTLEWOMAN.\r\nDirectly.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nFoul whisp’rings are abroad. Unnatural deeds\r\nDo breed unnatural troubles: infected minds\r\nTo their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets.\r\nMore needs she the divine than the physician.—\r\nGod, God, forgive us all! Look after her;\r\nRemove from her the means of all annoyance,\r\nAnd still keep eyes upon her. So, good night:\r\nMy mind she has mated, and amaz’d my sight.\r\nI think, but dare not speak.\r\n\r\nGENTLEWOMAN.\r\nGood night, good doctor.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II.

That way are they coming.\r\n\r\nCAITHNESS.\r\nWho knows if Donalbain be with his brother?\r\n\r\nLENNOX.\r\nFor certain, sir, he is not. I have a file\r\nOf all the gentry: there is Siward’s son\r\nAnd many unrough youths, that even now\r\nProtest their first of manhood.\r\n\r\nMENTEITH.\r\nWhat does the tyrant?\r\n\r\nCAITHNESS.\r\nGreat Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.\r\nSome say he’s mad; others, that lesser hate him,\r\nDo call it valiant fury: but, for certain,\r\nHe cannot buckle his distemper’d cause\r\nWithin the belt of rule.\r\n\r\nANGUS.\r\nNow does he feel\r\nHis secret murders sticking on his hands;\r\nNow minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;\r\nThose he commands move only in command,\r\nNothing in love: now does he feel his title\r\nHang loose about him, like a giant’s robe\r\nUpon a dwarfish thief.\r\n\r\nMENTEITH.\r\nWho, then, shall blame\r\nHis pester’d senses to recoil and start,\r\nWhen all that is within him does condemn\r\nItself for being there?\r\n\r\nCAITHNESS.\r\nWell, march we on,\r\nTo give obedience where ’tis truly ow’d:\r\nMeet we the med’cine of the sickly weal;\r\nAnd with him pour we, in our country’s purge,\r\nEach drop of us.\r\n\r\nLENNOX.\r\nOr so much as it needs\r\nTo dew the sovereign flower, and drown the weeds.\r\nMake we our march towards Birnam.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt, marching._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III.

What’s the boy Malcolm?\r\nWas he not born of woman? The spirits that know\r\nAll mortal consequences have pronounc’d me thus:\r\n“Fear not, Macbeth; no man that’s born of woman\r\nShall e’er have power upon thee.”—Then fly, false thanes,\r\nAnd mingle with the English epicures:\r\nThe mind I sway by, and the heart I bear,\r\nShall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.\r\n\r\n Enter a Servant.\r\n\r\nThe devil damn thee black, thou cream-fac’d loon!\r\nWhere gott’st thou that goose look?\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nThere is ten thousand—\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nGeese, villain?\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nSoldiers, sir.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nGo prick thy face and over-red thy fear,\r\nThou lily-liver’d boy.

Hear’st thou of them?\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nAy, my good lord. Your royal preparation\r\nMakes us hear something.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nBring it after me.—\r\nI will not be afraid of death and bane,\r\nTill Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt all except Doctor._]\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nWere I from Dunsinane away and clear,\r\nProfit again should hardly draw me here.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV.

I have supp’d full with horrors;\r\nDireness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts,\r\nCannot once start me.\r\n\r\n Enter Seyton.\r\n\r\nWherefore was that cry?\r\n\r\nSEYTON.\r\nThe Queen, my lord, is dead.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nShe should have died hereafter.\r\nThere would have been a time for such a word.\r\nTomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,\r\nCreeps in this petty pace from day to day,\r\nTo the last syllable of recorded time;\r\nAnd all our yesterdays have lighted fools\r\nThe way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!\r\nLife’s but a walking shadow; a poor player,\r\nThat struts and frets his hour upon the stage,\r\nAnd then is heard no more: it is a tale\r\nTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,\r\nSignifying nothing.\r\n\r\n Enter a Messenger.\r\n\r\nThou com’st to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nGracious my lord,\r\nI should report that which I say I saw,\r\nBut know not how to do’t.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nWell, say, sir.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nAs I did stand my watch upon the hill,\r\nI look’d toward Birnam, and anon, methought,\r\nThe wood began to move.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nLiar, and slave!\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nLet me endure your wrath, if’t be not so.\r\nWithin this three mile may you see it coming;\r\nI say, a moving grove.\r\n\r\nMACBETH.\r\nIf thou speak’st false,\r\nUpon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,\r\nTill famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,\r\nI care not if thou dost for me as much.—\r\nI pull in resolution; and begin\r\nTo doubt th’ equivocation of the fiend,\r\nThat lies like truth. “Fear not, till Birnam wood\r\nDo come to Dunsinane;” and now a wood\r\nComes toward Dunsinane.—Arm, arm, and out!—\r\nIf this which he avouches does appear,\r\nThere is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.\r\nI ’gin to be aweary of the sun,\r\nAnd wish th’ estate o’ th’ world were now undone.—\r\nRing the alarum bell!—Blow, wind! come, wrack!\r\nAt least we’ll die with harness on our back.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE VI.

What’s more to do,\r\nWhich would be planted newly with the time,—\r\nAs calling home our exil’d friends abroad,\r\nThat fled the snares of watchful tyranny;\r\nProducing forth the cruel ministers\r\nOf this dead butcher, and his fiend-like queen,\r\nWho, as ’tis thought, by self and violent hands\r\nTook off her life;—this, and what needful else\r\nThat calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,\r\nWe will perform in measure, time, and place.\r\nSo thanks to all at once, and to each one,\r\nWhom we invite to see us crown’d at Scone.\r\n\r\n [_Flourish.

An apartment in the Duke’s palace.\r\n\nEnter Duke, Escalus, Lords and Attendants.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nEscalus.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nMy lord.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nOf government the properties to unfold\r\nWould seem in me t’ affect speech and discourse,\r\nSince I am put to know that your own science\r\nExceeds, in that, the lists of all advice\r\nMy strength can give you. Then no more remains\r\nBut that, to your sufficiency, as your worth is able,\r\nAnd let them work. The nature of our people,\r\nOur city’s institutions, and the terms\r\nFor common justice, you’re as pregnant in\r\nAs art and practice hath enriched any\r\nThat we remember. There is our commission,\r\nFrom which we would not have you warp.—Call hither,\r\nI say, bid come before us, Angelo.\r\n\r\n[_Exit an Attendant._]\r\n\r\nWhat figure of us think you he will bear?\r\nFor you must know we have with special soul\r\nElected him our absence to supply;\r\nLent him our terror, drest him with our love,\r\nAnd given his deputation all the organs\r\nOf our own power. What think you of it?\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nIf any in Vienna be of worth\r\nTo undergo such ample grace and honour,\r\nIt is Lord Angelo.\r\n\r\nEnter Angelo.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nLook where he comes.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nAlways obedient to your Grace’s will,\r\nI come to know your pleasure.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nAngelo,\r\nThere is a kind of character in thy life\r\nThat to th’ observer doth thy history\r\nFully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings\r\nAre not thine own so proper as to waste\r\nThyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.\r\nHeaven doth with us as we with torches do,\r\nNot light them for themselves; for if our virtues\r\nDid not go forth of us, ’twere all alike\r\nAs if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touched\r\nBut to fine issues; nor nature never lends\r\nThe smallest scruple of her excellence\r\nBut, like a thrifty goddess, she determines\r\nHerself the glory of a creditor,\r\nBoth thanks and use. But I do bend my speech\r\nTo one that can my part in him advertise.\r\nHold, therefore, Angelo.\r\nIn our remove be thou at full ourself.\r\nMortality and mercy in Vienna\r\nLive in thy tongue and heart. Old Escalus,\r\nThough first in question, is thy secondary.\r\nTake thy commission.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nNow, good my lord,\r\nLet there be some more test made of my metal,\r\nBefore so noble and so great a figure\r\nBe stamped upon it.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nNo more evasion.\r\nWe have with a leavened and prepared choice\r\nProceeded to you; therefore take your honours.\r\nOur haste from hence is of so quick condition\r\nThat it prefers itself, and leaves unquestioned\r\nMatters of needful value. We shall write to you,\r\nAs time and our concernings shall importune,\r\nHow it goes with us; and do look to know\r\nWhat doth befall you here. So, fare you well.\r\nTo th’ hopeful execution do I leave you\r\nOf your commissions.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nYet give leave, my lord,\r\nThat we may bring you something on the way.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nMy haste may not admit it;\r\nNor need you, on mine honour, have to do\r\nWith any scruple. Your scope is as mine own,\r\nSo to enforce or qualify the laws\r\nAs to your soul seems good. Give me your hand;\r\nI’ll privily away. I love the people,\r\nBut do not like to stage me to their eyes.\r\nThough it do well, I do not relish well\r\nTheir loud applause and _Aves_ vehement;\r\nNor do I think the man of safe discretion\r\nThat does affect it. Once more, fare you well.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nThe heavens give safety to your purposes!\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nLead forth and bring you back in happiness.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nI thank you. Fare you well.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nI shall desire you, sir, to give me leave\r\nTo have free speech with you; and it concerns me\r\nTo look into the bottom of my place.\r\nA power I have, but of what strength and nature\r\nI am not yet instructed.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\n’Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,\r\nAnd we may soon our satisfaction have\r\nTouching that point.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nI’ll wait upon your honour.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. A street.\r\n\r\nEnter Lucio and two other Gentlemen.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nIf the Duke, with the other dukes, come not to composition with the\r\nKing of Hungary, why then all the dukes fall upon the King.\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\r\nHeaven grant us its peace, but not the King of Hungary’s!\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nThou conclud’st like the sanctimonious pirate that went to sea with the\r\nten commandments, but scraped one out of the table.\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\r\n“Thou shalt not steal”?\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nAy, that he razed.\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\r\nWhy, ’twas a commandment to command the captain and all the rest from\r\ntheir functions! They put forth to steal. There’s not a soldier of us\r\nall that, in the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition well\r\nthat prays for peace.\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\r\nI never heard any soldier dislike it.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nI believe thee; for I think thou never wast where grace was said.\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\r\nNo? A dozen times at least.\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\r\nWhat? In metre?\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nIn any proportion or in any language.\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\r\nI think, or in any religion.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nAy, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all controversy; as, for\r\nexample, thou thyself art a wicked villain, despite of all grace.\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\r\nWell, there went but a pair of shears between us.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nI grant, as there may between the lists and the velvet. Thou art the\r\nlist.\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\r\nAnd thou the velvet. Thou art good velvet; thou’rt a three-piled piece,\r\nI warrant thee. I had as lief be a list of an English kersey as be\r\npiled, as thou art piled, for a French velvet. Do I speak feelingly\r\nnow?\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nI think thou dost, and indeed, with most painful feeling of thy speech.\r\nI will, out of thine own confession, learn to begin thy health; but,\r\nwhilst I live, forget to drink after thee.\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\r\nI think I have done myself wrong, have I not?\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\r\nYes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free.\r\n\r\nEnter Mistress Overdone, a Bawd.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nBehold, behold, where Madam Mitigation comes! I have purchased as many\r\ndiseases under her roof as come to—\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\r\nTo what, I pray?\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\r\nJudge.\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\r\nTo three thousand dolours a year.\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\r\nAy, and more.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nA French crown more.\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\r\nThou art always figuring diseases in me, but thou art full of error; I\r\nam sound.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nNay, not, as one would say, healthy, but so sound as things that are\r\nhollow. Thy bones are hollow. Impiety has made a feast of thee.\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\r\nHow now, which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nWell, well! There’s one yonder arrested and carried to prison was worth\r\nfive thousand of you all.\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\r\nWho’s that, I pray thee?\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nMarry, sir, that’s Claudio, Signior Claudio.\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\r\nClaudio to prison? ’Tis not so.\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nNay, but I know ’tis so. I saw him arrested, saw him carried away; and,\r\nwhich is more, within these three days his head to be chopped off.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nBut, after all this fooling, I would not have it so. Art thou sure of\r\nthis?\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nI am too sure of it. And it is for getting Madam Julietta with child.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nBelieve me, this may be. He promised to meet me two hours since, and he\r\nwas ever precise in promise-keeping.\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\r\nBesides, you know, it draws something near to the speech we had to such\r\na purpose.\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\r\nBut most of all agreeing with the proclamation.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nAway! Let’s go learn the truth of it.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Lucio and Gentlemen._]\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nThus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what with the gallows,\r\nand what with poverty, I am custom-shrunk.\r\n\r\nEnter Pompey.\r\n\r\nHow now? What’s the news with you?\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nYonder man is carried to prison.\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nWell, what has he done?\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nA woman.\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nBut what’s his offence?\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nGroping for trouts in a peculiar river.\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nWhat? Is there a maid with child by him?\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nNo, but there’s a woman with maid by him. You have not heard of the\r\nproclamation, have you?\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nWhat proclamation, man?\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nAll houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down.\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nAnd what shall become of those in the city?\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nThey shall stand for seed. They had gone down too, but that a wise\r\nburgher put in for them.\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nBut shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be pulled down?\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nTo the ground, mistress.\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nWhy, here’s a change indeed in the commonwealth! What shall become of\r\nme?\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nCome, fear not you. Good counsellors lack no clients. Though you change\r\nyour place, you need not change your trade. I’ll be your tapster still.\r\nCourage, there will be pity taken on you. You that have worn your eyes\r\nalmost out in the service, you will be considered.\r\n\r\nEnter Provost, Claudio, Juliet and Officers.\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nWhat’s to do here, Thomas Tapster? Let’s withdraw.\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nHere comes Signior Claudio, led by the Provost to prison. And there’s\r\nMadam Juliet.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Bawd and Pompey._]\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nFellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?\r\nBear me to prison, where I am committed.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nI do it not in evil disposition,\r\nBut from Lord Angelo by special charge.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nThus can the demi-god Authority\r\nMake us pay down for our offence by weight.\r\nThe words of heaven; on whom it will, it will;\r\nOn whom it will not, so; yet still ’tis just.\r\n\r\nEnter Lucio and two Gentlemen.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nWhy, how now, Claudio? Whence comes this restraint?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nFrom too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty.\r\nAs surfeit is the father of much fast,\r\nSo every scope by the immoderate use\r\nTurns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,\r\nLike rats that ravin down their proper bane,\r\nA thirsty evil; and when we drink, we die.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nIf I could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would send for certain of\r\nmy creditors; and yet, to say the truth, I had as lief have the foppery\r\nof freedom as the morality of imprisonment. What’s thy offence,\r\nClaudio?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nWhat but to speak of would offend again.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nWhat, is’t murder?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nLechery?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nCall it so.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nAway, sir; you must go.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nOne word, good friend.—Lucio, a word with you.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nA hundred, if they’ll do you any good. Is lechery so looked after?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nThus stands it with me: upon a true contract\r\nI got possession of Julietta’s bed.\r\nYou know the lady; she is fast my wife,\r\nSave that we do the denunciation lack\r\nOf outward order. This we came not to\r\nOnly for propagation of a dower\r\nRemaining in the coffer of her friends,\r\nFrom whom we thought it meet to hide our love\r\nTill time had made them for us. But it chances\r\nThe stealth of our most mutual entertainment\r\nWith character too gross is writ on Juliet.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nWith child, perhaps?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nUnhappily, even so.\r\nAnd the new deputy now for the Duke—\r\nWhether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,\r\nOr whether that the body public be\r\nA horse whereon the governor doth ride,\r\nWho, newly in the seat, that it may know\r\nHe can command, lets it straight feel the spur;\r\nWhether the tyranny be in his place,\r\nOr in his eminence that fills it up,\r\nI stagger in—but this new governor\r\nAwakes me all the enrolled penalties\r\nWhich have, like unscoured armour, hung by th’ wall\r\nSo long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round,\r\nAnd none of them been worn; and for a name\r\nNow puts the drowsy and neglected act\r\nFreshly on me. ’Tis surely for a name.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nI warrant it is. And thy head stands so tickle on thy shoulders that a\r\nmilkmaid, if she be in love, may sigh it off. Send after the Duke, and\r\nappeal to him.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nI have done so, but he’s not to be found.\r\nI prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:\r\nThis day my sister should the cloister enter,\r\nAnd there receive her approbation.\r\nAcquaint her with the danger of my state;\r\nImplore her, in my voice, that she make friends\r\nTo the strict deputy; bid herself assay him.\r\nI have great hope in that. For in her youth\r\nThere is a prone and speechless dialect\r\nSuch as moves men; beside, she hath prosperous art\r\nWhen she will play with reason and discourse,\r\nAnd well she can persuade.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nI pray she may, as well for the encouragement of the like, which else\r\nwould stand under grievous imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life,\r\nwho I would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a game of\r\ntick-tack. I’ll to her.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nI thank you, good friend Lucio.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nWithin two hours.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nCome, officer, away.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. A monastery.\r\n\r\nEnter Duke and Friar Thomas.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nNo, holy father, throw away that thought;\r\nBelieve not that the dribbling dart of love\r\nCan pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee\r\nTo give me secret harbour hath a purpose\r\nMore grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends\r\nOf burning youth.\r\n\r\nFRIAR THOMAS.\r\nMay your Grace speak of it?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nMy holy sir, none better knows than you\r\nHow I have ever loved the life removed,\r\nAnd held in idle price to haunt assemblies\r\nWhere youth, and cost, a witless bravery keeps.\r\nI have delivered to Lord Angelo,\r\nA man of stricture and firm abstinence,\r\nMy absolute power and place here in Vienna,\r\nAnd he supposes me travelled to Poland;\r\nFor so I have strewed it in the common ear,\r\nAnd so it is received. Now, pious sir,\r\nYou will demand of me why I do this?\r\n\r\nFRIAR THOMAS.\r\nGladly, my lord.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWe have strict statutes and most biting laws,\r\nThe needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,\r\nWhich for this fourteen years we have let slip,\r\nEven like an o’ergrown lion in a cave\r\nThat goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,\r\nHaving bound up the threat’ning twigs of birch,\r\nOnly to stick it in their children’s sight\r\nFor terror, not to use, in time the rod\r\nBecomes more mocked than feared: so our decrees,\r\nDead to infliction, to themselves are dead,\r\nAnd liberty plucks justice by the nose,\r\nThe baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart\r\nGoes all decorum.\r\n\r\nFRIAR THOMAS.\r\nIt rested in your Grace\r\nTo unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased;\r\nAnd it in you more dreadful would have seemed\r\nThan in Lord Angelo.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nI do fear, too dreadful.\r\nSith ’twas my fault to give the people scope,\r\n’Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them\r\nFor what I bid them do; for we bid this be done\r\nWhen evil deeds have their permissive pass\r\nAnd not the punishment. Therefore, indeed, my father,\r\nI have on Angelo imposed the office;\r\nWho may in th’ ambush of my name strike home,\r\nAnd yet my nature never in the fight\r\nTo do in slander. And to behold his sway,\r\nI will, as ’twere a brother of your order,\r\nVisit both prince and people. Therefore, I prithee,\r\nSupply me with the habit, and instruct me\r\nHow I may formally in person bear\r\nLike a true friar. Moe reasons for this action\r\nAt our more leisure shall I render you;\r\nOnly, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;\r\nStands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses\r\nThat his blood flows or that his appetite\r\nIs more to bread than stone. Hence shall we see,\r\nIf power change purpose, what our seemers be.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV. A nunnery.\r\n\r\nEnter Isabella and Francisca, a Nun.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nAnd have you nuns no farther privileges?\r\n\r\nFRANCISCA.\r\nAre not these large enough?\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nYes, truly; I speak not as desiring more,\r\nBut rather wishing a more strict restraint\r\nUpon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\n[_Within_.] Ho! Peace be in this place!\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nWho’s that which calls?\r\n\r\nFRANCISCA.\r\nIt is a man’s voice. Gentle Isabella,\r\nTurn you the key, and know his business of him;\r\nYou may, I may not; you are yet unsworn.\r\nWhen you have vowed, you must not speak with men\r\nBut in the presence of the prioress;\r\nThen, if you speak, you must not show your face;\r\nOr if you show your face, you must not speak.\r\nHe calls again. I pray you answer him.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Francisca._]\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nPeace and prosperity! Who is’t that calls?\r\n\r\nEnter Lucio.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nHail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses\r\nProclaim you are no less. Can you so stead me\r\nAs bring me to the sight of Isabella,\r\nA novice of this place, and the fair sister\r\nTo her unhappy brother Claudio?\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nWhy “her unhappy brother”? let me ask,\r\nThe rather for I now must make you know\r\nI am that Isabella, and his sister.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nGentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you.\r\nNot to be weary with you, he’s in prison.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nWoe me! For what?\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nFor that which, if myself might be his judge,\r\nHe should receive his punishment in thanks:\r\nHe hath got his friend with child.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nSir, make me not your story.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\n’Tis true.\r\nI would not, though ’tis my familiar sin\r\nWith maids to seem the lapwing, and to jest,\r\nTongue far from heart, play with all virgins so.\r\nI hold you as a thing enskied and sainted\r\nBy your renouncement an immortal spirit,\r\nAnd to be talked with in sincerity,\r\nAs with a saint.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nYou do blaspheme the good in mocking me.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nDo not believe it. Fewness and truth, ’tis thus:\r\nYour brother and his lover have embraced;\r\nAs those that feed grow full, as blossoming time\r\nThat from the seedness the bare fallow brings\r\nTo teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb\r\nExpresseth his full tilth and husbandry.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nSomeone with child by him? My cousin Juliet?\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nIs she your cousin?\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nAdoptedly, as school-maids change their names\r\nBy vain though apt affection.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nShe it is.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nO, let him marry her!\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nThis is the point.\r\nThe Duke is very strangely gone from hence;\r\nBore many gentlemen, myself being one,\r\nIn hand, and hope of action; but we do learn,\r\nBy those that know the very nerves of state,\r\nHis givings-out were of an infinite distance\r\nFrom his true-meant design. Upon his place,\r\nAnd with full line of his authority,\r\nGoverns Lord Angelo; a man whose blood\r\nIs very snow-broth; one who never feels\r\nThe wanton stings and motions of the sense;\r\nBut doth rebate and blunt his natural edge\r\nWith profits of the mind, study and fast.\r\nHe, to give fear to use and liberty,\r\nWhich have for long run by the hideous law\r\nAs mice by lions, hath picked out an act,\r\nUnder whose heavy sense your brother’s life\r\nFalls into forfeit. He arrests him on it,\r\nAnd follows close the rigour of the statute\r\nTo make him an example. All hope is gone,\r\nUnless you have the grace by your fair prayer\r\nTo soften Angelo. And that’s my pith of business\r\n’Twixt you and your poor brother.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nDoth he so\r\nSeek his life?\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nHas censured him already;\r\nAnd, as I hear, the Provost hath a warrant\r\nFor’s execution.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nAlas, what poor ability’s in me\r\nTo do him good?\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nAssay the power you have.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nMy power? Alas, I doubt.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nOur doubts are traitors,\r\nAnd make us lose the good we oft might win\r\nBy fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,\r\nAnd let him learn to know, when maidens sue,\r\nMen give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,\r\nAll their petitions are as freely theirs\r\nAs they themselves would owe them.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nI’ll see what I can do.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nBut speedily.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nI will about it straight;\r\nNo longer staying but to give the Mother\r\nNotice of my affair. I humbly thank you.\r\nCommend me to my brother. Soon at night\r\nI’ll send him certain word of my success.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nI take my leave of you.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nGood sir, adieu.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\nACT II\r\n\r\nSCENE I. A hall in Angelo’s house.\r\n\nEnter Angelo, Escalus, Servants, and a Justice.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nWe must not make a scarecrow of the law,\r\nSetting it up to fear the birds of prey,\r\nAnd let it keep one shape till custom make it\r\nTheir perch, and not their terror.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nAy, but yet\r\nLet us be keen, and rather cut a little\r\nThan fall and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman,\r\nWhom I would save, had a most noble father.\r\nLet but your honour know,\r\nWhom I believe to be most strait in virtue,\r\nThat, in the working of your own affections,\r\nHad time cohered with place, or place with wishing,\r\nOr that the resolute acting of your blood\r\nCould have attained th’ effect of your own purpose,\r\nWhether you had not sometime in your life\r\nErred in this point which now you censure him,\r\nAnd pulled the law upon you.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\n’Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,\r\nAnother thing to fall. I not deny\r\nThe jury passing on the prisoner’s life\r\nMay in the sworn twelve have a thief or two\r\nGuiltier than him they try. What’s open made to justice,\r\nThat justice seizes. What knows the laws\r\nThat thieves do pass on thieves? ’Tis very pregnant,\r\nThe jewel that we find, we stoop and take ’t,\r\nBecause we see it; but what we do not see,\r\nWe tread upon, and never think of it.\r\nYou may not so extenuate his offence\r\nFor I have had such faults; but rather tell me,\r\nWhen I that censure him do so offend,\r\nLet mine own judgement pattern out my death,\r\nAnd nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.\r\n\r\nEnter Provost.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nBe it as your wisdom will.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nWhere is the Provost?\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nHere, if it like your honour.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nSee that Claudio\r\nBe executed by nine tomorrow morning.\r\nBring him his confessor, let him be prepared,\r\nFor that’s the utmost of his pilgrimage.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Provost._]\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nWell, heaven forgive him; and forgive us all.\r\nSome rise by sin, and some by virtue fall.\r\nSome run from brakes of vice, and answer none,\r\nAnd some condemned for a fault alone.\r\n\r\nEnter Elbow and Officers with Froth and Pompey.\r\n\r\nELBOW.\r\nCome, bring them away. If these be good people in a commonweal that do\r\nnothing but use their abuses in common houses, I know no law. Bring\r\nthem away.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nHow now, sir, what’s your name? And what’s the matter?\r\n\r\nELBOW.\r\nIf it please your honour, I am the poor Duke’s constable, and my name\r\nis Elbow. I do lean upon justice, sir, and do bring in here before your\r\ngood honour two notorious benefactors.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nBenefactors? Well, what benefactors are they? Are they not malefactors?\r\n\r\nELBOW.\r\nIf it please your honour, I know not well what they are, but precise\r\nvillains they are, that I am sure of, and void of all profanation in\r\nthe world that good Christians ought to have.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nThis comes off well. Here’s a wise officer.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nGo to. What quality are they of? Elbow is your name? Why dost thou not\r\nspeak, Elbow?\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nHe cannot, sir. He’s out at elbow.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nWhat are you, sir?\r\n\r\nELBOW.\r\nHe, sir? A tapster, sir; parcel bawd; one that serves a bad woman;\r\nwhose house, sir, was, as they say, plucked down in the suburbs; and\r\nnow she professes a hot-house, which, I think is a very ill house too.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nHow know you that?\r\n\r\nELBOW.\r\nMy wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour—\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nHow? Thy wife?\r\n\r\nELBOW.\r\nAy, sir, whom I thank heaven is an honest woman—\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nDost thou detest her therefore?\r\n\r\nELBOW.\r\nI say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as she, that this house,\r\nif it be not a bawd’s house, it is pity of her life, for it is a\r\nnaughty house.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nHow dost thou know that, constable?\r\n\r\nELBOW.\r\nMarry, sir, by my wife, who, if she had been a woman cardinally given,\r\nmight have been accused in fornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nBy the woman’s means?\r\n\r\nELBOW.\r\nAy, sir, by Mistress Overdone’s means; but as she spit in his face, so\r\nshe defied him.\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nSir, if it please your honour, this is not so.\r\n\r\nELBOW.\r\nProve it before these varlets here, thou honourable man, prove it.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\n[_To Angelo_.] Do you hear how he misplaces?\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nSir, she came in great with child; and longing, saving your honour’s\r\nreverence, for stewed prunes; sir, we had but two in the house, which\r\nat that very distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit dish, a dish of\r\nsome threepence; your honours have seen such dishes; they are not china\r\ndishes, but very good dishes—\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nGo to, go to. No matter for the dish, sir.\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nNo, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in the right. But to the\r\npoint. As I say, this Mistress Elbow, being, as I say, with child, and\r\nbeing great-bellied, and longing, as I said, for prunes; and having but\r\ntwo in the dish, as I said, Master Froth here, this very man, having\r\neaten the rest, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them very\r\nhonestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I could not give you\r\nthreepence again—\r\n\r\nFROTH.\r\nNo, indeed.\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nVery well. You being then, if you be remembered, cracking the stones of\r\nthe foresaid prunes—\r\n\r\nFROTH.\r\nAy, so I did indeed.\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nWhy, very well. I telling you then, if you be remembered, that such a\r\none and such a one were past cure of the thing you wot of, unless they\r\nkept very good diet, as I told you—\r\n\r\nFROTH.\r\nAll this is true.\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nWhy, very well then—\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nCome, you are a tedious fool. To the purpose. What was done to Elbow’s\r\nwife that he hath cause to complain of? Come me to what was done to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nSir, your honour cannot come to that yet.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nNo, sir, nor I mean it not.\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nSir, but you shall come to it, by your honour’s leave. And I beseech\r\nyou, look into Master Froth here, sir, a man of fourscore pound a year;\r\nwhose father died at Hallowmas—was’t not at Hallowmas, Master Froth?\r\n\r\nFROTH.\r\nAll-hallond Eve.\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nWhy, very well. I hope here be truths. He, sir, sitting, as I say, in a\r\nlower chair, sir—’twas in the Bunch of Grapes, where, indeed, you have\r\na delight to sit, have you not?\r\n\r\nFROTH.\r\nI have so, because it is an open room, and good for winter.\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nWhy, very well then. I hope here be truths.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nThis will last out a night in Russia\r\nWhen nights are longest there. I’ll take my leave,\r\nAnd leave you to the hearing of the cause;\r\nHoping you’ll find good cause to whip them all.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nI think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Angelo._]\r\n\r\nNow, sir, come on. What was done to Elbow’s wife, once more?\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nOnce, sir? There was nothing done to her once.\r\n\r\nELBOW.\r\nI beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nI beseech your honour, ask me.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nWell, sir, what did this gentleman to her?\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nI beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman’s face. Good Master Froth,\r\nlook upon his honour; ’tis for a good purpose.—Doth your honour mark\r\nhis face?\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nAy, sir, very well.\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nNay, I beseech you, mark it well.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nWell, I do so.\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nDoth your honour see any harm in his face?\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nWhy, no.\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nI’ll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worst thing about him.\r\nGood, then, if his face be the worst thing about him, how could Master\r\nFroth do the constable’s wife any harm? I would know that of your\r\nhonour.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nHe’s in the right. Constable. What say you to it?\r\n\r\nELBOW.\r\nFirst, an it like you, the house is a respected house; next, this is a\r\nrespected fellow; and his mistress is a respected woman.\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nBy this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected person than any of us\r\nall.\r\n\r\nELBOW.\r\nVarlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! The time is yet to come\r\nthat she was ever respected with man, woman, or child.\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nSir, she was respected with him before he married with her.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nWhich is the wiser here, Justice or Iniquity? Is this true?\r\n\r\nELBOW.\r\nO thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked Hannibal! I respected with\r\nher before I was married to her? If ever I was respected with her, or\r\nshe with me, let not your worship think me the poor Duke’s officer.\r\nProve this, thou wicked Hannibal, or I’ll have mine action of battery\r\non thee.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nIf he took you a box o’ th’ ear, you might have your action of slander\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nELBOW.\r\nMarry, I thank your good worship for it. What is’t your worship’s\r\npleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nTruly, officer, because he hath some offences in him that thou wouldst\r\ndiscover if thou couldst, let him continue in his courses till thou\r\nknow’st what they are.\r\n\r\nELBOW.\r\nMarry, I thank your worship for it.—Thou seest, thou wicked varlet,\r\nnow, what’s come upon thee. Thou art to continue now, thou varlet, thou\r\nart to continue.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\n[_To Froth_.] Where were you born, friend?\r\n\r\nFROTH.\r\nHere in Vienna, sir.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nAre you of fourscore pounds a year?\r\n\r\nFROTH.\r\nYes, an’t please you, sir.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nSo. [_To Pompey_.] What trade are you of, sir?\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nA tapster, a poor widow’s tapster.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nYour mistress’ name?\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nMistress Overdone.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nHath she had any more than one husband?\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nNine, sir; Overdone by the last.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nNine?—Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master Froth, I would not have\r\nyou acquainted with tapsters; they will draw you, Master Froth, and you\r\nwill hang them. Get you gone, and let me hear no more of you.\r\n\r\nFROTH.\r\nI thank your worship. For mine own part, I never come into any room in\r\na taphouse but I am drawn in.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nWell, no more of it, Master Froth. Farewell.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Froth._]\r\n\r\nCome you hither to me, Master tapster. What’s your name, Master\r\ntapster?\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nPompey.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nWhat else?\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nBum, sir.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nTroth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you; so that, in the\r\nbeastliest sense, you are Pompey the great. Pompey, you are partly a\r\nbawd, Pompey, howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are you not?\r\nCome, tell me true, it shall be the better for you.\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nTruly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nHow would you live, Pompey? By being a bawd? What do you think of the\r\ntrade, Pompey? Is it a lawful trade?\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nIf the law would allow it, sir.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nBut the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall not be allowed in\r\nVienna.\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nDoes your worship mean to geld and splay all the youth of the city?\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nNo, Pompey.\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nTruly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to’t then. If your worship\r\nwill take order for the drabs and the knaves, you need not to fear the\r\nbawds.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nThere is pretty orders beginning, I can tell you. It is but heading and\r\nhanging.\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nIf you head and hang all that offend that way but for ten year\r\ntogether, you’ll be glad to give out a commission for more heads. If\r\nthis law hold in Vienna ten year, I’ll rent the fairest house in it\r\nafter threepence a bay. If you live to see this come to pass, say\r\nPompey told you so.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nThank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your prophecy, hark you: I\r\nadvise you, let me not find you before me again upon any complaint\r\nwhatsoever; no, not for dwelling where you do. If I do, Pompey, I shall\r\nbeat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd Caesar to you. In plain\r\ndealing, Pompey, I shall have you whipped. So for this time, Pompey,\r\nfare you well.\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nI thank your worship for your good counsel. [_Aside_.] But I shall\r\nfollow it as the flesh and fortune shall better determine.\r\nWhip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade;\r\nThe valiant heart’s not whipped out of his trade.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nCome hither to me, Master Elbow. Come hither, Master Constable. How\r\nlong have you been in this place of constable?\r\n\r\nELBOW.\r\nSeven year and a half, sir.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nI thought, by the readiness in the office, you had continued in it\r\nsometime. You say seven years together?\r\n\r\nELBOW.\r\nAnd a half, sir.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nAlas, it hath been great pains to you. They do you wrong to put you so\r\noft upon’t. Are there not men in your ward sufficient to serve it?\r\n\r\nELBOW.\r\nFaith, sir, few of any wit in such matters. As they are chosen, they\r\nare glad to choose me for them; I do it for some piece of money, and go\r\nthrough with all.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nLook you bring me in the names of some six or seven, the most\r\nsufficient of your parish.\r\n\r\nELBOW.\r\nTo your worship’s house, sir?\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nTo my house. Fare you well.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Elbow._]\r\n\r\nWhat’s o’clock, think you?\r\n\r\nJUSTICE.\r\nEleven, sir.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nI pray you home to dinner with me.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE.\r\nI humbly thank you.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nIt grieves me for the death of Claudio,\r\nBut there’s no remedy.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE.\r\nLord Angelo is severe.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nIt is but needful.\r\nMercy is not itself that oft looks so;\r\nPardon is still the nurse of second woe.\r\nBut yet, Poor Claudio! There’s no remedy.\r\nCome, sir.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. Another room in the same.\r\n\r\nEnter Provost and a Servant.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nHe’s hearing of a cause. He will come straight.\r\nI’ll tell him of you.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nPray you do.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Servant._]\r\n\r\nI’ll know\r\nHis pleasure, may be he will relent. Alas,\r\nHe hath but as offended in a dream;\r\nAll sects, all ages, smack of this vice, and he\r\nTo die for ’t!\r\n\r\nEnter Angelo.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nNow, what’s the matter, Provost?\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nIs it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nDid not I tell thee yea? Hadst thou not order?\r\nWhy dost thou ask again?\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nLest I might be too rash.\r\nUnder your good correction, I have seen\r\nWhen, after execution, judgement hath\r\nRepented o’er his doom.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nGo to; let that be mine.\r\nDo you your office, or give up your place,\r\nAnd you shall well be spared.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nI crave your honour’s pardon.\r\nWhat shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?\r\nShe’s very near her hour.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nDispose of her\r\nTo some more fitter place; and that with speed.\r\n\r\nEnter Servant.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nHere is the sister of the man condemned\r\nDesires access to you.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nHath he a sister?\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nAy, my good lord, a very virtuous maid,\r\nAnd to be shortly of a sisterhood,\r\nIf not already.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nWell, let her be admitted.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Servant._]\r\n\r\nSee you the fornicatress be removed;\r\nLet her have needful but not lavish means;\r\nThere shall be order for it.\r\n\r\nEnter Lucio and Isabella.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\n[_Offering to retire_.] Save your honour!\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nStay a little while. [_To Isabella_.] You are welcome. What’s your\r\nwill?\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nI am a woeful suitor to your honour,\r\nPlease but your honour hear me.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nWell, what’s your suit?\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nThere is a vice that most I do abhor,\r\nAnd most desire should meet the blow of justice;\r\nFor which I would not plead, but that I must;\r\nFor which I must not plead, but that I am\r\nAt war ’twixt will and will not.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nWell, the matter?\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nI have a brother is condemned to die;\r\nI do beseech you, let it be his fault,\r\nAnd not my brother.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nHeaven give thee moving graces.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nCondemn the fault, and not the actor of it?\r\nWhy, every fault’s condemned ere it be done.\r\nMine were the very cipher of a function\r\nTo find the faults whose fine stands in record,\r\nAnd let go by the actor.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nO just but severe law!\r\nI had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour!\r\n\r\n[_Going._]\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\n[_To Isabella_.] Give’t not o’er so. To him again, entreat him,\r\nKneel down before him, hang upon his gown;\r\nYou are too cold. If you should need a pin,\r\nYou could not with more tame a tongue desire it.\r\nTo him, I say.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nMust he needs die?\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nMaiden, no remedy.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nYes, I do think that you might pardon him,\r\nAnd neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nI will not do’t.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nBut can you if you would?\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nLook, what I will not, that I cannot do.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nBut might you do’t, and do the world no wrong,\r\nIf so your heart were touched with that remorse\r\nAs mine is to him?\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nHe’s sentenced, ’tis too late.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\n[_To Isabella_.] You are too cold.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nToo late? Why, no. I that do speak a word\r\nMay call it back again. Well, believe this:\r\nNo ceremony that to great ones longs,\r\nNot the king’s crown, nor the deputed sword,\r\nThe marshal’s truncheon, nor the judge’s robe,\r\nBecome them with one half so good a grace\r\nAs mercy does.\r\nIf he had been as you, and you as he,\r\nYou would have slipped like him, but he like you\r\nWould not have been so stern.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nPray you be gone.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nI would to heaven I had your potency,\r\nAnd you were Isabel! Should it then be thus?\r\nNo; I would tell what ’twere to be a judge\r\nAnd what a prisoner.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\n[_Aside_.] Ay, touch him; there’s the vein.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nYour brother is a forfeit of the law,\r\nAnd you but waste your words.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nAlas, alas!\r\nWhy, all the souls that were were forfeit once,\r\nAnd He that might the vantage best have took\r\nFound out the remedy. How would you be\r\nIf He, which is the top of judgement, should\r\nBut judge you as you are? O, think on that,\r\nAnd mercy then will breathe within your lips,\r\nLike man new made.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nBe you content, fair maid.\r\nIt is the law, not I, condemns your brother.\r\nWere he my kinsman, brother, or my son,\r\nIt should be thus with him. He must die tomorrow.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nTomorrow? O, that’s sudden! Spare him, spare him!\r\nHe’s not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens\r\nWe kill the fowl of season. Shall we serve heaven\r\nWith less respect than we do minister\r\nTo our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you.\r\nWho is it that hath died for this offence?\r\nThere’s many have committed it.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nAy, well said.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nThe law hath not been dead, though it hath slept.\r\nThose many had not dared to do that evil\r\nIf the first that did th’ edict infringe\r\nHad answered for his deed. Now ’tis awake,\r\nTakes note of what is done, and, like a prophet,\r\nLooks in a glass that shows what future evils,\r\nEither now, or by remissness new conceived,\r\nAnd so in progress to be hatched and born,\r\nAre now to have no successive degrees,\r\nBut, where they live, to end.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nYet show some pity.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nI show it most of all when I show justice;\r\nFor then I pity those I do not know,\r\nWhich a dismissed offence would after gall,\r\nAnd do him right that, answering one foul wrong,\r\nLives not to act another. Be satisfied;\r\nYour brother dies tomorrow; be content.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nSo you must be the first that gives this sentence,\r\nAnd he that suffers. O, it is excellent\r\nTo have a giant’s strength; but it is tyrannous\r\nTo use it like a giant.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nThat’s well said.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nCould great men thunder\r\nAs Jove himself does, Jove would ne’er be quiet,\r\nFor every pelting petty officer\r\nWould use his heaven for thunder.\r\nNothing but thunder. Merciful Heaven,\r\nThou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt\r\nSplits the unwedgeable and gnarled oak,\r\nThan the soft myrtle. But man, proud man,\r\nDressed in a little brief authority,\r\nMost ignorant of what he’s most assured,\r\nHis glassy essence, like an angry ape\r\nPlays such fantastic tricks before high heaven\r\nAs makes the angels weep; who, with our spleens,\r\nWould all themselves laugh mortal.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nO, to him, to him, wench! He will relent;\r\nHe’s coming. I perceive ’t.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nPray heaven she win him.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nWe cannot weigh our brother with ourself.\r\nGreat men may jest with saints; ’tis wit in them,\r\nBut in the less, foul profanation.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nThou’rt i’ th’ right, girl; more o’ that.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nThat in the captain’s but a choleric word\r\nWhich in the soldier is flat blasphemy.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nArt advised o’ that? More on’t.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nWhy do you put these sayings upon me?\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nBecause authority, though it err like others,\r\nHath yet a kind of medicine in itself\r\nThat skins the vice o’ th’ top. Go to your bosom,\r\nKnock there, and ask your heart what it doth know\r\nThat’s like my brother’s fault. If it confess\r\nA natural guiltiness such as is his,\r\nLet it not sound a thought upon your tongue\r\nAgainst my brother’s life.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nShe speaks, and ’tis such sense\r\nThat my sense breeds with it. [_Going_.]\r\nFare you well.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nGentle my lord, turn back.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nI will bethink me. Come again tomorrow.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nHark how I’ll bribe you. Good my lord, turn back.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nHow? Bribe me?\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nAy, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nYou had marred all else.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nNot with fond shekels of the tested gold,\r\nOr stones, whose rates are either rich or poor\r\nAs fancy values them, but with true prayers,\r\nThat shall be up at heaven and enter there\r\nEre sunrise, prayers from preserved souls,\r\nFrom fasting maids, whose minds are dedicate\r\nTo nothing temporal.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nWell; come to me tomorrow.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\n[_Aside to Isabella_.] Go to, ’tis well; away.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nHeaven keep your honour safe.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\n[_Aside_.] Amen.\r\nFor I am that way going to temptation,\r\nWhere prayers cross.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nAt what hour tomorrow\r\nShall I attend your lordship?\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nAt any time ’fore noon.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nSave your honour.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Isabella, Lucio and Provost._]\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nFrom thee, even from thy virtue!\r\nWhat’s this? What’s this? Is this her fault or mine?\r\nThe tempter or the tempted, who sins most, ha?\r\nNot she; nor doth she tempt; but it is I\r\nThat, lying by the violet in the sun,\r\nDo as the carrion does, not as the flower,\r\nCorrupt with virtuous season. Can it be\r\nThat modesty may more betray our sense\r\nThan woman’s lightness? Having waste ground enough,\r\nShall we desire to raze the sanctuary\r\nAnd pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!\r\nWhat dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?\r\nDost thou desire her foully for those things\r\nThat make her good? O, let her brother live.\r\nThieves for their robbery have authority\r\nWhen judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,\r\nThat I desire to hear her speak again\r\nAnd feast upon her eyes? What is’t I dream on?\r\nO cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,\r\nWith saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous\r\nIs that temptation that doth goad us on\r\nTo sin in loving virtue. Never could the strumpet\r\nWith all her double vigour, art, and nature,\r\nOnce stir my temper, but this virtuous maid\r\nSubdues me quite. Ever till now\r\nWhen men were fond, I smiled and wondered how.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. A room in a prison.\r\n\r\nEnter Duke disguised as a Friar, and Provost.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nHail to you, Provost, so I think you are.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nI am the Provost. What’s your will, good friar?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nBound by my charity and my blessed order,\r\nI come to visit the afflicted spirits\r\nHere in the prison. Do me the common right\r\nTo let me see them, and to make me know\r\nThe nature of their crimes, that I may minister\r\nTo them accordingly.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nI would do more than that, if more were needful.\r\n\r\nEnter Juliet.\r\n\r\nLook, here comes one, a gentlewoman of mine,\r\nWho, falling in the flaws of her own youth,\r\nHath blistered her report. She is with child,\r\nAnd he that got it, sentenced: a young man\r\nMore fit to do another such offence\r\nThan die for this.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWhen must he die?\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nAs I do think, tomorrow.\r\n[_To Juliet_.] I have provided for you; stay a while\r\nAnd you shall be conducted.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nRepent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nI do; and bear the shame most patiently.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nI’ll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,\r\nAnd try your penitence, if it be sound\r\nOr hollowly put on.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nI’ll gladly learn.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nLove you the man that wronged you?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nYes, as I love the woman that wronged him.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nSo then it seems your most offenceful act\r\nWas mutually committed?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nMutually.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThen was your sin of heavier kind than his.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nI do confess it, and repent it, father.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\n’Tis meet so, daughter; but lest you do repent\r\nAs that the sin hath brought you to this shame,\r\nWhich sorrow is always toward ourselves, not heaven,\r\nShowing we would not spare heaven as we love it,\r\nBut as we stand in fear—\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nI do repent me as it is an evil,\r\nAnd take the shame with joy.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThere rest.\r\nYour partner, as I hear, must die tomorrow,\r\nAnd I am going with instruction to him.\r\nGrace go with you! _Benedicite!_\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nMust die tomorrow? O, injurious love\r\nThat respites me a life, whose very comfort\r\nIs still a dying horror!\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\n’Tis pity of him.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV. A room in Angelo’s house.\r\n\r\nEnter Angelo.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nWhen I would pray and think, I think and pray\r\nTo several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words,\r\nWhilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,\r\nAnchors on Isabel. Heaven in my mouth,\r\nAs if I did but only chew his name,\r\nAnd in my heart the strong and swelling evil\r\nOf my conception. The state whereon I studied\r\nIs, like a good thing being often read,\r\nGrown sere and tedious; yea, my gravity,\r\nWherein—let no man hear me—I take pride,\r\nCould I with boot change for an idle plume\r\nWhich the air beats for vain. O place, O form,\r\nHow often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,\r\nWrench awe from fools, and tie the wiser souls\r\nTo thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood.\r\nLet’s write good angel on the devil’s horn.\r\n’Tis not the devil’s crest.\r\n\r\n[_Knock within._]\r\n\r\nHow now, who’s there?\r\n\r\nEnter Servant.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nOne Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nTeach her the way.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Servant._]\r\n\r\nO heavens,\r\nWhy does my blood thus muster to my heart,\r\nMaking both it unable for itself\r\nAnd dispossessing all my other parts\r\nOf necessary fitness?\r\nSo play the foolish throngs with one that swoons,\r\nCome all to help him, and so stop the air\r\nBy which he should revive. And even so\r\nThe general subject to a well-wished king\r\nQuit their own part, and in obsequious fondness\r\nCrowd to his presence, where their untaught love\r\nMust needs appear offence.\r\n\r\nEnter Isabella.\r\n\r\nHow now, fair maid?\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nI am come to know your pleasure.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nThat you might know it, would much better please me\r\nThan to demand what ’tis. Your brother cannot live.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nEven so. Heaven keep your honour.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nYet may he live a while. And, it may be,\r\nAs long as you or I. Yet he must die.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nUnder your sentence?\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nYea.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nWhen, I beseech you? That in his reprieve,\r\nLonger or shorter, he may be so fitted\r\nThat his soul sicken not.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nHa! Fie, these filthy vices! It were as good\r\nTo pardon him that hath from nature stolen\r\nA man already made, as to remit\r\nTheir saucy sweetness that do coin heaven’s image\r\nIn stamps that are forbid. ’Tis all as easy\r\nFalsely to take away a life true made\r\nAs to put metal in restrained means\r\nTo make a false one.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\n’Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nSay you so? Then I shall pose you quickly.\r\nWhich had you rather, that the most just law\r\nNow took your brother’s life; or, to redeem him,\r\nGive up your body to such sweet uncleanness\r\nAs she that he hath stained?\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nSir, believe this:\r\nI had rather give my body than my soul.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nI talk not of your soul. Our compelled sins\r\nStand more for number than for accompt.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nHow say you?\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nNay, I’ll not warrant that, for I can speak\r\nAgainst the thing I say. Answer to this:\r\nI, now the voice of the recorded law,\r\nPronounce a sentence on your brother’s life.\r\nMight there not be a charity in sin\r\nTo save this brother’s life?\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nPlease you to do’t,\r\nI’ll take it as a peril to my soul;\r\nIt is no sin at all, but charity.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nPleased you to do’t at peril of your soul,\r\nWere equal poise of sin and charity.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nThat I do beg his life, if it be sin,\r\nHeaven let me bear it. You granting of my suit,\r\nIf that be sin, I’ll make it my morn prayer\r\nTo have it added to the faults of mine,\r\nAnd nothing of your answer.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nNay, but hear me.\r\nYour sense pursues not mine. Either you are ignorant,\r\nOr seem so, crafty; and that’s not good.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nLet me be ignorant, and in nothing good,\r\nBut graciously to know I am no better.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nThus wisdom wishes to appear most bright\r\nWhen it doth tax itself, as these black masks\r\nProclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder\r\nThan beauty could, displayed. But mark me;\r\nTo be received plain, I’ll speak more gross.\r\nYour brother is to die.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nSo.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nAnd his offence is so, as it appears,\r\nAccountant to the law upon that pain.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nTrue.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nAdmit no other way to save his life—\r\nAs I subscribe not that, nor any other,\r\nBut, in the loss of question, that you, his sister,\r\nFinding yourself desired of such a person\r\nWhose credit with the judge, or own great place,\r\nCould fetch your brother from the manacles\r\nOf the all-binding law; and that there were\r\nNo earthly mean to save him but that either\r\nYou must lay down the treasures of your body\r\nTo this supposed, or else to let him suffer,\r\nWhat would you do?\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nAs much for my poor brother as myself.\r\nThat is, were I under the terms of death,\r\nTh’ impression of keen whips I’d wear as rubies,\r\nAnd strip myself to death as to a bed\r\nThat longing have been sick for, ere I’d yield\r\nMy body up to shame.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nThen must your brother die.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nAnd ’twere the cheaper way.\r\nBetter it were a brother died at once\r\nThan that a sister, by redeeming him,\r\nShould die for ever.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nWere not you then as cruel as the sentence\r\nThat you have slandered so?\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nIgnominy in ransom and free pardon\r\nAre of two houses. Lawful mercy\r\nIs nothing kin to foul redemption.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nYou seemed of late to make the law a tyrant,\r\nAnd rather proved the sliding of your brother\r\nA merriment than a vice.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nO, pardon me, my lord. It oft falls out,\r\nTo have what we would have, we speak not what we mean.\r\nI something do excuse the thing I hate\r\nFor his advantage that I dearly love.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nWe are all frail.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nElse let my brother die,\r\nIf not a feodary but only he\r\nOwe and succeed by weakness.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nNay, women are frail too.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nAy, as the glasses where they view themselves,\r\nWhich are as easy broke as they make forms.\r\nWomen?—Help, heaven! Men their creation mar\r\nIn profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;\r\nFor we are soft as our complexions are,\r\nAnd credulous to false prints.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nI think it well.\r\nAnd from this testimony of your own sex,\r\nSince I suppose we are made to be no stronger\r\nThan faults may shake our frames, let me be bold.\r\nI do arrest your words. Be that you are,\r\nThat is, a woman. If you be more, you’re none.\r\nIf you be one, as you are well expressed\r\nBy all external warrants, show it now\r\nBy putting on the destined livery.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nI have no tongue but one. Gentle my lord,\r\nLet me intreat you speak the former language.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nPlainly conceive, I love you.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nMy brother did love Juliet,\r\nAnd you tell me that he shall die for ’t.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nHe shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nI know your virtue hath a license in’t,\r\nWhich seems a little fouler than it is,\r\nTo pluck on others.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nBelieve me, on mine honour,\r\nMy words express my purpose.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nHa! Little honour to be much believed,\r\nAnd most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!\r\nI will proclaim thee, Angelo, look for’t.\r\nSign me a present pardon for my brother\r\nOr with an outstretched throat I’ll tell the world aloud\r\nWhat man thou art.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nWho will believe thee, Isabel?\r\nMy unsoiled name, th’ austereness of my life,\r\nMy vouch against you, and my place i’ th’ state\r\nWill so your accusation overweigh\r\nThat you shall stifle in your own report,\r\nAnd smell of calumny. I have begun,\r\nAnd now I give my sensual race the rein.\r\nFit thy consent to my sharp appetite;\r\nLay by all nicety and prolixious blushes\r\nThat banish what they sue for. Redeem thy brother\r\nBy yielding up thy body to my will;\r\nOr else he must not only die the death,\r\nBut thy unkindness shall his death draw out\r\nTo ling’ring sufferance. Answer me tomorrow,\r\nOr, by the affection that now guides me most,\r\nI’ll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,\r\nSay what you can, my false o’erweighs your true.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nTo whom should I complain? Did I tell this,\r\nWho would believe me? O perilous mouths,\r\nThat bear in them one and the self-same tongue\r\nEither of condemnation or approof,\r\nBidding the law make curtsy to their will,\r\nHooking both right and wrong to th’ appetite,\r\nTo follow as it draws! I’ll to my brother.\r\nThough he hath fall’n by prompture of the blood,\r\nYet hath he in him such a mind of honour\r\nThat, had he twenty heads to tender down\r\nOn twenty bloody blocks, he’d yield them up\r\nBefore his sister should her body stoop\r\nTo such abhorred pollution.\r\nThen, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die.\r\nMore than our brother is our chastity.\r\nI’ll tell him yet of Angelo’s request,\r\nAnd fit his mind to death, for his soul’s rest.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\nACT III\r\n\r\nSCENE I. A room in the prison.\r\n\nEnter Duke, Claudio and Provost.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nSo then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nThe miserable have no other medicine\r\nBut only hope.\r\nI have hope to live, and am prepared to die.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nBe absolute for death. Either death or life\r\nShall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:\r\nIf I do lose thee, I do lose a thing\r\nThat none but fools would keep. A breath thou art,\r\nServile to all the skyey influences\r\nThat dost this habitation where thou keep’st\r\nHourly afflict. Merely, thou art death’s fool;\r\nFor him thou labour’st by thy flight to shun,\r\nAnd yet runn’st toward him still. Thou art not noble;\r\nFor all th’ accommodations that thou bear’st\r\nAre nursed by baseness. Thou’rt by no means valiant;\r\nFor thou dost fear the soft and tender fork\r\nOf a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,\r\nAnd that thou oft provok’st, yet grossly fear’st\r\nThy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;\r\nFor thou exists on many a thousand grains\r\nThat issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;\r\nFor what thou hast not, still thou striv’st to get,\r\nAnd what thou hast, forget’st. Thou art not certain;\r\nFor thy complexion shifts to strange effects\r\nAfter the moon. If thou art rich, thou’rt poor;\r\nFor, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,\r\nThou bear’st thy heavy riches but a journey,\r\nAnd death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;\r\nFor thine own bowels which do call thee sire,\r\nThe mere effusion of thy proper loins,\r\nDo curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum\r\nFor ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,\r\nBut as it were an after-dinner’s sleep\r\nDreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth\r\nBecomes as aged, and doth beg the alms\r\nOf palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,\r\nThou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty\r\nTo make thy riches pleasant. What’s yet in this\r\nThat bears the name of life? Yet in this life\r\nLie hid more thousand deaths; yet death we fear,\r\nThat makes these odds all even.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nI humbly thank you.\r\nTo sue to live, I find I seek to die,\r\nAnd seeking death, find life. Let it come on.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\n[_Within_.] What ho! Peace here; grace and good company!\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nWho’s there? Come in. The wish deserves a welcome.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nDear sir, ere long I’ll visit you again.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nMost holy sir, I thank you.\r\n\r\nEnter Isabella.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nMy business is a word or two with Claudio.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nAnd very welcome. Look, signior, here’s your sister.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nProvost, a word with you.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nAs many as you please.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nBring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Duke and Provost._]\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nNow, sister, what’s the comfort?\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nWhy,\r\nAs all comforts are, most good, most good indeed.\r\nLord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,\r\nIntends you for his swift ambassador,\r\nWhere you shall be an everlasting leiger.\r\nTherefore your best appointment make with speed;\r\nTomorrow you set on.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nIs there no remedy?\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nNone, but such remedy as, to save a head,\r\nTo cleave a heart in twain.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nBut is there any?\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nYes, brother, you may live.\r\nThere is a devilish mercy in the judge,\r\nIf you’ll implore it, that will free your life,\r\nBut fetter you till death.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nPerpetual durance?\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nAy, just; perpetual durance; a restraint,\r\nThough all the world’s vastidity you had,\r\nTo a determined scope.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nBut in what nature?\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nIn such a one as, you consenting to’t,\r\nWould bark your honour from that trunk you bear,\r\nAnd leave you naked.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nLet me know the point.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nO, I do fear thee, Claudio, and I quake,\r\nLest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,\r\nAnd six or seven winters more respect\r\nThan a perpetual honour. Dar’st thou die?\r\nThe sense of death is most in apprehension;\r\nAnd the poor beetle that we tread upon\r\nIn corporal sufferance finds a pang as great\r\nAs when a giant dies.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nWhy give you me this shame?\r\nThink you I can a resolution fetch\r\nFrom flowery tenderness? If I must die,\r\nI will encounter darkness as a bride\r\nAnd hug it in mine arms.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nThere spake my brother! There my father’s grave\r\nDid utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die.\r\nThou art too noble to conserve a life\r\nIn base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,\r\nWhose settled visage and deliberate word\r\nNips youth i’ th’ head, and follies doth enew\r\nAs falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil.\r\nHis filth within being cast, he would appear\r\nA pond as deep as hell.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nThe precise Angelo?\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nO, ’tis the cunning livery of hell\r\nThe damned’st body to invest and cover\r\nIn precise guards! Dost thou think, Claudio,\r\nIf I would yield him my virginity\r\nThou mightst be freed?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nO heavens, it cannot be.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nYes, he would give it thee, from this rank offence,\r\nSo to offend him still. This night’s the time\r\nThat I should do what I abhor to name,\r\nOr else thou diest tomorrow.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nThou shalt not do’t.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nO, were it but my life,\r\nI’d throw it down for your deliverance\r\nAs frankly as a pin.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nThanks, dear Isabel.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nBe ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nYes. Has he affections in him\r\nThat thus can make him bite the law by th’ nose\r\nWhen he would force it? Sure it is no sin;\r\nOr of the deadly seven it is the least.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nWhich is the least?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nIf it were damnable, he being so wise,\r\nWhy would he for the momentary trick\r\nBe perdurably fined? O Isabel!\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nWhat says my brother?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nDeath is a fearful thing.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nAnd shamed life a hateful.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nAy, but to die, and go we know not where;\r\nTo lie in cold obstruction, and to rot;\r\nThis sensible warm motion to become\r\nA kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit\r\nTo bathe in fiery floods, or to reside\r\nIn thrilling regions of thick-ribbed ice;\r\nTo be imprisoned in the viewless winds\r\nAnd blown with restless violence round about\r\nThe pendent world; or to be worse than worst\r\nOf those that lawless and incertain thought\r\nImagine howling—’tis too horrible.\r\nThe weariest and most loathed worldly life\r\nThat age, ache, penury, and imprisonment\r\nCan lay on nature is a paradise\r\nTo what we fear of death.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nAlas, alas!\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nSweet sister, let me live.\r\nWhat sin you do to save a brother’s life,\r\nNature dispenses with the deed so far\r\nThat it becomes a virtue.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nO, you beast!\r\nO faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!\r\nWilt thou be made a man out of my vice?\r\nIs’t not a kind of incest to take life\r\nFrom thine own sister’s shame? What should I think?\r\nHeaven shield my mother played my father fair,\r\nFor such a warped slip of wilderness\r\nNe’er issued from his blood. Take my defiance,\r\nDie, perish! Might but my bending down\r\nReprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed.\r\nI’ll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,\r\nNo word to save thee.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nNay, hear me, Isabel.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nO fie, fie, fie!\r\nThy sin’s not accidental, but a trade.\r\nMercy to thee would prove itself a bawd.\r\n’Tis best that thou diest quickly.\r\n\r\n[_Going._]\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nO, hear me, Isabella.\r\n\r\nEnter Duke as a Friar.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nVouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nWhat is your will?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nMight you dispense with your leisure, I would by and by have some\r\nspeech with you. The satisfaction I would require is likewise your own\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nI have no superfluous leisure, my stay must be stolen out of other\r\naffairs, but I will attend you a while.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\n[_To Claudio aside_.] Son, I have overheard what hath passed between\r\nyou and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her; only\r\nhe hath made an assay of her virtue, to practise his judgement with the\r\ndisposition of natures. She, having the truth of honour in her, hath\r\nmade him that gracious denial which he is most glad to receive. I am\r\nconfessor to Angelo, and I know this to be true; therefore prepare\r\nyourself to death. Do not satisfy your resolution with hopes that are\r\nfallible. Tomorrow you must die; go to your knees and make ready.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nLet me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love with life that I will\r\nsue to be rid of it.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nHold you there. Farewell.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Claudio._]\r\n\r\nEnter Provost.\r\n\r\nProvost, a word with you.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nWhat’s your will, father?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThat, now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me a while with the\r\nmaid; my mind promises with my habit no loss shall touch her by my\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nIn good time.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Provost._]\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThe hand that hath made you fair hath made you good. The goodness that\r\nis cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness; but grace, being the\r\nsoul of your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever fair. The\r\nassault that Angelo hath made to you, fortune hath conveyed to my\r\nunderstanding; and, but that frailty hath examples for his falling, I\r\nshould wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this substitute,\r\nand to save your brother?\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nI am now going to resolve him. I had rather my brother die by the law\r\nthan my son should be unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good\r\nDuke deceived in Angelo! If ever he return, and I can speak to him, I\r\nwill open my lips in vain, or discover his government.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThat shall not be much amiss. Yet, as the matter now stands, he will\r\navoid your accusation: he made trial of you only. Therefore fasten your\r\near on my advisings, to the love I have in doing good, a remedy\r\npresents itself. I do make myself believe that you may most\r\nuprighteously do a poor wronged lady a merited benefit; redeem your\r\nbrother from the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious person;\r\nand much please the absent Duke, if peradventure he shall ever return\r\nto have hearing of this business.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nLet me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do anything that\r\nappears not foul in the truth of my spirit.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nVirtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have you not heard speak of\r\nMariana, the sister of Frederick, the great soldier who miscarried at\r\nsea?\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nI have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nShe should this Angelo have married, was affianced to her oath, and the\r\nnuptial appointed. Between which time of the contract and limit of the\r\nsolemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea, having in that\r\nperished vessel the dowry of his sister. But mark how heavily this\r\nbefell to the poor gentlewoman. There she lost a noble and renowned\r\nbrother, in his love toward her ever most kind and natural; with him,\r\nthe portion and sinew of her fortune, her marriage dowry; with both,\r\nher combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nCan this be so? Did Angelo so leave her?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nLeft her in her tears, and dried not one of them with his comfort,\r\nswallowed his vows whole, pretending in her discoveries of dishonour;\r\nin few, bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet wears for\r\nhis sake; and he, a marble to her tears, is washed with them, but\r\nrelents not.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nWhat a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from the world!\r\nWhat corruption in this life, that it will let this man live! But how\r\nout of this can she avail?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nIt is a rupture that you may easily heal, and the cure of it not only\r\nsaves your brother, but keeps you from dishonour in doing it.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nShow me how, good father.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThis forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her first\r\naffection. His unjust unkindness, that in all reason should have\r\nquenched her love, hath, like an impediment in the current, made it\r\nmore violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his requiring with a\r\nplausible obedience; agree with his demands to the point. Only refer\r\nyourself to this advantage: first, that your stay with him may not be\r\nlong; that the time may have all shadow and silence in it; and the\r\nplace answer to convenience. This being granted in course, and now\r\nfollows all. We shall advise this wronged maid to stead up your\r\nappointment, go in your place. If the encounter acknowledge itself\r\nhereafter, it may compel him to her recompense; and here, by this, is\r\nyour brother saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana advantaged,\r\nand the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid will I frame and make fit for\r\nhis attempt. If you think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness\r\nof the benefit defends the deceit from reproof. What think you of it?\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nThe image of it gives me content already, and I trust it will grow to a\r\nmost prosperous perfection.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nIt lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily to Angelo; if for\r\nthis night he entreat you to his bed, give him promise of satisfaction.\r\nI will presently to Saint Luke’s; there at the moated grange resides\r\nthis dejected Mariana. At that place call upon me; and dispatch with\r\nAngelo, that it may be quickly.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nI thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Isabella._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. The street before the prison.\r\n\r\nEnter Elbow, Pompey and Officers.\r\n\r\nELBOW.\r\nNay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will needs buy and sell\r\nmen and women like beasts, we shall have all the world drink brown and\r\nwhite bastard.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nO heavens, what stuff is here?\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\n’Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the merriest was put\r\ndown, and the worser allowed by order of law a furred gown to keep him\r\nwarm; and furred with fox on lambskins too, to signify that craft,\r\nbeing richer than innocency, stands for the facing.\r\n\r\nELBOW.\r\nCome your way, sir.—Bless you, good father friar.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nAnd you, good brother father. What offence hath this man made you, sir?\r\n\r\nELBOW.\r\nMarry, sir, he hath offended the law; and, sir, we take him to be a\r\nthief too, sir; for we have found upon him, sir, a strange picklock,\r\nwhich we have sent to the deputy.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nFie, sirrah, a bawd, a wicked bawd;\r\nThe evil that thou causest to be done,\r\nThat is thy means to live. Do thou but think\r\nWhat ’tis to cram a maw or clothe a back\r\nFrom such a filthy vice. Say to thyself,\r\nFrom their abominable and beastly touches\r\nI drink, I eat, array myself, and live.\r\nCanst thou believe thy living is a life,\r\nSo stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nIndeed, it does stink in some sort, sir. But yet, sir, I would prove—\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nNay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,\r\nThou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer.\r\nCorrection and instruction must both work\r\nEre this rude beast will profit.\r\n\r\nELBOW.\r\nHe must before the deputy, sir; he has given him warning. The deputy\r\ncannot abide a whoremaster. If he be a whoremonger and comes before\r\nhim, he were as good go a mile on his errand.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThat we were all, as some would seem to be,\r\nFree from our faults, as faults from seeming, free!\r\n\r\nELBOW.\r\nHis neck will come to your waist—a cord, sir.\r\n\r\nEnter Lucio.\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nI spy comfort, I cry bail! Here’s a gentleman, and a friend of mine.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nHow now, noble Pompey? What, at the wheels of Caesar? Art thou led in\r\ntriumph? What, is there none of Pygmalion’s images, newly made woman,\r\nto be had now, for putting the hand in the pocket and extracting it\r\nclutched? What reply, ha? What say’st thou to this tune, matter, and\r\nmethod? Is’t not drowned i’ th’ last rain, ha? What say’st thou, trot?\r\nIs the world as it was, man? Which is the way? Is it sad and few words?\r\nOr how? The trick of it?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nStill thus, and thus; still worse!\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nHow doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she still, ha?\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nTroth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she is herself in the\r\ntub.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nWhy, ’tis good. It is the right of it. It must be so. Ever your fresh\r\nwhore and your powdered bawd; an unshunned consequence; it must be so.\r\nArt going to prison, Pompey?\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nYes, faith, sir.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nWhy, ’tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell. Go, say I sent thee thither. For\r\ndebt, Pompey? Or how?\r\n\r\nELBOW.\r\nFor being a bawd, for being a bawd.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nWell, then, imprison him. If imprisonment be the due of a bawd, why,\r\n’tis his right. Bawd is he doubtless, and of antiquity, too. Bawd born.\r\nFarewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison, Pompey. You will turn\r\ngood husband now, Pompey; you will keep the house.\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nI hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nNo, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear. I will pray,\r\nPompey, to increase your bondage. If you take it not patiently, why,\r\nyour mettle is the more. Adieu, trusty Pompey.—Bless you, friar.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nAnd you.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nDoes Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?\r\n\r\nELBOW.\r\nCome your ways, sir, come.\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nYou will not bail me then, sir?\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nThen, Pompey, nor now.—What news abroad, friar? What news?\r\n\r\nELBOW.\r\nCome your ways, sir, come.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nGo to kennel, Pompey, go.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Elbow, Pompey and Officers._]\r\n\r\nWhat news, friar, of the Duke?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nI know none. Can you tell me of any?\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nSome say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other some, he is in Rome.\r\nBut where is he, think you?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nI know not where, but wheresoever, I wish him well.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nIt was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the state and usurp\r\nthe beggary he was never born to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his\r\nabsence. He puts transgression to’t.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nHe does well in’t.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nA little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him. Something too\r\ncrabbed that way, friar.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nIt is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nYes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred; it is well allied;\r\nbut it is impossible to extirp it quite, friar, till eating and\r\ndrinking be put down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and\r\nwoman after this downright way of creation. Is it true, think you?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nHow should he be made, then?\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nSome report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that he was begot between two\r\nstockfishes. But it is certain that when he makes water, his urine is\r\ncongealed ice; that I know to be true. And he is a motion ungenerative;\r\nthat’s infallible.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nYou are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nWhy, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the rebellion of a\r\ncodpiece to take away the life of a man! Would the Duke that is absent\r\nhave done this? Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a\r\nhundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing a thousand. He had\r\nsome feeling of the sport; he knew the service, and that instructed him\r\nto mercy.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nI never heard the absent Duke much detected for women; he was not\r\ninclined that way.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nO, sir, you are deceived.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\n’Tis not possible.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nWho, not the Duke? Yes, your beggar of fifty; and his use was to put a\r\nducat in her clack-dish. The Duke had crotchets in him. He would be\r\ndrunk too, that let me inform you.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nYou do him wrong, surely.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nSir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the Duke; and I believe I\r\nknow the cause of his withdrawing.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWhat, I prithee, might be the cause?\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nNo, pardon. ’Tis a secret must be locked within the teeth and the lips.\r\nBut this I can let you understand: the greater file of the subject held\r\nthe Duke to be wise.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWise? Why, no question but he was.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nA very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nEither this is envy in you, folly, or mistaking. The very stream of his\r\nlife, and the business he hath helmed, must upon a warranted need give\r\nhim a better proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own\r\nbringings-forth, and he shall appear to the envious a scholar, a\r\nstatesman, and a soldier. Therefore you speak unskilfully. Or, if your\r\nknowledge be more, it is much darkened in your malice.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nSir, I know him, and I love him.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nLove talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with dearer love.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nCome, sir, I know what I know.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nI can hardly believe that, since you know not what you speak. But, if\r\never the Duke return, as our prayers are he may, let me desire you to\r\nmake your answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke, you have\r\ncourage to maintain it. I am bound to call upon you, and I pray you\r\nyour name?\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nSir, my name is Lucio, well known to the Duke.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nHe shall know you better, sir, if I may live to report you.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nI fear you not.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nO, you hope the Duke will return no more; or you imagine me too\r\nunhurtful an opposite. But indeed, I can do you little harm. You’ll\r\nforswear this again.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nI’ll be hanged first! Thou art deceived in me, friar. But no more of\r\nthis. Canst thou tell if Claudio die tomorrow or no?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWhy should he die, sir?\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nWhy? For filling a bottle with a tun-dish. I would the Duke we talk of\r\nwere returned again. This ungenitured agent will unpeople the province\r\nwith continency. Sparrows must not build in his house-eaves because\r\nthey are lecherous. The Duke yet would have dark deeds darkly answered.\r\nHe would never bring them to light. Would he were returned! Marry, this\r\nClaudio is condemned for untrussing. Farewell, good friar, I prithee\r\npray for me. The Duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on\r\nFridays. He’s now past it; yet, and, I say to thee, he would mouth with\r\na beggar though she smelt brown bread and garlic. Say that I said so.\r\nFarewell.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nNo might nor greatness in mortality\r\nCan censure ’scape. Back-wounding calumny\r\nThe whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong\r\nCan tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?\r\nBut who comes here?\r\n\r\nEnter Escalus, Provost and Officers with Mistress Overdone, a Bawd.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nGo, away with her to prison.\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nGood my lord, be good to me. Your honour is accounted a merciful man,\r\ngood my lord.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nDouble and treble admonition, and still forfeit in the same kind? This\r\nwould make mercy swear and play the tyrant.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nA bawd of eleven years’ continuance, may it please your honour.\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nMy lord, this is one Lucio’s information against me. Mistress Kate\r\nKeepdown was with child by him in the Duke’s time; he promised her\r\nmarriage. His child is a year and a quarter old come Philip and Jacob.\r\nI have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nThat fellow is a fellow of much license. Let him be called before us.\r\nAway with her to prison. Go to, no more words.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Officers with Bawd._]\r\n\r\nProvost, my brother Angelo will not be altered; Claudio must die\r\ntomorrow. Let him be furnished with divines, and have all charitable\r\npreparation. If my brother wrought by my pity, it should not be so with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nSo please you, this friar hath been with him, and advised him for th’\r\nentertainment of death.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nGood even, good father.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nBliss and goodness on you!\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nOf whence are you?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nNot of this country, though my chance is now\r\nTo use it for my time. I am a brother\r\nOf gracious order, late come from the See\r\nIn special business from his Holiness.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nWhat news abroad i’ th’ world?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nNone, but that there is so great a fever on goodness that the\r\ndissolution of it must cure it. Novelty is only in request, and as it\r\nis as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course as it is virtuous to\r\nbe constant in any undertaking. There is scarce truth enough alive to\r\nmake societies secure; but security enough to make fellowships\r\naccursed. Much upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This news\r\nis old enough, yet it is every day’s news. I pray you, sir, of what\r\ndisposition was the Duke?\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nOne that, above all other strifes, contended especially to know\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWhat pleasure was he given to?\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nRather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at anything which\r\nprofessed to make him rejoice. A gentleman of all temperance. But leave\r\nwe him to his events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous, and let\r\nme desire to know how you find Claudio prepared. I am made to\r\nunderstand that you have lent him visitation.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nHe professes to have received no sinister measure from his judge, but\r\nmost willingly humbles himself to the determination of justice. Yet had\r\nhe framed to himself, by the instruction of his frailty, many deceiving\r\npromises of life, which I, by my good leisure, have discredited to him,\r\nand now he is resolved to die.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nYou have paid the heavens your function, and the prisoner the very debt\r\nof your calling. I have laboured for the poor gentleman to the\r\nextremest shore of my modesty, but my brother justice have I found so\r\nsevere that he hath forced me to tell him he is indeed Justice.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nIf his own life answer the straitness of his proceeding, it shall\r\nbecome him well; wherein if he chance to fail, he hath sentenced\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nI am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nPeace be with you.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Escalus and Provost._]\r\n\r\nHe who the sword of heaven will bear\r\nShould be as holy as severe,\r\nPattern in himself to know,\r\nGrace to stand, and virtue go;\r\nMore nor less to others paying\r\nThan by self-offences weighing.\r\nShame to him whose cruel striking\r\nKills for faults of his own liking!\r\nTwice treble shame on Angelo,\r\nTo weed my vice, and let his grow!\r\nO, what may man within him hide,\r\nThough angel on the outward side!\r\nHow may likeness, made in crimes,\r\nMake practice on the times,\r\nTo draw with idle spiders’ strings\r\nMost ponderous and substantial things!\r\nCraft against vice I must apply.\r\nWith Angelo tonight shall lie\r\nHis old betrothed but despised.\r\nSo disguise shall, by th’ disguised,\r\nPay with falsehood false exacting,\r\nAnd perform an old contracting.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\nACT IV\r\n\r\nSCENE I.

Much upon\r\nthis time have I promised here to meet.\r\n\r\nMARIANA.\r\nYou have not been inquired after. I have sat here all day.\r\n\r\nEnter Isabella.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nI do constantly believe you.

If\r\nyou think it meet, compound with him by the year, and let him abide\r\nhere with you; if not, use him for the present, and dismiss him. He\r\ncannot plead his estimation with you; he hath been a bawd.\r\n\r\nABHORSON.\r\nA bawd, sir? Fie upon him, he will discredit our mystery.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nGo to, sir; you weigh equally. A feather will turn the scale.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nPray, sir, by your good favour—for surely, sir, a good favour you have,\r\nbut that you have a hanging look—do you call, sir, your occupation a\r\nmystery?\r\n\r\nABHORSON.\r\nAy, sir, a mystery.\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nPainting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery; and your whores, sir,\r\nbeing members of my occupation, using painting, do prove my occupation\r\na mystery. But what mystery there should be in hanging, if I should be\r\nhanged, I cannot imagine.\r\n\r\nABHORSON.\r\nSir, it is a mystery.\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nProof.\r\n\r\nABHORSON.\r\nEvery true man’s apparel fits your thief. If it be too little for your\r\nthief, your true man thinks it big enough; if it be too big for your\r\nthief, your thief thinks it little enough. So every true man’s apparel\r\nfits your thief.\r\n\r\nEnter Provost.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nAre you agreed?\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nSir, I will serve him; for I do find your hangman is a more penitent\r\ntrade than your bawd. He doth oftener ask forgiveness.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nYou, sirrah, provide your block and your axe tomorrow four o’clock.\r\n\r\nABHORSON.\r\nCome on, bawd. I will instruct thee in my trade. Follow.\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nI do desire to learn, sir; and I hope, if you have occasion to use me\r\nfor your own turn, you shall find me yare. For truly, sir, for your\r\nkindness I owe you a good turn.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nCall hither Barnardine and Claudio.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Abhorson and Pompey._]\r\n\r\nTh’ one has my pity; not a jot the other,\r\nBeing a murderer, though he were my brother.\r\n\r\nEnter Claudio.\r\n\r\nLook, here’s the warrant, Claudio, for thy death.\r\n’Tis now dead midnight, and by eight tomorrow\r\nThou must be made immortal. Where’s Barnardine?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nAs fast locked up in sleep as guiltless labour\r\nWhen it lies starkly in the traveller’s bones.\r\nHe will not wake.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nWho can do good on him?\r\nWell, go, prepare yourself. [_Knocking within_.] But hark, what noise?\r\nHeaven give your spirits comfort!\r\n\r\n[_Exit Claudio. Knock within._]\r\n\r\nBy and by!—\r\nI hope it is some pardon or reprieve\r\nFor the most gentle Claudio.\r\n\r\nEnter Duke.\r\n\r\nWelcome, father.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThe best and wholesom’st spirits of the night\r\nEnvelop you, good Provost! Who called here of late?\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nNone, since the curfew rung.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nNot Isabel?\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThey will then, ere’t be long.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nWhat comfort is for Claudio?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThere’s some in hope.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nIt is a bitter deputy.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nNot so, not so. His life is paralleled\r\nEven with the stroke and line of his great justice.\r\nHe doth with holy abstinence subdue\r\nThat in himself which he spurs on his power\r\nTo qualify in others. Were he mealed with that\r\nWhich he corrects, then were he tyrannous;\r\nBut this being so, he’s just.\r\n\r\n[_Knocking within. Provost goes to the door._]\r\n\r\nNow are they come.\r\nThis is a gentle provost. Seldom when\r\nThe steeled gaoler is the friend of men.\r\n\r\n[_Knocking within_.]\r\n\r\nHow now? What noise? That spirit’s possessed with haste\r\nThat wounds th’ unsisting postern with these strokes.\r\n\r\nProvost returns.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nThere he must stay until the officer\r\nArise to let him in. He is called up.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nHave you no countermand for Claudio yet,\r\nBut he must die tomorrow?\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nNone, sir, none.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nAs near the dawning, Provost, as it is,\r\nYou shall hear more ere morning.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nHappily\r\nYou something know, yet I believe there comes\r\nNo countermand. No such example have we.\r\nBesides, upon the very siege of justice\r\nLord Angelo hath to the public ear\r\nProfessed the contrary.\r\n\r\nEnter a Messenger.\r\n\r\nThis is his Lordship’s man.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nAnd here comes Claudio’s pardon.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nMy lord hath sent you this note, and by me this further charge: that\r\nyou swerve not from the smallest article of it, neither in time,\r\nmatter, or other circumstance. Good morrow; for, as I take it, it is\r\nalmost day.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nI shall obey him.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Messenger._]\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\n[_Aside_.] This is his pardon, purchased by such sin\r\nFor which the pardoner himself is in.\r\nHence hath offence his quick celerity,\r\nWhen it is borne in high authority.\r\nWhen vice makes mercy, mercy’s so extended\r\nThat for the fault’s love is th’ offender friended.\r\nNow, sir, what news?\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nI told you: Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss in mine office,\r\nawakens me with this unwonted putting-on; methinks strangely, for he\r\nhath not used it before.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nPray you, let’s hear.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\n[_Reads_.] _Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary, let Claudio be\r\nexecuted by four of the clock, and in the afternoon, Barnardine. For my\r\nbetter satisfaction, let me have Claudio’s head sent me by five. Let\r\nthis be duly performed, with a thought that more depends on it than we\r\nmust yet deliver. Thus fail not to do your office, as you will answer\r\nit at your peril._\r\nWhat say you to this, sir?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWhat is that Barnardine who is to be executed in th’ afternoon?\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nA Bohemian born, but here nursed up and bred; one that is a prisoner\r\nnine years old.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nHow came it that the absent Duke had not either delivered him to his\r\nliberty, or executed him? I have heard it was ever his manner to do so.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nHis friends still wrought reprieves for him; and indeed, his fact till\r\nnow in the government of Lord Angelo, came not to an undoubtful proof.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nIt is now apparent?\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nMost manifest, and not denied by himself.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nHath he borne himself penitently in prison? How seems he to be touched?\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nA man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a drunken sleep;\r\ncareless, reckless, and fearless of what’s past, present, or to come;\r\ninsensible of mortality and desperately mortal.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nHe wants advice.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nHe will hear none. He hath evermore had the liberty of the prison; give\r\nhim leave to escape hence, he would not. Drunk many times a day, if not\r\nmany days entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as if to carry\r\nhim to execution, and showed him a seeming warrant for it. It hath not\r\nmoved him at all.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nMore of him anon. There is written in your brow, Provost, honesty and\r\nconstancy; if I read it not truly, my ancient skill beguiles me. But in\r\nthe boldness of my cunning I will lay myself in hazard. Claudio, whom\r\nhere you have warrant to execute, is no greater forfeit to the law than\r\nAngelo who hath sentenced him. To make you understand this in a\r\nmanifested effect, I crave but four days’ respite, for the which you\r\nare to do me both a present and a dangerous courtesy.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nPray, sir, in what?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nIn the delaying death.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nAlack, how may I do it? Having the hour limited, and an express\r\ncommand, under penalty, to deliver his head in the view of Angelo? I\r\nmay make my case as Claudio’s, to cross this in the smallest.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nBy the vow of mine order, I warrant you, if my instructions may be your\r\nguide. Let this Barnardine be this morning executed, and his head borne\r\nto Angelo.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nAngelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nO, death’s a great disguiser, and you may add to it. Shave the head and\r\ntie the beard, and say it was the desire of the penitent to be so bared\r\nbefore his death. You know the course is common. If anything fall to\r\nyou upon this, more than thanks and good fortune, by the saint whom I\r\nprofess, I will plead against it with my life.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nPardon me, good father; it is against my oath.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWere you sworn to the Duke, or to the Deputy?\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nTo him and to his substitutes.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nYou will think you have made no offence if the Duke avouch the justice\r\nof your dealing?\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nBut what likelihood is in that?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nNot a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see you fearful, that\r\nneither my coat, integrity, nor persuasion, can with ease attempt you,\r\nI will go further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you. Look\r\nyou, sir, here is the hand and seal of the Duke. You know the\r\ncharacter, I doubt not, and the signet is not strange to you.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nI know them both.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThe contents of this is the return of the Duke; you shall anon\r\nover-read it at your pleasure, where you shall find within these two\r\ndays he will be here. This is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he\r\nthis very day receives letters of strange tenour, perchance of the\r\nDuke’s death, perchance entering into some monastery; but, by chance,\r\nnothing of what is writ. Look, th’ unfolding star calls up the\r\nshepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these things should be.\r\nAll difficulties are but easy when they are known. Call your\r\nexecutioner, and off with Barnardine’s head. I will give him a present\r\nshrift, and advise him for a better place. Yet you are amazed; but this\r\nshall absolutely resolve you. Come away; it is almost clear dawn.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. Another room in the same.\r\n\r\nEnter Pompey.\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nI am as well acquainted here as I was in our house of profession. One\r\nwould think it were Mistress Overdone’s own house, for here be many of\r\nher old customers. First, here’s young Master Rash; he’s in for a\r\ncommodity of brown paper and old ginger, nine score and seventeen\r\npounds; of which he made five marks ready money. Marry, then ginger was\r\nnot much in request, for the old women were all dead. Then is there\r\nhere one Master Caper, at the suit of Master Three-pile the mercer, for\r\nsome four suits of peach-coloured satin, which now peaches him a\r\nbeggar. Then have we here young Dizie, and young Master Deep-vow, and\r\nMaster Copperspur, and Master Starve-lackey, the rapier and dagger man,\r\nand young Drop-heir that killed lusty Pudding, and Master Forthright\r\nthe tilter, and brave Master Shoe-tie the great traveller, and wild\r\nHalf-can that stabbed Pots, and I think forty more, all great doers in\r\nour trade, and are now “for the Lord’s sake.”\r\n\r\nEnter Abhorson.\r\n\r\nABHORSON.\r\nSirrah, bring Barnardine hither.\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nMaster Barnardine! You must rise and be hanged, Master Barnardine.\r\n\r\nABHORSON.\r\nWhat ho, Barnardine!\r\n\r\nBARNARDINE.\r\n[_Within_.] A pox o’ your throats! Who makes that noise there? What are\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nYour friends, sir; the hangman. You must be so good, sir, to rise and\r\nbe put to death.\r\n\r\nBARNARDINE.\r\n[_Within_.] Away, you rogue, away; I am sleepy.\r\n\r\nABHORSON.\r\nTell him he must awake, and that quickly too.\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nPray, Master Barnardine, awake till you are executed, and sleep\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nABHORSON.\r\nGo in to him, and fetch him out.\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nHe is coming, sir, he is coming. I hear his straw rustle.\r\n\r\nEnter Barnardine.\r\n\r\nABHORSON.\r\nIs the axe upon the block, sirrah?\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nVery ready, sir.\r\n\r\nBARNARDINE.\r\nHow now, Abhorson? What’s the news with you?\r\n\r\nABHORSON.\r\nTruly, sir, I would desire you to clap into your prayers; for, look\r\nyou, the warrant’s come.\r\n\r\nBARNARDINE.\r\nYou rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am not fitted for’t.\r\n\r\nPOMPEY.\r\nO, the better, sir; for he that drinks all night and is hanged betimes\r\nin the morning may sleep the sounder all the next day.\r\n\r\nEnter Duke.\r\n\r\nABHORSON.\r\nLook you, sir, here comes your ghostly father. Do we jest now, think\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nSir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily you are to depart,\r\nI am come to advise you, comfort you, and pray with you.\r\n\r\nBARNARDINE.\r\nFriar, not I. I have been drinking hard all night, and I will have more\r\ntime to prepare me, or they shall beat out my brains with billets. I\r\nwill not consent to die this day, that’s certain.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nO, sir, you must; and therefore I beseech you\r\nLook forward on the journey you shall go.\r\n\r\nBARNARDINE.\r\nI swear I will not die today for any man’s persuasion.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nBut hear you—\r\n\r\nBARNARDINE.\r\nNot a word. If you have anything to say to me, come to my ward, for\r\nthence will not I today.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nUnfit to live or die. O gravel heart!\r\nAfter him, fellows; bring him to the block.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Abhorson and Pompey._]\r\n\r\nEnter Provost.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nNow, sir, how do you find the prisoner?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nA creature unprepared, unmeet for death;\r\nAnd to transport him in the mind he is\r\nWere damnable.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nHere in the prison, father,\r\nThere died this morning of a cruel fever\r\nOne Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,\r\nA man of Claudio’s years; his beard and head\r\nJust of his colour. What if we do omit\r\nThis reprobate till he were well inclined,\r\nAnd satisfy the Deputy with the visage\r\nOf Ragozine, more like to Claudio?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nO, ’tis an accident that heaven provides!\r\nDispatch it presently; the hour draws on\r\nPrefixed by Angelo. See this be done,\r\nAnd sent according to command, whiles I\r\nPersuade this rude wretch willingly to die.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nThis shall be done, good father, presently.\r\nBut Barnardine must die this afternoon;\r\nAnd how shall we continue Claudio,\r\nTo save me from the danger that might come\r\nIf he were known alive?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nLet this be done:\r\nPut them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio.\r\nEre twice the sun hath made his journal greeting\r\nTo yonder generation, you shall find\r\nYour safety manifested.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nI am your free dependant.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nQuick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Provost._]\r\n\r\nNow will I write letters to Angelo,\r\nThe Provost, he shall bear them, whose contents\r\nShall witness to him I am near at home;\r\nAnd that by great injunctions I am bound\r\nTo enter publicly. Him I’ll desire\r\nTo meet me at the consecrated fount,\r\nA league below the city; and from thence,\r\nBy cold gradation and well-balanced form.\r\nWe shall proceed with Angelo.\r\n\r\nEnter Provost.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nHere is the head; I’ll carry it myself.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nConvenient is it. Make a swift return;\r\nFor I would commune with you of such things\r\nThat want no ear but yours.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nI’ll make all speed.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\n[_Within_.] Peace, ho, be here!\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThe tongue of Isabel. She’s come to know\r\nIf yet her brother’s pardon be come hither.\r\nBut I will keep her ignorant of her good,\r\nTo make her heavenly comforts of despair\r\nWhen it is least expected.\r\n\r\nEnter Isabella.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nHo, by your leave!\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nGood morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nThe better, given me by so holy a man.\r\nHath yet the Deputy sent my brother’s pardon?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nHe hath released him, Isabel, from the world.\r\nHis head is off, and sent to Angelo.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nNay, but it is not so.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nIt is no other.\r\nShow your wisdom, daughter, in your close patience.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nO, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nYou shall not be admitted to his sight.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nUnhappy Claudio! Wretched Isabel!\r\nInjurious world! Most damned Angelo!\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThis nor hurts him nor profits you a jot.\r\nForbear it, therefore; give your cause to heaven.\r\nMark what I say, which you shall find\r\nBy every syllable a faithful verity.\r\nThe Duke comes home tomorrow;—nay, dry your eyes.\r\nOne of our convent, and his confessor,\r\nGives me this instance. Already he hath carried\r\nNotice to Escalus and Angelo,\r\nWho do prepare to meet him at the gates,\r\nThere to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdom\r\nIn that good path that I would wish it go,\r\nAnd you shall have your bosom on this wretch,\r\nGrace of the Duke, revenges to your heart,\r\nAnd general honour.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nI am directed by you.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThis letter, then, to Friar Peter give;\r\n’Tis that he sent me of the Duke’s return.\r\nSay, by this token, I desire his company\r\nAt Mariana’s house tonight. Her cause and yours\r\nI’ll perfect him withal, and he shall bring you\r\nBefore the Duke; and to the head of Angelo\r\nAccuse him home and home. For my poor self,\r\nI am combined by a sacred vow,\r\nAnd shall be absent. Wend you with this letter.\r\nCommand these fretting waters from your eyes\r\nWith a light heart; trust not my holy order,\r\nIf I pervert your course.—Who’s here?\r\n\r\nEnter Lucio.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nGood even. Friar, where is the Provost?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nNot within, sir.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nO pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see thine eyes so red.\r\nThou must be patient. I am fain to dine and sup with water and bran. I\r\ndare not for my head fill my belly. One fruitful meal would set me\r\nto’t. But they say the Duke will be here tomorrow. By my troth, Isabel,\r\nI loved thy brother. If the old fantastical duke of dark corners had\r\nbeen at home, he had lived.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Isabella._]\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nSir, the Duke is marvellous little beholding to your reports; but the\r\nbest is, he lives not in them.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nFriar, thou knowest not the Duke so well as I do. He’s a better woodman\r\nthan thou tak’st him for.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWell, you’ll answer this one day. Fare ye well.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nNay, tarry, I’ll go along with thee. I can tell thee pretty tales of\r\nthe Duke.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nYou have told me too many of him already, sir, if they be true; if not\r\ntrue, none were enough.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nI was once before him for getting a wench with child.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nDid you such a thing?\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nYes, marry, did I; but I was fain to forswear it. They would else have\r\nmarried me to the rotten medlar.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nSir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nBy my troth, I’ll go with thee to the lane’s end. If bawdy talk offend\r\nyou, we’ll have very little of it. Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr; I\r\nshall stick.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV. A room in Angelo’s house.\r\n\r\nEnter Angelo and Escalus.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nEvery letter he hath writ hath disvouched other.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nIn most uneven and distracted manner. His actions show much like to\r\nmadness; pray heaven his wisdom be not tainted. And why meet him at the\r\ngates and redeliver our authorities there?\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nI guess not.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nAnd why should we proclaim it in an hour before his entering, that if\r\nany crave redress of injustice, they should exhibit their petitions in\r\nthe street?\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nHe shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of complaints, and to\r\ndeliver us from devices hereafter, which shall then have no power to\r\nstand against us.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nWell, I beseech you, let it be proclaimed.\r\nBetimes i’ th’ morn I’ll call you at your house.\r\nGive notice to such men of sort and suit\r\nAs are to meet him.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nI shall, sir. Fare you well.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nGood night.\r\nThis deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant\r\nAnd dull to all proceedings. A deflowered maid;\r\nAnd by an eminent body that enforced\r\nThe law against it! But that her tender shame\r\nWill not proclaim against her maiden loss,\r\nHow might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no,\r\nFor my authority bears so credent bulk\r\nThat no particular scandal once can touch\r\nBut it confounds the breather. He should have lived,\r\nSave that his riotous youth, with dangerous sense,\r\nMight in the times to come have ta’en revenge\r\nBy so receiving a dishonoured life\r\nWith ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived.\r\nAlack, when once our grace we have forgot,\r\nNothing goes right; we would, and we would not.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE V. Fields without the town.\r\n\r\nEnter Duke, in his own habit, and Friar Peter.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThese letters at fit time deliver me.\r\nThe Provost knows our purpose and our plot.\r\nThe matter being afoot, keep your instruction\r\nAnd hold you ever to our special drift,\r\nThough sometimes you do blench from this to that\r\nAs cause doth minister. Go call at Flavius’ house,\r\nAnd tell him where I stay. Give the like notice\r\nTo Valencius, Rowland, and to Crassus,\r\nAnd bid them bring the trumpets to the gate.\r\nBut send me Flavius first.\r\n\r\nFRIAR PETER.\r\nIt shall be speeded well.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Friar Peter._]\r\n\r\nEnter Varrius.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nI thank thee, Varrius, thou hast made good haste.\r\nCome, we will walk. There’s other of our friends\r\nWill greet us here anon. My gentle Varrius.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE VI. Street near the city gate.\r\n\r\nEnter Isabella and Mariana.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nTo speak so indirectly I am loath;\r\nI would say the truth, but to accuse him so\r\nThat is your part; yet I am advised to do it,\r\nHe says, to veil full purpose.\r\n\r\nMARIANA.\r\nBe ruled by him.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nBesides, he tells me that, if peradventure\r\nHe speak against me on the adverse side,\r\nI should not think it strange, for ’tis a physic\r\nThat’s bitter to sweet end.\r\n\r\nMARIANA.\r\nI would Friar Peter—\r\n\r\nEnter Friar Peter.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nO, peace, the friar is come.\r\n\r\nFRIAR PETER.\r\nCome, I have found you out a stand most fit,\r\nWhere you may have such vantage on the Duke\r\nHe shall not pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded.\r\nThe generous and gravest citizens\r\nHave hent the gates, and very near upon\r\nThe Duke is entering. Therefore hence, away.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\nACT V\r\n\r\nSCENE I. A public place near the city gate.\r\n\nEnter at several doors Duke, Varrius, Lords; Angelo, Escalus, Lucio,\r\nProvost, Officers and Citizens.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nMy very worthy cousin, fairly met.\r\nOur old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.\r\n\r\nANGELO and ESCALUS.\r\nHappy return be to your royal grace!\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nMany and hearty thankings to you both.\r\nWe have made inquiry of you, and we hear\r\nSuch goodness of your justice that our soul\r\nCannot but yield you forth to public thanks,\r\nForerunning more requital.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nYou make my bonds still greater.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nO, your desert speaks loud, and I should wrong it\r\nTo lock it in the wards of covert bosom,\r\nWhen it deserves with characters of brass\r\nA forted residence ’gainst the tooth of time\r\nAnd rasure of oblivion. Give me your hand\r\nAnd let the subject see, to make them know\r\nThat outward courtesies would fain proclaim\r\nFavours that keep within.—Come, Escalus,\r\nYou must walk by us on our other hand.\r\nAnd good supporters are you.\r\n\r\nEnter Friar Peter and Isabella.\r\n\r\nFRIAR PETER.\r\nNow is your time. Speak loud, and kneel before him.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nJustice, O royal Duke! Vail your regard\r\nUpon a wronged—I would fain have said, a maid.\r\nO worthy prince, dishonour not your eye\r\nBy throwing it on any other object\r\nTill you have heard me in my true complaint,\r\nAnd given me justice, justice, justice, justice!\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nRelate your wrongs. In what? By whom? Be brief.\r\nHere is Lord Angelo shall give you justice.\r\nReveal yourself to him.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nO worthy Duke,\r\nYou bid me seek redemption of the devil.\r\nHear me yourself, for that which I must speak\r\nMust either punish me, not being believed,\r\nOr wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, here!\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nMy lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm.\r\nShe hath been a suitor to me for her brother,\r\nCut off by course of justice.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nBy course of justice!\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nAnd she will speak most bitterly and strange.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nMost strange, but yet most truly will I speak.\r\nThat Angelo’s forsworn, is it not strange?\r\nThat Angelo’s a murderer, is’t not strange?\r\nThat Angelo is an adulterous thief,\r\nAn hypocrite, a virgin-violator,\r\nIs it not strange and strange?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nNay, it is ten times strange.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nIt is not truer he is Angelo\r\nThan this is all as true as it is strange.\r\nNay, it is ten times true, for truth is truth\r\nTo th’ end of reckoning.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nAway with her. Poor soul,\r\nShe speaks this in th’ infirmity of sense.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nO Prince, I conjure thee, as thou believ’st\r\nThere is another comfort than this world,\r\nThat thou neglect me not with that opinion\r\nThat I am touched with madness. Make not impossible\r\nThat which but seems unlike. ’Tis not impossible\r\nBut one, the wicked’st caitiff on the ground,\r\nMay seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute,\r\nAs Angelo; even so may Angelo,\r\nIn all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,\r\nBe an arch-villain. Believe it, royal Prince,\r\nIf he be less, he’s nothing; but he’s more,\r\nHad I more name for badness.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nBy mine honesty,\r\nIf she be mad, as I believe no other,\r\nHer madness hath the oddest frame of sense,\r\nSuch a dependency of thing on thing,\r\nAs e’er I heard in madness.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nO gracious Duke,\r\nHarp not on that; nor do not banish reason\r\nFor inequality; but let your reason serve\r\nTo make the truth appear where it seems hid,\r\nAnd hide the false seems true.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nMany that are not mad\r\nHave, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nI am the sister of one Claudio,\r\nCondemned upon the act of fornication\r\nTo lose his head; condemned by Angelo.\r\nI, in probation of a sisterhood,\r\nWas sent to by my brother; one Lucio\r\nAs then the messenger.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nThat’s I, an’t like your Grace.\r\nI came to her from Claudio and desired her\r\nTo try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo\r\nFor her poor brother’s pardon.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nThat’s he, indeed.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nYou were not bid to speak.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nNo, my good lord,\r\nNor wished to hold my peace.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nI wish you now, then;\r\nPray you take note of it; and when you have\r\nA business for yourself, pray heaven you then\r\nBe perfect.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nI warrant your honour.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThe warrant’s for yourself. Take heed to it.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nThis gentleman told somewhat of my tale.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nRight.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nIt may be right, but you are i’ the wrong\r\nTo speak before your time.—Proceed.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nI went\r\nTo this pernicious caitiff deputy.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThat’s somewhat madly spoken.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nPardon it;\r\nThe phrase is to the matter.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nMended again. The matter; proceed.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nIn brief, to set the needless process by:\r\nHow I persuaded, how I prayed and kneeled,\r\nHow he refelled me, and how I replied—\r\nFor this was of much length—the vile conclusion\r\nI now begin with grief and shame to utter.\r\nHe would not, but by gift of my chaste body\r\nTo his concupiscible intemperate lust,\r\nRelease my brother; and after much debatement,\r\nMy sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,\r\nAnd I did yield to him. But the next morn betimes,\r\nHis purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant\r\nFor my poor brother’s head.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThis is most likely!\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nO, that it were as like as it is true!\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nBy heaven, fond wretch, thou know’st not what thou speak’st,\r\nOr else thou art suborned against his honour\r\nIn hateful practice. First, his integrity\r\nStands without blemish; next, it imports no reason\r\nThat with such vehemency he should pursue\r\nFaults proper to himself. If he had so offended,\r\nHe would have weighed thy brother by himself,\r\nAnd not have cut him off. Someone hath set you on.\r\nConfess the truth, and say by whose advice\r\nThou cam’st here to complain.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nAnd is this all?\r\nThen, O you blessed ministers above,\r\nKeep me in patience, and with ripened time\r\nUnfold the evil which is here wrapt up\r\nIn countenance! Heaven shield your Grace from woe,\r\nAs I, thus wronged, hence unbelieved go.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nI know you’d fain be gone. An officer!\r\nTo prison with her! Shall we thus permit\r\nA blasting and a scandalous breath to fall\r\nOn him so near us? This needs must be a practice.\r\nWho knew of your intent and coming hither?\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nOne that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Officer with Isabella._]\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nA ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nMy lord, I know him. ’Tis a meddling friar.\r\nI do not like the man. Had he been lay, my lord,\r\nFor certain words he spake against your Grace\r\nIn your retirement, I had swinged him soundly.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWords against me? This’s a good friar, belike.\r\nAnd to set on this wretched woman here\r\nAgainst our substitute! Let this friar be found.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nBut yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,\r\nI saw them at the prison. A saucy friar,\r\nA very scurvy fellow.\r\n\r\nFRIAR PETER.\r\nBlessed be your royal Grace!\r\nI have stood by, my lord, and I have heard\r\nYour royal ear abused. First hath this woman\r\nMost wrongfully accused your substitute,\r\nWho is as free from touch or soil with her\r\nAs she from one ungot.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWe did believe no less.\r\nKnow you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?\r\n\r\nFRIAR PETER.\r\nI know him for a man divine and holy,\r\nNot scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,\r\nAs he’s reported by this gentleman;\r\nAnd, on my trust, a man that never yet\r\nDid, as he vouches, misreport your Grace.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nMy lord, most villainously; believe it.\r\n\r\nFRIAR PETER.\r\nWell, he in time may come to clear himself;\r\nBut at this instant he is sick, my lord,\r\nOf a strange fever. Upon his mere request,\r\nBeing come to knowledge that there was complaint\r\nIntended ’gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither\r\nTo speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know\r\nIs true and false; and what he with his oath\r\nAnd all probation will make up full clear\r\nWhensoever he’s convented. First, for this woman,\r\nTo justify this worthy nobleman,\r\nSo vulgarly and personally accused,\r\nHer shall you hear disproved to her eyes,\r\nTill she herself confess it.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nGood friar, let’s hear it.\r\nDo you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?\r\nO heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!\r\nGive us some seats.—Come, cousin Angelo,\r\nIn this I’ll be impartial. Be you judge\r\nOf your own cause.\r\n\r\nEnter Mariana, veiled.\r\n\r\nIs this the witness, friar?\r\nFirst let her show her face, and after speak.\r\n\r\nMARIANA.\r\nPardon, my lord; I will not show my face\r\nUntil my husband bid me.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWhat, are you married?\r\n\r\nMARIANA.\r\nNo, my lord.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nAre you a maid?\r\n\r\nMARIANA.\r\nNo, my lord.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nA widow, then?\r\n\r\nMARIANA.\r\nNeither, my lord.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWhy, you are nothing then, neither maid, widow, nor wife?\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nMy lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are neither maid, widow,\r\nnor wife.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nSilence that fellow. I would he had some cause to prattle for himself.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nWell, my lord.\r\n\r\nMARIANA.\r\nMy lord, I do confess I ne’er was married,\r\nAnd I confess besides, I am no maid.\r\nI have known my husband; yet my husband\r\nKnows not that ever he knew me.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nHe was drunk, then, my lord; it can be no better.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nFor the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nWell, my lord.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThis is no witness for Lord Angelo.\r\n\r\nMARIANA.\r\nNow I come to’t, my lord.\r\nShe that accuses him of fornication\r\nIn self-same manner doth accuse my husband,\r\nAnd charges him, my lord, with such a time\r\nWhen I’ll depose I had him in mine arms\r\nWith all th’ effect of love.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nCharges she more than me?\r\n\r\nMARIANA.\r\nNot that I know.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nNo? You say your husband.\r\n\r\nMARIANA.\r\nWhy, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,\r\nWho thinks he knows that he ne’er knew my body,\r\nBut knows, he thinks, that he knows Isabel’s.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nThis is a strange abuse. Let’s see thy face.\r\n\r\nMARIANA.\r\nMy husband bids me; now I will unmask. [_Unveiling_.]\r\nThis is that face, thou cruel Angelo,\r\nWhich once thou swor’st was worth the looking on.\r\nThis is the hand which, with a vowed contract,\r\nWas fast belocked in thine. This is the body\r\nThat took away the match from Isabel\r\nAnd did supply thee at thy garden-house\r\nIn her imagined person.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nKnow you this woman?\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nCarnally, she says.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nSirrah, no more.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nEnough, my lord.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nMy lord, I must confess I know this woman;\r\nAnd five years since there was some speech of marriage\r\nBetwixt myself and her; which was broke off,\r\nPartly for that her promised proportions\r\nCame short of composition; but in chief\r\nFor that her reputation was disvalued\r\nIn levity. Since which time of five years\r\nI never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,\r\nUpon my faith and honour.\r\n\r\nMARIANA.\r\nNoble Prince,\r\nAs there comes light from heaven and words from breath,\r\nAs there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,\r\nI am affianced this man’s wife as strongly\r\nAs words could make up vows. And, my good lord,\r\nBut Tuesday night last gone, in’s garden-house,\r\nHe knew me as a wife. As this is true,\r\nLet me in safety raise me from my knees,\r\nOr else for ever be confixed here,\r\nA marble monument!\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nI did but smile till now.\r\nNow, good my lord, give me the scope of justice.\r\nMy patience here is touched. I do perceive\r\nThese poor informal women are no more\r\nBut instruments of some more mightier member\r\nThat sets them on. Let me have way, my lord,\r\nTo find this practice out.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nAy, with my heart;\r\nAnd punish them to your height of pleasure.\r\nThou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,\r\nCompact with her that’s gone, think’st thou thy oaths,\r\nThough they would swear down each particular saint,\r\nWere testimonies against his worth and credit,\r\nThat’s sealed in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,\r\nSit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains\r\nTo find out this abuse, whence ’tis derived.\r\nThere is another friar that set them on;\r\nLet him be sent for.\r\n\r\nFRIAR PETER.\r\nWould he were here, my lord; for he indeed\r\nHath set the women on to this complaint.\r\nYour Provost knows the place where he abides,\r\nAnd he may fetch him.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nGo, do it instantly.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Provost._]\r\n\r\nAnd you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,\r\nWhom it concerns to hear this matter forth,\r\nDo with your injuries as seems you best\r\nIn any chastisement. I for a while\r\nWill leave you; but stir not you till you have\r\nWell determined upon these slanderers.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nMy lord, we’ll do it throughly.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Duke._]\r\n\r\nSignior Lucio, did not you say you knew that Friar Lodowick to be a\r\ndishonest person?\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\n_Cucullus non facit monachum_, honest in nothing but in his clothes,\r\nand one that hath spoke most villainous speeches of the Duke.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nWe shall entreat you to abide here till he come, and enforce them\r\nagainst him. We shall find this friar a notable fellow.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nAs any in Vienna, on my word.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nCall that same Isabel here once again. I would speak with her.\r\n\r\n[_Exit an Attendant._]\r\n\r\nPray you, my lord, give me leave to question; you shall see how I’ll\r\nhandle her.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nNot better than he, by her own report.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nSay you?\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nMarry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately, she would sooner\r\nconfess; perchance, publicly, she’ll be ashamed.\r\n\r\nEnter at several doors Duke as a friar, Provost and Isabella with\r\nOfficers.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nI will go darkly to work with her.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nThat’s the way; for women are light at midnight.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\n[_To Isabella_.] Come on, mistress, here’s a gentlewoman denies all\r\nthat you have said.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nMy lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of, here with the Provost.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nIn very good time. Speak not you to him till we call upon you.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nMum.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nCome, sir, did you set these women on to slander Lord Angelo? They have\r\nconfessed you did.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\n’Tis false.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nHow! Know you where you are?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nRespect to your great place; and let the devil\r\nBe sometime honoured for his burning throne.\r\nWhere is the Duke? ’Tis he should hear me speak.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nThe Duke’s in us; and we will hear you speak.\r\nLook you speak justly.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nBoldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,\r\nCome you to seek the lamb here of the fox,\r\nGood night to your redress! Is the Duke gone?\r\nThen is your cause gone too. The Duke’s unjust\r\nThus to retort your manifest appeal,\r\nAnd put your trial in the villain’s mouth\r\nWhich here you come to accuse.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nThis is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nWhy, thou unreverend and unhallowed friar,\r\nIs’t not enough thou hast suborned these women\r\nTo accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth,\r\nAnd in the witness of his proper ear,\r\nTo call him villain? And then to glance from him\r\nTo th’ Duke himself, to tax him with injustice?\r\nTake him hence! To th’ rack with him! We’ll touse you\r\nJoint by joint, but we will know his purpose.\r\nWhat! Unjust?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nBe not so hot. The Duke\r\nDare no more stretch this finger of mine than he\r\nDare rack his own. His subject am I not,\r\nNor here provincial. My business in this state\r\nMade me a looker-on here in Vienna,\r\nWhere I have seen corruption boil and bubble\r\nTill it o’errun the stew. Laws for all faults,\r\nBut faults so countenanced that the strong statutes\r\nStand like the forfeits in a barber’s shop,\r\nAs much in mock as mark.\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nSlander to the state! Away with him to prison!\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nWhat can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?\r\nIs this the man that you did tell us of?\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\n’Tis he, my lord. Come hither, goodman Baldpate.\r\nDo you know me?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nI remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice. I met you at the\r\nprison, in the absence of the Duke.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nO did you so? And do you remember what you said of the Duke?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nMost notedly, sir.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nDo you so, sir? And was the Duke a fleshmonger, a fool, and a coward,\r\nas you then reported him to be?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nYou must, sir, change persons with me ere you make that my report. You\r\nindeed spoke so of him, and much more, much worse.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nO thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the nose for thy\r\nspeeches?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nI protest I love the Duke as I love myself.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nHark how the villain would close now, after his treasonable abuses!\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nSuch a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away with him to prison!\r\nWhere is the provost? Away with him to prison! Lay bolts enough upon\r\nhim. Let him speak no more. Away with those giglets too, and with the\r\nother confederate companion!\r\n\r\n[_The Provost lays hands on the Duke._]\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nStay, sir, stay a while.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nWhat, resists he? Help him, Lucio.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nCome, sir, come, sir, come, sir. Foh, sir! Why, you bald-pated lying\r\nrascal! You must be hooded, must you? Show your knave’s visage, with a\r\npox to you! Show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour! Will’t\r\nnot off?\r\n\r\n[_Pulls off the friar’s hood and discovers the Duke._]\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThou art the first knave that e’er mad’st a duke.\r\nFirst, Provost, let me bail these gentle three.\r\n[_To Lucio_.] Sneak not away, sir, for the friar and you\r\nMust have a word anon.—Lay hold on him.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nThis may prove worse than hanging.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\n[_To Escalus_.] What you have spoke I pardon. Sit you down.\r\nWe’ll borrow place of him. [_To Angelo_.] Sir, by your leave.\r\nHast thou or word, or wit, or impudence,\r\nThat yet can do thee office? If thou hast,\r\nRely upon it till my tale be heard,\r\nAnd hold no longer out.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nO my dread lord,\r\nI should be guiltier than my guiltiness\r\nTo think I can be undiscernible,\r\nWhen I perceive your Grace, like power divine,\r\nHath looked upon my passes. Then, good Prince,\r\nNo longer session hold upon my shame,\r\nBut let my trial be mine own confession.\r\nImmediate sentence then, and sequent death\r\nIs all the grace I beg.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nCome hither, Mariana.\r\nSay, wast thou e’er contracted to this woman?\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nI was, my lord.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nGo, take her hence and marry her instantly.\r\nDo you the office, friar; which consummate,\r\nReturn him here again.—Go with him, Provost.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Angelo, Mariana, Friar Peter and Provost._]\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nMy lord, I am more amazed at his dishonour\r\nThan at the strangeness of it.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nCome hither, Isabel.\r\nYour friar is now your prince. As I was then\r\nAdvertising and holy to your business,\r\nNot changing heart with habit, I am still\r\nAttorneyed at your service.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nO, give me pardon,\r\nThat I, your vassal, have employed and pained\r\nYour unknown sovereignty.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nYou are pardoned, Isabel.\r\nAnd now, dear maid, be you as free to us.\r\nYour brother’s death, I know, sits at your heart,\r\nAnd you may marvel why I obscured myself,\r\nLabouring to save his life, and would not rather\r\nMake rash remonstrance of my hidden power\r\nThan let him so be lost. O most kind maid,\r\nIt was the swift celerity of his death,\r\nWhich I did think with slower foot came on,\r\nThat brained my purpose. But peace be with him.\r\nThat life is better life, past fearing death,\r\nThan that which lives to fear. Make it your comfort,\r\nSo happy is your brother.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\nI do, my lord.\r\n\r\nEnter Angelo, Mariana, Friar Peter and Provost.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nFor this new-married man approaching here,\r\nWhose salt imagination yet hath wronged\r\nYour well-defended honour, you must pardon\r\nFor Mariana’s sake. But as he adjudged your brother,\r\nBeing criminal in double violation\r\nOf sacred chastity and of promise-breach\r\nThereon dependent, for your brother’s life,\r\nThe very mercy of the law cries out\r\nMost audible, even from his proper tongue,\r\n“An Angelo for Claudio, death for death.”\r\nHaste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;\r\nLike doth quit like, and measure still for measure.\r\nThen, Angelo, thy fault’s thus manifested,\r\nWhich, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.\r\nWe do condemn thee to the very block\r\nWhere Claudio stooped to death, and with like haste.\r\nAway with him.\r\n\r\nMARIANA.\r\nO my most gracious lord,\r\nI hope you will not mock me with a husband.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nIt is your husband mocked you with a husband.\r\nConsenting to the safeguard of your honour,\r\nI thought your marriage fit. Else imputation,\r\nFor that he knew you, might reproach your life,\r\nAnd choke your good to come. For his possessions,\r\nAlthough by confiscation they are ours,\r\nWe do instate and widow you with all\r\nTo buy you a better husband.\r\n\r\nMARIANA.\r\nO my dear lord,\r\nI crave no other, nor no better man.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nNever crave him; we are definitive.\r\n\r\nMARIANA.\r\n[_Kneeling_.] Gentle my liege—\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nYou do but lose your labour.\r\nAway with him to death. [_To Lucio_.] Now, sir, to you.\r\n\r\nMARIANA.\r\nO my good lord.—Sweet Isabel, take my part;\r\nLend me your knees, and all my life to come\r\nI’ll lend you all my life to do you service.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nAgainst all sense you do importune her.\r\nShould she kneel down in mercy of this fact,\r\nHer brother’s ghost his paved bed would break,\r\nAnd take her hence in horror.\r\n\r\nMARIANA.\r\nIsabel,\r\nSweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me;\r\nHold up your hands, say nothing. I’ll speak all.\r\nThey say best men are moulded out of faults,\r\nAnd, for the most, become much more the better\r\nFor being a little bad. So may my husband.\r\nO Isabel, will you not lend a knee?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nHe dies for Claudio’s death.\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\n[_Kneeling_.] Most bounteous sir,\r\nLook, if it please you, on this man condemned\r\nAs if my brother lived. I partly think\r\nA due sincerity governed his deeds\r\nTill he did look on me. Since it is so,\r\nLet him not die. My brother had but justice,\r\nIn that he did the thing for which he died.\r\nFor Angelo,\r\nHis act did not o’ertake his bad intent,\r\nAnd must be buried but as an intent\r\nThat perished by the way. Thoughts are no subjects;\r\nIntents but merely thoughts.\r\n\r\nMARIANA.\r\nMerely, my lord.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nYour suit’s unprofitable. Stand up, I say.\r\nI have bethought me of another fault.\r\nProvost, how came it Claudio was beheaded\r\nAt an unusual hour?\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nIt was commanded so.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nHad you a special warrant for the deed?\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nNo, my good lord, it was by private message.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nFor which I do discharge you of your office.\r\nGive up your keys.\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nPardon me, noble lord.\r\nI thought it was a fault, but knew it not;\r\nYet did repent me after more advice.\r\nFor testimony whereof, one in the prison\r\nThat should by private order else have died,\r\nI have reserved alive.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWhat’s he?\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nHis name is Barnardine.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nI would thou hadst done so by Claudio.\r\nGo fetch him hither, let me look upon him.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Provost._]\r\n\r\nESCALUS.\r\nI am sorry one so learned and so wise\r\nAs you, Lord Angelo, have still appeared,\r\nShould slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood\r\nAnd lack of tempered judgement afterward.\r\n\r\nANGELO.\r\nI am sorry that such sorrow I procure,\r\nAnd so deep sticks it in my penitent heart\r\nThat I crave death more willingly than mercy;\r\n’Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.\r\n\r\nEnter Provost with Barnardine, Claudio (muffled) and Juliet.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWhich is that Barnardine?\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nThis, my lord.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThere was a friar told me of this man.\r\nSirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul\r\nThat apprehends no further than this world,\r\nAnd squar’st thy life according. Thou’rt condemned;\r\nBut, for those earthly faults, I quit them all,\r\nAnd pray thee take this mercy to provide\r\nFor better times to come. Friar, advise him;\r\nI leave him to your hand.—What muffled fellow’s that?\r\n\r\nPROVOST.\r\nThis is another prisoner that I saved,\r\nWho should have died when Claudio lost his head;\r\nAs like almost to Claudio as himself.\r\n\r\n[_Unmuffles Claudio._]\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\n[_To Isabella_.] If he be like your brother, for his sake\r\nIs he pardoned; and for your lovely sake,\r\nGive me your hand and say you will be mine.\r\nHe is my brother too. But fitter time for that.\r\nBy this Lord Angelo perceives he’s safe;\r\nMethinks I see a quick’ning in his eye.\r\nWell, Angelo, your evil quits you well.\r\nLook that you love your wife, her worth worth yours.\r\nI find an apt remission in myself.\r\nAnd yet here’s one in place I cannot pardon.\r\n[_To Lucio_.] You, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a coward,\r\nOne all of luxury, an ass, a madman.\r\nWherein have I so deserved of you\r\nThat you extol me thus?\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nFaith, my lord, I spoke it but according to the trick. If you will hang\r\nme for it, you may, but I had rather it would please you I might be\r\nwhipped.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWhipped first, sir, and hanged after.\r\nProclaim it, Provost, round about the city,\r\nIf any woman wronged by this lewd fellow,\r\nAs I have heard him swear himself there’s one\r\nWhom he begot with child—let her appear,\r\nAnd he shall marry her. The nuptial finished,\r\nLet him be whipped and hanged.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nI beseech your Highness, do not marry me to a whore. Your highness said\r\neven now I made you a duke; good my lord, do not recompense me in\r\nmaking me a cuckold.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nUpon mine honour, thou shalt marry her.\r\nThy slanders I forgive, and therewithal\r\nRemit thy other forfeits.—Take him to prison,\r\nAnd see our pleasure herein executed.\r\n\r\nLUCIO.\r\nMarrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death, whipping, and hanging.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nSlandering a prince deserves it.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Officers with Lucio._]\r\n\r\nShe, Claudio, that you wronged, look you restore.\r\nJoy to you, Mariana! Love her, Angelo.\r\nI have confessed her, and I know her virtue.\r\nThanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness;\r\nThere’s more behind that is more gratulate.\r\nThanks, Provost, for thy care and secrecy;\r\nWe shall employ thee in a worthier place.\r\nForgive him, Angelo, that brought you home\r\nThe head of Ragozine for Claudio’s.\r\nTh’ offence pardons itself. Dear Isabel,\r\nI have a motion much imports your good;\r\nWhereto if you’ll a willing ear incline,\r\nWhat’s mine is yours, and what is yours is mine.\r\nSo, bring us to our palace, where we’ll show\r\nWhat’s yet behind that’s meet you all should know.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\nTHE MERCHANT OF VENICE\r\n\nContents\r\n\r\nACT I\r\nScene I.

Venice. A street.\r\n\r\n Enter Antonio, Salarino and Solanio.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nIn sooth I know not why I am so sad,\r\nIt wearies me, you say it wearies you;\r\nBut how I caught it, found it, or came by it,\r\nWhat stuff ’tis made of, whereof it is born,\r\nI am to learn.\r\nAnd such a want-wit sadness makes of me,\r\nThat I have much ado to know myself.\r\n\r\nSALARINO.\r\nYour mind is tossing on the ocean,\r\nThere where your argosies, with portly sail\r\nLike signiors and rich burghers on the flood,\r\nOr as it were the pageants of the sea,\r\nDo overpeer the petty traffickers\r\nThat curtsy to them, do them reverence,\r\nAs they fly by them with their woven wings.\r\n\r\nSOLANIO.\r\nBelieve me, sir, had I such venture forth,\r\nThe better part of my affections would\r\nBe with my hopes abroad. I should be still\r\nPlucking the grass to know where sits the wind,\r\nPeering in maps for ports, and piers and roads;\r\nAnd every object that might make me fear\r\nMisfortune to my ventures, out of doubt\r\nWould make me sad.\r\n\r\nSALARINO.\r\nMy wind cooling my broth\r\nWould blow me to an ague when I thought\r\nWhat harm a wind too great might do at sea.\r\nI should not see the sandy hour-glass run\r\nBut I should think of shallows and of flats,\r\nAnd see my wealthy Andrew dock’d in sand,\r\nVailing her high top lower than her ribs\r\nTo kiss her burial. Should I go to church\r\nAnd see the holy edifice of stone\r\nAnd not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,\r\nWhich, touching but my gentle vessel’s side,\r\nWould scatter all her spices on the stream,\r\nEnrobe the roaring waters with my silks,\r\nAnd, in a word, but even now worth this,\r\nAnd now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought\r\nTo think on this, and shall I lack the thought\r\nThat such a thing bechanc’d would make me sad?\r\nBut tell not me, I know Antonio\r\nIs sad to think upon his merchandise.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nBelieve me, no. I thank my fortune for it,\r\nMy ventures are not in one bottom trusted,\r\nNor to one place; nor is my whole estate\r\nUpon the fortune of this present year.\r\nTherefore my merchandise makes me not sad.\r\n\r\nSALARINO.\r\nWhy then you are in love.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nFie, fie!\r\n\r\nSALARINO.\r\nNot in love neither? Then let us say you are sad\r\nBecause you are not merry; and ’twere as easy\r\nFor you to laugh and leap and say you are merry\r\nBecause you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,\r\nNature hath fram’d strange fellows in her time:\r\nSome that will evermore peep through their eyes,\r\nAnd laugh like parrots at a bagpiper.\r\nAnd other of such vinegar aspect\r\nThat they’ll not show their teeth in way of smile\r\nThough Nestor swear the jest be laughable.\r\n\r\n Enter Bassanio, Lorenzo and Gratiano.\r\n\r\nSOLANIO.\r\nHere comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,\r\nGratiano, and Lorenzo. Fare ye well.\r\nWe leave you now with better company.\r\n\r\nSALARINO.\r\nI would have stay’d till I had made you merry,\r\nIf worthier friends had not prevented me.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nYour worth is very dear in my regard.\r\nI take it your own business calls on you,\r\nAnd you embrace th’ occasion to depart.\r\n\r\nSALARINO.\r\nGood morrow, my good lords.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nGood signiors both, when shall we laugh? Say, when?\r\nYou grow exceeding strange. Must it be so?\r\n\r\nSALARINO.\r\nWe’ll make our leisures to attend on yours.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Salarino and Solanio._]\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nMy Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,\r\nWe two will leave you, but at dinner-time\r\nI pray you have in mind where we must meet.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nI will not fail you.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nYou look not well, Signior Antonio,\r\nYou have too much respect upon the world.\r\nThey lose it that do buy it with much care.\r\nBelieve me, you are marvellously chang’d.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nI hold the world but as the world, Gratiano,\r\nA stage, where every man must play a part,\r\nAnd mine a sad one.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nLet me play the fool,\r\nWith mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,\r\nAnd let my liver rather heat with wine\r\nThan my heart cool with mortifying groans.\r\nWhy should a man whose blood is warm within\r\nSit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?\r\nSleep when he wakes? And creep into the jaundice\r\nBy being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio,\r\n(I love thee, and ’tis my love that speaks):\r\nThere are a sort of men whose visages\r\nDo cream and mantle like a standing pond,\r\nAnd do a wilful stillness entertain,\r\nWith purpose to be dress’d in an opinion\r\nOf wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,\r\nAs who should say, “I am Sir Oracle,\r\nAnd when I ope my lips, let no dog bark.”\r\nO my Antonio, I do know of these\r\nThat therefore only are reputed wise\r\nFor saying nothing; when, I am very sure,\r\nIf they should speak, would almost damn those ears\r\nWhich, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.\r\nI’ll tell thee more of this another time.\r\nBut fish not with this melancholy bait\r\nFor this fool gudgeon, this opinion.\r\nCome, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well a while.\r\nI’ll end my exhortation after dinner.\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nWell, we will leave you then till dinner-time.\r\nI must be one of these same dumb wise men,\r\nFor Gratiano never lets me speak.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nWell, keep me company but two years moe,\r\nThou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nFare you well. I’ll grow a talker for this gear.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nThanks, i’ faith, for silence is only commendable\r\nIn a neat’s tongue dried, and a maid not vendible.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Gratiano and Lorenzo._]\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nIs that anything now?\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nGratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than any man in all\r\nVenice. His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of\r\nchaff: you shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you have them\r\nthey are not worth the search.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nWell, tell me now what lady is the same\r\nTo whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,\r\nThat you today promis’d to tell me of?\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\n’Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,\r\nHow much I have disabled mine estate\r\nBy something showing a more swelling port\r\nThan my faint means would grant continuance.\r\nNor do I now make moan to be abridg’d\r\nFrom such a noble rate, but my chief care\r\nIs to come fairly off from the great debts\r\nWherein my time, something too prodigal,\r\nHath left me gag’d. To you, Antonio,\r\nI owe the most in money and in love,\r\nAnd from your love I have a warranty\r\nTo unburden all my plots and purposes\r\nHow to get clear of all the debts I owe.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nI pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;\r\nAnd if it stand, as you yourself still do,\r\nWithin the eye of honour, be assur’d\r\nMy purse, my person, my extremest means\r\nLie all unlock’d to your occasions.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nIn my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,\r\nI shot his fellow of the self-same flight\r\nThe self-same way, with more advised watch\r\nTo find the other forth; and by adventuring both\r\nI oft found both. I urge this childhood proof\r\nBecause what follows is pure innocence.\r\nI owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,\r\nThat which I owe is lost. But if you please\r\nTo shoot another arrow that self way\r\nWhich you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,\r\nAs I will watch the aim, or to find both,\r\nOr bring your latter hazard back again,\r\nAnd thankfully rest debtor for the first.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nYou know me well, and herein spend but time\r\nTo wind about my love with circumstance;\r\nAnd out of doubt you do me now more wrong\r\nIn making question of my uttermost\r\nThan if you had made waste of all I have.\r\nThen do but say to me what I should do\r\nThat in your knowledge may by me be done,\r\nAnd I am prest unto it. Therefore, speak.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nIn Belmont is a lady richly left,\r\nAnd she is fair, and, fairer than that word,\r\nOf wondrous virtues. Sometimes from her eyes\r\nI did receive fair speechless messages:\r\nHer name is Portia, nothing undervalu’d\r\nTo Cato’s daughter, Brutus’ Portia.\r\nNor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,\r\nFor the four winds blow in from every coast\r\nRenowned suitors, and her sunny locks\r\nHang on her temples like a golden fleece,\r\nWhich makes her seat of Belmont Colchos’ strond,\r\nAnd many Jasons come in quest of her.\r\nO my Antonio, had I but the means\r\nTo hold a rival place with one of them,\r\nI have a mind presages me such thrift\r\nThat I should questionless be fortunate.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nThou know’st that all my fortunes are at sea;\r\nNeither have I money nor commodity\r\nTo raise a present sum, therefore go forth\r\nTry what my credit can in Venice do;\r\nThat shall be rack’d even to the uttermost,\r\nTo furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia.\r\nGo presently inquire, and so will I,\r\nWhere money is, and I no question make\r\nTo have it of my trust or for my sake.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. Belmont. A room in Portia’s house.\r\n\r\n Enter Portia with her waiting-woman Nerissa.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nBy my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this great world.\r\n\r\nNERISSA.\r\nYou would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the same abundance\r\nas your good fortunes are. And yet, for aught I see, they are as sick\r\nthat surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing. It is no\r\nmean happiness, therefore, to be seated in the mean. Superfluity come\r\nsooner by white hairs, but competency lives longer.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nGood sentences, and well pronounc’d.\r\n\r\nNERISSA.\r\nThey would be better if well followed.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nIf to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been\r\nchurches, and poor men’s cottages princes’ palaces. It is a good divine\r\nthat follows his own instructions; I can easier teach twenty what were\r\ngood to be done than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own\r\nteaching. The brain may devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper\r\nleaps o’er a cold decree; such a hare is madness the youth, to skip\r\no’er the meshes of good counsel the cripple. But this reasoning is not\r\nin the fashion to choose me a husband. O me, the word “choose”! I may\r\nneither choose who I would nor refuse who I dislike, so is the will of\r\na living daughter curb’d by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,\r\nNerissa, that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none?\r\n\r\nNERISSA.\r\nYour father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death have good\r\ninspirations. Therefore the lott’ry that he hath devised in these three\r\nchests of gold, silver, and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning\r\nchooses you, will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who\r\nyou shall rightly love. But what warmth is there in your affection\r\ntowards any of these princely suitors that are already come?\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nI pray thee over-name them, and as thou namest them, I will describe\r\nthem, and according to my description level at my affection.\r\n\r\nNERISSA.\r\nFirst, there is the Neapolitan prince.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nAy, that’s a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of his horse,\r\nand he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can\r\nshoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his mother play’d false with\r\na smith.\r\n\r\nNERISSA.\r\nThen is there the County Palatine.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nHe doth nothing but frown, as who should say “And you will not have me,\r\nchoose.” He hears merry tales and smiles not. I fear he will prove the\r\nweeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of unmannerly\r\nsadness in his youth. I had rather be married to a death’s-head with a\r\nbone in his mouth than to either of these. God defend me from these\r\ntwo!\r\n\r\nNERISSA.\r\nHow say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nGod made him, and therefore let him pass for a man. In truth, I know it\r\nis a sin to be a mocker, but he! why, he hath a horse better than the\r\nNeapolitan’s, a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palatine.\r\nHe is every man in no man. If a throstle sing, he falls straight\r\na-cap’ring. He will fence with his own shadow. If I should marry him, I\r\nshould marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me, I would forgive\r\nhim, for if he love me to madness, I shall never requite him.\r\n\r\nNERISSA.\r\nWhat say you then to Falconbridge, the young baron of England?\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nYou know I say nothing to him, for he understands not me, nor I him: he\r\nhath neither Latin, French, nor Italian, and you will come into the\r\ncourt and swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English. He is a\r\nproper man’s picture; but alas, who can converse with a dumb-show? How\r\noddly he is suited! I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round\r\nhose in France, his bonnet in Germany, and his behaviour everywhere.\r\n\r\nNERISSA.\r\nWhat think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nThat he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he borrowed a box of the\r\near of the Englishman, and swore he would pay him again when he was\r\nable. I think the Frenchman became his surety, and seal’d under for\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nNERISSA.\r\nHow like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony’s nephew?\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nVery vilely in the morning when he is sober, and most vilely in the\r\nafternoon when he is drunk: when he is best, he is a little worse than\r\na man, and when he is worst, he is little better than a beast. And the\r\nworst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall make shift to go without him.\r\n\r\nNERISSA.\r\nIf he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket, you should\r\nrefuse to perform your father’s will, if you should refuse to accept\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nTherefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep glass of\r\nRhenish wine on the contrary casket, for if the devil be within and\r\nthat temptation without, I know he will choose it. I will do anything,\r\nNerissa, ere I will be married to a sponge.\r\n\r\nNERISSA.\r\nYou need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords. They have\r\nacquainted me with their determinations, which is indeed to return to\r\ntheir home, and to trouble you with no more suit, unless you may be won\r\nby some other sort than your father’s imposition, depending on the\r\ncaskets.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nIf I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as Diana,\r\nunless I be obtained by the manner of my father’s will. I am glad this\r\nparcel of wooers are so reasonable, for there is not one among them but\r\nI dote on his very absence. And I pray God grant them a fair departure.\r\n\r\nNERISSA.\r\nDo you not remember, lady, in your father’s time, a Venetian, a scholar\r\nand a soldier, that came hither in company of the Marquis of\r\nMontferrat?\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nYes, yes, it was Bassanio, as I think, so was he call’d.\r\n\r\nNERISSA.\r\nTrue, madam. He, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes look’d upon,\r\nwas the best deserving a fair lady.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nI remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy praise.\r\n\r\n Enter a Servingman.\r\n\r\nHow now! what news?\r\n\r\nSERVINGMAN.\r\nThe four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their leave. And there\r\nis a forerunner come from a fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings\r\nword the Prince his master will be here tonight.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nIf I could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as I can bid the\r\nother four farewell, I should be glad of his approach. If he have the\r\ncondition of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had rather he\r\nshould shrive me than wive me. Come, Nerissa. Sirrah, go before. Whiles\r\nwe shut the gate upon one wooer, another knocks at the door.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. Venice. A public place.\r\n\r\n Enter Bassanio with Shylock the Jew.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nThree thousand ducats, well.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nAy, sir, for three months.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nFor three months, well.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nFor the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nAntonio shall become bound, well.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nMay you stead me? Will you pleasure me? Shall I know your answer?\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nThree thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio bound.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nYour answer to that.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nAntonio is a good man.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nHave you heard any imputation to the contrary?\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nHo, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a good man is to have\r\nyou understand me that he is sufficient. Yet his means are in\r\nsupposition: he hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the\r\nIndies. I understand, moreover, upon the Rialto, he hath a third at\r\nMexico, a fourth for England, and other ventures he hath squandered\r\nabroad. But ships are but boards, sailors but men; there be land-rats\r\nand water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves—I mean pirates—and then\r\nthere is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks. The man is,\r\nnotwithstanding, sufficient. Three thousand ducats. I think I may take\r\nhis bond.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nBe assured you may.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nI will be assured I may. And that I may be assured, I will bethink me.\r\nMay I speak with Antonio?\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nIf it please you to dine with us.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nYes, to smell pork, to eat of the habitation which your prophet, the\r\nNazarite, conjured the devil into. I will buy with you, sell with you,\r\ntalk with you, walk with you, and so following; but I will not eat with\r\nyou, drink with you, nor pray with you. What news on the Rialto? Who is\r\nhe comes here?\r\n\r\n Enter Antonio.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nThis is Signior Antonio.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\n[_Aside._] How like a fawning publican he looks!\r\nI hate him for he is a Christian,\r\nBut more for that in low simplicity\r\nHe lends out money gratis, and brings down\r\nThe rate of usance here with us in Venice.\r\nIf I can catch him once upon the hip,\r\nI will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.\r\nHe hates our sacred nation, and he rails,\r\nEven there where merchants most do congregate,\r\nOn me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift,\r\nWhich he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe\r\nIf I forgive him!\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nShylock, do you hear?\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nI am debating of my present store,\r\nAnd by the near guess of my memory\r\nI cannot instantly raise up the gross\r\nOf full three thousand ducats. What of that?\r\nTubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,\r\nWill furnish me. But soft! how many months\r\nDo you desire? [_To Antonio._] Rest you fair, good signior,\r\nYour worship was the last man in our mouths.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nShylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow\r\nBy taking nor by giving of excess,\r\nYet to supply the ripe wants of my friend,\r\nI’ll break a custom. [_To Bassanio._] Is he yet possess’d\r\nHow much ye would?\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nAy, ay, three thousand ducats.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nAnd for three months.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nI had forgot, three months, you told me so.\r\nWell then, your bond. And let me see, but hear you,\r\nMethought you said you neither lend nor borrow\r\nUpon advantage.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nI do never use it.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nWhen Jacob graz’d his uncle Laban’s sheep,—\r\nThis Jacob from our holy Abram was\r\nAs his wise mother wrought in his behalf,\r\nThe third possessor; ay, he was the third.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nAnd what of him? Did he take interest?\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nNo, not take interest, not, as you would say,\r\nDirectly interest; mark what Jacob did.\r\nWhen Laban and himself were compromis’d\r\nThat all the eanlings which were streak’d and pied\r\nShould fall as Jacob’s hire, the ewes being rank\r\nIn end of autumn turned to the rams,\r\nAnd when the work of generation was\r\nBetween these woolly breeders in the act,\r\nThe skilful shepherd pill’d me certain wands,\r\nAnd in the doing of the deed of kind,\r\nHe stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,\r\nWho then conceiving did in eaning time\r\nFall parti-colour’d lambs, and those were Jacob’s.\r\nThis was a way to thrive, and he was blest;\r\nAnd thrift is blessing if men steal it not.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nThis was a venture, sir, that Jacob serv’d for,\r\nA thing not in his power to bring to pass,\r\nBut sway’d and fashion’d by the hand of heaven.\r\nWas this inserted to make interest good?\r\nOr is your gold and silver ewes and rams?\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nI cannot tell; I make it breed as fast.\r\nBut note me, signior.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nMark you this, Bassanio,\r\nThe devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.\r\nAn evil soul producing holy witness\r\nIs like a villain with a smiling cheek,\r\nA goodly apple rotten at the heart.\r\nO, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nThree thousand ducats, ’tis a good round sum.\r\nThree months from twelve, then let me see the rate.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nWell, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nSignior Antonio, many a time and oft\r\nIn the Rialto you have rated me\r\nAbout my moneys and my usances.\r\nStill have I borne it with a patient shrug,\r\n(For suff’rance is the badge of all our tribe.)\r\nYou call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,\r\nAnd spet upon my Jewish gaberdine,\r\nAnd all for use of that which is mine own.\r\nWell then, it now appears you need my help.\r\nGo to, then, you come to me, and you say\r\n“Shylock, we would have moneys.” You say so:\r\nYou that did void your rheum upon my beard,\r\nAnd foot me as you spurn a stranger cur\r\nOver your threshold, moneys is your suit.\r\nWhat should I say to you? Should I not say\r\n“Hath a dog money? Is it possible\r\nA cur can lend three thousand ducats?” Or\r\nShall I bend low and, in a bondman’s key,\r\nWith bated breath and whisp’ring humbleness,\r\nSay this:\r\n“Fair sir, you spet on me on Wednesday last;\r\nYou spurn’d me such a day; another time\r\nYou call’d me dog; and for these courtesies\r\nI’ll lend you thus much moneys”?\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nI am as like to call thee so again,\r\nTo spet on thee again, to spurn thee too.\r\nIf thou wilt lend this money, lend it not\r\nAs to thy friends, for when did friendship take\r\nA breed for barren metal of his friend?\r\nBut lend it rather to thine enemy,\r\nWho if he break, thou mayst with better face\r\nExact the penalty.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nWhy, look you how you storm!\r\nI would be friends with you, and have your love,\r\nForget the shames that you have stain’d me with,\r\nSupply your present wants, and take no doit\r\nOf usance for my moneys, and you’ll not hear me,\r\nThis is kind I offer.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nThis were kindness.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nThis kindness will I show.\r\nGo with me to a notary, seal me there\r\nYour single bond; and in a merry sport,\r\nIf you repay me not on such a day,\r\nIn such a place, such sum or sums as are\r\nExpress’d in the condition, let the forfeit\r\nBe nominated for an equal pound\r\nOf your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken\r\nIn what part of your body pleaseth me.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nContent, in faith, I’ll seal to such a bond,\r\nAnd say there is much kindness in the Jew.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nYou shall not seal to such a bond for me,\r\nI’ll rather dwell in my necessity.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nWhy, fear not, man, I will not forfeit it,\r\nWithin these two months, that’s a month before\r\nThis bond expires, I do expect return\r\nOf thrice three times the value of this bond.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nO father Abram, what these Christians are,\r\nWhose own hard dealings teaches them suspect\r\nThe thoughts of others. Pray you, tell me this,\r\nIf he should break his day, what should I gain\r\nBy the exaction of the forfeiture?\r\nA pound of man’s flesh, taken from a man,\r\nIs not so estimable, profitable neither,\r\nAs flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say,\r\nTo buy his favour, I extend this friendship.\r\nIf he will take it, so. If not, adieu,\r\nAnd for my love I pray you wrong me not.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nYes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nThen meet me forthwith at the notary’s,\r\nGive him direction for this merry bond,\r\nAnd I will go and purse the ducats straight,\r\nSee to my house left in the fearful guard\r\nOf an unthrifty knave, and presently\r\nI’ll be with you.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nHie thee, gentle Jew.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Shylock._]\r\n\r\nThis Hebrew will turn Christian; he grows kind.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nI like not fair terms and a villain’s mind.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nCome on; in this there can be no dismay;\r\nMy ships come home a month before the day.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\nACT II\r\n\r\nSCENE I. Belmont. A room in Portia’s house.\r\n\r\n Flourish of cornets. Enter the Prince of Morocco, a tawny Moor all in\r\n white, and three or four followers accordingly, with Portia, Nerissa\r\n and their train.\r\n\r\nPRINCE OF MOROCCO.\r\nMislike me not for my complexion,\r\nThe shadowed livery of the burnish’d sun,\r\nTo whom I am a neighbour, and near bred.\r\nBring me the fairest creature northward born,\r\nWhere Phœbus’ fire scarce thaws the icicles,\r\nAnd let us make incision for your love\r\nTo prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.\r\nI tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine\r\nHath fear’d the valiant; by my love I swear\r\nThe best-regarded virgins of our clime\r\nHave lov’d it too. I would not change this hue,\r\nExcept to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nIn terms of choice I am not solely led\r\nBy nice direction of a maiden’s eyes;\r\nBesides, the lott’ry of my destiny\r\nBars me the right of voluntary choosing.\r\nBut if my father had not scanted me\r\nAnd hedg’d me by his wit to yield myself\r\nHis wife who wins me by that means I told you,\r\nYourself, renowned Prince, then stood as fair\r\nAs any comer I have look’d on yet\r\nFor my affection.\r\n\r\nPRINCE OF MOROCCO.\r\nEven for that I thank you.\r\nTherefore I pray you lead me to the caskets\r\nTo try my fortune. By this scimitar\r\nThat slew the Sophy and a Persian prince,\r\nThat won three fields of Sultan Solyman,\r\nI would o’erstare the sternest eyes that look,\r\nOutbrave the heart most daring on the earth,\r\nPluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear,\r\nYea, mock the lion when he roars for prey,\r\nTo win thee, lady. But, alas the while!\r\nIf Hercules and Lichas play at dice\r\nWhich is the better man, the greater throw\r\nMay turn by fortune from the weaker hand:\r\nSo is Alcides beaten by his rage,\r\nAnd so may I, blind Fortune leading me,\r\nMiss that which one unworthier may attain,\r\nAnd die with grieving.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nYou must take your chance,\r\nAnd either not attempt to choose at all,\r\nOr swear before you choose, if you choose wrong\r\nNever to speak to lady afterward\r\nIn way of marriage. Therefore be advis’d.\r\n\r\nPRINCE OF MOROCCO.\r\nNor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nFirst, forward to the temple. After dinner\r\nYour hazard shall be made.\r\n\r\nPRINCE OF MOROCCO.\r\nGood fortune then,\r\nTo make me blest or cursed’st among men!\r\n\r\n [_Cornets. Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. Venice. A street.\r\n\r\n Enter Launcelet Gobbo, the clown, alone.\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nCertainly my conscience will serve me to run from this Jew my master.\r\nThe fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me, saying to me “Gobbo,\r\nLauncelet Gobbo, good Launcelet” or “good Gobbo,” or “good Launcelet\r\nGobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away.” My conscience says\r\n“No; take heed, honest Launcelet, take heed, honest Gobbo” or, as\r\naforesaid, “honest Launcelet Gobbo, do not run, scorn running with thy\r\nheels.” Well, the most courageous fiend bids me pack. “Fia!” says the\r\nfiend, “away!” says the fiend. “For the heavens, rouse up a brave\r\nmind,” says the fiend, “and run.” Well, my conscience, hanging about\r\nthe neck of my heart, says very wisely to me “My honest friend\r\nLauncelet, being an honest man’s son”—or rather an honest woman’s son,\r\nfor indeed my father did something smack, something grow to, he had a\r\nkind of taste;—well, my conscience says “Launcelet, budge not.”\r\n“Budge,” says the fiend. “Budge not,” says my conscience. “Conscience,”\r\nsay I, “you counsel well.” “Fiend,” say I, “you counsel well.” To be\r\nruled by my conscience, I should stay with the Jew my master, who, (God\r\nbless the mark) is a kind of devil; and, to run away from the Jew, I\r\nshould be ruled by the fiend, who (saving your reverence) is the devil\r\nhimself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil incarnation, and, in my\r\nconscience, my conscience is but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to\r\ncounsel me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more friendly\r\ncounsel. I will run, fiend, my heels are at your commandment, I will\r\nrun.\r\n\r\n Enter Old Gobbo with a basket.\r\n\r\nGOBBO.\r\nMaster young man, you, I pray you; which is the way to Master Jew’s?\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\n[_Aside._] O heavens, this is my true-begotten father, who being more\r\nthan sand-blind, high-gravel blind, knows me not. I will try confusions\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nGOBBO.\r\nMaster young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way to Master Jew’s?\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nTurn up on your right hand at the next turning, but at the next turning\r\nof all on your left; marry, at the very next turning, turn of no hand,\r\nbut turn down indirectly to the Jew’s house.\r\n\r\nGOBBO.\r\nBe God’s sonties, ’twill be a hard way to hit. Can you tell me whether\r\none Launcelet, that dwells with him, dwell with him or no?\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nTalk you of young Master Launcelet? [_Aside._] Mark me now, now will I\r\nraise the waters. Talk you of young Master Launcelet?\r\n\r\nGOBBO.\r\nNo master, sir, but a poor man’s son, his father, though I say’t, is an\r\nhonest exceeding poor man, and, God be thanked, well to live.\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nWell, let his father be what he will, we talk of young Master\r\nLauncelet.\r\n\r\nGOBBO.\r\nYour worship’s friend, and Launcelet, sir.\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nBut I pray you, _ergo_, old man, _ergo_, I beseech you, talk you of\r\nyoung Master Launcelet?\r\n\r\nGOBBO.\r\nOf Launcelet, an’t please your mastership.\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\n_Ergo_, Master Launcelet. Talk not of Master Launcelet, father, for the\r\nyoung gentleman, according to Fates and Destinies, and such odd\r\nsayings, the Sisters Three and such branches of learning, is indeed\r\ndeceased, or, as you would say in plain terms, gone to heaven.\r\n\r\nGOBBO.\r\nMarry, God forbid! The boy was the very staff of my age, my very prop.\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\n[_Aside._] Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or a prop?\r\nDo you know me, father?\r\n\r\nGOBBO.\r\nAlack the day! I know you not, young gentleman, but I pray you tell me,\r\nis my boy, God rest his soul, alive or dead?\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nDo you not know me, father?\r\n\r\nGOBBO.\r\nAlack, sir, I am sand-blind, I know you not.\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nNay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of the knowing me: it\r\nis a wise father that knows his own child. Well, old man, I will tell\r\nyou news of your son. Give me your blessing, truth will come to light,\r\nmurder cannot be hid long, a man’s son may, but in the end truth will\r\nout.\r\n\r\nGOBBO.\r\nPray you, sir, stand up, I am sure you are not Launcelet my boy.\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nPray you, let’s have no more fooling about it, but give me your\r\nblessing. I am Launcelet, your boy that was, your son that is, your\r\nchild that shall be.\r\n\r\nGOBBO.\r\nI cannot think you are my son.\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nI know not what I shall think of that; but I am Launcelet, the Jew’s\r\nman, and I am sure Margery your wife is my mother.\r\n\r\nGOBBO.\r\nHer name is Margery, indeed. I’ll be sworn if thou be Launcelet, thou\r\nart mine own flesh and blood. Lord worshipped might he be, what a beard\r\nhast thou got! Thou hast got more hair on thy chin than Dobbin my\r\nfill-horse has on his tail.\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nIt should seem, then, that Dobbin’s tail grows backward. I am sure he\r\nhad more hair on his tail than I have on my face when I last saw him.\r\n\r\nGOBBO.\r\nLord, how art thou changed! How dost thou and thy master agree? I have\r\nbrought him a present. How ’gree you now?\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nWell, well. But for mine own part, as I have set up my rest to run\r\naway, so I will not rest till I have run some ground. My master’s a\r\nvery Jew. Give him a present! Give him a halter. I am famished in his\r\nservice. You may tell every finger I have with my ribs. Father, I am\r\nglad you are come, give me your present to one Master Bassanio, who\r\nindeed gives rare new liveries. If I serve not him, I will run as far\r\nas God has any ground. O rare fortune, here comes the man! To him,\r\nfather; for I am a Jew, if I serve the Jew any longer.\r\n\r\n Enter Bassanio with Leonardo and a follower or two.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nYou may do so, but let it be so hasted that supper be ready at the\r\nfarthest by five of the clock. See these letters delivered, put the\r\nliveries to making, and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging.\r\n\r\n [_Exit a Servant._]\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nTo him, father.\r\n\r\nGOBBO.\r\nGod bless your worship!\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nGramercy, wouldst thou aught with me?\r\n\r\nGOBBO.\r\nHere’s my son, sir, a poor boy.\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nNot a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew’s man, that would, sir, as my\r\nfather shall specify.\r\n\r\nGOBBO.\r\nHe hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve.\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nIndeed the short and the long is, I serve the Jew, and have a desire,\r\nas my father shall specify.\r\n\r\nGOBBO.\r\nHis master and he (saving your worship’s reverence) are scarce\r\ncater-cousins.\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nTo be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having done me wrong, doth\r\ncause me, as my father, being I hope an old man, shall frutify unto\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nGOBBO.\r\nI have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon your worship, and\r\nmy suit is—\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nIn very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as your worship shall\r\nknow by this honest old man, and though I say it, though old man, yet\r\npoor man, my father.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nOne speak for both. What would you?\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nServe you, sir.\r\n\r\nGOBBO.\r\nThat is the very defect of the matter, sir.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nI know thee well; thou hast obtain’d thy suit.\r\nShylock thy master spoke with me this day,\r\nAnd hath preferr’d thee, if it be preferment\r\nTo leave a rich Jew’s service to become\r\nThe follower of so poor a gentleman.\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nThe old proverb is very well parted between my master Shylock and you,\r\nsir: you have “the grace of God”, sir, and he hath “enough”.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nThou speak’st it well. Go, father, with thy son.\r\nTake leave of thy old master, and inquire\r\nMy lodging out. [_To a Servant._] Give him a livery\r\nMore guarded than his fellows’; see it done.\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nFather, in. I cannot get a service, no! I have ne’er a tongue in my\r\nhead! [_Looking on his palm._] Well, if any man in Italy have a fairer\r\ntable which doth offer to swear upon a book, I shall have good fortune;\r\ngo to, here’s a simple line of life. Here’s a small trifle of wives,\r\nalas, fifteen wives is nothing; eleven widows and nine maids is a\r\nsimple coming-in for one man. And then to scape drowning thrice, and to\r\nbe in peril of my life with the edge of a feather-bed; here are simple\r\n’scapes. Well, if Fortune be a woman, she’s a good wench for this gear.\r\nFather, come; I’ll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Launcelet and Old Gobbo._]\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nI pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this.\r\nThese things being bought and orderly bestow’d,\r\nReturn in haste, for I do feast tonight\r\nMy best esteem’d acquaintance; hie thee, go.\r\n\r\nLEONARDO.\r\nMy best endeavours shall be done herein.\r\n\r\n Enter Gratiano.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nWhere’s your master?\r\n\r\nLEONARDO.\r\nYonder, sir, he walks.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nSignior Bassanio!\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nGratiano!\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nI have suit to you.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nYou have obtain’d it.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nYou must not deny me, I must go with you to Belmont.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nWhy, then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano,\r\nThou art too wild, too rude, and bold of voice,\r\nParts that become thee happily enough,\r\nAnd in such eyes as ours appear not faults;\r\nBut where thou art not known, why there they show\r\nSomething too liberal. Pray thee, take pain\r\nTo allay with some cold drops of modesty\r\nThy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behaviour\r\nI be misconst’red in the place I go to,\r\nAnd lose my hopes.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nSignior Bassanio, hear me.\r\nIf I do not put on a sober habit,\r\nTalk with respect, and swear but now and then,\r\nWear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely,\r\nNay more, while grace is saying, hood mine eyes\r\nThus with my hat, and sigh, and say “amen”;\r\nUse all the observance of civility\r\nLike one well studied in a sad ostent\r\nTo please his grandam, never trust me more.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nWell, we shall see your bearing.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nNay, but I bar tonight, you shall not gauge me\r\nBy what we do tonight.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nNo, that were pity.\r\nI would entreat you rather to put on\r\nYour boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends\r\nThat purpose merriment. But fare you well,\r\nI have some business.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nAnd I must to Lorenzo and the rest,\r\nBut we will visit you at supper-time.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. The same. A room in Shylock’s house.\r\n\r\n Enter Jessica and Launcelet.\r\n\r\nJESSICA.\r\nI am sorry thou wilt leave my father so.\r\nOur house is hell, and thou, a merry devil,\r\nDidst rob it of some taste of tediousness.\r\nBut fare thee well, there is a ducat for thee,\r\nAnd, Launcelet, soon at supper shalt thou see\r\nLorenzo, who is thy new master’s guest.\r\nGive him this letter, do it secretly.\r\nAnd so farewell. I would not have my father\r\nSee me in talk with thee.\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nAdieu! tears exhibit my tongue, most beautiful pagan, most sweet Jew!\r\nIf a Christian do not play the knave and get thee, I am much deceived.\r\nBut, adieu! These foolish drops do something drown my manly spirit.\r\nAdieu!\r\n\r\nJESSICA.\r\nFarewell, good Launcelet.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Launcelet._]\r\n\r\nAlack, what heinous sin is it in me\r\nTo be ashamed to be my father’s child!\r\nBut though I am a daughter to his blood,\r\nI am not to his manners.

She hath directed\r\nHow I shall take her from her father’s house,\r\nWhat gold and jewels she is furnish’d with,\r\nWhat page’s suit she hath in readiness.\r\nIf e’er the Jew her father come to heaven,\r\nIt will be for his gentle daughter’s sake;\r\nAnd never dare misfortune cross her foot,\r\nUnless she do it under this excuse,\r\nThat she is issue to a faithless Jew.\r\nCome, go with me, peruse this as thou goest;\r\nFair Jessica shall be my torch-bearer.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE V. The same. Before Shylock’s house.\r\n\r\n Enter Shylock the Jew and Launcelet his man that was the clown.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nWell, thou shalt see, thy eyes shall be thy judge,\r\nThe difference of old Shylock and Bassanio.—\r\nWhat, Jessica!—Thou shalt not gormandize\r\nAs thou hast done with me;—What, Jessica!—\r\nAnd sleep, and snore, and rend apparel out.\r\nWhy, Jessica, I say!\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nWhy, Jessica!\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nWho bids thee call? I do not bid thee call.\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nYour worship was wont to tell me I could do nothing without bidding.\r\n\r\n Enter Jessica.\r\n\r\nJESSICA.\r\nCall you? What is your will?\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nI am bid forth to supper, Jessica.\r\nThere are my keys. But wherefore should I go?\r\nI am not bid for love, they flatter me.\r\nBut yet I’ll go in hate, to feed upon\r\nThe prodigal Christian. Jessica, my girl,\r\nLook to my house. I am right loath to go;\r\nThere is some ill a-brewing towards my rest,\r\nFor I did dream of money-bags tonight.\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nI beseech you, sir, go. My young master doth expect your reproach.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nSo do I his.\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nAnd they have conspired together. I will not say you shall see a\r\nmasque, but if you do, then it was not for nothing that my nose fell\r\na-bleeding on Black Monday last at six o’clock i’ th’ morning, falling\r\nout that year on Ash-Wednesday was four year in th’ afternoon.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nWhat, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica,\r\nLock up my doors, and when you hear the drum\r\nAnd the vile squealing of the wry-neck’d fife,\r\nClamber not you up to the casements then,\r\nNor thrust your head into the public street\r\nTo gaze on Christian fools with varnish’d faces,\r\nBut stop my house’s ears, I mean my casements.\r\nLet not the sound of shallow fopp’ry enter\r\nMy sober house. By Jacob’s staff I swear\r\nI have no mind of feasting forth tonight.\r\nBut I will go. Go you before me, sirrah.\r\nSay I will come.\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nI will go before, sir.\r\nMistress, look out at window for all this.\r\n There will come a Christian by\r\n Will be worth a Jewess’ eye.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Launcelet._]\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nWhat says that fool of Hagar’s offspring, ha?\r\n\r\nJESSICA.\r\nHis words were “Farewell, mistress,” nothing else.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nThe patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder,\r\nSnail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day\r\nMore than the wild-cat. Drones hive not with me,\r\nTherefore I part with him, and part with him\r\nTo one that I would have him help to waste\r\nHis borrowed purse. Well, Jessica, go in.\r\nPerhaps I will return immediately:\r\nDo as I bid you, shut doors after you,\r\n“Fast bind, fast find.”\r\nA proverb never stale in thrifty mind.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nJESSICA.\r\nFarewell, and if my fortune be not crost,\r\nI have a father, you a daughter, lost.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE VI. The same.\r\n\r\n Enter the masquers, Gratiano and Salarino.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nThis is the penthouse under which Lorenzo\r\nDesired us to make stand.\r\n\r\nSALARINO.\r\nHis hour is almost past.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nAnd it is marvel he out-dwells his hour,\r\nFor lovers ever run before the clock.\r\n\r\nSALARINO.\r\nO ten times faster Venus’ pigeons fly\r\nTo seal love’s bonds new-made than they are wont\r\nTo keep obliged faith unforfeited!\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nThat ever holds: who riseth from a feast\r\nWith that keen appetite that he sits down?\r\nWhere is the horse that doth untread again\r\nHis tedious measures with the unbated fire\r\nThat he did pace them first? All things that are,\r\nAre with more spirit chased than enjoy’d.\r\nHow like a younger or a prodigal\r\nThe scarfed bark puts from her native bay,\r\nHugg’d and embraced by the strumpet wind!\r\nHow like the prodigal doth she return\r\nWith over-weather’d ribs and ragged sails,\r\nLean, rent, and beggar’d by the strumpet wind!\r\n\r\n Enter Lorenzo.\r\n\r\nSALARINO.\r\nHere comes Lorenzo, more of this hereafter.\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nSweet friends, your patience for my long abode.\r\nNot I but my affairs have made you wait.\r\nWhen you shall please to play the thieves for wives,\r\nI’ll watch as long for you then. Approach.\r\nHere dwells my father Jew. Ho! who’s within?\r\n\r\n Enter Jessica above, in boy’s clothes.\r\n\r\nJESSICA.\r\nWho are you? Tell me, for more certainty,\r\nAlbeit I’ll swear that I do know your tongue.\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nLorenzo, and thy love.\r\n\r\nJESSICA.\r\nLorenzo certain, and my love indeed,\r\nFor who love I so much? And now who knows\r\nBut you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nHeaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.\r\n\r\nJESSICA.\r\nHere, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.\r\nI am glad ’tis night, you do not look on me,\r\nFor I am much asham’d of my exchange.\r\nBut love is blind, and lovers cannot see\r\nThe pretty follies that themselves commit,\r\nFor if they could, Cupid himself would blush\r\nTo see me thus transformed to a boy.\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nDescend, for you must be my torch-bearer.\r\n\r\nJESSICA.\r\nWhat! must I hold a candle to my shames?\r\nThey in themselves, good sooth, are too too light.\r\nWhy, ’tis an office of discovery, love,\r\nAnd I should be obscur’d.\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nSo are you, sweet,\r\nEven in the lovely garnish of a boy.\r\nBut come at once,\r\nFor the close night doth play the runaway,\r\nAnd we are stay’d for at Bassanio’s feast.\r\n\r\nJESSICA.\r\nI will make fast the doors, and gild myself\r\nWith some moe ducats, and be with you straight.\r\n\r\n [_Exit above._]\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nNow, by my hood, a gentle, and no Jew.\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nBeshrew me but I love her heartily,\r\nFor she is wise, if I can judge of her,\r\nAnd fair she is, if that mine eyes be true,\r\nAnd true she is, as she hath prov’d herself.\r\nAnd therefore, like herself, wise, fair, and true,\r\nShall she be placed in my constant soul.\r\n\r\n Enter Jessica.\r\n\r\nWhat, art thou come? On, gentlemen, away!\r\nOur masquing mates by this time for us stay.\r\n\r\n [_Exit with Jessica and Salarino._]\r\n\r\n Enter Antonio.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nWho’s there?\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nSignior Antonio!\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nFie, fie, Gratiano! where are all the rest?\r\n’Tis nine o’clock, our friends all stay for you.\r\nNo masque tonight, the wind is come about;\r\nBassanio presently will go aboard.\r\nI have sent twenty out to seek for you.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nI am glad on’t. I desire no more delight\r\nThan to be under sail and gone tonight.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE VII. Belmont. A room in Portia’s house.\r\n\r\n Flourish of cornets. Enter Portia with the Prince of Morocco and both\r\n their trains.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nGo, draw aside the curtains and discover\r\nThe several caskets to this noble prince.\r\nNow make your choice.\r\n\r\nPRINCE OF MOROCCO.\r\nThe first, of gold, who this inscription bears,\r\n“Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.”\r\nThe second, silver, which this promise carries,\r\n“Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.”\r\nThis third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt,\r\n“Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.”\r\nHow shall I know if I do choose the right?\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nThe one of them contains my picture, prince.\r\nIf you choose that, then I am yours withal.\r\n\r\nPRINCE OF MOROCCO.\r\nSome god direct my judgment! Let me see.\r\nI will survey the inscriptions back again.\r\nWhat says this leaden casket?\r\n“Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.”\r\nMust give, for what? For lead? Hazard for lead!\r\nThis casket threatens; men that hazard all\r\nDo it in hope of fair advantages:\r\nA golden mind stoops not to shows of dross,\r\nI’ll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.\r\nWhat says the silver with her virgin hue?\r\n“Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.”\r\nAs much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco,\r\nAnd weigh thy value with an even hand.\r\nIf thou be’st rated by thy estimation\r\nThou dost deserve enough, and yet enough\r\nMay not extend so far as to the lady.\r\nAnd yet to be afeard of my deserving\r\nWere but a weak disabling of myself.\r\nAs much as I deserve! Why, that’s the lady:\r\nI do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,\r\nIn graces, and in qualities of breeding;\r\nBut more than these, in love I do deserve.\r\nWhat if I stray’d no farther, but chose here?\r\nLet’s see once more this saying grav’d in gold:\r\n“Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.”\r\nWhy, that’s the lady, all the world desires her.\r\nFrom the four corners of the earth they come\r\nTo kiss this shrine, this mortal breathing saint.\r\nThe Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds\r\nOf wide Arabia are as throughfares now\r\nFor princes to come view fair Portia.\r\nThe watery kingdom, whose ambitious head\r\nSpets in the face of heaven, is no bar\r\nTo stop the foreign spirits, but they come\r\nAs o’er a brook to see fair Portia.\r\nOne of these three contains her heavenly picture.\r\nIs’t like that lead contains her? ’Twere damnation\r\nTo think so base a thought. It were too gross\r\nTo rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.\r\nOr shall I think in silver she’s immur’d\r\nBeing ten times undervalued to tried gold?\r\nO sinful thought! Never so rich a gem\r\nWas set in worse than gold. They have in England\r\nA coin that bears the figure of an angel\r\nStamped in gold; but that’s insculp’d upon;\r\nBut here an angel in a golden bed\r\nLies all within. Deliver me the key.\r\nHere do I choose, and thrive I as I may.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nThere, take it, prince, and if my form lie there,\r\nThen I am yours.\r\n\r\n [_He unlocks the golden casket._]\r\n\r\nPRINCE OF MOROCCO.\r\nO hell! what have we here?\r\nA carrion Death, within whose empty eye\r\nThere is a written scroll. I’ll read the writing.\r\n\r\n _All that glisters is not gold,\r\n Often have you heard that told.\r\n Many a man his life hath sold\r\n But my outside to behold.\r\n Gilded tombs do worms infold.\r\n Had you been as wise as bold,\r\n Young in limbs, in judgment old,\r\n Your answer had not been inscroll’d,\r\n Fare you well, your suit is cold._\r\n\r\n Cold indeed and labour lost,\r\n Then farewell heat, and welcome frost.\r\nPortia, adieu! I have too griev’d a heart\r\nTo take a tedious leave. Thus losers part.\r\n\r\n [_Exit with his train. Flourish of cornets._]\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nA gentle riddance.

A street.\r\n\r\n Enter Salarino and Solanio.\r\n\r\nSALARINO.\r\nWhy, man, I saw Bassanio under sail;\r\nWith him is Gratiano gone along;\r\nAnd in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.\r\n\r\nSOLANIO.\r\nThe villain Jew with outcries rais’d the Duke,\r\nWho went with him to search Bassanio’s ship.\r\n\r\nSALARINO.\r\nHe came too late, the ship was under sail;\r\nBut there the Duke was given to understand\r\nThat in a gondola were seen together\r\nLorenzo and his amorous Jessica.\r\nBesides, Antonio certified the Duke\r\nThey were not with Bassanio in his ship.\r\n\r\nSOLANIO.\r\nI never heard a passion so confus’d,\r\nSo strange, outrageous, and so variable\r\nAs the dog Jew did utter in the streets.\r\n“My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter!\r\nFled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats!\r\nJustice! the law! my ducats and my daughter!\r\nA sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,\r\nOf double ducats, stol’n from me by my daughter!\r\nAnd jewels, two stones, two rich and precious stones,\r\nStol’n by my daughter! Justice! find the girl,\r\nShe hath the stones upon her and the ducats.”\r\n\r\nSALARINO.\r\nWhy, all the boys in Venice follow him,\r\nCrying, his stones, his daughter, and his ducats.\r\n\r\nSOLANIO.\r\nLet good Antonio look he keep his day\r\nOr he shall pay for this.\r\n\r\nSALARINO.\r\nMarry, well rememb’red.\r\nI reason’d with a Frenchman yesterday,\r\nWho told me, in the narrow seas that part\r\nThe French and English, there miscarried\r\nA vessel of our country richly fraught.\r\nI thought upon Antonio when he told me,\r\nAnd wish’d in silence that it were not his.\r\n\r\nSOLANIO.\r\nYou were best to tell Antonio what you hear,\r\nYet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.\r\n\r\nSALARINO.\r\nA kinder gentleman treads not the earth.\r\nI saw Bassanio and Antonio part,\r\nBassanio told him he would make some speed\r\nOf his return. He answered “Do not so,\r\nSlubber not business for my sake, Bassanio,\r\nBut stay the very riping of the time,\r\nAnd for the Jew’s bond which he hath of me,\r\nLet it not enter in your mind of love:\r\nBe merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts\r\nTo courtship, and such fair ostents of love\r\nAs shall conveniently become you there.”\r\nAnd even there, his eye being big with tears,\r\nTurning his face, he put his hand behind him,\r\nAnd with affection wondrous sensible\r\nHe wrung Bassanio’s hand, and so they parted.\r\n\r\nSOLANIO.\r\nI think he only loves the world for him.\r\nI pray thee, let us go and find him out\r\nAnd quicken his embraced heaviness\r\nWith some delight or other.\r\n\r\nSALARINO.\r\nDo we so.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IX. Belmont. A room in Portia’s house.\r\n\r\n Enter Nerissa and a Servitor.\r\n\r\nNERISSA.\r\nQuick, quick, I pray thee, draw the curtain straight.\r\nThe Prince of Arragon hath ta’en his oath,\r\nAnd comes to his election presently.\r\n\r\n Flourish of cornets. Enter the Prince of Arragon, his train, and\r\n Portia.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nBehold, there stand the caskets, noble Prince,\r\nIf you choose that wherein I am contain’d,\r\nStraight shall our nuptial rites be solemniz’d.\r\nBut if you fail, without more speech, my lord,\r\nYou must be gone from hence immediately.\r\n\r\nARRAGON.\r\nI am enjoin’d by oath to observe three things:\r\nFirst, never to unfold to anyone\r\nWhich casket ’twas I chose; next, if I fail\r\nOf the right casket, never in my life\r\nTo woo a maid in way of marriage;\r\nLastly,\r\nIf I do fail in fortune of my choice,\r\nImmediately to leave you and be gone.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nTo these injunctions everyone doth swear\r\nThat comes to hazard for my worthless self.\r\n\r\nARRAGON.\r\nAnd so have I address’d me. Fortune now\r\nTo my heart’s hope! Gold, silver, and base lead.\r\n“Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.”\r\nYou shall look fairer ere I give or hazard.\r\nWhat says the golden chest? Ha! let me see:\r\n“Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.”\r\nWhat many men desire! that “many” may be meant\r\nBy the fool multitude, that choose by show,\r\nNot learning more than the fond eye doth teach,\r\nWhich pries not to th’ interior, but like the martlet\r\nBuilds in the weather on the outward wall,\r\nEven in the force and road of casualty.\r\nI will not choose what many men desire,\r\nBecause I will not jump with common spirits\r\nAnd rank me with the barbarous multitudes.\r\nWhy, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house,\r\nTell me once more what title thou dost bear.\r\n“Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.”\r\nAnd well said too; for who shall go about\r\nTo cozen fortune, and be honourable\r\nWithout the stamp of merit? Let none presume\r\nTo wear an undeserved dignity.\r\nO that estates, degrees, and offices\r\nWere not deriv’d corruptly, and that clear honour\r\nWere purchas’d by the merit of the wearer!\r\nHow many then should cover that stand bare?\r\nHow many be commanded that command?\r\nHow much low peasantry would then be gleaned\r\nFrom the true seed of honour? And how much honour\r\nPick’d from the chaff and ruin of the times,\r\nTo be new varnish’d? Well, but to my choice.\r\n“Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.”\r\nI will assume desert. Give me a key for this,\r\nAnd instantly unlock my fortunes here.\r\n\r\n [_He opens the silver casket._]\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nToo long a pause for that which you find there.\r\n\r\nARRAGON.\r\nWhat’s here? The portrait of a blinking idiot\r\nPresenting me a schedule! I will read it.\r\nHow much unlike art thou to Portia!\r\nHow much unlike my hopes and my deservings!\r\n“Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.”\r\nDid I deserve no more than a fool’s head?\r\nIs that my prize? Are my deserts no better?\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nTo offend and judge are distinct offices,\r\nAnd of opposed natures.\r\n\r\nARRAGON.\r\nWhat is here?\r\n\r\n _The fire seven times tried this;\r\n Seven times tried that judgment is\r\n That did never choose amiss.\r\n Some there be that shadows kiss;\r\n Such have but a shadow’s bliss.\r\n There be fools alive, I wis,\r\n Silver’d o’er, and so was this.\r\n Take what wife you will to bed,\r\n I will ever be your head:\r\n So be gone; you are sped._\r\n\r\nStill more fool I shall appear\r\nBy the time I linger here.\r\nWith one fool’s head I came to woo,\r\nBut I go away with two.\r\nSweet, adieu!

What would my lord?\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nMadam, there is alighted at your gate\r\nA young Venetian, one that comes before\r\nTo signify th’ approaching of his lord,\r\nFrom whom he bringeth sensible regreets;\r\nTo wit (besides commends and courteous breath)\r\nGifts of rich value; yet I have not seen\r\nSo likely an ambassador of love.\r\nA day in April never came so sweet,\r\nTo show how costly summer was at hand,\r\nAs this fore-spurrer comes before his lord.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nNo more, I pray thee. I am half afeard\r\nThou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee,\r\nThou spend’st such high-day wit in praising him.\r\nCome, come, Nerissa, for I long to see\r\nQuick Cupid’s post that comes so mannerly.\r\n\r\nNERISSA.\r\nBassanio, Lord Love, if thy will it be!\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\nACT III\r\n\r\nSCENE I. Venice. A street.\r\n\r\n Enter Solanio and Salarino.\r\n\r\nSOLANIO.\r\nNow, what news on the Rialto?\r\n\r\nSALARINO.\r\nWhy, yet it lives there unchecked that Antonio hath a ship of rich\r\nlading wrack’d on the narrow seas; the Goodwins, I think they call the\r\nplace, a very dangerous flat and fatal, where the carcasses of many a\r\ntall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip Report be an honest\r\nwoman of her word.\r\n\r\nSOLANIO.\r\nI would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapped ginger or\r\nmade her neighbours believe she wept for the death of a third husband.\r\nBut it is true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain\r\nhighway of talk, that the good Antonio, the honest Antonio,—O that I\r\nhad a title good enough to keep his name company!—\r\n\r\nSALARINO.\r\nCome, the full stop.\r\n\r\nSOLANIO.\r\nHa, what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath lost a ship.\r\n\r\nSALARINO.\r\nI would it might prove the end of his losses.\r\n\r\nSOLANIO.\r\nLet me say “amen” betimes, lest the devil cross my prayer, for here he\r\ncomes in the likeness of a Jew.\r\n\r\n Enter Shylock.\r\n\r\nHow now, Shylock, what news among the merchants?\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nYou knew, none so well, none so well as you, of my daughter’s flight.\r\n\r\nSALARINO.\r\nThat’s certain, I, for my part, knew the tailor that made the wings she\r\nflew withal.\r\n\r\nSOLANIO.\r\nAnd Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was fledged; and then it\r\nis the complexion of them all to leave the dam.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nShe is damn’d for it.\r\n\r\nSALARINO.\r\nThat’s certain, if the devil may be her judge.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nMy own flesh and blood to rebel!\r\n\r\nSOLANIO.\r\nOut upon it, old carrion! Rebels it at these years?\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nI say my daughter is my flesh and my blood.\r\n\r\nSALARINO.\r\nThere is more difference between thy flesh and hers than between jet\r\nand ivory, more between your bloods than there is between red wine and\r\nRhenish. But tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any loss at\r\nsea or no?\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nThere I have another bad match, a bankrupt, a prodigal, who dare scarce\r\nshow his head on the Rialto, a beggar that used to come so smug upon\r\nthe mart; let him look to his bond. He was wont to call me usurer; let\r\nhim look to his bond: he was wont to lend money for a Christian cur’sy;\r\nlet him look to his bond.\r\n\r\nSALARINO.\r\nWhy, I am sure if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his flesh! What’s that\r\ngood for?\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nTo bait fish withal; if it will feed nothing else, it will feed my\r\nrevenge. He hath disgrac’d me and hind’red me half a million, laugh’d\r\nat my losses, mock’d at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my\r\nbargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies. And what’s his\r\nreason? I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs,\r\ndimensions, senses, affections, passions? Fed with the same food, hurt\r\nwith the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same\r\nmeans, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian\r\nis? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not\r\nlaugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we\r\nnot revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in\r\nthat. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility? Revenge. If a\r\nChristian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian\r\nexample? Why, revenge! The villainy you teach me I will execute, and it\r\nshall go hard but I will better the instruction.\r\n\r\n Enter a man from Antonio.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nGentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house, and desires to speak with\r\nyou both.\r\n\r\nSALARINO.\r\nWe have been up and down to seek him.\r\n\r\n Enter Tubal.\r\n\r\nSOLANIO.\r\nHere comes another of the tribe; a third cannot be match’d, unless the\r\ndevil himself turn Jew.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Solanio, Salarino and the Servant._]\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nHow now, Tubal, what news from Genoa? Hast thou found my daughter?\r\n\r\nTUBAL.\r\nI often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nWhy there, there, there, there! A diamond gone cost me two thousand\r\nducats in Frankfort! The curse never fell upon our nation till now, I\r\nnever felt it till now. Two thousand ducats in that, and other\r\nprecious, precious jewels. I would my daughter were dead at my foot,\r\nand the jewels in her ear; would she were hearsed at my foot, and the\r\nducats in her coffin. No news of them? Why so? And I know not what’s\r\nspent in the search. Why, thou—loss upon loss! The thief gone with so\r\nmuch, and so much to find the thief, and no satisfaction, no revenge,\r\nnor no ill luck stirring but what lights o’ my shoulders, no sighs but\r\no’ my breathing, no tears but o’ my shedding.\r\n\r\nTUBAL.\r\nYes, other men have ill luck too. Antonio, as I heard in Genoa—\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nWhat, what, what? Ill luck, ill luck?\r\n\r\nTUBAL.\r\n—hath an argosy cast away coming from Tripolis.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nI thank God! I thank God! Is it true, is it true?\r\n\r\nTUBAL.\r\nI spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wrack.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nI thank thee, good Tubal. Good news, good news! Ha, ha, heard in Genoa?\r\n\r\nTUBAL.\r\nYour daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, one night, fourscore ducats.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nThou stick’st a dagger in me. I shall never see my gold again.\r\nFourscore ducats at a sitting! Fourscore ducats!\r\n\r\nTUBAL.\r\nThere came divers of Antonio’s creditors in my company to Venice that\r\nswear he cannot choose but break.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nI am very glad of it. I’ll plague him, I’ll torture him. I am glad of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nTUBAL.\r\nOne of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nOut upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal. It was my turquoise, I had it\r\nof Leah when I was a bachelor. I would not have given it for a\r\nwilderness of monkeys.\r\n\r\nTUBAL.\r\nBut Antonio is certainly undone.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nNay, that’s true, that’s very true. Go, Tubal, fee me an officer;\r\nbespeak him a fortnight before. I will have the heart of him if he\r\nforfeit, for were he out of Venice I can make what merchandise I will.\r\nGo, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue. Go, good Tubal, at our\r\nsynagogue, Tubal.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. Belmont. A room in Portia’s house.\r\n\r\n Enter Bassanio, Portia, Gratiano, Nerissa and all their trains.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nI pray you tarry, pause a day or two\r\nBefore you hazard, for in choosing wrong\r\nI lose your company; therefore forbear a while.\r\nThere’s something tells me (but it is not love)\r\nI would not lose you, and you know yourself\r\nHate counsels not in such a quality.\r\nBut lest you should not understand me well,—\r\nAnd yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,—\r\nI would detain you here some month or two\r\nBefore you venture for me. I could teach you\r\nHow to choose right, but then I am forsworn.\r\nSo will I never be. So may you miss me.\r\nBut if you do, you’ll make me wish a sin,\r\nThat I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,\r\nThey have o’erlook’d me and divided me.\r\nOne half of me is yours, the other half yours,\r\nMine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,\r\nAnd so all yours. O these naughty times\r\nPuts bars between the owners and their rights!\r\nAnd so though yours, not yours. Prove it so,\r\nLet Fortune go to hell for it, not I.\r\nI speak too long, but ’tis to peise the time,\r\nTo eche it, and to draw it out in length,\r\nTo stay you from election.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nLet me choose,\r\nFor as I am, I live upon the rack.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nUpon the rack, Bassanio! Then confess\r\nWhat treason there is mingled with your love.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nNone but that ugly treason of mistrust,\r\nWhich makes me fear th’ enjoying of my love.\r\nThere may as well be amity and life\r\n’Tween snow and fire as treason and my love.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nAy, but I fear you speak upon the rack\r\nWhere men enforced do speak anything.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nPromise me life, and I’ll confess the truth.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nWell then, confess and live.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\n“Confess and love”\r\nHad been the very sum of my confession:\r\nO happy torment, when my torturer\r\nDoth teach me answers for deliverance!\r\nBut let me to my fortune and the caskets.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nAway, then! I am lock’d in one of them.\r\nIf you do love me, you will find me out.\r\nNerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.\r\nLet music sound while he doth make his choice.\r\nThen if he lose he makes a swan-like end,\r\nFading in music. That the comparison\r\nMay stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream\r\nAnd wat’ry death-bed for him. He may win,\r\nAnd what is music then? Then music is\r\nEven as the flourish when true subjects bow\r\nTo a new-crowned monarch. Such it is\r\nAs are those dulcet sounds in break of day\r\nThat creep into the dreaming bridegroom’s ear\r\nAnd summon him to marriage. Now he goes,\r\nWith no less presence, but with much more love\r\nThan young Alcides when he did redeem\r\nThe virgin tribute paid by howling Troy\r\nTo the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice;\r\nThe rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,\r\nWith bleared visages come forth to view\r\nThe issue of th’ exploit. Go, Hercules!\r\nLive thou, I live. With much much more dismay\r\nI view the fight than thou that mak’st the fray.\r\n\r\n A song, whilst Bassanio comments on the caskets to himself.\r\n\r\n _Tell me where is fancy bred,\r\n Or in the heart or in the head?\r\n How begot, how nourished?\r\n Reply, reply.\r\n It is engend’red in the eyes,\r\n With gazing fed, and fancy dies\r\n In the cradle where it lies.\r\n Let us all ring fancy’s knell:\r\n I’ll begin it.—Ding, dong, bell._\r\n\r\nALL.\r\n _Ding, dong, bell._\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nSo may the outward shows be least themselves.\r\nThe world is still deceiv’d with ornament.\r\nIn law, what plea so tainted and corrupt\r\nBut, being season’d with a gracious voice,\r\nObscures the show of evil? In religion,\r\nWhat damned error but some sober brow\r\nWill bless it, and approve it with a text,\r\nHiding the grossness with fair ornament?\r\nThere is no vice so simple but assumes\r\nSome mark of virtue on his outward parts.\r\nHow many cowards, whose hearts are all as false\r\nAs stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins\r\nThe beards of Hercules and frowning Mars,\r\nWho inward search’d, have livers white as milk,\r\nAnd these assume but valour’s excrement\r\nTo render them redoubted. Look on beauty,\r\nAnd you shall see ’tis purchas’d by the weight,\r\nWhich therein works a miracle in nature,\r\nMaking them lightest that wear most of it:\r\nSo are those crisped snaky golden locks\r\nWhich make such wanton gambols with the wind\r\nUpon supposed fairness, often known\r\nTo be the dowry of a second head,\r\nThe skull that bred them in the sepulchre.\r\nThus ornament is but the guiled shore\r\nTo a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf\r\nVeiling an Indian beauty; in a word,\r\nThe seeming truth which cunning times put on\r\nTo entrap the wisest. Therefore thou gaudy gold,\r\nHard food for Midas, I will none of thee,\r\nNor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge\r\n’Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead,\r\nWhich rather threaten’st than dost promise aught,\r\nThy palenness moves me more than eloquence,\r\nAnd here choose I, joy be the consequence!\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\n[_Aside._] How all the other passions fleet to air,\r\nAs doubtful thoughts, and rash-embrac’d despair,\r\nAnd shudd’ring fear, and green-ey’d jealousy.\r\nO love, be moderate; allay thy ecstasy,\r\nIn measure rain thy joy; scant this excess!\r\nI feel too much thy blessing, make it less,\r\nFor fear I surfeit.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nWhat find I here? [_Opening the leaden casket_.]\r\nFair Portia’s counterfeit! What demi-god\r\nHath come so near creation? Move these eyes?\r\nOr whether, riding on the balls of mine,\r\nSeem they in motion? Here are sever’d lips,\r\nParted with sugar breath, so sweet a bar\r\nShould sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs\r\nThe painter plays the spider, and hath woven\r\nA golden mesh t’entrap the hearts of men\r\nFaster than gnats in cobwebs. But her eyes!—\r\nHow could he see to do them? Having made one,\r\nMethinks it should have power to steal both his\r\nAnd leave itself unfurnish’d. Yet look how far\r\nThe substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow\r\nIn underprizing it, so far this shadow\r\nDoth limp behind the substance. Here’s the scroll,\r\nThe continent and summary of my fortune.\r\n\r\n _You that choose not by the view\r\n Chance as fair and choose as true!\r\n Since this fortune falls to you,\r\n Be content and seek no new.\r\n If you be well pleas’d with this,\r\n And hold your fortune for your bliss,\r\n Turn to where your lady is,\r\n And claim her with a loving kiss._\r\n\r\nA gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave, [_Kissing her_.]\r\nI come by note to give and to receive.\r\nLike one of two contending in a prize\r\nThat thinks he hath done well in people’s eyes,\r\nHearing applause and universal shout,\r\nGiddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt\r\nWhether those peals of praise be his or no,\r\nSo, thrice-fair lady, stand I even so,\r\nAs doubtful whether what I see be true,\r\nUntil confirm’d, sign’d, ratified by you.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nYou see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,\r\nSuch as I am; though for myself alone\r\nI would not be ambitious in my wish\r\nTo wish myself much better, yet for you\r\nI would be trebled twenty times myself,\r\nA thousand times more fair, ten thousand times\r\nMore rich,\r\nThat only to stand high in your account,\r\nI might in virtues, beauties, livings, friends,\r\nExceed account. But the full sum of me\r\nIs sum of something, which, to term in gross,\r\nIs an unlesson’d girl, unschool’d, unpractis’d;\r\nHappy in this, she is not yet so old\r\nBut she may learn; happier than this,\r\nShe is not bred so dull but she can learn;\r\nHappiest of all, is that her gentle spirit\r\nCommits itself to yours to be directed,\r\nAs from her lord, her governor, her king.\r\nMyself, and what is mine, to you and yours\r\nIs now converted. But now I was the lord\r\nOf this fair mansion, master of my servants,\r\nQueen o’er myself; and even now, but now,\r\nThis house, these servants, and this same myself\r\nAre yours,—my lord’s. I give them with this ring,\r\nWhich when you part from, lose, or give away,\r\nLet it presage the ruin of your love,\r\nAnd be my vantage to exclaim on you.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nMadam, you have bereft me of all words,\r\nOnly my blood speaks to you in my veins,\r\nAnd there is such confusion in my powers\r\nAs after some oration fairly spoke\r\nBy a beloved prince, there doth appear\r\nAmong the buzzing pleased multitude,\r\nWhere every something being blent together,\r\nTurns to a wild of nothing, save of joy\r\nExpress’d and not express’d. But when this ring\r\nParts from this finger, then parts life from hence.\r\nO then be bold to say Bassanio’s dead!\r\n\r\nNERISSA.\r\nMy lord and lady, it is now our time,\r\nThat have stood by and seen our wishes prosper,\r\nTo cry, good joy. Good joy, my lord and lady!\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nMy Lord Bassanio, and my gentle lady,\r\nI wish you all the joy that you can wish;\r\nFor I am sure you can wish none from me.\r\nAnd when your honours mean to solemnize\r\nThe bargain of your faith, I do beseech you\r\nEven at that time I may be married too.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nWith all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nI thank your lordship, you have got me one.\r\nMy eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:\r\nYou saw the mistress, I beheld the maid.\r\nYou lov’d, I lov’d; for intermission\r\nNo more pertains to me, my lord, than you.\r\nYour fortune stood upon the caskets there,\r\nAnd so did mine too, as the matter falls.\r\nFor wooing here until I sweat again,\r\nAnd swearing till my very roof was dry\r\nWith oaths of love, at last, (if promise last)\r\nI got a promise of this fair one here\r\nTo have her love, provided that your fortune\r\nAchiev’d her mistress.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nIs this true, Nerissa?\r\n\r\nNERISSA.\r\nMadam, it is, so you stand pleas’d withal.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nAnd do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nYes, faith, my lord.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nOur feast shall be much honoured in your marriage.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nWe’ll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats.\r\n\r\nNERISSA.\r\nWhat! and stake down?\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nNo, we shall ne’er win at that sport and stake down.\r\nBut who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel?\r\nWhat, and my old Venetian friend, Salerio!\r\n\r\n Enter Lorenzo, Jessica and Salerio.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nLorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither,\r\nIf that the youth of my new int’rest here\r\nHave power to bid you welcome. By your leave,\r\nI bid my very friends and countrymen,\r\nSweet Portia, welcome.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nSo do I, my lord,\r\nThey are entirely welcome.\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nI thank your honour. For my part, my lord,\r\nMy purpose was not to have seen you here,\r\nBut meeting with Salerio by the way,\r\nHe did entreat me, past all saying nay,\r\nTo come with him along.\r\n\r\nSALERIO.\r\nI did, my lord,\r\nAnd I have reason for it. Signior Antonio\r\nCommends him to you.\r\n\r\n [_Gives Bassanio a letter._]\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nEre I ope his letter,\r\nI pray you tell me how my good friend doth.\r\n\r\nSALERIO.\r\nNot sick, my lord, unless it be in mind,\r\nNor well, unless in mind. His letter there\r\nWill show you his estate.\r\n\r\n [_Bassanio opens the letter._]\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nNerissa, cheer yond stranger, bid her welcome.\r\nYour hand, Salerio. What’s the news from Venice?\r\nHow doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?\r\nI know he will be glad of our success.\r\nWe are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.\r\n\r\nSALERIO.\r\nI would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nThere are some shrewd contents in yond same paper\r\nThat steals the colour from Bassanio’s cheek.\r\nSome dear friend dead, else nothing in the world\r\nCould turn so much the constitution\r\nOf any constant man. What, worse and worse?\r\nWith leave, Bassanio, I am half yourself,\r\nAnd I must freely have the half of anything\r\nThat this same paper brings you.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nO sweet Portia,\r\nHere are a few of the unpleasant’st words\r\nThat ever blotted paper. Gentle lady,\r\nWhen I did first impart my love to you,\r\nI freely told you all the wealth I had\r\nRan in my veins, I was a gentleman.\r\nAnd then I told you true. And yet, dear lady,\r\nRating myself at nothing, you shall see\r\nHow much I was a braggart. When I told you\r\nMy state was nothing, I should then have told you\r\nThat I was worse than nothing; for indeed\r\nI have engag’d myself to a dear friend,\r\nEngag’d my friend to his mere enemy,\r\nTo feed my means. Here is a letter, lady,\r\nThe paper as the body of my friend,\r\nAnd every word in it a gaping wound\r\nIssuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?\r\nHath all his ventures fail’d? What, not one hit?\r\nFrom Tripolis, from Mexico, and England,\r\nFrom Lisbon, Barbary, and India,\r\nAnd not one vessel scape the dreadful touch\r\nOf merchant-marring rocks?\r\n\r\nSALERIO.\r\nNot one, my lord.\r\nBesides, it should appear, that if he had\r\nThe present money to discharge the Jew,\r\nHe would not take it. Never did I know\r\nA creature that did bear the shape of man\r\nSo keen and greedy to confound a man.\r\nHe plies the Duke at morning and at night,\r\nAnd doth impeach the freedom of the state\r\nIf they deny him justice. Twenty merchants,\r\nThe Duke himself, and the magnificoes\r\nOf greatest port have all persuaded with him,\r\nBut none can drive him from the envious plea\r\nOf forfeiture, of justice, and his bond.\r\n\r\nJESSICA.\r\nWhen I was with him, I have heard him swear\r\nTo Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,\r\nThat he would rather have Antonio’s flesh\r\nThan twenty times the value of the sum\r\nThat he did owe him. And I know, my lord,\r\nIf law, authority, and power deny not,\r\nIt will go hard with poor Antonio.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nIs it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nThe dearest friend to me, the kindest man,\r\nThe best condition’d and unwearied spirit\r\nIn doing courtesies, and one in whom\r\nThe ancient Roman honour more appears\r\nThan any that draws breath in Italy.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nWhat sum owes he the Jew?\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nFor me three thousand ducats.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nWhat, no more?\r\nPay him six thousand, and deface the bond.\r\nDouble six thousand, and then treble that,\r\nBefore a friend of this description\r\nShall lose a hair through Bassanio’s fault.\r\nFirst go with me to church and call me wife,\r\nAnd then away to Venice to your friend.\r\nFor never shall you lie by Portia’s side\r\nWith an unquiet soul. You shall have gold\r\nTo pay the petty debt twenty times over.\r\nWhen it is paid, bring your true friend along.\r\nMy maid Nerissa and myself meantime,\r\nWill live as maids and widows. Come, away!\r\nFor you shall hence upon your wedding day.\r\nBid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer;\r\nSince you are dear bought, I will love you dear.\r\nBut let me hear the letter of your friend.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\n_Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all miscarried, my creditors grow cruel,\r\nmy estate is very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit, and since in\r\npaying it, it is impossible I should live, all debts are clear’d\r\nbetween you and I, if I might but see you at my death. Notwithstanding,\r\nuse your pleasure. If your love do not persuade you to come, let not my\r\nletter._\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nO love, dispatch all business and be gone!\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nSince I have your good leave to go away,\r\nI will make haste; but, till I come again,\r\nNo bed shall e’er be guilty of my stay,\r\nNor rest be interposer ’twixt us twain.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. Venice. A street.\r\n\r\n Enter Shylock, Salarino, Antonio and Gaoler.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nGaoler, look to him. Tell not me of mercy.\r\nThis is the fool that lent out money gratis.\r\nGaoler, look to him.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nHear me yet, good Shylock.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nI’ll have my bond, speak not against my bond.\r\nI have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.\r\nThou call’dst me dog before thou hadst a cause,\r\nBut since I am a dog, beware my fangs;\r\nThe Duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder,\r\nThou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond\r\nTo come abroad with him at his request.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nI pray thee hear me speak.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nI’ll have my bond. I will not hear thee speak.\r\nI’ll have my bond, and therefore speak no more.\r\nI’ll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,\r\nTo shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield\r\nTo Christian intercessors. Follow not,\r\nI’ll have no speaking, I will have my bond.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSALARINO.\r\nIt is the most impenetrable cur\r\nThat ever kept with men.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nLet him alone.\r\nI’ll follow him no more with bootless prayers.\r\nHe seeks my life, his reason well I know:\r\nI oft deliver’d from his forfeitures\r\nMany that have at times made moan to me.\r\nTherefore he hates me.\r\n\r\nSALARINO.\r\nI am sure the Duke\r\nWill never grant this forfeiture to hold.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nThe Duke cannot deny the course of law,\r\nFor the commodity that strangers have\r\nWith us in Venice, if it be denied,\r\n’Twill much impeach the justice of the state,\r\nSince that the trade and profit of the city\r\nConsisteth of all nations. Therefore, go.\r\nThese griefs and losses have so bated me\r\nThat I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh\r\nTomorrow to my bloody creditor.\r\nWell, gaoler, on, pray God Bassanio come\r\nTo see me pay his debt, and then I care not.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV. Belmont. A room in Portia’s house.\r\n\r\n Enter Portia, Nerissa, Lorenzo, Jessica and Balthazar.\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nMadam, although I speak it in your presence,\r\nYou have a noble and a true conceit\r\nOf godlike amity, which appears most strongly\r\nIn bearing thus the absence of your lord.\r\nBut if you knew to whom you show this honour,\r\nHow true a gentleman you send relief,\r\nHow dear a lover of my lord your husband,\r\nI know you would be prouder of the work\r\nThan customary bounty can enforce you.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nI never did repent for doing good,\r\nNor shall not now; for in companions\r\nThat do converse and waste the time together,\r\nWhose souls do bear an equal yoke of love,\r\nThere must be needs a like proportion\r\nOf lineaments, of manners, and of spirit;\r\nWhich makes me think that this Antonio,\r\nBeing the bosom lover of my lord,\r\nMust needs be like my lord. If it be so,\r\nHow little is the cost I have bestowed\r\nIn purchasing the semblance of my soul\r\nFrom out the state of hellish cruelty!\r\nThis comes too near the praising of myself;\r\nTherefore no more of it. Hear other things.\r\nLorenzo, I commit into your hands\r\nThe husbandry and manage of my house\r\nUntil my lord’s return. For mine own part,\r\nI have toward heaven breath’d a secret vow\r\nTo live in prayer and contemplation,\r\nOnly attended by Nerissa here,\r\nUntil her husband and my lord’s return.\r\nThere is a monastery two miles off,\r\nAnd there we will abide. I do desire you\r\nNot to deny this imposition,\r\nThe which my love and some necessity\r\nNow lays upon you.\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nMadam, with all my heart\r\nI shall obey you in all fair commands.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nMy people do already know my mind,\r\nAnd will acknowledge you and Jessica\r\nIn place of Lord Bassanio and myself.\r\nSo fare you well till we shall meet again.\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nFair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!\r\n\r\nJESSICA.\r\nI wish your ladyship all heart’s content.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nI thank you for your wish, and am well pleas’d\r\nTo wish it back on you. Fare you well, Jessica.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Jessica and Lorenzo._]\r\n\r\nNow, Balthazar,\r\nAs I have ever found thee honest-true,\r\nSo let me find thee still. Take this same letter,\r\nAnd use thou all th’ endeavour of a man\r\nIn speed to Padua, see thou render this\r\nInto my cousin’s hands, Doctor Bellario;\r\nAnd look what notes and garments he doth give thee,\r\nBring them, I pray thee, with imagin’d speed\r\nUnto the traject, to the common ferry\r\nWhich trades to Venice. Waste no time in words,\r\nBut get thee gone. I shall be there before thee.\r\n\r\nBALTHAZAR.\r\nMadam, I go with all convenient speed.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nCome on, Nerissa, I have work in hand\r\nThat you yet know not of; we’ll see our husbands\r\nBefore they think of us.\r\n\r\nNERISSA.\r\nShall they see us?\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nThey shall, Nerissa, but in such a habit\r\nThat they shall think we are accomplished\r\nWith that we lack. I’ll hold thee any wager,\r\nWhen we are both accoutered like young men,\r\nI’ll prove the prettier fellow of the two,\r\nAnd wear my dagger with the braver grace,\r\nAnd speak between the change of man and boy\r\nWith a reed voice; and turn two mincing steps\r\nInto a manly stride; and speak of frays\r\nLike a fine bragging youth; and tell quaint lies\r\nHow honourable ladies sought my love,\r\nWhich I denying, they fell sick and died;\r\nI could not do withal. Then I’ll repent,\r\nAnd wish for all that, that I had not kill’d them.\r\nAnd twenty of these puny lies I’ll tell,\r\nThat men shall swear I have discontinued school\r\nAbout a twelvemonth. I have within my mind\r\nA thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,\r\nWhich I will practise.\r\n\r\nNERISSA.\r\nWhy, shall we turn to men?\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nFie, what a question’s that,\r\nIf thou wert near a lewd interpreter!\r\nBut come, I’ll tell thee all my whole device\r\nWhen I am in my coach, which stays for us\r\nAt the park gate; and therefore haste away,\r\nFor we must measure twenty miles today.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE V. The same. A garden.\r\n\r\n Enter Launcelet and Jessica.\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nYes, truly, for look you, the sins of the father are to be laid upon\r\nthe children, therefore, I promise you, I fear you. I was always plain\r\nwith you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter. Therefore be\r\nof good cheer, for truly I think you are damn’d. There is but one hope\r\nin it that can do you any good, and that is but a kind of bastard hope\r\nneither.\r\n\r\nJESSICA.\r\nAnd what hope is that, I pray thee?\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nMarry, you may partly hope that your father got you not, that you are\r\nnot the Jew’s daughter.\r\n\r\nJESSICA.\r\nThat were a kind of bastard hope indeed; so the sins of my mother\r\nshould be visited upon me.\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nTruly then I fear you are damn’d both by father and mother; thus when I\r\nshun Scylla your father, I fall into Charybdis your mother. Well, you\r\nare gone both ways.\r\n\r\nJESSICA.\r\nI shall be saved by my husband. He hath made me a Christian.\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nTruly the more to blame he, we were Christians enow before, e’en as\r\nmany as could well live one by another. This making of Christians will\r\nraise the price of hogs; if we grow all to be pork-eaters, we shall not\r\nshortly have a rasher on the coals for money.\r\n\r\n Enter Lorenzo.\r\n\r\nJESSICA.\r\nI’ll tell my husband, Launcelet, what you say. Here he comes.\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nI shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelet, if you thus get my wife\r\ninto corners!\r\n\r\nJESSICA.\r\nNay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo. Launcelet and I are out. He tells\r\nme flatly there’s no mercy for me in heaven, because I am a Jew’s\r\ndaughter; and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth, for\r\nin converting Jews to Christians you raise the price of pork.\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nI shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting\r\nup of the negro’s belly! The Moor is with child by you, Launcelet.\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nIt is much that the Moor should be more than reason; but if she be less\r\nthan an honest woman, she is indeed more than I took her for.\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nHow every fool can play upon the word! I think the best grace of wit\r\nwill shortly turn into silence, and discourse grow commendable in none\r\nonly but parrots. Go in, sirrah; bid them prepare for dinner.\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nThat is done, sir, they have all stomachs.\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nGoodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! Then bid them prepare dinner.\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nThat is done too, sir, only “cover” is the word.\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nWill you cover, then, sir?\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nNot so, sir, neither. I know my duty.\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nYet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show the whole wealth of\r\nthy wit in an instant? I pray thee understand a plain man in his plain\r\nmeaning: go to thy fellows, bid them cover the table, serve in the\r\nmeat, and we will come in to dinner.\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nFor the table, sir, it shall be served in; for the meat, sir, it shall\r\nbe covered; for your coming in to dinner, sir, why, let it be as\r\nhumours and conceits shall govern.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nO dear discretion, how his words are suited!\r\nThe fool hath planted in his memory\r\nAn army of good words, and I do know\r\nA many fools that stand in better place,\r\nGarnish’d like him, that for a tricksy word\r\nDefy the matter. How cheer’st thou, Jessica?\r\nAnd now, good sweet, say thy opinion,\r\nHow dost thou like the Lord Bassanio’s wife?\r\n\r\nJESSICA.\r\nPast all expressing. It is very meet\r\nThe Lord Bassanio live an upright life,\r\nFor having such a blessing in his lady,\r\nHe finds the joys of heaven here on earth,\r\nAnd if on earth he do not merit it,\r\nIn reason he should never come to heaven.\r\nWhy, if two gods should play some heavenly match,\r\nAnd on the wager lay two earthly women,\r\nAnd Portia one, there must be something else\r\nPawn’d with the other, for the poor rude world\r\nHath not her fellow.\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nEven such a husband\r\nHast thou of me as she is for a wife.\r\n\r\nJESSICA.\r\nNay, but ask my opinion too of that.\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nI will anon. First let us go to dinner.\r\n\r\nJESSICA.\r\nNay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nNo pray thee, let it serve for table-talk.\r\nThen howsome’er thou speak’st, ’mong other things\r\nI shall digest it.\r\n\r\nJESSICA.\r\nWell, I’ll set you forth.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\nACT IV\r\n\r\nSCENE I. Venice. A court of justice.\r\n\r\n Enter the Duke, the Magnificoes, Antonio, Bassanio, Gratiano, Salerio\r\n and others.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWhat, is Antonio here?\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nReady, so please your Grace.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nI am sorry for thee, thou art come to answer\r\nA stony adversary, an inhuman wretch,\r\nUncapable of pity, void and empty\r\nFrom any dram of mercy.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nI have heard\r\nYour Grace hath ta’en great pains to qualify\r\nHis rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate,\r\nAnd that no lawful means can carry me\r\nOut of his envy’s reach, I do oppose\r\nMy patience to his fury, and am arm’d\r\nTo suffer with a quietness of spirit\r\nThe very tyranny and rage of his.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nGo one and call the Jew into the court.\r\n\r\nSALARINO.\r\nHe is ready at the door. He comes, my lord.\r\n\r\n Enter Shylock.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nMake room, and let him stand before our face.\r\nShylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,\r\nThat thou but leadest this fashion of thy malice\r\nTo the last hour of act, and then, ’tis thought,\r\nThou’lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange\r\nThan is thy strange apparent cruelty;\r\nAnd where thou now exacts the penalty,\r\nWhich is a pound of this poor merchant’s flesh,\r\nThou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,\r\nBut, touch’d with human gentleness and love,\r\nForgive a moiety of the principal,\r\nGlancing an eye of pity on his losses\r\nThat have of late so huddled on his back,\r\nEnow to press a royal merchant down,\r\nAnd pluck commiseration of his state\r\nFrom brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,\r\nFrom stubborn Turks and Tartars never train’d\r\nTo offices of tender courtesy.\r\nWe all expect a gentle answer, Jew.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nI have possess’d your Grace of what I purpose,\r\nAnd by our holy Sabbath have I sworn\r\nTo have the due and forfeit of my bond.\r\nIf you deny it, let the danger light\r\nUpon your charter and your city’s freedom!\r\nYou’ll ask me why I rather choose to have\r\nA weight of carrion flesh than to receive\r\nThree thousand ducats. I’ll not answer that,\r\nBut say it is my humour. Is it answer’d?\r\nWhat if my house be troubled with a rat,\r\nAnd I be pleas’d to give ten thousand ducats\r\nTo have it ban’d? What, are you answer’d yet?\r\nSome men there are love not a gaping pig;\r\nSome that are mad if they behold a cat;\r\nAnd others, when the bagpipe sings i’ the nose,\r\nCannot contain their urine; for affection\r\nMistress of passion, sways it to the mood\r\nOf what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:\r\nAs there is no firm reason to be render’d\r\nWhy he cannot abide a gaping pig,\r\nWhy he a harmless necessary cat,\r\nWhy he a woollen bagpipe, but of force\r\nMust yield to such inevitable shame\r\nAs to offend, himself being offended,\r\nSo can I give no reason, nor I will not,\r\nMore than a lodg’d hate and a certain loathing\r\nI bear Antonio, that I follow thus\r\nA losing suit against him. Are you answered?\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nThis is no answer, thou unfeeling man,\r\nTo excuse the current of thy cruelty.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nI am not bound to please thee with my answer.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nDo all men kill the things they do not love?\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nHates any man the thing he would not kill?\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nEvery offence is not a hate at first.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nWhat, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nI pray you, think you question with the Jew.\r\nYou may as well go stand upon the beach\r\nAnd bid the main flood bate his usual height;\r\nYou may as well use question with the wolf,\r\nWhy he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;\r\nYou may as well forbid the mountain pines\r\nTo wag their high tops and to make no noise\r\nWhen they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;\r\nYou may as well do anything most hard\r\nAs seek to soften that—than which what’s harder?—\r\nHis Jewish heart. Therefore, I do beseech you,\r\nMake no moe offers, use no farther means,\r\nBut with all brief and plain conveniency.\r\nLet me have judgment, and the Jew his will.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nFor thy three thousand ducats here is six.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nIf every ducat in six thousand ducats\r\nWere in six parts, and every part a ducat,\r\nI would not draw them, I would have my bond.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nHow shalt thou hope for mercy, rend’ring none?\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nWhat judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?\r\nYou have among you many a purchas’d slave,\r\nWhich, like your asses and your dogs and mules,\r\nYou use in abject and in slavish parts,\r\nBecause you bought them. Shall I say to you\r\n“Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?\r\nWhy sweat they under burdens? Let their beds\r\nBe made as soft as yours, and let their palates\r\nBe season’d with such viands”? You will answer\r\n“The slaves are ours.” So do I answer you:\r\nThe pound of flesh which I demand of him\r\nIs dearly bought; ’tis mine and I will have it.\r\nIf you deny me, fie upon your law!\r\nThere is no force in the decrees of Venice.\r\nI stand for judgment. Answer; shall I have it?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nUpon my power I may dismiss this court,\r\nUnless Bellario, a learned doctor,\r\nWhom I have sent for to determine this,\r\nCome here today.\r\n\r\nSALARINO.\r\nMy lord, here stays without\r\nA messenger with letters from the doctor,\r\nNew come from Padua.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nBring us the letters. Call the messenger.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nGood cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!\r\nThe Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones, and all,\r\nEre thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nI am a tainted wether of the flock,\r\nMeetest for death, the weakest kind of fruit\r\nDrops earliest to the ground, and so let me.\r\nYou cannot better be employ’d, Bassanio,\r\nThan to live still, and write mine epitaph.\r\n\r\n Enter Nerissa dressed like a lawyer’s clerk.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nCame you from Padua, from Bellario?\r\n\r\nNERISSA.\r\nFrom both, my lord. Bellario greets your Grace.\r\n\r\n [_Presents a letter._]\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nWhy dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nTo cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nNot on thy sole but on thy soul, harsh Jew,\r\nThou mak’st thy knife keen. But no metal can,\r\nNo, not the hangman’s axe, bear half the keenness\r\nOf thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nNo, none that thou hast wit enough to make.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nO, be thou damn’d, inexecrable dog!\r\nAnd for thy life let justice be accus’d;\r\nThou almost mak’st me waver in my faith,\r\nTo hold opinion with Pythagoras\r\nThat souls of animals infuse themselves\r\nInto the trunks of men. Thy currish spirit\r\nGovern’d a wolf who, hang’d for human slaughter,\r\nEven from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,\r\nAnd whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed dam,\r\nInfus’d itself in thee; for thy desires\r\nAre wolfish, bloody, starv’d and ravenous.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nTill thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,\r\nThou but offend’st thy lungs to speak so loud.\r\nRepair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall\r\nTo cureless ruin. I stand here for law.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThis letter from Bellario doth commend\r\nA young and learned doctor to our court.\r\nWhere is he?\r\n\r\nNERISSA.\r\nHe attendeth here hard by,\r\nTo know your answer, whether you’ll admit him.\r\n\r\nDUKE OF VENICE.\r\nWith all my heart: some three or four of you\r\nGo give him courteous conduct to this place.\r\nMeantime, the court shall hear Bellario’s letter.\r\n\r\n[_Reads._] _Your Grace shall understand that at the receipt of your\r\nletter I am very sick, but in the instant that your messenger came, in\r\nloving visitation was with me a young doctor of Rome. His name is\r\nBalthazar. I acquainted him with the cause in controversy between the\r\nJew and Antonio the merchant. We turn’d o’er many books together. He is\r\nfurnished with my opinion, which, bettered with his own learning (the\r\ngreatness whereof I cannot enough commend), comes with him at my\r\nimportunity to fill up your Grace’s request in my stead. I beseech you\r\nlet his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend\r\nestimation, for I never knew so young a body with so old a head. I\r\nleave him to your gracious acceptance, whose trial shall better publish\r\nhis commendation._\r\n\r\nYou hear the learn’d Bellario what he writes,\r\nAnd here, I take it, is the doctor come.\r\n\r\n Enter Portia dressed like a doctor of laws.\r\n\r\nGive me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nI did, my lord.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nYou are welcome. Take your place.\r\nAre you acquainted with the difference\r\nThat holds this present question in the court?\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nI am informed throughly of the cause.\r\nWhich is the merchant here? And which the Jew?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nAntonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nIs your name Shylock?\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nShylock is my name.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nOf a strange nature is the suit you follow,\r\nYet in such rule that the Venetian law\r\nCannot impugn you as you do proceed.\r\n[_To Antonio_.] You stand within his danger, do you not?\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nAy, so he says.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nDo you confess the bond?\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nI do.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nThen must the Jew be merciful.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nOn what compulsion must I? Tell me that.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nThe quality of mercy is not strain’d,\r\nIt droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven\r\nUpon the place beneath. It is twice blest,\r\nIt blesseth him that gives and him that takes.\r\n’Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes\r\nThe throned monarch better than his crown.\r\nHis sceptre shows the force of temporal power,\r\nThe attribute to awe and majesty,\r\nWherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;\r\nBut mercy is above this sceptred sway,\r\nIt is enthroned in the hearts of kings,\r\nIt is an attribute to God himself;\r\nAnd earthly power doth then show likest God’s\r\nWhen mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,\r\nThough justice be thy plea, consider this,\r\nThat in the course of justice none of us\r\nShould see salvation. We do pray for mercy,\r\nAnd that same prayer doth teach us all to render\r\nThe deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much\r\nTo mitigate the justice of thy plea,\r\nWhich if thou follow, this strict court of Venice\r\nMust needs give sentence ’gainst the merchant there.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nMy deeds upon my head! I crave the law,\r\nThe penalty and forfeit of my bond.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nIs he not able to discharge the money?\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nYes, here I tender it for him in the court,\r\nYea, twice the sum, if that will not suffice,\r\nI will be bound to pay it ten times o’er\r\nOn forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart.\r\nIf this will not suffice, it must appear\r\nThat malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,\r\nWrest once the law to your authority.\r\nTo do a great right, do a little wrong,\r\nAnd curb this cruel devil of his will.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nIt must not be, there is no power in Venice\r\nCan alter a decree established;\r\n’Twill be recorded for a precedent,\r\nAnd many an error by the same example\r\nWill rush into the state. It cannot be.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nA Daniel come to judgment! Yea, a Daniel!\r\nO wise young judge, how I do honour thee!\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nI pray you let me look upon the bond.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nHere ’tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nShylock, there’s thrice thy money offered thee.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nAn oath, an oath! I have an oath in heaven.\r\nShall I lay perjury upon my soul?\r\nNo, not for Venice.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nWhy, this bond is forfeit,\r\nAnd lawfully by this the Jew may claim\r\nA pound of flesh, to be by him cut off\r\nNearest the merchant’s heart. Be merciful,\r\nTake thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nWhen it is paid according to the tenour.\r\nIt doth appear you are a worthy judge;\r\nYou know the law; your exposition\r\nHath been most sound. I charge you by the law,\r\nWhereof you are a well-deserving pillar,\r\nProceed to judgment. By my soul I swear\r\nThere is no power in the tongue of man\r\nTo alter me. I stay here on my bond.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nMost heartily I do beseech the court\r\nTo give the judgment.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nWhy then, thus it is:\r\nYou must prepare your bosom for his knife.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nO noble judge! O excellent young man!\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nFor the intent and purpose of the law\r\nHath full relation to the penalty,\r\nWhich here appeareth due upon the bond.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\n’Tis very true. O wise and upright judge,\r\nHow much more elder art thou than thy looks!\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nTherefore lay bare your bosom.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nAy, his breast\r\nSo says the bond, doth it not, noble judge?\r\n“Nearest his heart”: those are the very words.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nIt is so. Are there balance here to weigh\r\nThe flesh?\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nI have them ready.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nHave by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,\r\nTo stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nIs it so nominated in the bond?\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nIt is not so express’d, but what of that?\r\n’Twere good you do so much for charity.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nI cannot find it; ’tis not in the bond.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nYou, merchant, have you anything to say?\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nBut little. I am arm’d and well prepar’d.\r\nGive me your hand, Bassanio. Fare you well,\r\nGrieve not that I am fallen to this for you,\r\nFor herein Fortune shows herself more kind\r\nThan is her custom: it is still her use\r\nTo let the wretched man outlive his wealth,\r\nTo view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow\r\nAn age of poverty, from which ling’ring penance\r\nOf such misery doth she cut me off.\r\nCommend me to your honourable wife,\r\nTell her the process of Antonio’s end,\r\nSay how I lov’d you, speak me fair in death.\r\nAnd when the tale is told, bid her be judge\r\nWhether Bassanio had not once a love.\r\nRepent but you that you shall lose your friend\r\nAnd he repents not that he pays your debt.\r\nFor if the Jew do cut but deep enough,\r\nI’ll pay it instantly with all my heart.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nAntonio, I am married to a wife\r\nWhich is as dear to me as life itself,\r\nBut life itself, my wife, and all the world,\r\nAre not with me esteem’d above thy life.\r\nI would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all\r\nHere to this devil, to deliver you.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nYour wife would give you little thanks for that\r\nIf she were by to hear you make the offer.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nI have a wife who I protest I love.\r\nI would she were in heaven, so she could\r\nEntreat some power to change this currish Jew.\r\n\r\nNERISSA.\r\n’Tis well you offer it behind her back,\r\nThe wish would make else an unquiet house.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nThese be the Christian husbands! I have a daughter—\r\nWould any of the stock of Barabbas\r\nHad been her husband, rather than a Christian!\r\nWe trifle time, I pray thee, pursue sentence.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nA pound of that same merchant’s flesh is thine,\r\nThe court awards it and the law doth give it.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nMost rightful judge!\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nAnd you must cut this flesh from off his breast.\r\nThe law allows it and the court awards it.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nMost learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nTarry a little, there is something else.\r\nThis bond doth give thee here no jot of blood.\r\nThe words expressly are “a pound of flesh”:\r\nTake then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh,\r\nBut in the cutting it, if thou dost shed\r\nOne drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods\r\nAre, by the laws of Venice, confiscate\r\nUnto the state of Venice.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nO upright judge! Mark, Jew. O learned judge!\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nIs that the law?\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nThyself shalt see the act.\r\nFor, as thou urgest justice, be assur’d\r\nThou shalt have justice more than thou desir’st.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nO learned judge! Mark, Jew, a learned judge!\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nI take this offer then. Pay the bond thrice\r\nAnd let the Christian go.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nHere is the money.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nSoft!\r\nThe Jew shall have all justice.

What dost thou say?\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nI am content.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nClerk, draw a deed of gift.\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK.\r\nI pray you give me leave to go from hence;\r\nI am not well; send the deed after me\r\nAnd I will sign it.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nGet thee gone, but do it.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nIn christ’ning shalt thou have two god-fathers.\r\nHad I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more,\r\nTo bring thee to the gallows, not to the font.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Shylock._]\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nSir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nI humbly do desire your Grace of pardon,\r\nI must away this night toward Padua,\r\nAnd it is meet I presently set forth.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nI am sorry that your leisure serves you not.\r\nAntonio, gratify this gentleman,\r\nFor in my mind you are much bound to him.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Duke and his train._]\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nMost worthy gentleman, I and my friend\r\nHave by your wisdom been this day acquitted\r\nOf grievous penalties, in lieu whereof,\r\nThree thousand ducats due unto the Jew\r\nWe freely cope your courteous pains withal.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nAnd stand indebted, over and above\r\nIn love and service to you evermore.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nHe is well paid that is well satisfied,\r\nAnd I delivering you, am satisfied,\r\nAnd therein do account myself well paid,\r\nMy mind was never yet more mercenary.\r\nI pray you know me when we meet again,\r\nI wish you well, and so I take my leave.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nDear sir, of force I must attempt you further.\r\nTake some remembrance of us as a tribute,\r\nNot as fee. Grant me two things, I pray you,\r\nNot to deny me, and to pardon me.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nYou press me far, and therefore I will yield.\r\n[_To Antonio_.] Give me your gloves, I’ll wear them for your sake.\r\n[_To Bassanio_.] And, for your love, I’ll take this ring from you.\r\nDo not draw back your hand; I’ll take no more,\r\nAnd you in love shall not deny me this.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nThis ring, good sir? Alas, it is a trifle,\r\nI will not shame myself to give you this.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nI will have nothing else but only this,\r\nAnd now methinks I have a mind to it.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nThere’s more depends on this than on the value.\r\nThe dearest ring in Venice will I give you,\r\nAnd find it out by proclamation,\r\nOnly for this I pray you pardon me.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nI see, sir, you are liberal in offers.\r\nYou taught me first to beg, and now methinks\r\nYou teach me how a beggar should be answer’d.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nGood sir, this ring was given me by my wife,\r\nAnd when she put it on, she made me vow\r\nThat I should neither sell, nor give, nor lose it.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nThat ’scuse serves many men to save their gifts.\r\nAnd if your wife be not a mad-woman,\r\nAnd know how well I have deserv’d this ring,\r\nShe would not hold out enemy for ever\r\nFor giving it to me. Well, peace be with you!\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Portia and Nerissa._]\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nMy Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring.\r\nLet his deservings and my love withal\r\nBe valued ’gainst your wife’s commandment.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nGo, Gratiano, run and overtake him;\r\nGive him the ring, and bring him if thou canst\r\nUnto Antonio’s house. Away, make haste.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Gratiano._]\r\n\r\nCome, you and I will thither presently,\r\nAnd in the morning early will we both\r\nFly toward Belmont. Come, Antonio.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. The same.

Furthermore,\r\nI pray you show my youth old Shylock’s house.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nThat will I do.\r\n\r\nNERISSA.\r\nSir, I would speak with you.\r\n[_Aside to Portia_.]\r\nI’ll see if I can get my husband’s ring,\r\nWhich I did make him swear to keep for ever.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\n[_To Nerissa_.] Thou mayst, I warrant. We shall have old swearing\r\nThat they did give the rings away to men;\r\nBut we’ll outface them, and outswear them too.\r\nAway! make haste! Thou know’st where I will tarry.\r\n\r\nNERISSA.\r\nCome, good sir, will you show me to this house?\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\nACT V\r\n\r\nSCENE I. Belmont. The avenue to Portia’s house.\r\n\r\n Enter Lorenzo and Jessica.\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nThe moon shines bright. In such a night as this,\r\nWhen the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees,\r\nAnd they did make no noise, in such a night,\r\nTroilus methinks mounted the Trojan walls,\r\nAnd sigh’d his soul toward the Grecian tents\r\nWhere Cressid lay that night.\r\n\r\nJESSICA.\r\nIn such a night\r\nDid Thisbe fearfully o’ertrip the dew,\r\nAnd saw the lion’s shadow ere himself,\r\nAnd ran dismay’d away.\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nIn such a night\r\nStood Dido with a willow in her hand\r\nUpon the wild sea-banks, and waft her love\r\nTo come again to Carthage.\r\n\r\nJESSICA.\r\nIn such a night\r\nMedea gathered the enchanted herbs\r\nThat did renew old Æson.\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nIn such a night\r\nDid Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew,\r\nAnd with an unthrift love did run from Venice\r\nAs far as Belmont.\r\n\r\nJESSICA.\r\nIn such a night\r\nDid young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,\r\nStealing her soul with many vows of faith,\r\nAnd ne’er a true one.\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nIn such a night\r\nDid pretty Jessica, like a little shrew,\r\nSlander her love, and he forgave it her.\r\n\r\nJESSICA.\r\nI would out-night you did no body come;\r\nBut hark, I hear the footing of a man.\r\n\r\n Enter Stephano.\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nWho comes so fast in silence of the night?\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nA friend.\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nA friend! What friend? Your name, I pray you, friend?\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nStephano is my name, and I bring word\r\nMy mistress will before the break of day\r\nBe here at Belmont. She doth stray about\r\nBy holy crosses where she kneels and prays\r\nFor happy wedlock hours.\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nWho comes with her?\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nNone but a holy hermit and her maid.\r\nI pray you is my master yet return’d?\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nHe is not, nor we have not heard from him.\r\nBut go we in, I pray thee, Jessica,\r\nAnd ceremoniously let us prepare\r\nSome welcome for the mistress of the house.\r\n\r\n Enter Launcelet.\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET. Sola, sola! wo ha, ho! sola, sola!\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nWho calls?\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nSola! Did you see Master Lorenzo? Master Lorenzo! Sola, sola!\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nLeave holloaing, man. Here!\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nSola! Where, where?\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nHere!\r\n\r\nLAUNCELET.\r\nTell him there’s a post come from my master with his horn full of good\r\nnews. My master will be here ere morning.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nSweet soul, let’s in, and there expect their coming.\r\nAnd yet no matter; why should we go in?\r\nMy friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,\r\nWithin the house, your mistress is at hand,\r\nAnd bring your music forth into the air.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Stephano._]\r\n\r\nHow sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!\r\nHere will we sit and let the sounds of music\r\nCreep in our ears; soft stillness and the night\r\nBecome the touches of sweet harmony.\r\nSit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven\r\nIs thick inlaid with patens of bright gold.\r\nThere’s not the smallest orb which thou behold’st\r\nBut in his motion like an angel sings,\r\nStill quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;\r\nSuch harmony is in immortal souls,\r\nBut whilst this muddy vesture of decay\r\nDoth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.\r\n\r\n Enter Musicians.\r\n\r\nCome, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn.\r\nWith sweetest touches pierce your mistress’ ear,\r\nAnd draw her home with music.\r\n\r\n [_Music._]\r\n\r\nJESSICA.\r\nI am never merry when I hear sweet music.\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nThe reason is, your spirits are attentive.\r\nFor do but note a wild and wanton herd\r\nOr race of youthful and unhandled colts,\r\nFetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,\r\nWhich is the hot condition of their blood,\r\nIf they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,\r\nOr any air of music touch their ears,\r\nYou shall perceive them make a mutual stand,\r\nTheir savage eyes turn’d to a modest gaze\r\nBy the sweet power of music: therefore the poet\r\nDid feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and floods,\r\nSince naught so stockish, hard, and full of rage,\r\nBut music for the time doth change his nature.\r\nThe man that hath no music in himself,\r\nNor is not mov’d with concord of sweet sounds,\r\nIs fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils;\r\nThe motions of his spirit are dull as night,\r\nAnd his affections dark as Erebus.\r\nLet no such man be trusted. Mark the music.\r\n\r\n Enter Portia and Nerissa.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nThat light we see is burning in my hall.\r\nHow far that little candle throws his beams!\r\nSo shines a good deed in a naughty world.\r\n\r\nNERISSA.\r\nWhen the moon shone we did not see the candle.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nSo doth the greater glory dim the less.\r\nA substitute shines brightly as a king\r\nUntil a king be by, and then his state\r\nEmpties itself, as doth an inland brook\r\nInto the main of waters. Music! hark!\r\n\r\nNERISSA.\r\nIt is your music, madam, of the house.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nNothing is good, I see, without respect.\r\nMethinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.\r\n\r\nNERISSA.\r\nSilence bestows that virtue on it, madam.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nThe crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark\r\nWhen neither is attended; and I think\r\nThe nightingale, if she should sing by day\r\nWhen every goose is cackling, would be thought\r\nNo better a musician than the wren.\r\nHow many things by season season’d are\r\nTo their right praise and true perfection!\r\nPeace! How the moon sleeps with Endymion,\r\nAnd would not be awak’d!\r\n\r\n [_Music ceases._]\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nThat is the voice,\r\nOr I am much deceiv’d, of Portia.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nHe knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,\r\nBy the bad voice.\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nDear lady, welcome home.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nWe have been praying for our husbands’ welfare,\r\nWhich speed, we hope, the better for our words.\r\nAre they return’d?\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nMadam, they are not yet;\r\nBut there is come a messenger before\r\nTo signify their coming.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nGo in, Nerissa.\r\nGive order to my servants, that they take\r\nNo note at all of our being absent hence,\r\nNor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you.\r\n\r\n [_A tucket sounds._]\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nYour husband is at hand, I hear his trumpet.\r\nWe are no tell-tales, madam, fear you not.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nThis night methinks is but the daylight sick,\r\nIt looks a little paler. ’Tis a day\r\nSuch as the day is when the sun is hid.\r\n\r\n Enter Bassanio, Antonio, Gratiano and their Followers.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nWe should hold day with the Antipodes,\r\nIf you would walk in absence of the sun.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nLet me give light, but let me not be light,\r\nFor a light wife doth make a heavy husband,\r\nAnd never be Bassanio so for me.\r\nBut God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nI thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend.\r\nThis is the man, this is Antonio,\r\nTo whom I am so infinitely bound.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nYou should in all sense be much bound to him,\r\nFor, as I hear, he was much bound for you.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nNo more than I am well acquitted of.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nSir, you are very welcome to our house.\r\nIt must appear in other ways than words,\r\nTherefore I scant this breathing courtesy.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\n[_To Nerissa_.] By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong,\r\nIn faith, I gave it to the judge’s clerk.\r\nWould he were gelt that had it, for my part,\r\nSince you do take it, love, so much at heart.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nA quarrel, ho, already! What’s the matter?\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nAbout a hoop of gold, a paltry ring\r\nThat she did give me, whose posy was\r\nFor all the world like cutlers’ poetry\r\nUpon a knife, “Love me, and leave me not.”\r\n\r\nNERISSA.\r\nWhat talk you of the posy, or the value?\r\nYou swore to me when I did give it you,\r\nThat you would wear it till your hour of death,\r\nAnd that it should lie with you in your grave.\r\nThough not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,\r\nYou should have been respective and have kept it.\r\nGave it a judge’s clerk! No, God’s my judge,\r\nThe clerk will ne’er wear hair on’s face that had it.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nHe will, and if he live to be a man.\r\n\r\nNERISSA.\r\nAy, if a woman live to be a man.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nNow, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,\r\nA kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,\r\nNo higher than thyself, the judge’s clerk,\r\nA prating boy that begg’d it as a fee,\r\nI could not for my heart deny it him.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nYou were to blame,—I must be plain with you,—\r\nTo part so slightly with your wife’s first gift,\r\nA thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger,\r\nAnd so riveted with faith unto your flesh.\r\nI gave my love a ring, and made him swear\r\nNever to part with it, and here he stands.\r\nI dare be sworn for him he would not leave it\r\nNor pluck it from his finger for the wealth\r\nThat the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,\r\nYou give your wife too unkind a cause of grief,\r\nAn ’twere to me I should be mad at it.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\n[_Aside._] Why, I were best to cut my left hand off,\r\nAnd swear I lost the ring defending it.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nMy Lord Bassanio gave his ring away\r\nUnto the judge that begg’d it, and indeed\r\nDeserv’d it too. And then the boy, his clerk,\r\nThat took some pains in writing, he begg’d mine,\r\nAnd neither man nor master would take aught\r\nBut the two rings.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nWhat ring gave you, my lord?\r\nNot that, I hope, which you receiv’d of me.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nIf I could add a lie unto a fault,\r\nI would deny it, but you see my finger\r\nHath not the ring upon it, it is gone.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nEven so void is your false heart of truth.\r\nBy heaven, I will ne’er come in your bed\r\nUntil I see the ring.\r\n\r\nNERISSA.\r\nNor I in yours\r\nTill I again see mine!\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nSweet Portia,\r\nIf you did know to whom I gave the ring,\r\nIf you did know for whom I gave the ring,\r\nAnd would conceive for what I gave the ring,\r\nAnd how unwillingly I left the ring,\r\nWhen nought would be accepted but the ring,\r\nYou would abate the strength of your displeasure.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nIf you had known the virtue of the ring,\r\nOr half her worthiness that gave the ring,\r\nOr your own honour to contain the ring,\r\nYou would not then have parted with the ring.\r\nWhat man is there so much unreasonable,\r\nIf you had pleas’d to have defended it\r\nWith any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty\r\nTo urge the thing held as a ceremony?\r\nNerissa teaches me what to believe:\r\nI’ll die for’t but some woman had the ring.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nNo, by my honour, madam, by my soul,\r\nNo woman had it, but a civil doctor,\r\nWhich did refuse three thousand ducats of me,\r\nAnd begg’d the ring, the which I did deny him,\r\nAnd suffer’d him to go displeas’d away,\r\nEven he that had held up the very life\r\nOf my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?\r\nI was enforc’d to send it after him.\r\nI was beset with shame and courtesy.\r\nMy honour would not let ingratitude\r\nSo much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady;\r\nFor by these blessed candles of the night,\r\nHad you been there, I think you would have begg’d\r\nThe ring of me to give the worthy doctor.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nLet not that doctor e’er come near my house,\r\nSince he hath got the jewel that I loved,\r\nAnd that which you did swear to keep for me,\r\nI will become as liberal as you,\r\nI’ll not deny him anything I have,\r\nNo, not my body, nor my husband’s bed.\r\nKnow him I shall, I am well sure of it.\r\nLie not a night from home. Watch me like Argus,\r\nIf you do not, if I be left alone,\r\nNow by mine honour which is yet mine own,\r\nI’ll have that doctor for mine bedfellow.\r\n\r\nNERISSA.\r\nAnd I his clerk. Therefore be well advis’d\r\nHow you do leave me to mine own protection.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nWell, do you so. Let not me take him then,\r\nFor if I do, I’ll mar the young clerk’s pen.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nI am th’ unhappy subject of these quarrels.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nSir, grieve not you. You are welcome notwithstanding.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nPortia, forgive me this enforced wrong,\r\nAnd in the hearing of these many friends\r\nI swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,\r\nWherein I see myself—\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nMark you but that!\r\nIn both my eyes he doubly sees himself,\r\nIn each eye one. Swear by your double self,\r\nAnd there’s an oath of credit.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nNay, but hear me.\r\nPardon this fault, and by my soul I swear\r\nI never more will break an oath with thee.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nI once did lend my body for his wealth,\r\nWhich but for him that had your husband’s ring\r\nHad quite miscarried. I dare be bound again,\r\nMy soul upon the forfeit, that your lord\r\nWill never more break faith advisedly.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nThen you shall be his surety. Give him this,\r\nAnd bid him keep it better than the other.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nHere, Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nBy heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nI had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio,\r\nFor by this ring, the doctor lay with me.\r\n\r\nNERISSA.\r\nAnd pardon me, my gentle Gratiano,\r\nFor that same scrubbed boy, the doctor’s clerk,\r\nIn lieu of this, last night did lie with me.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nWhy, this is like the mending of highways\r\nIn summer, where the ways are fair enough.\r\nWhat, are we cuckolds ere we have deserv’d it?\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nSpeak not so grossly. You are all amaz’d.\r\nHere is a letter; read it at your leisure.\r\nIt comes from Padua from Bellario.\r\nThere you shall find that Portia was the doctor,\r\nNerissa there, her clerk. Lorenzo here\r\nShall witness I set forth as soon as you,\r\nAnd even but now return’d. I have not yet\r\nEnter’d my house. Antonio, you are welcome,\r\nAnd I have better news in store for you\r\nThan you expect: unseal this letter soon.\r\nThere you shall find three of your argosies\r\nAre richly come to harbour suddenly.\r\nYou shall not know by what strange accident\r\nI chanced on this letter.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nI am dumb.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nWere you the doctor, and I knew you not?\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nWere you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?\r\n\r\nNERISSA.\r\nAy, but the clerk that never means to do it,\r\nUnless he live until he be a man.\r\n\r\nBASSANIO.\r\nSweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow.\r\nWhen I am absent, then lie with my wife.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nSweet lady, you have given me life and living;\r\nFor here I read for certain that my ships\r\nAre safely come to road.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nHow now, Lorenzo!\r\nMy clerk hath some good comforts too for you.\r\n\r\nNERISSA.\r\nAy, and I’ll give them him without a fee.\r\nThere do I give to you and Jessica,\r\nFrom the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,\r\nAfter his death, of all he dies possess’d of.\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\r\nFair ladies, you drop manna in the way\r\nOf starved people.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nIt is almost morning,\r\nAnd yet I am sure you are not satisfied\r\nOf these events at full. Let us go in,\r\nAnd charge us there upon inter’gatories,\r\nAnd we will answer all things faithfully.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nLet it be so. The first inter’gatory\r\nThat my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,\r\nWhether till the next night she had rather stay,\r\nOr go to bed now, being two hours to day.\r\nBut were the day come, I should wish it dark\r\nTill I were couching with the doctor’s clerk.\r\nWell, while I live, I’ll fear no other thing\r\nSo sore as keeping safe Nerissa’s ring.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\nTHE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR\r\n\nContents\r\n\r\n ACT I\r\n Scene I.

Good cabbage!—Slender, I broke your head. What matter have\r\nyou against me?\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nMarry, sir, I have matter in my head against you, and against your\r\ncony-catching rascals, Bardolph, Nym, and Pistol. They carried me to\r\nthe tavern and made me drunk, and afterwards picked my pocket.\r\n\r\nBARDOLPH.\r\nYou Banbury cheese!\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nAy, it is no matter.\r\n\r\nPISTOL.\r\nHow now, Mephostophilus?\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nAy, it is no matter.\r\n\r\nNYM.\r\nSlice, I say! _Pauca, pauca_, slice, that’s my humour.\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nWhere’s Simple, my man? Can you tell, cousin?\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nPeace, I pray you. Now let us understand; there is three umpires in\r\nthis matter, as I understand: that is, Master Page, _fidelicet_ Master\r\nPage; and there is myself, _fidelicet_ myself; and the three party is,\r\nlastly and finally, mine host of the Garter.\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nWe three to hear it and end it between them.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nFery goot. I will make a prief of it in my notebook, and we will\r\nafterwards ’ork upon the cause with as great discreetly as we can.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nPistol!\r\n\r\nPISTOL.\r\nHe hears with ears.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nThe tevil and his tam! What phrase is this, “He hears with ear”? Why,\r\nit is affectations.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nPistol, did you pick Master Slender’s purse?\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nAy, by these gloves, did he, or I would I might never come in mine own\r\ngreat chamber again else! Of seven groats in mill-sixpences, and two\r\nEdward shovel-boards that cost me two shilling and two pence a-piece of\r\nYed Miller, by these gloves.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nIs this true, Pistol?\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nNo, it is false, if it is a pick-purse.\r\n\r\nPISTOL.\r\nHa, thou mountain-foreigner!—Sir John and master mine,\r\nI combat challenge of this latten bilbo.—\r\nWord of denial in thy _labras_ here!\r\nWord of denial! Froth and scum, thou liest.\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\n[_Points at Nym_.] By these gloves, then, ’twas he.\r\n\r\nNYM.\r\nBe avised, sir, and pass good humours. I will say “marry trap with\r\nyou”, if you run the nuthook’s humour on me. That is the very note of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nBy this hat, then, he in the red face had it. For though I cannot\r\nremember what I did when you made me drunk, yet I am not altogether an\r\nass.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nWhat say you, Scarlet and John?\r\n\r\nBARDOLPH.\r\nWhy, sir, for my part, I say the gentleman had drunk himself out of his\r\nfive sentences.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nIt is his “five senses”. Fie, what the ignorance is!\r\n\r\nBARDOLPH.\r\nAnd being fap, sir, was, as they say, cashiered; and so conclusions\r\npassed the careers.\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nAy, you spake in Latin then too; but ’tis no matter. I’ll ne’er be\r\ndrunk whilst I live again, but in honest, civil, godly company, for\r\nthis trick. If I be drunk, I’ll be drunk with those that have the fear\r\nof God, and not with drunken knaves.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nSo Got ’udge me, that is a virtuous mind.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nYou hear all these matters denied, gentlemen; you hear it.\r\n\r\nEnter Mistress Ford, Mistress Page and her daughter Anne Page with\r\nwine.\r\n\r\nPAGE\r\nNay, daughter, carry the wine in, we’ll drink within.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Anne Page._]\r\n\r\nSLENDER\r\nO heaven, this is Mistress Anne Page.\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nHow now, Mistress Ford?\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nMistress Ford, by my troth, you are very well met. By your leave, good\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\n[_Kisses her._]\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nWife, bid these gentlemen welcome. Come, we have a hot venison pasty to\r\ndinner. Come, gentlemen, I hope we shall drink down all unkindness.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt all but Slender._]\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nI had rather than forty shillings I had my book of _Songs and Sonnets_\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nEnter Simple.\r\n\r\nHow now, Simple, where have you been? I must wait on myself, must I?\r\nYou have not the _Book of Riddles_ about you, have you?\r\n\r\nSIMPLE.\r\n_Book of Riddles?_ Why, did you not lend it to Alice Shortcake upon\r\nAllhallowmas last, a fortnight afore Michaelmas?\r\n\r\nEnter Shallow and Sir Hugh Evans.\r\n\r\nSHALLOW.\r\nCome, coz; come, coz, we stay for you. A word with you, coz. Marry,\r\nthis, coz: there is, as ’twere, a tender, a kind of tender, made afar\r\noff by Sir Hugh here. Do you understand me?\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nAy, sir, you shall find me reasonable. If it be so, I shall do that\r\nthat is reason.\r\n\r\nSHALLOW.\r\nNay, but understand me.\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nSo I do, sir.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nGive ear to his motions, Master Slender. I will description the matter\r\nto you, if you be capacity of it.\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nNay, I will do as my cousin Shallow says. I pray you pardon me, he’s a\r\nJustice of Peace in his country, simple though I stand here.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nBut that is not the question. The question is concerning your marriage.\r\n\r\nSHALLOW.\r\nAy, there’s the point, sir.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nMarry, is it; the very point of it—to Mistress Anne Page.\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nWhy, if it be so, I will marry her upon any reasonable demands.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nBut can you affection the ’oman? Let us command to know that of your\r\nmouth, or of your lips; for divers philosophers hold that the lips is\r\nparcel of the mouth. Therefore, precisely, can you carry your good will\r\nto the maid?\r\n\r\nSHALLOW.\r\nCousin Abraham Slender, can you love her?\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nI hope, sir, I will do as it shall become one that would do reason.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nNay, Got’s lords and his ladies! You must speak possitable, if you can\r\ncarry her your desires towards her.\r\n\r\nSHALLOW.\r\nThat you must. Will you, upon good dowry, marry her?\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nI will do a greater thing than that, upon your request, cousin, in any\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nSHALLOW.\r\nNay, conceive me, conceive me, sweet coz. What I do is to pleasure you,\r\ncoz. Can you love the maid?\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nI will marry her, sir, at your request. But if there be no great love\r\nin the beginning, yet heaven may decrease it upon better acquaintance,\r\nwhen we are married and have more occasion to know one another. I hope\r\nupon familiarity will grow more contempt. But if you say “Marry her,” I\r\nwill marry her. That I am freely dissolved, and dissolutely.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nIt is a fery discretion answer, save the fall is in the ’ord\r\n“dissolutely.” The ’ort is, according to our meaning, “resolutely.” His\r\nmeaning is good.\r\n\r\nSHALLOW.\r\nAy, I think my cousin meant well.\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nAy, or else I would I might be hanged, la!\r\n\r\nSHALLOW.\r\nHere comes fair Mistress Anne.\r\n\r\nEnter Anne Page.\r\n\r\nSHALLOW.\r\nHere comes fair Mistress Anne.—Would I were young for your sake,\r\nMistress Anne.\r\n\r\nANNE.\r\nThe dinner is on the table, my father desires your worships’ company.\r\n\r\nSHALLOW.\r\nI will wait on him, fair Mistress Anne.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\n’Od’s plessed will! I will not be absence at the grace.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Shallow and Sir Hugh Evans._]\r\n\r\nANNE\r\nWill’t please your worship to come in, sir?\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nNo, I thank you, forsooth, heartily; I am very well.\r\n\r\nANNE.\r\nThe dinner attends you, sir.\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nI am not a-hungry, I thank you, forsooth. [_To Simple_.] Go, sirrah,\r\nfor all you are my man, go wait upon my cousin Shallow.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Simple._]\r\n\r\nA Justice of Peace sometime may be beholding to his friend for a man. I\r\nkeep but three men and a boy yet, till my mother be dead. But what\r\nthough? Yet I live like a poor gentleman born.\r\n\r\nANNE.\r\nI may not go in without your worship. They will not sit till you come.\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nI’ faith, I’ll eat nothing. I thank you as much as though I did.\r\n\r\nANNE.\r\nI pray you, sir, walk in.\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nI had rather walk here, I thank you. I bruised my shin th’ other day\r\nwith playing at sword and dagger with a master of fence—three veneys\r\nfor a dish of stewed prunes—and, by my troth, I cannot abide the smell\r\nof hot meat since. Why do your dogs bark so? Be there bears i’ the\r\ntown?\r\n\r\nANNE.\r\nI think there are, sir; I heard them talked of.\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nI love the sport well, but I shall as soon quarrel at it as any man in\r\nEngland. You are afraid, if you see the bear loose, are you not?\r\n\r\nANNE.\r\nAy, indeed, sir.\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nThat’s meat and drink to me now. I have seen Sackerson loose twenty\r\ntimes, and have taken him by the chain. But, I warrant you, the women\r\nhave so cried and shrieked at it that it passed. But women, indeed,\r\ncannot abide ’em; they are very ill-favoured rough things.\r\n\r\nEnter Page.\r\n\r\nPAGE\r\nCome, gentle Master Slender, come. We stay for you.\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nI’ll eat nothing, I thank you, sir.\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nBy cock and pie, you shall not choose, sir! Come, come.\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nNay, pray you lead the way.\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nCome on, sir.\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nMistress Anne, yourself shall go first.\r\n\r\nANNE.\r\nNot I, sir; pray you keep on.\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nTruly, I will not go first; truly, la! I will not do you that wrong.\r\n\r\nANNE.\r\nI pray you, sir.\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nI’ll rather be unmannerly than troublesome. You do yourself wrong,\r\nindeed, la!\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II.

And\r\nthere dwells one Mistress Quickly, which is in the manner of his nurse,\r\nor his dry nurse, or his cook, or his laundry, his washer and his\r\nwringer.\r\n\r\nSIMPLE.\r\nWell, sir.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nNay, it is petter yet. Give her this letter. For it is a ’oman that\r\naltogether’s acquaintance with Mistress Anne Page; and the letter is to\r\ndesire and require her to solicit your master’s desires to Mistress\r\nAnne Page. I pray you be gone. I will make an end of my dinner; there’s\r\npippins and cheese to come.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III.

Speak scholarly and wisely.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nTruly, mine host, I must turn away some of my followers.\r\n\r\nHOST.\r\nDiscard, bully Hercules; cashier. Let them wag; trot, trot.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nI sit at ten pounds a week.\r\n\r\nHOST.\r\nThou’rt an emperor—Caesar, Keiser, and Pheazar. I will entertain\r\nBardolph. He shall draw, he shall tap. Said I well, bully Hector?\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nDo so, good mine host.\r\n\r\nHOST.\r\nI have spoke, let him follow.—Let me see thee froth and lime. I am at a\r\nword, follow.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Host._]\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nBardolph, follow him. A tapster is a good trade. An old cloak makes a\r\nnew jerkin; a withered servingman a fresh tapster. Go, adieu.\r\n\r\nBARDOLPH.\r\nIt is a life that I have desired. I will thrive.\r\n\r\nPISTOL.\r\nO base Hungarian wight, wilt thou the spigot wield?\r\n\r\n[_Exit Bardolph._]\r\n\r\nNYM\r\nHe was gotten in drink. Is not the humour conceited?\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nI am glad I am so acquit of this tinderbox. His thefts were too open.\r\nHis filching was like an unskilful singer, he kept not time.\r\n\r\nNYM.\r\nThe good humour is to steal at a minute’s rest.\r\n\r\nPISTOL.\r\n“Convey,” the wise it call. “Steal?” Foh! A _fico_ for the phrase!\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nWell, sirs, I am almost out at heels.\r\n\r\nPISTOL.\r\nWhy, then, let kibes ensue.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nThere is no remedy, I must cony-catch, I must shift.\r\n\r\nPISTOL.\r\nYoung ravens must have food.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nWhich of you know Ford of this town?\r\n\r\nPISTOL.\r\nI ken the wight, he is of substance good.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nMy honest lads, I will tell you what I am about.\r\n\r\nPISTOL.\r\nTwo yards, and more.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nNo quips now, Pistol. Indeed, I am in the waist two yards about, but I\r\nam now about no waste; I am about thrift. Briefly, I do mean to make\r\nlove to Ford’s wife. I spy entertainment in her. She discourses, she\r\ncarves, she gives the leer of invitation. I can construe the action of\r\nher familiar style; and the hardest voice of her behaviour, to be\r\nEnglished rightly, is “I am Sir John Falstaff’s.”\r\n\r\nPISTOL.\r\nHe hath studied her will and translated her will—out of honesty into\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nNYM.\r\nThe anchor is deep. Will that humour pass?\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nNow, the report goes she has all the rule of her husband’s purse.

Humour me the angels.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nI have writ me here a letter to her; and here another to Page’s wife,\r\nwho even now gave me good eyes too, examined my parts with most\r\njudicious oeillades. Sometimes the beam of her view gilded my foot,\r\nsometimes my portly belly.\r\n\r\nPISTOL.\r\nThen did the sun on dunghill shine.\r\n\r\nNYM.\r\nI thank thee for that humour.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nO, she did so course o’er my exteriors with such a greedy intention\r\nthat the appetite of her eye did seem to scorch me up like a\r\nburning-glass. Here’s another letter to her. She bears the purse too;\r\nshe is a region in Guiana, all gold and bounty. I will be cheaters to\r\nthem both, and they shall be exchequers to me; they shall be my East\r\nand West Indies, and I will trade to them both. Go, bear thou this\r\nletter to Mistress Page;—and thou this to Mistress Ford. We will\r\nthrive, lads, we will thrive.\r\n\r\nPISTOL.\r\nShall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become,\r\nAnd by my side wear steel? Then Lucifer take all!\r\n\r\nNYM.\r\nI will run no base humour. Here, take the humour-letter. I will keep\r\nthe ’haviour of reputation.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\n[_To Robin_.] Hold, sirrah, bear you these letters tightly;\r\nSail like my pinnace to these golden shores.—\r\nRogues, hence, avaunt! Vanish like hailstones, go!\r\nTrudge, plod away o’ th’ hoof, seek shelter, pack!\r\nFalstaff will learn the humour of this age:\r\nFrench thrift, you rogues—myself and skirted page.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Falstaff and Robin._]\r\n\r\nPISTOL\r\nLet vultures gripe thy guts! For gourd and fullam holds,\r\nAnd high and low beguile the rich and poor.\r\nTester I’ll have in pouch when thou shalt lack,\r\nBase Phrygian Turk!\r\n\r\nNYM.\r\nI have operations in my head which be humours of revenge.\r\n\r\nPISTOL.\r\nWilt thou revenge?\r\n\r\nNYM.\r\nBy welkin and her star!\r\n\r\nPISTOL.\r\nWith wit or steel?\r\n\r\nNYM.\r\nWith both the humours, I.\r\nI will discuss the humour of this love to Ford.\r\n\r\nPISTOL.\r\nAnd I to Page shall eke unfold\r\nHow Falstaff, varlet vile,\r\nHis dove will prove, his gold will hold,\r\nAnd his soft couch defile.\r\n\r\nNYM.\r\nMy humour shall not cool. I will incense Ford to deal with poison, I\r\nwill possess him with yellowness, for the revolt of mine is dangerous.\r\nThat is my true humour.\r\n\r\nPISTOL.\r\nThou art the Mars of malcontents. I second thee. Troop on.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV. A room in Doctor Caius’s house\r\n\r\nEnter Mistress Quickly and Simple.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nWhat, John Rugby!\r\n\r\nEnter Rugby.\r\n\r\nI pray thee go to the casement, and see if you can see my master,\r\nMaster Doctor Caius, coming. If he do, i’ faith, and find anybody in\r\nthe house, here will be an old abusing of God’s patience and the King’s\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nRUGBY.\r\nI’ll go watch.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nGo; and we’ll have a posset for’t soon at night, in faith, at the\r\nlatter end of a sea-coal fire.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Rugby._]\r\n\r\nAn honest, willing, kind fellow, as ever servant shall come in house\r\nwithal; and, I warrant you, no tell-tale nor no breed-bate. His worst\r\nfault is that he is given to prayer; he is something peevish that way,\r\nbut nobody but has his fault. But let that pass. Peter Simple you say\r\nyour name is?\r\n\r\nSIMPLE.\r\nAy, for fault of a better.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nAnd Master Slender’s your master?\r\n\r\nSIMPLE.\r\nAy, forsooth.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nDoes he not wear a great round beard, like a glover’s paring-knife?\r\n\r\nSIMPLE.\r\nNo, forsooth, he hath but a little wee face, with a little yellow\r\nbeard, a Cain-coloured beard.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nA softly-sprighted man, is he not?\r\n\r\nSIMPLE.\r\nAy, forsooth. But he is as tall a man of his hands as any is between\r\nthis and his head. He hath fought with a warrener.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nHow say you? O, I should remember him. Does he not hold up his head, as\r\nit were, and strut in his gait?\r\n\r\nSIMPLE.\r\nYes, indeed, does he.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nWell, heaven send Anne Page no worse fortune! Tell Master Parson Evans\r\nI will do what I can for your master. Anne is a good girl, and I wish—\r\n\r\nEnter Rugby.\r\n\r\nRUGBY\r\nOut, alas! Here comes my master.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nWe shall all be shent. Run in here, good young man, go into this\r\ncloset. He will not stay long.\r\n\r\n[_Simple steps into the closet._]\r\n\r\nWhat, John Rugby! John! What, John, I say! Go, John, go inquire for my\r\nmaster. I doubt he be not well, that he comes not home.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Rugby._]\r\n\r\n[_Sings_.] _And down, down, adown-a, etc._\r\n\r\nEnter Doctor Caius.\r\n\r\nCAIUS\r\nVat is you sing? I do not like dese toys. Pray you, go and vetch me in\r\nmy closet _une boîtine verte_, a box, a green-a box. Do intend vat I\r\nspeak? A green-a box.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nAy, forsooth, I’ll fetch it you.\r\n[_Aside_.] I am glad he went not in himself. If he had found the young\r\nman, he would have been horn-mad.\r\n\r\nCAIUS.\r\n_Fe, fe, fe fe! Ma foi, il fait fort chaud. Je m’en vais à la cour—la\r\ngrande affaire._\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nIs it this, sir?\r\n\r\nCAIUS.\r\n_Oui, mette-le au mon_ pocket. _Dépêche_, quickly—Vere is dat knave\r\nRugby?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nWhat, John Rugby, John!\r\n\r\nEnter Rugby.\r\n\r\nRUGBY\r\nHere, sir.\r\n\r\nCAIUS.\r\nYou are John Rugby, and you are Jack Rugby. Come, take-a your rapier,\r\nand come after my heel to the court.\r\n\r\nRUGBY.\r\n’Tis ready, sir, here in the porch.\r\n\r\nCAIUS.\r\nBy my trot, I tarry too long. ’Od’s me! _Qu’ay j’oublié?_ Dere is some\r\nsimples in my closet dat I vill not for the varld I shall leave behind.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nAy me, he’ll find the young man there, and be mad!\r\n\r\nCAIUS.\r\n_O diable, diable!_ Vat is in my closet? Villainy! _Larron!_ [_Pulling\r\nSimple out_.] Rugby, my rapier!\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nGood master, be content.\r\n\r\nCAIUS.\r\nWherefore shall I be content-a?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nThe young man is an honest man.\r\n\r\nCAIUS.\r\nWhat shall de honest man do in my closet? Dere is no honest man dat\r\nshall come in my closet.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nI beseech you, be not so phlegmatic. Hear the truth of it. He came of\r\nan errand to me from Parson Hugh.\r\n\r\nCAIUS.\r\nVell?\r\n\r\nSIMPLE.\r\nAy, forsooth, to desire her to—\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nPeace, I pray you.\r\n\r\nCAIUS.\r\nPeace-a your tongue!—Speak-a your tale.\r\n\r\nSIMPLE.\r\nTo desire this honest gentlewoman, your maid, to speak a good word to\r\nMistress Anne Page for my master in the way of marriage.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nThis is all, indeed, la! But I’ll ne’er put my finger in the fire, and\r\nneed not.\r\n\r\nCAIUS.\r\nSir Hugh send-a you?—Rugby, _baille_ me some paper.—Tarry you a\r\nlittle-a while.\r\n\r\n[_Writes._]\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\n[_Aside to Simple_.] I am glad he is so quiet. If he had been throughly\r\nmoved, you should have heard him so loud and so melancholy. But\r\nnotwithstanding, man, I’ll do you your master what good I can; and the\r\nvery yea and the no is, the French doctor, my master—I may call him my\r\nmaster, look you, for I keep his house, and I wash, wring, brew, bake,\r\nscour, dress meat and drink, make the beds, and do all myself—\r\n\r\nSIMPLE.\r\n[_Aside to Mistress Quickly_.] ’Tis a great charge to come under one\r\nbody’s hand.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\n[_Aside to Simple_.] Are you avised o’ that? You shall find it a great\r\ncharge, and to be up early and down late; but notwithstanding—to tell\r\nyou in your ear, I would have no words of it—my master himself is in\r\nlove with Mistress Anne Page; but notwithstanding that, I know Anne’s\r\nmind. That’s neither here nor there.\r\n\r\nCAIUS.\r\nYou jack’nape, give-a dis letter to Sir Hugh. By gar, it is a\r\nshallenge. I will cut his troat in de park, and I will teach a scurvy\r\njackanape priest to meddle or make. You may be gone, it is not good you\r\ntarry here.—By gar, I will cut all his two stones. By gar, he shall not\r\nhave a stone to throw at his dog.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Simple._]\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nAlas, he speaks but for his friend.\r\n\r\nCAIUS.\r\nIt is no matter-a ver dat. Do not you tell-a me dat I shall have Anne\r\nPage for myself? By gar, I vill kill de Jack priest; and I have\r\nappointed mine host of de Jarteer to measure our weapon. By gar, I will\r\nmyself have Anne Page.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nSir, the maid loves you, and all shall be well. We must give folks\r\nleave to prate. What, the good-year!\r\n\r\nCAIUS.\r\nRugby, come to the court with me. [_To Mistress Quickly_.] By gar, if I\r\nhave not Anne Page, I shall turn your head out of my door.—Follow my\r\nheels, Rugby.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Caius and Rugby._]\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nYou shall have An—fool’s head of your own. No, I know Anne’s mind for\r\nthat. Never a woman in Windsor knows more of Anne’s mind than I do, nor\r\ncan do more than I do with her, I thank heaven.\r\n\r\nFENTON.\r\n[_Within_.] Who’s within there, ho?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nWho’s there, I trow? Come near the house, I pray you.\r\n\r\nEnter Fenton.\r\n\r\nFENTON\r\nHow now, good woman? How dost thou?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nThe better, that it pleases your good worship to ask.\r\n\r\nFENTON.\r\nWhat news? How does pretty Mistress Anne?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nIn truth, sir, and she is pretty, and honest, and gentle; and one that\r\nis your friend, I can tell you that by the way, I praise heaven for it.\r\n\r\nFENTON.\r\nShall I do any good, think’st thou? Shall I not lose my suit?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nTroth, sir, all is in His hands above. But notwithstanding, Master\r\nFenton, I’ll be sworn on a book she loves you. Have not your worship a\r\nwart above your eye?\r\n\r\nFENTON.\r\nYes, marry, have I; what of that?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nWell, thereby hangs a tale. Good faith, it is such another Nan! But, I\r\ndetest, an honest maid as ever broke bread. We had an hour’s talk of\r\nthat wart. I shall never laugh but in that maid’s company. But, indeed,\r\nshe is given too much to allicholy and musing. But for you—well, go to.\r\n\r\nFENTON.\r\nWell, I shall see her today. Hold, there’s money for thee. Let me have\r\nthy voice in my behalf. If thou seest her before me, commend me.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nWill I? I’ faith, that we will! And I will tell your worship more of\r\nthe wart the next time we have confidence, and of other wooers.\r\n\r\nFENTON.\r\nWell, farewell, I am in great haste now.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nFarewell to your worship.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Fenton._]\r\n\r\nTruly, an honest gentleman—but Anne loves him not, for I know Anne’s\r\nmind as well as another does. Out upon ’t, what have I forgot?\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\nACT II\r\n\r\nSCENE I. Before Page’s house\r\n\nEnter Mistress Page reading a letter.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nWhat, have I scaped love-letters in the holiday-time of my beauty, and\r\nam I now a subject for them? Let me see.\r\n[_Reads_.] _Ask me no reason why I love you, for though Love use Reason\r\nfor his precisian, he admits him not for his counsellor. You are not\r\nyoung, no more am I. Go to, then, there’s sympathy. You are merry, so\r\nam I. Ha, ha, then there’s more sympathy. You love sack, and so do I.\r\nWould you desire better sympathy? Let it suffice thee, Mistress Page,\r\nat the least, if the love of soldier can suffice, that I love thee. I\r\nwill not say, pity me—’tis not a soldier-like phrase—but I say love me.\r\nBy me,\r\n Thine own true knight,\r\n By day or night,\r\n Or any kind of light,\r\n With all his might,\r\n For thee to fight,\r\n John Falstaff._\r\nWhat a Herod of Jewry is this! O wicked, wicked world! One that is\r\nwell-nigh worn to pieces with age, to show himself a young gallant!\r\nWhat an unweighed behaviour hath this Flemish drunkard picked—with the\r\ndevil’s name!—out of my conversation, that he dares in this manner\r\nassay me? Why, he hath not been thrice in my company! What should I say\r\nto him? I was then frugal of my mirth. Heaven forgive me! Why, I’ll\r\nexhibit a bill in the parliament for the putting down of men. How shall\r\nI be revenged on him? For revenged I will be, as sure as his guts are\r\nmade of puddings.\r\n\r\nEnter Mistress Ford.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nMistress Page! Trust me, I was going to your house.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nAnd, trust me, I was coming to you. You look very ill.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nNay, I’ll ne’er believe that. I have to show to the contrary.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nFaith, but you do, in my mind.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nWell, I do, then. Yet I say I could show you to the contrary. O,\r\nMistress Page, give me some counsel.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nWhat’s the matter, woman?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nO woman, if it were not for one trifling respect, I could come to such\r\nhonour!\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nHang the trifle, woman; take the honour. What is it? Dispense with\r\ntrifles. What is it?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nIf I would but go to hell for an eternal moment or so, I could be\r\nknighted.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nWhat? Thou liest! Sir Alice Ford! These knights will hack, and so thou\r\nshouldst not alter the article of thy gentry.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nWe burn daylight. Here, read, read. Perceive how I might be knighted. I\r\nshall think the worse of fat men as long as I have an eye to make\r\ndifference of men’s liking. And yet he would not swear; praised women’s\r\nmodesty; and gave such orderly and well-behaved reproof to all\r\nuncomeliness that I would have sworn his disposition would have gone to\r\nthe truth of his words. But they do no more adhere and keep place\r\ntogether than the Hundredth Psalm to the tune of “Greensleeves.” What\r\ntempest, I trow, threw this whale, with so many tuns of oil in his\r\nbelly, ashore at Windsor? How shall I be revenged on him? I think the\r\nbest way were to entertain him with hope, till the wicked fire of lust\r\nhave melted him in his own grease. Did you ever hear the like?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nLetter for letter, but that the name of Page and Ford differs! To thy\r\ngreat comfort in this mystery of ill opinions, here’s the twin brother\r\nof thy letter. But let thine inherit first, for I protest mine never\r\nshall. I warrant he hath a thousand of these letters, writ with blank\r\nspace for different names—sure, more, and these are of the second\r\nedition. He will print them, out of doubt; for he cares not what he\r\nputs into the press, when he would put us two. I had rather be a\r\ngiantess and lie under Mount Pelion. Well, I will find you twenty\r\nlascivious turtles ere one chaste man.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nWhy, this is the very same—the very hand, the very words. What doth he\r\nthink of us?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nNay, I know not. It makes me almost ready to wrangle with mine own\r\nhonesty. I’ll entertain myself like one that I am not acquainted\r\nwithal; for, sure, unless he know some strain in me that I know not\r\nmyself, he would never have boarded me in this fury.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\n“Boarding” call you it? I’ll be sure to keep him above deck.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nSo will I. If he come under my hatches, I’ll never to sea again. Let’s\r\nbe revenged on him. Let’s appoint him a meeting, give him a show of\r\ncomfort in his suit, and lead him on with a fine-baited delay, till he\r\nhath pawned his horses to mine host of the Garter.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nNay, I will consent to act any villainy against him that may not sully\r\nthe chariness of our honesty. O, that my husband saw this letter! It\r\nwould give eternal food to his jealousy.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nWhy, look where he comes; and my good man too. He’s as far from\r\njealousy as I am from giving him cause, and that, I hope, is an\r\nunmeasurable distance.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nYou are the happier woman.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nLet’s consult together against this greasy knight. Come hither.\r\n\r\n[_They retire._]\r\n\r\nEnter Ford with Pistol, and Page with Nym.\r\n\r\nFORD\r\nWell, I hope it be not so.\r\n\r\nPISTOL.\r\nHope is a curtal dog in some affairs.\r\nSir John affects thy wife.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nWhy, sir, my wife is not young.\r\n\r\nPISTOL.\r\nHe woos both high and low, both rich and poor,\r\nBoth young and old, one with another, Ford.\r\nHe loves the gallimaufry. Ford, perpend.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nLove my wife?\r\n\r\nPISTOL.\r\nWith liver burning hot.\r\nPrevent, or go thou like Sir Actaeon he,\r\nWith Ringwood at thy heels.\r\nO, odious is the name!\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nWhat name, sir?\r\n\r\nPISTOL.\r\nThe horn, I say. Farewell.\r\nTake heed, have open eye, for thieves do foot by night.\r\nTake heed, ere summer comes, or cuckoo birds do sing.—\r\nAway, Sir Corporal Nym.—Believe it, Page, he speaks sense.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Pistol._]\r\n\r\nFORD\r\n[_Aside_.] I will be patient. I will find out this.\r\n\r\nNYM.\r\n[_To Page_.] And this is true, I like not the humour of lying. He hath\r\nwronged me in some humours. I should have borne the humoured letter to\r\nher; but I have a sword, and it shall bite upon my necessity. He loves\r\nyour wife; there’s the short and the long. My name is Corporal Nym. I\r\nspeak, and I avouch ’tis true. My name is Nym, and Falstaff loves your\r\nwife. Adieu. I love not the humour of bread and cheese. Adieu.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Nym._]\r\n\r\nPAGE\r\n[_Aside_.] “The humour of it,” quoth ’a! Here’s a fellow frights\r\nEnglish out of his wits.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\n[_Aside_.] I will seek out Falstaff.\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\n[_Aside_.] I never heard such a drawling, affecting rogue.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\n[_Aside_.] If I do find it—well.\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\n[_Aside_.] I will not believe such a Cataian, though the priest o’ the\r\ntown commended him for a true man.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\n[_Aside_.] ’Twas a good sensible fellow—well.\r\n\r\nMistress Page and Mistress Ford come forward.\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nHow now, Meg?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nWhither go you, George? Hark you.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nHow now, sweet Frank, why art thou melancholy?\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nI melancholy? I am not melancholy. Get you home, go.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nFaith, thou hast some crotchets in thy head now.—Will you go, Mistress\r\nPage?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nHave with you. You’ll come to dinner, George?\r\n[_Aside to Mistress Ford_.] Look who comes yonder. She shall be our\r\nmessenger to this paltry knight.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\n[_Aside to Mistress Page_.] Trust me, I thought on her. She’ll fit it.\r\n\r\nEnter Mistress Quickly.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nYou are come to see my daughter Anne?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nAy, forsooth. And, I pray, how does good Mistress Anne?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nGo in with us and see. We’d have an hour’s talk with you.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Mistress Page, Mistress Ford and Mistress Quickly._]\r\n\r\nPAGE\r\nHow now, Master Ford?\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nYou heard what this knave told me, did you not?\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nYes, and you heard what the other told me?\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nDo you think there is truth in them?\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nHang ’em, slaves! I do not think the knight would offer it, but these\r\nthat accuse him in his intent towards our wives are a yoke of his\r\ndiscarded men, very rogues, now they be out of service.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nWere they his men?\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nMarry, were they.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nI like it never the better for that. Does he lie at the Garter?\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nAy, marry, does he. If he should intend this voyage toward my wife, I\r\nwould turn her loose to him; and what he gets more of her than sharp\r\nwords, let it lie on my head.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nI do not misdoubt my wife, but I would be loath to turn them together.\r\nA man may be too confident. I would have nothing lie on my head. I\r\ncannot be thus satisfied.\r\n\r\nEnter Host.\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nLook where my ranting host of the Garter comes. There is either liquor\r\nin his pate or money in his purse when he looks so merrily.—How now,\r\nmine host?\r\n\r\nHOST.\r\nHow now, bully rook? Thou’rt a gentleman.—Cavaliero Justice, I say!\r\n\r\nEnter Shallow.\r\n\r\nSHALLOW.\r\nI follow, mine host, I follow.—Good even and twenty, good Master Page.\r\nMaster Page, will you go with us? We have sport in hand.\r\n\r\nHOST.\r\nTell him, Cavaliero Justice; tell him, bully rook.\r\n\r\nSHALLOW.\r\nSir, there is a fray to be fought between Sir Hugh the Welsh priest and\r\nCaius the French doctor.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nGood mine host o’ the Garter, a word with you.\r\n\r\nHOST.\r\nWhat say’st thou, my bully rook?\r\n\r\n[_Ford and the Host talk apart._]\r\n\r\nSHALLOW\r\n[_To Page_.] Will you go with us to behold it? My merry host hath had\r\nthe measuring of their weapons, and, I think, hath appointed them\r\ncontrary places; for, believe me, I hear the parson is no jester. Hark,\r\nI will tell you what our sport shall be.\r\n\r\n[_Shallow and Page talk apart. Ford and the Host come forward._]\r\n\r\nHOST\r\nHast thou no suit against my knight, my guest cavaliero?\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nNone, I protest. But I’ll give you a pottle of burnt sack to give me\r\nrecourse to him, and tell him my name is Brook, only for a jest.\r\n\r\nHOST.\r\nMy hand, bully. Thou shalt have egress and regress—said I well?—and thy\r\nname shall be Brook. It is a merry knight. Will you go, myn-heers?\r\n\r\nSHALLOW.\r\nHave with you, mine host.\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nI have heard the Frenchman hath good skill in his rapier.\r\n\r\nSHALLOW.\r\nTut, sir, I could have told you more. In these times you stand on\r\ndistance—your passes, stoccadoes, and I know not what. ’Tis the heart,\r\nMaster Page; ’tis here, ’tis here. I have seen the time, with my long\r\nsword I would have made you four tall fellows skip like rats.\r\n\r\nHOST.\r\nHere, boys, here, here! Shall we wag?\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nHave with you. I had rather hear them scold than fight.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Host, Shallow and Page._]\r\n\r\nFORD\r\nThough Page be a secure fool, and stands so firmly on his wife’s\r\nfrailty, yet I cannot put off my opinion so easily. She was in his\r\ncompany at Page’s house, and what they made there I know not. Well, I\r\nwill look further into ’t, and I have a disguise to sound Falstaff. If\r\nI find her honest, I lose not my labour. If she be otherwise, ’tis\r\nlabour well bestowed.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. A room in the Garter Inn\r\n\r\nEnter Falstaff and Pistol.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nI will not lend thee a penny.\r\n\r\nPISTOL.\r\nWhy then, the world’s mine oyster,\r\nWhich I with sword will open.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nNot a penny. I have been content, sir, you should lay my countenance to\r\npawn; I have grated upon my good friends for three reprieves for you\r\nand your coach-fellow Nym, or else you had looked through the grate\r\nlike a gemini of baboons. I am damned in hell for swearing to gentlemen\r\nmy friends you were good soldiers and tall fellows. And when Mistress\r\nBridget lost the handle of her fan, I took ’t upon mine honour thou\r\nhadst it not.\r\n\r\nPISTOL.\r\nDidst not thou share? Hadst thou not fifteen pence?\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nReason, you rogue, reason. Think’st thou I’ll endanger my soul gratis?\r\nAt a word, hang no more about me, I am no gibbet for you. Go—a short\r\nknife and a throng—to your manor of Pickt-hatch, go. You’ll not bear a\r\nletter for me, you rogue? You stand upon your honour! Why, thou\r\nunconfinable baseness, it is as much as I can do to keep the terms of\r\nmy honour precise. Ay, ay, I myself sometimes, leaving the fear of God\r\non the left hand, and hiding mine honour in my necessity, am fain to\r\nshuffle, to hedge, and to lurch; and yet you, rogue, will ensconce your\r\nrags, your cat-a-mountain looks, your red-lattice phrases, and your\r\nbold beating oaths, under the shelter of your honour! You will not do\r\nit! You!\r\n\r\nPISTOL.\r\nI do relent. What wouldst thou more of man?\r\n\r\nEnter Robin.\r\n\r\nROBIN\r\nSir, here’s a woman would speak with you.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nLet her approach.\r\n\r\nEnter Mistress Quickly.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nGive your worship good morrow.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nGood morrow, goodwife.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nNot so, an’t please your worship.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nGood maid, then.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nI’ll be sworn, as my mother was, the first hour I was born.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nI do believe the swearer. What with me?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nShall I vouchsafe your worship a word or two?\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nTwo thousand, fair woman; and I’ll vouchsafe thee the hearing.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nThere is one Mistress Ford, sir—I pray, come a little nearer this ways.\r\nI myself dwell with Master Doctor Caius.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nWell, on; Mistress Ford, you say—\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nYour worship says very true. I pray your worship come a little nearer\r\nthis ways.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nI warrant thee, nobody hears. Mine own people, mine own people.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nAre they so? God bless them, and make them His servants!\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nWell, Mistress Ford, what of her?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nWhy, sir, she’s a good creature. Lord, Lord, your worship’s a wanton!\r\nWell, heaven forgive you, and all of us, I pray!\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nMistress Ford, come, Mistress Ford.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nMarry, this is the short and the long of it: you have brought her into\r\nsuch a canaries as ’tis wonderful. The best courtier of them all, when\r\nthe court lay at Windsor, could never have brought her to such a\r\ncanary. Yet there has been knights, and lords, and gentlemen, with\r\ntheir coaches, I warrant you, coach after coach, letter after letter,\r\ngift after gift, smelling so sweetly, all musk, and so rushling, I\r\nwarrant you, in silk and gold, and in such alligant terms, and in such\r\nwine and sugar of the best and the fairest, that would have won any\r\nwoman’s heart; and I warrant you, they could never get an eye-wink of\r\nher. I had myself twenty angels given me this morning, but I defy all\r\nangels in any such sort, as they say, but in the way of honesty. And, I\r\nwarrant you, they could never get her so much as sip on a cup with the\r\nproudest of them all. And yet there has been earls—nay, which is more,\r\npensioners—but, I warrant you, all is one with her.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nBut what says she to me? Be brief, my good she-Mercury.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nMarry, she hath received your letter, for the which she thanks you a\r\nthousand times; and she gives you to notify that her husband will be\r\nabsence from his house between ten and eleven.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nTen and eleven?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nAy, forsooth; and then you may come and see the picture, she says, that\r\nyou wot of. Master Ford, her husband, will be from home. Alas, the\r\nsweet woman leads an ill life with him. He’s a very jealousy man; she\r\nleads a very frampold life with him, good heart.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nTen and eleven. Woman, commend me to her; I will not fail her.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nWhy, you say well. But I have another messenger to your worship.\r\nMistress Page hath her hearty commendations to you too; and let me tell\r\nyou in your ear, she’s as fartuous a civil modest wife, and one, I tell\r\nyou, that will not miss you morning nor evening prayer, as any is in\r\nWindsor, whoe’er be the other; and she bade me tell your worship that\r\nher husband is seldom from home, but she hopes there will come a time.\r\nI never knew a woman so dote upon a man. Surely I think you have\r\ncharms, la! Yes, in truth.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nNot I, I assure thee. Setting the attraction of my good parts aside, I\r\nhave no other charms.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nBlessing on your heart for ’t!\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nBut, I pray thee, tell me this: has Ford’s wife and Page’s wife\r\nacquainted each other how they love me?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nThat were a jest indeed! They have not so little grace, I hope. That\r\nwere a trick indeed! But Mistress Page would desire you to send her\r\nyour little page, of all loves. Her husband has a marvellous infection\r\nto the little page; and, truly, Master Page is an honest man. Never a\r\nwife in Windsor leads a better life than she does. Do what she will,\r\nsay what she will, take all, pay all, go to bed when she list, rise\r\nwhen she list, all is as she will, and truly she deserves it, for if\r\nthere be a kind woman in Windsor, she is one. You must send her your\r\npage, no remedy.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nWhy, I will.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nNay, but do so then, and, look you, he may come and go between you\r\nboth; and in any case have a nay-word, that you may know one another’s\r\nmind, and the boy never need to understand anything; for ’tis not good\r\nthat children should know any wickedness. Old folks, you know, have\r\ndiscretion, as they say, and know the world.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nFare thee well, commend me to them both. There’s my purse; I am yet thy\r\ndebtor. Boy, go along with this woman.—This news distracts me.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Mistress Quickly and Robin._]\r\n\r\nPISTOL.\r\nThis punk is one of Cupid’s carriers;\r\nClap on more sails, pursue; up with your fights;\r\nGive fire! She is my prize, or ocean whelm them all!\r\n\r\n[_Exit Pistol._]\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nSayst thou so, old Jack? Go thy ways, I’ll make more of thy old body\r\nthan I have done. Will they yet look after thee? Wilt thou, after the\r\nexpense of so much money, be now a gainer? Good body, I thank thee. Let\r\nthem say ’tis grossly done; so it be fairly done, no matter.\r\n\r\nEnter Bardolph with a cup of sack.\r\n\r\nBARDOLPH\r\nSir John, there’s one Master Brook below would fain speak with you and\r\nbe acquainted with you, and hath sent your worship a morning’s draught\r\nof sack.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nBrook is his name?\r\n\r\nBARDOLPH.\r\nAy, sir.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nCall him in.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Bardolph._]\r\n\r\nSuch Brooks are welcome to me, that o’erflow such liquor. Ah, ha,\r\nMistress Ford and Mistress Page, have I encompassed you? Go to, _via!_\r\n\r\nEnter Bardolph with Ford disguised as Brook.\r\n\r\nFORD\r\nGod bless you, sir.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nAnd you, sir. Would you speak with me?\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nI make bold to press with so little preparation upon you.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nYou’re welcome. What’s your will?—Give us leave, drawer.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Bardolph._]\r\n\r\nFORD\r\nSir, I am a gentleman that have spent much. My name is Brook.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nGood Master Brook, I desire more acquaintance of you.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nGood Sir John, I sue for yours; not to charge you, for I must let you\r\nunderstand I think myself in better plight for a lender than you are,\r\nthe which hath something emboldened me to this unseasoned intrusion;\r\nfor they say, if money go before, all ways do lie open.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nMoney is a good soldier, sir, and will on.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nTroth, and I have a bag of money here troubles me. If you will help to\r\nbear it, Sir John, take all, or half, for easing me of the carriage.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nSir, I know not how I may deserve to be your porter.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nI will tell you, sir, if you will give me the hearing.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nSpeak, good Master Brook. I shall be glad to be your servant.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nSir, I hear you are a scholar—I will be brief with you—and you have\r\nbeen a man long known to me, though I had never so good means as desire\r\nto make myself acquainted with you. I shall discover a thing to you,\r\nwherein I must very much lay open mine own imperfection. But, good Sir\r\nJohn, as you have one eye upon my follies, as you hear them unfolded,\r\nturn another into the register of your own, that I may pass with a\r\nreproof the easier, sith you yourself know how easy it is to be such an\r\noffender.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nVery well, sir, proceed.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nThere is a gentlewoman in this town, her husband’s name is Ford.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nWell, sir.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nI have long loved her, and, I protest to you, bestowed much on her,\r\nfollowed her with a doting observance, engrossed opportunities to meet\r\nher, fee’d every slight occasion that could but niggardly give me sight\r\nof her, not only bought many presents to give her, but have given\r\nlargely to many to know what she would have given. Briefly, I have\r\npursued her as love hath pursued me, which hath been on the wing of all\r\noccasions. But whatsoever I have merited, either in my mind or in my\r\nmeans, meed, I am sure, I have received none, unless experience be a\r\njewel. That I have purchased at an infinite rate, and that hath taught\r\nme to say this:\r\nLove like a shadow flies when substance love pursues,\r\nPursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nHave you received no promise of satisfaction at her hands?\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nNever.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nHave you importuned her to such a purpose?\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nNever.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nOf what quality was your love, then?\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nLike a fair house built on another man’s ground, so that I have lost my\r\nedifice by mistaking the place where I erected it.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nTo what purpose have you unfolded this to me?\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nWhen I have told you that, I have told you all. Some say that though\r\nshe appear honest to me, yet in other places she enlargeth her mirth so\r\nfar that there is shrewd construction made of her. Now, Sir John, here\r\nis the heart of my purpose: you are a gentleman of excellent breeding,\r\nadmirable discourse, of great admittance, authentic in your place and\r\nperson, generally allowed for your many warlike, courtlike, and learned\r\npreparations.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nO, sir!\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nBelieve it, for you know it. There is money. Spend it, spend it; spend\r\nmore; spend all I have; only give me so much of your time in exchange\r\nof it as to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this Ford’s wife.\r\nUse your art of wooing, win her to consent to you. If any man may, you\r\nmay as soon as any.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nWould it apply well to the vehemency of your affection that I should\r\nwin what you would enjoy? Methinks you prescribe to yourself very\r\npreposterously.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nO, understand my drift. She dwells so securely on the excellency of her\r\nhonour that the folly of my soul dares not present itself; she is too\r\nbright to be looked against. Now, could I come to her with any\r\ndetection in my hand, my desires had instance and argument to commend\r\nthemselves. I could drive her then from the ward of her purity, her\r\nreputation, her marriage vow, and a thousand other her defences, which\r\nnow are too too strongly embattled against me. What say you to’t, Sir\r\nJohn?\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nMaster Brook, I will first make bold with your money; next, give me\r\nyour hand; and last, as I am a gentleman, you shall, if you will, enjoy\r\nFord’s wife.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nO good sir!\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nI say you shall.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nWant no money, Sir John; you shall want none.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nWant no Mistress Ford, Master Brook; you shall want none. I shall be\r\nwith her, I may tell you, by her own appointment; even as you came in\r\nto me, her assistant or go-between parted from me. I say I shall be\r\nwith her between ten and eleven, for at that time the jealous rascally\r\nknave her husband will be forth. Come you to me at night. You shall\r\nknow how I speed.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nI am blessed in your acquaintance. Do you know Ford, sir?\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nHang him, poor cuckoldly knave! I know him not. Yet I wrong him to call\r\nhim poor. They say the jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money, for\r\nthe which his wife seems to me well-favoured. I will use her as the key\r\nof the cuckoldly rogue’s coffer, and there’s my harvest-home.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nI would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid him if you saw him.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nHang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue! I will stare him out of his\r\nwits, I will awe him with my cudgel; it shall hang like a meteor o’er\r\nthe cuckold’s horns. Master Brook, thou shalt know I will predominate\r\nover the peasant, and thou shalt lie with his wife. Come to me soon at\r\nnight. Ford’s a knave, and I will aggravate his style. Thou, Master\r\nBrook, shalt know him for knave and cuckold. Come to me soon at night.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Falstaff._]\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nWhat a damned epicurean rascal is this! My heart is ready to crack with\r\nimpatience. Who says this is improvident jealousy? My wife hath sent to\r\nhim, the hour is fixed, the match is made. Would any man have thought\r\nthis? See the hell of having a false woman: my bed shall be abused, my\r\ncoffers ransacked, my reputation gnawn at; and I shall not only receive\r\nthis villanous wrong, but stand under the adoption of abominable terms,\r\nand by him that does me this wrong. Terms, names! Amaimon sounds well;\r\nLucifer, well; Barbason, well; yet they are devils’ additions, the\r\nnames of fiends. But cuckold? Wittol? Cuckold? The devil himself hath\r\nnot such a name. Page is an ass, a secure ass; he will trust his wife,\r\nhe will not be jealous. I will rather trust a Fleming with my butter,\r\nParson Hugh the Welshman with my cheese, an Irishman with my aqua-vitae\r\nbottle, or a thief to walk my ambling gelding, than my wife with\r\nherself. Then she plots, then she ruminates, then she devises; and what\r\nthey think in their hearts they may effect, they will break their\r\nhearts but they will effect. God be praised for my jealousy! Eleven\r\no’clock the hour. I will prevent this, detect my wife, be revenged on\r\nFalstaff, and laugh at Page. I will about it. Better three hours too\r\nsoon than a minute too late. Fie, fie, fie! Cuckold, cuckold, cuckold!\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III.

No, he\r\ngives me the proverbs and the no-verbs. [_To Caius_.] Give me thy hand,\r\nterrestrial; so. [_To Evans_.] Give me thy hand, celestial; so. Boys of\r\nart, I have deceived you both. I have directed you to wrong places.\r\nYour hearts are mighty, your skins are whole, and let burnt sack be the\r\nissue. Come, lay their swords to pawn.

A street in Windsor\r\n\r\nEnter Mistress Page following Robin.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nNay, keep your way, little gallant. You were wont to be a follower, but\r\nnow you are a leader. Whether had you rather, lead mine eyes, or eye\r\nyour master’s heels?\r\n\r\nROBIN.\r\nI had rather, forsooth, go before you like a man than follow him like a\r\ndwarf.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nO, you are a flattering boy! Now I see you’ll be a courtier.\r\n\r\nEnter Ford.\r\n\r\nFORD\r\nWell met, Mistress Page. Whither go you?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nTruly, sir, to see your wife. Is she at home?\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nAy, and as idle as she may hang together, for want of company. I think\r\nif your husbands were dead you two would marry.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nBe sure of that—two other husbands.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nWhere had you this pretty weathercock?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nI cannot tell what the dickens his name is my husband had him of.

Hath he any eyes? Hath he any thinking? Sure, they\r\nsleep; he hath no use of them. Why, this boy will carry a letter twenty\r\nmile as easy as a cannon will shoot point-blank twelve score. He pieces\r\nout his wife’s inclination, he gives her folly motion and advantage.\r\nAnd now she’s going to my wife, and Falstaff’s boy with her. A man may\r\nhear this shower sing in the wind. And Falstaff’s boy with her! Good\r\nplots they are laid, and our revolted wives share damnation together.\r\nWell, I will take him, then torture my wife, pluck the borrowed veil of\r\nmodesty from the so-seeming Mistress Page, divulge Page himself for a\r\nsecure and wilful Actaeon, and to these violent proceedings all my\r\nneighbours shall cry aim. [_Clock strikes_.] The clock gives me my cue,\r\nand my assurance bids me search. There I shall find Falstaff. I shall\r\nbe rather praised for this than mocked, for it is as positive as the\r\nearth is firm that Falstaff is there. I will go.\r\n\r\nEnter Page, Shallow, Slender, Host, Sir Hugh Evans, Caius and Rugby.\r\n\r\nSHALLOW, PAGE, etc.\r\nWell met, Master Ford.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nTrust me, a good knot. I have good cheer at home, and I pray you all go\r\nwith me.\r\n\r\nSHALLOW.\r\nI must excuse myself, Master Ford.\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nAnd so must I, sir; we have appointed to dine with Mistress Anne, and I\r\nwould not break with her for more money than I’ll speak of.\r\n\r\nSHALLOW.\r\nWe have lingered about a match between Anne Page and my cousin Slender,\r\nand this day we shall have our answer.\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nI hope I have your good will, father Page.\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nYou have, Master Slender, I stand wholly for you.—But my wife, Master\r\ndoctor, is for you altogether.\r\n\r\nCAIUS.\r\nAy, be-gar; and de maid is love-a me! My nursh-a Quickly tell me so\r\nmush.\r\n\r\nHOST.\r\nWhat say you to young Master Fenton? He capers, he dances, he has eyes\r\nof youth, he writes verses, he speaks holiday, he smells April and May.\r\nHe will carry ’t, he will carry ’t. ’Tis in his buttons he will carry\r\n’t.\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nNot by my consent, I promise you. The gentleman is of no having. He\r\nkept company with the wild Prince and Poins. He is of too high a\r\nregion, he knows too much. No, he shall not knit a knot in his fortunes\r\nwith the finger of my substance. If he take her, let him take her\r\nsimply. The wealth I have waits on my consent, and my consent goes not\r\nthat way.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nI beseech you, heartily, some of you go home with me to dinner. Besides\r\nyour cheer, you shall have sport: I will show you a monster. Master\r\nDoctor, you shall go; so shall you, Master Page, and you, Sir Hugh.\r\n\r\nSHALLOW.\r\nWell, fare you well.

Is the buck-basket—\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nI warrant.—What, Robin, I say!\r\n\r\nEnter John and Robert with a great buck-basket.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nCome, come, come.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nHere, set it down.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nGive your men the charge; we must be brief.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nMarry, as I told you before, John and Robert, be ready here hard by in\r\nthe brew-house; and when I suddenly call you, come forth, and, without\r\nany pause or staggering, take this basket on your shoulders. That done,\r\ntrudge with it in all haste, and carry it among the whitsters in\r\nDatchet Mead, and there empty it in the muddy ditch close by the Thames\r\nside.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nYou will do it?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nI ha’ told them over and over, they lack no direction.—Be gone, and\r\ncome when you are called.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt John and Robert._]\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nHere comes little Robin.\r\n\r\nEnter Robin.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nHow now, my eyas-musket, what news with you?\r\n\r\nROBIN.\r\nMy Master, Sir John, is come in at your back door, Mistress Ford, and\r\nrequests your company.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nYou little Jack-a-Lent, have you been true to us?\r\n\r\nROBIN.\r\nAy, I’ll be sworn. My master knows not of your being here, and hath\r\nthreatened to put me into everlasting liberty if I tell you of it; for\r\nhe swears he’ll turn me away.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nThou’rt a good boy, this secrecy of thine shall be a tailor to thee,\r\nand shall make thee a new doublet and hose. I’ll go hide me.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nDo so.—Go tell thy master I am alone.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Robin._]\r\n\r\nMistress Page, remember you your cue.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nI warrant thee. If I do not act it, hiss me.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Mistress Page._]\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nGo to, then. We’ll use this unwholesome humidity, this gross watery\r\npumpion; we’ll teach him to know turtles from jays.\r\n\r\nEnter Falstaff.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\n“Have I caught thee, my heavenly jewel?” Why, now let me die, for I\r\nhave lived long enough. This is the period of my ambition. O this\r\nblessed hour!\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nO, sweet Sir John!\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nMistress Ford, I cannot cog, I cannot prate, Mistress Ford. Now shall I\r\nsin in my wish: I would thy husband were dead. I’ll speak it before the\r\nbest lord: I would make thee my lady.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nI your lady, Sir John? Alas, I should be a pitiful lady.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nLet the court of France show me such another. I see how thine eye would\r\nemulate the diamond. Thou hast the right arched beauty of the brow that\r\nbecomes the ship-tire, the tire-valiant, or any tire of Venetian\r\nadmittance.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nA plain kerchief, Sir John. My brows become nothing else, nor that well\r\nneither.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nBy the Lord, thou art a traitor to say so. Thou wouldst make an\r\nabsolute courtier, and the firm fixture of thy foot would give an\r\nexcellent motion to thy gait in a semi-circled farthingale. I see what\r\nthou wert, if Fortune thy foe were not, Nature thy friend. Come, thou\r\ncanst not hide it.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nBelieve me, there’s no such thing in me.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nWhat made me love thee? Let that persuade thee there’s something\r\nextraordinary in thee. Come, I cannot cog and say thou art this and\r\nthat, like a many of these lisping hawthorn buds that come like women\r\nin men’s apparel, and smell like Bucklersbury in simple-time. I cannot.\r\nBut I love thee, none but thee; and thou deservest it.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nDo not betray me, sir; I fear you love Mistress Page.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nThou mightst as well say I love to walk by the Counter gate, which is\r\nas hateful to me as the reek of a lime-kiln.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nWell, heaven knows how I love you, and you shall one day find it.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nKeep in that mind, I’ll deserve it.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nNay, I must tell you, so you do; or else I could not be in that mind.\r\n\r\nEnter Robin.\r\n\r\nROBIN.\r\nMistress Ford, Mistress Ford, here’s Mistress Page at the door,\r\nsweating and blowing and looking wildly, and would needs speak with you\r\npresently.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nShe shall not see me; I will ensconce me behind the arras.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nPray you, do so; she’s a very tattling woman.\r\n\r\n[_Falstaff hides himself behind the arras._]\r\n\r\nEnter Mistress Page.\r\n\r\nWhat’s the matter? How now?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nO Mistress Ford, what have you done? You’re shamed, you’re overthrown,\r\nyou’re undone for ever!\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nWhat’s the matter, good Mistress Page?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nO well-a-day, Mistress Ford, having an honest man to your husband, to\r\ngive him such cause of suspicion!\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nWhat cause of suspicion?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nWhat cause of suspicion? Out upon you! How am I mistook in you!\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nWhy, alas, what’s the matter?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nYour husband’s coming hither, woman, with all the officers in Windsor,\r\nto search for a gentleman that he says is here now in the house, by\r\nyour consent, to take an ill advantage of his absence. You are undone.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\n’Tis not so, I hope.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nPray heaven it be not so, that you have such a man here! But ’tis most\r\ncertain your husband’s coming, with half Windsor at his heels, to\r\nsearch for such a one. I come before to tell you. If you know yourself\r\nclear, why, I am glad of it; but if you have a friend here, convey,\r\nconvey him out. Be not amazed, call all your senses to you; defend your\r\nreputation, or bid farewell to your good life for ever.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nWhat shall I do? There is a gentleman, my dear friend; and I fear not\r\nmine own shame as much as his peril. I had rather than a thousand pound\r\nhe were out of the house.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nFor shame! Never stand “you had rather” and “you had rather”. Your\r\nhusband’s here at hand. Bethink you of some conveyance. In the house\r\nyou cannot hide him. O, how have you deceived me! Look, here is a\r\nbasket. If he be of any reasonable stature, he may creep in here; and\r\nthrow foul linen upon him, as if it were going to bucking. Or—it is\r\nwhiting-time—send him by your two men to Datchet Mead.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nHe’s too big to go in there. What shall I do?\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\n[_Comes out of hiding_.] Let me see ’t, let me see ’t! O, let me see\r\n’t! I’ll in, I’ll in. Follow your friend’s counsel. I’ll in.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nWhat, Sir John Falstaff? Are these your letters, knight?\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nI love thee, and none but thee. Help me away. Let me creep in here.\r\nI’ll never—\r\n\r\n[_He goes into the basket; they cover him with dirty clothes._]\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nHelp to cover your master, boy.—Call your men, Mistress Ford.—You\r\ndissembling knight!\r\n\r\n[_Exit Robin._]\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nWhat, John! Robert! John!\r\n\r\nEnter John and Robert.\r\n\r\nGo, take up these clothes here, quickly. Where’s the cowl-staff? Look\r\nhow you drumble! Carry them to the laundress in Datchet Mead; quickly,\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nEnter Ford, Page, Caius and Sir Hugh Evans.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nPray you come near. If I suspect without cause, why then make sport at\r\nme, then let me be your jest; I deserve it.—How now? Whither bear you\r\nthis?\r\n\r\nJOHN and ROBERT.\r\nTo the laundress, forsooth.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nWhy, what have you to do whither they bear it? You were best meddle\r\nwith buck-washing!\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nBuck? I would I could wash myself of the buck! Buck, buck, buck! Ay,\r\nbuck! I warrant you, buck, and of the season too, it shall appear.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt John and Robert with the basket._]\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I have dreamed tonight; I’ll tell you my dream. Here, here,\r\nhere be my keys. Ascend my chambers, search, seek, find out. I’ll\r\nwarrant we’ll unkennel the fox. Let me stop this way first. [_Locks the\r\ndoor_.] So, now uncape.\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nGood Master Ford, be contented: you wrong yourself too much.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nTrue, Master Page.—Up, gentlemen, you shall see sport anon. Follow me,\r\ngentlemen.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Ford._]\r\n\r\nEVANS\r\nThis is fery fantastical humours and jealousies.\r\n\r\nCAIUS.\r\nBy gar, ’tis no the fashion of France; it is not jealous in France.\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nNay, follow him, gentlemen; see the issue of his search.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Page, Evans and Caius._]\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nIs there not a double excellency in this?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nI know not which pleases me better, that my husband is deceived, or Sir\r\nJohn.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nWhat a taking was he in when your husband asked who was in the basket!\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nI am half afraid he will have need of washing, so throwing him into the\r\nwater will do him a benefit.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nHang him, dishonest rascal! I would all of the same strain were in the\r\nsame distress.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nI think my husband hath some special suspicion of Falstaff’s being\r\nhere, for I never saw him so gross in his jealousy till now.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nI will lay a plot to try that, and we will yet have more tricks with\r\nFalstaff. His dissolute disease will scarce obey this medicine.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nShall we send that foolish carrion Mistress Quickly to him, and excuse\r\nhis throwing into the water, and give him another hope, to betray him\r\nto another punishment?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nWe will do it. Let him be sent for tomorrow eight o’clock to have\r\namends.\r\n\r\nEnter Ford, Page, Caius and Sir Hugh Evans.\r\n\r\nFORD\r\nI cannot find him. Maybe the knave bragged of that he could not\r\ncompass.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\n[_Aside to Mistress Ford_.] Heard you that?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nYou use me well, Master Ford, do you?\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nAy, I do so.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nHeaven make you better than your thoughts!\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nAmen!\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nYou do yourself mighty wrong, Master Ford.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nAy, ay; I must bear it.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nIf there be anypody in the house, and in the chambers, and in the\r\ncoffers, and in the presses, heaven forgive my sins at the day of\r\njudgment!\r\n\r\nCAIUS.\r\nBe gar, nor I too; there is nobodies.\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nFie, fie, Master Ford, are you not ashamed? What spirit, what devil\r\nsuggests this imagination? I would not ha’ your distemper in this kind\r\nfor the wealth of Windsor Castle.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\n’Tis my fault, Master Page. I suffer for it.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nYou suffer for a pad conscience. Your wife is as honest a ’omans as I\r\nwill desires among five thousand, and five hundred too.\r\n\r\nCAIUS.\r\nBy gar, I see ’tis an honest woman.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nWell, I promised you a dinner.

O boy, thou hadst a father!\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nI had a father, Mistress Anne; my uncle can tell you good jests of\r\nhim.—Pray you, uncle, tell Mistress Anne the jest how my father stole\r\ntwo geese out of a pen, good uncle.\r\n\r\nSHALLOW.\r\nMistress Anne, my cousin loves you.\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nAy, that I do, as well as I love any woman in Gloucestershire.\r\n\r\nSHALLOW.\r\nHe will maintain you like a gentlewoman.\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nAy, that I will, come cut and long-tail, under the degree of a squire.\r\n\r\nSHALLOW.\r\nHe will make you a hundred and fifty pounds jointure.\r\n\r\nANNE.\r\nGood Master Shallow, let him woo for himself.\r\n\r\nSHALLOW.\r\nMarry, I thank you for it, I thank you for that good comfort.—She calls\r\nyou, coz; I’ll leave you.\r\n\r\nANNE.\r\nNow, Master Slender.\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nNow, good Mistress Anne.\r\n\r\nANNE.\r\nWhat is your will?\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nMy will? ’Od’s heartlings, that’s a pretty jest indeed! I ne’er made my\r\nwill yet, I thank heaven. I am not such a sickly creature, I give\r\nheaven praise.\r\n\r\nANNE.\r\nI mean, Master Slender, what would you with me?\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nTruly, for mine own part I would little or nothing with you. Your\r\nfather and my uncle hath made motions. If it be my luck, so; if not,\r\nhappy man be his dole. They can tell you how things go better than I\r\ncan. You may ask your father. Here he comes.\r\n\r\nEnter Page and Mistress Page.\r\n\r\nPAGE\r\nNow, Master Slender.—Love him, daughter Anne.—\r\nWhy, how now? What does Master Fenton here?\r\nYou wrong me, sir, thus still to haunt my house.\r\nI told you, sir, my daughter is disposed of.\r\n\r\nFENTON.\r\nNay, Master Page, be not impatient.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nGood Master Fenton, come not to my child.\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nShe is no match for you.\r\n\r\nFENTON.\r\nSir, will you hear me?\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nNo, good Master Fenton.—\r\nCome, Master Shallow; come, son Slender, in.—\r\nKnowing my mind, you wrong me, Master Fenton.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Page, Shallow and Slender._]\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nSpeak to Mistress Page.\r\n\r\nFENTON.\r\nGood Mistress Page, for that I love your daughter\r\nIn such a righteous fashion as I do,\r\nPerforce, against all checks, rebukes, and manners,\r\nI must advance the colours of my love\r\nAnd not retire. Let me have your good will.\r\n\r\nANNE.\r\nGood mother, do not marry me to yond fool.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nI mean it not; I seek you a better husband.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nThat’s my master, Master Doctor.\r\n\r\nANNE.\r\nAlas, I had rather be set quick i’ th’ earth,\r\nAnd bowled to death with turnips.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nCome, trouble not yourself, good Master Fenton,\r\nI will not be your friend, nor enemy.\r\nMy daughter will I question how she loves you,\r\nAnd as I find her, so am I affected.\r\nTill then, farewell, sir. She must needs go in;\r\nHer father will be angry.\r\n\r\nFENTON.\r\nFarewell, gentle mistress. Farewell, Nan.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Mistress Page and Anne._]\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nThis is my doing now. “Nay,” said I, “will you cast away your child on\r\na fool, and a physician? Look on Master Fenton.” This is my doing.\r\n\r\nFENTON.\r\nI thank thee; and I pray thee, once tonight\r\nGive my sweet Nan this ring. There’s for thy pains.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nNow Heaven send thee good fortune!\r\n\r\n[_Exit Fenton._]\r\n\r\nA kind heart he hath. A woman would run through fire and water for such\r\na kind heart. But yet I would my master had Mistress Anne, or I would\r\nMaster Slender had her; or, in sooth, I would Master Fenton had her. I\r\nwill do what I can for them all three, for so I have promised and I’ll\r\nbe as good as my word—but speciously for Master Fenton. Well, I must of\r\nanother errand to Sir John Falstaff from my two mistresses. What a\r\nbeast am I to slack it!\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE V.

Well, if I be served such\r\nanother trick, I’ll have my brains ta’en out and buttered, and give\r\nthem to a dog for a New Year’s gift. ’Sblood, the rogues slighted me\r\ninto the river with as little remorse as they would have drowned a\r\nblind bitch’s puppies, fifteen i’ the litter; and you may know by my\r\nsize that I have a kind of alacrity in sinking; if the bottom were as\r\ndeep as hell, I should down. I had been drowned, but that the shore was\r\nshelvy and shallow—a death that I abhor, for the water swells a man,\r\nand what a thing should I have been when I had been swelled! I should\r\nhave been a mountain of mummy.\r\n\r\nEnter Bardolph with sack.\r\n\r\nBARDOLPH\r\nHere’s Mistress Quickly, sir, to speak with you.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nCome, let me pour in some sack to the Thames water, for my belly’s as\r\ncold as if I had swallowed snowballs for pills to cool the reins. Call\r\nher in.\r\n\r\nBARDOLPH.\r\nCome in, woman.\r\n\r\nEnter Mistress Quickly.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nBy your leave, I cry you mercy. Give your worship good morrow.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nTake away these chalices. Go, brew me a pottle of sack finely.\r\n\r\nBARDOLPH.\r\nWith eggs, sir?\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nSimple of itself. I’ll no pullet sperm in my brewage.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Bardolph._]\r\n\r\nHow now?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nMarry, sir, I come to your worship from Mistress Ford.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nMistress Ford? I have had ford enough. I was thrown into the ford, I\r\nhave my belly full of ford.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nAlas the day, good heart, that was not her fault. She does so take on\r\nwith her men; they mistook their erection.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nSo did I mine, to build upon a foolish woman’s promise.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nWell, she laments, sir, for it, that it would yearn your heart to see\r\nit. Her husband goes this morning a-birding; she desires you once more\r\nto come to her, between eight and nine. I must carry her word quickly.\r\nShe’ll make you amends, I warrant you.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nWell, I will visit her. Tell her so, and bid her think what a man is.\r\nLet her consider his frailty, and then judge of my merit.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nI will tell her.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nDo so. Between nine and ten, sayst thou?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nEight and nine, sir.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nWell, be gone. I will not miss her.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nPeace be with you, sir.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Mistress Quickly._]\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nI marvel I hear not of Master Brook; he sent me word to stay within. I\r\nlike his money well. O, here he comes.\r\n\r\nEnter Ford disguised.\r\n\r\nFORD\r\nGod bless you, sir.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nNow, Master Brook, you come to know what hath passed between me and\r\nFord’s wife?\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nThat indeed, Sir John, is my business.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nMaster Brook, I will not lie to you. I was at her house the hour she\r\nappointed me.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nAnd how sped you, sir?\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nVery ill-favouredly, Master Brook.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nHow so, sir? Did she change her determination?\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nNo. Master Brook, but the peaking cornuto her husband, Master Brook,\r\ndwelling in a continual ’larum of jealousy, comes me in the instant of\r\nour encounter, after we had embraced, kissed, protested, and, as it\r\nwere, spoke the prologue of our comedy; and at his heels a rabble of\r\nhis companions, thither provoked and instigated by his distemper, and,\r\nforsooth, to search his house for his wife’s love.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nWhat, while you were there?\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nWhile I was there.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nAnd did he search for you, and could not find you?\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nYou shall hear. As good luck would have it, comes in one Mistress Page,\r\ngives intelligence of Ford’s approach; and, in her invention and Ford’s\r\nwife’s distraction, they conveyed me into a buck-basket.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nA buck-basket!\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nBy the Lord, a buck-basket! Rammed me in with foul shirts and smocks,\r\nsocks, foul stockings, greasy napkins, that, Master Brook, there was\r\nthe rankest compound of villainous smell that ever offended nostril.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nAnd how long lay you there?\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nNay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have suffered to bring this\r\nwoman to evil for your good. Being thus crammed in the basket, a couple\r\nof Ford’s knaves, his hinds, were called forth by their mistress to\r\ncarry me in the name of foul clothes to Datchet Lane. They took me on\r\ntheir shoulders, met the jealous knave their master in the door, who\r\nasked them once or twice what they had in their basket. I quaked for\r\nfear lest the lunatic knave would have searched it; but Fate, ordaining\r\nhe should be a cuckold, held his hand. Well, on went he for a search,\r\nand away went I for foul clothes. But mark the sequel, Master Brook. I\r\nsuffered the pangs of three several deaths: first, an intolerable\r\nfright to be detected with a jealous rotten bell-wether; next, to be\r\ncompassed like a good bilbo in the circumference of a peck, hilt to\r\npoint, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in, like a strong\r\ndistillation, with stinking clothes that fretted in their own grease.\r\nThink of that, a man of my kidney, think of that—that am as subject to\r\nheat as butter; a man of continual dissolution and thaw. It was a\r\nmiracle to ’scape suffocation. And in the height of this bath, when I\r\nwas more than half stewed in grease, like a Dutch dish, to be thrown\r\ninto the Thames and cooled, glowing hot, in that surge, like a\r\nhorseshoe! Think of that—hissing hot—think of that, Master Brook.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nIn good sadness, sir, I am sorry that for my sake you have suffered all\r\nthis. My suit, then, is desperate. You’ll undertake her no more?\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nMaster Brook, I will be thrown into Etna, as I have been into Thames,\r\nere I will leave her thus. Her husband is this morning gone a-birding;\r\nI have received from her another embassy of meeting. ’Twixt eight and\r\nnine is the hour, Master Brook.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\n’Tis past eight already, sir.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nIs it? I will then address me to my appointment. Come to me at your\r\nconvenient leisure, and you shall know how I speed; and the conclusion\r\nshall be crowned with your enjoying her. Adieu. You shall have her,\r\nMaster Brook. Master Brook, you shall cuckold Ford.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Falstaff._]\r\n\r\nFORD\r\nHum! Ha! Is this a vision? Is this a dream? Do I sleep? Master Ford,\r\nawake; awake, Master Ford! There’s a hole made in your best coat,\r\nMaster Ford. This ’tis to be married; this ’tis to have linen and\r\nbuck-baskets! Well, I will proclaim myself what I am. I will now take\r\nthe lecher. He is at my house. He cannot scape me. ’Tis impossible he\r\nshould. He cannot creep into a half-penny purse, nor into a pepperbox.\r\nBut, lest the devil that guides him should aid him, I will search\r\nimpossible places. Though what I am I cannot avoid, yet to be what I\r\nwould not shall not make me tame. If I have horns to make one mad, let\r\nthe proverb go with me: I’ll be horn-mad.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\nACT IV\r\n\r\nSCENE I. The street\r\n\nEnter Mistress Page, Mistress Quickly and William.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nIs he at Master Ford’s already, think’st thou?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nSure he is by this; or will be presently. But truly he is very\r\ncourageous mad about his throwing into the water. Mistress Ford desires\r\nyou to come suddenly.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nI’ll be with her by and by. I’ll but bring my young man here to school.\r\nLook where his master comes; ’tis a playing day, I see.\r\n\r\nEnter Sir Hugh Evans.\r\n\r\nHow now, Sir Hugh, no school today?\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nNo, Master Slender is let the boys leave to play.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nBlessing of his heart!\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nSir Hugh, my husband says my son profits nothing in the world at his\r\nbook. I pray you ask him some questions in his accidence.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nCome hither, William. Hold up your head, come.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nCome on, sirrah. Hold up your head. Answer your master, be not afraid.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nWilliam, how many numbers is in nouns?\r\n\r\nWILLIAM.\r\nTwo.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nTruly, I thought there had been one number more, because they say\r\n“’Od’s nouns.”\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nPeace your tattlings! What is “fair,” William?\r\n\r\nWILLIAM.\r\n_Pulcher_.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nPolecats? There are fairer things than polecats, sure.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nYou are a very simplicity ’oman; I pray you, peace.—What is _lapis_,\r\nWilliam?\r\n\r\nWILLIAM.\r\nA stone.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nAnd what is “a stone,” William?\r\n\r\nWILLIAM.\r\nA pebble.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nNo, it is _lapis_. I pray you remember in your prain.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM.\r\n_Lapis_.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nThat is a good William. What is he, William, that does lend articles?\r\n\r\nWILLIAM.\r\nArticles are borrowed of the pronoun, and be thus declined:\r\n_singulariter, nominativo, hic, haec, hoc_.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\n_Nominativo, hig, haeg, hog_, pray you, mark: _genitivo, huius_. Well,\r\nwhat is your accusative case?\r\n\r\nWILLIAM.\r\n_Accusativo, hinc_.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nI pray you, have your remembrance, child. _Accusativo, hung, hang,\r\nhog_.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\n“Hang-hog” is Latin for bacon, I warrant you.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nLeave your prabbles, ’oman.—What is the focative case, William?\r\n\r\nWILLIAM.\r\nO—_vocativo_—O—\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nRemember, William; focative is _caret_.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nAnd that’s a good root.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\n’Oman, forbear.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nPeace.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nWhat is your genitive case plural, William?\r\n\r\nWILLIAM.\r\nGenitive case?\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nAy.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM.\r\nGenitive: _horum, harum, horum_.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nVengeance of Jenny’s case, fie on her! Never name her, child, if she be\r\na whore.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nFor shame, ’oman.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nYou do ill to teach the child such words.—He teaches him to hick and to\r\nhack, which they’ll do fast enough of themselves; and to call “whore\r\n’m”!—Fie upon you!\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\n’Oman, art thou lunatics? Hast thou no understandings for thy cases,\r\nand the numbers of the genders? Thou art as foolish Christian creatures\r\nas I would desires.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\n[_To Quickly_.] Prithee, hold thy peace.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nShow me now, William, some declensions of your pronouns.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM.\r\nForsooth, I have forgot.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nIt is _qui, quae, quod_. If you forget your _quis_, your _quaes_, and\r\nyour _quods_, you must be preeches. Go your ways and play, go.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nHe is a better scholar than I thought he was.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nHe is a good sprag memory. Farewell, Mistress Page.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nAdieu, good Sir Hugh.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Sir Hugh Evans._]\r\n\r\nGet you home, boy. Come, we stay too long.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. A room in Ford’s house\r\n\r\nEnter Falstaff and Mistress Ford.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nMistress Ford, your sorrow hath eaten up my sufferance. I see you are\r\nobsequious in your love, and I profess requital to a hair’s breadth,\r\nnot only, Mistress Ford, in the simple office of love, but in all the\r\naccoutrement, compliment, and ceremony of it. But are you sure of your\r\nhusband now?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nHe’s a-birding, sweet Sir John.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\n[_Within_.] What ho, gossip Ford, what ho!\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nStep into the chamber, Sir John.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Falstaff._]\r\n\r\nEnter Mistress Page.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nHow now, sweetheart, who’s at home besides yourself?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nWhy, none but mine own people.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nIndeed?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nNo, certainly.\r\n[_Aside to her_.] Speak louder.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nTruly, I am so glad you have nobody here.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nWhy, woman, your husband is in his old lunes again. He so takes on\r\nyonder with my husband, so rails against all married mankind, so curses\r\nall Eve’s daughters, of what complexion soever, and so buffets himself\r\non the forehead, crying “Peer out, peer out!” that any madness I ever\r\nyet beheld seemed but tameness, civility, and patience, to this his\r\ndistemper he is in now. I am glad the fat knight is not here.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nWhy, does he talk of him?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nOf none but him, and swears he was carried out, the last time he\r\nsearched for him, in a basket; protests to my husband he is now here;\r\nand hath drawn him and the rest of their company from their sport, to\r\nmake another experiment of his suspicion. But I am glad the knight is\r\nnot here. Now he shall see his own foolery.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nHow near is he, Mistress Page?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nHard by, at street end. He will be here anon.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nI am undone! The knight is here.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nWhy, then, you are utterly shamed, and he’s but a dead man. What a\r\nwoman are you! Away with him, away with him! Better shame than murder.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nWhich way should he go? How should I bestow him? Shall I put him into\r\nthe basket again?\r\n\r\nEnter Falstaff.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nNo, I’ll come no more i’ the basket. May I not go out ere he come?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nAlas, three of Master Ford’s brothers watch the door with pistols, that\r\nnone shall issue out, otherwise you might slip away ere he came. But\r\nwhat make you here?\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nWhat shall I do? I’ll creep up into the chimney.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nThere they always use to discharge their birding-pieces.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nCreep into the kiln-hole.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nWhere is it?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nHe will seek there, on my word. Neither press, coffer, chest, trunk,\r\nwell, vault, but he hath an abstract for the remembrance of such\r\nplaces, and goes to them by his note. There is no hiding you in the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nI’ll go out then.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nIf you go out in your own semblance, you die, Sir John—unless you go\r\nout disguised.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nHow might we disguise him?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nAlas the day, I know not. There is no woman’s gown big enough for him;\r\notherwise he might put on a hat, a muffler, and a kerchief, and so\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nGood hearts, devise something. Any extremity rather than a mischief.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nMy maid’s aunt, the fat woman of Brentford, has a gown above.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nOn my word, it will serve him. She’s as big as he is. And there’s her\r\nthrummed hat, and her muffler too.—Run up, Sir John.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nGo, go, sweet Sir John. Mistress Page and I will look some linen for\r\nyour head.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nQuick, quick! We’ll come dress you straight; put on the gown the while.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Falstaff._]\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nI would my husband would meet him in this shape. He cannot abide the\r\nold woman of Brentford; he swears she’s a witch, forbade her my house,\r\nand hath threatened to beat her.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nHeaven guide him to thy husband’s cudgel and the devil guide his cudgel\r\nafterwards!\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nBut is my husband coming?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nAy, in good sadness is he, and talks of the basket too, howsoever he\r\nhath had intelligence.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nWe’ll try that; for I’ll appoint my men to carry the basket again, to\r\nmeet him at the door with it as they did last time.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nNay, but he’ll be here presently. Let’s go dress him like the witch of\r\nBrentford.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nI’ll first direct my men what they shall do with the basket. Go up,\r\nI’ll bring linen for him straight.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Mistress Ford._]\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nHang him, dishonest varlet! We cannot misuse him enough.\r\nWe’ll leave a proof, by that which we will do,\r\nWives may be merry and yet honest too.\r\nWe do not act that often jest and laugh;\r\n’Tis old but true: “Still swine eats all the draff.”\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nEnter Mistress Ford with John and Robert.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nGo, sirs, take the basket again on your shoulders. Your master is hard\r\nat door; if he bid you set it down, obey him. Quickly, dispatch.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Mistress Ford._]\r\n\r\nJOHN.\r\nCome, come, take it up.\r\n\r\nROBERT.\r\nPray heaven it be not full of knight again.\r\n\r\nJOHN.\r\nI hope not, I had lief as bear so much lead.\r\n\r\nEnter Ford, Page, Shallow, Caius and Sir Hugh Evans.\r\n\r\nFORD\r\nAy, but if it prove true, Master Page, have you any way then to unfool\r\nme again?—Set down the basket, villain! Somebody call my wife. Youth in\r\na basket! O you panderly rascals! There’s a knot, a gin, a pack, a\r\nconspiracy against me. Now shall the devil be shamed.—What, wife, I\r\nsay! Come, come forth! Behold what honest clothes you send forth to\r\nbleaching!\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nWhy, this passes, Master Ford! You are not to go loose any longer; you\r\nmust be pinioned.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nWhy, this is lunatics, this is mad as a mad dog.\r\n\r\nSHALLOW.\r\nIndeed, Master Ford, this is not well, indeed.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nSo say I too, sir.\r\n\r\nEnter Mistress Ford.\r\n\r\nCome hither, Mistress Ford—Mistress Ford, the honest woman, the modest\r\nwife, the virtuous creature, that hath the jealous fool to her husband!\r\nI suspect without cause, mistress, do I?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nHeaven be my witness you do, if you suspect me in any dishonesty.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nWell said, brazen-face, hold it out.—Come forth, sirrah.\r\n\r\n[_Pulls clothes out of the basket._]\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nThis passes.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nAre you not ashamed? Let the clothes alone.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nI shall find you anon.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\n’Tis unreasonable. Will you take up your wife’s clothes? Come, away.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nEmpty the basket, I say.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nWhy, man, why?\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nMaster Page, as I am a man, there was one conveyed out of my house\r\nyesterday in this basket. Why may not he be there again? In my house I\r\nam sure he is. My intelligence is true, my jealousy is\r\nreasonable.—Pluck me out all the linen.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nIf you find a man there, he shall die a flea’s death.\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nHere’s no man.\r\n\r\nSHALLOW.\r\nBy my fidelity, this is not well, Master Ford, this wrongs you.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nMaster Ford, you must pray, and not follow the imaginations of your own\r\nheart. This is jealousies.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nWell, he’s not here I seek for.\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nNo, nor nowhere else but in your brain.\r\n\r\nFORD\r\nHelp to search my house this one time. If I find not what I seek, show\r\nno colour for my extremity, let me for ever be your table-sport. Let\r\nthem say of me “As jealous as Ford, that searched a hollow walnut for\r\nhis wife’s leman.” Satisfy me once more, once more search with me.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt John and Robert with the basket._]\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nWhat, ho, Mistress Page! Come you and the old woman down; my husband\r\nwill come into the chamber.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nOld woman? What old woman’s that?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nWhy, it is my maid’s aunt of Brentford.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nA witch, a quean, an old cozening quean! Have I not forbid her my\r\nhouse? She comes of errands, does she? We are simple men; we do not\r\nknow what’s brought to pass under the profession of fortune-telling.\r\nShe works by charms, by spells, by the figure, and such daubery as this\r\nis, beyond our element. We know nothing.—Come down, you witch, you hag,\r\nyou! Come down, I say!\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nNay, good sweet husband!—Good gentlemen, let him not strike the old\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nEnter Falstaff disguised as an old woman, led by Mistress Page.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nCome, Mother Prat; come, give me your hand.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nI’ll prat her. [_Beats him_.] Out of my door, you witch, you rag, you\r\nbaggage, you polecat, you runnion! Out, out! I’ll conjure you, I’ll\r\nfortune-tell you.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Falstaff._]\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nAre you not ashamed? I think you have killed the poor woman.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nNay, he will do it. ’Tis a goodly credit for you.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nHang her, witch!\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nBy yea and no, I think the ’oman is a witch indeed. I like not when a\r\n’oman has a great peard. I spy a great peard under her muffler.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nWill you follow, gentlemen? I beseech you follow, see but the issue of\r\nmy jealousy. If I cry out thus upon no trail, never trust me when I\r\nopen again.\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nLet’s obey his humour a little further. Come, gentlemen.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Ford, Page, Caius, Evans and Shallow._]\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nTrust me, he beat him most pitifully.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nNay, by th’ mass, that he did not; he beat him most unpitifully,\r\nmethought.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nI’ll have the cudgel hallowed and hung o’er the altar. It hath done\r\nmeritorious service.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nWhat think you? May we, with the warrant of womanhood and the witness\r\nof a good conscience, pursue him with any further revenge?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nThe spirit of wantonness is sure scared out of him. If the devil have\r\nhim not in fee-simple, with fine and recovery, he will never, I think,\r\nin the way of waste, attempt us again.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nShall we tell our husbands how we have served him?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nYes, by all means, if it be but to scrape the figures out of your\r\nhusband’s brains. If they can find in their hearts the poor unvirtuous\r\nfat knight shall be any further afflicted, we two will still be the\r\nministers.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nI’ll warrant they’ll have him publicly shamed, and methinks there would\r\nbe no period to the jest should he not be publicly shamed.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nCome, to the forge with it, then shape it. I would not have things\r\ncool.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III.

The Duke himself\r\nwill be tomorrow at court, and they are going to meet him.\r\n\r\nHOST.\r\nWhat duke should that be comes so secretly? I hear not of him in the\r\ncourt. Let me speak with the gentlemen. They speak English?\r\n\r\nBARDOLPH.\r\nAy, sir. I’ll call them to you.\r\n\r\nHOST.\r\nThey shall have my horses, but I’ll make them pay, I’ll sauce them.\r\nThey have had my house a week at command; I have turned away my other\r\nguests. They must come off, I’ll sauce them. Come.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV.

Henceforth, do what thou wilt.\r\nI rather will suspect the sun with cold\r\nThan thee with wantonness. Now doth thy honour stand,\r\nIn him that was of late an heretic,\r\nAs firm as faith.\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\n’Tis well, ’tis well, no more.\r\nBe not as extreme in submission as in offence.\r\nBut let our plot go forward. Let our wives\r\nYet once again, to make us public sport,\r\nAppoint a meeting with this old fat fellow,\r\nWhere we may take him and disgrace him for it.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nThere is no better way than that they spoke of.\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nHow? To send him word they’ll meet him in the park at midnight? Fie,\r\nfie, he’ll never come.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nYou say he has been thrown in the rivers, and has been grievously\r\npeaten as an old ’oman. Methinks there should be terrors in him, that\r\nhe should not come. Methinks his flesh is punished; he shall have no\r\ndesires.\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nSo think I too.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nDevise but how you’ll use him when he comes,\r\nAnd let us two devise to bring him thither.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nThere is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter,\r\nSometime a keeper here in Windsor Forest,\r\nDoth all the winter time, at still midnight,\r\nWalk round about an oak, with great ragged horns,\r\nAnd there he blasts the tree, and takes the cattle,\r\nAnd makes milch-kine yield blood, and shakes a chain\r\nIn a most hideous and dreadful manner.\r\nYou have heard of such a spirit, and well you know\r\nThe superstitious idle-headed eld\r\nReceived and did deliver to our age,\r\nThis tale of Herne the hunter for a truth.\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nWhy, yet there want not many that do fear\r\nIn deep of night to walk by this Herne’s oak.\r\nBut what of this?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nMarry, this is our device,\r\nThat Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us,\r\nDisguised like Herne, with huge horns on his head.\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nWell, let it not be doubted but he’ll come,\r\nAnd in this shape; when you have brought him thither,\r\nWhat shall be done with him? What is your plot?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nThat likewise have we thought upon, and thus:\r\nNan Page my daughter, and my little son,\r\nAnd three or four more of their growth, we’ll dress\r\nLike urchins, oafs and fairies, green and white,\r\nWith rounds of waxen tapers on their heads\r\nAnd rattles in their hands. Upon a sudden,\r\nAs Falstaff, she, and I are newly met,\r\nLet them from forth a sawpit rush at once\r\nWith some diffused song; upon their sight\r\nWe two in great amazedness will fly.\r\nThen let them all encircle him about,\r\nAnd fairy-like, to pinch the unclean knight,\r\nAnd ask him why, that hour of fairy revel,\r\nIn their so sacred paths he dares to tread\r\nIn shape profane.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nAnd till he tell the truth,\r\nLet the supposed fairies pinch him sound\r\nAnd burn him with their tapers.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nThe truth being known,\r\nWe’ll all present ourselves, dis-horn the spirit,\r\nAnd mock him home to Windsor.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nThe children must\r\nBe practised well to this, or they’ll ne’er do ’t.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nI will teach the children their behaviours, and I will be like a\r\njackanapes also, to burn the knight with my taber.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nThat will be excellent. I’ll go buy them vizards.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nMy Nan shall be the queen of all the fairies,\r\nFinely attired in a robe of white.\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nThat silk will I go buy.\r\n[_Aside_.] And in that time\r\nShall Master Slender steal my Nan away,\r\nAnd marry her at Eton.—Go, send to Falstaff straight.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nNay, I’ll to him again in name of Brook.\r\nHe’ll tell me all his purpose. Sure, he’ll come.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nFear not you that. Go, get us properties\r\nAnd tricking for our fairies.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nLet us about it. It is admirable pleasures and fery honest knaveries.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Page, Ford and Evans._]\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nGo, Mistress Ford.\r\nSend quickly to Sir John to know his mind.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Mistress Ford._]\r\n\r\nI’ll to the Doctor. He hath my good will,\r\nAnd none but he, to marry with Nan Page.\r\nThat Slender, though well landed, is an idiot,\r\nAnd he my husband best of all affects.\r\nThe Doctor is well moneyed, and his friends\r\nPotent at court.

Speak from thy lungs military. Art thou there? It is\r\nthine host, thine Ephesian, calls.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\n[_Above_.] How now, mine host?\r\n\r\nHOST.\r\nHere’s a Bohemian-Tartar tarries the coming down of thy fat woman. Let\r\nher descend, bully, let her descend. My chambers are honourable. Fie!\r\nPrivacy? Fie!\r\n\r\nEnter Falstaff.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nThere was, mine host, an old fat woman even now with me, but she’s\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nSIMPLE.\r\nPray you, sir, was’t not the wise woman of Brentford?\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nAy, marry was it, mussel-shell. What would you with her?\r\n\r\nSIMPLE.\r\nMy master, sir, my Master Slender, sent to her, seeing her go through\r\nthe streets, to know, sir, whether one Nym, sir, that beguiled him of a\r\nchain, had the chain or no.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nI spake with the old woman about it.\r\n\r\nSIMPLE.\r\nAnd what says she, I pray, sir?\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nMarry, she says that the very same man that beguiled Master Slender of\r\nhis chain cozened him of it.\r\n\r\nSIMPLE.\r\nI would I could have spoken with the woman herself.

Quick.\r\n\r\nSIMPLE.\r\nI may not conceal them, sir.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nConceal them, or thou diest.\r\n\r\nSIMPLE.\r\nWhy, sir, they were nothing but about Mistress Anne Page, to know if it\r\nwere my master’s fortune to have her or no.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\n’Tis, ’tis his fortune.\r\n\r\nSIMPLE.\r\nWhat sir?\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nTo have her, or no.

Speak well of them, varletto.\r\n\r\nBARDOLPH.\r\nRun away, with the cozeners. For so soon as I came beyond Eton, they\r\nthrew me off from behind one of them, in a slough of mire, and set\r\nspurs and away, like three German devils, three Doctor Faustuses.\r\n\r\nHOST.\r\nThey are gone but to meet the Duke, villain, do not say they be fled.\r\nGermans are honest men.\r\n\r\nEnter Sir Hugh Evans.\r\n\r\nEVANS\r\nWhere is mine host?\r\n\r\nHOST.\r\nWhat is the matter, sir?\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nHave a care of your entertainments. There is a friend of mine come to\r\ntown tells me there is three cozen-Germans that has cozened all the\r\nhosts of Readings, of Maidenhead, of Colebrook, of horses and money. I\r\ntell you for good will, look you. You are wise, and full of gibes and\r\nvlouting-stocks, and ’tis not convenient you should be cozened.

By my trot, dere is no duke that the\r\ncourt is know to come. I tell you for good will. Adieu.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Doctor Caius._]\r\n\r\nHOST\r\nHue and cry, villain, go!—Assist me, knight, I am undone.—Fly, run, hue\r\nand cry, villain, I am undone!\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Host and Bardolph._]\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nI would all the world might be cozened, for I have been cozened and\r\nbeaten too. If it should come to the ear of the court how I have been\r\ntransformed, and how my transformation hath been washed and cudgelled,\r\nthey would melt me out of my fat drop by drop, and liquor fishermen’s\r\nboots with me. I warrant they would whip me with their fine wits till I\r\nwere as crestfallen as a dried pear. I never prospered since I forswore\r\nmyself at primero. Well, if my wind were but long enough, I would\r\nrepent.\r\n\r\nEnter Mistress Quickly.\r\n\r\nNow, whence come you?\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nFrom the two parties, forsooth.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nThe devil take one party and his dam the other, and so they shall be\r\nboth bestowed. I have suffered more for their sakes, more than the\r\nvillainous inconstancy of man’s disposition is able to bear.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nAnd have not they suffered? Yes, I warrant, speciously one of them.\r\nMistress Ford, good heart, is beaten black and blue, that you cannot\r\nsee a white spot about her.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nWhat tellst thou me of black and blue? I was beaten myself into all the\r\ncolours of the rainbow, and was like to be apprehended for the witch of\r\nBrentford. But that my admirable dexterity of wit, my counterfeiting\r\nthe action of an old woman, delivered me, the knave constable had set\r\nme i’ the stocks, i’ the common stocks, for a witch.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nSir, let me speak with you in your chamber, you shall hear how things\r\ngo, and, I warrant, to your content. Here is a letter will say\r\nsomewhat. Good hearts, what ado here is to bring you together! Sure,\r\none of you does not serve heaven well, that you are so crossed.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nCome up into my chamber.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE VI. Another room in the Garter Inn\r\n\r\nEnter Fenton and Host.\r\n\r\nHOST.\r\nMaster Fenton, talk not to me. My mind is heavy. I will give over all.\r\n\r\nFENTON.\r\nYet hear me speak. Assist me in my purpose,\r\nAnd, as I am a gentleman, I’ll give thee\r\nA hundred pound in gold more than your loss.\r\n\r\nHOST.\r\nI will hear you, Master Fenton, and I will, at the least, keep your\r\ncounsel.\r\n\r\nFENTON.\r\nFrom time to time I have acquainted you\r\nWith the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page,\r\nWho mutually hath answered my affection,\r\nSo far forth as herself might be her chooser,\r\nEven to my wish. I have a letter from her\r\nOf such contents as you will wonder at,\r\nThe mirth whereof so larded with my matter\r\nThat neither singly can be manifested\r\nWithout the show of both, wherein fat Falstaff\r\nHath a great scene; the image of the jest\r\nI’ll show you here at large. Hark, good mine host:\r\nTonight at Herne’s oak, just ’twixt twelve and one,\r\nMust my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen—\r\nThe purpose why is here—in which disguise,\r\nWhile other jests are something rank on foot,\r\nHer father hath commanded her to slip\r\nAway with Slender, and with him at Eton\r\nImmediately to marry. She hath consented. Now, sir,\r\nHer mother, even strong against that match\r\nAnd firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed\r\nThat he shall likewise shuffle her away,\r\nWhile other sports are tasking of their minds,\r\nAnd at the dean’ry, where a priest attends,\r\nStraight marry her. To this her mother’s plot\r\nShe, seemingly obedient, likewise hath\r\nMade promise to the doctor. Now thus it rests:\r\nHer father means she shall be all in white\r\nAnd in that habit, when Slender sees his time\r\nTo take her by the hand and bid her go,\r\nShe shall go with him. Her mother hath intended\r\nThe better to denote her to the doctor,\r\nFor they must all be masked and vizarded—\r\nThat quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed,\r\nWith ribbons pendant flaring ’bout her head;\r\nAnd when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,\r\nTo pinch her by the hand, and on that token\r\nThe maid hath given consent to go with him.\r\n\r\nHOST.\r\nWhich means she to deceive, father or mother?\r\n\r\nFENTON.\r\nBoth, my good host, to go along with me.\r\nAnd here it rests, that you’ll procure the vicar\r\nTo stay for me at church, ’twixt twelve and one,\r\nAnd, in the lawful name of marrying,\r\nTo give our hearts united ceremony.\r\n\r\nHOST.\r\nWell, husband your device; I’ll to the vicar.\r\nBring you the maid, you shall not lack a priest.\r\n\r\nFENTON.\r\nSo shall I evermore be bound to thee;\r\nBesides, I’ll make a present recompense.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\nACT V\r\n\r\nSCENE I. A room in the Garter Inn\r\n\nEnter Falstaff and Mistress Quickly.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nPrithee, no more prattling. Go. I’ll hold. This is the third time; I\r\nhope good luck lies in odd numbers. Away, go! They say there is\r\ndivinity in odd numbers, either in nativity, chance, or death. Away!\r\n\r\nMISTRESS QUICKLY.\r\nI’ll provide you a chain, and I’ll do what I can to get you a pair of\r\nhorns.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nAway, I say; time wears. Hold up your head, and mince.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Mistress Quickly._]\r\n\r\nEnter Ford.\r\n\r\nHow now, Master Brook! Master Brook, the matter will be known tonight\r\nor never. Be you in the park about midnight, at Herne’s oak, and you\r\nshall see wonders.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nWent you not to her yesterday, sir, as you told me you had appointed?\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nI went to her, Master Brook, as you see, like a poor old man, but I\r\ncame from her, Master Brook, like a poor old woman. That same knave\r\nFord, her husband, hath the finest mad devil of jealousy in him, Master\r\nBrook, that ever governed frenzy. I will tell you he beat me\r\ngrievously, in the shape of a woman; for in the shape of man, Master\r\nBrook, I fear not Goliath with a weaver’s beam, because I know also\r\nlife is a shuttle. I am in haste. Go along with me; I’ll tell you all,\r\nMaster Brook. Since I plucked geese, played truant, and whipped top, I\r\nknew not what ’twas to be beaten till lately. Follow me, I’ll tell you\r\nstrange things of this knave Ford, on whom tonight I will be revenged,\r\nand I will deliver his wife into your hand. Follow. Strange things in\r\nhand, Master Brook! Follow.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. Windsor Park\r\n\r\nEnter Page, Shallow and Slender.\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nCome, come. We’ll couch i’ the castle ditch till we see the light of\r\nour fairies. Remember, son Slender, my daughter—\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nAy, forsooth. I have spoke with her, and we have a nay-word how to know\r\none another. I come to her in white and cry “mum”; she cries “budget”;\r\nand by that we know one another.\r\n\r\nSHALLOW.\r\nThat’s good too. But what needs either your “mum” or her “budget”? The\r\nwhite will decipher her well enough. It hath struck ten o’clock.\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nThe night is dark. Light and spirits will become it well. Heaven\r\nprosper our sport! No man means evil but the devil, and we shall know\r\nhim by his horns. Let’s away; follow me.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III.

Remember, Jove, thou wast a bull for thy\r\nEuropa; love set on thy horns. O powerful love, that in some respects,\r\nmakes a beast a man, in some other a man a beast! You were also,\r\nJupiter, a swan for the love of Leda. O omnipotent love, how near the\r\ngod drew to the complexion of a goose! A fault done first in the form\r\nof a beast; O Jove, a beastly fault! And then another fault in the\r\nsemblance of a fowl; think on’t, Jove, a foul fault! When gods have hot\r\nbacks, what shall poor men do? For me, I am here a Windsor stag, and\r\nthe fattest, I think, i’ the forest. Send me a cool rut-time, Jove, or\r\nwho can blame me to piss my tallow? Who comes here? My doe?\r\n\r\nEnter Mistress Ford and Mistress Page.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nSir John? Art thou there, my deer, my male deer?\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nMy doe with the black scut!

And, Master Brook,\r\nhe hath enjoyed nothing of Ford’s but his buck-basket, his cudgel, and\r\ntwenty pounds of money, which must be paid to Master Brook. His horses\r\nare arrested for it, Master Brook.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS FORD.\r\nSir John, we have had ill luck, we could never meet.

Both the proofs are extant.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nAnd these are not fairies? I was three or four times in the thought\r\nthey were not fairies; and yet the guiltiness of my mind, the sudden\r\nsurprise of my powers, drove the grossness of the foppery into a\r\nreceived belief, in despite of the teeth of all rhyme and reason, that\r\nthey were fairies. See now how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent when ’tis\r\nupon ill employment!\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nSir John Falstaff, serve Got, and leave your desires, and fairies will\r\nnot pinse you.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nWell said, fairy Hugh.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nAnd leave you your jealousies too, I pray you.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nI will never mistrust my wife again, till thou art able to woo her in\r\ngood English.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nHave I laid my brain in the sun, and dried it, that it wants matter to\r\nprevent so gross o’erreaching as this? Am I ridden with a Welsh goat\r\ntoo? Shall I have a cox-comb of frieze? ’Tis time I were choked with a\r\npiece of toasted cheese.\r\n\r\nEVANS.\r\nSeese is not good to give putter. Your belly is all putter.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\n“Seese” and “putter”? Have I lived to stand at the taunt of one that\r\nmakes fritters of English?

You have the start of me. I am dejected, I am\r\nnot able to answer the Welsh flannel. Ignorance itself is a plummet\r\no’er me. Use me as you will.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nMarry, sir, we’ll bring you to Windsor to one Master Brook, that you\r\nhave cozened of money, to whom you should have been a pander. Over and\r\nabove that you have suffered, I think to repay that money will be a\r\nbiting affliction.\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nYet be cheerful, knight.

I think so, when I took a boy for a girl.\r\nIf I had been married to him, for all he was in woman’s apparel, I\r\nwould not have had him.\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nWhy, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you how you should know my\r\ndaughter by her garments?\r\n\r\nSLENDER.\r\nI went to her in white and cried “mum”, and she cried “budget”, as Anne\r\nand I had appointed, and yet it was not Anne, but a postmaster’s boy.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nGood George, be not angry. I knew of your purpose, turned my daughter\r\ninto green, and indeed she is now with the doctor at the deanery, and\r\nthere married.\r\n\r\nEnter Doctor Caius.\r\n\r\nCAIUS\r\nVere is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened, I ha’ married _un garçon_,\r\na boy; _un paysan_, by gar, a boy. It is not Anne Page. By gar, I am\r\ncozened.\r\n\r\nMISTRESS PAGE.\r\nWhy, did you take her in green?\r\n\r\nCAIUS.\r\nAy, by gar, and ’tis a boy. By gar, I’ll raise all Windsor.\r\n\r\nFORD\r\nThis is strange.

Hear the truth of it.\r\nYou would have married her most shamefully,\r\nWhere there was no proportion held in love.\r\nThe truth is, she and I, long since contracted,\r\nAre now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.\r\nTh’ offence is holy that she hath committed,\r\nAnd this deceit loses the name of craft,\r\nOf disobedience, or unduteous title,\r\nSince therein she doth evitate and shun\r\nA thousand irreligious cursed hours,\r\nWhich forced marriage would have brought upon her.\r\n\r\nFORD.\r\nStand not amazed, here is no remedy.\r\nIn love, the heavens themselves do guide the state.\r\nMoney buys lands, and wives are sold by fate.\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF.\r\nI am glad, though you have ta’en a special stand to strike at me, that\r\nyour arrow hath glanced.\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nWell, what remedy?

What cheer, my love?\r\nDemetrius and Egeus, go along;\r\nI must employ you in some business\r\nAgainst our nuptial, and confer with you\r\nOf something nearly that concerns yourselves.\r\n\r\nEGEUS.\r\nWith duty and desire we follow you.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt all but Lysander and Hermia._]\r\n\r\nLYSANDER.\r\nHow now, my love?

For aught that I could ever read,\r\nCould ever hear by tale or history,\r\nThe course of true love never did run smooth.\r\nBut either it was different in blood—\r\n\r\nHERMIA.\r\nO cross! Too high to be enthrall’d to low.\r\n\r\nLYSANDER.\r\nOr else misgraffèd in respect of years—\r\n\r\nHERMIA.\r\nO spite! Too old to be engag’d to young.\r\n\r\nLYSANDER.\r\nOr else it stood upon the choice of friends—\r\n\r\nHERMIA.\r\nO hell! to choose love by another’s eyes!\r\n\r\nLYSANDER.\r\nOr, if there were a sympathy in choice,\r\nWar, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,\r\nMaking it momentany as a sound,\r\nSwift as a shadow, short as any dream,\r\nBrief as the lightning in the collied night\r\nThat, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,\r\nAnd, ere a man hath power to say, ‘Behold!’\r\nThe jaws of darkness do devour it up:\r\nSo quick bright things come to confusion.\r\n\r\nHERMIA.\r\nIf then true lovers have ever cross’d,\r\nIt stands as an edict in destiny.\r\nThen let us teach our trial patience,\r\nBecause it is a customary cross,\r\nAs due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,\r\nWishes and tears, poor fancy’s followers.\r\n\r\nLYSANDER.\r\nA good persuasion; therefore, hear me, Hermia.\r\nI have a widow aunt, a dowager\r\nOf great revenue, and she hath no child.\r\nFrom Athens is her house remote seven leagues,\r\nAnd she respects me as her only son.\r\nThere, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee,\r\nAnd to that place the sharp Athenian law\r\nCannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,\r\nSteal forth thy father’s house tomorrow night;\r\nAnd in the wood, a league without the town\r\n(Where I did meet thee once with Helena\r\nTo do observance to a morn of May),\r\nThere will I stay for thee.\r\n\r\nHERMIA.\r\nMy good Lysander!\r\nI swear to thee by Cupid’s strongest bow,\r\nBy his best arrow with the golden head,\r\nBy the simplicity of Venus’ doves,\r\nBy that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,\r\nAnd by that fire which burn’d the Carthage queen\r\nWhen the false Trojan under sail was seen,\r\nBy all the vows that ever men have broke\r\n(In number more than ever women spoke),\r\nIn that same place thou hast appointed me,\r\nTomorrow truly will I meet with thee.\r\n\r\nLYSANDER.\r\nKeep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.\r\n\r\n Enter Helena.\r\n\r\nHERMIA.\r\nGod speed fair Helena! Whither away?\r\n\r\nHELENA.\r\nCall you me fair? That fair again unsay.\r\nDemetrius loves your fair. O happy fair!\r\nYour eyes are lode-stars and your tongue’s sweet air\r\nMore tuneable than lark to shepherd’s ear,\r\nWhen wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.\r\nSickness is catching. O were favour so,\r\nYours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go.\r\nMy ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,\r\nMy tongue should catch your tongue’s sweet melody.\r\nWere the world mine, Demetrius being bated,\r\nThe rest I’d give to be to you translated.\r\nO, teach me how you look, and with what art\r\nYou sway the motion of Demetrius’ heart!\r\n\r\nHERMIA.\r\nI frown upon him, yet he loves me still.\r\n\r\nHELENA.\r\nO that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!\r\n\r\nHERMIA.\r\nI give him curses, yet he gives me love.\r\n\r\nHELENA.\r\nO that my prayers could such affection move!\r\n\r\nHERMIA.\r\nThe more I hate, the more he follows me.\r\n\r\nHELENA.\r\nThe more I love, the more he hateth me.\r\n\r\nHERMIA.\r\nHis folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.\r\n\r\nHELENA.\r\nNone but your beauty; would that fault were mine!\r\n\r\nHERMIA.\r\nTake comfort: he no more shall see my face;\r\nLysander and myself will fly this place.\r\nBefore the time I did Lysander see,\r\nSeem’d Athens as a paradise to me.\r\nO, then, what graces in my love do dwell,\r\nThat he hath turn’d a heaven into hell!\r\n\r\nLYSANDER.\r\nHelen, to you our minds we will unfold:\r\nTomorrow night, when Phoebe doth behold\r\nHer silver visage in the watery glass,\r\nDecking with liquid pearl the bladed grass\r\n(A time that lovers’ flights doth still conceal),\r\nThrough Athens’ gates have we devis’d to steal.\r\n\r\nHERMIA.\r\nAnd in the wood where often you and I\r\nUpon faint primrose beds were wont to lie,\r\nEmptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,\r\nThere my Lysander and myself shall meet,\r\nAnd thence from Athens turn away our eyes,\r\nTo seek new friends and stranger companies.\r\nFarewell, sweet playfellow. Pray thou for us,\r\nAnd good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!\r\nKeep word, Lysander. We must starve our sight\r\nFrom lovers’ food, till morrow deep midnight.\r\n\r\nLYSANDER.\r\nI will, my Hermia.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Hermia._]\r\n\r\nHelena, adieu.\r\nAs you on him, Demetrius dote on you!\r\n\r\n [_Exit Lysander._]\r\n\r\nHELENA.\r\nHow happy some o’er other some can be!\r\nThrough Athens I am thought as fair as she.\r\nBut what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;\r\nHe will not know what all but he do know.\r\nAnd as he errs, doting on Hermia’s eyes,\r\nSo I, admiring of his qualities.\r\nThings base and vile, holding no quantity,\r\nLove can transpose to form and dignity.\r\nLove looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;\r\nAnd therefore is wing’d Cupid painted blind.\r\nNor hath love’s mind of any judgment taste.\r\nWings, and no eyes, figure unheedy haste.\r\nAnd therefore is love said to be a child,\r\nBecause in choice he is so oft beguil’d.\r\nAs waggish boys in game themselves forswear,\r\nSo the boy Love is perjur’d everywhere.\r\nFor, ere Demetrius look’d on Hermia’s eyne,\r\nHe hail’d down oaths that he was only mine;\r\nAnd when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,\r\nSo he dissolv’d, and showers of oaths did melt.\r\nI will go tell him of fair Hermia’s flight.\r\nThen to the wood will he tomorrow night\r\nPursue her; and for this intelligence\r\nIf I have thanks, it is a dear expense.\r\nBut herein mean I to enrich my pain,\r\nTo have his sight thither and back again.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Helena._]\r\n\nSCENE II. The Same. A Room in a Cottage\r\n\r\n Enter Quince, Snug, Bottom, Flute, Snout and Starveling.\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nIs all our company here?\r\n\r\nBOTTOM.\r\nYou were best to call them generally, man by man, according to the\r\nscrip.\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nHere is the scroll of every man’s name, which is thought fit through\r\nall Athens, to play in our interlude before the Duke and Duchess, on\r\nhis wedding-day at night.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM.\r\nFirst, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on; then read the\r\nnames of the actors; and so grow to a point.\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nMarry, our play is _The most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of\r\nPyramus and Thisbe_.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM.\r\nA very good piece of work, I assure you, and a merry. Now, good Peter\r\nQuince, call forth your actors by the scroll. Masters, spread\r\nyourselves.\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nAnswer, as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM.\r\nReady. Name what part I am for, and proceed.\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nYou, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM.\r\nWhat is Pyramus—a lover, or a tyrant?\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nA lover, that kills himself most gallantly for love.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM.\r\nThat will ask some tears in the true performing of it. If I do it, let\r\nthe audience look to their eyes. I will move storms; I will condole in\r\nsome measure. To the rest—yet my chief humour is for a tyrant. I could\r\nplay Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a cat in, to make all split.\r\n\r\n The raging rocks\r\n And shivering shocks\r\n Shall break the locks\r\n Of prison gates,\r\n And Phibbus’ car\r\n Shall shine from far,\r\n And make and mar\r\n The foolish Fates.\r\n\r\nThis was lofty. Now name the rest of the players. This is Ercles’ vein,\r\na tyrant’s vein; a lover is more condoling.\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nFrancis Flute, the bellows-mender.\r\n\r\nFLUTE.\r\nHere, Peter Quince.\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nFlute, you must take Thisbe on you.\r\n\r\nFLUTE.\r\nWhat is Thisbe? A wandering knight?\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nIt is the lady that Pyramus must love.\r\n\r\nFLUTE.\r\nNay, faith, let not me play a woman. I have a beard coming.\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nThat’s all one. You shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as small\r\nas you will.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM.\r\nAnd I may hide my face, let me play Thisbe too. I’ll speak in a\r\nmonstrous little voice; ‘Thisne, Thisne!’—‘Ah, Pyramus, my lover dear!\r\nthy Thisbe dear! and lady dear!’\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nNo, no, you must play Pyramus; and, Flute, you Thisbe.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM.\r\nWell, proceed.\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nRobin Starveling, the tailor.\r\n\r\nSTARVELING.\r\nHere, Peter Quince.\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nRobin Starveling, you must play Thisbe’s mother.\r\nTom Snout, the tinker.\r\n\r\nSNOUT\r\nHere, Peter Quince.\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nYou, Pyramus’ father; myself, Thisbe’s father;\r\nSnug, the joiner, you, the lion’s part. And, I hope here is a play\r\nfitted.\r\n\r\nSNUG\r\nHave you the lion’s part written? Pray you, if it be, give it me, for I\r\nam slow of study.\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nYou may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM.\r\nLet me play the lion too. I will roar that I will do any man’s heart\r\ngood to hear me. I will roar that I will make the Duke say ‘Let him\r\nroar again, let him roar again.’\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nIf you should do it too terribly, you would fright the Duchess and the\r\nladies, that they would shriek; and that were enough to hang us all.\r\n\r\nALL\r\nThat would hang us every mother’s son.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM.\r\nI grant you, friends, if you should fright the ladies out of their\r\nwits, they would have no more discretion but to hang us. But I will\r\naggravate my voice so, that I will roar you as gently as any sucking\r\ndove; I will roar you an ’twere any nightingale.\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nYou can play no part but Pyramus, for Pyramus is a sweet-faced man; a\r\nproper man as one shall see in a summer’s day; a most lovely\r\ngentleman-like man. Therefore you must needs play Pyramus.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM.\r\nWell, I will undertake it. What beard were I best to play it in?\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nWhy, what you will.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM.\r\nI will discharge it in either your straw-colour beard, your\r\norange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain beard, or your\r\nFrench-crown-colour beard, your perfect yellow.\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nSome of your French crowns have no hair at all, and then you will play\r\nbare-faced. But, masters, here are your parts, and I am to entreat you,\r\nrequest you, and desire you, to con them by tomorrow night; and meet me\r\nin the palace wood, a mile without the town, by moonlight; there will\r\nwe rehearse, for if we meet in the city, we shall be dogg’d with\r\ncompany, and our devices known. In the meantime I will draw a bill of\r\nproperties, such as our play wants. I pray you fail me not.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM.\r\nWe will meet, and there we may rehearse most obscenely and\r\ncourageously. Take pains, be perfect; adieu.\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nAt the Duke’s oak we meet.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM.\r\nEnough. Hold, or cut bow-strings.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\nACT II\r\n\r\nSCENE I. A wood near Athens\r\n\n Enter a Fairy at one door, and Puck at another.\r\n\r\nPUCK.\r\nHow now, spirit! Whither wander you?\r\n\r\nFAIRY\r\n Over hill, over dale,\r\n Thorough bush, thorough brier,\r\n Over park, over pale,\r\n Thorough flood, thorough fire,\r\n I do wander everywhere,\r\n Swifter than the moon’s sphere;\r\n And I serve the Fairy Queen,\r\n To dew her orbs upon the green.\r\n The cowslips tall her pensioners be,\r\n In their gold coats spots you see;\r\n Those be rubies, fairy favours,\r\n In those freckles live their savours.\r\nI must go seek some dew-drops here,\r\nAnd hang a pearl in every cowslip’s ear.\r\nFarewell, thou lob of spirits; I’ll be gone.\r\nOur Queen and all her elves come here anon.\r\n\r\nPUCK.\r\nThe King doth keep his revels here tonight;\r\nTake heed the Queen come not within his sight,\r\nFor Oberon is passing fell and wrath,\r\nBecause that she, as her attendant, hath\r\nA lovely boy, stol’n from an Indian king;\r\nShe never had so sweet a changeling.\r\nAnd jealous Oberon would have the child\r\nKnight of his train, to trace the forests wild:\r\nBut she perforce withholds the lovèd boy,\r\nCrowns him with flowers, and makes him all her joy.\r\nAnd now they never meet in grove or green,\r\nBy fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,\r\nBut they do square; that all their elves for fear\r\nCreep into acorn cups, and hide them there.\r\n\r\nFAIRY\r\nEither I mistake your shape and making quite,\r\nOr else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite\r\nCall’d Robin Goodfellow. Are not you he\r\nThat frights the maidens of the villagery,\r\nSkim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern,\r\nAnd bootless make the breathless housewife churn,\r\nAnd sometime make the drink to bear no barm,\r\nMislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?\r\nThose that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet Puck,\r\nYou do their work, and they shall have good luck.\r\nAre not you he?\r\n\r\nPUCK.\r\nThou speak’st aright;\r\nI am that merry wanderer of the night.\r\nI jest to Oberon, and make him smile,\r\nWhen I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,\r\nNeighing in likeness of a filly foal;\r\nAnd sometime lurk I in a gossip’s bowl\r\nIn very likeness of a roasted crab,\r\nAnd, when she drinks, against her lips I bob,\r\nAnd on her withered dewlap pour the ale.\r\nThe wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,\r\nSometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;\r\nThen slip I from her bum, down topples she,\r\nAnd ‘tailor’ cries, and falls into a cough;\r\nAnd then the whole quire hold their hips and loffe\r\nAnd waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and swear\r\nA merrier hour was never wasted there.\r\nBut room, fairy. Here comes Oberon.\r\n\r\nFAIRY\r\nAnd here my mistress. Would that he were gone!\r\n\r\n Enter Oberon at one door, with his Train, and Titania at another, with\r\n hers.\r\n\r\nOBERON.\r\nIll met by moonlight, proud Titania.\r\n\r\nTITANIA.\r\nWhat, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence;\r\nI have forsworn his bed and company.\r\n\r\nOBERON.\r\nTarry, rash wanton; am not I thy lord?\r\n\r\nTITANIA.\r\nThen I must be thy lady; but I know\r\nWhen thou hast stol’n away from fairyland,\r\nAnd in the shape of Corin sat all day\r\nPlaying on pipes of corn, and versing love\r\nTo amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,\r\nCome from the farthest steep of India,\r\nBut that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,\r\nYour buskin’d mistress and your warrior love,\r\nTo Theseus must be wedded; and you come\r\nTo give their bed joy and prosperity?\r\n\r\nOBERON.\r\nHow canst thou thus, for shame, Titania,\r\nGlance at my credit with Hippolyta,\r\nKnowing I know thy love to Theseus?\r\nDidst not thou lead him through the glimmering night\r\nFrom Perigenia, whom he ravished?\r\nAnd make him with fair Aegles break his faith,\r\nWith Ariadne and Antiopa?\r\n\r\nTITANIA.\r\nThese are the forgeries of jealousy:\r\nAnd never, since the middle summer’s spring,\r\nMet we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,\r\nBy pavèd fountain, or by rushy brook,\r\nOr on the beachèd margent of the sea,\r\nTo dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,\r\nBut with thy brawls thou hast disturb’d our sport.\r\nTherefore the winds, piping to us in vain,\r\nAs in revenge, have suck’d up from the sea\r\nContagious fogs; which, falling in the land,\r\nHath every pelting river made so proud\r\nThat they have overborne their continents.\r\nThe ox hath therefore stretch’d his yoke in vain,\r\nThe ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn\r\nHath rotted ere his youth attain’d a beard.\r\nThe fold stands empty in the drownèd field,\r\nAnd crows are fatted with the murrion flock;\r\nThe nine-men’s-morris is fill’d up with mud,\r\nAnd the quaint mazes in the wanton green,\r\nFor lack of tread, are undistinguishable.\r\nThe human mortals want their winter here.\r\nNo night is now with hymn or carol blest.\r\nTherefore the moon, the governess of floods,\r\nPale in her anger, washes all the air,\r\nThat rheumatic diseases do abound.\r\nAnd thorough this distemperature we see\r\nThe seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts\r\nFall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose;\r\nAnd on old Hiems’ thin and icy crown\r\nAn odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds\r\nIs, as in mockery, set. The spring, the summer,\r\nThe childing autumn, angry winter, change\r\nTheir wonted liveries; and the mazed world,\r\nBy their increase, now knows not which is which.\r\nAnd this same progeny of evils comes\r\nFrom our debate, from our dissension;\r\nWe are their parents and original.\r\n\r\nOBERON.\r\nDo you amend it, then. It lies in you.\r\nWhy should Titania cross her Oberon?\r\nI do but beg a little changeling boy\r\nTo be my henchman.\r\n\r\nTITANIA.\r\nSet your heart at rest;\r\nThe fairyland buys not the child of me.\r\nHis mother was a vot’ress of my order,\r\nAnd in the spicèd Indian air, by night,\r\nFull often hath she gossip’d by my side;\r\nAnd sat with me on Neptune’s yellow sands,\r\nMarking th’ embarkèd traders on the flood,\r\nWhen we have laugh’d to see the sails conceive,\r\nAnd grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;\r\nWhich she, with pretty and with swimming gait\r\nFollowing (her womb then rich with my young squire),\r\nWould imitate, and sail upon the land,\r\nTo fetch me trifles, and return again,\r\nAs from a voyage, rich with merchandise.\r\nBut she, being mortal, of that boy did die;\r\nAnd for her sake do I rear up her boy,\r\nAnd for her sake I will not part with him.\r\n\r\nOBERON.\r\nHow long within this wood intend you stay?\r\n\r\nTITANIA.\r\nPerchance till after Theseus’ wedding-day.\r\nIf you will patiently dance in our round,\r\nAnd see our moonlight revels, go with us;\r\nIf not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.\r\n\r\nOBERON.\r\nGive me that boy and I will go with thee.\r\n\r\nTITANIA.\r\nNot for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away.\r\nWe shall chide downright if I longer stay.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Titania with her Train._]\r\n\r\nOBERON.\r\nWell, go thy way. Thou shalt not from this grove\r\nTill I torment thee for this injury.—\r\nMy gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememb’rest\r\nSince once I sat upon a promontory,\r\nAnd heard a mermaid on a dolphin’s back\r\nUttering such dulcet and harmonious breath\r\nThat the rude sea grew civil at her song\r\nAnd certain stars shot madly from their spheres\r\nTo hear the sea-maid’s music.\r\n\r\nPUCK.\r\nI remember.\r\n\r\nOBERON.\r\nThat very time I saw, (but thou couldst not),\r\nFlying between the cold moon and the earth,\r\nCupid all arm’d: a certain aim he took\r\nAt a fair vestal, thronèd by the west,\r\nAnd loos’d his love-shaft smartly from his bow\r\nAs it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts.\r\nBut I might see young Cupid’s fiery shaft\r\nQuench’d in the chaste beams of the watery moon;\r\nAnd the imperial votress passed on,\r\nIn maiden meditation, fancy-free.\r\nYet mark’d I where the bolt of Cupid fell:\r\nIt fell upon a little western flower,\r\nBefore milk-white, now purple with love’s wound,\r\nAnd maidens call it love-in-idleness.\r\nFetch me that flower, the herb I showed thee once:\r\nThe juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid\r\nWill make or man or woman madly dote\r\nUpon the next live creature that it sees.\r\nFetch me this herb, and be thou here again\r\nEre the leviathan can swim a league.\r\n\r\nPUCK.\r\nI’ll put a girdle round about the earth\r\nIn forty minutes.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Puck._]\r\n\r\nOBERON.\r\nHaving once this juice,\r\nI’ll watch Titania when she is asleep,\r\nAnd drop the liquor of it in her eyes:\r\nThe next thing then she waking looks upon\r\n(Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,\r\nOn meddling monkey, or on busy ape)\r\nShe shall pursue it with the soul of love.\r\nAnd ere I take this charm from off her sight\r\n(As I can take it with another herb)\r\nI’ll make her render up her page to me.\r\nBut who comes here? I am invisible;\r\nAnd I will overhear their conference.\r\n\r\n Enter Demetrius, Helena following him.\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS.\r\nI love thee not, therefore pursue me not.\r\nWhere is Lysander and fair Hermia?\r\nThe one I’ll slay, the other slayeth me.\r\nThou told’st me they were stol’n into this wood,\r\nAnd here am I, and wode within this wood\r\nBecause I cannot meet with Hermia.\r\nHence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.\r\n\r\nHELENA.\r\nYou draw me, you hard-hearted adamant,\r\nBut yet you draw not iron, for my heart\r\nIs true as steel. Leave you your power to draw,\r\nAnd I shall have no power to follow you.\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS.\r\nDo I entice you? Do I speak you fair?\r\nOr rather do I not in plainest truth\r\nTell you I do not, nor I cannot love you?\r\n\r\nHELENA.\r\nAnd even for that do I love you the more.\r\nI am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,\r\nThe more you beat me, I will fawn on you.\r\nUse me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,\r\nNeglect me, lose me; only give me leave,\r\nUnworthy as I am, to follow you.\r\nWhat worser place can I beg in your love,\r\n(And yet a place of high respect with me)\r\nThan to be usèd as you use your dog?\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS.\r\nTempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;\r\nFor I am sick when I do look on thee.\r\n\r\nHELENA.\r\nAnd I am sick when I look not on you.\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS.\r\nYou do impeach your modesty too much\r\nTo leave the city and commit yourself\r\nInto the hands of one that loves you not,\r\nTo trust the opportunity of night\r\nAnd the ill counsel of a desert place,\r\nWith the rich worth of your virginity.\r\n\r\nHELENA.\r\nYour virtue is my privilege: for that\r\nIt is not night when I do see your face,\r\nTherefore I think I am not in the night;\r\nNor doth this wood lack worlds of company,\r\nFor you, in my respect, are all the world.\r\nThen how can it be said I am alone\r\nWhen all the world is here to look on me?\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS.\r\nI’ll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,\r\nAnd leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.\r\n\r\nHELENA.\r\nThe wildest hath not such a heart as you.\r\nRun when you will, the story shall be chang’d;\r\nApollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;\r\nThe dove pursues the griffin, the mild hind\r\nMakes speed to catch the tiger. Bootless speed,\r\nWhen cowardice pursues and valour flies!\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS.\r\nI will not stay thy questions. Let me go,\r\nOr if thou follow me, do not believe\r\nBut I shall do thee mischief in the wood.\r\n\r\nHELENA.\r\nAy, in the temple, in the town, the field,\r\nYou do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!\r\nYour wrongs do set a scandal on my sex.\r\nWe cannot fight for love as men may do.\r\nWe should be woo’d, and were not made to woo.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Demetrius._]\r\n\r\nI’ll follow thee, and make a heaven of hell,\r\nTo die upon the hand I love so well.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Helena._]\r\n\r\nOBERON.\r\nFare thee well, nymph. Ere he do leave this grove,\r\nThou shalt fly him, and he shall seek thy love.\r\n\r\n Enter Puck.\r\n\r\nHast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer.\r\n\r\nPUCK.\r\nAy, there it is.\r\n\r\nOBERON.\r\nI pray thee give it me.\r\nI know a bank where the wild thyme blows,\r\nWhere oxlips and the nodding violet grows,\r\nQuite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,\r\nWith sweet musk-roses, and with eglantine.\r\nThere sleeps Titania sometime of the night,\r\nLull’d in these flowers with dances and delight;\r\nAnd there the snake throws her enamell’d skin,\r\nWeed wide enough to wrap a fairy in.\r\nAnd with the juice of this I’ll streak her eyes,\r\nAnd make her full of hateful fantasies.\r\nTake thou some of it, and seek through this grove:\r\nA sweet Athenian lady is in love\r\nWith a disdainful youth. Anoint his eyes;\r\nBut do it when the next thing he espies\r\nMay be the lady.

The Wood.\r\n\n The Queen of Fairies still lying asleep.\r\n\r\n Enter Bottom, Quince, Snout, Starveling, Snug and Flute.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM.\r\nAre we all met?\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nPat, pat; and here’s a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal.\r\nThis green plot shall be our stage, this hawthorn brake our\r\ntiring-house; and we will do it in action, as we will do it before the\r\nDuke.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM.\r\nPeter Quince?\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nWhat sayest thou, bully Bottom?\r\n\r\nBOTTOM.\r\nThere are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe that will never\r\nplease. First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself; which the\r\nladies cannot abide. How answer you that?\r\n\r\nSNOUT\r\nBy’r lakin, a parlous fear.\r\n\r\nSTARVELING.\r\nI believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM.\r\nNot a whit; I have a device to make all well. Write me a prologue, and\r\nlet the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords, and\r\nthat Pyramus is not killed indeed; and for the more better assurance,\r\ntell them that I Pyramus am not Pyramus but Bottom the weaver. This\r\nwill put them out of fear.\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nWell, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be written in eight\r\nand six.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM.\r\nNo, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.\r\n\r\nSNOUT\r\nWill not the ladies be afeard of the lion?\r\n\r\nSTARVELING.\r\nI fear it, I promise you.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM.\r\nMasters, you ought to consider with yourselves, to bring in (God shield\r\nus!) a lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing. For there is not a\r\nmore fearful wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to look to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSNOUT\r\nTherefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM.\r\nNay, you must name his name, and half his face must be seen through the\r\nlion’s neck; and he himself must speak through, saying thus, or to the\r\nsame defect: ‘Ladies,’ or, ‘Fair ladies, I would wish you,’ or, ‘I\r\nwould request you,’ or, ’I would entreat you, not to fear, not to\r\ntremble: my life for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it\r\nwere pity of my life. No, I am no such thing; I am a man as other men\r\nare’: and there, indeed, let him name his name, and tell them plainly\r\nhe is Snug the joiner.\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nWell, it shall be so. But there is two hard things: that is, to bring\r\nthe moonlight into a chamber, for you know, Pyramus and Thisbe meet by\r\nmoonlight.\r\n\r\nSNOUT\r\nDoth the moon shine that night we play our play?\r\n\r\nBOTTOM.\r\nA calendar, a calendar! Look in the almanack; find out moonshine, find\r\nout moonshine.\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nYes, it doth shine that night.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM.\r\nWhy, then may you leave a casement of the great chamber window, where\r\nwe play, open; and the moon may shine in at the casement.\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nAy; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern, and\r\nsay he comes to disfigure or to present the person of Moonshine. Then\r\nthere is another thing: we must have a wall in the great chamber; for\r\nPyramus and Thisbe, says the story, did talk through the chink of a\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nSNOUT\r\nYou can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?\r\n\r\nBOTTOM.\r\nSome man or other must present Wall. And let him have some plaster, or\r\nsome loam, or some rough-cast about him, to signify wall; and let him\r\nhold his fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisbe\r\nwhisper.\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nIf that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down, every mother’s son,\r\nand rehearse your parts. Pyramus, you begin: when you have spoken your\r\nspeech, enter into that brake; and so everyone according to his cue.\r\n\r\n Enter Puck behind.\r\n\r\nPUCK.\r\nWhat hempen homespuns have we swaggering here,\r\nSo near the cradle of the Fairy Queen?\r\nWhat, a play toward? I’ll be an auditor;\r\nAn actor too perhaps, if I see cause.\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nSpeak, Pyramus.—Thisbe, stand forth.\r\n\r\nPYRAMUS.\r\n_Thisbe, the flowers of odious savours sweet_\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nOdours, odours.\r\n\r\nPYRAMUS.\r\n_. . . odours savours sweet.\r\nSo hath thy breath, my dearest Thisbe dear.\r\nBut hark, a voice! Stay thou but here awhile,\r\nAnd by and by I will to thee appear._\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nPUCK.\r\nA stranger Pyramus than e’er played here!\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nTHISBE.\r\nMust I speak now?\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nAy, marry, must you, For you must understand he goes but to see a noise\r\nthat he heard, and is to come again.\r\n\r\nTHISBE.\r\n_Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue,\r\nOf colour like the red rose on triumphant brier,\r\nMost brisky juvenal, and eke most lovely Jew,\r\nAs true as truest horse, that yet would never tire,\r\nI’ll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny’s tomb._\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nNinus’ tomb, man! Why, you must not speak that yet. That you answer to\r\nPyramus. You speak all your part at once, cues, and all.—Pyramus enter!\r\nYour cue is past; it is ‘never tire.’\r\n\r\nTHISBE.\r\nO, _As true as truest horse, that yet would never tire._\r\n\r\n Enter Puck and Bottom with an ass’s head.\r\n\r\nPYRAMUS.\r\n_If I were fair, Thisbe, I were only thine._\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nO monstrous! O strange! We are haunted. Pray, masters, fly, masters!\r\nHelp!\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Clowns._]\r\n\r\nPUCK.\r\nI’ll follow you. I’ll lead you about a round,\r\n Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier;\r\nSometime a horse I’ll be, sometime a hound,\r\n A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire;\r\nAnd neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,\r\nLike horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nBOTTOM.\r\nWhy do they run away? This is a knavery of them to make me afeard.\r\n\r\n Enter Snout.\r\n\r\nSNOUT\r\nO Bottom, thou art changed! What do I see on thee?\r\n\r\nBOTTOM.\r\nWhat do you see? You see an ass-head of your own, do you?\r\n\r\n [_Exit Snout._]\r\n\r\n Enter Quince.\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nBless thee, Bottom! bless thee! Thou art translated.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nBOTTOM.\r\nI see their knavery. This is to make an ass of me, to fright me, if\r\nthey could. But I will not stir from this place, do what they can. I\r\nwill walk up and down here, and I will sing, that they shall hear I am\r\nnot afraid.\r\n[_Sings._]\r\n The ousel cock, so black of hue,\r\n With orange-tawny bill,\r\n The throstle with his note so true,\r\n The wren with little quill.\r\n\r\nTITANIA.\r\n[_Waking._] What angel wakes me from my flowery bed?\r\n\r\nBOTTOM.\r\n[_Sings._]\r\n The finch, the sparrow, and the lark,\r\n The plain-song cuckoo gray,\r\n Whose note full many a man doth mark,\r\n And dares not answer nay.\r\nfor, indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish a bird? Who would give\r\na bird the lie, though he cry ‘cuckoo’ never so?\r\n\r\nTITANIA.\r\nI pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again.\r\nMine ear is much enamour’d of thy note.\r\nSo is mine eye enthrallèd to thy shape;\r\nAnd thy fair virtue’s force perforce doth move me,\r\nOn the first view, to say, to swear, I love thee.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM.\r\nMethinks, mistress, you should have little reason for that. And yet, to\r\nsay the truth, reason and love keep little company together nowadays.\r\nThe more the pity that some honest neighbours will not make them\r\nfriends. Nay, I can gleek upon occasion.\r\n\r\nTITANIA.\r\nThou art as wise as thou art beautiful.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM.\r\nNot so, neither; but if I had wit enough to get out of this wood, I\r\nhave enough to serve mine own turn.\r\n\r\nTITANIA.\r\nOut of this wood do not desire to go.\r\nThou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no.\r\nI am a spirit of no common rate.\r\nThe summer still doth tend upon my state;\r\nAnd I do love thee: therefore, go with me.\r\nI’ll give thee fairies to attend on thee;\r\nAnd they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,\r\nAnd sing, while thou on pressèd flowers dost sleep.\r\nAnd I will purge thy mortal grossness so\r\nThat thou shalt like an airy spirit go.—\r\nPeaseblossom!

That same cowardly\r\ngiant-like ox-beef hath devoured many a gentleman of your house. I\r\npromise you, your kindred hath made my eyes water ere now. I desire you\r\nof more acquaintance, good Master Mustardseed.\r\n\r\nTITANIA.\r\nCome, wait upon him; lead him to my bower.\r\n The moon, methinks, looks with a watery eye,\r\nAnd when she weeps, weeps every little flower,\r\n Lamenting some enforced chastity.\r\nTie up my love’s tongue, bring him silently.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\nSCENE II. Another part of the wood\r\n\r\n Enter Oberon.\r\n\r\nOBERON.\r\nI wonder if Titania be awak’d;\r\nThen, what it was that next came in her eye,\r\nWhich she must dote on in extremity.\r\n\r\n Enter Puck.\r\n\r\nHere comes my messenger. How now, mad spirit?\r\nWhat night-rule now about this haunted grove?\r\n\r\nPUCK.\r\nMy mistress with a monster is in love.\r\nNear to her close and consecrated bower,\r\nWhile she was in her dull and sleeping hour,\r\nA crew of patches, rude mechanicals,\r\nThat work for bread upon Athenian stalls,\r\nWere met together to rehearse a play\r\nIntended for great Theseus’ nuptial day.\r\nThe shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort\r\nWho Pyramus presented in their sport,\r\nForsook his scene and enter’d in a brake.\r\nWhen I did him at this advantage take,\r\nAn ass’s nole I fixed on his head.\r\nAnon, his Thisbe must be answerèd,\r\nAnd forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,\r\nAs wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,\r\nOr russet-pated choughs, many in sort,\r\nRising and cawing at the gun’s report,\r\nSever themselves and madly sweep the sky,\r\nSo at his sight away his fellows fly,\r\nAnd at our stamp, here o’er and o’er one falls;\r\nHe murder cries, and help from Athens calls.\r\nTheir sense thus weak, lost with their fears, thus strong,\r\nMade senseless things begin to do them wrong;\r\nFor briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;\r\nSome sleeves, some hats, from yielders all things catch.\r\nI led them on in this distracted fear,\r\nAnd left sweet Pyramus translated there.\r\nWhen in that moment, so it came to pass,\r\nTitania wak’d, and straightway lov’d an ass.\r\n\r\nOBERON.\r\nThis falls out better than I could devise.\r\nBut hast thou yet latch’d the Athenian’s eyes\r\nWith the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?\r\n\r\nPUCK.\r\nI took him sleeping—that is finish’d too—\r\nAnd the Athenian woman by his side,\r\nThat, when he wak’d, of force she must be ey’d.\r\n\r\n Enter Demetrius and Hermia.\r\n\r\nOBERON.\r\nStand close.

Where is he?\r\nAh, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS.\r\nI had rather give his carcass to my hounds.\r\n\r\nHERMIA.\r\nOut, dog! Out, cur! Thou driv’st me past the bounds\r\nOf maiden’s patience.

Wherefore? O me! what news, my love?\r\nAm not I Hermia? Are not you Lysander?\r\nI am as fair now as I was erewhile.\r\nSince night you lov’d me; yet since night you left me.\r\nWhy then, you left me—O, the gods forbid!—\r\nIn earnest, shall I say?\r\n\r\nLYSANDER.\r\nAy, by my life;\r\nAnd never did desire to see thee more.\r\nTherefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt;\r\nBe certain, nothing truer; ’tis no jest\r\nThat I do hate thee and love Helena.\r\n\r\nHERMIA.\r\nO me!

What, will you tear\r\nImpatient answers from my gentle tongue?\r\nFie, fie, you counterfeit, you puppet, you!\r\n\r\nHERMIA.\r\nPuppet! Why so? Ay, that way goes the game.\r\nNow I perceive that she hath made compare\r\nBetween our statures; she hath urg’d her height;\r\nAnd with her personage, her tall personage,\r\nHer height, forsooth, she hath prevail’d with him.\r\nAnd are you grown so high in his esteem\r\nBecause I am so dwarfish and so low?\r\nHow low am I, thou painted maypole? Speak,\r\nHow low am I? I am not yet so low\r\nBut that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.\r\n\r\nHELENA.\r\nI pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,\r\nLet her not hurt me. I was never curst;\r\nI have no gift at all in shrewishness;\r\nI am a right maid for my cowardice;\r\nLet her not strike me. You perhaps may think,\r\nBecause she is something lower than myself,\r\nThat I can match her.\r\n\r\nHERMIA.\r\nLower! Hark, again.\r\n\r\nHELENA.\r\nGood Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.\r\nI evermore did love you, Hermia,\r\nDid ever keep your counsels, never wrong’d you,\r\nSave that, in love unto Demetrius,\r\nI told him of your stealth unto this wood.\r\nHe follow’d you; for love I follow’d him;\r\nBut he hath chid me hence, and threaten’d me\r\nTo strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too:\r\nAnd now, so you will let me quiet go,\r\nTo Athens will I bear my folly back,\r\nAnd follow you no further. Let me go:\r\nYou see how simple and how fond I am.\r\n\r\nHERMIA.\r\nWhy, get you gone. Who is’t that hinders you?\r\n\r\nHELENA.\r\nA foolish heart that I leave here behind.\r\n\r\nHERMIA.\r\nWhat! with Lysander?\r\n\r\nHELENA.\r\nWith Demetrius.\r\n\r\nLYSANDER.\r\nBe not afraid; she shall not harm thee, Helena.\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS.\r\nNo, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.\r\n\r\nHELENA.\r\nO, when she’s angry, she is keen and shrewd.\r\nShe was a vixen when she went to school,\r\nAnd though she be but little, she is fierce.\r\n\r\nHERMIA.\r\nLittle again! Nothing but low and little?\r\nWhy will you suffer her to flout me thus?\r\nLet me come to her.\r\n\r\nLYSANDER.\r\nGet you gone, you dwarf;\r\nYou minimus, of hind’ring knot-grass made;\r\nYou bead, you acorn.\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS.\r\nYou are too officious\r\nIn her behalf that scorns your services.\r\nLet her alone. Speak not of Helena;\r\nTake not her part; for if thou dost intend\r\nNever so little show of love to her,\r\nThou shalt aby it.\r\n\r\nLYSANDER.\r\nNow she holds me not.\r\nNow follow, if thou dar’st, to try whose right,\r\nOf thine or mine, is most in Helena.\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS.\r\nFollow!

Seest thou this sweet sight?\r\nHer dotage now I do begin to pity.\r\nFor, meeting her of late behind the wood,\r\nSeeking sweet favours for this hateful fool,\r\nI did upbraid her and fall out with her:\r\nFor she his hairy temples then had rounded\r\nWith coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;\r\nAnd that same dew, which sometime on the buds\r\nWas wont to swell like round and orient pearls,\r\nStood now within the pretty flouriets’ eyes,\r\nLike tears that did their own disgrace bewail.\r\nWhen I had at my pleasure taunted her,\r\nAnd she in mild terms begg’d my patience,\r\nI then did ask of her her changeling child;\r\nWhich straight she gave me, and her fairy sent\r\nTo bear him to my bower in fairyland.\r\nAnd now I have the boy, I will undo\r\nThis hateful imperfection of her eyes.\r\nAnd, gentle Puck, take this transformèd scalp\r\nFrom off the head of this Athenian swain,\r\nThat he awaking when the other do,\r\nMay all to Athens back again repair,\r\nAnd think no more of this night’s accidents\r\nBut as the fierce vexation of a dream.\r\nBut first I will release the Fairy Queen.\r\n\r\n [_Touching her eyes with an herb._]\r\n\r\n Be as thou wast wont to be;\r\n See as thou was wont to see.\r\n Dian’s bud o’er Cupid’s flower\r\n Hath such force and blessed power.\r\nNow, my Titania, wake you, my sweet queen.\r\n\r\nTITANIA.\r\nMy Oberon, what visions have I seen!\r\nMethought I was enamour’d of an ass.\r\n\r\nOBERON.\r\nThere lies your love.\r\n\r\nTITANIA.\r\nHow came these things to pass?\r\nO, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!\r\n\r\nOBERON.\r\nSilence awhile.—Robin, take off this head.\r\nTitania, music call; and strike more dead\r\nThan common sleep, of all these five the sense.\r\n\r\nTITANIA.\r\nMusic, ho, music, such as charmeth sleep.\r\n\r\nPUCK.\r\nNow when thou wak’st, with thine own fool’s eyes peep.\r\n\r\nOBERON.\r\nSound, music.\r\n\r\n [_Still music._]\r\n\r\nCome, my queen, take hands with me,\r\nAnd rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.\r\nNow thou and I are new in amity,\r\nAnd will tomorrow midnight solemnly\r\nDance in Duke Theseus’ house triumphantly,\r\nAnd bless it to all fair prosperity:\r\nThere shall the pairs of faithful lovers be\r\nWedded, with Theseus, all in jollity.\r\n\r\nPUCK.\r\n Fairy king, attend and mark.\r\n I do hear the morning lark.\r\n\r\nOBERON.\r\n Then, my queen, in silence sad,\r\n Trip we after night’s shade.\r\n We the globe can compass soon,\r\n Swifter than the wand’ring moon.\r\n\r\nTITANIA.\r\n Come, my lord, and in our flight,\r\n Tell me how it came this night\r\n That I sleeping here was found\r\n With these mortals on the ground.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt. Horns sound within._]\r\n\r\n Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Egeus and Train.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nGo, one of you, find out the forester;\r\nFor now our observation is perform’d;\r\nAnd since we have the vaward of the day,\r\nMy love shall hear the music of my hounds.\r\nUncouple in the western valley; let them go.\r\nDispatch I say, and find the forester.\r\n\r\n [_Exit an Attendant._]\r\n\r\nWe will, fair queen, up to the mountain’s top,\r\nAnd mark the musical confusion\r\nOf hounds and echo in conjunction.\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA.\r\nI was with Hercules and Cadmus once,\r\nWhen in a wood of Crete they bay’d the bear\r\nWith hounds of Sparta. Never did I hear\r\nSuch gallant chiding; for, besides the groves,\r\nThe skies, the fountains, every region near\r\nSeem’d all one mutual cry. I never heard\r\nSo musical a discord, such sweet thunder.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nMy hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,\r\nSo flew’d, so sanded; and their heads are hung\r\nWith ears that sweep away the morning dew;\r\nCrook-knee’d and dewlap’d like Thessalian bulls;\r\nSlow in pursuit, but match’d in mouth like bells,\r\nEach under each. A cry more tuneable\r\nWas never holla’d to, nor cheer’d with horn,\r\nIn Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly.\r\nJudge when you hear.—But, soft, what nymphs are these?\r\n\r\nEGEUS.\r\nMy lord, this is my daughter here asleep,\r\nAnd this Lysander; this Demetrius is;\r\nThis Helena, old Nedar’s Helena:\r\nI wonder of their being here together.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nNo doubt they rose up early to observe\r\nThe rite of May; and, hearing our intent,\r\nCame here in grace of our solemnity.\r\nBut speak, Egeus; is not this the day\r\nThat Hermia should give answer of her choice?\r\n\r\nEGEUS.\r\nIt is, my lord.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nGo, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.\r\n\r\n Horns, and shout within. Demetrius, Lysander, Hermia and Helena wake\r\n and start up.\r\n\r\nGood morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past.\r\nBegin these wood-birds but to couple now?\r\n\r\nLYSANDER.\r\nPardon, my lord.\r\n\r\n He and the rest kneel to Theseus.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nI pray you all, stand up.\r\nI know you two are rival enemies.\r\nHow comes this gentle concord in the world,\r\nThat hatred is so far from jealousy\r\nTo sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?\r\n\r\nLYSANDER.\r\nMy lord, I shall reply amazedly,\r\nHalf sleep, half waking; but as yet, I swear,\r\nI cannot truly say how I came here.\r\nBut, as I think (for truly would I speak)\r\nAnd now I do bethink me, so it is:\r\nI came with Hermia hither. Our intent\r\nWas to be gone from Athens, where we might be\r\nWithout the peril of the Athenian law.\r\n\r\nEGEUS.\r\nEnough, enough, my lord; you have enough.\r\nI beg the law, the law upon his head.\r\nThey would have stol’n away, they would, Demetrius,\r\nThereby to have defeated you and me:\r\nYou of your wife, and me of my consent,\r\nOf my consent that she should be your wife.\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS.\r\nMy lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,\r\nOf this their purpose hither to this wood;\r\nAnd I in fury hither follow’d them,\r\nFair Helena in fancy following me.\r\nBut, my good lord, I wot not by what power,\r\n(But by some power it is) my love to Hermia,\r\nMelted as the snow, seems to me now\r\nAs the remembrance of an idle gaud\r\nWhich in my childhood I did dote upon;\r\nAnd all the faith, the virtue of my heart,\r\nThe object and the pleasure of mine eye,\r\nIs only Helena. To her, my lord,\r\nWas I betroth’d ere I saw Hermia.\r\nBut like a sickness did I loathe this food.\r\nBut, as in health, come to my natural taste,\r\nNow I do wish it, love it, long for it,\r\nAnd will for evermore be true to it.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nFair lovers, you are fortunately met.\r\nOf this discourse we more will hear anon.\r\nEgeus, I will overbear your will;\r\nFor in the temple, by and by with us,\r\nThese couples shall eternally be knit.\r\nAnd, for the morning now is something worn,\r\nOur purpos’d hunting shall be set aside.\r\nAway with us to Athens. Three and three,\r\nWe’ll hold a feast in great solemnity.\r\nCome, Hippolyta.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Theseus, Hippolyta, Egeus and Train._]\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS.\r\nThese things seem small and undistinguishable,\r\nLike far-off mountains turnèd into clouds.\r\n\r\nHERMIA.\r\nMethinks I see these things with parted eye,\r\nWhen everything seems double.\r\n\r\nHELENA.\r\nSo methinks.\r\nAnd I have found Demetrius like a jewel,\r\nMine own, and not mine own.\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS.\r\nAre you sure\r\nThat we are awake? It seems to me\r\nThat yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think\r\nThe Duke was here, and bid us follow him?\r\n\r\nHERMIA.\r\nYea, and my father.\r\n\r\nHELENA.\r\nAnd Hippolyta.\r\n\r\nLYSANDER.\r\nAnd he did bid us follow to the temple.\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS.\r\nWhy, then, we are awake: let’s follow him,\r\nAnd by the way let us recount our dreams.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nBOTTOM.\r\n[_Waking._] When my cue comes, call me, and I will answer. My next is\r\n‘Most fair Pyramus.’ Heigh-ho! Peter Quince! Flute, the bellows-mender!\r\nSnout, the tinker! Starveling! God’s my life! Stol’n hence, and left me\r\nasleep! I have had a most rare vision. I have had a dream, past the wit\r\nof man to say what dream it was. Man is but an ass if he go about to\r\nexpound this dream. Methought I was—there is no man can tell what.\r\nMethought I was, and methought I had—but man is but a patched fool if\r\nhe will offer to say what methought I had. The eye of man hath not\r\nheard, the ear of man hath not seen, man’s hand is not able to taste,\r\nhis tongue to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream was. I\r\nwill get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream: it shall be\r\ncalled ‘Bottom’s Dream’, because it hath no bottom; and I will sing it\r\nin the latter end of a play, before the Duke. Peradventure, to make it\r\nthe more gracious, I shall sing it at her death.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\nSCENE II. Athens. A Room in Quince’s House\r\n\r\n Enter Quince, Flute, Snout and Starveling.\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nHave you sent to Bottom’s house? Is he come home yet?\r\n\r\nSTARVELING.\r\nHe cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he is transported.\r\n\r\nFLUTE.\r\nIf he come not, then the play is marred. It goes not forward, doth it?\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nIt is not possible. You have not a man in all Athens able to discharge\r\nPyramus but he.\r\n\r\nFLUTE.\r\nNo, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in Athens.\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nYea, and the best person too, and he is a very paramour for a sweet\r\nvoice.\r\n\nFLUTE.\r\nYou must say paragon. A paramour is, God bless us, a thing of naught.\r\n\r\n Enter Snug.\r\n\r\nSNUG\r\nMasters, the Duke is coming from the temple, and there is two or three\r\nlords and ladies more married. If our sport had gone forward, we had\r\nall been made men.\r\n\r\nFLUTE.\r\nO sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life;\r\nhe could not have ’scaped sixpence a day. An the Duke had not given him\r\nsixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I’ll be hanged. He would have\r\ndeserved it: sixpence a day in Pyramus, or nothing.\r\n\r\n Enter Bottom.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM.\r\nWhere are these lads? Where are these hearts?\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nBottom! O most courageous day! O most happy hour!\r\n\r\nBOTTOM.\r\nMasters, I am to discourse wonders: but ask me not what; for if I tell\r\nyou, I am not true Athenian. I will tell you everything, right as it\r\nfell out.\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\nLet us hear, sweet Bottom.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM.\r\nNot a word of me. All that I will tell you is, that the Duke hath\r\ndined. Get your apparel together, good strings to your beards, new\r\nribbons to your pumps; meet presently at the palace; every man look\r\no’er his part. For the short and the long is, our play is preferred. In\r\nany case, let Thisbe have clean linen; and let not him that plays the\r\nlion pare his nails, for they shall hang out for the lion’s claws. And\r\nmost dear actors, eat no onions nor garlick, for we are to utter sweet\r\nbreath; and I do not doubt but to hear them say it is a sweet comedy.\r\nNo more words. Away! Go, away!\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\nACT V\r\n\r\nSCENE I. Athens. An Apartment in the Palace of Theseus\r\n\n Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Philostrate, Lords and Attendants.\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA.\r\n’Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nMore strange than true. I never may believe\r\nThese antique fables, nor these fairy toys.\r\nLovers and madmen have such seething brains,\r\nSuch shaping fantasies, that apprehend\r\nMore than cool reason ever comprehends.\r\nThe lunatic, the lover, and the poet\r\nAre of imagination all compact:\r\nOne sees more devils than vast hell can hold;\r\nThat is the madman: the lover, all as frantic,\r\nSees Helen’s beauty in a brow of Egypt:\r\nThe poet’s eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,\r\nDoth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;\r\nAnd as imagination bodies forth\r\nThe forms of things unknown, the poet’s pen\r\nTurns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing\r\nA local habitation and a name.\r\nSuch tricks hath strong imagination,\r\nThat if it would but apprehend some joy,\r\nIt comprehends some bringer of that joy.\r\nOr in the night, imagining some fear,\r\nHow easy is a bush supposed a bear?\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA.\r\nBut all the story of the night told over,\r\nAnd all their minds transfigur’d so together,\r\nMore witnesseth than fancy’s images,\r\nAnd grows to something of great constancy;\r\nBut, howsoever, strange and admirable.\r\n\r\n Enter lovers: Lysander, Demetrius, Hermia and Helena.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nHere come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.\r\nJoy, gentle friends, joy and fresh days of love\r\nAccompany your hearts!\r\n\r\nLYSANDER.\r\nMore than to us\r\nWait in your royal walks, your board, your bed!\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nCome now; what masques, what dances shall we have,\r\nTo wear away this long age of three hours\r\nBetween our after-supper and bed-time?\r\nWhere is our usual manager of mirth?\r\nWhat revels are in hand? Is there no play\r\nTo ease the anguish of a torturing hour?\r\nCall Philostrate.\r\n\r\nPHILOSTRATE.\r\nHere, mighty Theseus.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nSay, what abridgment have you for this evening?\r\nWhat masque? What music? How shall we beguile\r\nThe lazy time, if not with some delight?\r\n\r\nPHILOSTRATE.\r\nThere is a brief how many sports are ripe.\r\nMake choice of which your Highness will see first.\r\n\r\n [_Giving a paper._]\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\n[_Reads_] ‘The battle with the Centaurs, to be sung\r\nBy an Athenian eunuch to the harp.’\r\nWe’ll none of that. That have I told my love\r\nIn glory of my kinsman Hercules.\r\n‘The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,\r\nTearing the Thracian singer in their rage?’\r\nThat is an old device, and it was play’d\r\nWhen I from Thebes came last a conqueror.\r\n‘The thrice three Muses mourning for the death\r\nOf learning, late deceas’d in beggary.’\r\nThat is some satire, keen and critical,\r\nNot sorting with a nuptial ceremony.\r\n‘A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus\r\nAnd his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth.’\r\nMerry and tragical? Tedious and brief?\r\nThat is hot ice and wondrous strange snow.\r\nHow shall we find the concord of this discord?\r\n\r\nPHILOSTRATE.\r\nA play there is, my lord, some ten words long,\r\nWhich is as brief as I have known a play;\r\nBut by ten words, my lord, it is too long,\r\nWhich makes it tedious. For in all the play\r\nThere is not one word apt, one player fitted.\r\nAnd tragical, my noble lord, it is.\r\nFor Pyramus therein doth kill himself,\r\nWhich, when I saw rehears’d, I must confess,\r\nMade mine eyes water; but more merry tears\r\nThe passion of loud laughter never shed.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nWhat are they that do play it?\r\n\r\nPHILOSTRATE.\r\nHard-handed men that work in Athens here,\r\nWhich never labour’d in their minds till now;\r\nAnd now have toil’d their unbreath’d memories\r\nWith this same play against your nuptial.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nAnd we will hear it.\r\n\r\nPHILOSTRATE.\r\nNo, my noble lord,\r\nIt is not for you: I have heard it over,\r\nAnd it is nothing, nothing in the world;\r\nUnless you can find sport in their intents,\r\nExtremely stretch’d and conn’d with cruel pain\r\nTo do you service.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nI will hear that play;\r\nFor never anything can be amiss\r\nWhen simpleness and duty tender it.\r\nGo, bring them in: and take your places, ladies.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Philostrate._]\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA.\r\nI love not to see wretchedness o’ercharged,\r\nAnd duty in his service perishing.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nWhy, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA.\r\nHe says they can do nothing in this kind.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nThe kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.\r\nOur sport shall be to take what they mistake:\r\nAnd what poor duty cannot do, noble respect\r\nTakes it in might, not merit.\r\nWhere I have come, great clerks have purposed\r\nTo greet me with premeditated welcomes;\r\nWhere I have seen them shiver and look pale,\r\nMake periods in the midst of sentences,\r\nThrottle their practis’d accent in their fears,\r\nAnd, in conclusion, dumbly have broke off,\r\nNot paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,\r\nOut of this silence yet I pick’d a welcome;\r\nAnd in the modesty of fearful duty\r\nI read as much as from the rattling tongue\r\nOf saucy and audacious eloquence.\r\nLove, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity\r\nIn least speak most to my capacity.\r\n\r\n Enter Philostrate.\r\n\r\nPHILOSTRATE.\r\nSo please your grace, the Prologue is address’d.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nLet him approach.\r\n\r\n Flourish of trumpets. Enter the Prologue.\r\n\r\nPROLOGUE\r\nIf we offend, it is with our good will.\r\nThat you should think, we come not to offend,\r\nBut with good will. To show our simple skill,\r\nThat is the true beginning of our end.\r\nConsider then, we come but in despite.\r\nWe do not come, as minding to content you,\r\nOur true intent is. All for your delight\r\nWe are not here. That you should here repent you,\r\nThe actors are at hand, and, by their show,\r\nYou shall know all that you are like to know.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nThis fellow doth not stand upon points.\r\n\r\nLYSANDER.\r\nHe hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows not the stop. A\r\ngood moral, my lord: it is not enough to speak, but to speak true.\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA.\r\nIndeed he hath played on this prologue like a child on a recorder; a\r\nsound, but not in government.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nHis speech was like a tangled chain; nothing impaired, but all\r\ndisordered. Who is next?\r\n\r\n Enter Pyramus and Thisbe, Wall, Moonshine and Lion as in dumb show.\r\n\r\nPROLOGUE\r\nGentles, perchance you wonder at this show;\r\nBut wonder on, till truth make all things plain.\r\nThis man is Pyramus, if you would know;\r\nThis beauteous lady Thisbe is certain.\r\nThis man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present\r\nWall, that vile wall which did these lovers sunder;\r\nAnd through Wall’s chink, poor souls, they are content\r\nTo whisper, at the which let no man wonder.\r\nThis man, with lantern, dog, and bush of thorn,\r\nPresenteth Moonshine, for, if you will know,\r\nBy moonshine did these lovers think no scorn\r\nTo meet at Ninus’ tomb, there, there to woo.\r\nThis grisly beast (which Lion hight by name)\r\nThe trusty Thisbe, coming first by night,\r\nDid scare away, or rather did affright;\r\nAnd as she fled, her mantle she did fall;\r\nWhich Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.\r\nAnon comes Pyramus, sweet youth, and tall,\r\nAnd finds his trusty Thisbe’s mantle slain;\r\nWhereat with blade, with bloody blameful blade,\r\nHe bravely broach’d his boiling bloody breast;\r\nAnd Thisbe, tarrying in mulberry shade,\r\nHis dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,\r\nLet Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain,\r\nAt large discourse while here they do remain.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Prologue, Pyramus, Thisbe, Lion and Moonshine._]\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nI wonder if the lion be to speak.\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS.\r\nNo wonder, my lord. One lion may, when many asses do.\r\n\r\nWALL.\r\nIn this same interlude it doth befall\r\nThat I, one Snout by name, present a wall:\r\nAnd such a wall as I would have you think\r\nThat had in it a crannied hole or chink,\r\nThrough which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisbe,\r\nDid whisper often very secretly.\r\nThis loam, this rough-cast, and this stone, doth show\r\nThat I am that same wall; the truth is so:\r\nAnd this the cranny is, right and sinister,\r\nThrough which the fearful lovers are to whisper.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nWould you desire lime and hair to speak better?\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS.\r\nIt is the wittiest partition that ever I heard discourse, my lord.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nPyramus draws near the wall; silence.\r\n\r\n Enter Pyramus.\r\n\r\nPYRAMUS.\r\nO grim-look’d night! O night with hue so black!\r\nO night, which ever art when day is not!\r\nO night, O night, alack, alack, alack,\r\nI fear my Thisbe’s promise is forgot!\r\nAnd thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,\r\nThat stand’st between her father’s ground and mine;\r\nThou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,\r\nShow me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne.\r\n\r\n [_Wall holds up his fingers._]\r\n\r\nThanks, courteous wall: Jove shield thee well for this!\r\nBut what see I? No Thisbe do I see.\r\nO wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss,\r\nCurs’d be thy stones for thus deceiving me!\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nThe wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.\r\n\r\nPYRAMUS.\r\nNo, in truth, sir, he should not. ‘Deceiving me’ is Thisbe’s cue: she\r\nis to enter now, and I am to spy her through the wall. You shall see it\r\nwill fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.\r\n\r\n Enter Thisbe.\r\n\r\nTHISBE.\r\nO wall, full often hast thou heard my moans,\r\nFor parting my fair Pyramus and me.\r\nMy cherry lips have often kiss’d thy stones,\r\nThy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.\r\n\r\nPYRAMUS.\r\nI see a voice; now will I to the chink,\r\nTo spy an I can hear my Thisbe’s face.\r\nThisbe?\r\n\r\nTHISBE.\r\nMy love thou art, my love I think.\r\n\r\nPYRAMUS.\r\nThink what thou wilt, I am thy lover’s grace;\r\nAnd like Limander am I trusty still.\r\n\r\nTHISBE.\r\nAnd I like Helen, till the fates me kill.\r\n\r\nPYRAMUS.\r\nNot Shafalus to Procrus was so true.\r\n\r\nTHISBE.\r\nAs Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.\r\n\r\nPYRAMUS.\r\nO kiss me through the hole of this vile wall.\r\n\r\nTHISBE.\r\nI kiss the wall’s hole, not your lips at all.\r\n\r\nPYRAMUS.\r\nWilt thou at Ninny’s tomb meet me straightway?\r\n\r\nTHISBE.\r\n’Tide life, ’tide death, I come without delay.\r\n\r\nWALL.\r\nThus have I, Wall, my part discharged so;\r\nAnd, being done, thus Wall away doth go.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Wall, Pyramus and Thisbe._]\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nNow is the mural down between the two neighbours.\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS.\r\nNo remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear without warning.\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA.\r\nThis is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nThe best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst are no worse, if\r\nimagination amend them.\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA.\r\nIt must be your imagination then, and not theirs.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nIf we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves, they may pass\r\nfor excellent men. Here come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.\r\n\r\n Enter Lion and Moonshine.\r\n\r\nLION.\r\nYou, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear\r\nThe smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,\r\nMay now, perchance, both quake and tremble here,\r\nWhen lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.\r\nThen know that I, one Snug the joiner, am\r\nA lion fell, nor else no lion’s dam;\r\nFor if I should as lion come in strife\r\nInto this place, ’twere pity on my life.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nA very gentle beast, and of a good conscience.\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS.\r\nThe very best at a beast, my lord, that e’er I saw.\r\n\r\nLYSANDER.\r\nThis lion is a very fox for his valour.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nTrue; and a goose for his discretion.\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS.\r\nNot so, my lord, for his valour cannot carry his discretion, and the\r\nfox carries the goose.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nHis discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour; for the goose\r\ncarries not the fox. It is well; leave it to his discretion, and let us\r\nlisten to the moon.\r\n\r\nMOONSHINE.\r\nThis lanthorn doth the hornèd moon present.\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS.\r\nHe should have worn the horns on his head.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nHe is no crescent, and his horns are invisible within the\r\ncircumference.\r\n\r\nMOONSHINE.\r\nThis lanthorn doth the hornèd moon present;\r\nMyself the man i’ the moon do seem to be.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nThis is the greatest error of all the rest; the man should be put into\r\nthe lantern. How is it else the man i’ the moon?\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS.\r\nHe dares not come there for the candle, for you see, it is already in\r\nsnuff.\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA.\r\nI am aweary of this moon. Would he would change!\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nIt appears by his small light of discretion that he is in the wane; but\r\nyet, in courtesy, in all reason, we must stay the time.\r\n\r\nLYSANDER.\r\nProceed, Moon.\r\n\r\nMOON.\r\nAll that I have to say, is to tell you that the lantern is the moon; I\r\nthe man i’ the moon; this thorn-bush my thorn-bush; and this dog my\r\ndog.\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS.\r\nWhy, all these should be in the lantern, for all these are in the moon.\r\nBut silence; here comes Thisbe.\r\n\r\n Enter Thisbe.\r\n\r\nTHISBE.\r\nThis is old Ninny’s tomb. Where is my love?\r\n\r\nLION.\r\nOh!\r\n\r\n [_The Lion roars, Thisbe runs off._]\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS.\r\nWell roared, Lion.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nWell run, Thisbe.\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA.\r\nWell shone, Moon. Truly, the moon shines with a good grace.\r\n\r\n [_The Lion tears Thisbe’s mantle, and exit._]\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nWell moused, Lion.\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS.\r\nAnd then came Pyramus.\r\n\r\nLYSANDER.\r\nAnd so the lion vanished.\r\n\r\n Enter Pyramus.\r\n\r\nPYRAMUS.\r\nSweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;\r\nI thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright;\r\nFor, by thy gracious golden, glittering gleams,\r\nI trust to take of truest Thisbe sight.\r\n But stay! O spite!\r\n But mark, poor knight,\r\n What dreadful dole is here!\r\n Eyes, do you see?\r\n How can it be?\r\n O dainty duck! O dear!\r\n Thy mantle good,\r\n What, stained with blood?\r\n Approach, ye Furies fell!\r\n O Fates, come, come;\r\n Cut thread and thrum;\r\n Quail, rush, conclude, and quell!\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nThis passion, and the death of a dear friend, would go near to make a\r\nman look sad.\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA.\r\nBeshrew my heart, but I pity the man.\r\n\r\nPYRAMUS.\r\nO wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame,\r\nSince lion vile hath here deflower’d my dear?\r\nWhich is—no, no—which was the fairest dame\r\nThat liv’d, that lov’d, that lik’d, that look’d with cheer.\r\n Come, tears, confound!\r\n Out, sword, and wound\r\n The pap of Pyramus;\r\n Ay, that left pap,\r\n Where heart doth hop:\r\n Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.\r\n Now am I dead,\r\n Now am I fled;\r\n My soul is in the sky.\r\n Tongue, lose thy light!\r\n Moon, take thy flight!\r\n Now die, die, die, die, die.\r\n\r\n [_Dies. Exit Moonshine._]\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS.\r\nNo die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one.\r\n\r\nLYSANDER.\r\nLess than an ace, man; for he is dead, he is nothing.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nWith the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove an ass.\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA.\r\nHow chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes back and finds her\r\nlover?\r\n\nTHESEUS.\r\nShe will find him by starlight.\r\n\r\n Enter Thisbe.\r\n\r\nHere she comes, and her passion ends the play.\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA.\r\nMethinks she should not use a long one for such a Pyramus. I hope she\r\nwill be brief.\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS.\r\nA mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which Thisbe, is the\r\nbetter: he for a man, God warrant us; she for a woman, God bless us!\r\n\r\nLYSANDER.\r\nShe hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS.\r\nAnd thus she means, _videlicet_—\r\n\r\nTHISBE.\r\n Asleep, my love?\r\n What, dead, my dove?\r\n O Pyramus, arise,\r\n Speak, speak. Quite dumb?\r\n Dead, dead? A tomb\r\n Must cover thy sweet eyes.\r\n These lily lips,\r\n This cherry nose,\r\n These yellow cowslip cheeks,\r\n Are gone, are gone!\r\n Lovers, make moan;\r\n His eyes were green as leeks.\r\n O Sisters Three,\r\n Come, come to me,\r\n With hands as pale as milk;\r\n Lay them in gore,\r\n Since you have shore\r\n With shears his thread of silk.\r\n Tongue, not a word:\r\n Come, trusty sword,\r\n Come, blade, my breast imbrue;\r\n And farewell, friends.\r\n Thus Thisbe ends.\r\n Adieu, adieu, adieu.\r\n\r\n [_Dies._]\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nMoonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS.\r\nAy, and Wall too.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM.\r\nNo, I assure you; the wall is down that parted their fathers. Will it\r\nplease you to see the epilogue, or to hear a Bergomask dance between\r\ntwo of our company?\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nNo epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no excuse. Never excuse;\r\nfor when the players are all dead there need none to be blamed. Marry,\r\nif he that writ it had played Pyramus, and hanged himself in Thisbe’s\r\ngarter, it would have been a fine tragedy; and so it is, truly; and\r\nvery notably discharged. But come, your Bergomask; let your epilogue\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n [_Here a dance of Clowns._]\r\n\r\nThe iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve.\r\nLovers, to bed; ’tis almost fairy time.\r\nI fear we shall outsleep the coming morn\r\nAs much as we this night have overwatch’d.\r\nThis palpable-gross play hath well beguil’d\r\nThe heavy gait of night.

Messina.\r\n\nACT I\r\n\r\nSCENE I. Before Leonato’s House.\r\n\nEnter Leonato, Hero, Beatrice and others,\r\nwith a Messenger.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nI learn in this letter that Don Pedro of Arragon comes this night\r\nto Messina.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nHe is very near by this: he was not three leagues off when I left him.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nHow many gentlemen have you lost in this action?\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nBut few of any sort, and none of name.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nA victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full\r\nnumbers. I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honour on a\r\nyoung Florentine called Claudio.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nMuch deserved on his part, and equally remembered by Don Pedro.\r\nHe hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age, doing in the figure\r\nof a lamb the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better bettered expectation\r\nthan you must expect of me to tell you how.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nHe hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nI have already delivered him letters, and there appears much\r\njoy in him; even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough\r\nwithout a badge of bitterness.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nDid he break out into tears?\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nIn great measure.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nA kind overflow of kindness. There are no faces truer than those\r\nthat are so washed; how much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at\r\nweeping!\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nI pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the wars or no?\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nI know none of that name, lady: there was none such in the army\r\nof any sort.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nWhat is he that you ask for, niece?\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nMy cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nO! he is returned, and as pleasant as ever he was.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nHe set up his bills here in Messina and challenged Cupid at the\r\nflight; and my uncle’s fool, reading the challenge, subscribed for\r\nCupid, and challenged him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he\r\nkilled and eaten in these wars? But how many hath he killed? for, indeed,\r\nI promised to eat all of his killing.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nFaith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much; but he’ll\r\nbe meet with you, I doubt it not.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nHe hath done good service, lady, in these wars.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nYou had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it; he is a very\r\nvaliant trencher-man; he hath an excellent stomach.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nAnd a good soldier too, lady.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nAnd a good soldier to a lady; but what is he to a lord?\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nA lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with all honourable\r\nvirtues.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nIt is so indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man; but for the\r\nstuffing,—well, we are all mortal.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nYou must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a kind of merry war\r\nbetwixt Signior Benedick and her; they never meet but there’s a\r\nskirmish of wit between them.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nAlas! he gets nothing by that. In our last conflict four of his\r\nfive wits went halting off, and now is the whole man governed with one! so\r\nthat if he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him bear it for a\r\ndifference between himself and his horse; for it is all the wealth that he\r\nhath left to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his companion now? He\r\nhath every month a new sworn brother.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nIs’t possible?\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nVery easily possible: he wears his faith but as the fashion of\r\nhis hat; it ever changes with the next block.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nI see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nNo; and he were, I would burn my study. But I pray you, who is\r\nhis companion? Is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with\r\nhim to the devil?\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nHe is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nO Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he is sooner\r\ncaught than the pestilence, and the taker runs presently mad. God help the\r\nnoble Claudio! If he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a thousand\r\npound ere he be cured.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nI will hold friends with you, lady.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nDo, good friend.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nYou will never run mad, niece.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nNo, not till a hot January.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nDon Pedro is approached.\r\n\r\nEnter Don Pedro, Don John, Claudio, Benedick,\r\nBalthasar and Others.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nGood Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your trouble: the\r\nfashion of the world is to avoid cost, and you encounter it.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nNever came trouble to my house in the likeness of your Grace, for\r\ntrouble being gone, comfort should remain; but when you depart from me,\r\nsorrow abides and happiness takes his leave.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nYou embrace your charge too willingly. I think this is\r\nyour daughter.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nHer mother hath many times told me so.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nWere you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nSignior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nYou have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this what you are,\r\nbeing a man. Truly the lady fathers herself. Be happy, lady, for you are\r\nlike an honourable father.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nIf Signior Leonato be her father, she would not have his head on\r\nher shoulders for all Messina, as like him as she is.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nI wonder that you will still be talking, Signior Benedick:\r\nnobody marks you.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nWhat! my dear Lady Disdain, are you yet living?\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nIs it possible Disdain should die while she hath such meet food\r\nto feed it as Signior Benedick? Courtesy itself must convert to disdain if\r\nyou come in her presence.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nThen is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I am loved of all\r\nladies, only you excepted; and I would I could find in my heart that I had\r\nnot a hard heart; for, truly, I love none.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nA dear happiness to women: they would else have been troubled\r\nwith a pernicious suitor. I thank God and my cold blood, I am of your\r\nhumour for that. I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear\r\nhe loves me.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nGod keep your Ladyship still in that mind; so some gentleman or\r\nother shall scape a predestinate scratched face.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nScratching could not make it worse, and ’twere such a face\r\nas yours were.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nWell, you are a rare parrot-teacher.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nA bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nI would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and so good a\r\ncontinuer. But keep your way, i’ God’s name; I have done.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nYou always end with a jade’s trick: I know you of old.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nThat is the sum of all, Leonato: Signior Claudio, and Signior\r\nBenedick, my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all. I tell him we shall\r\nstay here at the least a month, and he heartly prays some occasion may\r\ndetain us longer: I dare swear he is no hypocrite, but prays from his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nIf you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn. [To\r\nDon John] Let me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled to\r\nthe Prince your brother, I owe you all duty.\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nI thank you: I am not of many words, but I thank you.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nPlease it your Grace lead on?\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nYour hand, Leonato; we will go together.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt all but Benedick and Claudio.]\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nBenedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nI noted her not; but I looked on her.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nIs she not a modest young lady?\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nDo you question me, as an honest man should do, for my simple\r\ntrue judgment; or would you have me speak after my custom, as being a\r\nprofessed tyrant to their sex?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nNo; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nWhy, i’ faith, methinks she’s too low for a high\r\npraise, too brown for a fair praise, and too little for a great praise;\r\nonly this commendation I can afford her, that were she other than she is,\r\nshe were unhandsome, and being no other but as she is, I do not like her.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nThou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me truly how thou\r\nlikest her.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nWould you buy her, that you enquire after her?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nCan the world buy such a jewel?\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nYea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this with a sad\r\nbrow, or do you play the flouting Jack, to tell us Cupid is a good\r\nhare-finder, and Vulcan a rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man\r\ntake you, to go in the song?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nIn mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I looked on.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nI can see yet without spectacles and I see no such matter: there’s\r\nher cousin and she were not possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in\r\nbeauty as the first of May doth the last of December. But I hope you have\r\nno intent to turn husband, have you?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nI would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn to the contrary,\r\nif Hero would be my wife.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nIs’t come to this, in faith? Hath not the world one\r\nman but he will wear his cap with suspicion? Shall I never see a bachelor\r\nof threescore again? Go to, i’ faith; and thou wilt needs thrust thy\r\nneck into a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh away Sundays.\r\n\r\nRe-enter Don Pedro.\r\n\r\nLook! Don Pedro is returned to seek you.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nWhat secret hath held you here, that you followed not to\r\nLeonato’s?\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nI would your Grace would constrain me to tell.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nI charge thee on thy allegiance.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nYou hear, Count Claudio: I can be secret as a dumb man; I would\r\nhave you think so; but on my allegiance mark you this, on my allegiance:\r\nhe is in love. With who? now that is your Grace’s part. Mark how\r\nshort his answer is: with Hero, Leonato’s short daughter.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nIf this were so, so were it uttered.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nLike the old tale, my lord: ‘it is not so, nor\r\n’twas not so; but indeed, God forbid it should be so.’\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nIf my passion change not shortly, God forbid it should be otherwise.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nAmen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nYou speak this to fetch me in, my lord.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nBy my troth, I speak my thought.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nAnd in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nAnd by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nThat I love her, I feel.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nThat she is worthy, I know.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nThat I neither feel how she should be loved, nor know how she\r\nshould be worthy, is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me: I will\r\ndie in it at the stake.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nThou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nAnd never could maintain his part but in the force of his will.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nThat a woman conceived me, I thank her; that she brought me up,\r\nI likewise give her most humble thanks; but that I will have a recheat\r\nwinded in my forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick, all\r\nwomen shall pardon me. Because I will not do them the wrong to mistrust\r\nany, I will do myself the right to trust none; and the fine is,—for the\r\nwhich I may go the finer,—I will live a bachelor.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nI shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nWith anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord; not with\r\nlove: prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get again\r\nwith drinking, pick out mine eyes with a ballad-maker’s pen and hang\r\nme up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of blind Cupid.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nWell, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou wilt prove a\r\nnotable argument.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nIf I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me; and he\r\nthat hits me, let him be clapped on the shoulder and called Adam.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nWell, as time shall try: ‘In time the savage bull\r\ndoth bear the yoke.’\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nThe savage bull may; but if ever the sensible Benedick bear it,\r\npluck off the bull’s horns and set them in my forehead; and let me\r\nbe vilely painted, and in such great letters as they write, ‘Here is\r\ngood horse to hire,’ let them signify under my sign ‘Here you\r\nmay see Benedick the married man.’\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nIf this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nNay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in Venice, thou\r\nwilt quake for this shortly.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nI look for an earthquake too then.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nWell, you will temporize with the hours. In the meantime,\r\ngood Signior Benedick, repair to Leonato’s: commend me to him\r\nand tell him I will not fail him at supper; for indeed he hath made\r\ngreat preparation.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nI have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage; and so\r\nI commit you—\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nTo the tuition of God: from my house, if I had it,—\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nThe sixth of July: your loving friend, Benedick.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nNay, mock not, mock not. The body of your discourse is sometime\r\nguarded with fragments, and the guards are but slightly basted on neither:\r\nere you flout old ends any further, examine your conscience: and so I\r\nleave you.\r\n\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nMy liege, your Highness now may do me good.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nMy love is thine to teach: teach it but how,\r\nAnd thou shalt see how apt it is to learn\r\nAny hard lesson that may do thee good.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nHath Leonato any son, my lord?\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nNo child but Hero; she’s his only heir.\r\nDost thou affect her, Claudio?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nO! my lord,\r\nWhen you went onward on this ended action,\r\nI looked upon her with a soldier’s eye,\r\nThat lik’d, but had a rougher task in hand\r\nThan to drive liking to the name of love;\r\nBut now I am return’d, and that war-thoughts\r\nHave left their places vacant, in their rooms\r\nCome thronging soft and delicate desires,\r\nAll prompting me how fair young Hero is,\r\nSaying, I lik’d her ere I went to wars.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nThou wilt be like a lover presently,\r\nAnd tire the hearer with a book of words.\r\nIf thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,\r\nAnd I will break with her, and with her father,\r\nAnd thou shalt have her. Was’t not to this end\r\nThat thou began’st to twist so fine a story?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nHow sweetly you do minister to love,\r\nThat know love’s grief by his complexion!\r\nBut lest my liking might too sudden seem,\r\nI would have salv’d it with a longer treatise.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nWhat need the bridge much broader than the flood?\r\nThe fairest grant is the necessity.\r\nLook, what will serve is fit: ’tis once, thou lov’st,\r\nAnd I will fit thee with the remedy.\r\nI know we shall have revelling tonight:\r\nI will assume thy part in some disguise,\r\nAnd tell fair Hero I am Claudio;\r\nAnd in her bosom I’ll unclasp my heart,\r\nAnd take her hearing prisoner with the force\r\nAnd strong encounter of my amorous tale:\r\nThen after to her father will I break;\r\nAnd the conclusion is, she shall be thine.\r\nIn practice let us put it presently.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. A room in Leonato’s house.\r\n\r\nEnter Leonato and Antonio,\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nHow now, brother? Where is my cousin your son? Hath he provided\r\nthis music?\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nHe is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell you strange\r\nnews that you yet dreamt not of.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nAre they good?\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nAs the event stamps them: but they have a good cover; they show\r\nwell outward. The Prince and Count Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached\r\nalley in my orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine: the Prince\r\ndiscovered to Claudio that he loved my niece your daughter and meant to\r\nacknowledge it this night in a dance; and if he found her accordant, he\r\nmeant to take the present time by the top and instantly break with you of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\n Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nA good sharp fellow: I will send for him; and question him yourself.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nNo, no; we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself: but I\r\nwill acquaint my daughter withal, that she may be the better prepared for\r\nan answer, if peradventure this be true. Go you and tell her of it.\r\n\r\n[Several persons cross the stage.]\r\n\r\nCousins, you know what you have to do. O! I cry you mercy, friend; go you\r\nwith me, and I will use your skill. Good cousin, have a care this busy\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. Another room in Leonato’s house.\r\n\r\nEnter Don John and Conrade.\r\n\r\nCONRADE.\r\nWhat the good-year, my lord! why are you thus out of measure sad?\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nThere is no measure in the occasion that breeds; therefore the\r\nsadness is without limit.\r\n\r\nCONRADE.\r\nYou should hear reason.\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nAnd when I have heard it, what blessings brings it?\r\n\r\nCONRADE.\r\nIf not a present remedy, at least a patient sufferance.\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nI wonder that thou (being as thou say’st thou art, born\r\nunder Saturn) goest about to apply a moral medicine to a mortifying\r\nmischief. I cannot hide what I am: I must be sad when I have cause, and\r\nsmile at no man’s jests; eat when I have stomach, and wait for no\r\nman’s leisure; sleep when I am drowsy, and tend on no man’s\r\nbusiness; laugh when I am merry, and claw no man in his humour.\r\n\r\nCONRADE.\r\nYea; but you must not make the full show of this till you may do\r\nit without controlment. You have of late stood out against your brother,\r\nand he hath ta’en you newly into his grace; where it is impossible\r\nyou should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself:\r\nit is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest.\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nI had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace;\r\nand it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a\r\ncarriage to rob love from any: in this, though I cannot be said to be a\r\nflattering honest man, it must not be denied but I am a plain-dealing\r\nvillain. I am trusted with a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog;\r\ntherefore I have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my mouth, I\r\nwould bite; if I had my liberty, I would do my liking: in the meantime,\r\nlet me be that I am, and seek not to alter me.\r\n\r\nCONRADE.\r\n Can you make no use of your discontent?\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\n I make all use of it, for I use it only. Who comes here?\r\n\r\nEnter Borachio.\r\n\r\nWhat news, Borachio?\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nI came yonder from a great supper: the Prince your brother is\r\nroyally entertained by Leonato; and I can give you intelligence of an\r\nintended marriage.\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nWill it serve for any model to build mischief on? What is he for\r\na fool that betroths himself to unquietness?\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nMarry, it is your brother’s right hand.\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nWho? the most exquisite Claudio?\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nEven he.\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nA proper squire! And who, and who? which way looks he?\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nMarry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nA very forward March-chick! How came you to this?\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nBeing entertained for a perfumer, as I was smoking a musty room,\r\ncomes me the Prince and Claudio, hand in hand, in sad conference: I whipt\r\nme behind the arras, and there heard it agreed upon that the Prince should\r\nwoo Hero for himself, and having obtained her, give her to Count Claudio.\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nCome, come; let us thither: this may prove food to my\r\ndispleasure. That young start-up hath all the glory of my overthrow: if I\r\ncan cross him any way, I bless myself every way. You are both sure, and\r\nwill assist me?\r\n\r\nCONRADE.\r\n To the death, my lord.\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nLet us to the great supper: their cheer is the greater that I am\r\nsubdued. Would the cook were of my mind! Shall we go to prove what’s\r\nto be done?\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nWe’ll wait upon your Lordship.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\nACT II\r\n\r\nSCENE I. A hall in Leonato’s house.\r\n\nEnter Leonato, Antonio, Hero, Beatrice and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nWas not Count John here at supper?\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nI saw him not.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nHow tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see him but I am\r\nheart-burned an hour after.\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nHe is of a very melancholy disposition.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nHe were an excellent man that were made just in the mid-way\r\nbetween him and Benedick: the one is too like an image, and says nothing;\r\nand the other too like my lady’s eldest son, evermore tattling.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nThen half Signior Benedick’s tongue in Count John’s\r\nmouth, and half Count John’s melancholy in Signior Benedick’s\r\nface—\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nWith a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money enough in his\r\npurse, such a man would win any woman in the world if a’ could get\r\nher good will.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nBy my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a husband, if thou\r\nbe so shrewd of thy tongue.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nIn faith, she’s too curst.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nToo curst is more than curst: I shall lessen God’s sending\r\nthat way; for it is said, ‘God sends a curst cow short horns;’\r\nbut to a cow too curst he sends none.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nSo, by being too curst, God will send you no horns?\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nJust, if he send me no husband; for the which blessing I am at\r\nhim upon my knees every morning and evening. Lord! I could not endure a\r\nhusband with a beard on his face: I had rather lie in the woollen.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nYou may light on a husband that hath no beard.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nWhat should I do with him? dress him in my apparel and make him\r\nmy waiting gentlewoman? He that hath a beard is more than a youth, and he\r\nthat hath no beard is less than a man; and he that is more than a youth is\r\nnot for me; and he that is less than a man, I am not for him: therefore I\r\nwill even take sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his apes\r\ninto hell.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nWell then, go you into hell?\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nNo; but to the gate; and there will the Devil meet me, like an\r\nold cuckold, with horns on his head, and say, ‘Get you to heaven,\r\nBeatrice, get you to heaven; here’s no place for you maids.’ So\r\ndeliver I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter for the heavens: he shows me\r\nwhere the bachelors sit, and there live we as merry as the day is long.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\n[To Hero.] Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled by your father.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nYes, faith; it is my cousin’s duty to make curtsy,\r\nand say, ‘Father, as it please you:’— but yet for all\r\nthat, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else make another\r\ncurtsy, and say, ‘Father, as it please me.’\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nWell, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nNot till God make men of some other metal than earth. Would it\r\nnot grieve a woman to be over-mastered with a piece of valiant dust? to\r\nmake an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl? No, uncle, I’ll\r\nnone: Adam’s sons are my brethren; and truly, I hold it a sin to\r\nmatch in my kindred.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nDaughter, remember what I told you: if the Prince do solicit you\r\nin that kind, you know your answer.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nThe fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be not wooed in\r\ngood time: if the Prince be too important, tell him there is measure in\r\neverything, and so dance out the answer. For, hear me, Hero: wooing,\r\nwedding, and repenting is as a Scotch jig, a measure, and a cinquepace:\r\nthe first suit is hot and hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as\r\nfantastical; the wedding, mannerly modest, as a measure, full of state and\r\nancientry; and then comes Repentance, and with his bad legs, falls into\r\nthe cinquepace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nCousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nI have a good eye, uncle: I can see a church by daylight.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nThe revellers are entering, brother: make good room.\r\n\r\nEnter Don Pedro, Claudio, Benedick, Balthasar, Don\r\nJohn, Borachio, Margaret, Ursula and Others, masked.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nLady, will you walk about with your friend?\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nSo you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing, I am yours for\r\nthe walk; and especially when I walk away.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nWith me in your company?\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nI may say so, when I please.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nAnd when please you to say so?\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nWhen I like your favour; for God defend the lute should be like the case!\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nMy visor is Philemon’s roof; within the house is Jove.\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nWhy, then, your visor should be thatch’d.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nSpeak low, if you speak love.\r\n\r\n[Takes her aside.]\r\n\r\nBALTHASAR.\r\nWell, I would you did like me.\r\n\r\nMARGARET.\r\nSo would not I, for your own sake; for I have many ill qualities.\r\n\r\nBALTHASAR.\r\nWhich is one?\r\n\r\nMARGARET.\r\nI say my prayers aloud.\r\n\r\nBALTHASAR.\r\nI love you the better; the hearers may cry Amen.\r\n\r\nMARGARET.\r\nGod match me with a good dancer!\r\n\r\nBALTHASAR.\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\nMARGARET.\r\nAnd God keep him out of my sight when the dance is done! Answer, clerk.\r\n\r\nBALTHASAR.\r\nNo more words: the clerk is answered.\r\n\r\nURSULA.\r\nI know you well enough: you are Signior Antonio.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nAt a word, I am not.\r\n\r\nURSULA.\r\nI know you by the waggling of your head.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nTo tell you true, I counterfeit him.\r\n\r\nURSULA.\r\nYou could never do him so ill-well, unless you were the very\r\nman. Here’s his dry hand up and down: you are he, you are he.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nAt a word, I am not.\r\n\r\nURSULA.\r\nCome, come; do you think I do not know you by your excellent\r\nwit? Can virtue hide itself? Go to, mum, you are he: graces will\r\nappear, and there’s an end.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nWill you not tell me who told you so?\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nNo, you shall pardon me.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nNor will you not tell me who you are?\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nNot now.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nThat I was disdainful, and that I had my good wit out of\r\nthe ‘Hundred Merry Tales.’ Well, this was Signior\r\nBenedick that said so.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nWhat’s he?\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nI am sure you know him well enough.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nNot I, believe me.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nDid he never make you laugh?\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nI pray you, what is he?\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nWhy, he is the Prince’s jester: a very dull fool; only his\r\ngift is in devising impossible slanders: none but libertines delight in\r\nhim; and the commendation is not in his wit, but in his villainy; for he\r\nboth pleases men and angers them, and then they laugh at him and beat him.\r\nI am sure he is in the fleet: I would he had boarded me!\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nWhen I know the gentleman, I’ll tell him what you say.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nDo, do: he’ll but break a comparison or two on me; which,\r\nperadventure not marked or not laughed at, strikes him into melancholy;\r\nand then there’s a partridge wing saved, for the fool will eat no\r\nsupper that night. [Music within.] We must follow the leaders.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nIn every good thing.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nNay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them at the next turning.\r\n\r\n[Dance. Then exeunt all but Don John, Borachio\r\nand Claudio.]\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nSure my brother is amorous on Hero, and hath withdrawn her\r\nfather to break with him about it. The ladies follow her and but one visor\r\nremains.\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nAnd that is Claudio: I know him by his bearing.\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nAre you not Signior Benedick?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nYou know me well; I am he.\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nSignior, you are very near my brother in his love: he is\r\nenamoured on Hero; I pray you, dissuade him from her; she is no equal for\r\nhis birth: you may do the part of an honest man in it.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nHow know you he loves her?\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nI heard him swear his affection.\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nSo did I too; and he swore he would marry her tonight.\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nCome, let us to the banquet.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt Don John and Borachio.]\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nThus answer I in name of Benedick,\r\nBut hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.\r\n’Tis certain so; the Prince wooss for himself.\r\nFriendship is constant in all other things\r\nSave in the office and affairs of love:\r\nTherefore all hearts in love use their own tongues;\r\nLet every eye negotiate for itself\r\nAnd trust no agent; for beauty is a witch\r\nAgainst whose charms faith melteth into blood.\r\nThis is an accident of hourly proof,\r\nWhich I mistrusted not. Farewell, therefore, Hero!\r\n\r\nRe-enter Benedick.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nCount Claudio?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nYea, the same.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nCome, will you go with me?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nWhither?\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nEven to the next willow, about your own business, Count. What\r\nfashion will you wear the garland of? About your neck, like a usurer’s\r\nchain? or under your arm, like a lieutenant’s scarf? You must wear\r\nit one way, for the Prince hath got your Hero.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nI wish him joy of her.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nWhy, that’s spoken like an honest drovier: so they sell bullocks.\r\nBut did you think the Prince would have served you thus?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nI pray you, leave me.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nHo! now you strike like the blind man: ’twas the boy that\r\nstole your meat, and you’ll beat the post.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nIf it will not be, I’ll leave you.\r\n\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nAlas! poor hurt fowl. Now will he creep into sedges. But, that\r\nmy Lady Beatrice should know me, and not know me! The Prince’s fool!\r\nHa! it may be I go under that title because I am merry. Yea, but so I am\r\napt to do myself wrong; I am not so reputed: it is the base though bitter\r\ndisposition of Beatrice that puts the world into her person, and so gives\r\nme out. Well, I’ll be revenged as I may.\r\n\r\nRe-enter Don Pedro.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nNow, signior, where’s the Count? Did you see him?\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nTroth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame. I found him\r\nhere as melancholy as a lodge in a warren. I told him, and I think I told\r\nhim true, that your Grace had got the good will of this young lady; and I\r\noffered him my company to a willow tree, either to make him a garland, as\r\nbeing forsaken, or to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipped.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nTo be whipped! What’s his fault?\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nThe flat transgression of a school-boy, who, being overjoy’d\r\nwith finding a bird’s nest, shows it his companion, and he steals\r\nit.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nWilt thou make a trust a transgression? The transgression is in the stealer.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nYet it had not been amiss the rod had been made, and the garland\r\ntoo; for the garland he might have worn himself, and the rod he might have\r\nbestowed on you, who, as I take it, have stolen his bird’s nest.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nI will but teach them to sing, and restore them to the owner.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nIf their singing answer your saying, by my faith, you say honestly.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nThe Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you: the gentleman that\r\ndanced with her told her she is much wronged by you.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nO! she misused me past the endurance of a block: an oak but with\r\none green leaf on it would have answered her: my very visor began to\r\nassume life and scold with her. She told me, not thinking I had been\r\nmyself, that I was the Prince’s jester, that I was duller than a\r\ngreat thaw; huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon\r\nme, that I stood like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at me.\r\nShe speaks poniards, and every word stabs: if her breath were as terrible\r\nas her terminations, there were no living near her; she would infect to\r\nthe north star. I would not marry her, though she were endowed with all\r\nthat Adam had left him before he transgressed: she would have made\r\nHercules have turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make the fire\r\ntoo. Come, talk not of her; you shall find her the infernal Ate in good\r\napparel. I would to God some scholar would conjure her, for certainly,\r\nwhile she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary; and\r\npeople sin upon purpose because they would go thither; so indeed, all\r\ndisquiet, horror and perturbation follow her.\r\n\r\nRe-enter Claudio, Beatrice, Hero and Leonato.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nLook! here she comes.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nWill your Grace command me any service to the world’s end?\r\nI will go on the slightest errand now to the Antipodes that you can devise\r\nto send me on; I will fetch you a toothpicker now from the furthest inch\r\nof Asia; bring you the length of Prester John’s foot; fetch you a\r\nhair off the Great Cham’s beard; do you any embassage to the\r\nPygmies, rather than hold three words’ conference with this harpy.\r\nYou have no employment for me?\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nNone, but to desire your good company.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nO God, sir, here’s a dish I love not: I cannot endure my Lady Tongue.\r\n\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nCome, lady, come; you have lost the heart of Signior Benedick.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nIndeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile; and I gave him use for\r\nit, a double heart for a single one: marry, once before he won it of me\r\nwith false dice, therefore your Grace may well say I have lost it.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nYou have put him down, lady, you have put him down.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nSo I would not he should do me, my lord, lest I should prove the\r\nmother of fools. I have brought Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seek.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nWhy, how now, Count! wherefore are you sad?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nNot sad, my lord.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nHow then? Sick?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nNeither, my lord.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nThe Count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor well; but\r\ncivil Count, civil as an orange, and something of that jealous complexion.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nI’ faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true; though, I’ll\r\nbe sworn, if he be so, his conceit is false. Here, Claudio, I have wooed\r\nin thy name, and fair Hero is won; I have broke with her father, and, his\r\ngood will obtained; name the day of marriage, and God give thee joy!\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nCount, take of me my daughter, and with her my fortunes: his\r\nGrace hath made the match, and all grace say Amen to it!\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nSpeak, Count, ’tis your cue.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nSilence is the perfectest herald of joy: I were but little happy,\r\nif I could say how much. Lady, as you are mine, I am yours: I give away\r\nmyself for you and dote upon the exchange.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nSpeak, cousin; or, if you cannot, stop his mouth with a kiss,\r\nand let not him speak neither.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nIn faith, lady, you have a merry heart.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nYea, my lord; I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on the windy\r\nside of care. My cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nAnd so she doth, cousin.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nGood Lord, for alliance! Thus goes everyone to the world but I,\r\nand I am sunburnt. I may sit in a corner and cry heigh-ho for a husband!\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nLady Beatrice, I will get you one.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nI would rather have one of your father’s getting. Hath\r\nyour Grace ne’er a brother like you? Your father got excellent\r\nhusbands, if a maid could come by them.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nWill you have me, lady?\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nNo, my lord, unless I might have another for working days:\r\nyour Grace is too costly to wear every day. But, I beseech your\r\nGrace, pardon me; I was born to speak all mirth and no matter.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nYour silence most offends me, and to be merry best becomes you;\r\nfor out of question, you were born in a merry hour.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nNo, sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then there was a star\r\ndanced, and under that was I born. Cousins, God give you joy!\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nNiece, will you look to those things I told you of?\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nI cry you mercy, uncle. By your Grace’s pardon.\r\n\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nBy my troth, a pleasant spirited lady.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nThere’s little of the melancholy element in her, my lord:\r\nshe is never sad but when she sleeps; and not ever sad then, for I have\r\nheard my daughter say, she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked\r\nherself with laughing.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nShe cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nO! by no means: she mocks all her wooers out of suit.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nShe were an excellent wife for Benedick.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nO Lord! my lord, if they were but a week married, they would talk\r\nthemselves mad.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nCount Claudio, when mean you to go to church?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nTomorrow, my lord. Time goes on crutches till love have all his rites.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nNot till Monday, my dear son, which is hence a just seven-night;\r\nand a time too brief too, to have all things answer my mind.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nCome, you shake the head at so long a breathing; but, I warrant\r\nthee, Claudio, the time shall not go dully by us. I will in the interim\r\nundertake one of Hercules’ labours, which is, to bring Signior\r\nBenedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of affection the one with\r\nthe other. I would fain have it a match; and I doubt not but to fashion\r\nit, if you three will but minister such assistance as I shall give you\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nMy lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten nights’\r\nwatchings.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nAnd I, my lord.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nAnd you too, gentle Hero?\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nI will do any modest office, my lord, to help my cousin to a good\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nAnd Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that I know. Thus\r\nfar can I praise him; he is of a noble strain, of approved valour, and\r\nconfirmed honesty. I will teach you how to humour your cousin, that she\r\nshall fall in love with Benedick; and I, with your two helps, will so\r\npractise on Benedick that, in despite of his quick wit and his queasy\r\nstomach, he shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this, Cupid is\r\nno longer an archer: his glory shall be ours, for we are the only\r\nlove-gods. Go in with me, and I will tell you my drift.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. Another room in Leonato’s house.\r\n\r\nEnter Don John and Borachio.\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nIt is so; the Count Claudio shall marry the daughter of Leonato.\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nYea, my lord; but I can cross it.\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nAny bar, any cross, any impediment will be medicinable to me: I\r\nam sick in displeasure to him, and whatsoever comes athwart his affection\r\nranges evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this marriage?\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nNot honestly, my lord; but so covertly that no dishonesty shall\r\nappear in me.\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nShow me briefly how.\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nI think I told your lordship, a year since, how much I am in the\r\nfavour of Margaret, the waiting gentlewoman to Hero.\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nI remember.\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nI can, at any unseasonable instant of the night, appoint her to\r\nlook out at her lady’s chamber window.\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\n What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nThe poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to the Prince\r\nyour brother; spare not to tell him, that he hath wronged his honour in\r\nmarrying the renowned Claudio,—whose estimation do you mightily hold\r\nup,—to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero.\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nWhat proof shall I make of that?\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nProof enough to misuse the Prince, to vex Claudio, to undo Hero,\r\nand kill Leonato. Look you for any other issue?\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nOnly to despite them, I will endeavour anything.\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nGo then; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count\r\nClaudio alone: tell them that you know that Hero loves me; intend a kind\r\nof zeal both to the Prince and Claudio, as—in love of your brother’s\r\nhonour, who hath made this match, and his friend’s reputation, who\r\nis thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid,—that you have\r\ndiscovered thus. They will scarcely believe this without trial: offer them\r\ninstances, which shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at her\r\nchamber window, hear me call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term me Claudio;\r\nand bring them to see this the very night before the intended wedding: for\r\nin the meantime I will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be absent;\r\nand there shall appear such seeming truth of Hero’s disloyalty, that\r\njealousy shall be called assurance, and all the preparation overthrown.\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nGrow this to what adverse issue it can, I will put it in practice. Be\r\ncunning in the working this, and thy fee is a thousand ducats.\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nBe you constant in the accusation, and my cunning shall not shame me.\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nI will presently go learn their day of marriage.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. Leonato’s Garden.\r\n\r\nEnter Benedick.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nBoy!\r\n\r\nEnter a Boy.\r\n\r\nBOY.\r\nSignior?\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nIn my chamber window lies a book; bring it hither to me in the orchard.\r\n\r\nBOY.\r\nI am here already, sir.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nI know that; but I would have thee hence, and here again.\r\n\r\n[Exit Boy.]\r\n\r\nI do much wonder that one man, seeing how much another man is a fool when\r\nhe dedicates his behaviours to love, will, after he hath laughed at such\r\nshallow follies in others, become the argument of his own scorn by falling\r\nin love: and such a man is Claudio. I have known, when there was no music\r\nwith him but the drum and the fife; and now had he rather hear the tabor\r\nand the pipe: I have known when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see\r\na good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake, carving the fashion\r\nof a new doublet. He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose, like an\r\nhonest man and a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; his words are\r\na very fantastical banquet, just so many strange dishes. May I be so\r\nconverted, and see with these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not\r\nbe sworn but love may transform me to an oyster; but I’ll take my\r\noath on it, till he have made an oyster of me, he shall never make me such\r\na fool. One woman is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am well;\r\nanother virtuous, yet I am well; but till all graces be in one woman, one\r\nwoman shall not come in my grace. Rich she shall be, that’s certain;\r\nwise, or I’ll none; virtuous, or I’ll never cheapen her; fair,\r\nor I’ll never look on her; mild, or come not near me; noble, or not\r\nI for an angel; of good discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair\r\nshall be of what colour it please God. Ha! the Prince and Monsieur Love! I\r\nwill hide me in the arbour.\r\n\r\n[Withdraws.]\r\n\r\nEnter Don Pedro, Leonato and Claudio, followed by Balthasar\r\nand Musicians.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nCome, shall we hear this music?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nYea, my good lord. How still the evening is,\r\nAs hush’d on purpose to grace harmony!\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nSee you where Benedick hath hid himself?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nO! very well, my lord: the music ended,\r\nWe’ll fit the kid-fox with a penny-worth.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nCome, Balthasar, we’ll hear that song again.\r\n\r\nBALTHASAR.\r\nO! good my lord, tax not so bad a voice\r\nTo slander music any more than once.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nIt is the witness still of excellency,\r\nTo put a strange face on his own perfection.\r\nI pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more.\r\n\r\nBALTHASAR.\r\nBecause you talk of wooing, I will sing;\r\nSince many a wooer doth commence his suit\r\nTo her he thinks not worthy; yet he wooes;\r\nYet will he swear he loves.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nNay, pray thee come;\r\nOr if thou wilt hold longer argument,\r\nDo it in notes.\r\n\r\nBALTHASAR.\r\nNote this before my notes;\r\nThere’s not a note of mine that’s worth the noting.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nWhy these are very crotchets that he speaks;\r\nNotes, notes, forsooth, and nothing!\r\n\r\n[Music.]\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nNow, divine air! now is his soul ravished! Is it not strange\r\nthat sheep’s guts should hale souls out of men’s bodies? Well,\r\na horn for my money, when all’s done.\r\n\r\nBALTHASAR [sings.]\r\n Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,\r\n Men were deceivers ever;\r\n One foot in sea, and one on shore,\r\n To one thing constant never.\r\n Then sigh not so, but let them go,\r\n And be you blithe and bonny,\r\n Converting all your sounds of woe\r\nInto Hey nonny, nonny.\r\n\r\n Sing no more ditties, sing no mo\r\nOf dumps so dull and heavy;\r\n The fraud of men was ever so,\r\nSince summer first was leavy.\r\n Then sigh not so, but let them go,\r\nAnd be you blithe and bonny,\r\n Converting all your sounds of woe\r\n Into Hey nonny, nonny.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nBy my troth, a good song.\r\n\r\nBALTHASAR.\r\nAnd an ill singer, my lord.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nHa, no, no, faith; thou singest well enough for a shift.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\n[Aside] And he had been a dog that should have howled\r\nthus, they would have hanged him; and I pray God his bad voice bode no\r\nmischief. I had as lief have heard the night-raven, come what plague could\r\nhave come after it.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO. Yea, marry; dost thou hear, Balthasar? I pray thee, get us\r\nsome excellent music, for tomorrow night we would have it at the\r\nLady Hero’s chamber window.\r\n\r\nBALTHASAR.\r\n The best I can, my lord.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\n Do so: farewell.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt Balthasar and Musicians.]\r\n\r\nCome hither, Leonato: what was it you told me of today, that your niece\r\nBeatrice was in love with Signior Benedick?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nO! ay:—[Aside to Don Pedro] Stalk on, stalk on;\r\nthe fowl sits. I did never think that lady would have loved any man.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nNo, nor I neither; but most wonderful that she should so\r\ndote on Signior Benedick, whom she hath in all outward behaviours\r\nseemed ever to abhor.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\n[Aside] Is’t possible? Sits the wind in that corner?\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nBy my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think of it but that\r\nshe loves him with an enraged affection: it is past the infinite of\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nMaybe she doth but counterfeit.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nFaith, like enough.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nO God! counterfeit! There was never counterfeit of passion came\r\nso near the life of passion as she discovers it.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nWhy, what effects of passion shows she?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\n [Aside] Bait the hook well: this fish will bite.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nWhat effects, my lord? She will sit you; [To Claudio] You\r\nheard my daughter tell you how.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nShe did, indeed.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nHow, how, I pray you? You amaze me: I would have thought her\r\nspirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nI would have sworn it had, my lord; especially against Benedick.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\n[Aside] I should think this a gull, but that the\r\nwhite-bearded fellow speaks it: knavery cannot, sure, hide itself in such\r\nreverence.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\n[Aside] He hath ta’en the infection: hold it\r\nup.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nHath she made her affection known to Benedick?\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nNo; and swears she never will: that’s her torment.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\n’Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says: ‘Shall I,’\r\nsays she, ‘that have so oft encountered him with scorn, write to him\r\nthat I love him?’\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nThis says she now when she is beginning to write to him; for she’ll\r\nbe up twenty times a night, and there will she sit in her smock till she\r\nhave writ a sheet of paper: my daughter tells us all.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nNow you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a pretty jest your\r\ndaughter told us of.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nO! when she had writ it, and was reading it over, she found\r\nBenedick and Beatrice between the sheet?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nThat.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nO! she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence; railed at\r\nherself, that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew\r\nwould flout her: ‘I measure him,’ says she, ‘by my own\r\nspirit; for I should flout him, if he writ to me; yea, though I love him,\r\nI should.’\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nThen down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs, beats her heart,\r\ntears her hair, prays, curses; ‘O sweet Benedick! God give me\r\npatience!’\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nShe doth indeed; my daughter says so; and the ecstasy hath so\r\nmuch overborne her, that my daughter is sometimes afeard she will do a\r\ndesperate outrage to herself. It is very true.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nIt were good that Benedick knew of it by some other, if she\r\nwill not discover it.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nTo what end? he would make but a sport of it and torment the poor\r\nlady worse.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nAnd he should, it were an alms to hang him. She’s an\r\nexcellent sweet lady, and, out of all suspicion, she is virtuous.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nAnd she is exceeding wise.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nIn everything but in loving Benedick.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nO! my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body,\r\nwe have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory. I am sorry for\r\nher, as I have just cause, being her uncle and her guardian.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nI would she had bestowed this dotage on me; I would have daffed\r\nall other respects and made her half myself. I pray you, tell Benedick of\r\nit, and hear what he will say.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nWere it good, think you?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nHero thinks surely she will die; for she says she will die if he\r\nlove her not, and she will die ere she make her love known, and she will\r\ndie if he woo her, rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed\r\ncrossness.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nShe doth well: if she should make tender of her love, ’tis\r\nvery possible he’ll scorn it; for the man,—as you know all,—hath a\r\ncontemptible spirit.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nHe is a very proper man.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nHe hath indeed a good outward happiness.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\n’Fore God, and in my mind, very wise.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nHe doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nAnd I take him to be valiant.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nAs Hector, I assure you: and in the managing of quarrels you\r\nmay say he is wise; for either he avoids them with great discretion, or\r\nundertakes them with a most Christian-like fear.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nIf he do fear God, a’ must necessarily keep peace: if he\r\nbreak the peace, he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nAnd so will he do; for the man doth fear God, howsoever it\r\nseems not in him by some large jests he will make. Well, I am sorry for\r\nyour niece. Shall we go seek Benedick and tell him of her love?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nNever tell him, my lord: let her wear it out with good counsel.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nNay, that’s impossible: she may wear her heart out first.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nWell, we will hear further of it by your daughter: let it cool\r\nthe while. I love Benedick well, and I could wish he would modestly\r\nexamine himself, to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nMy lord, will you walk? dinner is ready.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\n[Aside] If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never\r\ntrust my expectation.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\n[Aside] Let there be the same net spread for her; and\r\nthat must your daughter and her gentlewoman carry. The sport will be,\r\nwhen they hold one an opinion of another’s dotage, and no such\r\nmatter: that’s the scene that I would see, which will be merely a\r\ndumb show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt Don Pedro, Claudio and Leonato.]\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\n[Advancing from the arbour.] This can be no trick: the\r\nconference was sadly borne. They have the truth of this from Hero. They\r\nseem to pity the lady: it seems her affections have their full bent. Love\r\nme? why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured: they say I will\r\nbear myself proudly, if I perceive the love come from her; they say too\r\nthat she will rather die than give any sign of affection. I did never\r\nthink to marry: I must not seem proud: happy are they that hear their\r\ndetractions, and can put them to mending. They say the lady is fair:\r\n’tis a truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous: ’tis so,\r\nI cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving me: by my troth, it is no\r\naddition to her wit, nor no great argument of her folly, for I will be\r\nhorribly in love with her. I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants\r\nof wit broken on me, because I have railed so long against marriage; but\r\ndoth not the appetite alter? A man loves the meat in his youth that he\r\ncannot endure in his age. Shall quips and sentences and these paper\r\nbullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humour? No; the\r\nworld must be peopled. When I said I would die a bachelor, I did not think\r\nI should live till I were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day! she’s\r\na fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in her.\r\n\r\nEnter Beatrice.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nAgainst my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nFair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nI took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to\r\nthank me: if it had been painful, I would not have come.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nYou take pleasure then in the message?\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nYea, just so much as you may take upon a knife’s point,\r\nand choke a daw withal. You have no stomach, signior: fare you well.\r\n\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nHa! ‘Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to\r\ndinner,’ there’s a double meaning in that. ‘I took no\r\nmore pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me,’ that’s\r\nas much as to say, Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks. If\r\nI do not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not love her, I am a\r\nJew. I will go get her picture.\r\n\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\nACT III\r\n\r\nSCENE I. Leonato’s Garden.\r\n\nEnter Hero, Margaret and Ursula.\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nGood Margaret, run thee to the parlour;\r\nThere shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice\r\nProposing with the Prince and Claudio:\r\nWhisper her ear, and tell her, I and Ursala\r\nWalk in the orchard, and our whole discourse\r\nIs all of her; say that thou overheard’st us,\r\nAnd bid her steal into the pleached bower,\r\nWhere honey-suckles, ripen’d by the sun,\r\nForbid the sun to enter; like favourites,\r\nMade proud by princes, that advance their pride\r\nAgainst that power that bred it. There will she hide her,\r\nTo listen our propose. This is thy office;\r\nBear thee well in it and leave us alone.\r\n\r\nMARGARET.\r\nI’ll make her come, I warrant you, presently.\r\n\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nNow, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,\r\nAs we do trace this alley up and down,\r\nOur talk must only be of Benedick:\r\nWhen I do name him, let it be thy part\r\nTo praise him more than ever man did merit.\r\nMy talk to thee must be how Benedick\r\nIs sick in love with Beatrice: of this matter\r\nIs little Cupid’s crafty arrow made,\r\nThat only wounds by hearsay.\r\n\r\nEnter Beatrice behind.\r\n\r\nNow begin;\r\nFor look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs\r\nClose by the ground, to hear our conference.\r\n\r\nURSULA.\r\nThe pleasant’st angling is to see the fish\r\nCut with her golden oars the silver stream,\r\nAnd greedily devour the treacherous bait:\r\nSo angle we for Beatrice; who even now\r\nIs couched in the woodbine coverture.\r\nFear you not my part of the dialogue.\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nThen go we near her, that her ear lose nothing\r\nOf the false sweet bait that we lay for it.\r\n\r\n[They advance to the bower.]\r\n\r\nNo, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful;\r\nI know her spirits are as coy and wild\r\nAs haggards of the rock.\r\n\r\nURSULA.\r\nBut are you sure\r\nThat Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nSo says the Prince, and my new-trothed lord.\r\n\r\nURSULA.\r\nAnd did they bid you tell her of it, madam?\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nThey did entreat me to acquaint her of it;\r\nBut I persuaded them, if they lov’d Benedick,\r\nTo wish him wrestle with affection,\r\nAnd never to let Beatrice know of it.\r\n\r\nURSULA.\r\nWhy did you so? Doth not the gentleman\r\nDeserve as full as fortunate a bed\r\nAs ever Beatrice shall couch upon?\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nO god of love! I know he doth deserve\r\nAs much as may be yielded to a man;\r\nBut Nature never fram’d a woman’s heart\r\nOf prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;\r\nDisdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,\r\nMisprising what they look on, and her wit\r\nValues itself so highly, that to her\r\nAll matter else seems weak. She cannot love,\r\nNor take no shape nor project of affection,\r\nShe is so self-endear’d.\r\n\r\nURSULA.\r\nSure I think so;\r\nAnd therefore certainly it were not good\r\nShe knew his love, lest she make sport at it.\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nWhy, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,\r\nHow wise, how noble, young, how rarely featur’d,\r\nBut she would spell him backward: if fair-fac’d,\r\nShe would swear the gentleman should be her sister;\r\nIf black, why, Nature, drawing of an antick,\r\nMade a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;\r\nIf low, an agate very vilely cut;\r\nIf speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;\r\nIf silent, why, a block moved with none.\r\nSo turns she every man the wrong side out,\r\nAnd never gives to truth and virtue that\r\nWhich simpleness and merit purchaseth.\r\n\r\nURSULA.\r\nSure, sure, such carping is not commendable.\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nNo; not to be so odd, and from all fashions,\r\nAs Beatrice is, cannot be commendable.\r\nBut who dare tell her so? If I should speak,\r\nShe would mock me into air: O! she would laugh me\r\nOut of myself, press me to death with wit.\r\nTherefore let Benedick, like cover’d fire,\r\nConsume away in sighs, waste inwardly:\r\nIt were a better death than die with mocks,\r\nWhich is as bad as die with tickling.\r\n\r\nURSULA.\r\nYet tell her of it: hear what she will say.\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nNo; rather I will go to Benedick,\r\nAnd counsel him to fight against his passion.\r\nAnd, truly, I’ll devise some honest slanders\r\nTo stain my cousin with. One doth not know\r\nHow much an ill word may empoison liking.\r\n\r\nURSULA.\r\nO! do not do your cousin such a wrong.\r\nShe cannot be so much without true judgment,—\r\nHaving so swift and excellent a wit\r\nAs she is priz’d to have,—as to refuse\r\nSo rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nHe is the only man of Italy,\r\nAlways excepted my dear Claudio.\r\n\r\nURSULA.\r\nI pray you, be not angry with me, madam,\r\nSpeaking my fancy: Signior Benedick,\r\nFor shape, for bearing, argument and valour,\r\nGoes foremost in report through Italy.\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nIndeed, he hath an excellent good name.\r\n\r\nURSULA.\r\nHis excellence did earn it, ere he had it.\r\nWhen are you married, madam?\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nWhy, every day, tomorrow. Come, go in:\r\nI’ll show thee some attires, and have thy counsel\r\nWhich is the best to furnish me tomorrow.\r\n\r\nURSULA.\r\nShe’s lim’d, I warrant you,\r\nWe have caught her, madam.\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nIf it prove so, then loving goes by haps:\r\nSome Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt Hero and Ursula.]\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\n[Advancing.] What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true?\r\nStand I condemn’d for pride and scorn so much?\r\nContempt, farewell! and maiden pride, adieu!\r\nNo glory lives behind the back of such.\r\nAnd, Benedick, love on; I will requite thee,\r\nTaming my wild heart to thy loving hand:\r\nIf thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee\r\nTo bind our loves up in a holy band;\r\nFor others say thou dost deserve, and I\r\nBelieve it better than reportingly.\r\n\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. A Room in Leonato’s House.\r\n\r\nEnter Don Pedro, Claudio, Benedick and Leonato.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nI do but stay till your marriage be consummate, and then go I toward Arragon.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nI’ll bring you thither, my lord, if you’ll\r\nvouchsafe me.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nNay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your\r\nmarriage, as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it. I\r\nwill only be bold with Benedick for his company; for, from the crown of\r\nhis head to the sole of his foot, he is all mirth; he hath twice or thrice\r\ncut Cupid’s bowstring, and the little hangman dare not shoot at him.\r\nHe hath a heart as sound as a bell, and his tongue is the clapper; for\r\nwhat his heart thinks, his tongue speaks.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nGallants, I am not as I have been.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nSo say I: methinks you are sadder.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nI hope he be in love.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nHang him, truant! there’s no true drop of blood in him\r\nto be truly touched with love. If he be sad, he wants money.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nI have the tooth-ache.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nDraw it.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nHang it.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nYou must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nWhat! sigh for the tooth-ache?\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nWhere is but a humour or a worm?\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nWell, everyone can master a grief but he that has it.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nYet say I, he is in love.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nThere is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be a fancy\r\nthat he hath to strange disguises; as to be a Dutchman today, a Frenchman\r\ntomorrow; or in the shape of two countries at once, as a German from the\r\nwaist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from the hip upward, no doublet.\r\nUnless he have a fancy to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no\r\nfool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nIf he be not in love with some woman, there is no believing old\r\nsigns: a’ brushes his hat a mornings; what should that bode?\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nHath any man seen him at the barber’s?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nNo, but the barber’s man hath been seen with him; and the\r\nold ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennis balls.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nIndeed he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a beard.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nNay, a’ rubs himself with civet: can you smell him out by that?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nThat’s as much as to say the sweet youth’s in love.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nThe greatest note of it is his melancholy.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nAnd when was he wont to wash his face?\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nYea, or to paint himself? for the which, I hear what they say of him.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nNay, but his jesting spirit; which is now crept into a\r\nlute-string, and now governed by stops.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nIndeed, that tells a heavy tale for him. Conclude, conclude he is in love.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nNay, but I know who loves him.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nThat would I know too: I warrant, one that knows him not.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nYes, and his ill conditions; and in despite of all, dies for him.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nShe shall be buried with her face upwards.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nYet is this no charm for the tooth-ache. Old signior, walk aside\r\nwith me: I have studied eight or nine wise words to speak to you, which\r\nthese hobby-horses must not hear.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt Benedick and Leonato.]\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nFor my life, to break with him about Beatrice.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\n’Tis even so. Hero and Margaret have by this played\r\ntheir parts with Beatrice, and then the two bears will not bite one\r\nanother when they meet.\r\n\r\nEnter Don John.\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nMy lord and brother, God save you!\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nGood den, brother.\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nIf your leisure served, I would speak with you.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nIn private?\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nIf it please you; yet Count Claudio may hear, for what I would\r\nspeak of concerns him.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nWhat’s the matter?\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\n[To Claudio.] Means your lordship to be married tomorrow?\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nYou know he does.\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nI know not that, when he knows what I know.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nIf there be any impediment, I pray you discover it.\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nYou may think I love you not: let that appear hereafter, and aim\r\nbetter at me by that I now will manifest. For my brother, I think he holds\r\nyou well, and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your ensuing\r\nmarriage; surely suit ill-spent and labour ill bestowed!\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nWhy, what’s the matter?\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nI came hither to tell you; and circumstances shortened,—for she\r\nhas been too long a talking of,—the lady is disloyal.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nWho, Hero?\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nEven she: Leonato’s Hero, your Hero, every man’s Hero.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nDisloyal?\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nThe word’s too good to paint out her wickedness; I could\r\nsay, she were worse: think you of a worse title, and I will fit her to it.\r\nWonder not till further warrant: go but with me tonight, you shall see\r\nher chamber window entered, even the night before her wedding-day: if you\r\nlove her then, tomorrow wed her; but it would better fit your honour to\r\nchange your mind.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nMay this be so?\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nI will not think it.\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nIf you dare not trust that you see, confess not that you know.\r\nIf you will follow me, I will show you enough; and when you have seen more\r\nand heard more, proceed accordingly.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nIf I see anything tonight why I should not marry her tomorrow,\r\nin the congregation, where I should wed, there will I shame her.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nAnd, as I wooed for thee to obtain her, I will join with thee\r\nto disgrace her.\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nI will disparage her no farther till you are my witnesses: bear\r\nit coldly but till midnight, and let the issue show itself.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nO day untowardly turned!\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nO mischief strangely thwarting!\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nO plague right well prevented! So will you say when you have seen\r\nthe sequel.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\nScene III. A Street.\r\n\r\nEnter Dogberry and Verges,\r\nwith the Watch.\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nAre you good men and true?\r\n\r\nVERGES.\r\nYea, or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation, body and soul.\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nNay, that were a punishment too good for them, if they should\r\nhave any allegiance in them, being chosen for the Prince’s watch.\r\n\r\nVERGES.\r\nWell, give them their charge, neighbour Dogberry.\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nFirst, who think you the most desartless man to be constable?\r\n\r\nFIRST WATCH.\r\nHugh Oatcake, sir, or George Seacoal; for they can write and read.\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nCome hither, neighbour Seacoal. God hath blessed you with a good\r\nname: to be a well-favoured man is the gift of Fortune; but to write and\r\nread comes by Nature.\r\n\r\nSECOND WATCH.\r\nBoth which, Master Constable,—\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nYou have: I knew it would be your answer. Well, for your favour,\r\nsir, why, give God thanks, and make no boast of it; and for your writing\r\nand reading, let that appear when there is no need of such vanity. You are\r\nthought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the\r\nwatch; therefore bear you the lanthorn. This is your charge: you shall\r\ncomprehend all vagrom men; you are to bid any man stand, in the Prince’s\r\nname.\r\n\r\nSECOND WATCH.\r\nHow, if a’ will not stand?\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nWhy, then, take no note of him, but let him go; and presently\r\ncall the rest of the watch together, and thank God you are rid of a knave.\r\n\r\nVERGES.\r\nIf he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none of the Prince’s\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nTrue, and they are to meddle with none but the Prince’s\r\nsubjects. You shall also make no noise in the streets: for, for the\r\nwatch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.\r\n\r\nSECOND WATCH.\r\nWe will rather sleep than talk: we know what belongs to a watch.\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nWhy, you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman, for I\r\ncannot see how sleeping should offend; only have a care that your bills be\r\nnot stolen. Well, you are to call at all the alehouses, and bid those that\r\nare drunk get them to bed.\r\n\r\nSECOND WATCH.\r\nHow if they will not?\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nWhy then, let them alone till they are sober: if they make you\r\nnot then the better answer, you may say they are not the men you took them\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nSECOND WATCH.\r\nWell, sir.\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nIf you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue of your\r\noffice, to be no true man; and, for such kind of men, the less you meddle\r\nor make with them, why, the more is for your honesty.\r\n\r\nSECOND WATCH.\r\nIf we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay hands on him?\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nTruly, by your office, you may; but I think they that touch\r\npitch will be defiled. The most peaceable way for you, if you do take a\r\nthief, is to let him show himself what he is and steal out of your\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nVERGES.\r\nYou have been always called a merciful man, partner.\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nTruly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more a man who\r\nhath any honesty in him.\r\n\r\nVERGES.\r\nIf you hear a child cry in the night, you must call to the nurse\r\nand bid her still it.\r\n\r\nSECOND WATCH.\r\nHow if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nWhy then, depart in peace, and let the child wake her with\r\ncrying; for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baes, will never\r\nanswer a calf when he bleats.\r\n\r\nVERGES.\r\n’Tis very true.\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nThis is the end of the charge. You constable, are to present the\r\nPrince’s own person: if you meet the Prince in the night, you may\r\nstay him.\r\n\r\nVERGES.\r\nNay, by’r lady, that I think, a’ cannot.\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nFive shillings to one on’t, with any man that knows the\r\nstatutes, he may stay him: marry, not without the Prince be willing; for,\r\nindeed, the watch ought to offend no man, and it is an offence to stay a\r\nman against his will.\r\n\r\nVERGES.\r\nBy’r lady, I think it be so.\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nHa, ah, ha! Well, masters, good night: an there be any matter of\r\nweight chances, call up me: keep your fellows’ counsels and your\r\nown, and good night. Come, neighbour.\r\n\r\nSECOND WATCH.\r\nWell, masters, we hear our charge: let us go sit here upon\r\nthe church bench till two, and then all to bed.\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nOne word more, honest neighbours. I pray you, watch about\r\nSignior Leonato’s door; for the wedding being there tomorrow,\r\nthere is a great coil tonight. Adieu; be vigitant, I beseech\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt Dogberry and Verges.]\r\n\r\nEnter Borachio and Conrade.\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nWhat, Conrade!\r\n\r\nWATCH.\r\n[Aside] Peace! stir not.\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nConrade, I say!\r\n\r\nCONRADE.\r\nHere, man. I am at thy elbow.\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nMass, and my elbow itched; I thought there would a scab follow.\r\n\r\nCONRADE.\r\nI will owe thee an answer for that; and now forward with thy tale.\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nStand thee close then under this penthouse, for it drizzles\r\nrain, and I will, like a true drunkard, utter all to thee.\r\n\r\nWATCH.\r\n[Aside] Some treason, masters; yet stand close.\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nTherefore know, I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats.\r\n\r\nCONRADE.\r\nIs it possible that any villainy should be so dear?\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nThou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villainy should\r\nbe so rich; for when rich villains have need of poor ones, poor ones may\r\nmake what price they will.\r\n\r\nCONRADE.\r\nI wonder at it.\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nThat shows thou art unconfirmed. Thou knowest that the fashion\r\nof a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is nothing to a man.\r\n\r\nCONRADE.\r\nYes, it is apparel.\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nI mean, the fashion.\r\n\r\nCONRADE.\r\nYes, the fashion is the fashion.\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nTush! I may as well say the fool’s the fool. But seest\r\nthou not what a deformed thief this fashion is?\r\n\r\nWATCH.\r\n[Aside] I know that Deformed; a’ has been a vile thief\r\nthis seven years; a’ goes up and down like a gentleman: I remember\r\nhis name.\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nDidst thou not hear somebody?\r\n\r\nCONRADE.\r\nNo: ’twas the vane on the house.\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nSeest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this fashion is?\r\nhow giddily he turns about all the hot bloods between fourteen and\r\nfive-and-thirty? sometime fashioning them like Pharaoh’s soldiers in\r\nthe reechy painting; sometime like god Bel’s priests in the old\r\nchurch window; sometime like the shaven Hercules in the smirched\r\nworm-eaten tapestry, where his codpiece seems as massy as his club?\r\n\r\nCONRADE.\r\nAll this I see, and I see that the fashion wears out more apparel\r\nthan the man. But art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too, that\r\nthou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nNot so neither; but know, that I have tonight wooed Margaret,\r\nthe Lady Hero’s gentlewoman, by the name of Hero: she leans me out\r\nat her mistress’ chamber window, bids me a thousand times good\r\nnight,—I tell this tale vilely:—I should first tell thee how the Prince,\r\nClaudio, and my master, planted and placed and possessed by my master Don\r\nJohn, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter.\r\n\r\nCONRADE.\r\nAnd thought they Margaret was Hero?\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nTwo of them did, the Prince and Claudio; but the devil my\r\nmaster, knew she was Margaret; and partly by his oaths, which first\r\npossessed them, partly by the dark night, which did deceive them, but\r\nchiefly by my villainy, which did confirm any slander that Don John had\r\nmade, away went Claudio enraged; swore he would meet her, as he was\r\nappointed, next morning at the temple, and there, before the whole\r\ncongregation, shame her with what he saw o’er night, and send her\r\nhome again without a husband.\r\n\r\nFIRST WATCH.\r\nWe charge you in the Prince’s name, stand!\r\n\r\nSECOND WATCH.\r\nCall up the right Master Constable. We have here recovered\r\nthe most dangerous piece of lechery that ever was known in the\r\ncommonwealth.\r\n\r\nFIRST WATCH.\r\nAnd one Deformed is one of them: I know him, a’ wears a lock.\r\n\r\nCONRADE.\r\nMasters, masters!\r\n\r\nSECOND WATCH.\r\nYou’ll be made bring Deformed forth, I warrant you.\r\n\r\nCONRADE.\r\nMasters,—\r\n\r\nFIRST WATCH.\r\nNever speak: we charge you let us obey you to go with us.\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nWe are like to prove a goodly commodity, being taken up of these\r\nmen’s bills.\r\n\r\nCONRADE.\r\nA commodity in question, I warrant you. Come, we’ll obey you.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\nScene IV. A Room in Leonato’s House.\r\n\r\nEnter Hero, Margaret and Ursula.\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nGood Ursula, wake my cousin Beatrice, and desire her to rise.\r\n\r\nURSULA.\r\nI will, lady.\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nAnd bid her come hither.\r\n\r\nURSULA.\r\nWell.\r\n\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nMARGARET.\r\nTroth, I think your other rebato were better.\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nNo, pray thee, good Meg, I’ll wear this.\r\n\r\nMARGARET.\r\nBy my troth’s not so good; and I warrant your cousin will say so.\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nMy cousin’s a fool, and thou art another: I’ll\r\nwear none but this.\r\n\r\nMARGARET.\r\nI like the new tire within excellently, if the hair were a thought\r\nbrowner; and your gown’s a most rare fashion, i’ faith. I saw the\r\nDuchess of Milan’s gown that they praise so.\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nO! that exceeds, they say.\r\n\r\nMARGARET.\r\nBy my troth ’s but a night-gown in respect of yours: cloth o’ gold, and\r\ncuts, and laced with silver, set with pearls, down sleeves, side\r\nsleeves, and skirts round, underborne with a bluish tinsel; but for a\r\nfine, quaint, graceful, and excellent fashion, yours is worth ten on’t.\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nGod give me joy to wear it! for my heart is exceeding heavy.\r\n\r\nMARGARET.\r\n’Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man.\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nFie upon thee! art not ashamed?\r\n\r\nMARGARET.\r\nOf what, lady? of speaking honourably? Is not marriage honourable in a\r\nbeggar? Is not your lord honourable without marriage? I think you would\r\nhave me say, saving your reverence, ‘a husband:’ an bad thinking do not\r\nwrest true speaking, I’ll offend nobody. Is there any harm in ‘the\r\nheavier for a husband’? None, I think, and it be the right husband and\r\nthe right wife; otherwise ’tis light, and not heavy: ask my Lady\r\nBeatrice else; here she comes.\r\n\r\nEnter Beatrice.\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nGood morrow, coz.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nGood morrow, sweet Hero.\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nWhy, how now? do you speak in the sick tune?\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nI am out of all other tune, methinks.\r\n\r\nMARGARET.\r\nClap’s into ‘Light o’ love’; that goes\r\nwithout a burden: do you sing it, and I’ll dance it.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nYe, light o’ love with your heels! then, if your husband\r\nhave stables enough, you’ll see he shall lack no barnes.\r\n\r\nMARGARET.\r\nO illegitimate construction! I scorn that with my heels.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\n’Tis almost five o’clock, cousin; ’tis time\r\nyou were ready. By my troth, I am exceeding ill. Heigh-ho!\r\n\r\nMARGARET.\r\nFor a hawk, a horse, or a husband?\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nFor the letter that begins them all, H.\r\n\r\nMARGARET.\r\nWell, and you be not turned Turk, there’s no more\r\nsailing by the star.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nWhat means the fool, trow?\r\n\r\nMARGARET.\r\nNothing I; but God send everyone their heart’s desire!\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nThese gloves the Count sent me; they are an excellent perfume.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nI am stuffed, cousin, I cannot smell.\r\n\r\nMARGARET.\r\nA maid, and stuffed! there’s goodly catching of cold.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nO, God help me! God help me! how long have you professed\r\napprehension?\r\n\r\nMARGARET.\r\nEver since you left it. Doth not my wit become me rarely!\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nIt is not seen enough, you should wear it in your cap. By\r\nmy troth, I am sick.\r\n\r\nMARGARET.\r\nGet you some of this distilled Carduus benedictus, and lay it to\r\nyour heart: it is the only thing for a qualm.\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nThere thou prick’st her with a thistle.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nBenedictus! why benedictus? you have some moral in this\r\nbenedictus.\r\n\r\nMARGARET.\r\nMoral! no, by my troth, I have no moral meaning; I meant, plain\r\nholy thistle. You may think, perchance, that I think you are in love: nay,\r\nby’r Lady, I am not such a fool to think what I list; nor I list not\r\nto think what I can; nor, indeed, I cannot think, if I would think my\r\nheart out of thinking, that you are in love, or that you will be in love,\r\nor that you can be in love. Yet Benedick was such another, and now is he\r\nbecome a man: he swore he would never marry; and yet now, in despite of\r\nhis heart, he eats his meat without grudging: and how you may be\r\nconverted, I know not; but methinks you look with your eyes as other women\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nWhat pace is this that thy tongue keeps?\r\n\r\nMARGARET.\r\nNot a false gallop.\r\n\r\nRe-enter Ursula.\r\n\r\nURSULA.\r\nMadam, withdraw: the Prince, the Count, Signior Benedick, Don\r\nJohn, and all the gallants of the town are come to fetch you to church.\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nHelp to dress me, good coz, good Meg, good Ursula.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\nScene V.

An honest soul, i’\r\nfaith, sir; by my troth he is, as ever broke bread; but God is to be\r\nworshipped: all men are not alike; alas! good neighbour.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nIndeed, neighbour, he comes too short of you.\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nGifts that God gives.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nI must leave you.\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nOne word, sir: our watch, sir, have indeed comprehended two\r\naspicious persons, and we would have them this morning examined before\r\nyour worship.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nTake their examination yourself, and bring it me: I am now in\r\ngreat haste, as may appear unto you.\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nIt shall be suffigance.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nDrink some wine ere you go: fare you well.\r\n\r\nEnter a Messenger.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nMy lord, they stay for you to give your daughter to her husband.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nI’ll wait upon them: I am ready.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt Leonato and Messenger.]\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nGo, good partner, go get you to Francis Seacoal; bid him bring\r\nhis pen and inkhorn to the gaol: we are now to examination these men.\r\n\r\nVERGES.\r\nAnd we must do it wisely.\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nWe will spare for no wit, I warrant you; here’s that shall\r\ndrive some of them to a non-come: only get the learned writer to set down\r\nour excommunication, and meet me at the gaol.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\nACT IV\r\n\r\nSCENE I.

Interjections? Why then, some be of laughing, as ah!\r\nha! he!\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nStand thee by, Friar. Father, by your leave:\r\nWill you with free and unconstrained soul\r\nGive me this maid, your daughter?\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nAs freely, son, as God did give her me.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nAnd what have I to give you back whose worth\r\nMay counterpoise this rich and precious gift?\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nNothing, unless you render her again.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nSweet Prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.\r\nThere, Leonato, take her back again:\r\nGive not this rotten orange to your friend;\r\nShe’s but the sign and semblance of her honour.\r\nBehold! how like a maid she blushes here.\r\nO! what authority and show of truth\r\nCan cunning sin cover itself withal.\r\nComes not that blood as modest evidence\r\nTo witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,\r\nAll you that see her, that she were a maid,\r\nBy these exterior shows? But she is none:\r\nShe knows the heat of a luxurious bed;\r\nHer blush is guiltiness, not modesty.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nWhat do you mean, my lord?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nNot to be married,\r\nNot to knit my soul to an approved wanton.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nDear my lord, if you, in your own proof,\r\nHave vanquish’d the resistance of her youth,\r\nAnd made defeat of her virginity,—\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nI know what you would say: if I have known her,\r\nYou will say she did embrace me as a husband,\r\nAnd so extenuate the forehand sin: No, Leonato,\r\nI never tempted her with word too large;\r\nBut as a brother to his sister show’d\r\nBashful sincerity and comely love.\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nAnd seem’d I ever otherwise to you?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nOut on thee! Seeming! I will write against it:\r\nYou seem to me as Dian in her orb,\r\nAs chaste as is the bud ere it be blown;\r\nBut you are more intemperate in your blood\r\nThan Venus, or those pamper’d animals\r\nThat rage in savage sensuality.\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nIs my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nSweet Prince, why speak not you?\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nWhat should I speak?\r\nI stand dishonour’d, that have gone about\r\nTo link my dear friend to a common stale.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nAre these things spoken, or do I but dream?\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nSir, they are spoken, and these things are true.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nThis looks not like a nuptial.\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nTrue! O God!\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nLeonato, stand I here?\r\nIs this the Prince? Is this the Prince’s brother?\r\nIs this face Hero’s? Are our eyes our own?\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nAll this is so; but what of this, my lord?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nLet me but move one question to your daughter,\r\nAnd by that fatherly and kindly power\r\nThat you have in her, bid her answer truly.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nI charge thee do so, as thou art my child.\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nO, God defend me! how am I beset!\r\nWhat kind of catechizing call you this?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nTo make you answer truly to your name.\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nIs it not Hero? Who can blot that name\r\nWith any just reproach?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nMarry, that can Hero:\r\nHero itself can blot out Hero’s virtue.\r\nWhat man was he talk’d with you yesternight\r\nOut at your window, betwixt twelve and one?\r\nNow, if you are a maid, answer to this.\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nI talk’d with no man at that hour, my lord.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nWhy, then are you no maiden.\r\nLeonato, I am sorry you must hear: upon my honour,\r\nMyself, my brother, and this grieved Count,\r\nDid see her, hear her, at that hour last night,\r\nTalk with a ruffian at her chamber window;\r\nWho hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,\r\nConfess’d the vile encounters they have had\r\nA thousand times in secret.\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nFie, fie! they are not to be nam’d, my lord,\r\nNot to be spoke of;\r\nThere is not chastity enough in language\r\nWithout offence to utter them. Thus, pretty lady,\r\nI am sorry for thy much misgovernment.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nO Hero! what a Hero hadst thou been,\r\nIf half thy outward graces had been plac’d\r\nAbout thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!\r\nBut fare thee well, most foul, most fair! farewell,\r\nThou pure impiety, and impious purity!\r\nFor thee I’ll lock up all the gates of love,\r\nAnd on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,\r\nTo turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,\r\nAnd never shall it more be gracious.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nHath no man’s dagger here a point for me?\r\n\r\n[Hero swoons.]\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nWhy, how now, cousin! wherefore sink you down?\r\n\r\nDON JOHN.\r\nCome, let us go. These things, come thus to light,\r\nSmother her spirits up.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt Don Pedro, Don John and Claudio.]\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nHow doth the lady?\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nDead, I think! Help, uncle! Hero! why, Hero! Uncle! Signior\r\nBenedick! Friar!\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nO Fate! take not away thy heavy hand:\r\nDeath is the fairest cover for her shame\r\nThat may be wish’d for.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nHow now, cousin Hero?\r\n\r\nFRIAR.\r\nHave comfort, lady.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nDost thou look up?\r\n\r\nFRIAR.\r\nYea; wherefore should she not?\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nWherefore! Why, doth not every earthly thing\r\nCry shame upon her? Could she here deny\r\nThe story that is printed in her blood?\r\nDo not live, Hero; do not ope thine eyes;\r\nFor, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,\r\nThought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,\r\nMyself would, on the rearward of reproaches,\r\nStrike at thy life. Griev’d I, I had but one?\r\nChid I for that at frugal Nature’s frame?\r\nO! one too much by thee. Why had I one?\r\nWhy ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?\r\nWhy had I not with charitable hand\r\nTook up a beggar’s issue at my gates,\r\nWho smirched thus, and mir’d with infamy,\r\nI might have said, ‘No part of it is mine;\r\nThis shame derives itself from unknown loins?’\r\nBut mine, and mine I lov’d, and mine I prais’d,\r\nAnd mine that I was proud on, mine so much\r\nThat I myself was to myself not mine,\r\nValuing of her; why, she—O! she is fallen\r\nInto a pit of ink, that the wide sea\r\nHath drops too few to wash her clean again,\r\nAnd salt too little which may season give\r\nTo her foul tainted flesh.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nSir, sir, be patient.\r\nFor my part, I am so attir’d in wonder,\r\nI know not what to say.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nO! on my soul, my cousin is belied!\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nLady, were you her bedfellow last night?\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nNo, truly, not; although, until last night,\r\nI have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nConfirm’d, confirm’d! O! that is stronger made,\r\nWhich was before barr’d up with ribs of iron.\r\nWould the two princes lie? and Claudio lie,\r\nWho lov’d her so, that, speaking of her foulness,\r\nWash’d it with tears? Hence from her! let her die.\r\n\r\nFRIAR.\r\nHear me a little;\r\nFor I have only been silent so long,\r\nAnd given way unto this course of fortune,\r\nBy noting of the lady: I have mark’d\r\nA thousand blushing apparitions\r\nTo start into her face; a thousand innocent shames\r\nIn angel whiteness bear away those blushes;\r\nAnd in her eye there hath appear’d a fire,\r\nTo burn the errors that these princes hold\r\nAgainst her maiden truth. Call me a fool;\r\nTrust not my reading nor my observations,\r\nWhich with experimental seal doth warrant\r\nThe tenure of my book; trust not my age,\r\nMy reverence, calling, nor divinity,\r\nIf this sweet lady lie not guiltless here\r\nUnder some biting error.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nFriar, it cannot be.\r\nThou seest that all the grace that she hath left\r\nIs that she will not add to her damnation\r\nA sin of perjury: she not denies it.\r\nWhy seek’st thou then to cover with excuse\r\nThat which appears in proper nakedness?\r\n\r\nFRIAR.\r\nLady, what man is he you are accus’d of?\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nThey know that do accuse me, I know none;\r\nIf I know more of any man alive\r\nThan that which maiden modesty doth warrant,\r\nLet all my sins lack mercy! O, my father!\r\nProve you that any man with me convers’d\r\nAt hours unmeet, or that I yesternight\r\nMaintain’d the change of words with any creature,\r\nRefuse me, hate me, torture me to death.\r\n\r\nFRIAR.\r\nThere is some strange misprision in the princes.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nTwo of them have the very bent of honour;\r\nAnd if their wisdoms be misled in this,\r\nThe practice of it lives in John the bastard,\r\nWhose spirits toil in frame of villainies.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nI know not. If they speak but truth of her,\r\nThese hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honour,\r\nThe proudest of them shall well hear of it.\r\nTime hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,\r\nNor age so eat up my invention,\r\nNor fortune made such havoc of my means,\r\nNor my bad life reft me so much of friends,\r\nBut they shall find, awak’d in such a kind,\r\nBoth strength of limb and policy of mind,\r\nAbility in means and choice of friends,\r\nTo quit me of them throughly.\r\n\r\nFRIAR.\r\nPause awhile,\r\nAnd let my counsel sway you in this case.\r\nYour daughter here the princes left for dead;\r\nLet her awhile be secretly kept in,\r\nAnd publish it that she is dead indeed:\r\nMaintain a mourning ostentation;\r\nAnd on your family’s old monument\r\nHang mournful epitaphs and do all rites\r\nThat appertain unto a burial.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nWhat shall become of this? What will this do?\r\n\r\nFRIAR.\r\nMarry, this well carried shall on her behalf\r\nChange slander to remorse; that is some good.\r\nBut not for that dream I on this strange course,\r\nBut on this travail look for greater birth.\r\nShe dying, as it must be so maintain’d,\r\nUpon the instant that she was accus’d,\r\nShall be lamented, pitied and excus’d\r\nOf every hearer; for it so falls out\r\nThat what we have we prize not to the worth\r\nWhiles we enjoy it, but being lack’d and lost,\r\nWhy, then we rack the value, then we find\r\nThe virtue that possession would not show us\r\nWhiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:\r\nWhen he shall hear she died upon his words,\r\nThe idea of her life shall sweetly creep\r\nInto his study of imagination,\r\nAnd every lovely organ of her life\r\nShall come apparell’d in more precious habit,\r\nMore moving, delicate, and full of life\r\nInto the eye and prospect of his soul,\r\nThan when she liv’d indeed: then shall he mourn,—\r\nIf ever love had interest in his liver,—\r\nAnd wish he had not so accused her,\r\nNo, though he thought his accusation true.\r\nLet this be so, and doubt not but success\r\nWill fashion the event in better shape\r\nThan I can lay it down in likelihood.\r\nBut if all aim but this be levell’d false,\r\nThe supposition of the lady’s death\r\nWill quench the wonder of her infamy:\r\nAnd if it sort not well, you may conceal her,—\r\nAs best befits her wounded reputation,—\r\nIn some reclusive and religious life,\r\nOut of all eyes, tongues, minds, and injuries.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nSignior Leonato, let the friar advise you:\r\nAnd though you know my inwardness and love\r\nIs very much unto the Prince and Claudio,\r\nYet, by mine honour, I will deal in this\r\nAs secretly and justly as your soul\r\nShould with your body.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nBeing that I flow in grief,\r\nThe smallest twine may lead me.\r\n\r\nFRIAR.\r\n’Tis well consented: presently away;\r\nFor to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.\r\nCome, lady, die to live: this wedding day\r\nPerhaps is but prolong’d: have patience and endure.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt Friar, Hero and Leonato.]\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nLady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nYea, and I will weep a while longer.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nI will not desire that.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nYou have no reason; I do it freely.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nSurely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nAh! how much might the man deserve of me that would right her.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nIs there any way to show such friendship?\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nA very even way, but no such friend.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nMay a man do it?\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nIt is a man’s office, but not yours.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nI do love nothing in the world so well as you: is not that strange?\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nAs strange as the thing I know not. It were as possible for\r\nme to say I loved nothing so well as you; but believe me not, and yet\r\nI lie not; I confess nothing, nor I deny nothing. I am sorry for my\r\ncousin.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nBy my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nDo not swear by it, and eat it.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nI will swear by it that you love me; and I will make him eat it\r\nthat says I love not you.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nWill you not eat your word?\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nWith no sauce that can be devised to it. I protest I love thee.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nWhy then, God forgive me!\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nWhat offence, sweet Beatrice?\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nYou have stayed me in a happy hour: I was about to protest I loved you.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nAnd do it with all thy heart.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nI love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nCome, bid me do anything for thee.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nKill Claudio.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nHa! not for the wide world.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nYou kill me to deny it. Farewell.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nTarry, sweet Beatrice.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nI am gone, though I am here: there is no love in you: nay, I\r\npray you, let me go.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nBeatrice,—\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nIn faith, I will go.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nWe’ll be friends first.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nYou dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nIs Claudio thine enemy?\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nIs he not approved in the height a villain, that hath slandered,\r\nscorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? O! that I were a man. What! bear her in\r\nhand until they come to take hands, and then, with public accusation,\r\nuncovered slander, unmitigated rancour,—O God, that I were a man! I would\r\neat his heart in the market-place.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nHear me, Beatrice,—\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nTalk with a man out at a window! a proper saying!\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nNay, but Beatrice,—\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nSweet Hero! she is wronged, she is slandered, she is undone.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nBeat—\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nPrinces and Counties! Surely, a princely testimony, a goodly\r\nCount Comfect; a sweet gallant, surely! O! that I were a man for his sake,\r\nor that I had any friend would be a man for my sake! But manhood is melted\r\ninto curtsies, valour into compliment, and men are only turned into tongue,\r\nand trim ones too: he is now as valiant as Hercules, that only tells a lie\r\nand swears it. I cannot be a man with wishing, therefore I will die a\r\nwoman with grieving.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nTarry, good Beatrice. By this hand, I love thee.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nUse it for my love some other way than swearing by it.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nThink you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero?\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nYea, as sure is I have a thought or a soul.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nEnough! I am engaged, I will challenge him. I will kiss your\r\nhand, and so leave you. By this hand, Claudio shall render me a dear\r\naccount. As you hear of me, so think of me. Go, comfort your cousin: I\r\nmust say she is dead; and so, farewell.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\nScene II.

What is your name, friend?\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nBorachio.\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nPray write down Borachio. Yours, sirrah?\r\n\r\nCONRADE.\r\nI am a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade.\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nWrite down Master gentleman Conrade. Masters, do you serve God?\r\n\r\nBOTH.\r\nYea, sir, we hope.\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nWrite down that they hope they serve God: and write God first;\r\nfor God defend but God should go before such villains! Masters, it is\r\nproved already that you are little better than false knaves, and it will\r\ngo near to be thought so shortly. How answer you for yourselves?\r\n\r\nCONRADE.\r\nMarry, sir, we say we are none.\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nA marvellous witty fellow, I assure you; but I will go\r\nabout with him. Come you hither, sirrah; a word in your ear: sir, I\r\nsay to you, it is thought you are false knaves.\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nSir, I say to you we are none.\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nWell, stand aside. Fore God, they are both in a tale. Have you\r\nwrit down, that they are none?\r\n\r\nSEXTON.\r\nMaster Constable, you go not the way to examine: you must call\r\nforth the watch that are their accusers.\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nYea, marry, that’s the eftest way. Let the watch come forth.\r\nMasters, I charge you, in the Prince’s name, accuse these men.\r\n\r\nFIRST WATCH.\r\nThis man said, sir, that Don John, the Prince’s\r\nbrother, was a villain.\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nWrite down Prince John a villain. Why, this is flat perjury, to\r\ncall a Prince’s brother villain.\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nMaster Constable,—\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nPray thee, fellow, peace: I do not like thy look, I promise thee.\r\n\r\nSEXTON.\r\nWhat heard you him say else?\r\n\r\nSECOND WATCH.\r\nMarry, that he had received a thousand ducats of Don John\r\nfor accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully.\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nFlat burglary as ever was committed.\r\n\r\nVERGES.\r\nYea, by the mass, that it is.\r\n\r\nSEXTON.\r\nWhat else, fellow?\r\n\r\nFIRST WATCH.\r\nAnd that Count Claudio did mean, upon his words, to disgrace\r\nHero before the whole assembly, and not marry her.\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nO villain! thou wilt be condemned into everlasting redemption\r\nfor this.\r\n\r\nSEXTON.\r\nWhat else?\r\n\r\nSECOND WATCH.\r\nThis is all.\r\n\r\nSEXTON.\r\nAnd this is more, masters, than you can deny. Prince John is this\r\nmorning secretly stolen away: Hero was in this manner accused, in this\r\nmanner refused, and, upon the grief of this, suddenly died. Master\r\nConstable, let these men be bound, and brought to Leonato’s: I will\r\ngo before and show him their examination.\r\n\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nCome, let them be opinioned.\r\n\r\nVERGES.\r\nLet them be in the hands—\r\n\r\nCONRADE.\r\nOff, coxcomb!\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nGod’s my life! where’s the sexton? let him write\r\ndown the Prince’s officer coxcomb. Come, bind them. Thou naughty\r\nvarlet!\r\n\r\nCONRADE.\r\nAway! you are an ass; you are an ass.\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nDost thou not suspect my place? Dost thou not suspect my years?\r\nO that he were here to write me down an ass! but, masters, remember that I\r\nam an ass; though it be not written down, yet forget not that I am an ass.\r\nNo, thou villain, thou art full of piety, as shall be proved upon thee by\r\ngood witness. I am a wise fellow; and, which is more, an officer; and,\r\nwhich is more, a householder; and, which is more, as pretty a piece of\r\nflesh as any in Messina; and one that knows the law, go to; and a rich\r\nfellow enough, go to; and a fellow that hath had losses; and one that hath\r\ntwo gowns, and everything handsome about him. Bring him away. O that I had\r\nbeen writ down an ass!\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\nACT V\r\n\r\nSCENE I. Before Leonato’s House.\r\n\nEnter Leonato and Antonio.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nIf you go on thus, you will kill yourself\r\nAnd ’tis not wisdom thus to second grief\r\nAgainst yourself.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nI pray thee, cease thy counsel,\r\nWhich falls into mine ears as profitless\r\nAs water in a sieve: give not me counsel;\r\nNor let no comforter delight mine ear\r\nBut such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine:\r\nBring me a father that so lov’d his child,\r\nWhose joy of her is overwhelm’d like mine,\r\nAnd bid him speak of patience;\r\nMeasure his woe the length and breadth of mine,\r\nAnd let it answer every strain for strain,\r\nAs thus for thus and such a grief for such,\r\nIn every lineament, branch, shape, and form:\r\nIf such a one will smile, and stroke his beard;\r\nBid sorrow wag, cry ‘hem’ when he should groan,\r\nPatch grief with proverbs; make misfortune drunk\r\nWith candle-wasters; bring him yet to me,\r\nAnd I of him will gather patience.\r\nBut there is no such man; for, brother, men\r\nCan counsel and speak comfort to that grief\r\nWhich they themselves not feel; but, tasting it,\r\nTheir counsel turns to passion, which before\r\nWould give preceptial medicine to rage,\r\nFetter strong madness in a silken thread,\r\nCharm ache with air and agony with words.\r\nNo, no; ’tis all men’s office to speak patience\r\nTo those that wring under the load of sorrow,\r\nBut no man’s virtue nor sufficiency\r\nTo be so moral when he shall endure\r\nThe like himself. Therefore give me no counsel:\r\nMy griefs cry louder than advertisement.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nTherein do men from children nothing differ.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nI pray thee peace! I will be flesh and blood;\r\nFor there was never yet philosopher\r\nThat could endure the toothache patiently,\r\nHowever they have writ the style of gods\r\nAnd made a push at chance and sufferance.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nYet bend not all the harm upon yourself;\r\nMake those that do offend you suffer too.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nThere thou speak’st reason: nay, I will do so.\r\nMy soul doth tell me Hero is belied;\r\nAnd that shall Claudio know; so shall the Prince,\r\nAnd all of them that thus dishonour her.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nHere comes the Prince and Claudio hastily.\r\n\r\nEnter Don Pedro and Claudio.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nGood den, good den.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nGood day to both of you.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nHear you, my lords,—\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nWe have some haste, Leonato.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nSome haste, my lord! well, fare you well, my lord:\r\nAre you so hasty now?—well, all is one.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nNay, do not quarrel with us, good old man.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nIf he could right himself with quarrelling,\r\nSome of us would lie low.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nWho wrongs him?\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nMarry, thou dost wrong me; thou dissembler, thou.\r\nNay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword;\r\nI fear thee not.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nMarry, beshrew my hand,\r\nIf it should give your age such cause of fear.\r\nIn faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nTush, tush, man! never fleer and jest at me:\r\nI speak not like a dotard nor a fool,\r\nAs, under privilege of age, to brag\r\nWhat I have done being young, or what would do,\r\nWere I not old. Know, Claudio, to thy head,\r\nThou hast so wrong’d mine innocent child and me\r\nThat I am forc’d to lay my reverence by,\r\nAnd, with grey hairs and bruise of many days,\r\nDo challenge thee to trial of a man.\r\nI say thou hast belied mine innocent child:\r\nThy slander hath gone through and through her heart,\r\nAnd she lies buried with her ancestors;\r\nO! in a tomb where never scandal slept,\r\nSave this of hers, fram’d by thy villainy!\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nMy villainy?\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nThine, Claudio; thine, I say.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nYou say not right, old man.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nMy lord, my lord,\r\n I’ll prove it on his body, if he dare,\r\nDespite his nice fence and his active practice,\r\nHis May of youth and bloom of lustihood.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nAway! I will not have to do with you.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nCanst thou so daff me? Thou hast kill’d my child;\r\nIf thou kill’st me, boy, thou shalt kill a man.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nHe shall kill two of us, and men indeed:\r\nBut that’s no matter; let him kill one first:\r\nWin me and wear me; let him answer me.\r\nCome, follow me, boy; come, sir boy, come, follow me.\r\nSir boy, I’ll whip you from your foining fence;\r\nNay, as I am a gentleman, I will.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nBrother,—\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nContent yourself. God knows I lov’d my niece;\r\nAnd she is dead, slander’d to death by villains,\r\nThat dare as well answer a man indeed\r\nAs I dare take a serpent by the tongue.\r\nBoys, apes, braggarts, Jacks, milksops!\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nBrother Anthony,—\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nHold you content. What, man! I know them, yea,\r\nAnd what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple,\r\nScambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boys,\r\nThat lie and cog and flout, deprave and slander,\r\nGo antickly, show outward hideousness,\r\nAnd speak off half a dozen dangerous words,\r\nHow they might hurt their enemies, if they durst;\r\nAnd this is all!\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nBut, brother Anthony,—\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nCome, ’tis no matter:\r\nDo not you meddle, let me deal in this.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nGentlemen both, we will not wake your patience.\r\nMy heart is sorry for your daughter’s death;\r\nBut, on my honour, she was charg’d with nothing\r\nBut what was true and very full of proof.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nMy lord, my lord—\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nI will not hear you.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nNo? Come, brother, away. I will be heard.—\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nAnd shall, or some of us will smart for it.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt Leonato and Antonio.]\r\n\r\nEnter Benedick.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nSee, see; here comes the man we went to seek.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nNow, signior, what news?\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nGood day, my lord.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nWelcome, signior: you are almost come to part almost a fray.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nWe had like to have had our two noses snapped off with two old\r\nmen without teeth.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nLeonato and his brother. What think’st thou? Had we\r\nfought, I doubt we should have been too young for them.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nIn a false quarrel there is no true valour. I came to seek you both.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nWe have been up and down to seek thee; for we are high-proof\r\nmelancholy, and would fain have it beaten away. Wilt thou use thy wit?\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nIt is in my scabbard; shall I draw it?\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nDost thou wear thy wit by thy side?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nNever any did so, though very many have been beside their wit. I\r\nwill bid thee draw, as we do the minstrels; draw, to pleasure us.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nAs I am an honest man, he looks pale. Art thou sick, or angry?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nWhat, courage, man! What though care killed a cat, thou hast\r\nmettle enough in thee to kill care.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nSir, I shall meet your wit in the career, and you charge it\r\nagainst me. I pray you choose another subject.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nNay then, give him another staff: this last was broke cross.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nBy this light, he changes more and more: I think he be angry indeed.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nIf he be, he knows how to turn his girdle.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nShall I speak a word in your ear?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nGod bless me from a challenge!\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\n[Aside to Claudio.] You are a villain, I jest not: I will\r\nmake it good how you dare, with what you dare, and when you dare. Do me\r\nright, or I will protest your cowardice. You have killed a sweet lady, and\r\nher death shall fall heavy on you. Let me hear from you.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nWell I will meet you, so I may have good cheer.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nWhat, a feast, a feast?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nI’ faith, I thank him; he hath bid me to a calf’s-head\r\nand a capon, the which if I do not carve most curiously, say my knife’s\r\nnaught. Shall I not find a woodcock too?\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nSir, your wit ambles well; it goes easily.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nI’ll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit the\r\nother day. I said, thou hadst a fine wit. ‘True,’ says\r\nshe, ‘a fine little one.’ ‘No,’ said I,\r\n‘a great wit.’ ‘Right,’ said she, ‘a\r\ngreat gross one.’ ‘Nay,’ said I, ‘a good wit.’\r\n‘Just,’ said she, ‘it hurts nobody.’ ‘Nay,’\r\nsaid I, ‘the gentleman is wise.’ ‘Certain,’\r\nsaid she, ‘a wise gentleman.’ ‘Nay,’ said I,\r\n‘he hath the tongues.’ ‘That I believe’ said\r\nshe, ‘for he swore a thing to me on Monday night, which he\r\nforswore on Tuesday morning: there’s a double tongue; there’s\r\ntwo tongues.’ Thus did she, an hour together, trans-shape thy\r\nparticular virtues; yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou wast\r\nthe properest man in Italy.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nFor the which she wept heartily and said she cared not.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nYea, that she did; but yet, for all that, an if she did not\r\nhate him deadly, she would love him dearly. The old man’s daughter\r\ntold us all.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nAll, all; and moreover, God saw him when he was hid in the garden.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nBut when shall we set the savage bull’s horns on the\r\nsensible Benedick’s head?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nYea, and text underneath, ‘Here dwells Benedick the\r\nmarried man!’\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nFare you well, boy: you know my mind. I will leave you now to\r\nyour gossip-like humour; you break jests as braggarts do their blades,\r\nwhich, God be thanked, hurt not. My lord, for your many courtesies I thank\r\nyou: I must discontinue your company. Your brother the bastard is fled\r\nfrom Messina: you have, among you, killed a sweet and innocent lady. For\r\nmy Lord Lack-beard there, he and I shall meet; and till then, peace be\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nHe is in earnest.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nIn most profound earnest; and, I’ll warrant you, for\r\nthe love of Beatrice.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nAnd hath challenged thee?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nMost sincerely.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nWhat a pretty thing man is when he goes in his doublet and hose\r\nand leaves off his wit!\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nHe is then a giant to an ape; but then is an ape a doctor to such\r\na man.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nBut, soft you; let me be: pluck up, my heart, and be sad! Did\r\nhe not say my brother was fled?\r\n\r\nEnter Dogberry, Verges, and the Watch, with\r\nConrade and Borachio.\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nCome you, sir: if justice cannot tame you, she shall ne’er\r\nweigh more reasons in her balance. Nay, an you be a cursing hypocrite\r\nonce, you must be looked to.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nHow now! two of my brother’s men bound! Borachio, one!\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nHearken after their offence, my lord.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nOfficers, what offence have these men done?\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nMarry, sir, they have committed false report; moreover, they\r\nhave spoken untruths; secondarily, they are slanders; sixth and lastly,\r\nthey have belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjust things; and to\r\nconclude, they are lying knaves.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nFirst, I ask thee what they have done; thirdly, I ask thee what’s\r\ntheir offence; sixth and lastly, why they are committed; and, to conclude,\r\nwhat you lay to their charge?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nRightly reasoned, and in his own division; and, by my troth,\r\nthere’s one meaning well suited.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nWho have you offended, masters, that you are thus bound to\r\nyour answer? This learned constable is too cunning to be understood.\r\nWhat’s your offence?\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nSweet Prince, let me go no farther to mine answer: do you hear\r\nme, and let this Count kill me. I have deceived even your very eyes: what\r\nyour wisdoms could not discover, these shallow fools have brought to\r\nlight; who, in the night overheard me confessing to this man how Don John\r\nyour brother incensed me to slander the Lady Hero; how you were brought\r\ninto the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Hero’s garments; how\r\nyou disgraced her, when you should marry her. My villainy they have upon\r\nrecord; which I had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my\r\nshame. The lady is dead upon mine and my master’s false accusation;\r\nand, briefly, I desire nothing but the reward of a villain.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nRuns not this speech like iron through your blood?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nI have drunk poison whiles he utter’d it.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nBut did my brother set thee on to this?\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nYea; and paid me richly for the practice of it.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nHe is compos’d and fram’d of treachery:\r\nAnd fled he is upon this villainy.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nSweet Hero! now thy image doth appear\r\nIn the rare semblance that I lov’d it first.\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nCome, bring away the plaintiffs: by this time our sexton hath\r\nreformed Signior Leonato of the matter. And masters, do not forget to\r\nspecify, when time and place shall serve, that I am an ass.\r\n\r\nVERGES.\r\nHere, here comes Master Signior Leonato, and the sexton too.\r\n\r\nRe-enter Leonato, Antonio and the Sexton.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nWhich is the villain? Let me see his eyes,\r\nThat, when I note another man like him,\r\nI may avoid him. Which of these is he?\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nIf you would know your wronger, look on me.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nArt thou the slave that with thy breath hast kill’d\r\nMine innocent child?\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nYea, even I alone.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nNo, not so, villain; thou beliest thyself:\r\nHere stand a pair of honourable men;\r\nA third is fled, that had a hand in it.\r\nI thank you, princes, for my daughter’s death:\r\nRecord it with your high and worthy deeds.\r\n’Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nI know not how to pray your patience;\r\nYet I must speak. Choose your revenge yourself;\r\nImpose me to what penance your invention\r\nCan lay upon my sin: yet sinn’d I not\r\nBut in mistaking.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nBy my soul, nor I:\r\nAnd yet, to satisfy this good old man,\r\nI would bend under any heavy weight\r\nThat he’ll enjoin me to.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nI cannot bid you bid my daughter live;\r\nThat were impossible; but, I pray you both,\r\nPossess the people in Messina here\r\nHow innocent she died; and if your love\r\nCan labour aught in sad invention,\r\nHang her an epitaph upon her tomb,\r\nAnd sing it to her bones: sing it tonight.\r\nTomorrow morning come you to my house,\r\nAnd since you could not be my son-in-law,\r\nBe yet my nephew. My brother hath a daughter,\r\nAlmost the copy of my child that’s dead,\r\nAnd she alone is heir to both of us:\r\nGive her the right you should have given her cousin,\r\nAnd so dies my revenge.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nO noble sir,\r\nYour over-kindness doth wring tears from me!\r\nI do embrace your offer; and dispose\r\nFor henceforth of poor Claudio.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nTomorrow then I will expect your coming;\r\nTonight I take my leave. This naughty man\r\nShall face to face be brought to Margaret,\r\nWho, I believe, was pack’d in all this wrong,\r\nHir’d to it by your brother.\r\n\r\nBORACHIO.\r\nNo, by my soul she was not;\r\nNor knew not what she did when she spoke to me;\r\nBut always hath been just and virtuous\r\nIn anything that I do know by her.\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nMoreover, sir,—which, indeed, is not under white and black,—\r\nthis plaintiff here, the offender, did call me ass: I beseech you, let it\r\nbe remembered in his punishment. And also, the watch heard them talk of\r\none Deformed: they say he wears a key in his ear and a lock hanging by it,\r\nand borrows money in God’s name, the which he hath used so long and\r\nnever paid, that now men grow hard-hearted, and will lend nothing for God’s\r\nsake. Pray you, examine him upon that point.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nI thank thee for thy care and honest pains.\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nYour worship speaks like a most thankful and reverent\r\nyouth, and I praise God for you.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nThere’s for thy pains.\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nGod save the foundation!\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nGo, I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I thank thee.\r\n\r\nDOGBERRY.\r\nI leave an arrant knave with your worship; which I beseech your\r\nworship to correct yourself, for the example of others. God keep your\r\nworship! I wish your worship well; God restore you to health! I humbly\r\ngive you leave to depart, and if a merry meeting may be wished, God\r\nprohibit it! Come, neighbour.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt Dogberry and Verges.]\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nUntil tomorrow morning, lords, farewell.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nFarewell, my lords: we look for you tomorrow.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nWe will not fail.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nTonight I’ll mourn with Hero.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt Don Pedro and Claudio.]\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\n[To the Watch.] Bring you these fellows on. We’ll talk with\r\nMargaret,\r\nHow her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellow.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. Leonato’s Garden.\r\n\r\nEnter Benedick and Margaret,\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nPray thee, sweet Mistress Margaret, deserve well at my hands by\r\nhelping me to the speech of Beatrice.\r\n\r\nMARGARET.\r\nWill you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty?\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nIn so high a style, Margaret, that no man living shall come over\r\nit; for, in most comely truth, thou deservest it.\r\n\r\nMARGARET.\r\nTo have no man come over me! why, shall I always keep below stairs?\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nThy wit is as quick as the greyhound’s mouth; it catches.\r\n\r\nMARGARET.\r\nAnd yours as blunt as the fencer’s foils, which hit, but hurt not.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nA most manly wit, Margaret; it will not hurt a woman: and so, I\r\npray thee, call Beatrice. I give thee the bucklers.\r\n\r\nMARGARET.\r\nGive us the swords, we have bucklers of our own.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nIf you use them, Margaret, you must put in the pikes with a\r\nvice; and they are dangerous weapons for maids.\r\n\r\nMARGARET.\r\nWell, I will call Beatrice to you, who I think hath legs.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nAnd therefore will come.\r\n\r\n[Exit Margaret.]\r\n\r\n The god of love,\r\n That sits above,\r\n And knows me, and knows me,\r\nHow pitiful I deserve,—\r\n\r\nI mean, in singing: but in loving, Leander the good swimmer, Troilus the\r\nfirst employer of panders, and a whole book full of these quondam\r\ncarpet-mongers, whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a blank\r\nverse, why, they were never so truly turned over and over as my poor self\r\nin love. Marry, I cannot show it in rime; I have tried: I can find out no\r\nrime to ‘lady’ but ‘baby’, an innocent rime; for\r\n‘scorn,’ ‘horn’, a hard rime; for ‘school’,\r\n‘fool’, a babbling rime; very ominous endings: no, I was not\r\nborn under a riming planet, nor I cannot woo in festival terms.\r\n\r\nEnter Beatrice.\r\n\r\nSweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called thee?\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nYea, signior; and depart when you bid me.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nO, stay but till then!\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\n‘Then’ is spoken; fare you well now: and yet, ere I\r\ngo, let me go with that I came for; which is, with knowing what hath\r\npassed between you and Claudio.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nOnly foul words; and thereupon I will kiss thee.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nFoul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is but foul breath,\r\nand foul breath is noisome; therefore I will depart unkissed.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nThou hast frighted the word out of his right sense, so forcible\r\nis thy wit. But I must tell thee plainly, Claudio undergoes my challenge,\r\nand either I must shortly hear from him, or I will subscribe him a coward.\r\nAnd, I pray thee now, tell me, for which of my bad parts didst thou first\r\nfall in love with me?\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nFor them all together; which maintained so politic a state\r\nof evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with\r\nthem. But for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me?\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\n‘Suffer love,’ a good epithet! I do suffer love\r\nindeed, for I love thee against my will.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nIn spite of your heart, I think. Alas, poor heart! If you spite\r\nit for my sake, I will spite it for yours; for I will never love that\r\nwhich my friend hates.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nThou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nIt appears not in this confession: there’s not one wise\r\nman among twenty that will praise himself.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nAn old, an old instance, Beatrice, that lived in the time of\r\ngood neighbours. If a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he\r\ndies, he shall live no longer in monument than the bell rings and the\r\nwidow weeps.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\n And how long is that think you?\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nQuestion: why, an hour in clamour and a quarter in rheum:\r\ntherefore is it most expedient for the wise,—if Don Worm, his conscience,\r\nfind no impediment to the contrary,—to be the trumpet of his own virtues,\r\nas I am to myself. So much for praising myself, who, I myself will bear\r\nwitness, is praiseworthy. And now tell me, how doth your cousin?\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nVery ill.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nAnd how do you?\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nVery ill too.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nServe God, love me, and mend. There will I leave you too, for\r\nhere comes one in haste.\r\n\r\nEnter Ursula.\r\n\r\nURSULA.\r\nMadam, you must come to your uncle. Yonder’s old coil at\r\nhome: it is proved, my Lady Hero hath been falsely accused, the Prince and\r\nClaudio mightily abused; and Don John is the author of all, who is fled\r\nand gone. Will you come presently?\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nWill you go hear this news, signior?\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nI will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be buried in thy\r\neyes; and moreover I will go with thee to thy uncle’s.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. The Inside of a Church.\r\n\r\nEnter Don Pedro, Claudio and Attendants,\r\nwith music and tapers.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nIs this the monument of Leonato?\r\n\r\nA LORD.\r\nIt is, my lord.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\n[Reads from a scroll.]\r\n\r\nEpitaph.\r\n\r\n Done to death by slanderous tongues\r\n Was the Hero that here lies:\r\n Death, in guerdon of her wrongs,\r\n Gives her fame which never dies.\r\nSo the life that died with shame\r\n Lives in death with glorious fame.\r\n\r\nHang thou there upon the tomb,\r\n\r\nPraising her when I am dumb.\r\nNow, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.\r\n\r\nSong.\r\n\r\n Pardon, goddess of the night,\r\n Those that slew thy virgin knight;\r\n For the which, with songs of woe,\r\n Round about her tomb they go.\r\n Midnight, assist our moan;\r\n Help us to sigh and groan,\r\n Heavily, heavily:\r\nGraves, yawn and yield your dead,\r\n Till death be uttered,\r\n Heavily, heavily.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nNow, unto thy bones good night!\r\nYearly will I do this rite.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nGood morrow, masters: put your torches out.\r\nThe wolves have prey’d; and look, the gentle day,\r\nBefore the wheels of Phoebus, round about\r\nDapples the drowsy East with spots of grey.\r\nThanks to you all, and leave us: fare you well.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nGood morrow, masters: each his several way.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nCome, let us hence, and put on other weeds;\r\nAnd then to Leonato’s we will go.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nAnd Hymen now with luckier issue speed’s,\r\nThan this for whom we rend’red up this woe!\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV. A Room in Leonato’s House.\r\n\r\nEnter Leonato, Antonio, Benedick, Beatrice,\r\nMargaret, Ursula, Friar Francis and Hero.\r\n\r\nFRIAR.\r\nDid I not tell you she was innocent?\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nSo are the Prince and Claudio, who accus’d her\r\nUpon the error that you heard debated:\r\nBut Margaret was in some fault for this,\r\nAlthough against her will, as it appears\r\nIn the true course of all the question.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nWell, I am glad that all things sort so well.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nAnd so am I, being else by faith enforc’d\r\nTo call young Claudio to a reckoning for it.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nWell, daughter, and you gentlewomen all,\r\nWithdraw into a chamber by yourselves,\r\nAnd when I send for you, come hither mask’d:\r\nThe Prince and Claudio promis’d by this hour\r\nTo visit me.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt Ladies.]\r\n\r\nYou know your office, brother;\r\nYou must be father to your brother’s daughter,\r\nAnd give her to young Claudio.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nWhich I will do with confirm’d countenance.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nFriar, I must entreat your pains, I think.\r\n\r\nFRIAR.\r\nTo do what, signior?\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nTo bind me, or undo me; one of them.\r\nSignior Leonato, truth it is, good signior,\r\nYour niece regards me with an eye of favour.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nThat eye my daughter lent her. ’Tis most true.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nAnd I do with an eye of love requite her.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nThe sight whereof I think, you had from me,\r\nFrom Claudio, and the Prince. But what’s your will?\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nYour answer, sir, is enigmatical:\r\nBut, for my will, my will is your good will\r\nMay stand with ours, this day to be conjoin’d\r\nIn the state of honourable marriage:\r\nIn which, good friar, I shall desire your help.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nMy heart is with your liking.\r\n\r\nFRIAR.\r\nAnd my help. Here comes the Prince and Claudio.\r\n\r\nEnter Don Pedro and Claudio,\r\nwith Attendants.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nGood morrow to this fair assembly.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nGood morrow, Prince; good morrow, Claudio:\r\nWe here attend you. Are you yet determin’d\r\nToday to marry with my brother’s daughter?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nI’ll hold my mind, were she an Ethiope.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nCall her forth, brother: here’s the friar ready.\r\n\r\n[Exit Antonio.]\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nGood morrow, Benedick. Why, what’s the matter,\r\nThat you have such a February face,\r\nSo full of frost, of storm and cloudiness?\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nI think he thinks upon the savage bull.\r\nTush! fear not, man, we’ll tip thy horns with gold,\r\nAnd all Europa shall rejoice at thee,\r\nAs once Europa did at lusty Jove,\r\nWhen he would play the noble beast in love.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nBull Jove, sir, had an amiable low:\r\nAnd some such strange bull leap’d your father’s cow,\r\nAnd got a calf in that same noble feat,\r\nMuch like to you, for you have just his bleat.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nFor this I owe you: here comes other reckonings.\r\n\r\nRe-enter Antonio, with the ladies masked.\r\n\r\nWhich is the lady I must seize upon?\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nThis same is she, and I do give you her.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nWhy then, she’s mine. Sweet, let me see your face.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nNo, that you shall not, till you take her hand\r\nBefore this friar, and swear to marry her.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nGive me your hand: before this holy friar,\r\nI am your husband, if you like of me.\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nAnd when I liv’d, I was your other wife:\r\n[Unmasking.] And when you lov’d, you were my other husband.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nAnother Hero!\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nNothing certainer:\r\nOne Hero died defil’d, but I do live,\r\nAnd surely as I live, I am a maid.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nThe former Hero! Hero that is dead!\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nShe died, my lord, but whiles her slander liv’d.\r\n\r\nFRIAR.\r\nAll this amazement can I qualify:\r\nWhen after that the holy rites are ended,\r\nI’ll tell you largely of fair Hero’s death:\r\nMeantime, let wonder seem familiar,\r\nAnd to the chapel let us presently.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nSoft and fair, friar. Which is Beatrice?\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\n[Unmasking.] I answer to that name. What is your will?\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nDo not you love me?\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nWhy, no; no more than reason.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nWhy, then, your uncle and the Prince and Claudio\r\nHave been deceived; for they swore you did.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nDo not you love me?\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nTroth, no; no more than reason.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nWhy, then my cousin, Margaret, and Ursula,\r\nAre much deceiv’d; for they did swear you did.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nThey swore that you were almost sick for me.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nThey swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\n’Tis no such matter. Then you do not love me?\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nNo, truly, but in friendly recompense.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nCome, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nAnd I’ll be sworn upon ’t that he loves her;\r\nFor here’s a paper written in his hand,\r\nA halting sonnet of his own pure brain,\r\nFashion’d to Beatrice.\r\n\r\nHERO.\r\nAnd here’s another,\r\nWrit in my cousin’s hand, stolen from her pocket,\r\nContaining her affection unto Benedick.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nA miracle! here’s our own hands against our hearts. Come,\r\nI will have thee; but, by this light, I take thee for pity.\r\n\r\nBEATRICE.\r\nI would not deny you; but, by this good day, I yield upon great\r\npersuasion, and partly to save your life, for I was told you were in a\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nPeace! I will stop your mouth. [Kisses her.]\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO.\r\nHow dost thou, Benedick, the married man?\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nI’ll tell thee what, Prince; a college of witcrackers cannot flout me\r\nout of my humour. Dost thou think I care for a satire or an epigram?\r\nNo; if man will be beaten with brains, a’ shall wear nothing handsome\r\nabout him. In brief, since I do purpose to marry, I will think nothing\r\nto any purpose that the world can say against it; and therefore never\r\nflout at me for what I have said against it, for man is a giddy thing,\r\nand this is my conclusion. For thy part, Claudio, I did think to have\r\nbeaten thee; but, in that thou art like to be my kinsman, live\r\nunbruised, and love my cousin.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIO.\r\nI had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice, that I might\r\nhave cudgelled thee out of thy single life, to make thee a double-dealer;\r\nwhich, out of question, thou wilt be, if my cousin do not look exceeding\r\nnarrowly to thee.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nCome, come, we are friends. Let’s have a dance ere we are\r\nmarried, that we may lighten our own hearts and our wives’ heels.\r\n\r\nLEONATO.\r\nWe’ll have dancing afterward.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nFirst, of my word; therefore play, music! Prince, thou art sad;\r\nget thee a wife, get thee a wife: there is no staff more reverent than one\r\ntipped with horn.\r\n\r\nEnter Messenger.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nMy lord, your brother John is ta’en in flight,\r\nAnd brought with armed men back to Messina.\r\n\r\nBENEDICK.\r\nThink not on him till tomorrow: I’ll devise thee\r\nbrave punishments for him. Strike up, pipers!\r\n\r\n[Dance. Exeunt.]\r\n\nTHE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, THE MOOR OF VENICE\r\n\nContents\r\n\r\n ACT I\r\n Scene I. Venice. A street\r\n Scene II. Venice.

Venice. A street.\r\n\nEnter Roderigo and Iago.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nTush, never tell me, I take it much unkindly\r\nThat thou, Iago, who hast had my purse,\r\nAs if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\n’Sblood, but you will not hear me.\r\nIf ever I did dream of such a matter,\r\nAbhor me.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nThou told’st me, thou didst hold him in thy hate.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nDespise me if I do not. Three great ones of the city,\r\nIn personal suit to make me his lieutenant,\r\nOff-capp’d to him; and by the faith of man,\r\nI know my price, I am worth no worse a place.\r\nBut he, as loving his own pride and purposes,\r\nEvades them, with a bombast circumstance,\r\nHorribly stuff’d with epithets of war:\r\nAnd in conclusion,\r\nNonsuits my mediators: for “Certes,” says he,\r\n“I have already chose my officer.”\r\nAnd what was he?\r\nForsooth, a great arithmetician,\r\nOne Michael Cassio, a Florentine,\r\nA fellow almost damn’d in a fair wife,\r\nThat never set a squadron in the field,\r\nNor the division of a battle knows\r\nMore than a spinster, unless the bookish theoric,\r\nWherein the toged consuls can propose\r\nAs masterly as he: mere prattle without practice\r\nIs all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election,\r\nAnd I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof\r\nAt Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds,\r\nChristian and heathen, must be belee’d and calm’d\r\nBy debitor and creditor, this counter-caster,\r\nHe, in good time, must his lieutenant be,\r\nAnd I, God bless the mark, his Moorship’s ancient.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nBy heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhy, there’s no remedy. ’Tis the curse of service,\r\nPreferment goes by letter and affection,\r\nAnd not by old gradation, where each second\r\nStood heir to the first. Now sir, be judge yourself\r\nWhether I in any just term am affin’d\r\nTo love the Moor.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nI would not follow him, then.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nO, sir, content you.\r\nI follow him to serve my turn upon him:\r\nWe cannot all be masters, nor all masters\r\nCannot be truly follow’d. You shall mark\r\nMany a duteous and knee-crooking knave\r\nThat, doting on his own obsequious bondage,\r\nWears out his time, much like his master’s ass,\r\nFor nought but provender, and when he’s old, cashier’d.\r\nWhip me such honest knaves. Others there are\r\nWho, trimm’d in forms, and visages of duty,\r\nKeep yet their hearts attending on themselves,\r\nAnd throwing but shows of service on their lords,\r\nDo well thrive by them, and when they have lin’d their coats,\r\nDo themselves homage. These fellows have some soul,\r\nAnd such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,\r\nIt is as sure as you are Roderigo,\r\nWere I the Moor, I would not be Iago:\r\nIn following him, I follow but myself.\r\nHeaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,\r\nBut seeming so for my peculiar end.\r\nFor when my outward action doth demonstrate\r\nThe native act and figure of my heart\r\nIn complement extern, ’tis not long after\r\nBut I will wear my heart upon my sleeve\r\nFor daws to peck at: I am not what I am.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nWhat a full fortune does the thick-lips owe,\r\nIf he can carry’t thus!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nCall up her father,\r\nRouse him, make after him, poison his delight,\r\nProclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,\r\nAnd though he in a fertile climate dwell,\r\nPlague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,\r\nYet throw such changes of vexation on’t,\r\nAs it may lose some color.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nHere is her father’s house, I’ll call aloud.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nDo, with like timorous accent and dire yell\r\nAs when, by night and negligence, the fire\r\nIs spied in populous cities.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nWhat ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nAwake! what ho, Brabantio! Thieves, thieves!\r\nLook to your house, your daughter, and your bags!\r\nThieves, thieves!\r\n\r\nBrabantio appears above at a window.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nWhat is the reason of this terrible summons?\r\nWhat is the matter there?\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nSignior, is all your family within?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nAre your doors locked?\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nWhy, wherefore ask you this?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nZounds, sir, you’re robb’d, for shame put on your gown,\r\nYour heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;\r\nEven now, now, very now, an old black ram\r\nIs tupping your white ewe. Arise, arise,\r\nAwake the snorting citizens with the bell,\r\nOr else the devil will make a grandsire of you:\r\nArise, I say.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nWhat, have you lost your wits?\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nMost reverend signior, do you know my voice?\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nNot I. What are you?\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nMy name is Roderigo.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nThe worser welcome.\r\nI have charg’d thee not to haunt about my doors;\r\nIn honest plainness thou hast heard me say\r\nMy daughter is not for thee; and now in madness,\r\nBeing full of supper and distempering draughts,\r\nUpon malicious bravery, dost thou come\r\nTo start my quiet.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nSir, sir, sir,—\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nBut thou must needs be sure\r\nMy spirit and my place have in them power\r\nTo make this bitter to thee.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nPatience, good sir.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nWhat tell’st thou me of robbing?\r\nThis is Venice. My house is not a grange.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nMost grave Brabantio,\r\nIn simple and pure soul I come to you.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nZounds, sir, you are one of those that will not serve God if the devil\r\nbid you. Because we come to do you service, and you think we are\r\nruffians, you’ll have your daughter cover’d with a Barbary horse;\r\nyou’ll have your nephews neigh to you; you’ll have coursers for cousins\r\nand gennets for germans.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nWhat profane wretch art thou?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are\r\nnow making the beast with two backs.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nThou art a villain.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nYou are a senator.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nThis thou shalt answer. I know thee, Roderigo.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nSir, I will answer anything. But I beseech you,\r\nIf ’t be your pleasure, and most wise consent,\r\n(As partly I find it is) that your fair daughter,\r\nAt this odd-even and dull watch o’ the night,\r\nTransported with no worse nor better guard,\r\nBut with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,\r\nTo the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor:\r\nIf this be known to you, and your allowance,\r\nWe then have done you bold and saucy wrongs.\r\nBut if you know not this, my manners tell me,\r\nWe have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe\r\nThat from the sense of all civility,\r\nI thus would play and trifle with your reverence.\r\nYour daughter (if you have not given her leave)\r\nI say again, hath made a gross revolt,\r\nTying her duty, beauty, wit, and fortunes\r\nIn an extravagant and wheeling stranger\r\nOf here and everywhere. Straight satisfy yourself:\r\nIf she be in her chamber or your house,\r\nLet loose on me the justice of the state\r\nFor thus deluding you.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nStrike on the tinder, ho!\r\nGive me a taper! Call up all my people!\r\nThis accident is not unlike my dream,\r\nBelief of it oppresses me already.\r\nLight, I say, light!\r\n\r\n[_Exit from above._]\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nFarewell; for I must leave you:\r\nIt seems not meet nor wholesome to my place\r\nTo be produc’d, as if I stay I shall,\r\nAgainst the Moor. For I do know the state,\r\nHowever this may gall him with some check,\r\nCannot with safety cast him, for he’s embark’d\r\nWith such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,\r\nWhich even now stand in act, that, for their souls,\r\nAnother of his fathom they have none\r\nTo lead their business. In which regard,\r\nThough I do hate him as I do hell pains,\r\nYet, for necessity of present life,\r\nI must show out a flag and sign of love,\r\nWhich is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,\r\nLead to the Sagittary the raised search,\r\nAnd there will I be with him. So, farewell.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nEnter Brabantio with Servants and torches.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nIt is too true an evil. Gone she is,\r\nAnd what’s to come of my despised time,\r\nIs naught but bitterness. Now Roderigo,\r\nWhere didst thou see her? (O unhappy girl!)\r\nWith the Moor, say’st thou? (Who would be a father!)\r\nHow didst thou know ’twas she? (O, she deceives me\r\nPast thought.) What said she to you? Get more tapers,\r\nRaise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nTruly I think they are.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nO heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!\r\nFathers, from hence trust not your daughters’ minds\r\nBy what you see them act. Is there not charms\r\nBy which the property of youth and maidhood\r\nMay be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,\r\nOf some such thing?\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nYes, sir, I have indeed.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nCall up my brother. O, would you had had her!\r\nSome one way, some another. Do you know\r\nWhere we may apprehend her and the Moor?\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nI think I can discover him, if you please\r\nTo get good guard, and go along with me.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nPray you lead on. At every house I’ll call,\r\nI may command at most. Get weapons, ho!\r\nAnd raise some special officers of night.\r\nOn, good Roderigo. I will deserve your pains.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II.

But I pray you, sir,\r\nAre you fast married? Be assur’d of this,\r\nThat the magnifico is much belov’d\r\nAnd hath in his effect a voice potential\r\nAs double as the duke’s; he will divorce you,\r\nOr put upon you what restraint and grievance\r\nThe law (with all his might to enforce it on)\r\nWill give him cable.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nLet him do his spite;\r\nMy services, which I have done the signiory,\r\nShall out-tongue his complaints. ’Tis yet to know,—\r\nWhich, when I know that boasting is an honour,\r\nI shall promulgate,—I fetch my life and being\r\nFrom men of royal siege. And my demerits\r\nMay speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune\r\nAs this that I have reach’d. For know, Iago,\r\nBut that I love the gentle Desdemona,\r\nI would not my unhoused free condition\r\nPut into circumscription and confine\r\nFor the sea’s worth. But look, what lights come yond?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nThose are the raised father and his friends:\r\nYou were best go in.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nNot I; I must be found.\r\nMy parts, my title, and my perfect soul\r\nShall manifest me rightly. Is it they?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nBy Janus, I think no.\r\n\r\nEnter Cassio and Officers with torches.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nThe servants of the duke and my lieutenant.\r\nThe goodness of the night upon you, friends!\r\nWhat is the news?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nThe duke does greet you, general,\r\nAnd he requires your haste-post-haste appearance\r\nEven on the instant.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWhat is the matter, think you?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nSomething from Cyprus, as I may divine.\r\nIt is a business of some heat. The galleys\r\nHave sent a dozen sequent messengers\r\nThis very night at one another’s heels;\r\nAnd many of the consuls, rais’d and met,\r\nAre at the duke’s already. You have been hotly call’d for,\r\nWhen, being not at your lodging to be found,\r\nThe senate hath sent about three several quests\r\nTo search you out.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\n’Tis well I am found by you.\r\nI will but spend a word here in the house,\r\nAnd go with you.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nAncient, what makes he here?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nFaith, he tonight hath boarded a land carrack:\r\nIf it prove lawful prize, he’s made forever.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nI do not understand.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nHe’s married.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nTo who?\r\n\r\nEnter Othello.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nMarry to—Come, captain, will you go?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nHave with you.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nHere comes another troop to seek for you.\r\n\r\nEnter Brabantio, Roderigo and Officers with torches and weapons.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nIt is Brabantio. General, be advis’d,\r\nHe comes to bad intent.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nHolla, stand there!\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nSignior, it is the Moor.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nDown with him, thief!\r\n\r\n[_They draw on both sides._]\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nYou, Roderigo! Come, sir, I am for you.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nKeep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.\r\nGood signior, you shall more command with years\r\nThan with your weapons.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nO thou foul thief, where hast thou stow’d my daughter?\r\nDamn’d as thou art, thou hast enchanted her,\r\nFor I’ll refer me to all things of sense,\r\n(If she in chains of magic were not bound)\r\nWhether a maid so tender, fair, and happy,\r\nSo opposite to marriage, that she shunn’d\r\nThe wealthy curled darlings of our nation,\r\nWould ever have, to incur a general mock,\r\nRun from her guardage to the sooty bosom\r\nOf such a thing as thou—to fear, not to delight.\r\nJudge me the world, if ’tis not gross in sense,\r\nThat thou hast practis’d on her with foul charms,\r\nAbus’d her delicate youth with drugs or minerals\r\nThat weakens motion. I’ll have’t disputed on;\r\n’Tis probable, and palpable to thinking.\r\nI therefore apprehend and do attach thee\r\nFor an abuser of the world, a practiser\r\nOf arts inhibited and out of warrant.—\r\nLay hold upon him, if he do resist,\r\nSubdue him at his peril.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nHold your hands,\r\nBoth you of my inclining and the rest:\r\nWere it my cue to fight, I should have known it\r\nWithout a prompter. Where will you that I go\r\nTo answer this your charge?\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nTo prison, till fit time\r\nOf law and course of direct session\r\nCall thee to answer.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWhat if I do obey?\r\nHow may the duke be therewith satisfied,\r\nWhose messengers are here about my side,\r\nUpon some present business of the state,\r\nTo bring me to him?\r\n\r\nOFFICER.\r\n’Tis true, most worthy signior,\r\nThe duke’s in council, and your noble self,\r\nI am sure is sent for.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nHow? The duke in council?\r\nIn this time of the night? Bring him away;\r\nMine’s not an idle cause. The duke himself,\r\nOr any of my brothers of the state,\r\nCannot but feel this wrong as ’twere their own.\r\nFor if such actions may have passage free,\r\nBond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III.

When we consider\r\nThe importancy of Cyprus to the Turk;\r\nAnd let ourselves again but understand\r\nThat, as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,\r\nSo may he with more facile question bear it,\r\nFor that it stands not in such warlike brace,\r\nBut altogether lacks the abilities\r\nThat Rhodes is dress’d in. If we make thought of this,\r\nWe must not think the Turk is so unskilful\r\nTo leave that latest which concerns him first,\r\nNeglecting an attempt of ease and gain,\r\nTo wake and wage a danger profitless.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nNay, in all confidence, he’s not for Rhodes.\r\n\r\nOFFICER.\r\nHere is more news.\r\n\r\nEnter a Messenger.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nThe Ottomites, reverend and gracious,\r\nSteering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes,\r\nHave there injointed them with an after fleet.\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nAy, so I thought. How many, as you guess?\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nOf thirty sail, and now they do re-stem\r\nTheir backward course, bearing with frank appearance\r\nTheir purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,\r\nYour trusty and most valiant servitor,\r\nWith his free duty recommends you thus,\r\nAnd prays you to believe him.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\n’Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.\r\nMarcus Luccicos, is not he in town?\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nHe’s now in Florence.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWrite from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch.\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nHere comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.\r\n\r\nEnter Brabantio, Othello, Iago, Roderigo and Officers.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nValiant Othello, we must straight employ you\r\nAgainst the general enemy Ottoman.\r\n[_To Brabantio._] I did not see you; welcome, gentle signior,\r\nWe lack’d your counsel and your help tonight.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nSo did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me.\r\nNeither my place, nor aught I heard of business\r\nHath rais’d me from my bed, nor doth the general care\r\nTake hold on me; for my particular grief\r\nIs of so flood-gate and o’erbearing nature\r\nThat it engluts and swallows other sorrows,\r\nAnd it is still itself.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWhy, what’s the matter?\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nMy daughter! O, my daughter!\r\n\r\nDUKE and SENATORS.\r\nDead?\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nAy, to me.\r\nShe is abused, stol’n from me, and corrupted\r\nBy spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;\r\nFor nature so preposterously to err,\r\nBeing not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,\r\nSans witchcraft could not.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWhoe’er he be, that in this foul proceeding,\r\nHath thus beguil’d your daughter of herself,\r\nAnd you of her, the bloody book of law\r\nYou shall yourself read in the bitter letter,\r\nAfter your own sense, yea, though our proper son\r\nStood in your action.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nHumbly I thank your grace.\r\nHere is the man, this Moor, whom now it seems\r\nYour special mandate for the state affairs\r\nHath hither brought.\r\n\r\nALL.\r\nWe are very sorry for ’t.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\n[_To Othello._] What, in your own part, can you say to this?\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nNothing, but this is so.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nMost potent, grave, and reverend signiors,\r\nMy very noble and approv’d good masters:\r\nThat I have ta’en away this old man’s daughter,\r\nIt is most true; true, I have married her.\r\nThe very head and front of my offending\r\nHath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,\r\nAnd little bless’d with the soft phrase of peace;\r\nFor since these arms of mine had seven years’ pith,\r\nTill now some nine moons wasted, they have us’d\r\nTheir dearest action in the tented field,\r\nAnd little of this great world can I speak,\r\nMore than pertains to feats of broil and battle,\r\nAnd therefore little shall I grace my cause\r\nIn speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,\r\nI will a round unvarnish’d tale deliver\r\nOf my whole course of love: what drugs, what charms,\r\nWhat conjuration, and what mighty magic,\r\n(For such proceeding I am charged withal)\r\nI won his daughter.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nA maiden never bold:\r\nOf spirit so still and quiet that her motion\r\nBlush’d at herself; and she, in spite of nature,\r\nOf years, of country, credit, everything,\r\nTo fall in love with what she fear’d to look on!\r\nIt is judgement maim’d and most imperfect\r\nThat will confess perfection so could err\r\nAgainst all rules of nature, and must be driven\r\nTo find out practices of cunning hell,\r\nWhy this should be. I therefore vouch again,\r\nThat with some mixtures powerful o’er the blood,\r\nOr with some dram conjur’d to this effect,\r\nHe wrought upon her.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nTo vouch this is no proof;\r\nWithout more wider and more overt test\r\nThan these thin habits and poor likelihoods\r\nOf modern seeming do prefer against him.\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nBut, Othello, speak:\r\nDid you by indirect and forced courses\r\nSubdue and poison this young maid’s affections?\r\nOr came it by request, and such fair question\r\nAs soul to soul affordeth?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI do beseech you,\r\nSend for the lady to the Sagittary,\r\nAnd let her speak of me before her father.\r\nIf you do find me foul in her report,\r\nThe trust, the office I do hold of you,\r\nNot only take away, but let your sentence\r\nEven fall upon my life.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nFetch Desdemona hither.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nAncient, conduct them, you best know the place.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Iago and Attendants._]\r\n\r\nAnd till she come, as truly as to heaven\r\nI do confess the vices of my blood,\r\nSo justly to your grave ears I’ll present\r\nHow I did thrive in this fair lady’s love,\r\nAnd she in mine.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nSay it, Othello.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nHer father lov’d me, oft invited me,\r\nStill question’d me the story of my life,\r\nFrom year to year—the battles, sieges, fortunes,\r\nThat I have pass’d.\r\nI ran it through, even from my boyish days\r\nTo the very moment that he bade me tell it,\r\nWherein I spake of most disastrous chances,\r\nOf moving accidents by flood and field;\r\nOf hair-breadth scapes i’ th’ imminent deadly breach;\r\nOf being taken by the insolent foe,\r\nAnd sold to slavery, of my redemption thence,\r\nAnd portance in my traveler’s history,\r\nWherein of antres vast and deserts idle,\r\nRough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch heaven,\r\nIt was my hint to speak,—such was the process;\r\nAnd of the Cannibals that each other eat,\r\nThe Anthropophagi, and men whose heads\r\nDo grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear\r\nWould Desdemona seriously incline.\r\nBut still the house affairs would draw her thence,\r\nWhich ever as she could with haste dispatch,\r\nShe’d come again, and with a greedy ear\r\nDevour up my discourse; which I observing,\r\nTook once a pliant hour, and found good means\r\nTo draw from her a prayer of earnest heart\r\nThat I would all my pilgrimage dilate,\r\nWhereof by parcels she had something heard,\r\nBut not intentively. I did consent,\r\nAnd often did beguile her of her tears,\r\nWhen I did speak of some distressful stroke\r\nThat my youth suffer’d. My story being done,\r\nShe gave me for my pains a world of sighs.\r\nShe swore, in faith, ’twas strange, ’twas passing strange;\r\n’Twas pitiful, ’twas wondrous pitiful.\r\nShe wish’d she had not heard it, yet she wish’d\r\nThat heaven had made her such a man: she thank’d me,\r\nAnd bade me, if I had a friend that lov’d her,\r\nI should but teach him how to tell my story,\r\nAnd that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:\r\nShe lov’d me for the dangers I had pass’d,\r\nAnd I lov’d her that she did pity them.\r\nThis only is the witchcraft I have us’d.\r\nHere comes the lady. Let her witness it.\r\n\r\nEnter Desdemona, Iago and Attendants.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nI think this tale would win my daughter too.\r\nGood Brabantio,\r\nTake up this mangled matter at the best.\r\nMen do their broken weapons rather use\r\nThan their bare hands.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nI pray you hear her speak.\r\nIf she confess that she was half the wooer,\r\nDestruction on my head, if my bad blame\r\nLight on the man!—Come hither, gentle mistress:\r\nDo you perceive in all this noble company\r\nWhere most you owe obedience?\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nMy noble father,\r\nI do perceive here a divided duty:\r\nTo you I am bound for life and education.\r\nMy life and education both do learn me\r\nHow to respect you. You are the lord of duty,\r\nI am hitherto your daughter: but here’s my husband.\r\nAnd so much duty as my mother show’d\r\nTo you, preferring you before her father,\r\nSo much I challenge that I may profess\r\nDue to the Moor my lord.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nGod be with you! I have done.\r\nPlease it your grace, on to the state affairs.\r\nI had rather to adopt a child than get it.—\r\nCome hither, Moor:\r\nI here do give thee that with all my heart\r\nWhich, but thou hast already, with all my heart\r\nI would keep from thee.—For your sake, jewel,\r\nI am glad at soul I have no other child,\r\nFor thy escape would teach me tyranny,\r\nTo hang clogs on them.—I have done, my lord.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nLet me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence,\r\nWhich as a grise or step may help these lovers\r\nInto your favour.\r\nWhen remedies are past, the griefs are ended\r\nBy seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.\r\nTo mourn a mischief that is past and gone\r\nIs the next way to draw new mischief on.\r\nWhat cannot be preserved when fortune takes,\r\nPatience her injury a mockery makes.\r\nThe robb’d that smiles steals something from the thief;\r\nHe robs himself that spends a bootless grief.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nSo let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile,\r\nWe lose it not so long as we can smile;\r\nHe bears the sentence well, that nothing bears\r\nBut the free comfort which from thence he hears;\r\nBut he bears both the sentence and the sorrow\r\nThat, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.\r\nThese sentences to sugar or to gall,\r\nBeing strong on both sides, are equivocal:\r\nBut words are words; I never yet did hear\r\nThat the bruis’d heart was pierced through the ear.\r\nI humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThe Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus. Othello, the\r\nfortitude of the place is best known to you. And though we have there a\r\nsubstitute of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a sovereign\r\nmistress of effects, throws a more safer voice on you: you must\r\ntherefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with\r\nthis more stubborn and boisterous expedition.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nThe tyrant custom, most grave senators,\r\nHath made the flinty and steel couch of war\r\nMy thrice-driven bed of down: I do agnize\r\nA natural and prompt alacrity\r\nI find in hardness, and do undertake\r\nThis present wars against the Ottomites.\r\nMost humbly, therefore, bending to your state,\r\nI crave fit disposition for my wife,\r\nDue reference of place and exhibition,\r\nWith such accommodation and besort\r\nAs levels with her breeding.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nIf you please,\r\nBe’t at her father’s.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nI’ll not have it so.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nNor I.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nNor I. I would not there reside,\r\nTo put my father in impatient thoughts,\r\nBy being in his eye. Most gracious duke,\r\nTo my unfolding lend your prosperous ear,\r\nAnd let me find a charter in your voice\r\nT’ assist my simpleness.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWhat would you, Desdemona?\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nThat I did love the Moor to live with him,\r\nMy downright violence and storm of fortunes\r\nMay trumpet to the world: my heart’s subdued\r\nEven to the very quality of my lord.\r\nI saw Othello’s visage in his mind,\r\nAnd to his honours and his valiant parts\r\nDid I my soul and fortunes consecrate.\r\nSo that, dear lords, if I be left behind,\r\nA moth of peace, and he go to the war,\r\nThe rites for which I love him are bereft me,\r\nAnd I a heavy interim shall support\r\nBy his dear absence. Let me go with him.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nLet her have your voice.\r\nVouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not\r\nTo please the palate of my appetite,\r\nNor to comply with heat, the young affects\r\nIn me defunct, and proper satisfaction,\r\nBut to be free and bounteous to her mind.\r\nAnd heaven defend your good souls that you think\r\nI will your serious and great business scant\r\nFor she is with me. No, when light-wing’d toys\r\nOf feather’d Cupid seel with wanton dullness\r\nMy speculative and offic’d instruments,\r\nThat my disports corrupt and taint my business,\r\nLet housewives make a skillet of my helm,\r\nAnd all indign and base adversities\r\nMake head against my estimation.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nBe it as you shall privately determine,\r\nEither for her stay or going. The affair cries haste,\r\nAnd speed must answer it.\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nYou must away tonight.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWith all my heart.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nAt nine i’ the morning here we’ll meet again.\r\nOthello, leave some officer behind,\r\nAnd he shall our commission bring to you,\r\nWith such things else of quality and respect\r\nAs doth import you.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nSo please your grace, my ancient,\r\nA man he is of honesty and trust,\r\nTo his conveyance I assign my wife,\r\nWith what else needful your good grace shall think\r\nTo be sent after me.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nLet it be so.\r\nGood night to everyone. [_To Brabantio._] And, noble signior,\r\nIf virtue no delighted beauty lack,\r\nYour son-in-law is far more fair than black.\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nAdieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.\r\n\r\nBRABANTIO.\r\nLook to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see:\r\nShe has deceiv’d her father, and may thee.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Duke, Senators, Officers, &c._]\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nMy life upon her faith! Honest Iago,\r\nMy Desdemona must I leave to thee.\r\nI prithee, let thy wife attend on her,\r\nAnd bring them after in the best advantage.—\r\nCome, Desdemona, I have but an hour\r\nOf love, of worldly matters, and direction,\r\nTo spend with thee. We must obey the time.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Othello and Desdemona._]\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nIago—\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhat sayst thou, noble heart?\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nWhat will I do, thinkest thou?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhy, go to bed and sleep.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nI will incontinently drown myself.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nIf thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why, thou silly gentleman!\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nIt is silliness to live, when to live is torment; and then have we a\r\nprescription to die when death is our physician.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nO villainous! I have looked upon the world for four times seven years,\r\nand since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never\r\nfound man that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say I would drown\r\nmyself for the love of a guinea-hen, I would change my humanity with a\r\nbaboon.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nWhat should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so fond, but it is not\r\nin my virtue to amend it.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nVirtue! a fig! ’Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus. Our bodies\r\nare gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners. So that if we will\r\nplant nettles or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up thyme, supply it\r\nwith one gender of herbs or distract it with many, either to have it\r\nsterile with idleness or manured with industry, why, the power and\r\ncorrigible authority of this lies in our wills. If the balance of our\r\nlives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the\r\nblood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous\r\nconclusions. But we have reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal\r\nstings, our unbitted lusts; whereof I take this, that you call love, to\r\nbe a sect, or scion.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nIt cannot be.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nIt is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will. Come, be\r\na man. Drown thyself? Drown cats and blind puppies. I have professed me\r\nthy friend, and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of\r\nperdurable toughness; I could never better stead thee than now. Put\r\nmoney in thy purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with an\r\nusurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It cannot be that\r\nDesdemona should long continue her love to the Moor,—put money in thy\r\npurse,—nor he his to her. It was a violent commencement, and thou shalt\r\nsee an answerable sequestration—put but money in thy purse. These Moors\r\nare changeable in their wills. Fill thy purse with money. The food that\r\nto him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as acerb\r\nas the coloquintida. She must change for youth. When she is sated with\r\nhis body, she will find the error of her choice. She must have change,\r\nshe must. Therefore put money in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damn\r\nthyself, do it a more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money\r\nthou canst. If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian\r\nand a supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the\r\ntribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of\r\ndrowning thyself! It is clean out of the way: seek thou rather to be\r\nhanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nWilt thou be fast to my hopes if I depend on the issue?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nThou art sure of me. Go, make money. I have told thee often, and I\r\nretell thee again and again, I hate the Moor. My cause is hearted;\r\nthine hath no less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against\r\nhim: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost thyself a pleasure, me a\r\nsport. There are many events in the womb of time which will be\r\ndelivered. Traverse, go, provide thy money. We will have more of this\r\ntomorrow. Adieu.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nWhere shall we meet i’ the morning?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nAt my lodging.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nI’ll be with thee betimes.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nGo to, farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nWhat say you?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nNo more of drowning, do you hear?\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nI am changed. I’ll sell all my land.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nThus do I ever make my fool my purse.\r\nFor I mine own gain’d knowledge should profane\r\nIf I would time expend with such a snipe\r\nBut for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor,\r\nAnd it is thought abroad that ’twixt my sheets\r\nHe has done my office. I know not if ’t be true,\r\nBut I, for mere suspicion in that kind,\r\nWill do as if for surety. He holds me well,\r\nThe better shall my purpose work on him.\r\nCassio’s a proper man. Let me see now,\r\nTo get his place, and to plume up my will\r\nIn double knavery. How, how? Let’s see.\r\nAfter some time, to abuse Othello’s ear\r\nThat he is too familiar with his wife.\r\nHe hath a person and a smooth dispose,\r\nTo be suspected, fram’d to make women false.\r\nThe Moor is of a free and open nature\r\nThat thinks men honest that but seem to be so,\r\nAnd will as tenderly be led by the nose\r\nAs asses are.\r\nI have’t. It is engender’d. Hell and night\r\nMust bring this monstrous birth to the world’s light.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\nACT II\r\n\r\nSCENE I. A seaport in Cyprus. A Platform.\r\n\nEnter Montano and two Gentlemen.\r\n\r\nMONTANO.\r\nWhat from the cape can you discern at sea?\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\r\nNothing at all, it is a high-wrought flood.\r\nI cannot ’twixt the heaven and the main\r\nDescry a sail.\r\n\r\nMONTANO.\r\nMethinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land.\r\nA fuller blast ne’er shook our battlements.\r\nIf it hath ruffian’d so upon the sea,\r\nWhat ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,\r\nCan hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\r\nA segregation of the Turkish fleet.\r\nFor do but stand upon the foaming shore,\r\nThe chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds,\r\nThe wind-shak’d surge, with high and monstrous main,\r\nSeems to cast water on the burning Bear,\r\nAnd quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole;\r\nI never did like molestation view\r\nOn the enchafed flood.\r\n\r\nMONTANO.\r\nIf that the Turkish fleet\r\nBe not enshelter’d, and embay’d, they are drown’d.\r\nIt is impossible to bear it out.\r\n\r\nEnter a third Gentleman.\r\n\r\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.\r\nNews, lads! Our wars are done.\r\nThe desperate tempest hath so bang’d the Turks\r\nThat their designment halts. A noble ship of Venice\r\nHath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance\r\nOn most part of their fleet.\r\n\r\nMONTANO.\r\nHow? Is this true?\r\n\r\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.\r\nThe ship is here put in,\r\nA Veronessa; Michael Cassio,\r\nLieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,\r\nIs come on shore; the Moor himself at sea,\r\nAnd is in full commission here for Cyprus.\r\n\r\nMONTANO.\r\nI am glad on’t. ’Tis a worthy governor.\r\n\r\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.\r\nBut this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort\r\nTouching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly,\r\nAnd prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted\r\nWith foul and violent tempest.\r\n\r\nMONTANO.\r\nPray heavens he be;\r\nFor I have serv’d him, and the man commands\r\nLike a full soldier. Let’s to the sea-side, ho!\r\nAs well to see the vessel that’s come in\r\nAs to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,\r\nEven till we make the main and the aerial blue\r\nAn indistinct regard.\r\n\r\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.\r\nCome, let’s do so;\r\nFor every minute is expectancy\r\nOf more arrivance.\r\n\r\nEnter Cassio.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nThanks you, the valiant of this warlike isle,\r\nThat so approve the Moor! O, let the heavens\r\nGive him defence against the elements,\r\nFor I have lost him on a dangerous sea.\r\n\r\nMONTANO.\r\nIs he well shipp’d?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nHis bark is stoutly timber’d, and his pilot\r\nOf very expert and approv’d allowance;\r\nTherefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,\r\nStand in bold cure.\r\n\r\n[_Within._] A sail, a sail, a sail!\r\n\r\nEnter a Messenger.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nWhat noise?\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nThe town is empty; on the brow o’ the sea\r\nStand ranks of people, and they cry “A sail!”\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nMy hopes do shape him for the governor.\r\n\r\n[_A shot._]\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\r\nThey do discharge their shot of courtesy.\r\nOur friends at least.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nI pray you, sir, go forth,\r\nAnd give us truth who ’tis that is arriv’d.\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\r\nI shall.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nMONTANO.\r\nBut, good lieutenant, is your general wiv’d?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nMost fortunately: he hath achiev’d a maid\r\nThat paragons description and wild fame,\r\nOne that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,\r\nAnd in the essential vesture of creation\r\nDoes tire the ingener.\r\n\r\nEnter second Gentleman.\r\n\r\nHow now? Who has put in?\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\r\n’Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nHe has had most favourable and happy speed:\r\nTempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,\r\nThe gutter’d rocks, and congregated sands,\r\nTraitors ensteep’d to clog the guiltless keel,\r\nAs having sense of beauty, do omit\r\nTheir mortal natures, letting go safely by\r\nThe divine Desdemona.\r\n\r\nMONTANO.\r\nWhat is she?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nShe that I spake of, our great captain’s captain,\r\nLeft in the conduct of the bold Iago;\r\nWhose footing here anticipates our thoughts\r\nA se’nnight’s speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,\r\nAnd swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,\r\nThat he may bless this bay with his tall ship,\r\nMake love’s quick pants in Desdemona’s arms,\r\nGive renew’d fire to our extincted spirits,\r\nAnd bring all Cyprus comfort!\r\n\r\nEnter Desdemona, Iago, Roderigo, and Emilia.\r\n\r\nO, behold,\r\nThe riches of the ship is come on shore!\r\nYe men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.\r\nHail to thee, lady! and the grace of heaven,\r\nBefore, behind thee, and on every hand,\r\nEnwheel thee round!\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nI thank you, valiant Cassio.\r\nWhat tidings can you tell me of my lord?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nHe is not yet arrived, nor know I aught\r\nBut that he’s well, and will be shortly here.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nO, but I fear—How lost you company?\r\n\r\n[_Within._] A sail, a sail!\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nThe great contention of the sea and skies\r\nParted our fellowship. But, hark! a sail.\r\n\r\n[_Guns within._]\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\r\nThey give their greeting to the citadel.\r\nThis likewise is a friend.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nSee for the news.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Gentleman._]\r\n\r\nGood ancient, you are welcome. [_To Emilia._] Welcome, mistress.\r\nLet it not gall your patience, good Iago,\r\nThat I extend my manners; ’tis my breeding\r\nThat gives me this bold show of courtesy.\r\n\r\n[_Kissing her._]\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nSir, would she give you so much of her lips\r\nAs of her tongue she oft bestows on me,\r\nYou would have enough.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nAlas, she has no speech.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nIn faith, too much.\r\nI find it still when I have list to sleep.\r\nMarry, before your ladyship, I grant,\r\nShe puts her tongue a little in her heart,\r\nAnd chides with thinking.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nYou have little cause to say so.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nCome on, come on; you are pictures out of doors,\r\nBells in your parlours, wild-cats in your kitchens,\r\nSaints in your injuries, devils being offended,\r\nPlayers in your housewifery, and housewives in your beds.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nO, fie upon thee, slanderer!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nNay, it is true, or else I am a Turk.\r\nYou rise to play, and go to bed to work.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nYou shall not write my praise.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nNo, let me not.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nWhat wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst praise me?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nO gentle lady, do not put me to’t,\r\nFor I am nothing if not critical.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nCome on, assay.—There’s one gone to the harbour?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nAy, madam.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nI am not merry, but I do beguile\r\nThe thing I am, by seeming otherwise.—\r\nCome, how wouldst thou praise me?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI am about it, but indeed, my invention\r\nComes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze,\r\nIt plucks out brains and all: but my Muse labours,\r\nAnd thus she is deliver’d.\r\nIf she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,\r\nThe one’s for use, the other useth it.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nWell prais’d! How if she be black and witty?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nIf she be black, and thereto have a wit,\r\nShe’ll find a white that shall her blackness fit.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nWorse and worse.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nHow if fair and foolish?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nShe never yet was foolish that was fair,\r\nFor even her folly help’d her to an heir.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nThese are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i’ the alehouse. What\r\nmiserable praise hast thou for her that’s foul and foolish?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nThere’s none so foul and foolish thereunto,\r\nBut does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nO heavy ignorance! Thou praisest the worst best. But what praise\r\ncouldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed, one that in the\r\nauthority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice\r\nitself?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nShe that was ever fair and never proud,\r\nHad tongue at will and yet was never loud,\r\nNever lack’d gold and yet went never gay,\r\nFled from her wish, and yet said, “Now I may”;\r\nShe that, being anger’d, her revenge being nigh,\r\nBade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly;\r\nShe that in wisdom never was so frail\r\nTo change the cod’s head for the salmon’s tail;\r\nShe that could think and ne’er disclose her mind,\r\nSee suitors following and not look behind;\r\nShe was a wight, if ever such wight were—\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nTo do what?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nTo suckle fools and chronicle small beer.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nO most lame and impotent conclusion!—Do not learn of him, Emilia,\r\nthough he be thy husband.—How say you, Cassio? is he not a most profane\r\nand liberal counsellor?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nHe speaks home, madam. You may relish him more in the soldier than in\r\nthe scholar.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\n[_Aside._] He takes her by the palm. Ay, well said, whisper. With as\r\nlittle a web as this will I ensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile\r\nupon her, do. I will gyve thee in thine own courtship. You say true,\r\n’tis so, indeed. If such tricks as these strip you out of your\r\nlieutenantry, it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers\r\nso oft, which now again you are most apt to play the sir in. Very good;\r\nwell kissed, an excellent courtesy! ’Tis so, indeed. Yet again your\r\nfingers to your lips? Would they were clyster-pipes for your sake!\r\n\r\n[_Trumpets within._]\r\n\r\nThe Moor! I know his trumpet.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\n’Tis truly so.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nLet’s meet him, and receive him.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nLo, where he comes!\r\n\r\nEnter Othello and Attendants.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nO my fair warrior!\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nMy dear Othello!\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nIt gives me wonder great as my content\r\nTo see you here before me. O my soul’s joy!\r\nIf after every tempest come such calms,\r\nMay the winds blow till they have waken’d death!\r\nAnd let the labouring bark climb hills of seas\r\nOlympus-high, and duck again as low\r\nAs hell’s from heaven! If it were now to die,\r\n’Twere now to be most happy, for I fear\r\nMy soul hath her content so absolute\r\nThat not another comfort like to this\r\nSucceeds in unknown fate.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nThe heavens forbid\r\nBut that our loves and comforts should increase\r\nEven as our days do grow!\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nAmen to that, sweet powers!\r\nI cannot speak enough of this content.\r\nIt stops me here; it is too much of joy:\r\nAnd this, and this, the greatest discords be [_They kiss._]\r\nThat e’er our hearts shall make!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\n[_Aside._] O, you are well tun’d now,\r\nBut I’ll set down the pegs that make this music,\r\nAs honest as I am.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nCome, let us to the castle.—\r\nNews, friends, our wars are done, the Turks are drown’d.\r\nHow does my old acquaintance of this isle?\r\nHoney, you shall be well desir’d in Cyprus;\r\nI have found great love amongst them. O my sweet,\r\nI prattle out of fashion, and I dote\r\nIn mine own comforts.—I prithee, good Iago,\r\nGo to the bay and disembark my coffers.\r\nBring thou the master to the citadel;\r\nHe is a good one, and his worthiness\r\nDoes challenge much respect.—Come, Desdemona,\r\nOnce more well met at Cyprus.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Othello, Desdemona and Attendants._]\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nDo thou meet me presently at the harbour. Come hither. If thou be’st\r\nvaliant—as, they say, base men being in love have then a nobility in\r\ntheir natures more than is native to them—list me. The lieutenant\r\ntonight watches on the court of guard: first, I must tell thee this:\r\nDesdemona is directly in love with him.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nWith him? Why, ’tis not possible.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nLay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed. Mark me with what\r\nviolence she first loved the Moor, but for bragging, and telling her\r\nfantastical lies. And will she love him still for prating? Let not thy\r\ndiscreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed. And what delight shall\r\nshe have to look on the devil? When the blood is made dull with the act\r\nof sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to give satiety a\r\nfresh appetite, loveliness in favour, sympathy in years, manners, and\r\nbeauties; all which the Moor is defective in: now, for want of these\r\nrequired conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself abused,\r\nbegin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor, very nature\r\nwill instruct her in it, and compel her to some second choice. Now sir,\r\nthis granted (as it is a most pregnant and unforced position) who\r\nstands so eminently in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does? a\r\nknave very voluble; no further conscionable than in putting on the mere\r\nform of civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing of his salt\r\nand most hidden loose affection? Why, none, why, none! A slipper and\r\nsubtle knave, a finder out of occasions; that has an eye can stamp and\r\ncounterfeit advantages, though true advantage never present itself: a\r\ndevilish knave! Besides, the knave is handsome, young, and hath all\r\nthose requisites in him that folly and green minds look after. A\r\npestilent complete knave, and the woman hath found him already.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nI cannot believe that in her, she is full of most blessed condition.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nBlest fig’s end! the wine she drinks is made of grapes: if she had been\r\nblessed, she would never have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst\r\nthou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? Didst not mark that?\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nYes, that I did. But that was but courtesy.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nLechery, by this hand. An index and obscure prologue to the history of\r\nlust and foul thoughts. They met so near with their lips that their\r\nbreaths embrac’d together. Villainous thoughts, Roderigo! When these\r\nmutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes the master and main\r\nexercise, the incorporate conclusion. Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by\r\nme. I have brought you from Venice. Watch you tonight. For the command,\r\nI’ll lay’t upon you. Cassio knows you not. I’ll not be far from you. Do\r\nyou find some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or\r\ntainting his discipline, or from what other course you please, which\r\nthe time shall more favourably minister.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nWell.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nSir, he is rash, and very sudden in choler, and haply with his\r\ntruncheon may strike at you: provoke him that he may, for even out of\r\nthat will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny, whose qualification shall\r\ncome into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So\r\nshall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I shall\r\nthen have to prefer them, and the impediment most profitably removed,\r\nwithout the which there were no expectation of our prosperity.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nI will do this, if I can bring it to any opportunity.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel: I must fetch his\r\nnecessaries ashore. Farewell.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nAdieu.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nThat Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;\r\nThat she loves him, ’tis apt, and of great credit:\r\nThe Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,\r\nIs of a constant, loving, noble nature;\r\nAnd, I dare think, he’ll prove to Desdemona\r\nA most dear husband. Now, I do love her too,\r\nNot out of absolute lust (though peradventure\r\nI stand accountant for as great a sin)\r\nBut partly led to diet my revenge,\r\nFor that I do suspect the lusty Moor\r\nHath leap’d into my seat. The thought whereof\r\nDoth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards,\r\nAnd nothing can or shall content my soul\r\nTill I am even’d with him, wife for wife,\r\nOr, failing so, yet that I put the Moor\r\nAt least into a jealousy so strong\r\nThat judgement cannot cure. Which thing to do,\r\nIf this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash\r\nFor his quick hunting, stand the putting on,\r\nI’ll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,\r\nAbuse him to the Moor in the rank garb\r\n(For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too)\r\nMake the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me\r\nFor making him egregiously an ass\r\nAnd practicing upon his peace and quiet\r\nEven to madness. ’Tis here, but yet confus’d.\r\nKnavery’s plain face is never seen till us’d.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. A street.\r\n\r\nEnter Othello’s Herald with a proclamation.\r\n\r\nHERALD.\r\nIt is Othello’s pleasure, our noble and valiant general, that upon\r\ncertain tidings now arrived, importing the mere perdition of the\r\nTurkish fleet, every man put himself into triumph: some to dance, some\r\nto make bonfires, each man to what sport and revels his addition leads\r\nhim. For besides these beneficial news, it is the celebration of his\r\nnuptial. So much was his pleasure should be proclaimed. All offices are\r\nopen, and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of\r\nfive till the bell have told eleven. Heaven bless the isle of Cyprus\r\nand our noble general Othello!\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. A Hall in the Castle.\r\n\r\nEnter Othello, Desdemona, Cassio and Attendants.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nGood Michael, look you to the guard tonight.\r\nLet’s teach ourselves that honourable stop,\r\nNot to outsport discretion.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nIago hath direction what to do.\r\nBut notwithstanding with my personal eye\r\nWill I look to’t.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nIago is most honest.\r\nMichael, good night. Tomorrow with your earliest\r\nLet me have speech with you. [_To Desdemona._] Come, my dear love,\r\nThe purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;\r\nThat profit’s yet to come ’tween me and you.—\r\nGood night.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Othello, Desdemona and Attendants._]\r\n\r\nEnter Iago.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nWelcome, Iago. We must to the watch.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nNot this hour, lieutenant. ’Tis not yet ten o’ th’ clock. Our general\r\ncast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona; who let us not\r\ntherefore blame: he hath not yet made wanton the night with her; and\r\nshe is sport for Jove.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nShe’s a most exquisite lady.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nAnd, I’ll warrant her, full of game.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nIndeed, she is a most fresh and delicate creature.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhat an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley to provocation.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nAn inviting eye, and yet methinks right modest.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nAnd when she speaks, is it not an alarm to love?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nShe is indeed perfection.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWell, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I have a stoup of\r\nwine; and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants that would fain\r\nhave a measure to the health of black Othello.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nNot tonight, good Iago. I have very poor and unhappy brains for\r\ndrinking. I could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of\r\nentertainment.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nO, they are our friends; but one cup: I’ll drink for you.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nI have drunk but one cup tonight, and that was craftily qualified too,\r\nand behold, what innovation it makes here: I am unfortunate in the\r\ninfirmity, and dare not task my weakness with any more.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhat, man! ’Tis a night of revels. The gallants desire it.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nWhere are they?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nHere at the door. I pray you, call them in.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nI’ll do’t; but it dislikes me.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nIf I can fasten but one cup upon him,\r\nWith that which he hath drunk tonight already,\r\nHe’ll be as full of quarrel and offence\r\nAs my young mistress’ dog. Now my sick fool Roderigo,\r\nWhom love hath turn’d almost the wrong side out,\r\nTo Desdemona hath tonight carous’d\r\nPotations pottle-deep; and he’s to watch:\r\nThree lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,\r\nThat hold their honours in a wary distance,\r\nThe very elements of this warlike isle,\r\nHave I tonight fluster’d with flowing cups,\r\nAnd they watch too. Now, ’mongst this flock of drunkards,\r\nAm I to put our Cassio in some action\r\nThat may offend the isle. But here they come:\r\nIf consequence do but approve my dream,\r\nMy boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.\r\n\r\nEnter Cassio, Montano and Gentlemen; followed by Servant with wine.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\n’Fore God, they have given me a rouse already.\r\n\r\nMONTANO.\r\nGood faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I am a soldier.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nSome wine, ho!\r\n[_Sings._]\r\n\r\n _And let me the cannikin clink, clink,\r\n And let me the cannikin clink, clink:\r\n A soldier’s a man,\r\n O, man’s life’s but a span,\r\n Why then let a soldier drink._\r\n\r\nSome wine, boys!\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\n’Fore God, an excellent song.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI learned it in England, where indeed they are most potent in potting:\r\nyour Dane, your German, and your swag-bellied Hollander,—drink, ho!—are\r\nnothing to your English.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nIs your Englishman so expert in his drinking?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhy, he drinks you, with facility, your Dane dead drunk; he sweats not\r\nto overthrow your Almain; he gives your Hollander a vomit ere the next\r\npottle can be filled.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nTo the health of our general!\r\n\r\nMONTANO.\r\nI am for it, lieutenant; and I’ll do you justice.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nO sweet England!\r\n\r\n[_Sings._]\r\n\r\n _King Stephen was a worthy peer,\r\n His breeches cost him but a crown;\r\n He held them sixpence all too dear,\r\n With that he call’d the tailor lown.\r\n He was a wight of high renown,\r\n And thou art but of low degree:\r\n ’Tis pride that pulls the country down,\r\n Then take thine auld cloak about thee._\r\n\r\nSome wine, ho!\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\n’Fore God, this is a more exquisite song than the other.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWill you hear ’t again?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nNo, for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things.\r\nWell, God’s above all, and there be souls must be saved, and there be\r\nsouls must not be saved.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nIt’s true, good lieutenant.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nFor mine own part, no offence to the general, nor any man of quality, I\r\nhope to be saved.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nAnd so do I too, lieutenant.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nAy, but, by your leave, not before me; the lieutenant is to be saved\r\nbefore the ancient. Let’s have no more of this; let’s to our affairs.\r\nForgive us our sins! Gentlemen, let’s look to our business. Do not\r\nthink, gentlemen, I am drunk. This is my ancient, this is my right\r\nhand, and this is my left. I am not drunk now. I can stand well enough,\r\nand I speak well enough.\r\n\r\nALL.\r\nExcellent well.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nWhy, very well then. You must not think, then, that I am drunk.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nMONTANO.\r\nTo the platform, masters. Come, let’s set the watch.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nYou see this fellow that is gone before,\r\nHe is a soldier fit to stand by Cæsar\r\nAnd give direction: and do but see his vice,\r\n’Tis to his virtue a just equinox,\r\nThe one as long as th’ other. ’Tis pity of him.\r\nI fear the trust Othello puts him in,\r\nOn some odd time of his infirmity,\r\nWill shake this island.\r\n\r\nMONTANO.\r\nBut is he often thus?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\n’Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep:\r\nHe’ll watch the horologe a double set\r\nIf drink rock not his cradle.\r\n\r\nMONTANO.\r\nIt were well\r\nThe general were put in mind of it.\r\nPerhaps he sees it not, or his good nature\r\nPrizes the virtue that appears in Cassio,\r\nAnd looks not on his evils: is not this true?\r\n\r\nEnter Roderigo.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\n[_Aside to him._] How now, Roderigo?\r\nI pray you, after the lieutenant; go.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Roderigo._]\r\n\r\nMONTANO.\r\nAnd ’tis great pity that the noble Moor\r\nShould hazard such a place as his own second\r\nWith one of an ingraft infirmity:\r\nIt were an honest action to say so\r\nTo the Moor.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nNot I, for this fair island.\r\nI do love Cassio well and would do much\r\nTo cure him of this evil. But, hark! What noise?\r\n\r\n[_Cry within_: “Help! help!”]\r\n\r\nEnter Cassio, driving in Roderigo.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nZounds, you rogue, you rascal!\r\n\r\nMONTANO.\r\nWhat’s the matter, lieutenant?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nA knave teach me my duty! I’ll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nBeat me?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nDost thou prate, rogue?\r\n\r\n[_Striking Roderigo._]\r\n\r\nMONTANO.\r\nNay, good lieutenant;\r\nI pray you, sir, hold your hand.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nLet me go, sir,\r\nOr I’ll knock you o’er the mazard.\r\n\r\nMONTANO.\r\nCome, come, you’re drunk.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nDrunk?\r\n\r\n[_They fight._]\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\n[_Aside to Roderigo._] Away, I say! Go out and cry a mutiny.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Roderigo._]\r\n\r\nNay, good lieutenant, God’s will, gentlemen.\r\nHelp, ho!—Lieutenant,—sir,—Montano,—sir:—\r\nHelp, masters! Here’s a goodly watch indeed!\r\n\r\n[_A bell rings._]\r\n\r\nWho’s that which rings the bell?—Diablo, ho!\r\nThe town will rise. God’s will, lieutenant, hold,\r\nYou will be sham’d forever.\r\n\r\nEnter Othello and Attendants.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWhat is the matter here?\r\n\r\nMONTANO.\r\nZounds, I bleed still, I am hurt to the death.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nHold, for your lives!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nHold, ho! lieutenant,—sir,—Montano,—gentlemen,—\r\nHave you forgot all place of sense and duty?\r\nHold! The general speaks to you; hold, hold, for shame!\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWhy, how now, ho! From whence ariseth this?\r\nAre we turn’d Turks, and to ourselves do that\r\nWhich heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?\r\nFor Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl:\r\nHe that stirs next to carve for his own rage\r\nHolds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.\r\nSilence that dreadful bell, it frights the isle\r\nFrom her propriety. What is the matter, masters?\r\nHonest Iago, that looks dead with grieving,\r\nSpeak, who began this? On thy love, I charge thee.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI do not know. Friends all but now, even now,\r\nIn quarter, and in terms like bride and groom\r\nDevesting them for bed; and then, but now,\r\nAs if some planet had unwitted men,\r\nSwords out, and tilting one at other’s breast,\r\nIn opposition bloody. I cannot speak\r\nAny beginning to this peevish odds;\r\nAnd would in action glorious I had lost\r\nThose legs that brought me to a part of it!\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nHow comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nI pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWorthy Montano, you were wont be civil.\r\nThe gravity and stillness of your youth\r\nThe world hath noted, and your name is great\r\nIn mouths of wisest censure: what’s the matter,\r\nThat you unlace your reputation thus,\r\nAnd spend your rich opinion for the name\r\nOf a night-brawler? Give me answer to it.\r\n\r\nMONTANO.\r\nWorthy Othello, I am hurt to danger.\r\nYour officer, Iago, can inform you,\r\nWhile I spare speech, which something now offends me,\r\nOf all that I do know; nor know I aught\r\nBy me that’s said or done amiss this night,\r\nUnless self-charity be sometimes a vice,\r\nAnd to defend ourselves it be a sin\r\nWhen violence assails us.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nNow, by heaven,\r\nMy blood begins my safer guides to rule,\r\nAnd passion, having my best judgement collied,\r\nAssays to lead the way. Zounds, if I stir,\r\nOr do but lift this arm, the best of you\r\nShall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know\r\nHow this foul rout began, who set it on,\r\nAnd he that is approv’d in this offence,\r\nThough he had twinn’d with me, both at a birth,\r\nShall lose me. What! in a town of war,\r\nYet wild, the people’s hearts brimful of fear,\r\nTo manage private and domestic quarrel,\r\nIn night, and on the court and guard of safety?\r\n’Tis monstrous. Iago, who began’t?\r\n\r\nMONTANO.\r\nIf partially affin’d, or leagu’d in office,\r\nThou dost deliver more or less than truth,\r\nThou art no soldier.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nTouch me not so near.\r\nI had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth\r\nThan it should do offence to Michael Cassio.\r\nYet I persuade myself, to speak the truth\r\nShall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general:\r\nMontano and myself being in speech,\r\nThere comes a fellow crying out for help,\r\nAnd Cassio following him with determin’d sword,\r\nTo execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman\r\nSteps in to Cassio and entreats his pause.\r\nMyself the crying fellow did pursue,\r\nLest by his clamour (as it so fell out)\r\nThe town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,\r\nOutran my purpose: and I return’d the rather\r\nFor that I heard the clink and fall of swords,\r\nAnd Cassio high in oath, which till tonight\r\nI ne’er might say before. When I came back,\r\n(For this was brief) I found them close together,\r\nAt blow and thrust, even as again they were\r\nWhen you yourself did part them.\r\nMore of this matter cannot I report.\r\nBut men are men; the best sometimes forget;\r\nThough Cassio did some little wrong to him,\r\nAs men in rage strike those that wish them best,\r\nYet surely Cassio, I believe, receiv’d\r\nFrom him that fled some strange indignity,\r\nWhich patience could not pass.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI know, Iago,\r\nThy honesty and love doth mince this matter,\r\nMaking it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee,\r\nBut never more be officer of mine.\r\n\r\nEnter Desdemona, attended.\r\n\r\nLook, if my gentle love be not rais’d up!\r\nI’ll make thee an example.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nWhat’s the matter?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nAll’s well now, sweeting; come away to bed.\r\nSir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon.\r\nLead him off.\r\n\n[_Montano is led off._]\r\n\r\nIago, look with care about the town,\r\nAnd silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.\r\nCome, Desdemona: ’tis the soldiers’ life\r\nTo have their balmy slumbers wak’d with strife.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt all but Iago and Cassio._]\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhat, are you hurt, lieutenant?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nAy, past all surgery.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nMarry, Heaven forbid!\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nReputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost my reputation! I\r\nhave lost the immortal part of myself, and what remains is bestial. My\r\nreputation, Iago, my reputation!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nAs I am an honest man, I thought you had received some bodily wound;\r\nthere is more sense in that than in reputation. Reputation is an idle\r\nand most false imposition, oft got without merit and lost without\r\ndeserving. You have lost no reputation at all, unless you repute\r\nyourself such a loser. What, man, there are ways to recover the general\r\nagain: you are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in policy\r\nthan in malice, even so as one would beat his offenceless dog to\r\naffright an imperious lion: sue to him again, and he’s yours.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nI will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander\r\nwith so slight, so drunken, and so indiscreet an officer. Drunk? and\r\nspeak parrot? and squabble? swagger? swear? and discourse fustian with\r\none’s own shadow? O thou invisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no name\r\nto be known by, let us call thee devil!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhat was he that you followed with your sword? What had he done to you?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nI know not.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nIs’t possible?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nI remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; a quarrel, but\r\nnothing wherefore. O God, that men should put an enemy in their mouths\r\nto steal away their brains! That we should with joy, pleasance, revel,\r\nand applause, transform ourselves into beasts!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhy, but you are now well enough: how came you thus recovered?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nIt hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath.\r\nOne unperfectness shows me another, to make me frankly despise myself.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nCome, you are too severe a moraler. As the time, the place, and the\r\ncondition of this country stands, I could heartily wish this had not\r\nbefallen; but since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nI will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me I am a drunkard!\r\nHad I as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would stop them all. To\r\nbe now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast! O\r\nstrange! Every inordinate cup is unbless’d, and the ingredient is a\r\ndevil.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nCome, come, good wine is a good familiar creature, if it be well used.\r\nExclaim no more against it. And, good lieutenant, I think you think I\r\nlove you.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nI have well approved it, sir.—I drunk!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nYou, or any man living, may be drunk at a time, man. I’ll tell you what\r\nyou shall do. Our general’s wife is now the general; I may say so in\r\nthis respect, for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the\r\ncontemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and graces. Confess\r\nyourself freely to her. Importune her help to put you in your place\r\nagain. She is of so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition,\r\nshe holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is\r\nrequested. This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to\r\nsplinter, and, my fortunes against any lay worth naming, this crack of\r\nyour love shall grow stronger than it was before.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nYou advise me well.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nI think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will beseech the\r\nvirtuous Desdemona to undertake for me; I am desperate of my fortunes\r\nif they check me here.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nYou are in the right. Good night, lieutenant, I must to the watch.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nGood night, honest Iago.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nAnd what’s he then, that says I play the villain?\r\nWhen this advice is free I give and honest,\r\nProbal to thinking, and indeed the course\r\nTo win the Moor again? For ’tis most easy\r\nThe inclining Desdemona to subdue\r\nIn any honest suit. She’s fram’d as fruitful\r\nAs the free elements. And then for her\r\nTo win the Moor, were’t to renounce his baptism,\r\nAll seals and symbols of redeemed sin,\r\nHis soul is so enfetter’d to her love\r\nThat she may make, unmake, do what she list,\r\nEven as her appetite shall play the god\r\nWith his weak function. How am I then, a villain\r\nTo counsel Cassio to this parallel course,\r\nDirectly to his good? Divinity of hell!\r\nWhen devils will the blackest sins put on,\r\nThey do suggest at first with heavenly shows,\r\nAs I do now: for whiles this honest fool\r\nPlies Desdemona to repair his fortune,\r\nAnd she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,\r\nI’ll pour this pestilence into his ear,\r\nThat she repeals him for her body’s lust;\r\nAnd by how much she strives to do him good,\r\nShe shall undo her credit with the Moor.\r\nSo will I turn her virtue into pitch,\r\nAnd out of her own goodness make the net\r\nThat shall enmesh them all.\r\n\r\nEnter Roderigo.\r\n\r\nHow now, Roderigo?\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nI do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that hunts, but one\r\nthat fills up the cry. My money is almost spent, I have been tonight\r\nexceedingly well cudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shall have\r\nso much experience for my pains, and so, with no money at all and a\r\nlittle more wit, return again to Venice.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nHow poor are they that have not patience!\r\nWhat wound did ever heal but by degrees?\r\nThou know’st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft,\r\nAnd wit depends on dilatory time.\r\nDoes’t not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,\r\nAnd thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier’d Cassio;\r\nThough other things grow fair against the sun,\r\nYet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe.\r\nContent thyself awhile. By the mass, ’tis morning;\r\nPleasure and action make the hours seem short.\r\nRetire thee; go where thou art billeted.\r\nAway, I say, thou shalt know more hereafter.\r\nNay, get thee gone.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Roderigo._]\r\n\r\nTwo things are to be done,\r\nMy wife must move for Cassio to her mistress.\r\nI’ll set her on;\r\nMyself the while to draw the Moor apart,\r\nAnd bring him jump when he may Cassio find\r\nSoliciting his wife. Ay, that’s the way.\r\nDull not device by coldness and delay.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\nACT III\r\n\r\nSCENE I. Cyprus. Before the Castle.\r\n\nEnter Cassio and some Musicians.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nMasters, play here, I will content your pains,\r\nSomething that’s brief; and bid “Good morrow, general.”\r\n\r\n[_Music._]\r\n\r\nEnter Clown.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWhy, masters, have your instruments been in Naples, that they speak i’\r\nthe nose thus?\r\n\r\nFIRST MUSICIAN.\r\nHow, sir, how?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nAre these, I pray you, wind instruments?\r\n\r\nFIRST MUSICIAN.\r\nAy, marry, are they, sir.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nO, thereby hangs a tail.\r\n\r\nFIRST MUSICIAN.\r\nWhereby hangs a tale, sir?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nMarry, sir, by many a wind instrument that I know. But, masters, here’s\r\nmoney for you: and the general so likes your music, that he desires\r\nyou, for love’s sake, to make no more noise with it.\r\n\r\nFIRST MUSICIAN.\r\nWell, sir, we will not.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nIf you have any music that may not be heard, to’t again. But, as they\r\nsay, to hear music the general does not greatly care.\r\n\r\nFIRST MUSICIAN.\r\nWe have none such, sir.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nThen put up your pipes in your bag, for I’ll away. Go, vanish into air,\r\naway!\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Musicians._]\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nDost thou hear, mine honest friend?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNo, I hear not your honest friend. I hear you.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nPrithee, keep up thy quillets. There’s a poor piece of gold for thee:\r\nif the gentlewoman that attends the general’s wife be stirring, tell\r\nher there’s one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech. Wilt\r\nthou do this?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nShe is stirring, sir; if she will stir hither, I shall seem to notify\r\nunto her.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nDo, good my friend.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Clown._]\r\n\r\nEnter Iago.\r\n\r\nIn happy time, Iago.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nYou have not been a-bed, then?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nWhy, no. The day had broke\r\nBefore we parted. I have made bold, Iago,\r\nTo send in to your wife. My suit to her\r\nIs, that she will to virtuous Desdemona\r\nProcure me some access.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI’ll send her to you presently,\r\nAnd I’ll devise a mean to draw the Moor\r\nOut of the way, that your converse and business\r\nMay be more free.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nI humbly thank you for’t.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Iago._]\r\n\r\nI never knew\r\nA Florentine more kind and honest.\r\n\r\nEnter Emilia.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nGood morrow, good lieutenant; I am sorry\r\nFor your displeasure, but all will sure be well.\r\nThe general and his wife are talking of it,\r\nAnd she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies\r\nThat he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus\r\nAnd great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom\r\nHe might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you\r\nAnd needs no other suitor but his likings\r\nTo take the safest occasion by the front\r\nTo bring you in again.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nYet, I beseech you,\r\nIf you think fit, or that it may be done,\r\nGive me advantage of some brief discourse\r\nWith Desdemona alone.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nPray you, come in.\r\nI will bestow you where you shall have time\r\nTo speak your bosom freely.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nI am much bound to you.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II.

I warrant it grieves my husband\r\nAs if the cause were his.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nO, that’s an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,\r\nBut I will have my lord and you again\r\nAs friendly as you were.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nBounteous madam,\r\nWhatever shall become of Michael Cassio,\r\nHe’s never anything but your true servant.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nI know’t. I thank you. You do love my lord.\r\nYou have known him long; and be you well assur’d\r\nHe shall in strangeness stand no farther off\r\nThan in a politic distance.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nAy, but, lady,\r\nThat policy may either last so long,\r\nOr feed upon such nice and waterish diet,\r\nOr breed itself so out of circumstance,\r\nThat, I being absent, and my place supplied,\r\nMy general will forget my love and service.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nDo not doubt that. Before Emilia here\r\nI give thee warrant of thy place. Assure thee,\r\nIf I do vow a friendship, I’ll perform it\r\nTo the last article. My lord shall never rest,\r\nI’ll watch him tame, and talk him out of patience;\r\nHis bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;\r\nI’ll intermingle everything he does\r\nWith Cassio’s suit. Therefore be merry, Cassio,\r\nFor thy solicitor shall rather die\r\nThan give thy cause away.\r\n\r\nEnter Othello and Iago.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nMadam, here comes my lord.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nMadam, I’ll take my leave.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nWhy, stay, and hear me speak.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nMadam, not now. I am very ill at ease,\r\nUnfit for mine own purposes.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nWell, do your discretion.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Cassio._]\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nHa, I like not that.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWhat dost thou say?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nNothing, my lord; or if—I know not what.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWas not that Cassio parted from my wife?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nCassio, my lord? No, sure, I cannot think it,\r\nThat he would steal away so guilty-like,\r\nSeeing you coming.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI do believe ’twas he.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nHow now, my lord?\r\nI have been talking with a suitor here,\r\nA man that languishes in your displeasure.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWho is’t you mean?\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nWhy, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,\r\nIf I have any grace or power to move you,\r\nHis present reconciliation take;\r\nFor if he be not one that truly loves you,\r\nThat errs in ignorance and not in cunning,\r\nI have no judgement in an honest face.\r\nI prithee call him back.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWent he hence now?\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nAy, sooth; so humbled\r\nThat he hath left part of his grief with me\r\nTo suffer with him. Good love, call him back.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nNot now, sweet Desdemon, some other time.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nBut shall’t be shortly?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nThe sooner, sweet, for you.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nShall’t be tonight at supper?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nNo, not tonight.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nTomorrow dinner then?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI shall not dine at home;\r\nI meet the captains at the citadel.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nWhy then tomorrow night, or Tuesday morn,\r\nOn Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn.\r\nI prithee name the time, but let it not\r\nExceed three days. In faith, he’s penitent;\r\nAnd yet his trespass, in our common reason,\r\n(Save that, they say, the wars must make examples\r\nOut of their best) is not almost a fault\r\nTo incur a private check. When shall he come?\r\nTell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,\r\nWhat you would ask me, that I should deny,\r\nOr stand so mammering on. What? Michael Cassio,\r\nThat came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,\r\nWhen I have spoke of you dispraisingly,\r\nHath ta’en your part, to have so much to do\r\nTo bring him in! Trust me, I could do much.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nPrithee no more. Let him come when he will;\r\nI will deny thee nothing.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nWhy, this is not a boon;\r\n’Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,\r\nOr feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,\r\nOr sue to you to do a peculiar profit\r\nTo your own person: nay, when I have a suit\r\nWherein I mean to touch your love indeed,\r\nIt shall be full of poise and difficult weight,\r\nAnd fearful to be granted.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI will deny thee nothing.\r\nWhereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,\r\nTo leave me but a little to myself.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nShall I deny you? No, farewell, my lord.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nFarewell, my Desdemona. I’ll come to thee straight.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nEmilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you.\r\nWhate’er you be, I am obedient.\r\n\r\n[_Exit with Emilia._]\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nExcellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,\r\nBut I do love thee! And when I love thee not,\r\nChaos is come again.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nMy noble lord,—\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWhat dost thou say, Iago?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nDid Michael Cassio, when you woo’d my lady,\r\nKnow of your love?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nHe did, from first to last. Why dost thou ask?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nBut for a satisfaction of my thought.\r\nNo further harm.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWhy of thy thought, Iago?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI did not think he had been acquainted with her.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nO yes, and went between us very oft.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nIndeed?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nIndeed? Ay, indeed. Discern’st thou aught in that?\r\nIs he not honest?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nHonest, my lord?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nHonest? ay, honest.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nMy lord, for aught I know.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWhat dost thou think?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nThink, my lord?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nThink, my lord? By heaven, he echoes me,\r\nAs if there were some monster in his thought\r\nToo hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something.\r\nI heard thee say even now, thou lik’st not that,\r\nWhen Cassio left my wife. What didst not like?\r\nAnd when I told thee he was of my counsel\r\nIn my whole course of wooing, thou criedst, “Indeed?”\r\nAnd didst contract and purse thy brow together,\r\nAs if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain\r\nSome horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,\r\nShow me thy thought.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nMy lord, you know I love you.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI think thou dost;\r\nAnd for I know thou’rt full of love and honesty\r\nAnd weigh’st thy words before thou giv’st them breath,\r\nTherefore these stops of thine fright me the more:\r\nFor such things in a false disloyal knave\r\nAre tricks of custom; but in a man that’s just,\r\nThey’re close dilations, working from the heart,\r\nThat passion cannot rule.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nFor Michael Cassio,\r\nI dare be sworn I think that he is honest.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI think so too.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nMen should be what they seem;\r\nOr those that be not, would they might seem none!\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nCertain, men should be what they seem.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhy then, I think Cassio’s an honest man.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nNay, yet there’s more in this:\r\nI prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,\r\nAs thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts\r\nThe worst of words.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nGood my lord, pardon me.\r\nThough I am bound to every act of duty,\r\nI am not bound to that all slaves are free to.\r\nUtter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false:\r\nAs where’s that palace whereinto foul things\r\nSometimes intrude not? Who has a breast so pure\r\nBut some uncleanly apprehensions\r\nKeep leets and law-days, and in session sit\r\nWith meditations lawful?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nThou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,\r\nIf thou but think’st him wrong’d and mak’st his ear\r\nA stranger to thy thoughts.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI do beseech you,\r\nThough I perchance am vicious in my guess,\r\nAs, I confess, it is my nature’s plague\r\nTo spy into abuses, and of my jealousy\r\nShapes faults that are not,—that your wisdom\r\nFrom one that so imperfectly conceits,\r\nWould take no notice; nor build yourself a trouble\r\nOut of his scattering and unsure observance.\r\nIt were not for your quiet nor your good,\r\nNor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,\r\nTo let you know my thoughts.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWhat dost thou mean?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nGood name in man and woman, dear my lord,\r\nIs the immediate jewel of their souls.\r\nWho steals my purse steals trash. ’Tis something, nothing;\r\n’Twas mine, ’tis his, and has been slave to thousands.\r\nBut he that filches from me my good name\r\nRobs me of that which not enriches him\r\nAnd makes me poor indeed.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nBy heaven, I’ll know thy thoughts.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nYou cannot, if my heart were in your hand,\r\nNor shall not, whilst ’tis in my custody.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nHa?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nO, beware, my lord, of jealousy;\r\nIt is the green-ey’d monster which doth mock\r\nThe meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss\r\nWho, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;\r\nBut O, what damned minutes tells he o’er\r\nWho dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nO misery!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nPoor and content is rich, and rich enough;\r\nBut riches fineless is as poor as winter\r\nTo him that ever fears he shall be poor.\r\nGood heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend\r\nFrom jealousy!\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWhy, why is this?\r\nThink’st thou I’d make a life of jealousy,\r\nTo follow still the changes of the moon\r\nWith fresh suspicions? No. To be once in doubt\r\nIs once to be resolv’d: exchange me for a goat\r\nWhen I shall turn the business of my soul\r\nTo such exsufflicate and blown surmises,\r\nMatching thy inference. ’Tis not to make me jealous,\r\nTo say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,\r\nIs free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well;\r\nWhere virtue is, these are more virtuous:\r\nNor from mine own weak merits will I draw\r\nThe smallest fear or doubt of her revolt,\r\nFor she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago,\r\nI’ll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;\r\nAnd on the proof, there is no more but this:\r\nAway at once with love or jealousy!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI am glad of it, for now I shall have reason\r\nTo show the love and duty that I bear you\r\nWith franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,\r\nReceive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.\r\nLook to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;\r\nWear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure.\r\nI would not have your free and noble nature,\r\nOut of self-bounty, be abus’d. Look to’t.\r\nI know our country disposition well;\r\nIn Venice they do let heaven see the pranks\r\nThey dare not show their husbands. Their best conscience\r\nIs not to leave undone, but keep unknown.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nDost thou say so?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nShe did deceive her father, marrying you;\r\nAnd when she seem’d to shake and fear your looks,\r\nShe loved them most.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nAnd so she did.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhy, go to then.\r\nShe that so young could give out such a seeming,\r\nTo seal her father’s eyes up close as oak,\r\nHe thought ’twas witchcraft. But I am much to blame.\r\nI humbly do beseech you of your pardon\r\nFor too much loving you.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI am bound to thee for ever.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI see this hath a little dash’d your spirits.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nNot a jot, not a jot.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nTrust me, I fear it has.\r\nI hope you will consider what is spoke\r\nComes from my love. But I do see you’re mov’d.\r\nI am to pray you not to strain my speech\r\nTo grosser issues nor to larger reach\r\nThan to suspicion.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI will not.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nShould you do so, my lord,\r\nMy speech should fall into such vile success\r\nWhich my thoughts aim’d not. Cassio’s my worthy friend.\r\nMy lord, I see you’re mov’d.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nNo, not much mov’d.\r\nI do not think but Desdemona’s honest.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nLong live she so! And long live you to think so!\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nAnd yet, how nature erring from itself—\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nAy, there’s the point. As, to be bold with you,\r\nNot to affect many proposed matches,\r\nOf her own clime, complexion, and degree,\r\nWhereto we see in all things nature tends;\r\nFoh! One may smell in such a will most rank,\r\nFoul disproportion, thoughts unnatural.\r\nBut pardon me: I do not in position\r\nDistinctly speak of her, though I may fear\r\nHer will, recoiling to her better judgement,\r\nMay fall to match you with her country forms,\r\nAnd happily repent.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nFarewell, farewell:\r\nIf more thou dost perceive, let me know more;\r\nSet on thy wife to observe. Leave me, Iago.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\n[_Going._] My lord, I take my leave.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWhy did I marry? This honest creature doubtless\r\nSees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\n[_Returning._] My lord, I would I might entreat your honour\r\nTo scan this thing no further. Leave it to time:\r\nThough it be fit that Cassio have his place,\r\nFor sure he fills it up with great ability,\r\nYet if you please to hold him off awhile,\r\nYou shall by that perceive him and his means.\r\nNote if your lady strain his entertainment\r\nWith any strong or vehement importunity,\r\nMuch will be seen in that. In the meantime,\r\nLet me be thought too busy in my fears\r\n(As worthy cause I have to fear I am)\r\nAnd hold her free, I do beseech your honour.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nFear not my government.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI once more take my leave.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nThis fellow’s of exceeding honesty,\r\nAnd knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,\r\nOf human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,\r\nThough that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,\r\nI’d whistle her off, and let her down the wind\r\nTo prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black,\r\nAnd have not those soft parts of conversation\r\nThat chamberers have, or for I am declin’d\r\nInto the vale of years,—yet that’s not much—\r\nShe’s gone, I am abus’d, and my relief\r\nMust be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,\r\nThat we can call these delicate creatures ours,\r\nAnd not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,\r\nAnd live upon the vapour of a dungeon,\r\nThan keep a corner in the thing I love\r\nFor others’ uses. Yet, ’tis the plague of great ones,\r\nPrerogativ’d are they less than the base,\r\n’Tis destiny unshunnable, like death:\r\nEven then this forked plague is fated to us\r\nWhen we do quicken. Desdemona comes.\r\nIf she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself!\r\nI’ll not believe’t.\r\n\r\nEnter Desdemona and Emilia.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nHow now, my dear Othello?\r\nYour dinner, and the generous islanders\r\nBy you invited, do attend your presence.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI am to blame.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nWhy do you speak so faintly?\r\nAre you not well?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI have a pain upon my forehead here.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nFaith, that’s with watching, ’twill away again;\r\nLet me but bind it hard, within this hour\r\nIt will be well.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nYour napkin is too little;\r\n\r\n[_He puts the handkerchief from him, and she drops it._]\r\n\r\nLet it alone. Come, I’ll go in with you.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nI am very sorry that you are not well.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Othello and Desdemona._]\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nI am glad I have found this napkin;\r\nThis was her first remembrance from the Moor.\r\nMy wayward husband hath a hundred times\r\nWoo’d me to steal it. But she so loves the token,\r\nFor he conjur’d her she should ever keep it,\r\nThat she reserves it evermore about her\r\nTo kiss and talk to. I’ll have the work ta’en out,\r\nAnd give’t Iago. What he will do with it\r\nHeaven knows, not I,\r\nI nothing but to please his fantasy.\r\n\r\nEnter Iago.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nHow now? What do you here alone?\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nDo not you chide. I have a thing for you.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nA thing for me? It is a common thing—\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nHa?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nTo have a foolish wife.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nO, is that all? What will you give me now\r\nFor that same handkerchief?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhat handkerchief?\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nWhat handkerchief?\r\nWhy, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona,\r\nThat which so often you did bid me steal.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nHast stol’n it from her?\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nNo, faith, she let it drop by negligence,\r\nAnd, to the advantage, I being here, took ’t up.\r\nLook, here it is.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nA good wench, give it me.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nWhat will you do with’t, that you have been so earnest\r\nTo have me filch it?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\n[_Snatching it._] Why, what’s that to you?\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nIf it be not for some purpose of import,\r\nGive ’t me again. Poor lady, she’ll run mad\r\nWhen she shall lack it.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nBe not acknown on’t, I have use for it.\r\nGo, leave me.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Emilia._]\r\n\r\nI will in Cassio’s lodging lose this napkin,\r\nAnd let him find it. Trifles light as air\r\nAre to the jealous confirmations strong\r\nAs proofs of holy writ. This may do something.\r\nThe Moor already changes with my poison:\r\nDangerous conceits are in their natures poisons,\r\nWhich at the first are scarce found to distaste,\r\nBut with a little act upon the blood\r\nBurn like the mines of sulphur. I did say so.\r\n\r\nEnter Othello.\r\n\r\nLook, where he comes. Not poppy, nor mandragora,\r\nNor all the drowsy syrups of the world,\r\nShall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep\r\nWhich thou ow’dst yesterday.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nHa! ha! false to me?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhy, how now, general? No more of that.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nAvaunt! be gone! Thou hast set me on the rack.\r\nI swear ’tis better to be much abus’d\r\nThan but to know’t a little.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nHow now, my lord?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWhat sense had I of her stol’n hours of lust?\r\nI saw’t not, thought it not, it harm’d not me.\r\nI slept the next night well, was free and merry;\r\nI found not Cassio’s kisses on her lips.\r\nHe that is robb’d, not wanting what is stol’n,\r\nLet him not know’t, and he’s not robb’d at all.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI am sorry to hear this.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI had been happy if the general camp,\r\nPioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,\r\nSo I had nothing known. O, now, for ever\r\nFarewell the tranquil mind! Farewell content!\r\nFarewell the plumed troops and the big wars\r\nThat make ambition virtue! O, farewell,\r\nFarewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump,\r\nThe spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,\r\nThe royal banner, and all quality,\r\nPride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war!\r\nAnd, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats\r\nThe immortal Jove’s dread clamours counterfeit,\r\nFarewell! Othello’s occupation’s gone!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nIs’t possible, my lord?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nVillain, be sure thou prove my love a whore;\r\nBe sure of it. Give me the ocular proof,\r\nOr, by the worth of man’s eternal soul,\r\nThou hadst been better have been born a dog\r\nThan answer my wak’d wrath.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nIs’t come to this?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nMake me to see’t, or at the least so prove it,\r\nThat the probation bear no hinge nor loop\r\nTo hang a doubt on, or woe upon thy life!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nMy noble lord,—\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nIf thou dost slander her and torture me,\r\nNever pray more. Abandon all remorse;\r\nOn horror’s head horrors accumulate;\r\nDo deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amaz’d;\r\nFor nothing canst thou to damnation add\r\nGreater than that.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nO grace! O heaven defend me!\r\nAre you a man? Have you a soul or sense?\r\nGod be wi’ you. Take mine office.—O wretched fool,\r\nThat liv’st to make thine honesty a vice!\r\nO monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,\r\nTo be direct and honest is not safe.\r\nI thank you for this profit, and from hence\r\nI’ll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nNay, stay. Thou shouldst be honest.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI should be wise; for honesty’s a fool,\r\nAnd loses that it works for.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nBy the world,\r\nI think my wife be honest, and think she is not.\r\nI think that thou art just, and think thou art not.\r\nI’ll have some proof: her name, that was as fresh\r\nAs Dian’s visage, is now begrim’d and black\r\nAs mine own face. If there be cords or knives,\r\nPoison or fire, or suffocating streams,\r\nI’ll not endure ’t. Would I were satisfied!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI see, sir, you are eaten up with passion.\r\nI do repent me that I put it to you.\r\nYou would be satisfied?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWould? Nay, I will.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nAnd may; but how? How satisfied, my lord?\r\nWould you, the supervisor, grossly gape on,\r\nBehold her topp’d?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nDeath and damnation! O!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nIt were a tedious difficulty, I think,\r\nTo bring them to that prospect. Damn them then,\r\nIf ever mortal eyes do see them bolster\r\nMore than their own! What then? How then?\r\nWhat shall I say? Where’s satisfaction?\r\nIt is impossible you should see this,\r\nWere they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,\r\nAs salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross\r\nAs ignorance made drunk. But yet I say,\r\nIf imputation and strong circumstances,\r\nWhich lead directly to the door of truth,\r\nWill give you satisfaction, you may have’t.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nGive me a living reason she’s disloyal.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI do not like the office,\r\nBut sith I am enter’d in this cause so far,\r\nPrick’d to ’t by foolish honesty and love,\r\nI will go on. I lay with Cassio lately,\r\nAnd being troubled with a raging tooth,\r\nI could not sleep.\r\nThere are a kind of men so loose of soul,\r\nThat in their sleeps will mutter their affairs.\r\nOne of this kind is Cassio:\r\nIn sleep I heard him say, “Sweet Desdemona,\r\nLet us be wary, let us hide our loves;”\r\nAnd then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,\r\nCry “O sweet creature!” and then kiss me hard,\r\nAs if he pluck’d up kisses by the roots,\r\nThat grew upon my lips, then laid his leg\r\nOver my thigh, and sigh’d and kiss’d, and then\r\nCried “Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!”\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nO monstrous! monstrous!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nNay, this was but his dream.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nBut this denoted a foregone conclusion.\r\n’Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nAnd this may help to thicken other proofs\r\nThat do demonstrate thinly.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI’ll tear her all to pieces.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nNay, but be wise. Yet we see nothing done,\r\nShe may be honest yet. Tell me but this,\r\nHave you not sometimes seen a handkerchief\r\nSpotted with strawberries in your wife’s hand?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI gave her such a one, ’twas my first gift.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI know not that: but such a handkerchief\r\n(I am sure it was your wife’s) did I today\r\nSee Cassio wipe his beard with.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nIf it be that,—\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nIf it be that, or any that was hers,\r\nIt speaks against her with the other proofs.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nO, that the slave had forty thousand lives!\r\nOne is too poor, too weak for my revenge!\r\nNow do I see ’tis true. Look here, Iago;\r\nAll my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.\r\n’Tis gone.\r\nArise, black vengeance, from thy hollow hell!\r\nYield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne\r\nTo tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,\r\nFor ’tis of aspics’ tongues!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nYet be content.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nO, blood, Iago, blood!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nPatience, I say. Your mind perhaps may change.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nNever, Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea,\r\nWhose icy current and compulsive course\r\nNe’er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on\r\nTo the Propontic and the Hellespont;\r\nEven so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace\r\nShall ne’er look back, ne’er ebb to humble love,\r\nTill that a capable and wide revenge\r\nSwallow them up. Now by yond marble heaven,\r\nIn the due reverence of a sacred vow [_Kneels._]\r\nI here engage my words.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nDo not rise yet. [_Kneels._]\r\nWitness, you ever-burning lights above,\r\nYou elements that clip us round about,\r\nWitness that here Iago doth give up\r\nThe execution of his wit, hands, heart,\r\nTo wrong’d Othello’s service! Let him command,\r\nAnd to obey shall be in me remorse,\r\nWhat bloody business ever.\r\n\r\n[_They rise._]\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI greet thy love,\r\nNot with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,\r\nAnd will upon the instant put thee to ’t.\r\nWithin these three days let me hear thee say\r\nThat Cassio’s not alive.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nMy friend is dead. ’Tis done at your request.\r\nBut let her live.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nDamn her, lewd minx! O, damn her, damn her!\r\nCome, go with me apart, I will withdraw\r\nTo furnish me with some swift means of death\r\nFor the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI am your own for ever.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV. Cyprus. Before the Castle.\r\n\r\nEnter Desdemona, Emilia and Clown.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nDo you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nI dare not say he lies anywhere.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nWhy, man?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nHe’s a soldier; and for one to say a soldier lies is stabbing.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nGo to. Where lodges he?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nTo tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nCan anything be made of this?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nI know not where he lodges; and for me to devise a lodging, and say he\r\nlies here, or he lies there, were to lie in mine own throat.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nCan you inquire him out, and be edified by report?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nI will catechize the world for him, that is, make questions and by them\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nSeek him, bid him come hither. Tell him I have moved my lord on his\r\nbehalf, and hope all will be well.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nTo do this is within the compass of man’s wit, and therefore I will\r\nattempt the doing it.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nWhere should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nI know not, madam.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nBelieve me, I had rather have lost my purse\r\nFull of crusadoes. And but my noble Moor\r\nIs true of mind and made of no such baseness\r\nAs jealous creatures are, it were enough\r\nTo put him to ill thinking.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nIs he not jealous?\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nWho, he? I think the sun where he was born\r\nDrew all such humours from him.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nLook, where he comes.\r\n\r\nEnter Othello.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nI will not leave him now till Cassio\r\nBe call’d to him. How is’t with you, my lord?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWell, my good lady. [_Aside._] O, hardness to dissemble!\r\nHow do you, Desdemona?\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nWell, my good lord.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nGive me your hand. This hand is moist, my lady.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nIt yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nThis argues fruitfulness and liberal heart.\r\nHot, hot, and moist. This hand of yours requires\r\nA sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,\r\nMuch castigation, exercise devout;\r\nFor here’s a young and sweating devil here\r\nThat commonly rebels. ’Tis a good hand,\r\nA frank one.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nYou may indeed say so,\r\nFor ’twas that hand that gave away my heart.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nA liberal hand. The hearts of old gave hands,\r\nBut our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nI cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWhat promise, chuck?\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nI have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI have a salt and sorry rheum offends me.\r\nLend me thy handkerchief.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nHere, my lord.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nThat which I gave you.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nI have it not about me.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nNot?\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nNo, faith, my lord.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nThat is a fault. That handkerchief\r\nDid an Egyptian to my mother give.\r\nShe was a charmer, and could almost read\r\nThe thoughts of people. She told her, while she kept it,\r\n’Twould make her amiable and subdue my father\r\nEntirely to her love. But if she lost it,\r\nOr made a gift of it, my father’s eye\r\nShould hold her loathed, and his spirits should hunt\r\nAfter new fancies: she, dying, gave it me,\r\nAnd bid me, when my fate would have me wive,\r\nTo give it her. I did so; and take heed on’t,\r\nMake it a darling like your precious eye.\r\nTo lose’t or give’t away were such perdition\r\nAs nothing else could match.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nIs’t possible?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\n’Tis true. There’s magic in the web of it.\r\nA sibyl, that had number’d in the world\r\nThe sun to course two hundred compasses,\r\nIn her prophetic fury sew’d the work;\r\nThe worms were hallow’d that did breed the silk,\r\nAnd it was dyed in mummy, which the skillful\r\nConserv’d of maiden’s hearts.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nIndeed? Is’t true?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nMost veritable, therefore look to ’t well.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nThen would to God that I had never seen ’t!\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nHa? wherefore?\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nWhy do you speak so startingly and rash?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nIs’t lost? is’t gone? speak, is it out of the way?\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nHeaven bless us!\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nSay you?\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nIt is not lost, but what and if it were?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nHow?\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nI say it is not lost.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nFetch’t, let me see ’t.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nWhy, so I can, sir, but I will not now.\r\nThis is a trick to put me from my suit.\r\nPray you, let Cassio be receiv’d again.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nFetch me the handkerchief! My mind misgives.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nCome, come.\r\nYou’ll never meet a more sufficient man.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nThe handkerchief!\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nI pray, talk me of Cassio.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nThe handkerchief!\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nA man that all his time\r\nHath founded his good fortunes on your love,\r\nShar’d dangers with you,—\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nThe handkerchief!\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nIn sooth, you are to blame.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nAway!\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nIs not this man jealous?\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nI ne’er saw this before.\r\nSure there’s some wonder in this handkerchief,\r\nI am most unhappy in the loss of it.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\n’Tis not a year or two shows us a man:\r\nThey are all but stomachs and we all but food;\r\nThey eat us hungerly, and when they are full,\r\nThey belch us.\r\n\r\nEnter Cassio and Iago.\r\n\r\nLook you, Cassio and my husband.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nThere is no other way; ’tis she must do ’t,\r\nAnd, lo, the happiness! Go and importune her.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nHow now, good Cassio, what’s the news with you?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nMadam, my former suit: I do beseech you\r\nThat by your virtuous means I may again\r\nExist, and be a member of his love,\r\nWhom I, with all the office of my heart,\r\nEntirely honour. I would not be delay’d.\r\nIf my offence be of such mortal kind\r\nThat nor my service past, nor present sorrows,\r\nNor purpos’d merit in futurity,\r\nCan ransom me into his love again,\r\nBut to know so must be my benefit;\r\nSo shall I clothe me in a forc’d content,\r\nAnd shut myself up in some other course\r\nTo fortune’s alms.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nAlas, thrice-gentle Cassio,\r\nMy advocation is not now in tune;\r\nMy lord is not my lord; nor should I know him\r\nWere he in favour as in humour alter’d.\r\nSo help me every spirit sanctified,\r\nAs I have spoken for you all my best,\r\nAnd stood within the blank of his displeasure\r\nFor my free speech! You must awhile be patient.\r\nWhat I can do I will; and more I will\r\nThan for myself I dare. Let that suffice you.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nIs my lord angry?\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nHe went hence but now,\r\nAnd certainly in strange unquietness.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nCan he be angry? I have seen the cannon,\r\nWhen it hath blown his ranks into the air\r\nAnd, like the devil, from his very arm\r\nPuff’d his own brother, and can he be angry?\r\nSomething of moment then. I will go meet him.\r\nThere’s matter in’t indeed if he be angry.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nI prithee do so.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Iago._]\r\n\r\nSomething sure of state,\r\nEither from Venice, or some unhatch’d practice\r\nMade demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,\r\nHath puddled his clear spirit, and in such cases\r\nMen’s natures wrangle with inferior things,\r\nThough great ones are their object. ’Tis even so.\r\nFor let our finger ache, and it indues\r\nOur other healthful members even to that sense\r\nOf pain. Nay, we must think men are not gods,\r\nNor of them look for such observancy\r\nAs fits the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,\r\nI was (unhandsome warrior as I am)\r\nArraigning his unkindness with my soul;\r\nBut now I find I had suborn’d the witness,\r\nAnd he’s indicted falsely.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nPray heaven it be state matters, as you think,\r\nAnd no conception nor no jealous toy\r\nConcerning you.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nAlas the day, I never gave him cause!\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nBut jealous souls will not be answer’d so;\r\nThey are not ever jealous for the cause,\r\nBut jealous for they are jealous: ’tis a monster\r\nBegot upon itself, born on itself.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nHeaven keep that monster from Othello’s mind!\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nLady, amen.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nI will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout:\r\nIf I do find him fit, I’ll move your suit,\r\nAnd seek to effect it to my uttermost.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nI humbly thank your ladyship.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia._]\r\n\r\nEnter Bianca.\r\n\r\nBIANCA.\r\nSave you, friend Cassio!\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nWhat make you from home?\r\nHow is it with you, my most fair Bianca?\r\nI’ faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.\r\n\r\nBIANCA.\r\nAnd I was going to your lodging, Cassio.\r\nWhat, keep a week away? Seven days and nights?\r\nEight score eight hours, and lovers’ absent hours,\r\nMore tedious than the dial eight score times?\r\nO weary reckoning!\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nPardon me, Bianca.\r\nI have this while with leaden thoughts been press’d,\r\nBut I shall in a more continuate time\r\nStrike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,\r\n\r\n[_Giving her Desdemona’s handkerchief._]\r\n\r\nTake me this work out.\r\n\r\nBIANCA.\r\nO Cassio, whence came this?\r\nThis is some token from a newer friend.\r\nTo the felt absence now I feel a cause.\r\nIs’t come to this? Well, well.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nGo to, woman!\r\nThrow your vile guesses in the devil’s teeth,\r\nFrom whence you have them. You are jealous now\r\nThat this is from some mistress, some remembrance.\r\nNo, in good troth, Bianca.\r\n\r\nBIANCA.\r\nWhy, whose is it?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nI know not neither. I found it in my chamber.\r\nI like the work well. Ere it be demanded,\r\nAs like enough it will, I’d have it copied.\r\nTake it, and do ’t, and leave me for this time.\r\n\r\nBIANCA.\r\nLeave you, wherefore?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nI do attend here on the general,\r\nAnd think it no addition, nor my wish,\r\nTo have him see me woman’d.\r\n\r\nBIANCA.\r\nWhy, I pray you?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nNot that I love you not.\r\n\r\nBIANCA.\r\nBut that you do not love me.\r\nI pray you bring me on the way a little,\r\nAnd say if I shall see you soon at night.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\n’Tis but a little way that I can bring you,\r\nFor I attend here. But I’ll see you soon.\r\n\r\nBIANCA.\r\n’Tis very good; I must be circumstanc’d.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\nACT IV\r\n\r\nSCENE I. Cyprus. Before the Castle.\r\n\nEnter Othello and Iago.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWill you think so?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nThink so, Iago?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhat,\r\nTo kiss in private?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nAn unauthoriz’d kiss.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nOr to be naked with her friend in bed\r\nAn hour or more, not meaning any harm?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nNaked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm?\r\nIt is hypocrisy against the devil:\r\nThey that mean virtuously and yet do so,\r\nThe devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nSo they do nothing, ’tis a venial slip.\r\nBut if I give my wife a handkerchief—\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWhat then?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhy then, ’tis hers, my lord, and being hers,\r\nShe may, I think, bestow’t on any man.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nShe is protectress of her honour too.\r\nMay she give that?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nHer honour is an essence that’s not seen;\r\nThey have it very oft that have it not:\r\nBut for the handkerchief—\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nBy heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.\r\nThou said’st (O, it comes o’er my memory,\r\nAs doth the raven o’er the infected house,\r\nBoding to all) he had my handkerchief.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nAy, what of that?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nThat’s not so good now.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhat\r\nIf I had said I had seen him do you wrong?\r\nOr heard him say (as knaves be such abroad,\r\nWho having, by their own importunate suit,\r\nOr voluntary dotage of some mistress,\r\nConvinced or supplied them, cannot choose\r\nBut they must blab.)\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nHath he said anything?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nHe hath, my lord, but be you well assur’d,\r\nNo more than he’ll unswear.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWhat hath he said?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nFaith, that he did—I know not what he did.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWhat? What?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nLie.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWith her?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWith her, on her, what you will.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nLie with her! lie on her!—We say lie on her when they belie her.—Lie\r\nwith her! that’s fulsome. Handkerchief—confessions—handkerchief! To\r\nconfess, and be hanged for his labour. First, to be hanged, and then to\r\nconfess. I tremble at it. Nature would not invest herself in such\r\nshadowing passion without some instruction. It is not words that shake\r\nme thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips. Is’t\r\npossible?—Confess?—handkerchief?—O devil!—\r\n\r\n[_Falls in a trance._]\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWork on,\r\nMy medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught,\r\nAnd many worthy and chaste dames even thus,\r\nAll guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! my lord!\r\nMy lord, I say! Othello!\r\n\r\nEnter Cassio.\r\n\r\nHow now, Cassio!\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nWhat’s the matter?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nMy lord is fallen into an epilepsy.\r\nThis is his second fit. He had one yesterday.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nRub him about the temples.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nNo, forbear;\r\nThe lethargy must have his quiet course.\r\nIf not, he foams at mouth, and by and by\r\nBreaks out to savage madness. Look, he stirs:\r\nDo you withdraw yourself a little while,\r\nHe will recover straight. When he is gone,\r\nI would on great occasion speak with you.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Cassio._]\r\n\r\nHow is it, general? Have you not hurt your head?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nDost thou mock me?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI mock you? No, by heaven.\r\nWould you would bear your fortune like a man!\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nA horned man’s a monster and a beast.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nThere’s many a beast, then, in a populous city,\r\nAnd many a civil monster.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nDid he confess it?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nGood sir, be a man.\r\nThink every bearded fellow that’s but yok’d\r\nMay draw with you. There’s millions now alive\r\nThat nightly lie in those unproper beds\r\nWhich they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.\r\nO, ’tis the spite of hell, the fiend’s arch-mock,\r\nTo lip a wanton in a secure couch,\r\nAnd to suppose her chaste! No, let me know,\r\nAnd knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nO, thou art wise, ’tis certain.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nStand you awhile apart,\r\nConfine yourself but in a patient list.\r\nWhilst you were here o’erwhelmed with your grief,\r\n(A passion most unsuiting such a man)\r\nCassio came hither. I shifted him away,\r\nAnd laid good ’scuse upon your ecstasy,\r\nBade him anon return, and here speak with me,\r\nThe which he promis’d. Do but encave yourself,\r\nAnd mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,\r\nThat dwell in every region of his face;\r\nFor I will make him tell the tale anew,\r\nWhere, how, how oft, how long ago, and when\r\nHe hath, and is again to cope your wife:\r\nI say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience,\r\nOr I shall say you are all in all in spleen,\r\nAnd nothing of a man.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nDost thou hear, Iago?\r\nI will be found most cunning in my patience;\r\nBut,—dost thou hear?—most bloody.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nThat’s not amiss.\r\nBut yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?\r\n\r\n[_Othello withdraws._]\r\n\r\nNow will I question Cassio of Bianca,\r\nA housewife that by selling her desires\r\nBuys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature\r\nThat dotes on Cassio, (as ’tis the strumpet’s plague\r\nTo beguile many and be beguil’d by one.)\r\nHe, when he hears of her, cannot refrain\r\nFrom the excess of laughter. Here he comes.\r\n\r\nEnter Cassio.\r\n\r\nAs he shall smile Othello shall go mad,\r\nAnd his unbookish jealousy must construe\r\nPoor Cassio’s smiles, gestures, and light behaviour\r\nQuite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nThe worser that you give me the addition\r\nWhose want even kills me.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nPly Desdemona well, and you are sure on’t.\r\n[_Speaking lower._] Now, if this suit lay in Bianca’s power,\r\nHow quickly should you speed!\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nAlas, poor caitiff!\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\n[_Aside._] Look how he laughs already!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI never knew a woman love man so.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nAlas, poor rogue! I think, i’ faith, she loves me.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\n[_Aside._] Now he denies it faintly and laughs it out.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nDo you hear, Cassio?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nNow he importunes him\r\nTo tell it o’er. Go to, well said, well said.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nShe gives it out that you shall marry her.\r\nDo you intend it?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nHa, ha, ha!\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nDo you triumph, Roman? Do you triumph?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nI marry her? What? A customer? I prithee, bear some charity to my wit,\r\ndo not think it so unwholesome. Ha, ha, ha!\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nSo, so, so, so. They laugh that wins.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nFaith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nPrithee say true.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI am a very villain else.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nHave you scored me? Well.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nThis is the monkey’s own giving out. She is persuaded I will marry her,\r\nout of her own love and flattery, not out of my promise.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nIago beckons me. Now he begins the story.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nShe was here even now. She haunts me in every place. I was the other\r\nday talking on the sea-bank with certain Venetians, and thither comes\r\nthe bauble, and falls thus about my neck.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nCrying, “O dear Cassio!” as it were: his gesture imports it.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nSo hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me; so hales and pulls me. Ha, ha,\r\nha!\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nNow he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O, I see that nose of\r\nyours, but not that dog I shall throw it to.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nWell, I must leave her company.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nBefore me! look where she comes.\r\n\r\nEnter Bianca.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\n’Tis such another fitchew! Marry, a perfum’d one.\r\nWhat do you mean by this haunting of me?\r\n\r\nBIANCA.\r\nLet the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you mean by that same\r\nhandkerchief you gave me even now? I was a fine fool to take it. I must\r\ntake out the work? A likely piece of work, that you should find it in\r\nyour chamber and not know who left it there! This is some minx’s token,\r\nand I must take out the work? There, give it your hobby-horse.\r\nWheresoever you had it, I’ll take out no work on’t.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nHow now, my sweet Bianca? How now, how now?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nBy heaven, that should be my handkerchief!\r\n\r\nBIANCA.\r\nIf you’ll come to supper tonight, you may. If you will not, come when\r\nyou are next prepared for.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nAfter her, after her.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nFaith, I must; she’ll rail in the street else.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWill you sup there?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nFaith, I intend so.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWell, I may chance to see you, for I would very fain speak with you.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nPrithee come, will you?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nGo to; say no more.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Cassio._]\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\n[_Coming forward._] How shall I murder him, Iago?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nDid you perceive how he laughed at his vice?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nO Iago!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nAnd did you see the handkerchief?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWas that mine?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nYours, by this hand: and to see how he prizes the foolish woman your\r\nwife! she gave it him, and he hath given it his whore.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI would have him nine years a-killing. A fine woman, a fair woman, a\r\nsweet woman!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nNay, you must forget that.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nAy, let her rot, and perish, and be damned tonight, for she shall not\r\nlive. No, my heart is turned to stone; I strike it, and it hurts my\r\nhand. O, the world hath not a sweeter creature. She might lie by an\r\nemperor’s side, and command him tasks.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nNay, that’s not your way.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nHang her, I do but say what she is. So delicate with her needle, an\r\nadmirable musician! O, she will sing the savageness out of a bear! Of\r\nso high and plenteous wit and invention!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nShe’s the worse for all this.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nO, a thousand, a thousand times: and then of so gentle a condition!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nAy, too gentle.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nNay, that’s certain. But yet the pity of it, Iago! O Iago, the pity of\r\nit, Iago!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nIf you are so fond over her iniquity, give her patent to offend, for if\r\nit touch not you, it comes near nobody.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI will chop her into messes. Cuckold me!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nO, ’tis foul in her.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWith mine officer!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nThat’s fouler.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nGet me some poison, Iago; this night. I’ll not expostulate with her,\r\nlest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again. This night, Iago.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nDo it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even the bed she hath\r\ncontaminated.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nGood, good. The justice of it pleases. Very good.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nAnd for Cassio, let me be his undertaker. You shall hear more by\r\nmidnight.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nExcellent good. [_A trumpet within._] What trumpet is that same?\r\n\r\nEnter Lodovico, Desdemona and Attendant.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nSomething from Venice, sure. ’Tis Lodovico\r\nCome from the duke. See, your wife is with him.\r\n\r\nLODOVICO.\r\nSave you, worthy general!\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWith all my heart, sir.\r\n\r\nLODOVICO.\r\nThe duke and senators of Venice greet you.\r\n\r\n[_Gives him a packet._]\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI kiss the instrument of their pleasures.\r\n\r\n[_Opens the packet and reads._]\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nAnd what’s the news, good cousin Lodovico?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI am very glad to see you, signior.\r\nWelcome to Cyprus.\r\n\r\nLODOVICO.\r\nI thank you.

She weeps.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nO devil, devil!\r\nIf that the earth could teem with woman’s tears,\r\nEach drop she falls would prove a crocodile.\r\nOut of my sight!\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nI will not stay to offend you.\r\n\r\n[_Going._]\r\n\r\nLODOVICO.\r\nTruly, an obedient lady.\r\nI do beseech your lordship, call her back.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nMistress!\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nMy lord?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWhat would you with her, sir?\r\n\r\nLODOVICO.\r\nWho, I, my lord?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nAy, you did wish that I would make her turn.\r\nSir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on,\r\nAnd turn again.

O thou weed,\r\nWho art so lovely fair, and smell’st so sweet,\r\nThat the sense aches at thee,\r\nWould thou hadst ne’er been born!\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nAlas, what ignorant sin have I committed?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWas this fair paper, this most goodly book,\r\nMade to write “whore” upon? What committed?\r\nCommitted! O thou public commoner!\r\nI should make very forges of my cheeks,\r\nThat would to cinders burn up modesty,\r\nDid I but speak thy deeds.

What committed!\r\nImpudent strumpet!\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nBy heaven, you do me wrong.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nAre not you a strumpet?\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nNo, as I am a Christian:\r\nIf to preserve this vessel for my lord\r\nFrom any other foul unlawful touch\r\nBe not to be a strumpet, I am none.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWhat, not a whore?\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nNo, as I shall be sav’d.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nIs’t possible?\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nO, heaven forgive us!\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI cry you mercy then.\r\nI took you for that cunning whore of Venice\r\nThat married with Othello.—You, mistress,\r\n\r\nEnter Emilia.\r\n\r\nThat have the office opposite to Saint Peter,\r\nAnd keeps the gate of hell.

How is’t with you?\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nI cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes\r\nDo it with gentle means and easy tasks.\r\nHe might have chid me so, for, in good faith,\r\nI am a child to chiding.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhat’s the matter, lady?\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nAlas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhor’d her,\r\nThrown such despite and heavy terms upon her,\r\nAs true hearts cannot bear.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nAm I that name, Iago?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhat name, fair lady?\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nSuch as she says my lord did say I was.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nHe call’d her whore: a beggar in his drink\r\nCould not have laid such terms upon his callet.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhy did he so?\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nI do not know. I am sure I am none such.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nDo not weep, do not weep: alas the day!\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nHath she forsook so many noble matches,\r\nHer father, and her country, and her friends,\r\nTo be call’d whore? would it not make one weep?\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nIt is my wretched fortune.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nBeshrew him for’t!\r\nHow comes this trick upon him?\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nNay, heaven doth know.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nI will be hang’d, if some eternal villain,\r\nSome busy and insinuating rogue,\r\nSome cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,\r\nHave not devis’d this slander. I’ll be hang’d else.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nFie, there is no such man. It is impossible.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nIf any such there be, heaven pardon him!\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nA halter pardon him, and hell gnaw his bones!\r\nWhy should he call her whore? who keeps her company?\r\nWhat place? what time? what form? what likelihood?\r\nThe Moor’s abused by some most villainous knave,\r\nSome base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.\r\nO heaven, that such companions thou’dst unfold,\r\nAnd put in every honest hand a whip\r\nTo lash the rascals naked through the world\r\nEven from the east to the west!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nSpeak within door.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nO, fie upon them! Some such squire he was\r\nThat turn’d your wit the seamy side without,\r\nAnd made you to suspect me with the Moor.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nYou are a fool. Go to.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nAlas, Iago,\r\nWhat shall I do to win my lord again?\r\nGood friend, go to him. For by this light of heaven,\r\nI know not how I lost him. Here I kneel.\r\nIf e’er my will did trespass ’gainst his love,\r\nEither in discourse of thought or actual deed,\r\nOr that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,\r\nDelighted them in any other form,\r\nOr that I do not yet, and ever did,\r\nAnd ever will, (though he do shake me off\r\nTo beggarly divorcement) love him dearly,\r\nComfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much;\r\nAnd his unkindness may defeat my life,\r\nBut never taint my love. I cannot say “whore,”\r\nIt does abhor me now I speak the word;\r\nTo do the act that might the addition earn\r\nNot the world’s mass of vanity could make me.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI pray you, be content. ’Tis but his humour.\r\nThe business of the state does him offence,\r\nAnd he does chide with you.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nIf ’twere no other,—\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\n’Tis but so, I warrant.\r\n\r\n[_Trumpets within._]\r\n\r\nHark, how these instruments summon to supper.\r\nThe messengers of Venice stay the meat.\r\nGo in, and weep not. All things shall be well.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia._]\r\n\r\nEnter Roderigo.\r\n\r\nHow now, Roderigo?\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nI do not find that thou dealest justly with me.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhat in the contrary?\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nEvery day thou daffest me with some device, Iago, and rather, as it\r\nseems to me now, keepest from me all conveniency than suppliest me with\r\nthe least advantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endure it. Nor am\r\nI yet persuaded to put up in peace what already I have foolishly\r\nsuffered.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWill you hear me, Roderigo?\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nFaith, I have heard too much, for your words and performances are no\r\nkin together.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nYou charge me most unjustly.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nWith naught but truth. I have wasted myself out of my means. The jewels\r\nyou have had from me to deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted\r\na votarist: you have told me she hath received them, and returned me\r\nexpectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance, but I\r\nfind none.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWell, go to, very well.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nVery well, go to, I cannot go to, man, nor ’tis not very well. Nay, I\r\nsay ’tis very scurvy, and begin to find myself fopped in it.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nVery well.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nI tell you ’tis not very well. I will make myself known to Desdemona.\r\nIf she will return me my jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my\r\nunlawful solicitation. If not, assure yourself I will seek satisfaction\r\nof you.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nYou have said now.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nAy, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhy, now I see there’s mettle in thee, and even from this instant do\r\nbuild on thee a better opinion than ever before. Give me thy hand,\r\nRoderigo. Thou hast taken against me a most just exception, but yet I\r\nprotest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nIt hath not appeared.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is not without\r\nwit and judgement. But, Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed,\r\nwhich I have greater reason to believe now than ever,—I mean purpose,\r\ncourage, and valour,—this night show it. If thou the next night\r\nfollowing enjoy not Desdemona, take me from this world with treachery\r\nand devise engines for my life.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nWell, what is it? Is it within reason and compass?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nSir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in\r\nOthello’s place.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nIs that true? Why then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nO, no; he goes into Mauritania, and takes away with him the fair\r\nDesdemona, unless his abode be lingered here by some accident: wherein\r\nnone can be so determinate as the removing of Cassio.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nHow do you mean “removing” of him?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nWhy, by making him uncapable of Othello’s place: knocking out his\r\nbrains.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nAnd that you would have me to do?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nAy, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He sups tonight with\r\na harlotry, and thither will I go to him. He knows not yet of his\r\nhonourable fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which I will\r\nfashion to fall out between twelve and one, you may take him at your\r\npleasure: I will be near to second your attempt, and he shall fall\r\nbetween us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with me. I will\r\nshow you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself\r\nbound to put it on him. It is now high supper-time, and the night grows\r\nto waste. About it.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nI will hear further reason for this.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nAnd you shall be satisfied.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. Cyprus.

Therefore, good Emilia,\r\nGive me my nightly wearing, and adieu.\r\nWe must not now displease him.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nI would you had never seen him!\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nSo would not I. My love doth so approve him,\r\nThat even his stubbornness, his checks, his frowns,—\r\nPrithee, unpin me,—have grace and favour in them.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nI have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nAll’s one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!\r\nIf I do die before thee, prithee, shroud me\r\nIn one of those same sheets.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nCome, come, you talk.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nMy mother had a maid call’d Barbary,\r\nShe was in love, and he she lov’d prov’d mad\r\nAnd did forsake her. She had a song of “willow”,\r\nAn old thing ’twas, but it express’d her fortune,\r\nAnd she died singing it. That song tonight\r\nWill not go from my mind. I have much to do\r\nBut to go hang my head all at one side\r\nAnd sing it like poor Barbary. Prithee dispatch.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nShall I go fetch your night-gown?\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nNo, unpin me here.\r\nThis Lodovico is a proper man.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nA very handsome man.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nHe speaks well.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nI know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to Palestine for a\r\ntouch of his nether lip.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\n[_Singing._]\r\n _The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,\r\n Sing all a green willow.\r\n Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,\r\n Sing willow, willow, willow.\r\n The fresh streams ran by her, and murmur’d her moans,\r\n Sing willow, willow, willow;\r\n Her salt tears fell from her, and soften’d the stones;—_\r\n\r\nLay by these:—\r\n\r\n[_Sings._]\r\n _Sing willow, willow, willow._\r\n\r\nPrithee hie thee.

Marry, I would\r\nnot do such a thing for a joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for\r\ngowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty exhibition; but, for the\r\nwhole world—why, who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a\r\nmonarch? I should venture purgatory for ’t.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nBeshrew me, if I would do such a wrong for the whole world.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nWhy, the wrong is but a wrong i’ the world; and having the world for\r\nyour labour, ’tis a wrong in your own world, and you might quickly make\r\nit right.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nI do not think there is any such woman.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nYes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as would store the world they\r\nplayed for.\r\nBut I do think it is their husbands’ faults\r\nIf wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,\r\nAnd pour our treasures into foreign laps;\r\nOr else break out in peevish jealousies,\r\nThrowing restraint upon us. Or say they strike us,\r\nOr scant our former having in despite.\r\nWhy, we have galls; and though we have some grace,\r\nYet have we some revenge. Let husbands know\r\nTheir wives have sense like them: they see, and smell\r\nAnd have their palates both for sweet and sour,\r\nAs husbands have. What is it that they do\r\nWhen they change us for others? Is it sport?\r\nI think it is. And doth affection breed it?\r\nI think it doth. Is’t frailty that thus errs?\r\nIt is so too. And have not we affections,\r\nDesires for sport, and frailty, as men have?\r\nThen let them use us well: else let them know,\r\nThe ills we do, their ills instruct us so.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nGood night, good night. Heaven me such usage send,\r\nNot to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\nACT V\r\n\r\nSCENE I. Cyprus.

Live Roderigo,\r\nHe calls me to a restitution large\r\nOf gold and jewels that I bobb’d from him,\r\nAs gifts to Desdemona.\r\nIt must not be. If Cassio do remain,\r\nHe hath a daily beauty in his life\r\nThat makes me ugly. And besides, the Moor\r\nMay unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril.\r\nNo, he must die. But so, I hear him coming.\r\n\r\nEnter Cassio.\r\n\r\nRODERIGO.\r\nI know his gait; ’tis he.

Yet I’ll not shed her blood,\r\nNor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,\r\nAnd smooth as monumental alabaster.\r\nYet she must die, else she’ll betray more men.\r\nPut out the light, and then put out the light:\r\nIf I quench thee, thou flaming minister,\r\nI can again thy former light restore,\r\nShould I repent me. But once put out thy light,\r\nThou cunning’st pattern of excelling nature,\r\nI know not where is that Promethean heat\r\nThat can thy light relume. When I have pluck’d thy rose,\r\nI cannot give it vital growth again,\r\nIt must needs wither. I’ll smell it on the tree.\r\n\r\n[_Kissing her._]\r\n\r\nO, balmy breath, that dost almost persuade\r\nJustice to break her sword!

What’s the matter?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nThat handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee,\r\nThou gav’st to Cassio.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nNo, by my life and soul!\r\nSend for the man and ask him.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nSweet soul, take heed, take heed of perjury,\r\nThou’rt on thy death-bed.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nAy, but not yet to die.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nYes, presently:\r\nTherefore confess thee freely of thy sin.\r\nFor to deny each article with oath\r\nCannot remove nor choke the strong conception\r\nThat I do groan withal. Thou art to die.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nThen, Lord have mercy on me!\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI say, amen.\r\n\r\nDESDEMONA.\r\nAnd have you mercy too!

I am glad thy father’s dead.\r\nThy match was mortal to him, and pure grief\r\nShore his old thread in twain: did he live now,\r\nThis sight would make him do a desperate turn,\r\nYea, curse his better angel from his side,\r\nAnd fall to reprobance.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\n’Tis pitiful. But yet Iago knows\r\nThat she with Cassio hath the act of shame\r\nA thousand times committed; Cassio confess’d it,\r\nAnd she did gratify his amorous works\r\nWith that recognizance and pledge of love\r\nWhich I first gave her; I saw it in his hand.\r\nIt was a handkerchief, an antique token\r\nMy father gave my mother.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nO heaven! O heavenly powers!\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nCome, hold your peace.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\n’Twill out, ’twill out.

What should such a fool\r\nDo with so good a wife?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO\r\nAre there not stones in heaven\r\nBut what serve for thunder? Precious villain!\r\n\r\n[_Iago stabs Emilia and then runs out._]\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nThe woman falls. Sure, he hath kill’d his wife.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nAy, ay. O, lay me by my mistress’ side.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nHe’s gone, but his wife’s kill’d.\r\n\r\nMONTANO.\r\n’Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon,\r\nWhich I have here recover’d from the Moor.\r\nCome, guard the door without, let him not pass,\r\nBut kill him rather. I’ll after that same villain,\r\nFor ’tis a damned slave.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Montano and Gratiano._]\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI am not valiant neither,\r\nBut every puny whipster gets my sword.\r\nBut why should honour outlive honesty?\r\nLet it go all.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nWhat did thy song bode, lady?\r\nHark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan,\r\nAnd die in music.\r\n[_Sings._] _Willow, willow, willow._\r\nMoor, she was chaste. She lov’d thee, cruel Moor,\r\nSo come my soul to bliss, as I speak true;\r\nSo speaking as I think, I die, I die.\r\n\r\n[_She dies._]\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI have another weapon in this chamber,\r\nIt is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook’s temper.\r\nO, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\n[_Within._] If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear;\r\nThou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nLook in upon me then, and speak with me,\r\nOr, naked as I am, I will assault thee.\r\n\r\nEnter Gratiano.\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nWhat is the matter?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nBehold, I have a weapon.\r\nA better never did itself sustain\r\nUpon a soldier’s thigh: I have seen the day\r\nThat with this little arm and this good sword\r\nI have made my way through more impediments\r\nThan twenty times your stop. But, O vain boast!\r\nWho can control his fate? ’Tis not so now.\r\nBe not afraid, though you do see me weapon’d.\r\nHere is my journey’s end, here is my butt,\r\nAnd very sea-mark of my utmost sail.\r\nDo you go back dismay’d? ’Tis a lost fear.\r\nMan but a rush against Othello’s breast,\r\nAnd he retires. Where should Othello go?\r\nNow, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr’d wench,\r\nPale as thy smock, when we shall meet at compt,\r\nThis look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,\r\nAnd fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!\r\nEven like thy chastity.\r\nO cursed, cursed slave! Whip me, ye devils,\r\nFrom the possession of this heavenly sight!\r\nBlow me about in winds, roast me in sulphur,\r\nWash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!\r\nO Desdemon! Dead, Desdemon! dead! Oh, oh!\r\n\r\nEnter Lodovico, Montano, Cassio carried in a chair, and Officers with\r\nIago prisoner.\r\n\r\nLODOVICO.\r\nWhere is this rash and most unfortunate man?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nThat’s he that was Othello. Here I am.\r\n\r\nLODOVICO.\r\nWhere is that viper? Bring the villain forth.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI look down towards his feet; but that’s a fable.\r\nIf that thou be’st a devil, I cannot kill thee.\r\n\r\n[_Wounds Iago._]\r\n\r\nLODOVICO.\r\nWrench his sword from him.\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nI bleed, sir, but not kill’d.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI am not sorry neither. I’d have thee live,\r\nFor in my sense ’tis happiness to die.\r\n\r\nLODOVICO.\r\nO thou Othello, that wert once so good,\r\nFall’n in the practice of a damned slave,\r\nWhat shall be said to thee?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWhy, anything;\r\nAn honourable murderer, if you will.\r\nFor naught did I in hate, but all in honour.\r\n\r\nLODOVICO.\r\nThis wretch hath part confess’d his villany.\r\nDid you and he consent in Cassio’s death?\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nAy.\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nDear general, I never gave you cause.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI do believe it, and I ask your pardon.\r\nWill you, I pray, demand that demi-devil\r\nWhy he hath thus ensnar’d my soul and body?\r\n\r\nIAGO.\r\nDemand me nothing. What you know, you know.\r\nFrom this time forth I never will speak word.\r\n\r\nLODOVICO.\r\nWhat, not to pray?\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nTorments will ope your lips.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nWell, thou dost best.\r\n\r\nLODOVICO.\r\nSir, you shall understand what hath befall’n,\r\nWhich, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter\r\nFound in the pocket of the slain Roderigo,\r\nAnd here another. The one of them imports\r\nThe death of Cassio, to be undertook\r\nBy Roderigo.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nO villain!\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nMost heathenish and most gross!\r\n\r\nLODOVICO.\r\nNow here’s another discontented paper,\r\nFound in his pocket too; and this, it seems,\r\nRoderigo meant to have sent this damned villain,\r\nBut that, belike, Iago in the interim\r\nCame in and satisfied him.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nO the pernicious caitiff!\r\nHow came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief\r\nThat was my wife’s?\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nI found it in my chamber.\r\nAnd he himself confess’d but even now,\r\nThat there he dropp’d it for a special purpose\r\nWhich wrought to his desire.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nO fool! fool! fool!\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nThere is besides in Roderigo’s letter,\r\nHow he upbraids Iago, that he made him\r\nBrave me upon the watch, whereon it came\r\nThat I was cast. And even but now he spake,\r\nAfter long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,\r\nIago set him on.\r\n\r\nLODOVICO.\r\nYou must forsake this room, and go with us.\r\nYour power and your command is taken off,\r\nAnd Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,\r\nIf there be any cunning cruelty\r\nThat can torment him much and hold him long,\r\nIt shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,\r\nTill that the nature of your fault be known\r\nTo the Venetian state. Come, bring away.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nSoft you; a word or two before you go.\r\nI have done the state some service, and they know’t.\r\nNo more of that. I pray you, in your letters,\r\nWhen you shall these unlucky deeds relate,\r\nSpeak of me as I am. Nothing extenuate,\r\nNor set down aught in malice. Then must you speak\r\nOf one that loved not wisely, but too well;\r\nOf one not easily jealous, but being wrought,\r\nPerplex’d in the extreme; of one whose hand,\r\nLike the base Judean, threw a pearl away\r\nRicher than all his tribe; of one whose subdu’d eyes,\r\nAlbeit unused to the melting mood,\r\nDrop tears as fast as the Arabian trees\r\nTheir medicinal gum. Set you down this.\r\nAnd say besides, that in Aleppo once,\r\nWhere a malignant and a turban’d Turk\r\nBeat a Venetian and traduc’d the state,\r\nI took by the throat the circumcised dog,\r\nAnd smote him, thus.\r\n\r\n[_Stabs himself._]\r\n\r\nLODOVICO.\r\nO bloody period!\r\n\r\nGRATIANO.\r\nAll that’s spoke is marr’d.\r\n\r\nOTHELLO.\r\nI kiss’d thee ere I kill’d thee. No way but this,\r\nKilling myself, to die upon a kiss.\r\n\r\n[_Falling upon Desdemona._]\r\n\r\nCASSIO.\r\nThis did I fear, but thought he had no weapon,\r\nFor he was great of heart.\r\n\r\nLODOVICO.\r\n[_To Iago._] O Spartan dog,\r\nMore fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea,\r\nLook on the tragic loading of this bed.\r\nThis is thy work. The object poisons sight,\r\nLet it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house,\r\nAnd seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,\r\nFor they succeed on you. To you, lord governor,\r\nRemains the censure of this hellish villain.\r\nThe time, the place, the torture, O, enforce it!\r\nMyself will straight aboard, and to the state\r\nThis heavy act with heavy heart relate.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\nPERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE\r\n\nContents\r\n\nACT I\r\nChorus.

Enter the Daughter of Antiochus.\r\n\r\nPERICLES.\r\nSee where she comes, apparell’d like the spring,\r\nGraces her subjects, and her thoughts the king\r\nOf every virtue gives renown to men!\r\nHer face the book of praises, where is read\r\nNothing but curious pleasures, as from thence\r\nSorrow were ever razed, and testy wrath\r\nCould never be her mild companion.\r\nYou gods that made me man, and sway in love,\r\nThat have inflamed desire in my breast\r\nTo taste the fruit of yon celestial tree,\r\nOr die in the adventure, be my helps,\r\nAs I am son and servant to your will,\r\nTo compass such a boundless happiness!\r\n\r\nANTIOCHUS.\r\nPrince Pericles,—\r\n\r\nPERICLES.\r\nThat would be son to great Antiochus.\r\n\r\nANTIOCHUS.\r\nBefore thee stands this fair Hesperides,\r\nWith golden fruit, but dangerous to be touch’d;\r\nFor death-like dragons here affright thee hard:\r\nHer face, like heaven, enticeth thee to view\r\nHer countless glory, which desert must gain;\r\nAnd which, without desert, because thine eye\r\nPresumes to reach, all the whole heap must die.\r\nYon sometimes famous princes, like thyself,\r\nDrawn by report, adventurous by desire,\r\nTell thee, with speechless tongues and semblance pale,\r\nThat without covering, save yon field of stars,\r\nHere they stand Martyrs, slain in Cupid’s wars;\r\nAnd with dead cheeks advise thee to desist\r\nFor going on death’s net, whom none resist.\r\n\r\nPERICLES.\r\nAntiochus, I thank thee, who hath taught\r\nMy frail mortality to know itself,\r\nAnd by those fearful objects to prepare\r\nThis body, like to them, to what I must;\r\nFor death remember’d should be like a mirror,\r\nWho tells us life’s but breath, to trust it error.\r\nI’ll make my will then, and, as sick men do\r\nWho know the world, see heaven, but, feeling woe,\r\nGripe not at earthly joys as erst they did;\r\nSo I bequeath a happy peace to you\r\nAnd all good men, as every prince should do;\r\nMy riches to the earth from whence they came;\r\n[_To the daughter of Antiochus._] But my unspotted fire of love to you.\r\nThus ready for the way of life or death,\r\nI wait the sharpest blow, Antiochus.\r\n\r\nANTIOCHUS.\r\nScorning advice, read the conclusion, then:\r\nWhich read and not expounded, ’tis decreed,\r\nAs these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nOf all ’ssayed yet, mayst thou prove prosperous!\r\nOf all ’ssayed yet, I wish thee happiness!\r\n\r\nPERICLES\r\nLike a bold champion, I assume the lists,\r\nNor ask advice of any other thought\r\nBut faithfulness and courage.\r\n\r\n [_He reads the riddle._]\r\n\r\n _I am no viper, yet I feed\r\n On mother’s flesh which did me breed.\r\n I sought a husband, in which labour\r\n I found that kindness in a father:\r\n He’s father, son, and husband mild;\r\n I mother, wife, and yet his child.\r\n How they may be, and yet in two,\r\n As you will live resolve it you._\r\n\r\nSharp physic is the last: but, O you powers\r\nThat give heaven countless eyes to view men’s acts,\r\nWhy cloud they not their sights perpetually,\r\nIf this be true, which makes me pale to read it?\r\nFair glass of light, I loved you, and could still,\r\n\r\n [_Takes hold of the hand of the Princess._]\r\n\r\nWere not this glorious casket stored with ill:\r\nBut I must tell you, now my thoughts revolt;\r\nFor he’s no man on whom perfections wait\r\nThat, knowing sin within, will touch the gate,\r\nYou are a fair viol, and your sense the strings;\r\nWho, finger’d to make man his lawful music,\r\nWould draw heaven down, and all the gods to hearken;\r\nBut being play’d upon before your time,\r\nHell only danceth at so harsh a chime.\r\nGood sooth, I care not for you.\r\n\r\nANTIOCHUS.\r\nPrince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life,\r\nFor that’s an article within our law,\r\nAs dangerous as the rest.

The blind mole casts\r\nCopp’d hills towards heaven, to tell the earth is throng’d\r\nBy man’s oppression; and the poor worm doth die for’t.\r\nKind are earth’s gods; in vice their law’s their will;\r\nAnd if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill?\r\nIt is enough you know; and it is fit,\r\nWhat being more known grows worse, to smother it.\r\nAll love the womb that their first bred,\r\nThen give my tongue like leave to love my head.\r\n\r\nANTIOCHUS.\r\n[_Aside_] Heaven, that I had thy head!

Here must I kill King Pericles;\r\nand if I do it not, I am sure to be hanged at home: ’tis dangerous.\r\nWell, I perceive he was a wise fellow, and had good discretion, that,\r\nbeing bid to ask what he would of the king, desired he might know none\r\nof his secrets: now do I see he had some reason for’t; for if a king\r\nbid a man be a villain, he’s bound by the indenture of his oath to be\r\none.

I hope, sir, if you thrive, you’ll remember from whence you had\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nPERICLES.\r\nBelieve’t I will.\r\nBy your furtherance I am clothed in steel;\r\nAnd spite of all the rapture of the sea,\r\nThis jewel holds his building on my arm:\r\nUnto thy value I will mount myself\r\nUpon a courser, whose delightful steps\r\nShall make the gazer joy to see him tread.\r\nOnly, my friend, I yet am unprovided\r\nOf a pair of bases.\r\n\r\nSECOND FISHERMAN.\r\nWe’ll sure provide: thou shalt have my best gown to make thee a pair;\r\nand I’ll bring thee to the court myself.\r\n\r\nPERICLES.\r\nThen honour be but a goal to my will,\r\nThis day I’ll rise, or else add ill to ill.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\nSCENE II.

We here below\r\nRecall not what we give, and therein may\r\nVie honour with you.\r\n\r\nLYCHORIDA.\r\nPatience, good sir.\r\nEven for this charge.\r\n\r\nPERICLES.\r\nNow, mild may be thy life!\r\nFor a more blustrous birth had never babe:\r\nQuiet and gentle thy conditions! for\r\nThou art the rudeliest welcome to this world\r\nThat ever was prince’s child. Happy what follows!\r\nThou hast as chiding a nativity\r\nAs fire, air, water, earth, and heaven can make,\r\nTo herald thee from the womb.\r\nEven at the first thy loss is more than can\r\nThy portage quit, with all thou canst find here,\r\nNow, the good gods throw their best eyes upon’t!\r\n\r\n Enter two Sailors\r\n\r\nFIRST SAILOR.\r\nWhat courage, sir? God save you!\r\n\r\nPERICLES.\r\nCourage enough: I do not fear the flaw;\r\nIt hath done to me the worst. Yet, for the love\r\nOf this poor infant, this fresh new sea-farer,\r\nI would it would be quiet.\r\n\r\nFIRST SAILOR.\r\nSlack the bolins there! Thou wilt not, wilt thou? Blow, and split\r\nthyself.\r\n\r\nSECOND SAILOR.\r\nBut sea-room, and the brine and cloudy billow kiss the moon, I care\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nFIRST SAILOR.\r\nSir, your queen must overboard: the sea works high, the wind is loud\r\nand will not lie till the ship be cleared of the dead.\r\n\r\nPERICLES.\r\nThat’s your superstition.\r\n\r\nFIRST SAILOR.\r\nPardon us, sir; with us at sea it has been still observed; and we are\r\nstrong in custom. Therefore briefly yield her; for she must overboard\r\nstraight.\r\n\r\nPERICLES.\r\nAs you think meet. Most wretched queen!\r\n\r\nLYCHORIDA.\r\nHere she lies, sir.\r\n\r\nPERICLES.\r\nA terrible childbed hast thou had, my dear;\r\nNo light, no fire: th’unfriendly elements\r\nForgot thee utterly; nor have I time\r\nTo give thee hallow’d to thy grave, but straight\r\nMust cast thee, scarcely coffin’d, in the ooze;\r\nWhere, for a monument upon thy bones,\r\nAnd e’er-remaining lamps, the belching whale\r\nAnd humming water must o’erwhelm thy corpse,\r\nLying with simple shells. O Lychorida.\r\nBid Nestor bring me spices, ink and paper,\r\nMy casket and my jewels; and bid Nicander\r\nBring me the satin coffer: lay the babe\r\nUpon the pillow: hie thee, whiles I say\r\nA priestly farewell to her: suddenly, woman.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Lychorida._]\r\n\r\nSECOND SAILOR.\r\nSir, we have a chest beneath the hatches, caulked and bitumed ready.\r\n\r\nPERICLES.\r\nI thank thee. Mariner, say what coast is this?\r\n\r\nSECOND SAILOR.\r\nWe are near Tarsus.\r\n\r\nPERICLES.\r\nThither, gentle mariner,\r\nAlter thy course for Tyre. When canst thou reach it?\r\n\r\nSECOND SAILOR.\r\nBy break of day, if the wind cease.\r\n\r\nPERICLES.\r\nO, make for Tarsus!\r\nThere will I visit Cleon, for the babe\r\nCannot hold out to Tyrus. There I’ll leave it\r\nAt careful nursing. Go thy ways, good mariner:\r\nI’ll bring the body presently.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\nSCENE II. Ephesus.

Wrench it open straight:\r\nIf the sea’s stomach be o’ercharged with gold,\r\n’Tis a good constraint of fortune it belches upon us.\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\r\n’Tis so, my lord.\r\n\r\nCERIMON.\r\nHow close ’tis caulk’d and bitumed!\r\nDid the sea cast it up?\r\n\r\nFIRST SERVANT.\r\nI never saw so huge a billow, sir,\r\nAs toss’d it upon shore.\r\n\r\nCERIMON.\r\nWrench it open;\r\nSoft! it smells most sweetly in my sense.\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\r\nA delicate odour.\r\n\r\nCERIMON.\r\nAs ever hit my nostril.

Come, come;\r\nAnd Aesculapius guide us!\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt, carrying her away._]\r\n\nSCENE III. Tarsus. A room in Cleon’s house.\r\n\r\n Enter Pericles, Cleon, Dionyza and Lychorida with Marina in her arms.\r\n\r\nPERICLES.\r\nMost honour’d Cleon, I must needs be gone;\r\nMy twelve months are expired, and Tyrus stands\r\nIn a litigious peace. You and your lady,\r\nTake from my heart all thankfulness! The gods\r\nMake up the rest upon you!\r\n\r\nCLEON.\r\nYour shafts of fortune, though they hurt you mortally,\r\nYet glance full wanderingly on us.\r\n\r\nDIONYZA.\r\nO, your sweet queen!\r\nThat the strict fates had pleased you had brought her hither,\r\nTo have bless’d mine eyes with her!\r\n\r\nPERICLES.\r\nWe cannot but obey\r\nThe powers above us. Could I rage and roar\r\nAs doth the sea she lies in, yet the end\r\nMust be as ’tis. My gentle babe Marina,\r\nWhom, for she was born at sea, I have named so,\r\nHere I charge your charity withal,\r\nLeaving her the infant of your care;\r\nBeseeching you to give her princely training,\r\nThat she may be manner’d as she is born.\r\n\r\nCLEON.\r\nFear not, my lord, but think\r\nYour grace, that fed my country with your corn,\r\nFor which the people’s prayers still fall upon you,\r\nMust in your child be thought on. If neglection\r\nShould therein make me vile, the common body,\r\nBy you relieved, would force me to my duty:\r\nBut if to that my nature need a spur,\r\nThe gods revenge it upon me and mine,\r\nTo the end of generation!\r\n\r\nPERICLES.\r\nI believe you;\r\nYour honour and your goodness teach me to’t,\r\nWithout your vows. Till she be married, madam,\r\nBy bright Diana, whom we honour, all\r\nUnscissored shall this hair of mine remain,\r\nThough I show ill in’t. So I take my leave.\r\nGood madam, make me blessed in your care\r\nIn bringing up my child.\r\n\r\nDIONYZA.\r\nI have one myself,\r\nWho shall not be more dear to my respect\r\nThan yours, my lord.\r\n\r\nPERICLES.\r\nMadam, my thanks and prayers.\r\n\r\nCLEON.\r\nWe’ll bring your grace e’en to the edge o’the shore,\r\nThen give you up to the mask’d Neptune and\r\nThe gentlest winds of heaven.\r\n\r\nPERICLES.\r\nI will embrace your offer.

But since King Pericles,\r\nMy wedded lord, I ne’er shall see again,\r\nA vestal livery will I take me to,\r\nAnd never more have joy.\r\n\r\nCERIMON.\r\nMadam, if this you purpose as ye speak,\r\nDiana’s temple is not distant far,\r\nWhere you may abide till your date expire.\r\nMoreover, if you please, a niece of mine\r\nShall there attend you.\r\n\r\nTHAISA.\r\nMy recompense is thanks, that’s all;\r\nYet my good will is great, though the gift small.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\nACT IV\r\n\n Enter Gower.\r\n\r\nGOWER.\r\nImagine Pericles arrived at Tyre,\r\nWelcomed and settled to his own desire.\r\nHis woeful queen we leave at Ephesus,\r\nUnto Diana there a votaress.\r\nNow to Marina bend your mind,\r\nWhom our fast-growing scene must find\r\nAt Tarsus, and by Cleon train’d\r\nIn music’s letters; who hath gain’d\r\nOf education all the grace,\r\nWhich makes her both the heart and place\r\nOf general wonder. But, alack,\r\nThat monster envy, oft the wrack\r\nOf earned praise, Marina’s life\r\nSeeks to take off by treason’s knife,\r\nAnd in this kind our Cleon hath\r\nOne daughter, and a full grown wench\r\nEven ripe for marriage-rite; this maid\r\nHight Philoten: and it is said\r\nFor certain in our story, she\r\nWould ever with Marina be.\r\nBe’t when she weaved the sleided silk\r\nWith fingers long, small, white as milk;\r\nOr when she would with sharp needle wound,\r\nThe cambric, which she made more sound\r\nBy hurting it; or when to th’ lute\r\nShe sung, and made the night-bird mute\r\nThat still records with moan; or when\r\nShe would with rich and constant pen\r\nVail to her mistress Dian; still\r\nThis Philoten contends in skill\r\nWith absolute Marina: so\r\nThe dove of Paphos might with the crow\r\nVie feathers white. Marina gets\r\nAll praises, which are paid as debts,\r\nAnd not as given. This so darks\r\nIn Philoten all graceful marks,\r\nThat Cleon’s wife, with envy rare,\r\nA present murderer does prepare\r\nFor good Marina, that her daughter\r\nMight stand peerless by this slaughter.\r\nThe sooner her vile thoughts to stead,\r\nLychorida, our nurse, is dead:\r\nAnd cursed Dionyza hath\r\nThe pregnant instrument of wrath\r\nPrest for this blow. The unborn event\r\nI do commend to your content:\r\nOnly I carry winged time\r\nPost on the lame feet of my rhyme;\r\nWhich never could I so convey,\r\nUnless your thoughts went on my way.\r\nDionyza does appear,\r\nWith Leonine, a murderer.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\nScene I. Tarsus. An open place near the seashore.\r\n\r\n Enter Dionyza with Leonine.\r\n\r\nDIONYZA.\r\nThy oath remember; thou hast sworn to do’t:\r\n’Tis but a blow, which never shall be known.\r\nThou canst not do a thing in the world so soon,\r\nTo yield thee so much profit. Let not conscience,\r\nWhich is but cold, inflaming love i’ thy bosom,\r\nInflame too nicely; nor let pity, which\r\nEven women have cast off, melt thee, but be\r\nA soldier to thy purpose.\r\n\r\nLEONINE.\r\nI will do’t; but yet she is a goodly creature.\r\n\r\nDIONYZA.\r\nThe fitter, then, the gods should have her. Here she comes weeping for\r\nher only mistress’ death. Thou art resolved?\r\n\r\nLEONINE.\r\nI am resolved.\r\n\r\n Enter Marina with a basket of flowers.\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nNo, I will rob Tellus of her weed\r\nTo strew thy green with flowers: the yellows, blues,\r\nThe purple violets, and marigolds,\r\nShall as a carpet hang upon thy grave,\r\nWhile summer days do last. Ay me! poor maid,\r\nBorn in a tempest, when my mother died,\r\nThis world to me is like a lasting storm,\r\nWhirring me from my friends.\r\n\r\nDIONYZA.\r\nHow now, Marina! why do you keep alone?\r\nHow chance my daughter is not with you?\r\nDo not consume your blood with sorrowing;\r\nHave you a nurse of me? Lord, how your favour’s\r\nChanged with this unprofitable woe!\r\nCome, give me your flowers, ere the sea mar it.\r\nWalk with Leonine; the air is quick there,\r\nAnd it pierces and sharpens the stomach.\r\nCome, Leonine, take her by the arm, walk with her.\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nNo, I pray you;\r\nI’ll not bereave you of your servant.\r\n\r\nDIONYZA.\r\nCome, come;\r\nI love the king your father, and yourself,\r\nWith more than foreign heart. We every day\r\nExpect him here: when he shall come and find\r\nOur paragon to all reports thus blasted,\r\nHe will repent the breadth of his great voyage;\r\nBlame both my lord and me, that we have taken\r\nNo care to your best courses. Go, I pray you,\r\nWalk, and be cheerful once again; reserve\r\nThat excellent complexion, which did steal\r\nThe eyes of young and old. Care not for me;\r\nI can go home alone.\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nWell, I will go;\r\nBut yet I have no desire to it.\r\n\r\nDIONYZA.\r\nCome, come, I know ’tis good for you.\r\nWalk half an hour, Leonine, at the least:\r\nRemember what I have said.\r\n\r\nLEONINE.\r\nI warrant you, madam.\r\n\r\nDIONYZA.\r\nI’ll leave you, my sweet lady, for a while:\r\nPray, walk softly, do not heat your blood:\r\nWhat! I must have a care of you.\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nMy thanks, sweet madam.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Dionyza._]\r\n\r\nIs this wind westerly that blows?\r\n\r\nLEONINE.\r\nSouth-west.\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nWhen I was born the wind was north.\r\n\r\nLEONINE.\r\nWas’t so?\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nMy father, as nurse said, did never fear,\r\nBut cried ‘Good seamen!’ to the sailors,\r\nGalling his kingly hands, haling ropes;\r\nAnd clasping to the mast, endured a sea\r\nThat almost burst the deck.\r\n\r\nLEONINE.\r\nWhen was this?\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nWhen I was born:\r\nNever was waves nor wind more violent;\r\nAnd from the ladder tackle washes off\r\nA canvas-climber. ‘Ha!’ says one, ‘wolt out?’\r\nAnd with a dropping industry they skip\r\nFrom stem to stern: the boatswain whistles, and\r\nThe master calls and trebles their confusion.\r\n\r\nLEONINE.\r\nCome, say your prayers.\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nWhat mean you?\r\n\r\nLEONINE.\r\nIf you require a little space for prayer,\r\nI grant it: pray; but be not tedious,\r\nFor the gods are quick of ear, and I am sworn\r\nTo do my work with haste.\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nWhy will you kill me?\r\n\r\nLEONINE.\r\nTo satisfy my lady.\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nWhy would she have me kill’d now?\r\nAs I can remember, by my troth,\r\nI never did her hurt in all my life:\r\nI never spake bad word, nor did ill turn\r\nTo any living creature: believe me, la,\r\nI never kill’d a mouse, nor hurt a fly:\r\nI trod upon a worm against my will,\r\nBut I wept for it. How have I offended,\r\nWherein my death might yield her any profit,\r\nOr my life imply her any danger?\r\n\r\nLEONINE.\r\nMy commission\r\nIs not to reason of the deed, but do it.\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nYou will not do’t for all the world, I hope.\r\nYou are well favour’d, and your looks foreshow\r\nYou have a gentle heart. I saw you lately,\r\nWhen you caught hurt in parting two that fought:\r\nGood sooth, it show’d well in you: do so now:\r\nYour lady seeks my life; come you between,\r\nAnd save poor me, the weaker.\r\n\r\nLEONINE.\r\nI am sworn,\r\nAnd will dispatch.\r\n\r\n [_He seizes her._]\r\n\r\n Enter Pirates.\r\n\r\nFIRST PIRATE.\r\nHold, villain!\r\n\r\n [_Leonine runs away._]\r\n\r\nSECOND PIRATE.\r\nA prize! a prize!\r\n\r\nTHIRD PIRATE.\r\nHalf part, mates, half part,\r\nCome, let’s have her aboard suddenly.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Pirates with Marina._]\r\n\r\n Re-enter Leonine.\r\n\r\nLEONINE.\r\nThese roguing thieves serve the great pirate Valdes;\r\nAnd they have seized Marina. Let her go:\r\nThere’s no hope she will return. I’ll swear she’s dead\r\nAnd thrown into the sea. But I’ll see further:\r\nPerhaps they will but please themselves upon her,\r\nNot carry her aboard.

We lost too\r\nmuch money this mart by being too wenchless.\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nWe were never so much out of creatures. We have but poor three, and\r\nthey can do no more than they can do; and they with continual action\r\nare even as good as rotten.\r\n\r\nPANDAR.\r\nTherefore let’s have fresh ones, whate’er we pay for them. If there be\r\nnot a conscience to be used in every trade, we shall never prosper.\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nThou sayest true: ’tis not our bringing up of poor bastards,—as, I\r\nthink, I have brought up some eleven—\r\n\r\nBOULT.\r\nAy, to eleven; and brought them down again. But shall I search the\r\nmarket?\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nWhat else, man? The stuff we have, a strong wind will blow it to\r\npieces, they are so pitifully sodden.\r\n\r\nPANDAR.\r\nThou sayest true; they’re too unwholesome, o’ conscience. The poor\r\nTransylvanian is dead, that lay with the little baggage.\r\n\r\nBOULT.\r\nAy, she quickly pooped him; she made him roast-meat for worms. But I’ll\r\ngo search the market.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nPANDAR.\r\nThree or four thousand chequins were as pretty a proportion to live\r\nquietly, and so give over.\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nWhy to give over, I pray you? Is it a shame to get when we are old?\r\n\r\nPANDAR.\r\nO, our credit comes not in like the commodity, nor the commodity wages\r\nnot with the danger: therefore, if in our youths we could pick up some\r\npretty estate, ’twere not amiss to keep our door hatched. Besides, the\r\nsore terms we stand upon with the gods will be strong with us for\r\ngiving over.\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nCome, others sorts offend as well as we.\r\n\r\nPANDAR.\r\nAs well as we! ay, and better too; we offend worse. Neither is our\r\nprofession any trade; it’s no calling. But here comes Boult.\r\n\r\n Re-enter Boult, with the Pirates and Marina.\r\n\r\nBOULT\r\n[_To Pirates._] Come your ways. My masters, you say she’s a virgin?\r\n\r\nFIRST PIRATE.\r\nO sir, we doubt it not.\r\n\r\nBOULT.\r\nMaster, I have gone through for this piece, you see: if you like her,\r\nso; if not, I have lost my earnest.\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nBoult, has she any qualities?\r\n\r\nBOULT.\r\nShe has a good face, speaks well and has excellent good clothes:\r\nthere’s no farther necessity of qualities can make her be refused.\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nWhat is her price, Boult?\r\n\r\nBOULT.\r\nI cannot be baited one doit of a thousand pieces.\r\n\r\nPANDAR.\r\nWell, follow me, my masters, you shall have your money presently. Wife,\r\ntake her in; instruct her what she has to do, that she may not be raw\r\nin her entertainment.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Pandar and Pirates._]\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nBoult, take you the marks of her, the colour of her hair, complexion,\r\nheight, her age, with warrant of her virginity; and cry ‘He that will\r\ngive most shall have her first.’ Such a maidenhead were no cheap thing,\r\nif men were as they have been. Get this done as I command you.\r\n\r\nBOULT.\r\nPerformance shall follow.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nAlack that Leonine was so slack, so slow!\r\nHe should have struck, not spoke; or that these pirates,\r\nNot enough barbarous, had not o’erboard thrown me\r\nFor to seek my mother!\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nWhy lament you, pretty one?\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nThat I am pretty.\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nCome, the gods have done their part in you.\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nI accuse them not.\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nYou are light into my hands, where you are like to live.\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nThe more my fault\r\nTo scape his hands where I was like to die.\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nAy, and you shall live in pleasure.\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nYes, indeed shall you, and taste gentlemen of all fashions: you shall\r\nfare well; you shall have the difference of all complexions. What! do\r\nyou stop your ears?\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nAre you a woman?\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nWhat would you have me be, an I be not a woman?\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nAn honest woman, or not a woman.\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nMarry, whip the gosling: I think I shall have something to do with you.\r\nCome, you’re a young foolish sapling, and must be bowed as I would have\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nThe gods defend me!\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nIf it please the gods to defend you by men, then men must comfort you,\r\nmen must feed you, men stir you up. Boult’s returned.\r\n\r\n Re-enter Boult.\r\n\r\nNow, sir, hast thou cried her through the market?\r\n\r\nBOULT.\r\nI have cried her almost to the number of her hairs; I have drawn her\r\npicture with my voice.\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nAnd I prithee tell me, how dost thou find the inclination of the\r\npeople, especially of the younger sort?\r\n\r\nBOULT.\r\nFaith, they listened to me as they would have hearkened to their\r\nfather’s testament. There was a Spaniard’s mouth so watered, that he\r\nwent to bed to her very description.\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nWe shall have him here tomorrow with his best ruff on.\r\n\r\nBOULT.\r\nTonight, tonight. But, mistress, do you know the French knight that\r\ncowers i’ the hams?\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nWho, Monsieur Veroles?\r\n\r\nBOULT.\r\nAy, he: he offered to cut a caper at the proclamation; but he made a\r\ngroan at it, and swore he would see her tomorrow.\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nWell, well, as for him, he brought his disease hither: here he does but\r\nrepair it. I know he will come in our shadow, to scatter his crowns in\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nBOULT.\r\nWell, if we had of every nation a traveller, we should lodge them with\r\nthis sign.\r\n\r\n [_To Marina._] Pray you, come hither awhile. You have fortunes coming\r\n upon you. Mark me: you must seem to do that fearfully which you commit\r\n willingly, despise profit where you have most gain. To weep that you\r\n live as ye do makes pity in your lovers: seldom but that pity begets\r\n you a good opinion, and that opinion a mere profit.\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nI understand you not.\r\n\r\nBOULT.\r\nO, take her home, mistress, take her home: these blushes of hers must\r\nbe quenched with some present practice.\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nThou sayest true, i’faith so they must; for your bride goes to that\r\nwith shame which is her way to go with warrant.\r\n\r\nBOULT.\r\nFaith, some do and some do not. But, mistress, if I have bargained for\r\nthe joint,—\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nThou mayst cut a morsel off the spit.\r\n\r\nBOULT.\r\nI may so.\r\n\r\nBAWD. Who should deny it? Come young one, I like the manner of your\r\ngarments well.\r\n\r\nBOULT.\r\nAy, by my faith, they shall not be changed yet.\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nBoult, spend thou that in the town: report what a sojourner we have;\r\nyou’ll lose nothing by custom. When nature framed this piece, she meant\r\nthee a good turn; therefore say what a paragon she is, and thou hast\r\nthe harvest out of thine own report.\r\n\r\nBOULT.\r\nI warrant you, mistress, thunder shall not so awake the beds of eels as\r\nmy giving out her beauty stirs up the lewdly inclined. I’ll bring home\r\nsome tonight.\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nCome your ways; follow me.\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nIf fires be hot, knives sharp, or waters deep,\r\nUntied I still my virgin knot will keep.\r\nDiana, aid my purpose!\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nWhat have we to do with Diana? Pray you, will you go with us?\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\nSCENE III. Tarsus. A room in Cleon’s house.\r\n\r\n Enter Cleon and Dionyza.\r\n\r\nDIONYZA.\r\nWhy, are you foolish? Can it be undone?\r\n\r\nCLEON.\r\nO, Dionyza, such a piece of slaughter\r\nThe sun and moon ne’er look’d upon!\r\n\r\nDIONYZA.\r\nI think you’ll turn a child again.\r\n\r\nCLEON.\r\nWere I chief lord of all this spacious world,\r\nI’d give it to undo the deed. A lady,\r\nMuch less in blood than virtue, yet a princess\r\nTo equal any single crown o’ the earth\r\nI’ the justice of compare! O villain Leonine!\r\nWhom thou hast poison’d too:\r\nIf thou hadst drunk to him, ’t had been a kindness\r\nBecoming well thy face. What canst thou say\r\nWhen noble Pericles shall demand his child?\r\n\r\nDIONYZA.\r\nThat she is dead. Nurses are not the fates,\r\nTo foster it, nor ever to preserve.\r\nShe died at night; I’ll say so. Who can cross it?\r\nUnless you play the pious innocent,\r\nAnd for an honest attribute cry out\r\n‘She died by foul play.’\r\n\r\nCLEON.\r\nO, go to. Well, well,\r\nOf all the faults beneath the heavens, the gods\r\nDo like this worst.\r\n\r\nDIONYZA.\r\nBe one of those that thinks\r\nThe petty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence,\r\nAnd open this to Pericles. I do shame\r\nTo think of what a noble strain you are,\r\nAnd of how coward a spirit.\r\n\r\nCLEON.\r\nTo such proceeding\r\nWhoever but his approbation added,\r\nThough not his prime consent, he did not flow\r\nFrom honourable courses.\r\n\r\nDIONYZA.\r\nBe it so, then:\r\nYet none does know, but you, how she came dead,\r\nNor none can know, Leonine being gone.\r\nShe did distain my child, and stood between\r\nHer and her fortunes: none would look on her,\r\nBut cast their gazes on Marina’s face;\r\nWhilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin\r\nNot worth the time of day. It pierced me through;\r\nAnd though you call my course unnatural,\r\nYou not your child well loving, yet I find\r\nIt greets me as an enterprise of kindness\r\nPerform’d to your sole daughter.\r\n\r\nCLEON.\r\nHeavens forgive it!\r\n\r\nDIONYZA.\r\nAnd as for Pericles, what should he say?\r\nWe wept after her hearse, and yet we mourn.\r\nHer monument is almost finish’d, and her epitaphs\r\nIn glittering golden characters express\r\nA general praise to her, and care in us\r\nAt whose expense ’tis done.\r\n\r\nCLEON.\r\nThou art like the harpy,\r\nWhich, to betray, dost, with thine angel’s face,\r\nSeize with thine eagle’s talons.\r\n\r\nDIONYZA.\r\nYou are like one that superstitiously\r\nDoth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies:\r\nBut yet I know you’ll do as I advise.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\nSCENE IV.\r\n\r\n Enter Gower, before the monument of Marina at Tarsus.\r\n\r\nGOWER.\r\nThus time we waste, and long leagues make short;\r\nSail seas in cockles, have and wish but for’t;\r\nMaking, to take your imagination,\r\nFrom bourn to bourn, region to region.\r\nBy you being pardon’d, we commit no crime\r\nTo use one language in each several clime\r\nWhere our scenes seem to live. I do beseech you\r\nTo learn of me, who stand i’the gaps to teach you,\r\nThe stages of our story. Pericles\r\nIs now again thwarting the wayward seas\r\nAttended on by many a lord and knight,\r\nTo see his daughter, all his life’s delight.\r\nOld Helicanus goes along. Behind\r\nIs left to govern, if you bear in mind,\r\nOld Escanes, whom Helicanus late\r\nAdvanced in time to great and high estate.\r\nWell-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought\r\nThis king to Tarsus,—think his pilot thought;\r\nSo with his steerage shall your thoughts go on,—\r\nTo fetch his daughter home, who first is gone.\r\nLike motes and shadows see them move awhile;\r\nYour ears unto your eyes I’ll reconcile.\r\n\r\n Dumb-show. Enter Pericles at one door with all his train; Cleon and\r\n Dionyza at the other. Cleon shows Pericles the tomb; whereat Pericles\r\n makes lamentation, puts on sackcloth and in a mighty passion departs.\r\n Then exeunt Cleon and Dionyza.\r\n\r\nSee how belief may suffer by foul show;\r\nThis borrow’d passion stands for true old woe;\r\nAnd Pericles, in sorrow all devour’d,\r\nWith sighs shot through; and biggest tears o’ershower’d,\r\nLeaves Tarsus and again embarks. He swears\r\nNever to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:\r\nHe puts on sackcloth, and to sea he bears\r\nA tempest, which his mortal vessel tears,\r\nAnd yet he rides it out. Now please you wit\r\nThe epitaph is for Marina writ\r\nBy wicked Dionyza.\r\n\r\n [_Reads the inscription on Marina’s monument._]\r\n\r\n _The fairest, sweet’st, and best lies here,\r\n Who wither’d in her spring of year.\r\n She was of Tyrus the King’s daughter,\r\n On whom foul death hath made this slaughter;\r\n Marina was she call’d; and at her birth,\r\n Thetis, being proud, swallow’d some part o’ the earth:\r\n Therefore the earth, fearing to be o’erflow’d,\r\n Hath Thetis’ birth-child on the heavens bestow’d:\r\n Wherefore she does, and swears she’ll never stint,\r\n Make raging battery upon shores of flint._\r\n\r\nNo visor does become black villany\r\nSo well as soft and tender flattery.\r\nLet Pericles believe his daughter’s dead,\r\nAnd bear his courses to be ordered\r\nBy Lady Fortune; while our scene must play\r\nHis daughter’s woe and heavy well-a-day\r\nIn her unholy service. Patience, then,\r\nAnd think you now are all in Mytilene.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\nSCENE V. Mytilene.

Come, I am for no more bawdy houses: shall’s go hear the\r\nvestals sing?\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\r\nI’ll do anything now that is virtuous; but I am out of the road of\r\nrutting for ever.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\nSCENE VI. The same. A room in the brothel.\r\n\r\n Enter Pandar, Bawd and Boult.\r\n\r\nPANDAR.\r\nWell, I had rather than twice the worth of her she had ne’er come here.\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nFie, fie upon her! She’s able to freeze the god Priapus, and undo a\r\nwhole generation. We must either get her ravished, or be rid of her.\r\nWhen she should do for clients her fitment, and do me the kindness of\r\nour profession, she has me her quirks, her reasons, her master reasons,\r\nher prayers, her knees; that she would make a puritan of the devil, if\r\nhe should cheapen a kiss of her.\r\n\r\nBOULT.\r\nFaith, I must ravish her, or she’ll disfurnish us of all our cavaliers,\r\nand make our swearers priests.\r\n\r\nPANDAR.\r\nNow, the pox upon her green sickness for me!\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nFaith, there’s no way to be rid on’t but by the way to the pox.\r\nHere comes the Lord Lysimachus disguised.\r\n\r\nBOULT.\r\nWe should have both lord and lown, if the peevish baggage would but\r\ngive way to customers.\r\n\r\n Enter Lysimachus.\r\n\r\nLYSIMACHUS.\r\nHow now! How a dozen of virginities?\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nNow, the gods to bless your honour!\r\n\r\nBOULT.\r\nI am glad to see your honour in good health.\r\n\r\nLYSIMACHUS.\r\nYou may so; ’tis the better for you that your resorters stand upon\r\nsound legs. How now? Wholesome iniquity have you that a man may deal\r\nwithal, and defy the surgeon?\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nWe have here one, sir, if she would—but there never came her like in\r\nMytilene.\r\n\r\nLYSIMACHUS.\r\nIf she’d do the deed of darkness, thou wouldst say.\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nYour honour knows what ’tis to say well enough.\r\n\r\nLYSIMACHUS.\r\nWell, call forth, call forth.\r\n\r\nBOULT.\r\nFor flesh and blood, sir, white and red, you shall see a rose; and she\r\nwere a rose indeed, if she had but—\r\n\r\nLYSIMACHUS.\r\nWhat, prithee?\r\n\r\nBOULT.\r\nO, sir, I can be modest.\r\n\r\nLYSIMACHUS.\r\nThat dignifies the renown of a bawd no less than it gives a good report\r\nto a number to be chaste.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Boult._]\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nHere comes that which grows to the stalk; never plucked yet, I can\r\nassure you.\r\n\r\n Re-enter Boult with Marina.\r\n\r\nIs she not a fair creature?\r\n\r\nLYSIMACHUS.\r\nFaith, she would serve after a long voyage at sea.

Pray you, without any more virginal fencing, will you use him\r\nkindly? He will line your apron with gold.\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nWhat he will do graciously, I will thankfully receive.\r\n\r\nLYSIMACHUS.\r\nHa’ you done?\r\n\r\nBAWD.\r\nMy lord, she’s not paced yet: you must take some pains to work her to\r\nyour manage. Come, we will leave his honour and her together. Go thy\r\nways.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Bawd, Pandar and Boult._]\r\n\r\nLYSIMACHUS.\r\nNow, pretty one, how long have you been at this trade?\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nWhat trade, sir?\r\n\r\nLYSIMACHUS.\r\nWhy, I cannot name’t but I shall offend.\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nI cannot be offended with my trade. Please you to name it.\r\n\r\nLYSIMACHUS.\r\nHow long have you been of this profession?\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nE’er since I can remember.\r\n\r\nLYSIMACHUS. Did you go to’t so young? Were you a gamester at five or at\r\nseven?\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nEarlier, too, sir, if now I be one.\r\n\r\nLYSIMACHUS.\r\nWhy, the house you dwell in proclaims you to be a creature of sale.\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nDo you know this house to be a place of such resort, and will come\r\ninto’t? I hear say you are of honourable parts, and are the governor of\r\nthis place.\r\n\r\nLYSIMACHUS.\r\nWhy, hath your principal made known unto you who I am?\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nWho is my principal?\r\n\r\nLYSIMACHUS.\r\nWhy, your herb-woman; she that sets seeds and roots of shame and\r\niniquity. O, you have heard something of my power, and so stand aloof\r\nfor more serious wooing. But I protest to thee, pretty one, my\r\nauthority shall not see thee, or else look friendly upon thee. Come,\r\nbring me to some private place: come, come.\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nIf you were born to honour, show it now;\r\nIf put upon you, make the judgement good\r\nThat thought you worthy of it.\r\n\r\nLYSIMACHUS.\r\nHow’s this? how’s this? Some more; be sage.\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nFor me,\r\nThat am a maid, though most ungentle Fortune\r\nHave placed me in this sty, where, since I came,\r\nDiseases have been sold dearer than physic,\r\nO, that the gods\r\nWould set me free from this unhallow’d place,\r\nThough they did change me to the meanest bird\r\nThat flies i’ the purer air!\r\n\r\nLYSIMACHUS.\r\nI did not think\r\nThou couldst have spoke so well; ne’er dream’d thou couldst.\r\nHad I brought hither a corrupted mind,\r\nThy speech had alter’d it. Hold, here’s gold for thee:\r\nPersever in that clear way thou goest,\r\nAnd the gods strengthen thee!\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nThe good gods preserve you!\r\n\r\nLYSIMACHUS.\r\nFor me, be you thoughten\r\nThat I came with no ill intent; for to me\r\nThe very doors and windows savour vilely.\r\nFare thee well. Thou art a piece of virtue, and\r\nI doubt not but thy training hath been noble.\r\nHold, here’s more gold for thee.\r\nA curse upon him, die he like a thief,\r\nThat robs thee of thy goodness! If thou dost\r\nHear from me, it shall be for thy good.\r\n\r\n Re-enter Boult.\r\n\r\nBOULT.\r\nI beseech your honour, one piece for me.\r\n\r\nLYSIMACHUS.\r\nAvaunt, thou damned door-keeper!\r\nYour house but for this virgin that doth prop it,\r\nWould sink and overwhelm you. Away!\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nBOULT.\r\nHow’s this? We must take another course with you. If your peevish\r\nchastity, which is not worth a breakfast in the cheapest country under\r\nthe cope, shall undo a whole household, let me be gelded like a\r\nspaniel. Come your ways.\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nWhither would you have me?\r\n\r\nBOULT.\r\nI must have your maidenhead taken off, or the common hangman shall\r\nexecute it. Come your ways.

Would she had never come within my doors!\r\nMarry, hang you! She’s born to undo us. Will you not go the way of\r\nwomankind? Marry, come up, my dish of chastity with rosemary and bays!\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nBOULT.\r\nCome, mistress; come your way with me.\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nWhither wilt thou have me?\r\n\r\nBOULT.\r\nTo take from you the jewel you hold so dear.\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nPrithee, tell me one thing first.\r\n\r\nBOULT.\r\nCome now, your one thing?\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nWhat canst thou wish thine enemy to be?\r\n\r\nBOULT.\r\nWhy, I could wish him to be my master, or rather, my mistress.\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nNeither of these are so bad as thou art,\r\nSince they do better thee in their command.\r\nThou hold’st a place, for which the pained’st fiend\r\nOf hell would not in reputation change:\r\nThou art the damned doorkeeper to every\r\nCoistrel that comes inquiring for his Tib.\r\nTo the choleric fisting of every rogue\r\nThy ear is liable, thy food is such\r\nAs hath been belch’d on by infected lungs.\r\n\r\nBOULT.\r\nWhat would you have me do? Go to the wars, would you? where a man may\r\nserve seven years for the loss of a leg, and have not money enough in\r\nthe end to buy him a wooden one?\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nDo anything but this thou doest. Empty\r\nOld receptacles, or common shores, of filth;\r\nServe by indenture to the common hangman:\r\nAny of these ways are yet better than this;\r\nFor what thou professest, a baboon, could he speak,\r\nWould own a name too dear. O, that the gods\r\nWould safely deliver me from this place!\r\nHere, here’s gold for thee.\r\nIf that thy master would gain by me,\r\nProclaim that I can sing, weave, sew, and dance,\r\nWith other virtues, which I’ll keep from boast;\r\nAnd I will undertake all these to teach.\r\nI doubt not but this populous city will\r\nYield many scholars.\r\n\r\nBOULT.\r\nBut can you teach all this you speak of?\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nProve that I cannot, take me home again,\r\nAnd prostitute me to the basest groom\r\nThat doth frequent your house.\r\n\r\nBOULT.\r\nWell, I will see what I can do for thee: if I can place thee, I will.\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nBut amongst honest women.\r\n\r\nBOULT.\r\nFaith, my acquaintance lies little amongst them. But since my master\r\nand mistress have bought you, there’s no going but by their consent:\r\ntherefore I will make them acquainted with your purpose, and I doubt\r\nnot but I shall find them tractable enough. Come, I’ll do for thee what\r\nI can; come your ways.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\nACT V\r\n\n Enter Gower.\r\n\r\nGOWER.\r\nMarina thus the brothel ’scapes, and chances\r\nInto an honest house, our story says.\r\nShe sings like one immortal, and she dances\r\nAs goddess-like to her admired lays;\r\nDeep clerks she dumbs; and with her nee’le composes\r\nNature’s own shape, of bud, bird, branch, or berry,\r\nThat even her art sisters the natural roses;\r\nHer inkle, silk, twin with the rubied cherry:\r\nThat pupils lacks she none of noble race,\r\nWho pour their bounty on her; and her gain\r\nShe gives the cursed bawd. Here we her place;\r\nAnd to her father turn our thoughts again,\r\nWhere we left him, on the sea. We there him lost;\r\nWhence, driven before the winds, he is arrived\r\nHere where his daughter dwells; and on this coast\r\nSuppose him now at anchor. The city strived\r\nGod Neptune’s annual feast to keep: from whence\r\nLysimachus our Tyrian ship espies,\r\nHis banners sable, trimm’d with rich expense;\r\nAnd to him in his barge with fervour hies.\r\nIn your supposing once more put your sight\r\nOf heavy Pericles; think this his bark:\r\nWhere what is done in action, more, if might,\r\nShall be discover’d; please you, sit and hark.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\nSCENE I.

What were thy friends?\r\nDidst thou not say, when I did push thee back—\r\nWhich was when I perceived thee—that thou cam’st\r\nFrom good descending?\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nSo indeed I did.\r\n\r\nPERICLES.\r\nReport thy parentage.

What were thy friends?\r\nHow lost thou them? Thy name, my most kind virgin?\r\nRecount, I do beseech thee: come, sit by me.\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nMy name is Marina.\r\n\r\nPERICLES.\r\nO, I am mock’d,\r\nAnd thou by some incensed god sent hither\r\nTo make the world to laugh at me.\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nPatience, good sir,\r\nOr here I’ll cease.\r\n\r\nPERICLES.\r\nNay, I’ll be patient.\r\nThou little know’st how thou dost startle me,\r\nTo call thyself Marina.\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nThe name\r\nWas given me by one that had some power,\r\nMy father, and a king.\r\n\r\nPERICLES.\r\nHow! a king’s daughter?\r\nAnd call’d Marina?\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nYou said you would believe me;\r\nBut, not to be a troubler of your peace,\r\nI will end here.\r\n\r\nPERICLES.\r\nBut are you flesh and blood?\r\nHave you a working pulse? and are no fairy?\r\nMotion! Well; speak on. Where were you born?\r\nAnd wherefore call’d Marina?\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nCall’d Marina\r\nFor I was born at sea.\r\n\r\nPERICLES.\r\nAt sea! What mother?\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nMy mother was the daughter of a king;\r\nWho died the minute I was born,\r\nAs my good nurse Lychorida hath oft\r\nDeliver’d weeping.\r\n\r\nPERICLES.\r\nO, stop there a little! [_Aside._] This is the rarest dream that e’er\r\ndull sleep\r\nDid mock sad fools withal: this cannot be:\r\nMy daughter, buried.

Yet, give me leave:\r\nHow came you in these parts? Where were you bred?\r\n\r\nMARINA.\r\nThe king my father did in Tarsus leave me;\r\nTill cruel Cleon, with his wicked wife,\r\nDid seek to murder me: and having woo’d\r\nA villain to attempt it, who having drawn to do’t,\r\nA crew of pirates came and rescued me;\r\nBrought me to Mytilene. But, good sir.\r\nWhither will you have me? Why do you weep? It may be,\r\nYou think me an impostor: no, good faith;\r\nI am the daughter to King Pericles,\r\nIf good King Pericles be.\r\n\r\nPERICLES.\r\nHo, Helicanus!\r\n\r\n Enter Helicanus and Lysimachus.\r\n\r\nHELICANUS.\r\nCalls my lord?\r\n\r\nPERICLES.\r\nThou art a grave and noble counsellor,\r\nMost wise in general: tell me, if thou canst,\r\nWhat this maid is, or what is like to be,\r\nThat thus hath made me weep.\r\n\r\nHELICANUS.\r\nI know not,\r\nBut here is the regent, sir, of Mytilene\r\nSpeaks nobly of her.\r\n\r\nLYSIMACHUS.\r\nShe would never tell\r\nHer parentage; being demanded that,\r\nShe would sit still and weep.\r\n\r\nPERICLES.\r\nO Helicanus, strike me, honour’d sir;\r\nGive me a gash, put me to present pain;\r\nLest this great sea of joys rushing upon me\r\nO’erbear the shores of my mortality,\r\nAnd drown me with their sweetness.\r\n[_To Marina_] O, come hither,\r\nThou that beget’st him that did thee beget;\r\nThou that wast born at sea, buried at Tarsus,\r\nAnd found at sea again!

Mine own, Helicanus;\r\nShe is not dead at Tarsus, as she should have been,\r\nBy savage Cleon: she shall tell thee all;\r\nWhen thou shalt kneel, and justify in knowledge\r\nShe is thy very princess. Who is this?\r\n\r\nHELICANUS.\r\nSir, ’tis the governor of Mytilene,\r\nWho, hearing of your melancholy state,\r\nDid come to see you.\r\n\r\nPERICLES.\r\nI embrace you.\r\nGive me my robes. I am wild in my beholding.\r\nO heavens bless my girl! But, hark, what music?\r\nTell Helicanus, my Marina, tell him\r\nO’er, point by point, for yet he seems to doubt,\r\nHow sure you are my daughter. But, what music?\r\n\r\nHELICANUS.\r\nMy lord, I hear none.\r\n\r\nPERICLES.\r\nNone!\r\nThe music of the spheres!

Face to face\r\nAnd frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear\r\nThe accuser and the accused freely speak.\r\nHigh-stomached are they both and full of ire,\r\nIn rage, deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.\r\n\r\nEnter Bolingbroke and Mowbray.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nMany years of happy days befall\r\nMy gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!\r\n\r\nMOWBRAY.\r\nEach day still better other’s happiness\r\nUntil the heavens, envying earth’s good hap,\r\nAdd an immortal title to your crown!\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nWe thank you both. Yet one but flatters us,\r\nAs well appeareth by the cause you come,\r\nNamely, to appeal each other of high treason.\r\nCousin of Hereford, what dost thou object\r\nAgainst the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nFirst—heaven be the record to my speech!—\r\nIn the devotion of a subject’s love,\r\nTend’ring the precious safety of my prince,\r\nAnd free from other misbegotten hate,\r\nCome I appellant to this princely presence.\r\nNow, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,\r\nAnd mark my greeting well; for what I speak\r\nMy body shall make good upon this earth,\r\nOr my divine soul answer it in heaven.\r\nThou art a traitor and a miscreant,\r\nToo good to be so and too bad to live,\r\nSince the more fair and crystal is the sky,\r\nThe uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.\r\nOnce more, the more to aggravate the note,\r\nWith a foul traitor’s name stuff I thy throat,\r\nAnd wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,\r\nWhat my tongue speaks, my right-drawn sword may prove.\r\n\r\nMOWBRAY.\r\nLet not my cold words here accuse my zeal.\r\n’Tis not the trial of a woman’s war,\r\nThe bitter clamour of two eager tongues,\r\nCan arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;\r\nThe blood is hot that must be cooled for this.\r\nYet can I not of such tame patience boast\r\nAs to be hushed and naught at all to say.\r\nFirst, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me\r\nFrom giving reins and spurs to my free speech,\r\nWhich else would post until it had returned\r\nThese terms of treason doubled down his throat.\r\nSetting aside his high blood’s royalty,\r\nAnd let him be no kinsman to my liege,\r\nI do defy him, and I spit at him,\r\nCall him a slanderous coward and a villain;\r\nWhich to maintain, I would allow him odds\r\nAnd meet him, were I tied to run afoot\r\nEven to the frozen ridges of the Alps,\r\nOr any other ground inhabitable\r\nWherever Englishman durst set his foot.\r\nMeantime let this defend my loyalty:\r\nBy all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nPale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,\r\nDisclaiming here the kindred of the King,\r\nAnd lay aside my high blood’s royalty,\r\nWhich fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.\r\nIf guilty dread have left thee so much strength\r\nAs to take up mine honour’s pawn, then stoop.\r\nBy that and all the rites of knighthood else,\r\nWill I make good against thee, arm to arm,\r\nWhat I have spoke or thou canst worst devise.\r\n\r\nMOWBRAY.\r\nI take it up; and by that sword I swear\r\nWhich gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,\r\nI’ll answer thee in any fair degree\r\nOr chivalrous design of knightly trial.\r\nAnd when I mount, alive may I not light\r\nIf I be traitor or unjustly fight!\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nWhat doth our cousin lay to Mowbray’s charge?\r\nIt must be great that can inherit us\r\nSo much as of a thought of ill in him.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nLook what I speak, my life shall prove it true:\r\nThat Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles\r\nIn name of lendings for your highness’ soldiers,\r\nThe which he hath detained for lewd employments,\r\nLike a false traitor and injurious villain.\r\nBesides I say, and will in battle prove,\r\nOr here or elsewhere to the furthest verge\r\nThat ever was surveyed by English eye,\r\nThat all the treasons for these eighteen years\r\nComplotted and contrived in this land\r\nFetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.\r\nFurther I say, and further will maintain\r\nUpon his bad life to make all this good,\r\nThat he did plot the Duke of Gloucester’s death,\r\nSuggest his soon-believing adversaries,\r\nAnd consequently, like a traitor coward,\r\nSluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood,\r\nWhich blood, like sacrificing Abel’s, cries\r\nEven from the tongueless caverns of the earth\r\nTo me for justice and rough chastisement.\r\nAnd, by the glorious worth of my descent,\r\nThis arm shall do it, or this life be spent.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nHow high a pitch his resolution soars!\r\nThomas of Norfolk, what sayst thou to this?\r\n\r\nMOWBRAY.\r\nO! let my sovereign turn away his face\r\nAnd bid his ears a little while be deaf,\r\nTill I have told this slander of his blood\r\nHow God and good men hate so foul a liar.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nMowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears.\r\nWere he my brother, nay, my kingdom’s heir,\r\nAs he is but my father’s brother’s son,\r\nNow, by my sceptre’s awe I make a vow\r\nSuch neighbour nearness to our sacred blood\r\nShould nothing privilege him nor partialize\r\nThe unstooping firmness of my upright soul.\r\nHe is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou.\r\nFree speech and fearless I to thee allow.\r\n\r\nMOWBRAY.\r\nThen, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,\r\nThrough the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.\r\nThree parts of that receipt I had for Calais\r\nDisbursed I duly to his highness’ soldiers;\r\nThe other part reserved I by consent,\r\nFor that my sovereign liege was in my debt\r\nUpon remainder of a dear account\r\nSince last I went to France to fetch his queen.\r\nNow swallow down that lie. For Gloucester’s death,\r\nI slew him not, but to my own disgrace\r\nNeglected my sworn duty in that case.\r\nFor you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,\r\nThe honourable father to my foe,\r\nOnce did I lay an ambush for your life,\r\nA trespass that doth vex my grieved soul;\r\nBut ere I last received the sacrament\r\nI did confess it and exactly begged\r\nYour Grace’s pardon, and I hope I had it.\r\nThis is my fault. As for the rest appealed,\r\nIt issues from the rancour of a villain,\r\nA recreant and most degenerate traitor,\r\nWhich in myself I boldly will defend,\r\nAnd interchangeably hurl down my gage\r\nUpon this overweening traitor’s foot,\r\nTo prove myself a loyal gentleman\r\nEven in the best blood chambered in his bosom.\r\nIn haste whereof most heartily I pray\r\nYour highness to assign our trial day.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nWrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me.\r\nLet’s purge this choler without letting blood.\r\nThis we prescribe, though no physician;\r\nDeep malice makes too deep incision.\r\nForget, forgive, conclude and be agreed;\r\nOur doctors say this is no month to bleed.\r\nGood uncle, let this end where it begun;\r\nWe’ll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.\r\n\r\nGAUNT.\r\nTo be a make-peace shall become my age.\r\nThrow down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk’s gage.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nAnd, Norfolk, throw down his.\r\n\r\nGAUNT.\r\nWhen, Harry, when?\r\nObedience bids I should not bid again.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nNorfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot.\r\n\r\nMOWBRAY.\r\nMyself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot.\r\nMy life thou shalt command, but not my shame.\r\nThe one my duty owes; but my fair name,\r\nDespite of death that lives upon my grave,\r\nTo dark dishonour’s use thou shalt not have.\r\nI am disgraced, impeached, and baffled here,\r\nPierced to the soul with slander’s venomed spear,\r\nThe which no balm can cure but his heart-blood\r\nWhich breathed this poison.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nRage must be withstood.\r\nGive me his gage. Lions make leopards tame.\r\n\r\nMOWBRAY.\r\nYea, but not change his spots. Take but my shame,\r\nAnd I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,\r\nThe purest treasure mortal times afford\r\nIs spotless reputation; that away,\r\nMen are but gilded loam or painted clay.\r\nA jewel in a ten-times-barred-up chest\r\nIs a bold spirit in a loyal breast.\r\nMine honour is my life; both grow in one.\r\nTake honour from me, and my life is done.\r\nThen, dear my liege, mine honour let me try;\r\nIn that I live, and for that will I die.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nCousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nO, God defend my soul from such deep sin!\r\nShall I seem crest-fallen in my father’s sight?\r\nOr with pale beggar-fear impeach my height\r\nBefore this outdared dastard? Ere my tongue\r\nShall wound my honour with such feeble wrong\r\nOr sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear\r\nThe slavish motive of recanting fear\r\nAnd spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,\r\nWhere shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray’s face.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Gaunt._]\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nWe were not born to sue, but to command;\r\nWhich since we cannot do to make you friends,\r\nBe ready, as your lives shall answer it,\r\nAt Coventry upon Saint Lambert’s day.\r\nThere shall your swords and lances arbitrate\r\nThe swelling difference of your settled hate.\r\nSince we cannot atone you, we shall see\r\nJustice design the victor’s chivalry.\r\nLord Marshal, command our officers-at-arms\r\nBe ready to direct these home alarms.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. The same. A room in the Duke of Lancaster’s palace.\r\n\r\n Enter John of Gaunt with the Duchess of Gloucester.\r\n\r\nGAUNT.\r\nAlas, the part I had in Woodstock’s blood\r\nDoth more solicit me than your exclaims\r\nTo stir against the butchers of his life.\r\nBut since correction lieth in those hands\r\nWhich made the fault that we cannot correct,\r\nPut we our quarrel to the will of heaven,\r\nWho, when they see the hours ripe on earth,\r\nWill rain hot vengeance on offenders’ heads.\r\n\r\nDUCHESS.\r\nFinds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?\r\nHath love in thy old blood no living fire?\r\nEdward’s seven sons, whereof thyself art one,\r\nWere as seven vials of his sacred blood,\r\nOr seven fair branches springing from one root.\r\nSome of those seven are dried by nature’s course,\r\nSome of those branches by the Destinies cut;\r\nBut Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,\r\nOne vial full of Edward’s sacred blood,\r\nOne flourishing branch of his most royal root,\r\nIs cracked, and all the precious liquor spilt,\r\nIs hacked down, and his summer leaves all faded,\r\nBy envy’s hand and murder’s bloody axe.\r\nAh, Gaunt! his blood was thine! That bed, that womb,\r\nThat metal, that self mould, that fashioned thee\r\nMade him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,\r\nYet art thou slain in him. Thou dost consent\r\nIn some large measure to thy father’s death\r\nIn that thou seest thy wretched brother die,\r\nWho was the model of thy father’s life.\r\nCall it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair.\r\nIn suff’ring thus thy brother to be slaughtered,\r\nThou showest the naked pathway to thy life,\r\nTeaching stern murder how to butcher thee.\r\nThat which in mean men we entitle patience\r\nIs pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.\r\nWhat shall I say? To safeguard thine own life,\r\nThe best way is to venge my Gloucester’s death.\r\n\r\nGAUNT.\r\nGod’s is the quarrel; for God’s substitute,\r\nHis deputy anointed in His sight,\r\nHath caused his death, the which if wrongfully,\r\nLet heaven revenge, for I may never lift\r\nAn angry arm against His minister.\r\n\r\nDUCHESS.\r\nWhere then, alas! may I complain myself?\r\n\r\nGAUNT.\r\nTo God, the widow’s champion and defence.\r\n\r\nDUCHESS.\r\nWhy then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt.\r\nThou goest to Coventry, there to behold\r\nOur cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight.\r\nO, sit my husband’s wrongs on Hereford’s spear,\r\nThat it may enter butcher Mowbray’s breast!\r\nOr if misfortune miss the first career,\r\nBe Mowbray’s sins so heavy in his bosom\r\nThat they may break his foaming courser’s back\r\nAnd throw the rider headlong in the lists,\r\nA caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!\r\nFarewell, old Gaunt. Thy sometimes brother’s wife\r\nWith her companion, Grief, must end her life.\r\n\r\nGAUNT.\r\nSister, farewell; I must to Coventry.\r\nAs much good stay with thee as go with me!\r\n\r\nDUCHESS.\r\nYet one word more. Grief boundeth where it falls,\r\nNot with the empty hollowness, but weight.\r\nI take my leave before I have begun,\r\nFor sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.\r\nCommend me to thy brother, Edmund York.\r\nLo, this is all. Nay, yet depart not so!\r\nThough this be all, do not so quickly go;\r\nI shall remember more. Bid him—ah, what?—\r\nWith all good speed at Plashy visit me.\r\nAlack, and what shall good old York there see\r\nBut empty lodgings and unfurnished walls,\r\nUnpeopled offices, untrodden stones?\r\nAnd what hear there for welcome but my groans?\r\nTherefore commend me; let him not come there\r\nTo seek out sorrow that dwells everywhere.\r\nDesolate, desolate, will I hence and die!\r\nThe last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. Open Space, near Coventry. Lists set out, and a Throne.\r\nHeralds, &c., attending.\r\n\r\n Enter the Lord Marshal and the Duke of Aumerle.\r\n\r\nMARSHAL.\r\nMy Lord Aumerle, is Harry Hereford armed?\r\n\r\nAUMERLE.\r\nYea, at all points, and longs to enter in.\r\n\r\nMARSHAL.\r\nThe Duke of Norfolk, sprightfully and bold,\r\nStays but the summons of the appelant’s trumpet.\r\n\r\nAUMERLE.\r\nWhy then, the champions are prepared and stay\r\nFor nothing but his Majesty’s approach.\r\n\r\n Enter King Richard, who takes his seat on his Throne; Gaunt, Bushy,\r\n Bagot, Green and others, who take their places. A trumpet is sounded,\r\n and answered by another trumpet within.

His noble hand\r\nDid win what he did spend, and spent not that\r\nWhich his triumphant father’s hand had won.\r\nHis hands were guilty of no kindred’s blood,\r\nBut bloody with the enemies of his kin.\r\nO Richard!

And doth not Hereford live?\r\nWas not Gaunt just? And is not Harry true?\r\nDid not the one deserve to have an heir?\r\nIs not his heir a well-deserving son?\r\nTake Hereford’s rights away, and take from Time\r\nHis charters and his customary rights;\r\nLet not tomorrow then ensue today;\r\nBe not thyself; for how art thou a king\r\nBut by fair sequence and succession?\r\nNow, afore God—God forbid I say true!—\r\nIf you do wrongfully seize Hereford’s rights,\r\nCall in the letters patents that he hath\r\nBy his attorneys-general to sue\r\nHis livery, and deny his offered homage,\r\nYou pluck a thousand dangers on your head,\r\nYou lose a thousand well-disposed hearts,\r\nAnd prick my tender patience to those thoughts\r\nWhich honour and allegiance cannot think.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nThink what you will, we seize into our hands\r\nHis plate, his goods, his money, and his lands.\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nI’ll not be by the while.

Yet I know no cause\r\nWhy I should welcome such a guest as grief,\r\nSave bidding farewell to so sweet a guest\r\nAs my sweet Richard. Yet again methinks,\r\nSome unborn sorrow, ripe in Fortune’s womb,\r\nIs coming towards me, and my inward soul\r\nWith nothing trembles. At something it grieves\r\nMore than with parting from my lord the King.\r\n\r\nBUSHY.\r\nEach substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,\r\nWhich shows like grief itself, but is not so;\r\nFor sorrow’s eye, glazed with blinding tears,\r\nDivides one thing entire to many objects,\r\nLike perspectives which, rightly gazed upon,\r\nShow nothing but confusion; eyed awry,\r\nDistinguish form. So your sweet Majesty,\r\nLooking awry upon your lord’s departure,\r\nFind shapes of grief more than himself to wail,\r\nWhich, looked on as it is, is naught but shadows\r\nOf what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious Queen,\r\nMore than your lord’s departure weep not. More is not seen,\r\nOr if it be, ’tis with false sorrow’s eye,\r\nWhich for things true weeps things imaginary.\r\n\r\nQUEEN.\r\nIt may be so; but yet my inward soul\r\nPersuades me it is otherwise. Howe’er it be,\r\nI cannot but be sad—so heavy sad\r\nAs thought, in thinking, on no thought I think,\r\nMakes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.\r\n\r\nBUSHY.\r\n’Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.\r\n\r\nQUEEN.\r\n’Tis nothing less. Conceit is still derived\r\nFrom some forefather grief. Mine is not so,\r\nFor nothing hath begot my something grief,\r\nOr something hath the nothing that I grieve.\r\n’Tis in reversion that I do possess,\r\nBut what it is, that is not yet known what,\r\nI cannot name. ’Tis nameless woe, I wot.\r\n\r\n Enter Green.\r\n\r\nGREEN.\r\nGod save your majesty! And well met, gentlemen.\r\nI hope the King is not yet shipped for Ireland.\r\n\r\nQUEEN.\r\nWhy hop’st thou so? ’Tis better hope he is,\r\nFor his designs crave haste, his haste good hope.\r\nThen wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipped?\r\n\r\nGREEN.\r\nThat he, our hope, might have retired his power,\r\nAnd driven into despair an enemy’s hope\r\nWho strongly hath set footing in this land.\r\nThe banished Bolingbroke repeals himself,\r\nAnd with uplifted arms is safe arrived\r\nAt Ravenspurgh.\r\n\r\nQUEEN.\r\nNow God in heaven forbid!\r\n\r\nGREEN.\r\nAh, madam, ’tis too true; and that is worse,\r\nThe Lord Northumberland, his son young Harry Percy,\r\nThe Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby,\r\nWith all their powerful friends, are fled to him.\r\n\r\nBUSHY.\r\nWhy have you not proclaimed Northumberland\r\nAnd all the rest revolted faction traitors?\r\n\r\nGREEN.\r\nWe have, whereupon the Earl of Worcester\r\nHath broken his staff, resigned his stewardship,\r\nAnd all the household servants fled with him\r\nTo Bolingbroke.\r\n\r\nQUEEN.\r\nSo, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,\r\nAnd Bolingbroke my sorrow’s dismal heir.\r\nNow hath my soul brought forth her prodigy,\r\nAnd I, a gasping new-delivered mother,\r\nHave woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow joined.\r\n\r\nBUSHY.\r\nDespair not, madam.\r\n\r\nQUEEN.\r\nWho shall hinder me?\r\nI will despair and be at enmity\r\nWith cozening hope. He is a flatterer,\r\nA parasite, a keeper-back of death,\r\nWho gently would dissolve the bands of life,\r\nWhich false hope lingers in extremity.\r\n\r\n Enter York.\r\n\r\nGREEN.\r\nHere comes the Duke of York.\r\n\r\nQUEEN.\r\nWith signs of war about his aged neck.\r\nO! full of careful business are his looks!\r\nUncle, for God’s sake, speak comfortable words.\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nShould I do so, I should belie my thoughts.\r\nComfort’s in heaven, and we are on the earth,\r\nWhere nothing lives but crosses, cares, and grief.\r\nYour husband, he is gone to save far off,\r\nWhilst others come to make him lose at home.\r\nHere am I left to underprop his land,\r\nWho, weak with age, cannot support myself.\r\nNow comes the sick hour that his surfeit made;\r\nNow shall he try his friends that flattered him.\r\n\r\n Enter a Servingman.\r\n\r\nSERVINGMAN.\r\nMy lord, your son was gone before I came.\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nHe was? Why, so! Go all which way it will!\r\nThe nobles they are fled, the commons they are cold\r\nAnd will, I fear, revolt on Hereford’s side.\r\nSirrah, get thee to Plashy, to my sister Gloucester;\r\nBid her send me presently a thousand pound.\r\nHold, take my ring.\r\n\r\nSERVINGMAN.\r\nMy lord, I had forgot to tell your lordship:\r\nToday, as I came by, I called there—\r\nBut I shall grieve you to report the rest.\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nWhat is’t, knave?\r\n\r\nSERVINGMAN.\r\nAn hour before I came, the Duchess died.\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nGod for his mercy, what a tide of woes\r\nComes rushing on this woeful land at once!\r\nI know not what to do. I would to God,\r\nSo my untruth had not provoked him to it,\r\nThe King had cut off my head with my brother’s.\r\nWhat, are there no posts dispatched for Ireland?\r\nHow shall we do for money for these wars?\r\nCome, sister—cousin, I would say, pray, pardon me.\r\nGo, fellow, get thee home; provide some carts\r\nAnd bring away the armour that is there.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Servingman._]\r\n\r\nGentlemen, will you go muster men?\r\nIf I know how or which way to order these affairs\r\nThus disorderly thrust into my hands,\r\nNever believe me. Both are my kinsmen.\r\nTh’ one is my sovereign, whom both my oath\r\nAnd duty bids defend; th’ other again\r\nIs my kinsman, whom the King hath wronged,\r\nWhom conscience and my kindred bids to right.\r\nWell, somewhat we must do. Come, cousin,\r\nI’ll dispose of you. Gentlemen, go muster up your men,\r\nAnd meet me presently at Berkeley Castle.\r\nI should to Plashy too,\r\nBut time will not permit. All is uneven,\r\nAnd everything is left at six and seven.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt York and Queen._]\r\n\r\nBUSHY.\r\nThe wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland,\r\nBut none returns. For us to levy power\r\nProportionable to the enemy\r\nIs all unpossible.\r\n\r\nGREEN.\r\nBesides, our nearness to the King in love\r\nIs near the hate of those love not the King.\r\n\r\nBAGOT.\r\nAnd that is the wavering commons, for their love\r\nLies in their purses; and whoso empties them,\r\nBy so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.\r\n\r\nBUSHY.\r\nWherein the King stands generally condemned.\r\n\r\nBAGOT.\r\nIf judgment lie in them, then so do we,\r\nBecause we ever have been near the King.\r\n\r\nGREEN.\r\nWell, I will for refuge straight to Bristol Castle.\r\nThe Earl of Wiltshire is already there.\r\n\r\nBUSHY.\r\nThither will I with you, for little office\r\nWill the hateful commons perform for us,\r\nExcept like curs to tear us all to pieces.\r\nWill you go along with us?\r\n\r\nBAGOT.\r\nNo, I will to Ireland to his Majesty.\r\nFarewell. If heart’s presages be not vain,\r\nWe three here part that ne’er shall meet again.\r\n\r\nBUSHY.\r\nThat’s as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.\r\n\r\nGREEN.\r\nAlas, poor Duke! The task he undertakes\r\nIs numb’ring sands and drinking oceans dry.\r\nWhere one on his side fights, thousands will fly.\r\nFarewell at once, for once, for all, and ever.\r\n\r\nBUSHY.\r\nWell, we may meet again.\r\n\r\nBAGOT.\r\nI fear me, never.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. The Wolds in Gloucestershire.\r\n\r\n Enter Bolingbroke and Northumberland with Forces.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nHow far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?\r\n\r\nNORTHUMBERLAND.\r\nBelieve me, noble lord,\r\nI am a stranger here in Gloucestershire.\r\nThese high wild hills and rough uneven ways\r\nDraws out our miles and makes them wearisome.\r\nAnd yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,\r\nMaking the hard way sweet and delectable.\r\nBut I bethink me what a weary way\r\nFrom Ravenspurgh to Cotshall will be found\r\nIn Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,\r\nWhich, I protest, hath very much beguiled\r\nThe tediousness and process of my travel.\r\nBut theirs is sweetened with the hope to have\r\nThe present benefit which I possess;\r\nAnd hope to joy is little less in joy\r\nThan hope enjoyed. By this the weary lords\r\nShall make their way seem short as mine hath done\r\nBy sight of what I have, your noble company.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nOf much less value is my company\r\nThan your good words. But who comes here?\r\n\r\n Enter Harry Percy.\r\n\r\nNORTHUMBERLAND.\r\nIt is my son, young Harry Percy,\r\nSent from my brother Worcester, whencesoever.\r\nHarry, how fares your uncle?\r\n\r\nPERCY.\r\nI had thought, my lord, to have learned his health of you.\r\n\r\nNORTHUMBERLAND.\r\nWhy, is he not with the Queen?\r\n\r\nPERCY.\r\nNo, my good lord. He hath forsook the court,\r\nBroken his staff of office, and dispersed\r\nThe household of the King.\r\n\r\nNORTHUMBERLAND.\r\nWhat was his reason?\r\nHe was not so resolved when last we spake together.\r\n\r\nPERCY.\r\nBecause your lordship was proclaimed traitor.\r\nBut he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh\r\nTo offer service to the Duke of Hereford,\r\nAnd sent me over by Berkeley to discover\r\nWhat power the Duke of York had levied there,\r\nThen with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh.\r\n\r\nNORTHUMBERLAND.\r\nHave you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?\r\n\r\nPERCY.\r\nNo, my good lord; for that is not forgot\r\nWhich ne’er I did remember. To my knowledge,\r\nI never in my life did look on him.\r\n\r\nNORTHUMBERLAND.\r\nThen learn to know him now. This is the Duke.\r\n\r\nPERCY.\r\nMy gracious lord, I tender you my service,\r\nSuch as it is, being tender, raw, and young,\r\nWhich elder days shall ripen and confirm\r\nTo more approved service and desert.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nI thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure\r\nI count myself in nothing else so happy\r\nAs in a soul rememb’ring my good friends;\r\nAnd as my fortune ripens with thy love,\r\nIt shall be still thy true love’s recompense.\r\nMy heart this covenant makes, my hand thus seals it.\r\n\r\nNORTHUMBERLAND.\r\nHow far is it to Berkeley, and what stir\r\nKeeps good old York there with his men of war?\r\n\r\nPERCY.\r\nThere stands the castle by yon tuft of trees,\r\nManned with three hundred men, as I have heard.\r\nAnd in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour,\r\nNone else of name and noble estimate.\r\n\r\n Enter Ross and Willoughby.\r\n\r\nNORTHUMBERLAND.\r\nHere come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,\r\nBloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nWelcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues\r\nA banished traitor. All my treasury\r\nIs yet but unfelt thanks, which, more enriched,\r\nShall be your love and labour’s recompense.\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nYour presence makes us rich, most noble lord.\r\n\r\nWILLOUGHBY.\r\nAnd far surmounts our labour to attain it.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nEvermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor;\r\nWhich, till my infant fortune comes to years,\r\nStands for my bounty. But who comes here?\r\n\r\n Enter Berkeley.\r\n\r\nNORTHUMBERLAND.\r\nIt is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess.\r\n\r\nBERKELEY.\r\nMy Lord of Hereford, my message is to you.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nMy lord, my answer is—to “Lancaster”,\r\nAnd I am come to seek that name in England;\r\nAnd I must find that title in your tongue\r\nBefore I make reply to aught you say.\r\n\r\nBERKELEY.\r\nMistake me not, my lord, ’tis not my meaning\r\nTo rase one title of your honour out.\r\nTo you, my lord, I come, what lord you will,\r\nFrom the most gracious regent of this land,\r\nThe Duke of York, to know what pricks you on\r\nTo take advantage of the absent time,\r\nAnd fright our native peace with self-borne arms.\r\n\r\n Enter York, attended.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nI shall not need transport my words by you.\r\nHere comes his Grace in person. My noble uncle!\r\n\r\n [_Kneels._]\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nShow me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,\r\nWhose duty is deceivable and false.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nMy gracious uncle—\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nTut, tut!\r\nGrace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle.\r\nI am no traitor’s uncle, and that word “grace”\r\nIn an ungracious mouth is but profane.\r\nWhy have those banished and forbidden legs\r\nDared once to touch a dust of England’s ground?\r\nBut then more why: why have they dared to march\r\nSo many miles upon her peaceful bosom,\r\nFrighting her pale-faced villages with war\r\nAnd ostentation of despised arms?\r\nCom’st thou because the anointed king is hence?\r\nWhy, foolish boy, the King is left behind,\r\nAnd in my loyal bosom lies his power.\r\nWere I but now lord of such hot youth\r\nAs when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself\r\nRescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,\r\nFrom forth the ranks of many thousand French,\r\nO, then how quickly should this arm of mine,\r\nNow prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee\r\nAnd minister correction to thy fault!\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nMy gracious uncle, let me know my fault.\r\nOn what condition stands it and wherein?\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nEven in condition of the worst degree,\r\nIn gross rebellion and detested treason.\r\nThou art a banished man, and here art come,\r\nBefore the expiration of thy time,\r\nIn braving arms against thy sovereign.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nAs I was banished, I was banished Hereford;\r\nBut as I come, I come for Lancaster.\r\nAnd, noble uncle, I beseech your Grace\r\nLook on my wrongs with an indifferent eye.\r\nYou are my father, for methinks in you\r\nI see old Gaunt alive. O then, my father,\r\nWill you permit that I shall stand condemned\r\nA wandering vagabond, my rights and royalties\r\nPlucked from my arms perforce and given away\r\nTo upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?\r\nIf that my cousin king be King in England,\r\nIt must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.\r\nYou have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin.\r\nHad you first died and he been thus trod down,\r\nHe should have found his uncle Gaunt a father\r\nTo rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.\r\nI am denied to sue my livery here,\r\nAnd yet my letters patents give me leave.\r\nMy father’s goods are all distrained and sold,\r\nAnd these, and all, are all amiss employed.\r\nWhat would you have me do? I am a subject,\r\nAnd challenge law. Attorneys are denied me,\r\nAnd therefore personally I lay my claim\r\nTo my inheritance of free descent.\r\n\r\nNORTHUMBERLAND.\r\nThe noble Duke hath been too much abused.\r\n\r\nROSS.\r\nIt stands your Grace upon to do him right.\r\n\r\nWILLOUGHBY.\r\nBase men by his endowments are made great.\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nMy lords of England, let me tell you this:\r\nI have had feeling of my cousin’s wrongs\r\nAnd laboured all I could to do him right.\r\nBut in this kind to come, in braving arms,\r\nBe his own carver and cut out his way\r\nTo find out right with wrong, it may not be.\r\nAnd you that do abet him in this kind\r\nCherish rebellion and are rebels all.\r\n\r\nNORTHUMBERLAND.\r\nThe noble Duke hath sworn his coming is\r\nBut for his own; and for the right of that\r\nWe all have strongly sworn to give him aid;\r\nAnd let him never see joy that breaks that oath!\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nWell, well, I see the issue of these arms.\r\nI cannot mend it, I must needs confess,\r\nBecause my power is weak and all ill-left;\r\nBut if I could, by Him that gave me life,\r\nI would attach you all and make you stoop\r\nUnto the sovereign mercy of the King.\r\nBut since I cannot, be it known unto you\r\nI do remain as neuter. So fare you well—\r\nUnless you please to enter in the castle\r\nAnd there repose you for this night.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nAn offer, uncle, that we will accept;\r\nBut we must win your Grace to go with us\r\nTo Bristol Castle, which they say is held\r\nBy Bushy, Bagot, and their complices,\r\nThe caterpillars of the commonwealth,\r\nWhich I have sworn to weed and pluck away.\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nIt may be I will go with you; but yet I’ll pause,\r\nFor I am loath to break our country’s laws.\r\nNor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are.\r\nThings past redress are now with me past care.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV. A camp in Wales.\r\n\r\n Enter Earl of Salisbury and a Welsh Captain.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN.\r\nMy Lord of Salisbury, we have stayed ten days\r\nAnd hardly kept our countrymen together,\r\nAnd yet we hear no tidings from the King.\r\nTherefore we will disperse ourselves. Farewell.\r\n\r\nSALISBURY.\r\nStay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman.\r\nThe King reposeth all his confidence in thee.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN.\r\n’Tis thought the King is dead. We will not stay.\r\nThe bay trees in our country are all withered,\r\nAnd meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven;\r\nThe pale-faced moon looks bloody on the earth,\r\nAnd lean-looked prophets whisper fearful change;\r\nRich men look sad, and ruffians dance and leap,\r\nThe one in fear to lose what they enjoy,\r\nThe other to enjoy by rage and war.\r\nThese signs forerun the death or fall of kings.\r\nFarewell. Our countrymen are gone and fled,\r\nAs well assured Richard their king is dead.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSALISBURY.\r\nAh, Richard! With the eyes of heavy mind\r\nI see thy glory like a shooting star\r\nFall to the base earth from the firmament.\r\nThy sun sets weeping in the lowly west,\r\nWitnessing storms to come, woe, and unrest.\r\nThy friends are fled, to wait upon thy foes,\r\nAnd crossly to thy good all fortune goes.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\nACT III\r\n\r\nSCENE I.

Bolingbroke’s camp.\r\n\n Enter Bolingbroke, York, Northumberland, Harry Percy, Willoughby,\r\n Ross; Officers behind, with Bushy and Green, prisoners.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nBring forth these men.\r\nBushy and Green, I will not vex your souls—\r\nSince presently your souls must part your bodies—\r\nWith too much urging your pernicious lives,\r\nFor ’twere no charity; yet to wash your blood\r\nFrom off my hands, here in the view of men\r\nI will unfold some causes of your deaths:\r\nYou have misled a prince, a royal king,\r\nA happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,\r\nBy you unhappied and disfigured clean.\r\nYou have in manner with your sinful hours\r\nMade a divorce betwixt his queen and him,\r\nBroke the possession of a royal bed,\r\nAnd stained the beauty of a fair queen’s cheeks\r\nWith tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs.\r\nMyself, a prince by fortune of my birth,\r\nNear to the King in blood, and near in love\r\nTill you did make him misinterpret me,\r\nHave stooped my neck under your injuries\r\nAnd sighed my English breath in foreign clouds,\r\nEating the bitter bread of banishment,\r\nWhilst you have fed upon my signories,\r\nDisparked my parks and felled my forest woods,\r\nFrom my own windows torn my household coat,\r\nRased out my imprese, leaving me no sign\r\nSave men’s opinions and my living blood\r\nTo show the world I am a gentleman.\r\nThis and much more, much more than twice all this,\r\nCondemns you to the death. See them delivered over\r\nTo execution and the hand of death.\r\n\r\nBUSHY.\r\nMore welcome is the stroke of death to me\r\nThan Bolingbroke to England. Lords, farewell.\r\n\r\nGREEN.\r\nMy comfort is that heaven will take our souls\r\nAnd plague injustice with the pains of hell.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nMy Lord Northumberland, see them dispatched.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Northumberland and Others, with Bushy and Green._]\r\n\r\nUncle, you say the Queen is at your house;\r\nFor God’s sake, fairly let her be entreated.\r\nTell her I send to her my kind commends;\r\nTake special care my greetings be delivered.\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nA gentleman of mine I have dispatched\r\nWith letters of your love to her at large.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nThanks, gentle uncle. Come, lords, away,\r\nTo fight with Glendower and his complices.\r\nA while to work, and after holiday.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. The coast of Wales. A castle in view.\r\n\r\n Flourish: drums and trumpets. Enter King Richard, the Bishop of\r\n Carlisle, Aumerle and soldiers.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nBarkloughly Castle call they this at hand?\r\n\r\nAUMERLE.\r\nYea, my lord. How brooks your Grace the air\r\nAfter your late tossing on the breaking seas?\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nNeeds must I like it well. I weep for joy\r\nTo stand upon my kingdom once again.\r\nDear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,\r\nThough rebels wound thee with their horses’ hoofs.\r\nAs a long-parted mother with her child\r\nPlays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,\r\nSo weeping-smiling greet I thee, my earth,\r\nAnd do thee favours with my royal hands.\r\nFeed not thy sovereign’s foe, my gentle earth,\r\nNor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense,\r\nBut let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom,\r\nAnd heavy-gaited toads lie in their way,\r\nDoing annoyance to the treacherous feet\r\nWhich with usurping steps do trample thee.\r\nYield stinging nettles to mine enemies;\r\nAnd when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,\r\nGuard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder\r\nWhose double tongue may with a mortal touch\r\nThrow death upon thy sovereign’s enemies.\r\nMock not my senseless conjuration, lords.\r\nThis earth shall have a feeling, and these stones\r\nProve armed soldiers, ere her native king\r\nShall falter under foul rebellion’s arms.\r\n\r\nCARLISLE.\r\nFear not, my lord. That Power that made you king\r\nHath power to keep you king in spite of all.\r\nThe means that heaven yields must be embraced\r\nAnd not neglected; else if heaven would,\r\nAnd we will not. Heaven’s offer we refuse,\r\nThe proffered means of succour and redress.\r\n\r\nAUMERLE.\r\nHe means, my lord, that we are too remiss,\r\nWhilst Bolingbroke, through our security,\r\nGrows strong and great in substance and in power.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nDiscomfortable cousin, know’st thou not\r\nThat when the searching eye of heaven is hid\r\nBehind the globe that lights the lower world,\r\nThen thieves and robbers range abroad unseen\r\nIn murders and in outrage boldly here;\r\nBut when from under this terrestrial ball\r\nHe fires the proud tops of the eastern pines\r\nAnd darts his light through every guilty hole,\r\nThen murders, treasons, and detested sins,\r\nThe cloak of night being plucked from off their backs,\r\nStand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?\r\nSo when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,\r\nWho all this while hath revelled in the night\r\nWhilst we were wand’ring with the Antipodes,\r\nShall see us rising in our throne, the east,\r\nHis treasons will sit blushing in his face,\r\nNot able to endure the sight of day,\r\nBut self-affrighted, tremble at his sin.\r\nNot all the water in the rough rude sea\r\nCan wash the balm off from an anointed king;\r\nThe breath of worldly men cannot depose\r\nThe deputy elected by the Lord.\r\nFor every man that Bolingbroke hath pressed\r\nTo lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,\r\nGod for his Richard hath in heavenly pay\r\nA glorious angel. Then, if angels fight,\r\nWeak men must fall, for heaven still guards the right.\r\n\r\n Enter Salisbury.\r\n\r\nWelcome, my lord. How far off lies your power?\r\n\r\nSALISBURY.\r\nNor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,\r\nThan this weak arm. Discomfort guides my tongue\r\nAnd bids me speak of nothing but despair.\r\nOne day too late, I fear me, noble lord,\r\nHath clouded all thy happy days on earth.\r\nO, call back yesterday, bid time return,\r\nAnd thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men!\r\nToday, today, unhappy day, too late,\r\nO’erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune, and thy state;\r\nFor all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead,\r\nAre gone to Bolingbroke, dispersed, and fled.\r\n\r\nAUMERLE.\r\nComfort, my liege. Why looks your Grace so pale?\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nBut now, the blood of twenty thousand men\r\nDid triumph in my face, and they are fled;\r\nAnd till so much blood thither come again\r\nHave I not reason to look pale and dead?\r\nAll souls that will be safe, fly from my side,\r\nFor time hath set a blot upon my pride.\r\n\r\nAUMERLE.\r\nComfort, my liege. Remember who you are.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nI had forgot myself. Am I not king?\r\nAwake, thou coward majesty! thou sleepest!\r\nIs not the King’s name twenty thousand names?\r\nArm, arm, my name! A puny subject strikes\r\nAt thy great glory. Look not to the ground,\r\nYe favourites of a king. Are we not high?\r\nHigh be our thoughts. I know my uncle York\r\nHath power enough to serve our turn. But who comes here?\r\n\r\n Enter Sir Stephen Scroop.\r\n\r\nSCROOP.\r\nMore health and happiness betide my liege\r\nThan can my care-tuned tongue deliver him.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nMine ear is open and my heart prepared.\r\nThe worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold.\r\nSay, is my kingdom lost? Why, ’twas my care,\r\nAnd what loss is it to be rid of care?\r\nStrives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?\r\nGreater he shall not be. If he serve God,\r\nWe’ll serve Him too, and be his fellow so.\r\nRevolt our subjects? That we cannot mend.\r\nThey break their faith to God as well as us.\r\nCry woe, destruction, ruin, loss, decay.\r\nThe worst is death, and death will have his day.\r\n\r\nSCROOP.\r\nGlad am I that your highness is so armed\r\nTo bear the tidings of calamity.\r\nLike an unseasonable stormy day\r\nWhich makes the silver rivers drown their shores\r\nAs if the world were all dissolved to tears,\r\nSo high above his limits swells the rage\r\nOf Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land\r\nWith hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.\r\nWhitebeards have armed their thin and hairless scalps\r\nAgainst thy majesty; boys with women’s voices\r\nStrive to speak big and clap their female joints\r\nIn stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown;\r\nThy very beadsmen learn to bend their bows\r\nOf double-fatal yew against thy state;\r\nYea, distaff-women manage rusty bills\r\nAgainst thy seat. Both young and old rebel,\r\nAnd all goes worse than I have power to tell.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nToo well, too well thou tell’st a tale so ill.\r\nWhere is the Earl of Wiltshire? Where is Bagot?\r\nWhat is become of Bushy? Where is Green?\r\nThat they have let the dangerous enemy\r\nMeasure our confines with such peaceful steps?\r\nIf we prevail, their heads shall pay for it.\r\nI warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke.\r\n\r\nSCROOP.\r\nPeace have they made with him indeed, my lord.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nO villains, vipers, damned without redemption!\r\nDogs, easily won to fawn on any man!\r\nSnakes, in my heart-blood warmed, that sting my heart!\r\nThree Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas!\r\nWould they make peace? Terrible hell\r\nMake war upon their spotted souls for this!\r\n\r\nSCROOP.\r\nSweet love, I see, changing his property,\r\nTurns to the sourest and most deadly hate.\r\nAgain uncurse their souls. Their peace is made\r\nWith heads, and not with hands. Those whom you curse\r\nHave felt the worst of death’s destroying wound\r\nAnd lie full low, graved in the hollow ground.\r\n\r\nAUMERLE.\r\nIs Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?\r\n\r\nSCROOP.\r\nAy, all of them at Bristol lost their heads.\r\n\r\nAUMERLE.\r\nWhere is the Duke my father with his power?\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nNo matter where. Of comfort no man speak!\r\nLet’s talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs,\r\nMake dust our paper, and with rainy eyes\r\nWrite sorrow on the bosom of the earth.\r\nLet’s choose executors and talk of wills.\r\nAnd yet not so, for what can we bequeath\r\nSave our deposed bodies to the ground?\r\nOur lands, our lives, and all are Bolingbroke’s,\r\nAnd nothing can we call our own but death\r\nAnd that small model of the barren earth\r\nWhich serves as paste and cover to our bones.\r\nFor God’s sake let us sit upon the ground\r\nAnd tell sad stories of the death of kings—\r\nHow some have been deposed, some slain in war,\r\nSome haunted by the ghosts they have deposed,\r\nSome poisoned by their wives, some sleeping killed,\r\nAll murdered. For within the hollow crown\r\nThat rounds the mortal temples of a king\r\nKeeps Death his court; and there the antic sits,\r\nScoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,\r\nAllowing him a breath, a little scene,\r\nTo monarchize, be feared, and kill with looks,\r\nInfusing him with self and vain conceit,\r\nAs if this flesh which walls about our life\r\nWere brass impregnable; and, humoured thus,\r\nComes at the last, and with a little pin\r\nBores through his castle wall, and farewell, king!\r\nCover your heads, and mock not flesh and blood\r\nWith solemn reverence. Throw away respect,\r\nTradition, form, and ceremonious duty,\r\nFor you have but mistook me all this while.\r\nI live with bread like you, feel want,\r\nTaste grief, need friends. Subjected thus,\r\nHow can you say to me I am a king?\r\n\r\nCARLISLE.\r\nMy lord, wise men ne’er sit and wail their woes,\r\nBut presently prevent the ways to wail.\r\nTo fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,\r\nGives in your weakness strength unto your foe,\r\nAnd so your follies fight against yourself.\r\nFear and be slain—no worse can come to fight;\r\nAnd fight and die is death destroying death,\r\nWhere fearing dying pays death servile breath.\r\n\r\nAUMERLE.\r\nMy father hath a power. Enquire of him,\r\nAnd learn to make a body of a limb.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nThou chid’st me well. Proud Bolingbroke, I come\r\nTo change blows with thee for our day of doom.\r\nThis ague fit of fear is overblown;\r\nAn easy task it is to win our own.\r\nSay, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?\r\nSpeak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour.\r\n\r\nSCROOP.\r\nMen judge by the complexion of the sky\r\nThe state in inclination of the day;\r\nSo may you by my dull and heavy eye.\r\nMy tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.\r\nI play the torturer by small and small\r\nTo lengthen out the worst that must be spoken:\r\nYour uncle York is joined with Bolingbroke,\r\nAnd all your northern castles yielded up,\r\nAnd all your southern gentlemen in arms\r\nUpon his party.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nThou hast said enough.\r\n[_To Aumerle_.] Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth\r\nOf that sweet way I was in to despair.\r\nWhat say you now? What comfort have we now?\r\nBy heaven, I’ll hate him everlastingly\r\nThat bids me be of comfort any more.\r\nGo to Flint Castle. There I’ll pine away;\r\nA king, woe’s slave, shall kingly woe obey.\r\nThat power I have, discharge, and let them go\r\nTo ear the land that hath some hope to grow,\r\nFor I have none. Let no man speak again\r\nTo alter this, for counsel is but vain.\r\n\r\nAUMERLE.\r\nMy liege, one word.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nHe does me double wrong\r\nThat wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue.\r\nDischarge my followers. Let them hence away,\r\nFrom Richard’s night to Bolingbroke’s fair day.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. Wales. Before Flint Castle.\r\n\r\n Enter, with drum and colours, Bolingbroke and Forces; Northumberland\r\n and Others.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nSo that by this intelligence we learn\r\nThe Welshmen are dispersed, and Salisbury\r\nIs gone to meet the King, who lately landed\r\nWith some few private friends upon this coast.\r\n\r\nNORTHUMBERLAND.\r\nThe news is very fair and good, my lord:\r\nRichard not far from hence hath hid his head.\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nIt would beseem the Lord Northumberland\r\nTo say “King Richard”. Alack the heavy day\r\nWhen such a sacred king should hide his head!\r\n\r\nNORTHUMBERLAND.\r\nYour Grace mistakes; only to be brief\r\nLeft I his title out.\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nThe time hath been,\r\nWould you have been so brief with him, he would\r\nHave been so brief with you to shorten you,\r\nFor taking so the head, your whole head’s length.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nMistake not, uncle, further than you should.\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nTake not, good cousin, further than you should,\r\nLest you mistake. The heavens are o’er our heads.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nI know it, uncle, and oppose not myself\r\nAgainst their will. But who comes here?\r\n\r\n Enter Harry Percy.\r\n\r\nWelcome, Harry. What, will not this castle yield?\r\n\r\nPERCY.\r\nThe castle royally is manned, my lord,\r\nAgainst thy entrance.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nRoyally!\r\nWhy, it contains no king?\r\n\r\nPERCY.\r\nYes, my good lord,\r\nIt doth contain a king. King Richard lies\r\nWithin the limits of yon lime and stone,\r\nAnd with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury,\r\nSir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman\r\nOf holy reverence—who, I cannot learn.\r\n\r\nNORTHUMBERLAND.\r\nO, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\n[_To Northumberland_.] Noble lord,\r\nGo to the rude ribs of that ancient castle;\r\nThrough brazen trumpet send the breath of parley\r\nInto his ruined ears, and thus deliver:\r\nHenry Bolingbroke\r\nOn both his knees doth kiss King Richard’s hand\r\nAnd sends allegiance and true faith of heart\r\nTo his most royal person, hither come\r\nEven at his feet to lay my arms and power,\r\nProvided that my banishment repealed\r\nAnd lands restored again be freely granted.\r\nIf not, I’ll use the advantage of my power\r\nAnd lay the summer’s dust with showers of blood\r\nRained from the wounds of slaughtered Englishmen—\r\nThe which how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke\r\nIt is such crimson tempest should bedrench\r\nThe fresh green lap of fair King Richard’s land,\r\nMy stooping duty tenderly shall show.\r\nGo signify as much, while here we march\r\nUpon the grassy carpet of this plain.\r\nLet’s march without the noise of threat’ning drum,\r\nThat from this castle’s tottered battlements\r\nOur fair appointments may be well perused.\r\nMethinks King Richard and myself should meet\r\nWith no less terror than the elements\r\nOf fire and water, when their thund’ring shock\r\nAt meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.\r\nBe he the fire, I’ll be the yielding water;\r\nThe rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain\r\nMy waters—on the earth, and not on him.\r\nMarch on, and mark King Richard how he looks.\r\n\r\n A parley sounded, and answered by a trumpet within. Flourish. Enter on\r\n the Walls, the King, the Bishop of Carlisle, Aumerle, Scroop and\r\n Salisbury\r\n\nSee, see, King Richard doth himself appear,\r\nAs doth the blushing discontented sun\r\nFrom out the fiery portal of the east,\r\nWhen he perceives the envious clouds are bent\r\nTo dim his glory and to stain the track\r\nOf his bright passage to the occident.\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nYet he looks like a king. Behold, his eye,\r\nAs bright as is the eagle’s, lightens forth\r\nControlling majesty. Alack, alack, for woe\r\nThat any harm should stain so fair a show!\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\n[_To Northumberland._] We are amazed, and thus long have we stood\r\nTo watch the fearful bending of thy knee\r\nBecause we thought ourself thy lawful king.\r\nAnd if we be, how dare thy joints forget\r\nTo pay their awful duty to our presence?\r\nIf we be not, show us the hand of God\r\nThat hath dismissed us from our stewardship;\r\nFor well we know no hand of blood and bone\r\nCan gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre,\r\nUnless he do profane, steal, or usurp.\r\nAnd though you think that all, as you have done,\r\nHave torn their souls by turning them from us,\r\nAnd we are barren and bereft of friends,\r\nYet know: my master, God omnipotent,\r\nIs mustering in his clouds on our behalf\r\nArmies of pestilence, and they shall strike\r\nYour children yet unborn and unbegot,\r\nThat lift your vassal hands against my head\r\nAnd threat the glory of my precious crown.\r\nTell Bolingbroke—for yon methinks he stands—\r\nThat every stride he makes upon my land\r\nIs dangerous treason. He is come to open\r\nThe purple testament of bleeding war;\r\nBut ere the crown he looks for live in peace,\r\nTen thousand bloody crowns of mothers’ sons\r\nShall ill become the flower of England’s face,\r\nChange the complexion of her maid-pale peace\r\nTo scarlet indignation, and bedew\r\nHer pastures’ grass with faithful English blood.\r\n\r\nNORTHUMBERLAND.\r\nThe King of Heaven forbid our lord the King\r\nShould so with civil and uncivil arms\r\nBe rushed upon! Thy thrice-noble cousin,\r\nHarry Bolingbroke, doth humbly kiss thy hand;\r\nAnd by the honourable tomb he swears\r\nThat stands upon your royal grandsire’s bones,\r\nAnd by the royalties of both your bloods,\r\nCurrents that spring from one most gracious head,\r\nAnd by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt,\r\nAnd by the worth and honour of himself,\r\nComprising all that may be sworn or said,\r\nHis coming hither hath no further scope\r\nThan for his lineal royalties, and to beg\r\nEnfranchisement immediate on his knees;\r\nWhich on thy royal party granted once,\r\nHis glittering arms he will commend to rust,\r\nHis barbed steeds to stables, and his heart\r\nTo faithful service of your Majesty.\r\nThis swears he, as he is a prince and just;\r\nAnd as I am a gentleman I credit him.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nNorthumberland, say, thus the King returns:\r\nHis noble cousin is right welcome hither,\r\nAnd all the number of his fair demands\r\nShall be accomplished without contradiction.\r\nWith all the gracious utterance thou hast,\r\nSpeak to his gentle hearing kind commends.\r\n\r\n [_Northumberland returns to Bolingbroke._]\r\n\r\n[_To Aumerle_.] We do debase ourselves, cousin, do we not,\r\nTo look so poorly and to speak so fair?\r\nShall we call back Northumberland and send\r\nDefiance to the traitor, and so die?\r\n\r\nAUMERLE.\r\nNo, good my lord. Let’s fight with gentle words\r\nTill time lend friends, and friends their helpful swords.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nO God, O God, that e’er this tongue of mine\r\nThat laid the sentence of dread banishment\r\nOn yon proud man should take it off again\r\nWith words of sooth! O, that I were as great\r\nAs is my grief, or lesser than my name,\r\nOr that I could forget what I have been,\r\nOr not remember what I must be now.\r\nSwell’st thou, proud heart? I’ll give thee scope to beat,\r\nSince foes have scope to beat both thee and me.\r\n\r\nAUMERLE.\r\nNorthumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nWhat must the King do now? Must he submit?\r\nThe King shall do it. Must he be deposed?\r\nThe King shall be contented. Must he lose\r\nThe name of King? I’ God’s name, let it go.\r\nI’ll give my jewels for a set of beads,\r\nMy gorgeous palace for a hermitage,\r\nMy gay apparel for an almsman’s gown,\r\nMy figured goblets for a dish of wood,\r\nMy sceptre for a palmer’s walking-staff,\r\nMy subjects for a pair of carved saints,\r\nAnd my large kingdom for a little grave,\r\nA little, little grave, an obscure grave;\r\nOr I’ll be buried in the King’s highway,\r\nSome way of common trade, where subjects’ feet\r\nMay hourly trample on their sovereign’s head;\r\nFor on my heart they tread now whilst I live,\r\nAnd, buried once, why not upon my head?\r\nAumerle, thou weep’st, my tender-hearted cousin!\r\nWe’ll make foul weather with despised tears;\r\nOur sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn\r\nAnd make a dearth in this revolting land.\r\nOr shall we play the wantons with our woes\r\nAnd make some pretty match with shedding tears?\r\nAs thus, to drop them still upon one place\r\nTill they have fretted us a pair of graves\r\nWithin the earth; and, therein laid, there lies\r\nTwo kinsmen digged their graves with weeping eyes.\r\nWould not this ill do well? Well, well, I see\r\nI talk but idly, and you laugh at me.\r\nMost mighty prince, my Lord Northumberland,\r\nWhat says King Bolingbroke? Will his Majesty\r\nGive Richard leave to live till Richard die?\r\nYou make a leg, and Bolingbroke says ay.\r\n\r\nNORTHUMBERLAND.\r\nMy lord, in the base court he doth attend\r\nTo speak with you. May it please you to come down?\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nDown, down I come, like glist’ring Phaëthon,\r\nWanting the manage of unruly jades.\r\nIn the base court? Base court, where kings grow base,\r\nTo come at traitors’ calls, and do them grace.\r\nIn the base court? Come down? Down, court! down, king!\r\nFor night-owls shriek where mounting larks should sing.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt from above._]\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nWhat says his Majesty?\r\n\r\nNORTHUMBERLAND.\r\nSorrow and grief of heart\r\nMakes him speak fondly like a frantic man.\r\nYet he is come.\r\n\r\n Enter King Richard and his attendants.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nStand all apart,\r\nAnd show fair duty to his Majesty. [_Kneeling_.]\r\nMy gracious lord.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nFair cousin, you debase your princely knee\r\nTo make the base earth proud with kissing it.\r\nMe rather had my heart might feel your love\r\nThan my unpleased eye see your courtesy.\r\nUp, cousin, up. Your heart is up, I know,\r\nThus high at least, although your knee be low.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nMy gracious lord, I come but for mine own.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nYour own is yours, and I am yours, and all.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nSo far be mine, my most redoubted lord,\r\nAs my true service shall deserve your love.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nWell you deserve. They well deserve to have\r\nThat know the strong’st and surest way to get.\r\nUncle, give me your hands. Nay, dry your eyes.\r\nTears show their love, but want their remedies.\r\nCousin, I am too young to be your father,\r\nThough you are old enough to be my heir.\r\nWhat you will have, I’ll give, and willing too;\r\nFor do we must what force will have us do.\r\nSet on towards London, cousin, is it so?\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nYea, my good lord.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nThen I must not say no.\r\n\r\n [_Flourish. Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV. Langley. The Duke of York’s garden.\r\n\r\n Enter the Queen and two Ladies.\r\n\r\nQUEEN.\r\nWhat sport shall we devise here in this garden\r\nTo drive away the heavy thought of care?\r\n\r\nLADY.\r\nMadam, we’ll play at bowls.\r\n\r\nQUEEN.\r\n’Twill make me think the world is full of rubs\r\nAnd that my fortune runs against the bias.\r\n\r\nLADY.\r\nMadam, we’ll dance.\r\n\r\nQUEEN.\r\nMy legs can keep no measure in delight\r\nWhen my poor heart no measure keeps in grief.\r\nTherefore no dancing, girl; some other sport.\r\n\r\nLADY.\r\nMadam, we’ll tell tales.\r\n\r\nQUEEN.\r\nOf sorrow or of joy?\r\n\r\nLADY.\r\nOf either, madam.\r\n\r\nQUEEN.\r\nOf neither, girl.\r\nFor if of joy, being altogether wanting,\r\nIt doth remember me the more of sorrow;\r\nOr if of grief, being altogether had,\r\nIt adds more sorrow to my want of joy.\r\nFor what I have I need not to repeat,\r\nAnd what I want it boots not to complain.\r\n\r\nLADY.\r\nMadam, I’ll sing.\r\n\r\nQUEEN.\r\n’Tis well that thou hast cause;\r\nBut thou shouldst please me better wouldst thou weep.\r\n\r\nLADY.\r\nI could weep, madam, would it do you good.\r\n\r\nQUEEN.\r\nAnd I could sing, would weeping do me good,\r\nAnd never borrow any tear of thee.\r\nBut stay, here come the gardeners.\r\nLet’s step into the shadow of these trees.\r\nMy wretchedness unto a row of pins,\r\nThey will talk of state, for everyone doth so\r\nAgainst a change; woe is forerun with woe.\r\n\r\n [_Queen and Ladies retire._]\r\n\r\n Enter a Gardener and two Servants.\r\n\r\nGARDENER.\r\nGo, bind thou up young dangling apricocks,\r\nWhich, like unruly children, make their sire\r\nStoop with oppression of their prodigal weight.\r\nGive some supportance to the bending twigs.\r\nGo thou, and like an executioner\r\nCut off the heads of too fast-growing sprays\r\nThat look too lofty in our commonwealth.\r\nAll must be even in our government.\r\nYou thus employed, I will go root away\r\nThe noisome weeds which without profit suck\r\nThe soil’s fertility from wholesome flowers.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nWhy should we in the compass of a pale\r\nKeep law and form and due proportion,\r\nShowing, as in a model, our firm estate,\r\nWhen our sea-walled garden, the whole land,\r\nIs full of weeds, her fairest flowers choked up,\r\nHer fruit trees all unpruned, her hedges ruined,\r\nHer knots disordered, and her wholesome herbs\r\nSwarming with caterpillars?\r\n\r\nGARDENER.\r\nHold thy peace.\r\nHe that hath suffered this disordered spring\r\nHath now himself met with the fall of leaf.\r\nThe weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter,\r\nThat seemed in eating him to hold him up,\r\nAre plucked up, root and all, by Bolingbroke—\r\nI mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nWhat, are they dead?\r\n\r\nGARDENER.\r\nThey are. And Bolingbroke\r\nHath seized the wasteful King. O, what pity is it\r\nThat he had not so trimmed and dressed his land\r\nAs we this garden! We at time of year\r\nDo wound the bark, the skin of our fruit trees,\r\nLest, being over-proud in sap and blood,\r\nWith too much riches it confound itself.\r\nHad he done so to great and growing men,\r\nThey might have lived to bear and he to taste\r\nTheir fruits of duty. Superfluous branches\r\nWe lop away, that bearing boughs may live.\r\nHad he done so, himself had home the crown,\r\nWhich waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nWhat, think you the King shall be deposed?\r\n\r\nGARDENER.\r\nDepressed he is already, and deposed\r\n’Tis doubt he will be. Letters came last night\r\nTo a dear friend of the good Duke of York’s\r\nThat tell black tidings.\r\n\r\nQUEEN.\r\nO, I am pressed to death through want of speaking!\r\n\r\n [_Coming forward._]\r\n\r\nThou, old Adam’s likeness, set to dress this garden,\r\nHow dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news?\r\nWhat Eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee\r\nTo make a second fall of cursed man?\r\nWhy dost thou say King Richard is deposed?\r\nDar’st thou, thou little better thing than earth,\r\nDivine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how,\r\nCam’st thou by this ill tidings? Speak, thou wretch!\r\n\r\nGARDENER.\r\nPardon me, madam. Little joy have I\r\nTo breathe this news; yet what I say is true.\r\nKing Richard, he is in the mighty hold\r\nOf Bolingbroke. Their fortunes both are weighed.\r\nIn your lord’s scale is nothing but himself,\r\nAnd some few vanities that make him light;\r\nBut in the balance of great Bolingbroke,\r\nBesides himself, are all the English peers,\r\nAnd with that odds he weighs King Richard down.\r\nPost you to London, and you will find it so.\r\nI speak no more than everyone doth know.\r\n\r\nQUEEN.\r\nNimble mischance, that art so light of foot,\r\nDoth not thy embassage belong to me,\r\nAnd am I last that knows it? O, thou thinkest\r\nTo serve me last that I may longest keep\r\nThy sorrow in my breast. Come, ladies, go\r\nTo meet at London London’s king in woe.\r\nWhat, was I born to this, that my sad look\r\nShould grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke?\r\nGard’ner, for telling me these news of woe,\r\nPray God the plants thou graft’st may never grow!\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Queen and Ladies._]\r\n\r\nGARDENER.\r\nPoor Queen, so that thy state might be no worse,\r\nI would my skill were subject to thy curse.\r\nHere did she fall a tear. Here in this place\r\nI’ll set a bank of rue, sour herb of grace.\r\nRue even for ruth here shortly shall be seen\r\nIn the remembrance of a weeping queen.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\nACT IV\r\n\r\nSCENE I. Westminster Hall.\r\n\n The Lords spiritual on the right side of the throne; the Lords\r\n temporal on the left; the Commons below. Enter Bolingbroke, Aumerle,\r\n Surrey, Northumberland, Harry Percy, Fitzwater, another Lord, the\r\n Bishop of Carlisle, the Abbot of Westminster and attendants.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nCall forth Bagot.\r\n\r\n Enter Officers with Bagot.\r\n\nNow, Bagot, freely speak thy mind,\r\nWhat thou dost know of noble Gloucester’s death,\r\nWho wrought it with the King, and who performed\r\nThe bloody office of his timeless end.\r\n\r\nBAGOT.\r\nThen set before my face the Lord Aumerle.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nCousin, stand forth, and look upon that man.\r\n\r\nBAGOT.\r\nMy Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue\r\nScorns to unsay what once it hath delivered.\r\nIn that dead time when Gloucester’s death was plotted,\r\nI heard you say “Is not my arm of length,\r\nThat reacheth from the restful English Court\r\nAs far as Calais, to mine uncle’s head?”\r\nAmongst much other talk that very time\r\nI heard you say that you had rather refuse\r\nThe offer of an hundred thousand crowns\r\nThan Bolingbroke’s return to England,\r\nAdding withal, how blest this land would be\r\nIn this your cousin’s death.\r\n\r\nAUMERLE.\r\nPrinces and noble lords,\r\nWhat answer shall I make to this base man?\r\nShall I so much dishonour my fair stars\r\nOn equal terms to give him chastisement?\r\nEither I must, or have mine honour soiled\r\nWith the attainder of his slanderous lips.\r\nThere is my gage, the manual seal of death\r\nThat marks thee out for hell. I say thou liest,\r\nAnd will maintain what thou hast said is false\r\nIn thy heart-blood, though being all too base\r\nTo stain the temper of my knightly sword.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nBagot, forbear. Thou shalt not take it up.\r\n\r\nAUMERLE.\r\nExcepting one, I would he were the best\r\nIn all this presence that hath moved me so.\r\n\r\nFITZWATER.\r\nIf that thy valour stand on sympathy,\r\nThere is my gage, Aumerle, in gage to thine.\r\nBy that fair sun which shows me where thou stand’st,\r\nI heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spak’st it,\r\nThat thou wert cause of noble Gloucester’s death.\r\nIf thou deniest it twenty times, thou liest!\r\nAnd I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart,\r\nWhere it was forged, with my rapier’s point.\r\n\r\nAUMERLE.\r\nThou dar’st not, coward, live to see that day.\r\n\r\nFITZWATER.\r\nNow, by my soul, I would it were this hour.\r\n\r\nAUMERLE.\r\nFitzwater, thou art damned to hell for this.\r\n\r\nHARRY PERCY.\r\nAumerle, thou liest. His honour is as true\r\nIn this appeal as thou art an unjust;\r\nAnd that thou art so, there I throw my gage,\r\nTo prove it on thee to the extremest point\r\nOf mortal breathing. Seize it if thou dar’st.\r\n\r\nAUMERLE.\r\nAnd if I do not, may my hands rot off\r\nAnd never brandish more revengeful steel\r\nOver the glittering helmet of my foe!\r\n\r\nANOTHER LORD.\r\nI task the earth to the like, forsworn Aumerle,\r\nAnd spur thee on with full as many lies\r\nAs may be holloaed in thy treacherous ear\r\nFrom sun to sun. There is my honour’s pawn.\r\nEngage it to the trial if thou dar’st.\r\n\r\nAUMERLE.\r\nWho sets me else? By heaven, I’ll throw at all.\r\nI have a thousand spirits in one breast\r\nTo answer twenty thousand such as you.\r\n\r\nSURREY.\r\nMy Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well\r\nThe very time Aumerle and you did talk.\r\n\r\nFITZWATER.\r\n’Tis very true. You were in presence then,\r\nAnd you can witness with me this is true.\r\n\r\nSURREY.\r\nAs false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true.\r\n\r\nFITZWATER.\r\nSurrey, thou liest.\r\n\r\nSURREY.\r\nDishonourable boy!\r\nThat lie shall lie so heavy on my sword\r\nThat it shall render vengeance and revenge\r\nTill thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie\r\nIn earth as quiet as thy father’s skull.\r\nIn proof whereof, there is my honour’s pawn.\r\nEngage it to the trial if thou dar’st.\r\n\r\nFITZWATER.\r\nHow fondly dost thou spur a forward horse!\r\nIf I dare eat, or drink, or breathe, or live,\r\nI dare meet Surrey in a wilderness\r\nAnd spit upon him, whilst I say he lies,\r\nAnd lies, and lies. There is my bond of faith\r\nTo tie thee to my strong correction.\r\nAs I intend to thrive in this new world,\r\nAumerle is guilty of my true appeal.\r\nBesides, I heard the banished Norfolk say\r\nThat thou, Aumerle, didst send two of thy men\r\nTo execute the noble duke at Calais.\r\n\r\nAUMERLE.\r\nSome honest Christian trust me with a gage.\r\nThat Norfolk lies, here do I throw down this,\r\nIf he may be repealed to try his honour.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nThese differences shall all rest under gage\r\nTill Norfolk be repealed. Repealed he shall be,\r\nAnd, though mine enemy, restored again\r\nTo all his lands and signories. When he is returned,\r\nAgainst Aumerle we will enforce his trial.\r\n\r\nCARLISLE.\r\nThat honourable day shall ne’er be seen.\r\nMany a time hath banished Norfolk fought\r\nFor Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field,\r\nStreaming the ensign of the Christian cross\r\nAgainst black pagans, Turks, and Saracens;\r\nAnd, toiled with works of war, retired himself\r\nTo Italy, and there at Venice gave\r\nHis body to that pleasant country’s earth\r\nAnd his pure soul unto his captain, Christ,\r\nUnder whose colours he had fought so long.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nWhy, Bishop, is Norfolk dead?\r\n\r\nCARLISLE.\r\nAs surely as I live, my lord.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nSweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom\r\nOf good old Abraham! Lords appellants,\r\nYour differences shall all rest under gage\r\nTill we assign you to your days of trial.\r\n\r\n Enter York, attended.\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nGreat Duke of Lancaster, I come to thee\r\nFrom plume-plucked Richard, who with willing soul\r\nAdopts thee heir, and his high sceptre yields\r\nTo the possession of thy royal hand.\r\nAscend his throne, descending now from him,\r\nAnd long live Henry, of that name the fourth!\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nIn God’s name, I’ll ascend the regal throne.\r\n\r\nCARLISLE.\r\nMarry, God forbid!\r\nWorst in this royal presence may I speak,\r\nYet best beseeming me to speak the truth.\r\nWould God that any in this noble presence\r\nWere enough noble to be upright judge\r\nOf noble Richard! Then true noblesse would\r\nLearn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.\r\nWhat subject can give sentence on his king?\r\nAnd who sits here that is not Richard’s subject?\r\nThieves are not judged but they are by to hear,\r\nAlthough apparent guilt be seen in them;\r\nAnd shall the figure of God’s majesty,\r\nHis captain, steward, deputy elect,\r\nAnointed, crowned, planted many years,\r\nBe judged by subject and inferior breath,\r\nAnd he himself not present? O, forfend it, God,\r\nThat in a Christian climate souls refined\r\nShould show so heinous, black, obscene a deed!\r\nI speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,\r\nStirred up by God, thus boldly for his king.\r\nMy Lord of Hereford here, whom you call king,\r\nIs a foul traitor to proud Hereford’s king.\r\nAnd if you crown him, let me prophesy\r\nThe blood of English shall manure the ground\r\nAnd future ages groan for this foul act.\r\nPeace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels,\r\nAnd in this seat of peace tumultuous wars\r\nShall kin with kin and kind with kind confound.\r\nDisorder, horror, fear, and mutiny\r\nShall here inhabit, and this land be called\r\nThe field of Golgotha and dead men’s skulls.\r\nO, if you raise this house against this house,\r\nIt will the woefullest division prove\r\nThat ever fell upon this cursed earth.\r\nPrevent it, resist it, let it not be so,\r\nLest child, child’s children, cry against you, “woe!”\r\n\r\nNORTHUMBERLAND.\r\nWell have you argued, sir; and, for your pains,\r\nOf capital treason we arrest you here.\r\nMy Lord of Westminster, be it your charge\r\nTo keep him safely till his day of trial.\r\nMay it please you, lords, to grant the commons’ suit?\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nFetch hither Richard, that in common view\r\nHe may surrender. So we shall proceed\r\nWithout suspicion.\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nI will be his conduct.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nLords, you that here are under our arrest,\r\nProcure your sureties for your days of answer.\r\nLittle are we beholding to your love,\r\nAnd little looked for at your helping hands.\r\n\r\n Enter York with King Richard and Officers bearing the Crown, &c.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nAlack, why am I sent for to a king\r\nBefore I have shook off the regal thoughts\r\nWherewith I reigned? I hardly yet have learned\r\nTo insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my knee.\r\nGive sorrow leave awhile to tutor me\r\nTo this submission. Yet I well remember\r\nThe favours of these men. Were they not mine?\r\nDid they not sometime cry “All hail!” to me?\r\nSo Judas did to Christ, but He in twelve,\r\nFound truth in all but one; I, in twelve thousand, none.\r\nGod save the King! Will no man say, “Amen”?\r\nAm I both priest and clerk? Well then, amen.\r\nGod save the King, although I be not he,\r\nAnd yet, Amen, if heaven do think him me.\r\nTo do what service am I sent for hither?\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nTo do that office of thine own good will\r\nWhich tired majesty did make thee offer:\r\nThe resignation of thy state and crown\r\nTo Henry Bolingbroke.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nGive me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown.\r\nHere, cousin,\r\nOn this side my hand, and on that side thine.\r\nNow is this golden crown like a deep well\r\nThat owes two buckets, filling one another,\r\nThe emptier ever dancing in the air,\r\nThe other down, unseen, and full of water.\r\nThat bucket down and full of tears am I,\r\nDrinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nI thought you had been willing to resign.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nMy crown I am, but still my griefs are mine.\r\nYou may my glories and my state depose,\r\nBut not my griefs; still am I king of those.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nPart of your cares you give me with your crown.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nYour cares set up do not pluck my cares down.\r\nMy care is loss of care, by old care done;\r\nYour care is gain of care, by new care won.\r\nThe cares I give I have, though given away;\r\nThey ’tend the crown, yet still with me they stay.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nAre you contented to resign the crown?\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nAy, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be.\r\nTherefore no “no”, for I resign to thee.\r\nNow mark me how I will undo myself:\r\nI give this heavy weight from off my head,\r\nAnd this unwieldy sceptre from my hand,\r\nThe pride of kingly sway from out my heart;\r\nWith mine own tears I wash away my balm,\r\nWith mine own hands I give away my crown,\r\nWith mine own tongue deny my sacred state,\r\nWith mine own breath release all duteous oaths.\r\nAll pomp and majesty I do forswear;\r\nMy manors, rents, revenues, I forgo;\r\nMy acts, decrees, and statutes, I deny.\r\nGod pardon all oaths that are broke to me;\r\nGod keep all vows unbroke are made to thee.\r\nMake me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved,\r\nAnd thou with all pleased that hast all achieved.\r\nLong mayst thou live in Richard’s seat to sit,\r\nAnd soon lie Richard in an earthly pit!\r\nGod save King Henry, unkinged Richard says,\r\nAnd send him many years of sunshine days!\r\nWhat more remains?\r\n\r\nNORTHUMBERLAND.\r\n[_Offering a paper_.] No more, but that you read\r\nThese accusations, and these grievous crimes\r\nCommitted by your person and your followers\r\nAgainst the state and profit of this land;\r\nThat, by confessing them, the souls of men\r\nMay deem that you are worthily deposed.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nMust I do so? And must I ravel out\r\nMy weaved-up follies? Gentle Northumberland,\r\nIf thy offences were upon record,\r\nWould it not shame thee in so fair a troop\r\nTo read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst,\r\nThere shouldst thou find one heinous article\r\nContaining the deposing of a king\r\nAnd cracking the strong warrant of an oath,\r\nMarked with a blot, damned in the book of heaven.\r\nNay, all of you that stand and look upon me\r\nWhilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself,\r\nThough some of you, with Pilate, wash your hands,\r\nShowing an outward pity, yet you Pilates\r\nHave here delivered me to my sour cross,\r\nAnd water cannot wash away your sin.\r\n\r\nNORTHUMBERLAND.\r\nMy lord, dispatch. Read o’er these articles.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nMine eyes are full of tears; I cannot see:\r\nAnd yet salt water blinds them not so much\r\nBut they can see a sort of traitors here.\r\nNay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself,\r\nI find myself a traitor with the rest;\r\nFor I have given here my soul’s consent\r\nT’ undeck the pompous body of a king,\r\nMade glory base and sovereignty a slave,\r\nProud majesty a subject, state a peasant.\r\n\r\nNORTHUMBERLAND.\r\nMy lord—\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nNo lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,\r\nNor no man’s lord! I have no name, no title,\r\nNo, not that name was given me at the font,\r\nBut ’tis usurped. Alack the heavy day!\r\nThat I have worn so many winters out\r\nAnd know not now what name to call myself.\r\nO, that I were a mockery king of snow,\r\nStanding before the sun of Bolingbroke,\r\nTo melt myself away in water-drops!\r\nGood king, great king, and yet not greatly good,\r\nAn if my word be sterling yet in England,\r\nLet it command a mirror hither straight,\r\nThat it may show me what a face I have,\r\nSince it is bankrupt of his majesty.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nGo, some of you, and fetch a looking-glass.\r\n\r\n [_Exit an Attendant._]\r\n\r\nNORTHUMBERLAND.\r\nRead o’er this paper while the glass doth come.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nFiend, thou torments me ere I come to hell!\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nUrge it no more, my Lord Northumberland.\r\n\r\nNORTHUMBERLAND.\r\nThe commons will not then be satisfied.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nThey shall be satisfied. I’ll read enough\r\nWhen I do see the very book indeed\r\nWhere all my sins are writ, and that’s myself.\r\n\r\n Re-enter Attendant with glass.\r\n\r\nGive me that glass, and therein will I read.\r\nNo deeper wrinkles yet? Hath sorrow struck\r\nSo many blows upon this face of mine\r\nAnd made no deeper wounds? O flatt’ring glass,\r\nLike to my followers in prosperity,\r\nThou dost beguile me. Was this face the face\r\nThat every day under his household roof\r\nDid keep ten thousand men? Was this the face\r\nThat like the sun did make beholders wink?\r\nIs this the face which faced so many follies,\r\nThat was at last outfaced by Bolingbroke?\r\nA brittle glory shineth in this face.\r\nAs brittle as the glory is the face!\r\n\r\n [_Dashes the glass against the ground._]\r\n\r\nFor there it is, cracked in an hundred shivers.\r\nMark, silent king, the moral of this sport,\r\nHow soon my sorrow hath destroyed my face.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nThe shadow of your sorrow hath destroyed\r\nThe shadow of your face.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nSay that again.\r\nThe shadow of my sorrow? Ha, let’s see.\r\n’Tis very true, my grief lies all within;\r\nAnd these external manner of laments\r\nAre merely shadows to the unseen grief\r\nThat swells with silence in the tortured soul.\r\nThere lies the substance. And I thank thee, king,\r\nFor thy great bounty, that not only giv’st\r\nMe cause to wail, but teachest me the way\r\nHow to lament the cause. I’ll beg one boon,\r\nAnd then be gone and trouble you no more.\r\nShall I obtain it?\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nName it, fair cousin.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\n“Fair cousin”? I am greater than a king;\r\nFor when I was a king, my flatterers\r\nWere then but subjects. Being now a subject,\r\nI have a king here to my flatterer.\r\nBeing so great, I have no need to beg.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nYet ask.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nAnd shall I have?\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nYou shall.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nThen give me leave to go.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nWhither?\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nWhither you will, so I were from your sights.\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE.\r\nGo, some of you, convey him to the Tower.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nO, good! “Convey”?

I will lay\r\nA plot shall show us all a merry day.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\nACT V\r\n\r\nSCENE I. London. A street leading to the Tower.\r\n\n Enter the Queen and ladies.\r\n\r\nQUEEN.\r\nThis way the King will come. This is the way\r\nTo Julius Caesar’s ill-erected tower,\r\nTo whose flint bosom my condemned lord\r\nIs doomed a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke.\r\nHere let us rest, if this rebellious earth\r\nHave any resting for her true king’s queen.\r\n\r\n Enter King Richard and Guard.\r\n\r\nBut soft, but see, or rather do not see\r\nMy fair rose wither; yet look up, behold,\r\nThat you in pity may dissolve to dew\r\nAnd wash him fresh again with true-love tears.\r\nAh, thou, the model where old Troy did stand,\r\nThou map of honour, thou King Richard’s tomb,\r\nAnd not King Richard! Thou most beauteous inn,\r\nWhy should hard-favoured grief be lodged in thee,\r\nWhen triumph is become an alehouse guest?\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nJoin not with grief, fair woman, do not so,\r\nTo make my end too sudden. Learn, good soul,\r\nTo think our former state a happy dream,\r\nFrom which awaked, the truth of what we are\r\nShows us but this. I am sworn brother, sweet,\r\nTo grim Necessity, and he and I\r\nWill keep a league till death. Hie thee to France,\r\nAnd cloister thee in some religious house.\r\nOur holy lives must win a new world’s crown,\r\nWhich our profane hours here have thrown down.\r\n\r\nQUEEN.\r\nWhat, is my Richard both in shape and mind\r\nTransformed and weakened! Hath Bolingbroke\r\nDeposed thine intellect? Hath he been in thy heart?\r\nThe lion dying thrusteth forth his paw\r\nAnd wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rage\r\nTo be o’erpowered; and wilt thou, pupil-like,\r\nTake the correction mildly, kiss the rod,\r\nAnd fawn on rage with base humility,\r\nWhich art a lion and the king of beasts?\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nA king of beasts, indeed! If aught but beasts,\r\nI had been still a happy king of men.\r\nGood sometimes queen, prepare thee hence for France.\r\nThink I am dead, and that even here thou tak’st,\r\nAs from my death-bed, thy last living leave.\r\nIn winter’s tedious nights sit by the fire\r\nWith good old folks, and let them tell thee tales\r\nOf woeful ages long ago betid;\r\nAnd ere thou bid good night, to quit their griefs,\r\nTell thou the lamentable tale of me,\r\nAnd send the hearers weeping to their beds.\r\nFor why, the senseless brands will sympathize\r\nThe heavy accent of thy moving tongue,\r\nAnd in compassion weep the fire out;\r\nAnd some will mourn in ashes, some coal-black,\r\nFor the deposing of a rightful king.\r\n\r\n Enter Northumberland, attended.\r\n\r\nNORTHUMBERLAND.\r\nMy lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is changed.\r\nYou must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower.\r\nAnd, madam, there is order ta’en for you:\r\nWith all swift speed you must away to France.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nNorthumberland, thou ladder wherewithal\r\nThe mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne,\r\nThe time shall not be many hours of age\r\nMore than it is ere foul sin, gathering head,\r\nShall break into corruption. Thou shalt think,\r\nThough he divide the realm and give thee half\r\nIt is too little, helping him to all.\r\nAnd he shall think that thou, which knowst the way\r\nTo plant unrightful kings, wilt know again,\r\nBeing ne’er so little urged, another way\r\nTo pluck him headlong from the usurped throne.\r\nThe love of wicked men converts to fear,\r\nThat fear to hate, and hate turns one or both\r\nTo worthy danger and deserved death.\r\n\r\nNORTHUMBERLAND.\r\nMy guilt be on my head, and there an end.\r\nTake leave and part, for you must part forthwith.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nDoubly divorced! Bad men, you violate\r\nA twofold marriage, ’twixt my crown and me,\r\nAnd then betwixt me and my married wife.\r\nLet me unkiss the oath ’twixt thee and me;\r\nAnd yet not so, for with a kiss ’twas made.\r\nPart us, Northumberland: I towards the north,\r\nWhere shivering cold and sickness pines the clime;\r\nMy wife to France, from whence set forth in pomp,\r\nShe came adorned hither like sweet May,\r\nSent back like Hallowmas or short’st of day.\r\n\r\nQUEEN.\r\nAnd must we be divided? Must we part?\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nAy, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart.\r\n\r\nQUEEN.\r\nBanish us both, and send the King with me.\r\n\r\nNORTHUMBERLAND.\r\nThat were some love, but little policy.\r\n\r\nQUEEN.\r\nThen whither he goes, thither let me go.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nSo two, together weeping, make one woe.\r\nWeep thou for me in France, I for thee here;\r\nBetter far off than near, be ne’er the near.\r\nGo, count thy way with sighs, I mine with groans.\r\n\r\nQUEEN.\r\nSo longest way shall have the longest moans.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nTwice for one step I’ll groan, the way being short,\r\nAnd piece the way out with a heavy heart.\r\nCome, come, in wooing sorrow let’s be brief,\r\nSince, wedding it, there is such length in grief.\r\nOne kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part;\r\nThus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart.\r\n\r\n [_They kiss._]\r\n\r\nQUEEN.\r\nGive me mine own again; ’twere no good part\r\nTo take on me to keep and kill thy heart.\r\n\r\n [_They kiss again._]\r\n\r\nSo, now I have mine own again, be gone,\r\nThat I may strive to kill it with a groan.\r\n\r\nKING RICHARD.\r\nWe make woe wanton with this fond delay:\r\nOnce more, adieu. The rest let sorrow say.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. The same. A room in the Duke of York’s palace.\r\n\r\n Enter York and his Duchess.\r\n\r\nDUCHESS.\r\nMy Lord, you told me you would tell the rest,\r\nWhen weeping made you break the story off\r\nOf our two cousins’ coming into London.\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nWhere did I leave?\r\n\r\nDUCHESS.\r\nAt that sad stop, my lord,\r\nWhere rude misgoverned hands from windows’ tops\r\nThrew dust and rubbish on King Richard’s head.\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nThen, as I said, the Duke, great Bolingbroke,\r\nMounted upon a hot and fiery steed,\r\nWhich his aspiring rider seemed to know,\r\nWith slow but stately pace kept on his course,\r\nWhilst all tongues cried “God save thee, Bolingbroke!”\r\nYou would have thought the very windows spake,\r\nSo many greedy looks of young and old\r\nThrough casements darted their desiring eyes\r\nUpon his visage, and that all the walls\r\nWith painted imagery had said at once\r\n“Jesu preserve thee! Welcome, Bolingbroke!”\r\nWhilst he, from the one side to the other turning,\r\nBareheaded, lower than his proud steed’s neck,\r\nBespake them thus, “I thank you, countrymen.”\r\nAnd thus still doing, thus he passed along.\r\n\r\nDUCHESS.\r\nAlack, poor Richard! Where rode he the whilst?\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nAs in a theatre the eyes of men\r\nAfter a well-graced actor leaves the stage,\r\nAre idly bent on him that enters next,\r\nThinking his prattle to be tedious,\r\nEven so, or with much more contempt, men’s eyes\r\nDid scowl on gentle Richard. No man cried “God save him!”\r\nNo joyful tongue gave him his welcome home,\r\nBut dust was thrown upon his sacred head,\r\nWhich with such gentle sorrow he shook off,\r\nHis face still combating with tears and smiles,\r\nThe badges of his grief and patience,\r\nThat had not God for some strong purpose, steeled\r\nThe hearts of men, they must perforce have melted,\r\nAnd barbarism itself have pitied him.\r\nBut heaven hath a hand in these events,\r\nTo whose high will we bound our calm contents.\r\nTo Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,\r\nWhose state and honour I for aye allow.\r\n\r\n Enter Aumerle.\r\n\r\nDUCHESS.\r\nHere comes my son Aumerle.\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nAumerle that was;\r\nBut that is lost for being Richard’s friend,\r\nAnd, madam, you must call him Rutland now.\r\nI am in Parliament pledge for his truth\r\nAnd lasting fealty to the new-made king.\r\n\r\nDUCHESS.\r\nWelcome, my son. Who are the violets now\r\nThat strew the green lap of the new-come spring?\r\n\r\nAUMERLE.\r\nMadam, I know not, nor I greatly care not.\r\nGod knows I had as lief be none as one.\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nWell, bear you well in this new spring of time,\r\nLest you be cropped before you come to prime.\r\nWhat news from Oxford? Do these jousts and triumphs hold?\r\n\r\nAUMERLE.\r\nFor aught I know, my lord, they do.\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nYou will be there, I know.\r\n\r\nAUMERLE.\r\nIf God prevent not, I purpose so.\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nWhat seal is that that hangs without thy bosom?\r\nYea, look’st thou pale? Let me see the writing.\r\n\r\nAUMERLE.\r\nMy lord, ’tis nothing.\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nNo matter, then, who see it.\r\nI will be satisfied. Let me see the writing.\r\n\r\nAUMERLE.\r\nI do beseech your Grace to pardon me.\r\nIt is a matter of small consequence,\r\nWhich for some reasons I would not have seen.\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nWhich for some reasons, sir, I mean to see.\r\nI fear, I fear—\r\n\r\nDUCHESS.\r\nWhat should you fear?\r\n’Tis nothing but some bond that he is entered into\r\nFor gay apparel ’gainst the triumph day.\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nBound to himself? What doth he with a bond\r\nThat he is bound to? Wife, thou art a fool.\r\nBoy, let me see the writing.\r\n\r\nAUMERLE.\r\nI do beseech you, pardon me. I may not show it.\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nI will be satisfied. Let me see it, I say.\r\n\r\n [_Snatches it and reads it._]\r\n\r\nTreason, foul treason!

I will unto the King.\r\n\r\n Re-enter Servant with boots.\r\n\r\nDUCHESS.\r\nStrike him, Aumerle! Poor boy, thou art amazed.\r\n[_To Servant_.]\r\nHence, villain! Never more come in my sight.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Servant._]\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nGive me my boots, I say.\r\n\r\nDUCHESS.\r\nWhy, York, what wilt thou do?\r\nWilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own?\r\nHave we more sons? Or are we like to have?\r\nIs not my teeming date drunk up with time?\r\nAnd wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age\r\nAnd rob me of a happy mother’s name?\r\nIs he not like thee? Is he not thine own?\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nThou fond mad woman,\r\nWilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy?\r\nA dozen of them here have ta’en the sacrament\r\nAnd interchangeably set down their hands\r\nTo kill the King at Oxford.\r\n\r\nDUCHESS.\r\nHe shall be none;\r\nWe’ll keep him here. Then what is that to him?\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nAway, fond woman! Were he twenty times my son,\r\nI would appeach him.\r\n\r\nDUCHESS.\r\nHadst thou groaned for him\r\nAs I have done, thou wouldst be more pitiful.\r\nBut now I know thy mind: thou dost suspect\r\nThat I have been disloyal to thy bed\r\nAnd that he is a bastard, not thy son.\r\nSweet York, sweet husband, be not of that mind.\r\nHe is as like thee as a man may be,\r\nNot like to me, or any of my kin,\r\nAnd yet I love him.\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nMake way, unruly woman!\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nDUCHESS.\r\nAfter, Aumerle! Mount thee upon his horse!\r\nSpur post, and get before him to the King,\r\nAnd beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee.\r\nI’ll not be long behind. Though I be old,\r\nI doubt not but to ride as fast as York.\r\nAnd never will I rise up from the ground\r\nTill Bolingbroke have pardoned thee. Away, be gone!\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III.

Yet through both\r\nI see some sparks of better hope, which elder years\r\nMay happily bring forth. But who comes here?\r\n\r\n Enter Aumerle.\r\n\r\nAUMERLE.\r\nWhere is the King?\r\n\r\nKING HENRY.\r\nWhat means our cousin that he stares and looks so wildly?\r\n\r\nAUMERLE.\r\nGod save your Grace!

Come, let’s go.\r\nI am the King’s friend, and will rid his foe.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE V. Pomfret. The dungeon of the Castle.\r\n\r\n Enter Richard.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nI have been studying how I may compare\r\nThis prison where I live unto the world;\r\nAnd for because the world is populous\r\nAnd here is not a creature but myself,\r\nI cannot do it. Yet I’ll hammer it out.\r\nMy brain I’ll prove the female to my soul,\r\nMy soul the father, and these two beget\r\nA generation of still-breeding thoughts,\r\nAnd these same thoughts people this little world,\r\nIn humours like the people of this world,\r\nFor no thought is contented. The better sort,\r\nAs thoughts of things divine, are intermixed\r\nWith scruples, and do set the word itself\r\nAgainst the word, as thus: “Come, little ones”;\r\nAnd then again:\r\n“It is as hard to come as for a camel\r\nTo thread the postern of a needle’s eye.”\r\nThoughts tending to ambition, they do plot\r\nUnlikely wonders: how these vain weak nails\r\nMay tear a passage through the flinty ribs\r\nOf this hard world, my ragged prison walls,\r\nAnd, for they cannot, die in their own pride.\r\nThoughts tending to content flatter themselves\r\nThat they are not the first of fortune’s slaves,\r\nNor shall not be the last, like silly beggars\r\nWho sitting in the stocks refuge their shame\r\nThat many have and others must sit there;\r\nAnd in this thought they find a kind of ease,\r\nBearing their own misfortunes on the back\r\nOf such as have before endured the like.\r\nThus play I in one person many people,\r\nAnd none contented. Sometimes am I king;\r\nThen treasons make me wish myself a beggar,\r\nAnd so I am. Then crushing penury\r\nPersuades me I was better when a king;\r\nThen am I kinged again, and by and by\r\nThink that I am unkinged by Bolingbroke,\r\nAnd straight am nothing. But whate’er I be,\r\nNor I nor any man that but man is\r\nWith nothing shall be pleased till he be eased\r\nWith being nothing.\r\nMusic do I hear? [_Music_.]\r\nHa, ha! keep time! How sour sweet music is\r\nWhen time is broke and no proportion kept!\r\nSo is it in the music of men’s lives.\r\nAnd here have I the daintiness of ear\r\nTo check time broke in a disordered string;\r\nBut for the concord of my state and time\r\nHad not an ear to hear my true time broke.\r\nI wasted time, and now doth time waste me;\r\nFor now hath time made me his numb’ring clock.\r\nMy thoughts are minutes, and with sighs they jar\r\nTheir watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,\r\nWhereto my finger, like a dial’s point,\r\nIs pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.\r\nNow, sir, the sound that tells what hour it is\r\nAre clamorous groans which strike upon my heart,\r\nWhich is the bell. So sighs and tears and groans\r\nShow minutes, times, and hours. But my time\r\nRuns posting on in Bolingbroke’s proud joy,\r\nWhile I stand fooling here, his Jack o’ the clock.\r\nThis music mads me! Let it sound no more;\r\nFor though it have holp madmen to their wits,\r\nIn me it seems it will make wise men mad.\r\nYet blessing on his heart that gives it me,\r\nFor ’tis a sign of love; and love to Richard\r\nIs a strange brooch in this all-hating world.\r\n\r\n Enter a Groom of the stable.\r\n\r\nGROOM.\r\nHail, royal Prince!\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nThanks, noble peer.\r\nThe cheapest of us is ten groats too dear.\r\nWhat art thou, and how comest thou hither\r\nWhere no man never comes but that sad dog\r\nThat brings me food to make misfortune live?\r\n\r\nGROOM.\r\nI was a poor groom of thy stable, king,\r\nWhen thou wert king; who, travelling towards York,\r\nWith much ado at length have gotten leave\r\nTo look upon my sometimes royal master’s face.\r\nO, how it erned my heart when I beheld\r\nIn London streets, that coronation day,\r\nWhen Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary,\r\nThat horse that thou so often hast bestrid,\r\nThat horse that I so carefully have dressed.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nRode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend,\r\nHow went he under him?\r\n\r\nGROOM.\r\nSo proudly as if he disdained the ground.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nSo proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!\r\nThat jade hath eat bread from my royal hand;\r\nThis hand hath made him proud with clapping him.\r\nWould he not stumble? Would he not fall down,\r\nSince pride must have a fall, and break the neck\r\nOf that proud man that did usurp his back?\r\nForgiveness, horse! Why do I rail on thee,\r\nSince thou, created to be awed by man,\r\nWast born to bear? I was not made a horse,\r\nAnd yet I bear a burden like an ass,\r\nSpurred, galled and tired by jauncing Bolingbroke.\r\n\r\n Enter Keeper with a dish.\r\n\r\nKEEPER. [_To the Groom_.]\r\nFellow, give place. Here is no longer stay.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nIf thou love me, ’tis time thou wert away.\r\n\r\nGROOM.\r\nMy tongue dares not, that my heart shall say.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nKEEPER.\r\nMy lord, will’t please you to fall to?\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nTaste of it first as thou art wont to do.\r\n\r\nKEEPER.\r\nMy lord, I dare not. Sir Pierce of Exton,\r\nWho lately came from the King, commands the contrary.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nThe devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee!\r\nPatience is stale, and I am weary of it.\r\n\r\n [_Strikes the Keeper._]\r\n\r\nKEEPER.\r\nHelp, help, help!\r\n\r\n Enter Exton and Servants, armed.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nHow now! What means death in this rude assault?\r\nVillain, thy own hand yields thy death’s instrument.\r\n\r\n [_Snatching a weapon and killing one._]\r\n\r\nGo thou and fill another room in hell.\r\n\r\n [_He kills another, then Exton strikes him down._]\r\n\r\nThat hand shall burn in never-quenching fire\r\nThat staggers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce hand\r\nHath with the King’s blood stained the King’s own land.\r\nMount, mount, my soul! Thy seat is up on high,\r\nWhilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die.\r\n\r\n [_Dies._]\r\n\r\nEXTON.\r\nAs full of valour as of royal blood!\r\nBoth have I spilled. O, would the deed were good!\r\nFor now the devil that told me I did well\r\nSays that this deed is chronicled in hell.\r\nThis dead king to the living king I’ll bear.\r\nTake hence the rest, and give them burial here.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE VI.

What is the news?\r\n\r\nNORTHUMBERLAND.\r\nFirst, to thy sacred state wish I all happiness.\r\nThe next news is: I have to London sent\r\nThe heads of Salisbury, Spencer, Blunt, and Kent.\r\nThe manner of their taking may appear\r\nAt large discoursed in this paper here.\r\n\r\nKING HENRY.\r\nWe thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains,\r\nAnd to thy worth will add right worthy gains.\r\n\r\n Enter Fitzwater.\r\n\r\nFITZWATER.\r\nMy lord, I have from Oxford sent to London\r\nThe heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely,\r\nTwo of the dangerous consorted traitors\r\nThat sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow.\r\n\r\nKING HENRY.\r\nThy pains, Fitzwater, shall not be forgot.\r\nRight noble is thy merit, well I wot.\r\n\r\n Enter Harry Percy with the Bishop of Carlisle.\r\n\r\nPERCY.\r\nThe grand conspirator, Abbot of Westminster,\r\nWith clog of conscience and sour melancholy,\r\nHath yielded up his body to the grave.\r\nBut here is Carlisle living, to abide\r\nThy kingly doom and sentence of his pride.\r\n\r\nKING HENRY.\r\nCarlisle, this is your doom:\r\nChoose out some secret place, some reverend room,\r\nMore than thou hast, and with it joy thy life.\r\nSo as thou liv’st in peace, die free from strife;\r\nFor though mine enemy thou hast ever been,\r\nHigh sparks of honour in thee have I seen.\r\n\r\n Enter Exton with attendants, bearing a coffin.\r\n\r\nEXTON.\r\nGreat king, within this coffin I present\r\nThy buried fear. Herein all breathless lies\r\nThe mightiest of thy greatest enemies,\r\nRichard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.\r\n\r\nKING HENRY.\r\nExton, I thank thee not, for thou hast wrought\r\nA deed of slander with thy fatal hand\r\nUpon my head and all this famous land.\r\n\r\nEXTON.\r\nFrom your own mouth, my lord, did I this deed.\r\n\r\nKING HENRY.\r\nThey love not poison that do poison need,\r\nNor do I thee. Though I did wish him dead,\r\nI hate the murderer, love him murdered.\r\nThe guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour,\r\nBut neither my good word nor princely favour.\r\nWith Cain go wander thorough shades of night,\r\nAnd never show thy head by day nor light.\r\nLords, I protest my soul is full of woe\r\nThat blood should sprinkle me to make me grow.\r\nCome, mourn with me for what I do lament,\r\nAnd put on sullen black incontinent.\r\nI’ll make a voyage to the Holy Land\r\nTo wash this blood off from my guilty hand.\r\nMarch sadly after; grace my mournings here\r\nIn weeping after this untimely bier.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\nKING RICHARD THE THIRD\r\n\nContents\r\n\r\n ACT I\r\n Scene I.

London. A street\r\n\nEnter Richard, Duke of Gloucester, alone.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nNow is the winter of our discontent\r\nMade glorious summer by this son of York;\r\nAnd all the clouds that loured upon our house\r\nIn the deep bosom of the ocean buried.\r\nNow are our brows bound with victorious wreaths,\r\nOur bruised arms hung up for monuments,\r\nOur stern alarums changed to merry meetings,\r\nOur dreadful marches to delightful measures.\r\nGrim-visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front;\r\nAnd now, instead of mounting barbed steeds\r\nTo fright the souls of fearful adversaries,\r\nHe capers nimbly in a lady’s chamber\r\nTo the lascivious pleasing of a lute.\r\nBut I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,\r\nNor made to court an amorous looking-glass;\r\nI, that am rudely stamped, and want love’s majesty\r\nTo strut before a wanton ambling nymph;\r\nI, that am curtailed of this fair proportion,\r\nCheated of feature by dissembling nature,\r\nDeformed, unfinished, sent before my time\r\nInto this breathing world scarce half made up,\r\nAnd that so lamely and unfashionable\r\nThat dogs bark at me as I halt by them—\r\nWhy, I, in this weak piping time of peace,\r\nHave no delight to pass away the time,\r\nUnless to spy my shadow in the sun,\r\nAnd descant on mine own deformity.\r\nAnd therefore, since I cannot prove a lover\r\nTo entertain these fair well-spoken days,\r\nI am determined to prove a villain,\r\nAnd hate the idle pleasures of these days.\r\nPlots have I laid, inductions dangerous,\r\nBy drunken prophecies, libels, and dreams,\r\nTo set my brother Clarence and the King\r\nIn deadly hate the one against the other;\r\nAnd if King Edward be as true and just\r\nAs I am subtle, false, and treacherous,\r\nThis day should Clarence closely be mewed up\r\nAbout a prophecy which says that “G”\r\nOf Edward’s heirs the murderer shall be.\r\nDive, thoughts, down to my soul. Here Clarence comes.\r\n\r\nEnter Clarence, guarded and Brakenbury.\r\n\r\nBrother, good day. What means this armed guard\r\nThat waits upon your Grace?\r\n\r\nCLARENCE.\r\nHis Majesty,\r\nTend’ring my person’s safety, hath appointed\r\nThis conduct to convey me to the Tower.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nUpon what cause?\r\n\r\nCLARENCE.\r\nBecause my name is George.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nAlack, my lord, that fault is none of yours.\r\nHe should, for that, commit your godfathers.\r\nO, belike his Majesty hath some intent\r\nThat you should be new-christened in the Tower.\r\nBut what’s the matter, Clarence? May I know?\r\n\r\nCLARENCE.\r\nYea, Richard, when I know, for I protest\r\nAs yet I do not. But, as I can learn,\r\nHe hearkens after prophecies and dreams,\r\nAnd from the cross-row plucks the letter G,\r\nAnd says a wizard told him that by “G”\r\nHis issue disinherited should be.\r\nAnd for my name of George begins with G,\r\nIt follows in his thought that I am he.\r\nThese, as I learn, and such like toys as these,\r\nHath moved his Highness to commit me now.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nWhy, this it is when men are ruled by women.\r\n’Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower;\r\nMy Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, ’tis she\r\nThat tempers him to this extremity.\r\nWas it not she and that good man of worship,\r\nAntony Woodville, her brother there,\r\nThat made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,\r\nFrom whence this present day he is delivered?\r\nWe are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.\r\n\r\nCLARENCE.\r\nBy heaven, I think there is no man secure\r\nBut the Queen’s kindred, and night-walking heralds\r\nThat trudge betwixt the King and Mistress Shore.\r\nHeard you not what an humble suppliant\r\nLord Hastings was to her for his delivery?\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nHumbly complaining to her deity\r\nGot my Lord Chamberlain his liberty.\r\nI’ll tell you what: I think it is our way,\r\nIf we will keep in favour with the King,\r\nTo be her men and wear her livery.\r\nThe jealous o’er-worn widow and herself,\r\nSince that our brother dubbed them gentlewomen,\r\nAre mighty gossips in our monarchy.\r\n\r\nBRAKENBURY.\r\nI beseech your Graces both to pardon me.\r\nHis Majesty hath straitly given in charge\r\nThat no man shall have private conference,\r\nOf what degree soever, with your brother.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nEven so; an please your worship, Brakenbury,\r\nYou may partake of anything we say.\r\nWe speak no treason, man. We say the King\r\nIs wise and virtuous, and his noble Queen\r\nWell struck in years, fair, and not jealous.\r\nWe say that Shore’s wife hath a pretty foot,\r\nA cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;\r\nAnd that the Queen’s kindred are made gentlefolks.\r\nHow say you, sir? Can you deny all this?\r\n\r\nBRAKENBURY.\r\nWith this, my lord, myself have naught to do.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nNaught to do with Mistress Shore? I tell thee, fellow,\r\nHe that doth naught with her, excepting one,\r\nWere best to do it secretly alone.\r\n\r\nBRAKENBURY.\r\nWhat one, my lord?\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nHer husband, knave! Wouldst thou betray me?\r\n\r\nBRAKENBURY.\r\nI do beseech your Grace to pardon me, and withal\r\nForbear your conference with the noble Duke.\r\n\r\nCLARENCE.\r\nWe know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nWe are the Queen’s abjects and must obey.\r\nBrother, farewell. I will unto the King,\r\nAnd whatsoe’er you will employ me in,\r\nWere it to call King Edward’s widow “sister,”\r\nI will perform it to enfranchise you.\r\nMeantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood\r\nTouches me deeper than you can imagine.\r\n\r\nCLARENCE.\r\nI know it pleaseth neither of us well.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nWell, your imprisonment shall not be long.\r\nI will deliver or else lie for you.\r\nMeantime, have patience.\r\n\r\nCLARENCE.\r\nI must perforce. Farewell.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Clarence, Brakenbury and guard._]\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nGo tread the path that thou shalt ne’er return.\r\nSimple, plain Clarence, I do love thee so\r\nThat I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,\r\nIf heaven will take the present at our hands.\r\nBut who comes here? The new-delivered Hastings?\r\n\r\nEnter Lord Hastings.\r\n\r\nHASTINGS.\r\nGood time of day unto my gracious lord.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nAs much unto my good Lord Chamberlain.\r\nWell are you welcome to the open air.\r\nHow hath your lordship brooked imprisonment?\r\n\r\nHASTINGS.\r\nWith patience, noble lord, as prisoners must;\r\nBut I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks\r\nThat were the cause of my imprisonment.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nNo doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too,\r\nFor they that were your enemies are his,\r\nAnd have prevailed as much on him as you.\r\n\r\nHASTINGS.\r\nMore pity that the eagles should be mewed,\r\nWhiles kites and buzzards prey at liberty.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nWhat news abroad?\r\n\r\nHASTINGS.\r\nNo news so bad abroad as this at home:\r\nThe King is sickly, weak, and melancholy,\r\nAnd his physicians fear him mightily.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nNow, by Saint John, that news is bad indeed.\r\nO, he hath kept an evil diet long,\r\nAnd overmuch consumed his royal person.\r\n’Tis very grievous to be thought upon.\r\nWhere is he, in his bed?\r\n\r\nHASTINGS.\r\nHe is.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nGo you before, and I will follow you.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Hastings._]\r\n\r\nHe cannot live, I hope, and must not die\r\nTill George be packed with post-horse up to heaven.\r\nI’ll in to urge his hatred more to Clarence\r\nWith lies well steeled with weighty arguments;\r\nAnd, if I fail not in my deep intent,\r\nClarence hath not another day to live;\r\nWhich done, God take King Edward to his mercy,\r\nAnd leave the world for me to bustle in.\r\nFor then I’ll marry Warwick’s youngest daughter.\r\nWhat though I killed her husband and her father?\r\nThe readiest way to make the wench amends\r\nIs to become her husband and her father;\r\nThe which will I, not all so much for love\r\nAs for another secret close intent,\r\nBy marrying her which I must reach unto.\r\nBut yet I run before my horse to market.\r\nClarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns.\r\nWhen they are gone, then must I count my gains.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II.

Marry with a king,\r\nA bachelor, and a handsome stripling too.\r\nIwis your grandam had a worser match.\r\n\r\nQUEEN ELIZABETH.\r\nMy lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne\r\nYour blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs.\r\nBy heaven, I will acquaint his Majesty\r\nOf those gross taunts that oft I have endured.\r\nI had rather be a country servant-maid\r\nThan a great queen with this condition,\r\nTo be so baited, scorned, and stormed at.\r\n\r\nEnter old Queen Margaret behind.\r\n\r\nSmall joy have I in being England’s queen.\r\n\r\nQUEEN MARGARET.\r\n[_Aside._] And lessened be that small, God, I beseech Him!\r\nThy honour, state, and seat, is due to me.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nWhat, threat you me with telling of the King?\r\nTell him, and spare not. Look what I have said\r\nI will avouch ’t in presence of the King;\r\nI dare adventure to be sent to th’ Tower.\r\n’Tis time to speak. My pains are quite forgot.\r\n\r\nQUEEN MARGARET.\r\n[_Aside._] Out, devil! I do remember them too well:\r\nThou killed’st my husband Henry in the Tower,\r\nAnd Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nEre you were queen, ay, or your husband king,\r\nI was a pack-horse in his great affairs;\r\nA weeder-out of his proud adversaries,\r\nA liberal rewarder of his friends.\r\nTo royalize his blood, I spilt mine own.\r\n\r\nQUEEN MARGARET.\r\n[_Aside._] Ay, and much better blood than his or thine.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nIn all which time, you and your husband Grey\r\nWere factious for the house of Lancaster.\r\nAnd, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband\r\nIn Margaret’s battle at Saint Albans slain?\r\nLet me put in your minds, if you forget,\r\nWhat you have been ere this, and what you are;\r\nWithal, what I have been, and what I am.\r\n\r\nQUEEN MARGARET.\r\n[_Aside._] A murd’rous villain, and so still thou art.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nPoor Clarence did forsake his father Warwick,\r\nAy, and forswore himself—which Jesu pardon!—\r\n\r\nQUEEN MARGARET.\r\n[_Aside._] Which God revenge!\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nTo fight on Edward’s party for the crown;\r\nAnd for his meed, poor lord, he is mewed up.\r\nI would to God my heart were flint, like Edward’s,\r\nOr Edward’s soft and pitiful, like mine.\r\nI am too childish-foolish for this world.\r\n\r\nQUEEN MARGARET.\r\n[_Aside._] Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave this world,\r\nThou cacodemon! There thy kingdom is.\r\n\r\nRIVERS.\r\nMy lord of Gloucester, in those busy days\r\nWhich here you urge to prove us enemies,\r\nWe followed then our lord, our sovereign king.\r\nSo should we you, if you should be our king.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nIf I should be! I had rather be a pedler.\r\nFar be it from my heart, the thought thereof.\r\n\r\nQUEEN ELIZABETH.\r\nAs little joy, my lord, as you suppose\r\nYou should enjoy, were you this country’s king,\r\nAs little joy you may suppose in me\r\nThat I enjoy, being the Queen thereof.\r\n\r\nQUEEN MARGARET.\r\n[_Aside._] As little joy enjoys the Queen thereof,\r\nFor I am she, and altogether joyless.\r\nI can no longer hold me patient.\r\n\r\n[_Coming forward._]\r\n\r\nHear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out\r\nIn sharing that which you have pilled from me!\r\nWhich of you trembles not that looks on me?\r\nIf not, that I am Queen, you bow like subjects,\r\nYet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels.\r\nAh, gentle villain, do not turn away.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nFoul wrinkled witch, what mak’st thou in my sight?\r\n\r\nQUEEN MARGARET.\r\nBut repetition of what thou hast marred.\r\nThat will I make before I let thee go.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nWert thou not banished on pain of death?\r\n\r\nQUEEN MARGARET.\r\nI was, but I do find more pain in banishment\r\nThan death can yield me here by my abode.\r\nA husband and a son thou ow’st to me;\r\nAnd thou a kingdom; all of you, allegiance.\r\nThis sorrow that I have by right is yours;\r\nAnd all the pleasures you usurp are mine.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nThe curse my noble father laid on thee\r\nWhen thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper,\r\nAnd with thy scorns drew’st rivers from his eyes,\r\nAnd then to dry them, gav’st the Duke a clout\r\nSteeped in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland—\r\nHis curses then, from bitterness of soul\r\nDenounced against thee, are all fall’n upon thee,\r\nAnd God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.\r\n\r\nQUEEN ELIZABETH.\r\nSo just is God, to right the innocent.\r\n\r\nHASTINGS.\r\nO, ’twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,\r\nAnd the most merciless that e’er was heard of.\r\n\r\nRIVERS.\r\nTyrants themselves wept when it was reported.\r\n\r\nDORSET.\r\nNo man but prophesied revenge for it.\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM.\r\nNorthumberland, then present, wept to see it.\r\n\r\nQUEEN MARGARET.\r\nWhat, were you snarling all before I came,\r\nReady to catch each other by the throat,\r\nAnd turn you all your hatred now on me?\r\nDid York’s dread curse prevail so much with heaven\r\nThat Henry’s death, my lovely Edward’s death,\r\nTheir kingdom’s loss, my woeful banishment,\r\nShould all but answer for that peevish brat?\r\nCan curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?\r\nWhy then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!\r\nThough not by war, by surfeit die your King,\r\nAs ours by murder, to make him a king.\r\nEdward thy son, that now is Prince of Wales,\r\nFor Edward our son, that was Prince of Wales,\r\nDie in his youth by like untimely violence.\r\nThyself a queen, for me that was a queen,\r\nOutlive thy glory, like my wretched self.\r\nLong mayst thou live to wail thy children’s death,\r\nAnd see another, as I see thee now,\r\nDecked in thy rights, as thou art stalled in mine;\r\nLong die thy happy days before thy death,\r\nAnd, after many lengthened hours of grief,\r\nDie neither mother, wife, nor England’s Queen.\r\nRivers and Dorset, you were standers-by,\r\nAnd so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son\r\nWas stabbed with bloody daggers.

Lords, will you go with me?\r\n\r\nRIVERS.\r\nWe wait upon your Grace.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt all but Richard._]\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nI do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.\r\nThe secret mischiefs that I set abroach\r\nI lay unto the grievous charge of others.\r\nClarence, whom I indeed have cast in darkness,\r\nI do beweep to many simple gulls,\r\nNamely, to Derby, Hastings, Buckingham;\r\nAnd tell them ’tis the Queen and her allies\r\nThat stir the King against the Duke my brother.\r\nNow they believe it, and withal whet me\r\nTo be revenged on Rivers, Dorset, Grey.\r\nBut then I sigh, and, with a piece of Scripture,\r\nTell them that God bids us do good for evil;\r\nAnd thus I clothe my naked villany\r\nWith odd old ends stol’n forth of Holy Writ,\r\nAnd seem a saint when most I play the devil.\r\n\r\nEnter two Murderers.\r\n\r\nBut soft, here come my executioners.\r\nHow now, my hardy, stout, resolved mates;\r\nAre you now going to dispatch this thing?\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nWe are, my lord, and come to have the warrant,\r\nThat we may be admitted where he is.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nWell thought upon; I have it here about me.\r\n\r\n[_Gives the warrant._]\r\n\r\nWhen you have done, repair to Crosby Place.\r\nBut, sirs, be sudden in the execution,\r\nWithal obdurate, do not hear him plead;\r\nFor Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps\r\nMay move your hearts to pity, if you mark him.\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\nTut, tut, my lord, we will not stand to prate.\r\nTalkers are no good doers. Be assured\r\nWe go to use our hands, and not our tongues.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nYour eyes drop millstones when fools’ eyes fall tears.\r\nI like you, lads.

A Room in the Tower\r\n\r\nEnter Clarence and Keeper.\r\n\r\nKEEPER.\r\nWhy looks your Grace so heavily today?\r\n\r\nCLARENCE.\r\nO, I have passed a miserable night,\r\nSo full of fearful dreams, of ugly sights,\r\nThat, as I am a Christian faithful man,\r\nI would not spend another such a night\r\nThough ’twere to buy a world of happy days,\r\nSo full of dismal terror was the time!\r\n\r\nKEEPER.\r\nWhat was your dream, my lord? I pray you tell me.\r\n\r\nCLARENCE.\r\nMethoughts that I had broken from the Tower,\r\nAnd was embarked to cross to Burgundy;\r\nAnd in my company my brother Gloucester,\r\nWho from my cabin tempted me to walk\r\nUpon the hatches. Thence we looked toward England,\r\nAnd cited up a thousand heavy times,\r\nDuring the wars of York and Lancaster,\r\nThat had befall’n us. As we paced along\r\nUpon the giddy footing of the hatches,\r\nMethought that Gloucester stumbled, and in falling,\r\nStruck me, that thought to stay him, overboard\r\nInto the tumbling billows of the main.\r\nO Lord, methought what pain it was to drown,\r\nWhat dreadful noise of waters in my ears;\r\nWhat sights of ugly death within my eyes.\r\nMethoughts I saw a thousand fearful wracks;\r\nA thousand men that fishes gnawed upon;\r\nWedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,\r\nInestimable stones, unvalued jewels,\r\nAll scattered in the bottom of the sea.\r\nSome lay in dead men’s skulls, and in the holes\r\nWhere eyes did once inhabit there were crept—\r\nAs ’twere in scorn of eyes—reflecting gems,\r\nThat wooed the slimy bottom of the deep,\r\nAnd mocked the dead bones that lay scattered by.\r\n\r\nKEEPER.\r\nHad you such leisure in the time of death\r\nTo gaze upon these secrets of the deep?\r\n\r\nCLARENCE.\r\nMethought I had; and often did I strive\r\nTo yield the ghost, but still the envious flood\r\nStopped in my soul, and would not let it forth\r\nTo find the empty, vast, and wand’ring air,\r\nBut smothered it within my panting bulk,\r\nWho almost burst to belch it in the sea.\r\n\r\nKEEPER.\r\nAwaked you not in this sore agony?\r\n\r\nCLARENCE.\r\nNo, no, my dream was lengthened after life.\r\nO, then began the tempest to my soul.\r\nI passed, methought, the melancholy flood,\r\nWith that sour ferryman which poets write of,\r\nUnto the kingdom of perpetual night.\r\nThe first that there did greet my stranger-soul\r\nWas my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick,\r\nWho spake aloud, “What scourge for perjury\r\nCan this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?”\r\nAnd so he vanished. Then came wand’ring by\r\nA shadow like an angel, with bright hair\r\nDabbled in blood; and he shrieked out aloud\r\n“Clarence is come—false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,\r\nThat stabbed me in the field by Tewksbury!\r\nSeize on him, Furies! Take him unto torment!”\r\nWith that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends\r\nEnvironed me, and howled in mine ears\r\nSuch hideous cries that with the very noise\r\nI trembling waked, and for a season after\r\nCould not believe but that I was in hell,\r\nSuch terrible impression made my dream.\r\n\r\nKEEPER.\r\nNo marvel, lord, though it affrighted you;\r\nI am afraid, methinks, to hear you tell it.\r\n\r\nCLARENCE.\r\nAh, Keeper, Keeper, I have done these things,\r\nThat now give evidence against my soul,\r\nFor Edward’s sake, and see how he requites me.\r\nO God, if my deep prayers cannot appease Thee,\r\nBut Thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,\r\nYet execute Thy wrath in me alone;\r\nO, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!\r\nKeeper, I prithee sit by me awhile.\r\nMy soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.\r\n\r\nKEEPER.\r\nI will, my lord; God give your Grace good rest.\r\n\r\n[_Clarence reposes himself on a chair._]\r\n\r\nEnter Brakenbury the Lieutenant.\r\n\r\nBRAKENBURY.\r\nSorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,\r\nMakes the night morning, and the noontide night.\r\nPrinces have but their titles for their glories,\r\nAn outward honour for an inward toil;\r\nAnd, for unfelt imaginations,\r\nThey often feel a world of restless cares,\r\nSo that between their titles and low name,\r\nThere’s nothing differs but the outward fame.\r\n\r\nEnter the two Murderers.\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nHo, who’s here?\r\n\r\nBRAKENBURY.\r\nWhat wouldst thou, fellow? And how cam’st thou hither?\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\nI would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.\r\n\r\nBRAKENBURY.\r\nWhat, so brief?\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\n’Tis better, sir, than to be tedious. Let him see our commission, and\r\ntalk no more.\r\n\r\n[_Brakenbury reads the commission._]\r\n\r\nBRAKENBURY.\r\nI am in this commanded to deliver\r\nThe noble Duke of Clarence to your hands.\r\nI will not reason what is meant hereby,\r\nBecause I will be guiltless of the meaning.\r\nThere lies the Duke asleep, and there the keys.\r\nI’ll to the King and signify to him\r\nThat thus I have resigned to you my charge.\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nYou may, sir; ’tis a point of wisdom. Fare you well.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Brakenbury and the Keeper._]\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\nWhat, shall I stab him as he sleeps?\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nNo. He’ll say ’twas done cowardly, when he wakes.\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\nWhy, he shall never wake until the great Judgement Day.\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nWhy, then he’ll say we stabbed him sleeping.\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\nThe urging of that word “judgement” hath bred a kind of remorse in me.\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nWhat, art thou afraid?\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\nNot to kill him, having a warrant, but to be damned for killing him,\r\nfrom the which no warrant can defend me.\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nI thought thou hadst been resolute.\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\nSo I am—to let him live.\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nI’ll back to the Duke of Gloucester and tell him so.\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\nNay, I prithee stay a little. I hope this passionate humour will\r\nchange. It was wont to hold me but while one tells twenty.\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nHow dost thou feel thyself now?\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\nFaith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me.\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nRemember our reward, when the deed’s done.\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\nZounds, he dies! I had forgot the reward.\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nWhere’s thy conscience now?\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\nO, in the Duke of Gloucester’s purse.\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nSo, when he opens his purse to give us our reward, thy conscience flies\r\nout.\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\n’Tis no matter; let it go. There’s few or none will entertain it.\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nWhat if it come to thee again?\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\nI’ll not meddle with it; it makes a man coward. A man cannot steal but\r\nit accuseth him; a man cannot swear but it checks him; a man cannot lie\r\nwith his neighbour’s wife but it detects him. ’Tis a blushing\r\nshamefaced spirit that mutinies in a man’s bosom. It fills a man full\r\nof obstacles. It made me once restore a purse of gold that by chance I\r\nfound. It beggars any man that keeps it. It is turned out of towns and\r\ncities for a dangerous thing; and every man that means to live well\r\nendeavours to trust to himself and live without it.\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nZounds, ’tis even now at my elbow, persuading me not to kill the Duke.\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\nTake the devil in thy mind, and believe him not. He would insinuate\r\nwith thee but to make thee sigh.\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nI am strong-framed; he cannot prevail with me.\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\nSpoke like a tall man that respects thy reputation. Come, shall we fall\r\nto work?\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nTake him on the costard with the hilts of thy sword, and then throw him\r\nin the malmsey-butt in the next room.\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\nO excellent device—and make a sop of him.\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nSoft, he wakes.\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\nStrike!\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nNo, we’ll reason with him.\r\n\r\nCLARENCE.\r\nWhere art thou, keeper? Give me a cup of wine.\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\nYou shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.\r\n\r\nCLARENCE.\r\nIn God’s name, what art thou?\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nA man, as you are.\r\n\r\nCLARENCE.\r\nBut not as I am, royal.\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\nNor you as we are, loyal.\r\n\r\nCLARENCE.\r\nThy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nMy voice is now the King’s, my looks mine own.\r\n\r\nCLARENCE.\r\nHow darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!\r\nYour eyes do menace me; why look you pale?\r\nWho sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\nTo, to, to—\r\n\r\nCLARENCE.\r\nTo murder me?\r\n\r\nBOTH MURDERERS.\r\nAy, ay.\r\n\r\nCLARENCE.\r\nYou scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,\r\nAnd therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.\r\nWherein, my friends, have I offended you?\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nOffended us you have not, but the King.\r\n\r\nCLARENCE.\r\nI shall be reconciled to him again.\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\nNever, my lord; therefore prepare to die.\r\n\r\nCLARENCE.\r\nAre you drawn forth among a world of men\r\nTo slay the innocent? What is my offence?\r\nWhere is the evidence that doth accuse me?\r\nWhat lawful quest have given their verdict up\r\nUnto the frowning judge? Or who pronounced\r\nThe bitter sentence of poor Clarence’ death?\r\nBefore I be convict by course of law,\r\nTo threaten me with death is most unlawful.\r\nI charge you, as you hope to have redemption,\r\nBy Christ’s dear blood shed for our grievous sins,\r\nThat you depart, and lay no hands on me.\r\nThe deed you undertake is damnable.\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nWhat we will do, we do upon command.\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\nAnd he that hath commanded is our King.\r\n\r\nCLARENCE.\r\nErroneous vassals! The great King of kings\r\nHath in the table of his law commanded\r\nThat thou shalt do no murder. Will you then\r\nSpurn at His edict and fulfil a man’s?\r\nTake heed, for He holds vengeance in His hand\r\nTo hurl upon their heads that break His law.\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\nAnd that same vengeance doth He hurl on thee\r\nFor false forswearing, and for murder too.\r\nThou didst receive the sacrament to fight\r\nIn quarrel of the house of Lancaster.\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nAnd like a traitor to the name of God\r\nDidst break that vow, and with thy treacherous blade\r\nUnrippedst the bowels of thy sovereign’s son.\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\nWhom thou wast sworn to cherish and defend.\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nHow canst thou urge God’s dreadful law to us,\r\nWhen thou hast broke it in such dear degree?\r\n\r\nCLARENCE.\r\nAlas, for whose sake did I that ill deed?\r\nFor Edward, for my brother, for his sake.\r\nHe sends you not to murder me for this,\r\nFor in that sin he is as deep as I.\r\nIf God will be avenged for the deed,\r\nO, know you yet He doth it publicly;\r\nTake not the quarrel from His powerful arm;\r\nHe needs no indirect or lawless course\r\nTo cut off those that have offended Him.\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nWho made thee then a bloody minister\r\nWhen gallant-springing, brave Plantagenet,\r\nThat princely novice, was struck dead by thee?\r\n\r\nCLARENCE.\r\nMy brother’s love, the devil, and my rage.\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nThy brother’s love, our duty, and thy faults,\r\nProvoke us hither now to slaughter thee.\r\n\r\nCLARENCE.\r\nIf you do love my brother, hate not me.\r\nI am his brother, and I love him well.\r\nIf you are hired for meed, go back again,\r\nAnd I will send you to my brother Gloucester,\r\nWho shall reward you better for my life\r\nThan Edward will for tidings of my death.\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\nYou are deceived. Your brother Gloucester hates you.\r\n\r\nCLARENCE.\r\nO no, he loves me, and he holds me dear.\r\nGo you to him from me.\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nAy, so we will.\r\n\r\nCLARENCE.\r\nTell him when that our princely father York\r\nBlessed his three sons with his victorious arm,\r\nAnd charged us from his soul to love each other,\r\nHe little thought of this divided friendship.\r\nBid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nAy, millstones, as he lessoned us to weep.\r\n\r\nCLARENCE.\r\nO, do not slander him, for he is kind.\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nRight, as snow in harvest. Come, you deceive yourself.\r\n’Tis he that sends us to destroy you here.\r\n\r\nCLARENCE.\r\nIt cannot be, for he bewept my fortune,\r\nAnd hugged me in his arms, and swore with sobs\r\nThat he would labour my delivery.\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nWhy, so he doth, when he delivers you\r\nFrom this earth’s thraldom to the joys of heaven.\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\nMake peace with God, for you must die, my lord.\r\n\r\nCLARENCE.\r\nHave you that holy feeling in your souls\r\nTo counsel me to make my peace with God,\r\nAnd are you yet to your own souls so blind\r\nThat you will war with God by murd’ring me?\r\nO sirs, consider: they that set you on\r\nTo do this deed will hate you for the deed.\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\nWhat shall we do?\r\n\r\nCLARENCE.\r\nRelent, and save your souls.\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nRelent? No, ’tis cowardly and womanish.\r\n\r\nCLARENCE.\r\nNot to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.\r\nWhich of you—if you were a prince’s son,\r\nBeing pent from liberty, as I am now—\r\nIf two such murderers as yourselves came to you,\r\nWould not entreat for life? Ay, you would beg,\r\nWere you in my distress.\r\nMy friend, I spy some pity in thy looks.\r\nO, if thine eye be not a flatterer,\r\nCome thou on my side, and entreat for me;\r\nA begging prince what beggar pities not?\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\nLook behind you, my lord.\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nTake that, and that! [_Stabs him._] If all this will not do,\r\nI’ll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.\r\n\r\n[_Exit with the body._]\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\nA bloody deed, and desperately dispatched.\r\nHow fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands\r\nOf this most grievous murder.\r\n\r\nEnter First Murderer.\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nHow now? What mean’st thou that thou help’st me not?\r\nBy heavens, the Duke shall know how slack you have been.\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER.\r\nI would he knew that I had saved his brother.\r\nTake thou the fee, and tell him what I say,\r\nFor I repent me that the Duke is slain.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER.\r\nSo do not I. Go, coward as thou art.\r\nWell, I’ll go hide the body in some hole\r\nTill that the Duke give order for his burial.\r\nAnd when I have my meed, I will away,\r\nFor this will out, and then I must not stay.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\nACT II\r\n\r\nSCENE I.

Who, in my wrath,\r\nKneeled at my feet, and bid me be advised?\r\nWho spoke of brotherhood? Who spoke of love?\r\nWho told me how the poor soul did forsake\r\nThe mighty Warwick, and did fight for me?\r\nWho told me, in the field at Tewksbury,\r\nWhen Oxford had me down, he rescued me,\r\nAnd said, “Dear brother, live, and be a king”?\r\nWho told me, when we both lay in the field\r\nFrozen almost to death, how he did lap me\r\nEven in his garments, and did give himself,\r\nAll thin and naked, to the numb-cold night?\r\nAll this from my remembrance brutish wrath\r\nSinfully plucked, and not a man of you\r\nHad so much grace to put it in my mind.\r\nBut when your carters or your waiting vassals\r\nHave done a drunken slaughter, and defaced\r\nThe precious image of our dear Redeemer,\r\nYou straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon,\r\nAnd I, unjustly too, must grant it you.\r\nBut for my brother not a man would speak,\r\nNor I, ungracious, speak unto myself\r\nFor him, poor soul.

Another Room in the palace\r\n\r\nEnter the old Duchess of York with the two Children of Clarence.\r\n\r\nBOY.\r\nGood grandam, tell us, is our father dead?\r\n\r\nDUCHESS.\r\nNo, boy.\r\n\r\nGIRL.\r\nWhy do you weep so oft, and beat your breast,\r\nAnd cry “O Clarence, my unhappy son”?\r\n\r\nBOY.\r\nWhy do you look on us, and shake your head,\r\nAnd call us orphans, wretches, castaways,\r\nIf that our noble father were alive?\r\n\r\nDUCHESS.\r\nMy pretty cousins, you mistake me both.\r\nI do lament the sickness of the King,\r\nAs loath to lose him, not your father’s death.\r\nIt were lost sorrow to wail one that’s lost.\r\n\r\nBOY.\r\nThen you conclude, my grandam, he is dead.\r\nThe King mine uncle is to blame for it.\r\nGod will revenge it, whom I will importune\r\nWith earnest prayers all to that effect.\r\n\r\nGIRL.\r\nAnd so will I.\r\n\r\nDUCHESS.\r\nPeace, children, peace. The King doth love you well.\r\nIncapable and shallow innocents,\r\nYou cannot guess who caused your father’s death.\r\n\r\nBOY.\r\nGrandam, we can, for my good uncle Gloucester\r\nTold me, the King, provoked to it by the Queen,\r\nDevised impeachments to imprison him;\r\nAnd when my uncle told me so, he wept,\r\nAnd pitied me, and kindly kissed my cheek;\r\nBade me rely on him as on my father,\r\nAnd he would love me dearly as his child.\r\n\r\nDUCHESS.\r\nAh, that deceit should steal such gentle shape,\r\nAnd with a virtuous visard hide deep vice!\r\nHe is my son, ay, and therein my shame;\r\nYet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.\r\n\r\nBOY.\r\nThink you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?\r\n\r\nDUCHESS.\r\nAy, boy.\r\n\r\nBOY.\r\nI cannot think it. Hark, what noise is this?\r\n\r\nEnter Queen Elizabeth with her hair about her ears, Rivers and Dorset\r\nafter her.\r\n\r\nQUEEN ELIZABETH.\r\nAh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,\r\nTo chide my fortune, and torment myself?\r\nI’ll join with black despair against my soul\r\nAnd to myself become an enemy.\r\n\r\nDUCHESS.\r\nWhat means this scene of rude impatience?\r\n\r\nQUEEN ELIZABETH.\r\nTo make an act of tragic violence.\r\nEdward, my lord, thy son, our King, is dead.\r\nWhy grow the branches when the root is gone?\r\nWhy wither not the leaves that want their sap?\r\nIf you will live, lament; if die, be brief,\r\nThat our swift-winged souls may catch the King’s\r\nOr, like obedient subjects, follow him\r\nTo his new kingdom of ne’er-changing night.\r\n\r\nDUCHESS.\r\nAh, so much interest have I in thy sorrow\r\nAs I had title in thy noble husband.\r\nI have bewept a worthy husband’s death,\r\nAnd lived by looking on his images;\r\nBut now two mirrors of his princely semblance\r\nAre cracked in pieces by malignant death,\r\nAnd I, for comfort, have but one false glass,\r\nThat grieves me when I see my shame in him.\r\nThou art a widow, yet thou art a mother,\r\nAnd hast the comfort of thy children left;\r\nBut death hath snatched my husband from mine arms\r\nAnd plucked two crutches from my feeble hands,\r\nClarence and Edward. O, what cause have I,\r\nThine being but a moiety of my moan,\r\nTo overgo thy woes and drown thy cries.\r\n\r\nBOY.\r\nAh, aunt, you wept not for our father’s death.\r\nHow can we aid you with our kindred tears?\r\n\r\nGIRL.\r\nOur fatherless distress was left unmoaned.\r\nYour widow-dolour likewise be unwept!\r\n\r\nQUEEN ELIZABETH.\r\nGive me no help in lamentation.\r\nI am not barren to bring forth complaints.\r\nAll springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,\r\nThat I, being governed by the watery moon,\r\nMay send forth plenteous tears to drown the world.\r\nAh, for my husband, for my dear Lord Edward!\r\n\r\nCHILDREN.\r\nAh for our father, for our dear Lord Clarence!\r\n\r\nDUCHESS.\r\nAlas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!\r\n\r\nQUEEN ELIZABETH.\r\nWhat stay had I but Edward? And he’s gone.\r\n\r\nCHILDREN.\r\nWhat stay had we but Clarence? And he’s gone.\r\n\r\nDUCHESS.\r\nWhat stays had I but they? And they are gone.\r\n\r\nQUEEN ELIZABETH.\r\nWas never widow had so dear a loss.\r\n\r\nCHILDREN.\r\nWere never orphans had so dear a loss.\r\n\r\nDUCHESS.\r\nWas never mother had so dear a loss.\r\nAlas, I am the mother of these griefs.\r\nTheir woes are parcelled, mine is general.\r\nShe for an Edward weeps, and so do I;\r\nI for a Clarence weep, so doth not she;\r\nThese babes for Clarence weep, and so do I;\r\nI for an Edward weep, so do not they.\r\nAlas, you three, on me, threefold distressed,\r\nPour all your tears. I am your sorrow’s nurse,\r\nAnd I will pamper it with lamentation.\r\n\r\nDORSET.\r\nComfort, dear mother. God is much displeased\r\nThat you take with unthankfulness His doing.\r\nIn common worldly things ’tis called ungrateful\r\nWith dull unwillingness to repay a debt\r\nWhich with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;\r\nMuch more to be thus opposite with heaven,\r\nFor it requires the royal debt it lent you.\r\n\r\nRIVERS.\r\nMadam, bethink you, like a careful mother,\r\nOf the young prince your son. Send straight for him;\r\nLet him be crowned; in him your comfort lives.\r\nDrown desperate sorrow in dead Edward’s grave,\r\nAnd plant your joys in living Edward’s throne.\r\n\r\nEnter Richard, Buckingham, Stanley Earl of Derby, Hastings and\r\nRatcliffe.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nSister, have comfort.

It is good to grow.\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nGrandam, one night as we did sit at supper,\r\nMy uncle Rivers talked how I did grow\r\nMore than my brother. “Ay,” quoth my uncle Gloucester,\r\n“Small herbs have grace; great weeds do grow apace.”\r\nAnd since, methinks I would not grow so fast,\r\nBecause sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.\r\n\r\nDUCHESS.\r\nGood faith, good faith, the saying did not hold\r\nIn him that did object the same to thee!\r\nHe was the wretched’st thing when he was young,\r\nSo long a-growing and so leisurely,\r\nThat if his rule were true, he should be gracious.\r\n\r\nARCHBISHOP.\r\nAnd so no doubt he is, my gracious madam.\r\n\r\nDUCHESS.\r\nI hope he is, but yet let mothers doubt.\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nNow, by my troth, if I had been remembered,\r\nI could have given my uncle’s Grace a flout\r\nTo touch his growth nearer than he touched mine.\r\n\r\nDUCHESS.\r\nHow, my young York?

Lord cardinal, will your Grace\r\nPersuade the Queen to send the Duke of York\r\nUnto his princely brother presently?\r\nIf she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,\r\nAnd from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.\r\n\r\nCARDINAL.\r\nMy Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory\r\nCan from his mother win the Duke of York,\r\nAnon expect him here; but if she be obdurate\r\nTo mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid\r\nWe should infringe the holy privilege\r\nOf blessed sanctuary! Not for all this land\r\nWould I be guilty of so deep a sin.\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM.\r\nYou are too senseless-obstinate, my lord,\r\nToo ceremonious and traditional.\r\nWeigh it but with the grossness of this age,\r\nYou break not sanctuary in seizing him.\r\nThe benefit thereof is always granted\r\nTo those whose dealings have deserved the place\r\nAnd those who have the wit to claim the place.\r\nThis prince hath neither claimed it nor deserved it\r\nAnd therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it.\r\nThen taking him from thence that is not there,\r\nYou break no privilege nor charter there.\r\nOft have I heard of sanctuary-men,\r\nBut sanctuary children, never till now.\r\n\r\nCARDINAL.\r\nMy lord, you shall o’errule my mind for once.\r\nCome on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?\r\n\r\nHASTINGS.\r\nI go, my lord.\r\n\r\nPRINCE.\r\nGood lords, make all the speedy haste you may.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Cardinal and Hastings._]\r\n\r\nSay, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,\r\nWhere shall we sojourn till our coronation?\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nWhere it seems best unto your royal self.\r\nIf I may counsel you, some day or two\r\nYour Highness shall repose you at the Tower,\r\nThen where you please and shall be thought most fit\r\nFor your best health and recreation.\r\n\r\nPRINCE.\r\nI do not like the Tower, of any place.\r\nDid Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM.\r\nHe did, my gracious lord, begin that place,\r\nWhich, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.\r\n\r\nPRINCE.\r\nIs it upon record, or else reported\r\nSuccessively from age to age, he built it?\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM.\r\nUpon record, my gracious lord.\r\n\r\nPRINCE.\r\nBut say, my lord, it were not registered,\r\nMethinks the truth should live from age to age,\r\nAs ’twere retailed to all posterity,\r\nEven to the general all-ending day.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\n[_Aside_.] So wise so young, they say, do never live long.\r\n\r\nPRINCE.\r\nWhat say you, uncle?\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nI say, without characters, fame lives long.\r\n[_Aside_.] Thus, like the formal Vice, Iniquity,\r\nI moralize two meanings in one word.\r\n\r\nPRINCE.\r\nThat Julius Caesar was a famous man.\r\nWith what his valour did enrich his wit,\r\nHis wit set down to make his valour live;\r\nDeath makes no conquest of this conqueror,\r\nFor now he lives in fame, though not in life.\r\nI’ll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham.\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM.\r\nWhat, my gracious lord?\r\n\r\nPRINCE.\r\nAn if I live until I be a man,\r\nI’ll win our ancient right in France again,\r\nOr die a soldier, as I lived a king.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\n[_Aside_.] Short summers lightly have a forward spring.\r\n\r\nEnter young Duke of York, Hastings and the Cardinal.\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM.\r\nNow, in good time here comes the Duke of York.\r\n\r\nPRINCE.\r\nRichard of York, how fares our loving brother?\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nWell, my dread lord—so must I call you now.\r\n\r\nPRINCE.\r\nAy brother, to our grief, as it is yours.\r\nToo late he died that might have kept that title,\r\nWhich by his death hath lost much majesty.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nHow fares our cousin, noble lord of York?\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nI thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,\r\nYou said that idle weeds are fast in growth.\r\nThe Prince my brother hath outgrown me far.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nHe hath, my lord.\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nAnd therefore is he idle?\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nO, my fair cousin, I must not say so.\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nThen he is more beholding to you than I.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nHe may command me as my sovereign,\r\nBut you have power in me as in a kinsman.\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nI pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nMy dagger, little cousin?

O, that’s the sword to it.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nAy, gentle cousin, were it light enough.\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nO, then I see you will part but with light gifts;\r\nIn weightier things you’ll say a beggar nay.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nIt is too heavy for your Grace to wear.\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nI weigh it lightly, were it heavier.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nWhat, would you have my weapon, little lord?\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nI would, that I might thank you as you call me.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nHow?\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nLittle.\r\n\r\nPRINCE.\r\nMy lord of York will still be cross in talk.\r\nUncle, your Grace knows how to bear with him.\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nYou mean, to bear me, not to bear with me.\r\nUncle, my brother mocks both you and me.\r\nBecause that I am little, like an ape,\r\nHe thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM.\r\nWith what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!\r\nTo mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,\r\nHe prettily and aptly taunts himself.\r\nSo cunning and so young is wonderful.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nMy lord, wil’t please you pass along?\r\nMyself and my good cousin Buckingham\r\nWill to your mother, to entreat of her\r\nTo meet you at the Tower and welcome you.\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nWhat, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?\r\n\r\nPRINCE.\r\nMy Lord Protector needs will have it so.\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nI shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nWhy, what should you fear?\r\n\r\nYORK.\r\nMarry, my uncle Clarence’ angry ghost.\r\nMy grandam told me he was murdered there.\r\n\r\nPRINCE.\r\nI fear no uncles dead.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nNor none that live, I hope.\r\n\r\nPRINCE.\r\nAn if they live, I hope I need not fear.\r\nBut come, my lord.

O, ’tis a parlous boy,\r\nBold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable.\r\nHe is all the mother’s, from the top to toe.\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM.\r\nWell, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.\r\nThou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend\r\nAs closely to conceal what we impart.\r\nThou know’st our reasons urged upon the way.\r\nWhat think’st thou? Is it not an easy matter\r\nTo make William Lord Hastings of our mind\r\nFor the instalment of this noble Duke\r\nIn the seat royal of this famous isle?\r\n\r\nCATESBY.\r\nHe for his father’s sake so loves the Prince\r\nThat he will not be won to aught against him.\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM.\r\nWhat think’st thou then of Stanley?

He deserved his death,\r\nAnd your good Graces both have well proceeded,\r\nTo warn false traitors from the like attempts.\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM.\r\nI never looked for better at his hands\r\nAfter he once fell in with Mistress Shore.\r\nYet had we not determined he should die\r\nUntil your lordship came to see his end\r\nWhich now the loving haste of these our friends,\r\nSomething against our meanings, have prevented,\r\nBecause, my lord, we would have had you heard\r\nThe traitor speak, and timorously confess\r\nThe manner and the purpose of his treasons,\r\nThat you might well have signified the same\r\nUnto the citizens, who haply may\r\nMisconster us in him, and wail his death.\r\n\r\nMAYOR.\r\nBut, my good lord, your Grace’s word shall serve\r\nAs well as I had seen and heard him speak;\r\nAnd do not doubt, right noble princes both,\r\nBut I’ll acquaint our duteous citizens\r\nWith all your just proceedings in this case.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nAnd to that end we wished your lordship here,\r\nT’ avoid the censures of the carping world.\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM.\r\nBut since you come too late of our intent,\r\nYet witness what you hear we did intend.\r\nAnd so, my good Lord Mayor, we bid farewell.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Lord Mayor._]\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nGo, after, after, cousin Buckingham.\r\nThe Mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post.\r\nThere, at your meet’st advantage of the time,\r\nInfer the bastardy of Edward’s children;\r\nTell them how Edward put to death a citizen\r\nOnly for saying he would make his son\r\nHeir to the Crown—meaning indeed his house,\r\nWhich, by the sign thereof, was termed so.\r\nMoreover, urge his hateful luxury\r\nAnd bestial appetite in change of lust,\r\nWhich stretched unto their servants, daughters, wives,\r\nEven where his raging eye or savage heart,\r\nWithout control, lusted to make a prey.\r\nNay, for a need, thus far come near my person:\r\nTell them, when that my mother went with child\r\nOf that insatiate Edward, noble York\r\nMy princely father then had wars in France,\r\nAnd, by true computation of the time,\r\nFound that the issue was not his begot;\r\nWhich well appeared in his lineaments,\r\nBeing nothing like the noble Duke, my father.\r\nYet touch this sparingly, as ’twere far off;\r\nBecause, my lord, you know my mother lives.\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM.\r\nDoubt not, my lord, I’ll play the orator\r\nAs if the golden fee for which I plead\r\nWere for myself. And so, my lord, adieu.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nIf you thrive well, bring them to Baynard’s Castle,\r\nWhere you shall find me well accompanied\r\nWith reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM.\r\nI go; and towards three or four o’clock\r\nLook for the news that the Guildhall affords.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nGo, Lovell, with all speed to Doctor Shaa.\r\n[_To Ratcliffe_.] Go thou to Friar Penker; bid them both\r\nMeet me within this hour at Baynard’s Castle.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Ratcliffe and Lovell._]\r\n\r\nNow will I go to take some privy order\r\nTo draw the brats of Clarence out of sight,\r\nAnd to give order that no manner person\r\nHave any time recourse unto the Princes.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE VI.

Who is so gross\r\nThat cannot see this palpable device?\r\nYet who so bold but says he sees it not?\r\nBad is the world, and all will come to naught\r\nWhen such ill dealing must be seen in thought.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE VII.

What say the citizens?\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM.\r\nNow, by the holy mother of our Lord,\r\nThe citizens are mum, say not a word.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nTouched you the bastardy of Edward’s children?\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM.\r\nI did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,\r\nAnd his contract by deputy in France;\r\nTh’ insatiate greediness of his desire,\r\nAnd his enforcement of the city wives;\r\nHis tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,\r\nAs being got, your father then in France,\r\nAnd his resemblance, being not like the Duke.\r\nWithal, I did infer your lineaments,\r\nBeing the right idea of your father,\r\nBoth in your form and nobleness of mind;\r\nLaid open all your victories in Scotland,\r\nYour discipline in war, wisdom in peace,\r\nYour bounty, virtue, fair humility;\r\nIndeed, left nothing fitting for your purpose\r\nUntouched or slightly handled in discourse.\r\nAnd when mine oratory drew toward end,\r\nI bid them that did love their country’s good\r\nCry “God save Richard, England’s royal King!”\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nAnd did they so?\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM.\r\nNo, so God help me, they spake not a word,\r\nBut, like dumb statues or breathing stones,\r\nStared each on other, and looked deadly pale.\r\nWhich when I saw, I reprehended them,\r\nAnd asked the Mayor what meant this wilful silence.\r\nHis answer was, the people were not used\r\nTo be spoke to but by the Recorder.\r\nThen he was urged to tell my tale again:\r\n“Thus saith the Duke, thus hath the Duke inferred”\r\nBut nothing spoke in warrant from himself.\r\nWhen he had done, some followers of mine own,\r\nAt lower end of the hall, hurled up their caps,\r\nAnd some ten voices cried, “God save King Richard!”\r\nAnd thus I took the vantage of those few.\r\n“Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,” quoth I;\r\n“This general applause and cheerful shout\r\nArgues your wisdoms and your love to Richard.”\r\nAnd even here brake off and came away.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nWhat, tongueless blocks were they! Would they not speak?\r\nWill not the Mayor then and his brethren, come?\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM.\r\nThe mayor is here at hand. Intend some fear;\r\nBe not you spoke with but by mighty suit.\r\nAnd look you get a prayer-book in your hand,\r\nAnd stand between two churchmen, good my lord,\r\nFor on that ground I’ll make a holy descant.\r\nAnd be not easily won to our requests.\r\nPlay the maid’s part: still answer nay, and take it.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nI go, and if you plead as well for them\r\nAs I can say nay to thee for myself,\r\nNo doubt we bring it to a happy issue.\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM.\r\nGo, go, up to the leads, the Lord Mayor knocks.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Richard._]\r\n\r\nEnter the Lord Mayor and Citizens.\r\n\r\nWelcome, my lord. I dance attendance here.\r\nI think the Duke will not be spoke withal.\r\n\r\nEnter Catesby.\r\n\r\nNow, Catesby, what says your lord to my request?\r\n\r\nCATESBY.\r\nHe doth entreat your Grace, my noble lord,\r\nTo visit him tomorrow or next day.\r\nHe is within, with two right reverend fathers,\r\nDivinely bent to meditation;\r\nAnd in no worldly suits would he be moved\r\nTo draw him from his holy exercise.\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM.\r\nReturn, good Catesby, to the gracious Duke;\r\nTell him myself, the Mayor and aldermen,\r\nIn deep designs, in matter of great moment,\r\nNo less importing than our general good,\r\nAre come to have some conference with his Grace.\r\n\r\nCATESBY.\r\nI’ll signify so much unto him straight.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM.\r\nAh ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!\r\nHe is not lolling on a lewd love-bed,\r\nBut on his knees at meditation;\r\nNot dallying with a brace of courtesans,\r\nBut meditating with two deep divines;\r\nNot sleeping, to engross his idle body,\r\nBut praying, to enrich his watchful soul.\r\nHappy were England would this virtuous prince\r\nTake on his Grace the sovereignty thereof.\r\nBut sure I fear we shall not win him to it.\r\n\r\nMAYOR.\r\nMarry, God defend his Grace should say us nay!\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM.\r\nI fear he will. Here Catesby comes again.\r\n\r\nEnter Catesby.\r\n\r\nNow, Catesby, what says his Grace?\r\n\r\nCATESBY.\r\nHe wonders to what end you have assembled\r\nSuch troops of citizens to come to him,\r\nHis Grace not being warned thereof before.\r\nHe fears, my lord, you mean no good to him.\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM.\r\nSorry I am my noble cousin should\r\nSuspect me that I mean no good to him.\r\nBy heaven, we come to him in perfect love,\r\nAnd so once more return and tell his Grace.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Catesby._]\r\n\r\nWhen holy and devout religious men\r\nAre at their beads, ’tis much to draw them thence,\r\nSo sweet is zealous contemplation.\r\n\r\nEnter Richard aloft, between two Bishops.

Would it might please your Grace,\r\nOn our entreaties, to amend your fault.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nElse wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM.\r\nKnow then, it is your fault that you resign\r\nThe supreme seat, the throne majestical,\r\nThe sceptered office of your ancestors,\r\nYour state of fortune, and your due of birth,\r\nThe lineal glory of your royal house,\r\nTo the corruption of a blemished stock;\r\nWhiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,\r\nWhich here we waken to our country’s good,\r\nThe noble isle doth want her proper limbs;\r\nHer face defaced with scars of infamy,\r\nHer royal stock graft with ignoble plants,\r\nAnd almost shouldered in the swallowing gulf\r\nOf dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion;\r\nWhich to recure, we heartily solicit\r\nYour gracious self to take on you the charge\r\nAnd kingly government of this your land,\r\nNot as Protector, steward, substitute,\r\nOr lowly factor for another’s gain,\r\nBut as successively, from blood to blood,\r\nYour right of birth, your empery, your own.\r\nFor this, consorted with the citizens,\r\nYour very worshipful and loving friends,\r\nAnd by their vehement instigation,\r\nIn this just cause come I to move your Grace.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nI cannot tell if to depart in silence\r\nOr bitterly to speak in your reproof\r\nBest fitteth my degree or your condition.\r\nIf not to answer, you might haply think\r\nTongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded\r\nTo bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,\r\nWhich fondly you would here impose on me;\r\nIf to reprove you for this suit of yours,\r\nSo seasoned with your faithful love to me,\r\nThen, on the other side, I checked my friends.\r\nTherefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,\r\nAnd then, in speaking, not to incur the last,\r\nDefinitively thus I answer you:\r\nYour love deserves my thanks, but my desert\r\nUnmeritable shuns your high request.\r\nFirst, if all obstacles were cut away,\r\nAnd that my path were even to the crown\r\nAs the ripe revenue and due of birth,\r\nYet so much is my poverty of spirit,\r\nSo mighty and so many my defects,\r\nThat I would rather hide me from my greatness,\r\nBeing a bark to brook no mighty sea,\r\nThan in my greatness covet to be hid,\r\nAnd in the vapour of my glory smothered.\r\nBut, God be thanked, there is no need of me,\r\nAnd much I need to help you, were there need.\r\nThe royal tree hath left us royal fruit,\r\nWhich, mellowed by the stealing hours of time,\r\nWill well become the seat of majesty,\r\nAnd make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.\r\nOn him I lay that you would lay on me,\r\nThe right and fortune of his happy stars,\r\nWhich God defend that I should wring from him.\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM.\r\nMy lord, this argues conscience in your Grace;\r\nBut the respects thereof are nice and trivial,\r\nAll circumstances well considered.\r\nYou say that Edward is your brother’s son;\r\nSo say we too, but not by Edward’s wife.\r\nFor first was he contract to Lady Lucy\r\nYour mother lives a witness to his vow,\r\nAnd afterward by substitute betrothed\r\nTo Bona, sister to the King of France.\r\nThese both put off, a poor petitioner,\r\nA care-crazed mother to a many sons,\r\nA beauty-waning and distressed widow,\r\nEven in the afternoon of her best days,\r\nMade prize and purchase of his wanton eye,\r\nSeduced the pitch and height of his degree\r\nTo base declension and loathed bigamy.\r\nBy her, in his unlawful bed, he got\r\nThis Edward, whom our manners call the Prince.\r\nMore bitterly could I expostulate,\r\nSave that, for reverence to some alive,\r\nI give a sparing limit to my tongue.\r\nThen, good my lord, take to your royal self\r\nThis proffered benefit of dignity,\r\nIf not to bless us and the land withal,\r\nYet to draw forth your noble ancestry\r\nFrom the corruption of abusing times\r\nUnto a lineal true-derived course.\r\n\r\nMAYOR.\r\nDo, good my lord. Your citizens entreat you.\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM.\r\nRefuse not, mighty lord, this proffered love.\r\n\r\nCATESBY.\r\nO, make them joyful; grant their lawful suit.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nAlas, why would you heap those cares on me?\r\nI am unfit for state and majesty.\r\nI do beseech you, take it not amiss;\r\nI cannot, nor I will not, yield to you.\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM.\r\nIf you refuse it, as in love and zeal\r\nLoath to depose the child, your brother’s son—\r\nAs well we know your tenderness of heart\r\nAnd gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,\r\nWhich we have noted in you to your kindred,\r\nAnd equally indeed to all estates—\r\nYet know, whe’er you accept our suit or no,\r\nYour brother’s son shall never reign our king,\r\nBut we will plant some other in the throne,\r\nTo the disgrace and downfall of your house.\r\nAnd in this resolution here we leave you.\r\nCome, citizens; zounds, I’ll entreat no more.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Buckingham, the Mayor and citizens._]\r\n\r\nCATESBY.\r\nCall him again, sweet Prince; accept their suit.\r\nIf you deny them, all the land will rue it.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nWill you enforce me to a world of cares?\r\nCall them again. I am not made of stones,\r\nBut penetrable to your kind entreaties,\r\nAlbeit against my conscience and my soul.\r\n\r\nEnter Buckingham and the rest.\r\n\r\nCousin of Buckingham, and sage grave men,\r\nSince you will buckle Fortune on my back,\r\nTo bear her burden, whe’er I will or no,\r\nI must have patience to endure the load.\r\nBut if black scandal or foul-faced reproach\r\nAttend the sequel of your imposition,\r\nYour mere enforcement shall acquittance me\r\nFrom all the impure blots and stains thereof,\r\nFor God doth know, and you may partly see,\r\nHow far I am from the desire of this.\r\n\r\nMAYOR.\r\nGod bless your Grace! We see it, and will say it.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nIn saying so, you shall but say the truth.\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM.\r\nThen I salute you with this royal title:\r\nLong live King Richard, England’s worthy King!\r\n\r\nALL.\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM.\r\nTomorrow may it please you to be crowned?\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\nEven when you please, for you will have it so.\r\n\r\nBUCKINGHAM.\r\nTomorrow, then, we will attend your Grace;\r\nAnd so most joyfully we take our leave.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\n[_To the Bishops_.] Come, let us to our holy work again.\r\nFarewell, my cousin, farewell, gentle friends.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\nACT IV\r\n\r\nSCENE I.

Why? When he that is my husband now\r\nCame to me as I followed Henry’s corse,\r\nWhen scarce the blood was well washed from his hands\r\nWhich issued from my other angel husband,\r\nAnd that dear saint which then I weeping followed;\r\nO, when, I say, I looked on Richard’s face,\r\nThis was my wish: “Be thou,” quoth I, “accursed\r\nFor making me, so young, so old a widow;\r\nAnd when thou wedd’st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;\r\nAnd be thy wife, if any be so mad,\r\nMore miserable by the life of thee\r\nThan thou hast made me by my dear lord’s death.”\r\nLo, ere I can repeat this curse again,\r\nWithin so small a time, my woman’s heart\r\nGrossly grew captive to his honey words,\r\nAnd proved the subject of mine own soul’s curse,\r\nWhich hitherto hath held my eyes from rest;\r\nFor never yet one hour in his bed\r\nDid I enjoy the golden dew of sleep,\r\nBut with his timorous dreams was still awaked.\r\nBesides, he hates me for my father Warwick,\r\nAnd will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.\r\n\r\nQUEEN ELIZABETH.\r\nPoor heart, adieu; I pity thy complaining.\r\n\r\nANNE.\r\nNo more than with my soul I mourn for yours.\r\n\r\nDORSET.\r\nFarewell, thou woeful welcomer of glory.\r\n\r\nANNE.\r\nAdieu, poor soul, that tak’st thy leave of it.\r\n\r\nDUCHESS.\r\n[_To Dorset._] Go thou to Richmond, and good fortune guide thee.\r\n[_To Anne._] Go thou to Richard, and good angels tend thee.\r\n[_To Queen Elizabeth._] Go thou to sanctuary, and good thoughts possess\r\nthee.\r\nI to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me.\r\nEighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,\r\nAnd each hour’s joy wracked with a week of teen.\r\n\r\nQUEEN ELIZABETH.\r\nStay, yet look back with me unto the Tower.\r\nPity, you ancient stones, those tender babes\r\nWhom envy hath immured within your walls—\r\nRough cradle for such little pretty one,\r\nRude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow\r\nFor tender princes, use my babies well.\r\nSo foolish sorrows bids your stones farewell.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II.

So please you step aside;\r\nI’ll know his grievance or be much denied.\r\n\r\nMONTAGUE.\r\nI would thou wert so happy by thy stay\r\nTo hear true shrift.

O me! What fray was here?\r\nYet tell me not, for I have heard it all.\r\nHere’s much to do with hate, but more with love:\r\nWhy, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!\r\nO anything, of nothing first create!\r\nO heavy lightness! serious vanity!\r\nMisshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!\r\nFeather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!\r\nStill-waking sleep, that is not what it is!\r\nThis love feel I, that feel no love in this.\r\nDost thou not laugh?\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nNo coz, I rather weep.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nGood heart, at what?\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nAt thy good heart’s oppression.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nWhy such is love’s transgression.\r\nGriefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,\r\nWhich thou wilt propagate to have it prest\r\nWith more of thine.

A madness most discreet,\r\nA choking gall, and a preserving sweet.\r\nFarewell, my coz.\r\n\r\n [_Going._]\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nSoft!

Nurse, come back again,\r\nI have remember’d me, thou’s hear our counsel.\r\nThou knowest my daughter’s of a pretty age.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nFaith, I can tell her age unto an hour.\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nShe’s not fourteen.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nI’ll lay fourteen of my teeth,\r\nAnd yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four,\r\nShe is not fourteen. How long is it now\r\nTo Lammas-tide?\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nA fortnight and odd days.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nEven or odd, of all days in the year,\r\nCome Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.\r\nSusan and she,—God rest all Christian souls!—\r\nWere of an age. Well, Susan is with God;\r\nShe was too good for me. But as I said,\r\nOn Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;\r\nThat shall she, marry; I remember it well.\r\n’Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;\r\nAnd she was wean’d,—I never shall forget it—,\r\nOf all the days of the year, upon that day:\r\nFor I had then laid wormwood to my dug,\r\nSitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall;\r\nMy lord and you were then at Mantua:\r\nNay, I do bear a brain. But as I said,\r\nWhen it did taste the wormwood on the nipple\r\nOf my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,\r\nTo see it tetchy, and fall out with the dug!\r\nShake, quoth the dovehouse: ’twas no need, I trow,\r\nTo bid me trudge.\r\nAnd since that time it is eleven years;\r\nFor then she could stand alone; nay, by th’rood\r\nShe could have run and waddled all about;\r\nFor even the day before she broke her brow,\r\nAnd then my husband,—God be with his soul!\r\nA was a merry man,—took up the child:\r\n‘Yea,’ quoth he, ‘dost thou fall upon thy face?\r\nThou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;\r\nWilt thou not, Jule?’ and, by my holidame,\r\nThe pretty wretch left crying, and said ‘Ay’.\r\nTo see now how a jest shall come about.\r\nI warrant, and I should live a thousand years,\r\nI never should forget it. ‘Wilt thou not, Jule?’ quoth he;\r\nAnd, pretty fool, it stinted, and said ‘Ay.’\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nEnough of this; I pray thee hold thy peace.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nYes, madam, yet I cannot choose but laugh,\r\nTo think it should leave crying, and say ‘Ay’;\r\nAnd yet I warrant it had upon it brow\r\nA bump as big as a young cockerel’s stone;\r\nA perilous knock, and it cried bitterly.\r\n‘Yea,’ quoth my husband, ‘fall’st upon thy face?\r\nThou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;\r\nWilt thou not, Jule?’ it stinted, and said ‘Ay’.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nAnd stint thou too, I pray thee, Nurse, say I.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nPeace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace\r\nThou wast the prettiest babe that e’er I nurs’d:\r\nAnd I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nMarry, that marry is the very theme\r\nI came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,\r\nHow stands your disposition to be married?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nIt is an honour that I dream not of.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nAn honour! Were not I thine only nurse,\r\nI would say thou hadst suck’d wisdom from thy teat.\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nWell, think of marriage now: younger than you,\r\nHere in Verona, ladies of esteem,\r\nAre made already mothers. By my count\r\nI was your mother much upon these years\r\nThat you are now a maid. Thus, then, in brief;\r\nThe valiant Paris seeks you for his love.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nA man, young lady! Lady, such a man\r\nAs all the world—why he’s a man of wax.\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nVerona’s summer hath not such a flower.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nNay, he’s a flower, in faith a very flower.\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nWhat say you, can you love the gentleman?\r\nThis night you shall behold him at our feast;\r\nRead o’er the volume of young Paris’ face,\r\nAnd find delight writ there with beauty’s pen.\r\nExamine every married lineament,\r\nAnd see how one another lends content;\r\nAnd what obscur’d in this fair volume lies,\r\nFind written in the margent of his eyes.\r\nThis precious book of love, this unbound lover,\r\nTo beautify him, only lacks a cover:\r\nThe fish lives in the sea; and ’tis much pride\r\nFor fair without the fair within to hide.\r\nThat book in many’s eyes doth share the glory,\r\nThat in gold clasps locks in the golden story;\r\nSo shall you share all that he doth possess,\r\nBy having him, making yourself no less.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nNo less, nay bigger. Women grow by men.\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nSpeak briefly, can you like of Paris’ love?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nI’ll look to like, if looking liking move:\r\nBut no more deep will I endart mine eye\r\nThan your consent gives strength to make it fly.\r\n\r\n Enter a Servant.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nMadam, the guests are come, supper served up, you called, my young lady\r\nasked for, the Nurse cursed in the pantry, and everything in extremity.\r\nI must hence to wait, I beseech you follow straight.\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nWe follow thee.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Servant._]\r\n\r\nJuliet, the County stays.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nGo, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV. A Street.\r\n\r\n Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six Maskers;\r\n Torch-bearers and others.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nWhat, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?\r\nOr shall we on without apology?\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nThe date is out of such prolixity:\r\nWe’ll have no Cupid hoodwink’d with a scarf,\r\nBearing a Tartar’s painted bow of lath,\r\nScaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;\r\nNor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke\r\nAfter the prompter, for our entrance:\r\nBut let them measure us by what they will,\r\nWe’ll measure them a measure, and be gone.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nGive me a torch, I am not for this ambling;\r\nBeing but heavy I will bear the light.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nNay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nNot I, believe me, you have dancing shoes,\r\nWith nimble soles, I have a soul of lead\r\nSo stakes me to the ground I cannot move.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nYou are a lover, borrow Cupid’s wings,\r\nAnd soar with them above a common bound.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nI am too sore enpierced with his shaft\r\nTo soar with his light feathers, and so bound,\r\nI cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.\r\nUnder love’s heavy burden do I sink.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nAnd, to sink in it, should you burden love;\r\nToo great oppression for a tender thing.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nIs love a tender thing? It is too rough,\r\nToo rude, too boisterous; and it pricks like thorn.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nIf love be rough with you, be rough with love;\r\nPrick love for pricking, and you beat love down.\r\nGive me a case to put my visage in: [_Putting on a mask._]\r\nA visor for a visor. What care I\r\nWhat curious eye doth quote deformities?\r\nHere are the beetle-brows shall blush for me.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nCome, knock and enter; and no sooner in\r\nBut every man betake him to his legs.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nA torch for me: let wantons, light of heart,\r\nTickle the senseless rushes with their heels;\r\nFor I am proverb’d with a grandsire phrase,\r\nI’ll be a candle-holder and look on,\r\nThe game was ne’er so fair, and I am done.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nTut, dun’s the mouse, the constable’s own word:\r\nIf thou art dun, we’ll draw thee from the mire\r\nOr save your reverence love, wherein thou stickest\r\nUp to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nNay, that’s not so.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nI mean sir, in delay\r\nWe waste our lights in vain, light lights by day.\r\nTake our good meaning, for our judgment sits\r\nFive times in that ere once in our five wits.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nAnd we mean well in going to this mask;\r\nBut ’tis no wit to go.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nWhy, may one ask?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nI dreamt a dream tonight.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nAnd so did I.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nWell what was yours?\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nThat dreamers often lie.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nIn bed asleep, while they do dream things true.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nO, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.\r\nShe is the fairies’ midwife, and she comes\r\nIn shape no bigger than an agate-stone\r\nOn the fore-finger of an alderman,\r\nDrawn with a team of little atomies\r\nOver men’s noses as they lie asleep:\r\nHer waggon-spokes made of long spinners’ legs;\r\nThe cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;\r\nHer traces, of the smallest spider’s web;\r\nThe collars, of the moonshine’s watery beams;\r\nHer whip of cricket’s bone; the lash, of film;\r\nHer waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat,\r\nNot half so big as a round little worm\r\nPrick’d from the lazy finger of a maid:\r\nHer chariot is an empty hazelnut,\r\nMade by the joiner squirrel or old grub,\r\nTime out o’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers.\r\nAnd in this state she gallops night by night\r\nThrough lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;\r\nO’er courtiers’ knees, that dream on curtsies straight;\r\nO’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees;\r\nO’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,\r\nWhich oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,\r\nBecause their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:\r\nSometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,\r\nAnd then dreams he of smelling out a suit;\r\nAnd sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail,\r\nTickling a parson’s nose as a lies asleep,\r\nThen dreams he of another benefice:\r\nSometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,\r\nAnd then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,\r\nOf breaches, ambuscados, Spanish blades,\r\nOf healths five fathom deep; and then anon\r\nDrums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes;\r\nAnd, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,\r\nAnd sleeps again. This is that very Mab\r\nThat plats the manes of horses in the night;\r\nAnd bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,\r\nWhich, once untangled, much misfortune bodes:\r\nThis is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,\r\nThat presses them, and learns them first to bear,\r\nMaking them women of good carriage:\r\nThis is she,—\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nPeace, peace, Mercutio, peace,\r\nThou talk’st of nothing.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nTrue, I talk of dreams,\r\nWhich are the children of an idle brain,\r\nBegot of nothing but vain fantasy,\r\nWhich is as thin of substance as the air,\r\nAnd more inconstant than the wind, who woos\r\nEven now the frozen bosom of the north,\r\nAnd, being anger’d, puffs away from thence,\r\nTurning his side to the dew-dropping south.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nThis wind you talk of blows us from ourselves:\r\nSupper is done, and we shall come too late.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nI fear too early: for my mind misgives\r\nSome consequence yet hanging in the stars,\r\nShall bitterly begin his fearful date\r\nWith this night’s revels; and expire the term\r\nOf a despised life, clos’d in my breast\r\nBy some vile forfeit of untimely death.\r\nBut he that hath the steerage of my course\r\nDirect my suit. On, lusty gentlemen!\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nStrike, drum.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE V. A Hall in Capulet’s House.\r\n\r\n Musicians waiting.

She that makes dainty,\r\nShe I’ll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now?\r\nWelcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day\r\nThat I have worn a visor, and could tell\r\nA whispering tale in a fair lady’s ear,\r\nSuch as would please; ’tis gone, ’tis gone, ’tis gone,\r\nYou are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.\r\nA hall, a hall, give room!

Forswear it, sight!\r\nFor I ne’er saw true beauty till this night.\r\n\r\nTYBALT.\r\nThis by his voice, should be a Montague.\r\nFetch me my rapier, boy.

What of that?\r\nHer eye discourses, I will answer it.\r\nI am too bold, ’tis not to me she speaks.\r\nTwo of the fairest stars in all the heaven,\r\nHaving some business, do entreat her eyes\r\nTo twinkle in their spheres till they return.\r\nWhat if her eyes were there, they in her head?\r\nThe brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,\r\nAs daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven\r\nWould through the airy region stream so bright\r\nThat birds would sing and think it were not night.\r\nSee how she leans her cheek upon her hand.\r\nO that I were a glove upon that hand,\r\nThat I might touch that cheek.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nAy me.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nShe speaks.\r\nO speak again bright angel, for thou art\r\nAs glorious to this night, being o’er my head,\r\nAs is a winged messenger of heaven\r\nUnto the white-upturned wondering eyes\r\nOf mortals that fall back to gaze on him\r\nWhen he bestrides the lazy-puffing clouds\r\nAnd sails upon the bosom of the air.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nO Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?\r\nDeny thy father and refuse thy name.\r\nOr if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,\r\nAnd I’ll no longer be a Capulet.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\n[_Aside._] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\n’Tis but thy name that is my enemy;\r\nThou art thyself, though not a Montague.\r\nWhat’s Montague? It is nor hand nor foot,\r\nNor arm, nor face, nor any other part\r\nBelonging to a man. O be some other name.\r\nWhat’s in a name? That which we call a rose\r\nBy any other name would smell as sweet;\r\nSo Romeo would, were he not Romeo call’d,\r\nRetain that dear perfection which he owes\r\nWithout that title. Romeo, doff thy name,\r\nAnd for thy name, which is no part of thee,\r\nTake all myself.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nI take thee at thy word.\r\nCall me but love, and I’ll be new baptis’d;\r\nHenceforth I never will be Romeo.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nWhat man art thou that, thus bescreen’d in night\r\nSo stumblest on my counsel?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nBy a name\r\nI know not how to tell thee who I am:\r\nMy name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,\r\nBecause it is an enemy to thee.\r\nHad I it written, I would tear the word.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nMy ears have yet not drunk a hundred words\r\nOf thy tongue’s utterance, yet I know the sound.\r\nArt thou not Romeo, and a Montague?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nNeither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nHow cam’st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?\r\nThe orchard walls are high and hard to climb,\r\nAnd the place death, considering who thou art,\r\nIf any of my kinsmen find thee here.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nWith love’s light wings did I o’erperch these walls,\r\nFor stony limits cannot hold love out,\r\nAnd what love can do, that dares love attempt:\r\nTherefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nIf they do see thee, they will murder thee.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nAlack, there lies more peril in thine eye\r\nThan twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet,\r\nAnd I am proof against their enmity.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nI would not for the world they saw thee here.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nI have night’s cloak to hide me from their eyes,\r\nAnd but thou love me, let them find me here.\r\nMy life were better ended by their hate\r\nThan death prorogued, wanting of thy love.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nBy whose direction found’st thou out this place?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nBy love, that first did prompt me to enquire;\r\nHe lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.\r\nI am no pilot; yet wert thou as far\r\nAs that vast shore wash’d with the farthest sea,\r\nI should adventure for such merchandise.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nThou knowest the mask of night is on my face,\r\nElse would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek\r\nFor that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.\r\nFain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny\r\nWhat I have spoke; but farewell compliment.\r\nDost thou love me? I know thou wilt say Ay,\r\nAnd I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear’st,\r\nThou mayst prove false. At lovers’ perjuries,\r\nThey say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,\r\nIf thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.\r\nOr if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,\r\nI’ll frown and be perverse, and say thee nay,\r\nSo thou wilt woo. But else, not for the world.\r\nIn truth, fair Montague, I am too fond;\r\nAnd therefore thou mayst think my ’haviour light:\r\nBut trust me, gentleman, I’ll prove more true\r\nThan those that have more cunning to be strange.\r\nI should have been more strange, I must confess,\r\nBut that thou overheard’st, ere I was ’ware,\r\nMy true-love passion; therefore pardon me,\r\nAnd not impute this yielding to light love,\r\nWhich the dark night hath so discovered.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nLady, by yonder blessed moon I vow,\r\nThat tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops,—\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nO swear not by the moon, th’inconstant moon,\r\nThat monthly changes in her circled orb,\r\nLest that thy love prove likewise variable.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nWhat shall I swear by?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nDo not swear at all.\r\nOr if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,\r\nWhich is the god of my idolatry,\r\nAnd I’ll believe thee.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nIf my heart’s dear love,—\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nWell, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,\r\nI have no joy of this contract tonight;\r\nIt is too rash, too unadvis’d, too sudden,\r\nToo like the lightning, which doth cease to be\r\nEre one can say “It lightens.” Sweet, good night.\r\nThis bud of love, by summer’s ripening breath,\r\nMay prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.\r\nGood night, good night. As sweet repose and rest\r\nCome to thy heart as that within my breast.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nO wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nWhat satisfaction canst thou have tonight?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nTh’exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nI gave thee mine before thou didst request it;\r\nAnd yet I would it were to give again.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nWould’st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nBut to be frank and give it thee again.\r\nAnd yet I wish but for the thing I have;\r\nMy bounty is as boundless as the sea,\r\nMy love as deep; the more I give to thee,\r\nThe more I have, for both are infinite.\r\nI hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu.\r\n[_Nurse calls within._]\r\nAnon, good Nurse!—Sweet Montague be true.\r\nStay but a little, I will come again.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nO blessed, blessed night. I am afeard,\r\nBeing in night, all this is but a dream,\r\nToo flattering sweet to be substantial.\r\n\r\n Enter Juliet above.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nThree words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.\r\nIf that thy bent of love be honourable,\r\nThy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow,\r\nBy one that I’ll procure to come to thee,\r\nWhere and what time thou wilt perform the rite,\r\nAnd all my fortunes at thy foot I’ll lay\r\nAnd follow thee my lord throughout the world.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\n[_Within._] Madam.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nI come, anon.— But if thou meanest not well,\r\nI do beseech thee,—\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\n[_Within._] Madam.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nBy and by I come—\r\nTo cease thy strife and leave me to my grief.\r\nTomorrow will I send.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nSo thrive my soul,—\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nA thousand times good night.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nA thousand times the worse, to want thy light.\r\nLove goes toward love as schoolboys from their books,\r\nBut love from love, towards school with heavy looks.\r\n\r\n [_Retiring slowly._]\r\n\r\n Re-enter Juliet, above.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nHist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer’s voice\r\nTo lure this tassel-gentle back again.\r\nBondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud,\r\nElse would I tear the cave where Echo lies,\r\nAnd make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine\r\nWith repetition of my Romeo’s name.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nIt is my soul that calls upon my name.\r\nHow silver-sweet sound lovers’ tongues by night,\r\nLike softest music to attending ears.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nRomeo.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nMy nyas?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nWhat o’clock tomorrow\r\nShall I send to thee?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nBy the hour of nine.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nI will not fail. ’Tis twenty years till then.\r\nI have forgot why I did call thee back.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nLet me stand here till thou remember it.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nI shall forget, to have thee still stand there,\r\nRemembering how I love thy company.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nAnd I’ll still stay, to have thee still forget,\r\nForgetting any other home but this.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\n’Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone,\r\nAnd yet no farther than a wanton’s bird,\r\nThat lets it hop a little from her hand,\r\nLike a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,\r\nAnd with a silk thread plucks it back again,\r\nSo loving-jealous of his liberty.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nI would I were thy bird.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nSweet, so would I:\r\nYet I should kill thee with much cherishing.\r\nGood night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow\r\nThat I shall say good night till it be morrow.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nSleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast.\r\nWould I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest.\r\nHence will I to my ghostly Sire’s cell,\r\nHis help to crave and my dear hap to tell.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. Friar Lawrence’s Cell.\r\n\r\n Enter Friar Lawrence with a basket.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nThe grey-ey’d morn smiles on the frowning night,\r\nChequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light;\r\nAnd fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels\r\nFrom forth day’s pathway, made by Titan’s fiery wheels\r\nNow, ere the sun advance his burning eye,\r\nThe day to cheer, and night’s dank dew to dry,\r\nI must upfill this osier cage of ours\r\nWith baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.\r\nThe earth that’s nature’s mother, is her tomb;\r\nWhat is her burying grave, that is her womb:\r\nAnd from her womb children of divers kind\r\nWe sucking on her natural bosom find.\r\nMany for many virtues excellent,\r\nNone but for some, and yet all different.\r\nO, mickle is the powerful grace that lies\r\nIn plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities.\r\nFor naught so vile that on the earth doth live\r\nBut to the earth some special good doth give;\r\nNor aught so good but, strain’d from that fair use,\r\nRevolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.\r\nVirtue itself turns vice being misapplied,\r\nAnd vice sometime’s by action dignified.\r\n\r\n Enter Romeo.\r\n\r\nWithin the infant rind of this weak flower\r\nPoison hath residence, and medicine power:\r\nFor this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;\r\nBeing tasted, slays all senses with the heart.\r\nTwo such opposed kings encamp them still\r\nIn man as well as herbs,—grace and rude will;\r\nAnd where the worser is predominant,\r\nFull soon the canker death eats up that plant.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nGood morrow, father.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nBenedicite!\r\nWhat early tongue so sweet saluteth me?\r\nYoung son, it argues a distemper’d head\r\nSo soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.\r\nCare keeps his watch in every old man’s eye,\r\nAnd where care lodges sleep will never lie;\r\nBut where unbruised youth with unstuff’d brain\r\nDoth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.\r\nTherefore thy earliness doth me assure\r\nThou art uprous’d with some distemperature;\r\nOr if not so, then here I hit it right,\r\nOur Romeo hath not been in bed tonight.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nThat last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nGod pardon sin. Wast thou with Rosaline?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nWith Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.\r\nI have forgot that name, and that name’s woe.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nThat’s my good son. But where hast thou been then?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nI’ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.\r\nI have been feasting with mine enemy,\r\nWhere on a sudden one hath wounded me\r\nThat’s by me wounded. Both our remedies\r\nWithin thy help and holy physic lies.\r\nI bear no hatred, blessed man; for lo,\r\nMy intercession likewise steads my foe.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nBe plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;\r\nRiddling confession finds but riddling shrift.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nThen plainly know my heart’s dear love is set\r\nOn the fair daughter of rich Capulet.\r\nAs mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;\r\nAnd all combin’d, save what thou must combine\r\nBy holy marriage. When, and where, and how\r\nWe met, we woo’d, and made exchange of vow,\r\nI’ll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,\r\nThat thou consent to marry us today.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nHoly Saint Francis! What a change is here!\r\nIs Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,\r\nSo soon forsaken? Young men’s love then lies\r\nNot truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.\r\nJesu Maria, what a deal of brine\r\nHath wash’d thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!\r\nHow much salt water thrown away in waste,\r\nTo season love, that of it doth not taste.\r\nThe sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,\r\nThy old groans yet ring in mine ancient ears.\r\nLo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit\r\nOf an old tear that is not wash’d off yet.\r\nIf ere thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,\r\nThou and these woes were all for Rosaline,\r\nAnd art thou chang’d? Pronounce this sentence then,\r\nWomen may fall, when there’s no strength in men.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nThou chidd’st me oft for loving Rosaline.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nFor doting, not for loving, pupil mine.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nAnd bad’st me bury love.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nNot in a grave\r\nTo lay one in, another out to have.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nI pray thee chide me not, her I love now\r\nDoth grace for grace and love for love allow.\r\nThe other did not so.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nO, she knew well\r\nThy love did read by rote, that could not spell.\r\nBut come young waverer, come go with me,\r\nIn one respect I’ll thy assistant be;\r\nFor this alliance may so happy prove,\r\nTo turn your households’ rancour to pure love.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nO let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nWisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV. A Street.\r\n\r\n Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nWhere the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home tonight?\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nNot to his father’s; I spoke with his man.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nWhy, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, torments him so\r\nthat he will sure run mad.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nTybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet, hath sent a letter to his father’s\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nA challenge, on my life.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nRomeo will answer it.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nAny man that can write may answer a letter.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nNay, he will answer the letter’s master, how he dares, being dared.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nAlas poor Romeo, he is already dead, stabbed with a white wench’s black\r\neye; run through the ear with a love song, the very pin of his heart\r\ncleft with the blind bow-boy’s butt-shaft. And is he a man to encounter\r\nTybalt?\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nWhy, what is Tybalt?\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nMore than Prince of cats. O, he’s the courageous captain of\r\ncompliments. He fights as you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance,\r\nand proportion. He rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in\r\nyour bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist;\r\na gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah,\r\nthe immortal passado, the punto reverso, the hay.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nThe what?\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nThe pox of such antic lisping, affecting phantasies; these new tuners\r\nof accent. By Jesu, a very good blade, a very tall man, a very good\r\nwhore. Why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsire, that we should\r\nbe thus afflicted with these strange flies, these fashion-mongers,\r\nthese pardon-me’s, who stand so much on the new form that they cannot\r\nsit at ease on the old bench? O their bones, their bones!\r\n\r\n Enter Romeo.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nHere comes Romeo, here comes Romeo!\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nWithout his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how art thou\r\nfishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in. Laura, to\r\nhis lady, was but a kitchen wench,—marry, she had a better love to\r\nberhyme her: Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gypsy; Helen and Hero hildings\r\nand harlots; Thisbe a grey eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior\r\nRomeo, bonjour! There’s a French salutation to your French slop. You\r\ngave us the counterfeit fairly last night.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nGood morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nThe slip sir, the slip; can you not conceive?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nPardon, good Mercutio, my business was great, and in such a case as\r\nmine a man may strain courtesy.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nThat’s as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow\r\nin the hams.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nMeaning, to curtsy.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nThou hast most kindly hit it.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nA most courteous exposition.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nNay, I am the very pink of courtesy.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nPink for flower.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nRight.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nWhy, then is my pump well flowered.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nSure wit, follow me this jest now, till thou hast worn out thy pump,\r\nthat when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may remain after the\r\nwearing, solely singular.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nO single-soled jest, solely singular for the singleness!\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nCome between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nSwits and spurs, swits and spurs; or I’ll cry a match.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nNay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done. For thou hast\r\nmore of the wild-goose in one of thy wits, than I am sure, I have in my\r\nwhole five. Was I with you there for the goose?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nThou wast never with me for anything, when thou wast not there for the\r\ngoose.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nI will bite thee by the ear for that jest.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nNay, good goose, bite not.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nThy wit is a very bitter sweeting, it is a most sharp sauce.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nAnd is it not then well served in to a sweet goose?\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nO here’s a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch narrow to an\r\nell broad.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nI stretch it out for that word broad, which added to the goose, proves\r\nthee far and wide a broad goose.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nWhy, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now art thou\r\nsociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as\r\nwell as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a great natural,\r\nthat runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nStop there, stop there.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nThou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nThou wouldst else have made thy tale large.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nO, thou art deceived; I would have made it short, for I was come to the\r\nwhole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to occupy the argument no\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\n Enter Nurse and Peter.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nHere’s goodly gear!\r\nA sail, a sail!\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nTwo, two; a shirt and a smock.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nPeter!\r\n\r\nPETER.\r\nAnon.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nMy fan, Peter.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nGood Peter, to hide her face; for her fan’s the fairer face.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nGod ye good morrow, gentlemen.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nGod ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nIs it good-den?\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\n’Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the\r\nprick of noon.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nOut upon you! What a man are you?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nOne, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nBy my troth, it is well said; for himself to mar, quoth a? Gentlemen,\r\ncan any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nI can tell you: but young Romeo will be older when you have found him\r\nthan he was when you sought him. I am the youngest of that name, for\r\nfault of a worse.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nYou say well.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nYea, is the worst well? Very well took, i’faith; wisely, wisely.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nIf you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nShe will endite him to some supper.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nA bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nWhat hast thou found?\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nNo hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is something\r\nstale and hoar ere it be spent.\r\n[_Sings._]\r\n An old hare hoar,\r\n And an old hare hoar,\r\n Is very good meat in Lent;\r\n But a hare that is hoar\r\n Is too much for a score\r\n When it hoars ere it be spent.\r\nRomeo, will you come to your father’s? We’ll to dinner thither.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nI will follow you.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nFarewell, ancient lady; farewell, lady, lady, lady.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._]\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nI pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this that was so full of his\r\nropery?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nA gentleman, Nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will speak\r\nmore in a minute than he will stand to in a month.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nAnd a speak anything against me, I’ll take him down, and a were lustier\r\nthan he is, and twenty such Jacks. And if I cannot, I’ll find those\r\nthat shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am none of\r\nhis skains-mates.—And thou must stand by too and suffer every knave to\r\nuse me at his pleasure!\r\n\r\nPETER.\r\nI saw no man use you at his pleasure; if I had, my weapon should\r\nquickly have been out. I warrant you, I dare draw as soon as another\r\nman, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my side.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nNow, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me quivers. Scurvy\r\nknave. Pray you, sir, a word: and as I told you, my young lady bid me\r\nenquire you out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself. But first\r\nlet me tell ye, if ye should lead her in a fool’s paradise, as they\r\nsay, it were a very gross kind of behaviour, as they say; for the\r\ngentlewoman is young. And therefore, if you should deal double with\r\nher, truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and\r\nvery weak dealing.\r\n\r\nROMEO. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto\r\nthee,—\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nGood heart, and i’faith I will tell her as much. Lord, Lord, she will\r\nbe a joyful woman.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nWhat wilt thou tell her, Nurse? Thou dost not mark me.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nI will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I take it, is a\r\ngentlemanlike offer.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nBid her devise\r\nSome means to come to shrift this afternoon,\r\nAnd there she shall at Friar Lawrence’ cell\r\nBe shriv’d and married. Here is for thy pains.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nNo truly, sir; not a penny.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nGo to; I say you shall.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nThis afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nAnd stay, good Nurse, behind the abbey wall.\r\nWithin this hour my man shall be with thee,\r\nAnd bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,\r\nWhich to the high topgallant of my joy\r\nMust be my convoy in the secret night.\r\nFarewell, be trusty, and I’ll quit thy pains;\r\nFarewell; commend me to thy mistress.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nNow God in heaven bless thee. Hark you, sir.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nWhat say’st thou, my dear Nurse?\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nIs your man secret? Did you ne’er hear say,\r\nTwo may keep counsel, putting one away?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nI warrant thee my man’s as true as steel.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nWell, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord! When ’twas a\r\nlittle prating thing,—O, there is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that\r\nwould fain lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief see a\r\ntoad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her sometimes, and tell her that\r\nParis is the properer man, but I’ll warrant you, when I say so, she\r\nlooks as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and\r\nRomeo begin both with a letter?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nAy, Nurse; what of that? Both with an R.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nAh, mocker! That’s the dog’s name. R is for the—no, I know it begins\r\nwith some other letter, and she hath the prettiest sententious of it,\r\nof you and rosemary, that it would do you good to hear it.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nCommend me to thy lady.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nAy, a thousand times. Peter!\r\n\r\n [_Exit Romeo._]\r\n\r\nPETER.\r\nAnon.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nBefore and apace.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE V. Capulet’s Garden.\r\n\r\n Enter Juliet.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nThe clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse,\r\nIn half an hour she promised to return.\r\nPerchance she cannot meet him. That’s not so.\r\nO, she is lame. Love’s heralds should be thoughts,\r\nWhich ten times faster glides than the sun’s beams,\r\nDriving back shadows over lowering hills:\r\nTherefore do nimble-pinion’d doves draw love,\r\nAnd therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.\r\nNow is the sun upon the highmost hill\r\nOf this day’s journey, and from nine till twelve\r\nIs three long hours, yet she is not come.\r\nHad she affections and warm youthful blood,\r\nShe’d be as swift in motion as a ball;\r\nMy words would bandy her to my sweet love,\r\nAnd his to me.\r\nBut old folks, many feign as they were dead;\r\nUnwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.\r\n\r\n Enter Nurse and Peter.\r\n\r\nO God, she comes. O honey Nurse, what news?\r\nHast thou met with him? Send thy man away.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nPeter, stay at the gate.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Peter._]\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nNow, good sweet Nurse,—O Lord, why look’st thou sad?\r\nThough news be sad, yet tell them merrily;\r\nIf good, thou sham’st the music of sweet news\r\nBy playing it to me with so sour a face.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nI am aweary, give me leave awhile;\r\nFie, how my bones ache! What a jaunt have I had!\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nI would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:\r\nNay come, I pray thee speak; good, good Nurse, speak.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nJesu, what haste? Can you not stay a while? Do you not see that I am\r\nout of breath?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nHow art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath\r\nTo say to me that thou art out of breath?\r\nThe excuse that thou dost make in this delay\r\nIs longer than the tale thou dost excuse.\r\nIs thy news good or bad? Answer to that;\r\nSay either, and I’ll stay the circumstance.\r\nLet me be satisfied, is’t good or bad?\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nWell, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man.\r\nRomeo? No, not he. Though his face be better than any man’s, yet his\r\nleg excels all men’s, and for a hand and a foot, and a body, though\r\nthey be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare. He is not the\r\nflower of courtesy, but I’ll warrant him as gentle as a lamb. Go thy\r\nways, wench, serve God. What, have you dined at home?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nNo, no. But all this did I know before.\r\nWhat says he of our marriage? What of that?\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nLord, how my head aches! What a head have I!\r\nIt beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.\r\nMy back o’ t’other side,—O my back, my back!\r\nBeshrew your heart for sending me about\r\nTo catch my death with jauncing up and down.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nI’faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.\r\nSweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what says my love?\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nYour love says like an honest gentleman,\r\nAnd a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome,\r\nAnd I warrant a virtuous,—Where is your mother?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nWhere is my mother? Why, she is within.\r\nWhere should she be? How oddly thou repliest.\r\n‘Your love says, like an honest gentleman,\r\n‘Where is your mother?’\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nO God’s lady dear,\r\nAre you so hot? Marry, come up, I trow.\r\nIs this the poultice for my aching bones?\r\nHenceforward do your messages yourself.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nHere’s such a coil. Come, what says Romeo?\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nHave you got leave to go to shrift today?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nI have.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nThen hie you hence to Friar Lawrence’ cell;\r\nThere stays a husband to make you a wife.\r\nNow comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,\r\nThey’ll be in scarlet straight at any news.\r\nHie you to church. I must another way,\r\nTo fetch a ladder by the which your love\r\nMust climb a bird’s nest soon when it is dark.\r\nI am the drudge, and toil in your delight;\r\nBut you shall bear the burden soon at night.\r\nGo. I’ll to dinner; hie you to the cell.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nHie to high fortune! Honest Nurse, farewell.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE VI. Friar Lawrence’s Cell.\r\n\r\n Enter Friar Lawrence and Romeo.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nSo smile the heavens upon this holy act\r\nThat after-hours with sorrow chide us not.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nAmen, amen, but come what sorrow can,\r\nIt cannot countervail the exchange of joy\r\nThat one short minute gives me in her sight.\r\nDo thou but close our hands with holy words,\r\nThen love-devouring death do what he dare,\r\nIt is enough I may but call her mine.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nThese violent delights have violent ends,\r\nAnd in their triumph die; like fire and powder,\r\nWhich as they kiss consume. The sweetest honey\r\nIs loathsome in his own deliciousness,\r\nAnd in the taste confounds the appetite.\r\nTherefore love moderately: long love doth so;\r\nToo swift arrives as tardy as too slow.\r\n\r\n Enter Juliet.\r\n\r\nHere comes the lady. O, so light a foot\r\nWill ne’er wear out the everlasting flint.\r\nA lover may bestride the gossamers\r\nThat idles in the wanton summer air\r\nAnd yet not fall; so light is vanity.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nGood even to my ghostly confessor.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nRomeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nAs much to him, else is his thanks too much.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nAh, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy\r\nBe heap’d like mine, and that thy skill be more\r\nTo blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath\r\nThis neighbour air, and let rich music’s tongue\r\nUnfold the imagin’d happiness that both\r\nReceive in either by this dear encounter.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nConceit more rich in matter than in words,\r\nBrags of his substance, not of ornament.\r\nThey are but beggars that can count their worth;\r\nBut my true love is grown to such excess,\r\nI cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nCome, come with me, and we will make short work,\r\nFor, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone\r\nTill holy church incorporate two in one.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\nACT III\r\n\r\nSCENE I. A public Place.\r\n\n Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, Page and Servants.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nI pray thee, good Mercutio, let’s retire:\r\nThe day is hot, the Capulets abroad,\r\nAnd if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,\r\nFor now these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nThou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of\r\na tavern, claps me his sword upon the table, and says ‘God send me no\r\nneed of thee!’ and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the\r\ndrawer, when indeed there is no need.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nAm I like such a fellow?\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nCome, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy; and as\r\nsoon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nAnd what to?\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nNay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would\r\nkill the other. Thou? Why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a\r\nhair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel\r\nwith a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou\r\nhast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?\r\nThy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy\r\nhead hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast\r\nquarrelled with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath\r\nwakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall\r\nout with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? with\r\nanother for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt\r\ntutor me from quarrelling!\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nAnd I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee\r\nsimple of my life for an hour and a quarter.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nThe fee simple! O simple!\r\n\r\n Enter Tybalt and others.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nBy my head, here comes the Capulets.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nBy my heel, I care not.\r\n\r\nTYBALT.\r\nFollow me close, for I will speak to them.\r\nGentlemen, good-den: a word with one of you.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nAnd but one word with one of us? Couple it with something; make it a\r\nword and a blow.\r\n\r\nTYBALT.\r\nYou shall find me apt enough to that, sir, and you will give me\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nCould you not take some occasion without giving?\r\n\r\nTYBALT.\r\nMercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nConsort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? And thou make minstrels of\r\nus, look to hear nothing but discords. Here’s my fiddlestick, here’s\r\nthat shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nWe talk here in the public haunt of men.\r\nEither withdraw unto some private place,\r\nAnd reason coldly of your grievances,\r\nOr else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nMen’s eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.\r\nI will not budge for no man’s pleasure, I.\r\n\r\n Enter Romeo.\r\n\r\nTYBALT.\r\nWell, peace be with you, sir, here comes my man.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nBut I’ll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.\r\nMarry, go before to field, he’ll be your follower;\r\nYour worship in that sense may call him man.\r\n\r\nTYBALT.\r\nRomeo, the love I bear thee can afford\r\nNo better term than this: Thou art a villain.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nTybalt, the reason that I have to love thee\r\nDoth much excuse the appertaining rage\r\nTo such a greeting. Villain am I none;\r\nTherefore farewell; I see thou know’st me not.\r\n\r\nTYBALT.\r\nBoy, this shall not excuse the injuries\r\nThat thou hast done me, therefore turn and draw.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nI do protest I never injur’d thee,\r\nBut love thee better than thou canst devise\r\nTill thou shalt know the reason of my love.\r\nAnd so good Capulet, which name I tender\r\nAs dearly as mine own, be satisfied.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nO calm, dishonourable, vile submission!\r\n[_Draws._] Alla stoccata carries it away.\r\nTybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?\r\n\r\nTYBALT.\r\nWhat wouldst thou have with me?\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nGood King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives; that I mean to\r\nmake bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest\r\nof the eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears?\r\nMake haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.\r\n\r\nTYBALT.\r\n[_Drawing._] I am for you.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nGentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nCome, sir, your passado.\r\n\r\n [_They fight._]\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nDraw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.\r\nGentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage,\r\nTybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath\r\nForbid this bandying in Verona streets.\r\nHold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Tybalt with his Partizans._]\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nI am hurt.\r\nA plague o’ both your houses. I am sped.\r\nIs he gone, and hath nothing?\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nWhat, art thou hurt?\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nAy, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, ’tis enough.\r\nWhere is my page? Go villain, fetch a surgeon.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Page._]\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nCourage, man; the hurt cannot be much.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nNo, ’tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door, but ’tis\r\nenough, ’twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a\r\ngrave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o’ both\r\nyour houses. Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to\r\ndeath. A braggart, a rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of\r\narithmetic!—Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under your\r\narm.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nI thought all for the best.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nHelp me into some house, Benvolio,\r\nOr I shall faint. A plague o’ both your houses.\r\nThey have made worms’ meat of me.\r\nI have it, and soundly too. Your houses!\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._]\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nThis gentleman, the Prince’s near ally,\r\nMy very friend, hath got his mortal hurt\r\nIn my behalf; my reputation stain’d\r\nWith Tybalt’s slander,—Tybalt, that an hour\r\nHath been my cousin. O sweet Juliet,\r\nThy beauty hath made me effeminate\r\nAnd in my temper soften’d valour’s steel.\r\n\r\n Re-enter Benvolio.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nO Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio’s dead,\r\nThat gallant spirit hath aspir’d the clouds,\r\nWhich too untimely here did scorn the earth.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nThis day’s black fate on mo days doth depend;\r\nThis but begins the woe others must end.\r\n\r\n Re-enter Tybalt.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nHere comes the furious Tybalt back again.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nAgain in triumph, and Mercutio slain?\r\nAway to heaven respective lenity,\r\nAnd fire-ey’d fury be my conduct now!\r\nNow, Tybalt, take the ‘villain’ back again\r\nThat late thou gav’st me, for Mercutio’s soul\r\nIs but a little way above our heads,\r\nStaying for thine to keep him company.\r\nEither thou or I, or both, must go with him.\r\n\r\nTYBALT.\r\nThou wretched boy, that didst consort him here,\r\nShalt with him hence.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nThis shall determine that.\r\n\r\n [_They fight; Tybalt falls._]\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nRomeo, away, be gone!\r\nThe citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.\r\nStand not amaz’d. The Prince will doom thee death\r\nIf thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nO, I am fortune’s fool!\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nWhy dost thou stay?\r\n\r\n [_Exit Romeo._]\r\n\r\n Enter Citizens.\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nWhich way ran he that kill’d Mercutio?\r\nTybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nThere lies that Tybalt.\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nUp, sir, go with me.\r\nI charge thee in the Prince’s name obey.\r\n\r\n Enter Prince, attended; Montague, Capulet, their Wives and others.\r\n\r\nPRINCE.\r\nWhere are the vile beginners of this fray?\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nO noble Prince, I can discover all\r\nThe unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.\r\nThere lies the man, slain by young Romeo,\r\nThat slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nTybalt, my cousin! O my brother’s child!\r\nO Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill’d\r\nOf my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,\r\nFor blood of ours shed blood of Montague.\r\nO cousin, cousin.\r\n\r\nPRINCE.\r\nBenvolio, who began this bloody fray?\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nTybalt, here slain, whom Romeo’s hand did slay;\r\nRomeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink\r\nHow nice the quarrel was, and urg’d withal\r\nYour high displeasure. All this uttered\r\nWith gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow’d\r\nCould not take truce with the unruly spleen\r\nOf Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts\r\nWith piercing steel at bold Mercutio’s breast,\r\nWho, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,\r\nAnd, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats\r\nCold death aside, and with the other sends\r\nIt back to Tybalt, whose dexterity\r\nRetorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,\r\n‘Hold, friends! Friends, part!’ and swifter than his tongue,\r\nHis agile arm beats down their fatal points,\r\nAnd ’twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm\r\nAn envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life\r\nOf stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.\r\nBut by and by comes back to Romeo,\r\nWho had but newly entertain’d revenge,\r\nAnd to’t they go like lightning; for, ere I\r\nCould draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain;\r\nAnd as he fell did Romeo turn and fly.\r\nThis is the truth, or let Benvolio die.\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nHe is a kinsman to the Montague.\r\nAffection makes him false, he speaks not true.\r\nSome twenty of them fought in this black strife,\r\nAnd all those twenty could but kill one life.\r\nI beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give;\r\nRomeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.\r\n\r\nPRINCE.\r\nRomeo slew him, he slew Mercutio.\r\nWho now the price of his dear blood doth owe?\r\n\r\nMONTAGUE.\r\nNot Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio’s friend;\r\nHis fault concludes but what the law should end,\r\nThe life of Tybalt.\r\n\r\nPRINCE.\r\nAnd for that offence\r\nImmediately we do exile him hence.\r\nI have an interest in your hate’s proceeding,\r\nMy blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding.\r\nBut I’ll amerce you with so strong a fine\r\nThat you shall all repent the loss of mine.\r\nI will be deaf to pleading and excuses;\r\nNor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.\r\nTherefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,\r\nElse, when he is found, that hour is his last.\r\nBear hence this body, and attend our will.\r\nMercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. A Room in Capulet’s House.\r\n\r\n Enter Juliet.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nGallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,\r\nTowards Phoebus’ lodging.

Come, civil night,\r\nThou sober-suited matron, all in black,\r\nAnd learn me how to lose a winning match,\r\nPlay’d for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.\r\nHood my unmann’d blood, bating in my cheeks,\r\nWith thy black mantle, till strange love, grow bold,\r\nThink true love acted simple modesty.\r\nCome, night, come Romeo; come, thou day in night;\r\nFor thou wilt lie upon the wings of night\r\nWhiter than new snow upon a raven’s back.\r\nCome gentle night, come loving black-brow’d night,\r\nGive me my Romeo, and when I shall die,\r\nTake him and cut him out in little stars,\r\nAnd he will make the face of heaven so fine\r\nThat all the world will be in love with night,\r\nAnd pay no worship to the garish sun.\r\nO, I have bought the mansion of a love,\r\nBut not possess’d it; and though I am sold,\r\nNot yet enjoy’d.

O Romeo, Romeo.\r\nWho ever would have thought it? Romeo!\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nWhat devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?\r\nThis torture should be roar’d in dismal hell.\r\nHath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but Ay,\r\nAnd that bare vowel I shall poison more\r\nThan the death-darting eye of cockatrice.\r\nI am not I if there be such an I;\r\nOr those eyes shut that make thee answer Ay.\r\nIf he be slain, say Ay; or if not, No.\r\nBrief sounds determine of my weal or woe.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nI saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,\r\nGod save the mark!—here on his manly breast.\r\nA piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;\r\nPale, pale as ashes, all bedaub’d in blood,\r\nAll in gore-blood.

He was not born to shame.\r\nUpon his brow shame is asham’d to sit;\r\nFor ’tis a throne where honour may be crown’d\r\nSole monarch of the universal earth.\r\nO, what a beast was I to chide at him!\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nWill you speak well of him that kill’d your cousin?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nShall I speak ill of him that is my husband?\r\nAh, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,\r\nWhen I thy three-hours’ wife have mangled it?\r\nBut wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?\r\nThat villain cousin would have kill’d my husband.\r\nBack, foolish tears, back to your native spring,\r\nYour tributary drops belong to woe,\r\nWhich you mistaking offer up to joy.\r\nMy husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain,\r\nAnd Tybalt’s dead, that would have slain my husband.\r\nAll this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?\r\nSome word there was, worser than Tybalt’s death,\r\nThat murder’d me. I would forget it fain,\r\nBut O, it presses to my memory\r\nLike damned guilty deeds to sinners’ minds.\r\nTybalt is dead, and Romeo banished.\r\nThat ‘banished,’ that one word ‘banished,’\r\nHath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt’s death\r\nWas woe enough, if it had ended there.\r\nOr if sour woe delights in fellowship,\r\nAnd needly will be rank’d with other griefs,\r\nWhy follow’d not, when she said Tybalt’s dead,\r\nThy father or thy mother, nay or both,\r\nWhich modern lamentation might have mov’d?\r\nBut with a rear-ward following Tybalt’s death,\r\n‘Romeo is banished’—to speak that word\r\nIs father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,\r\nAll slain, all dead. Romeo is banished,\r\nThere is no end, no limit, measure, bound,\r\nIn that word’s death, no words can that woe sound.\r\nWhere is my father and my mother, Nurse?\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nWeeping and wailing over Tybalt’s corse.\r\nWill you go to them? I will bring you thither.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nWash they his wounds with tears. Mine shall be spent,\r\nWhen theirs are dry, for Romeo’s banishment.\r\nTake up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil’d,\r\nBoth you and I; for Romeo is exil’d.\r\nHe made you for a highway to my bed,\r\nBut I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.\r\nCome cords, come Nurse, I’ll to my wedding bed,\r\nAnd death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nHie to your chamber. I’ll find Romeo\r\nTo comfort you. I wot well where he is.\r\nHark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.\r\nI’ll to him, he is hid at Lawrence’ cell.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nO find him, give this ring to my true knight,\r\nAnd bid him come to take his last farewell.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. Friar Lawrence’s cell.\r\n\r\n Enter Friar Lawrence.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nRomeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.\r\nAffliction is enanmour’d of thy parts\r\nAnd thou art wedded to calamity.\r\n\r\n Enter Romeo.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nFather, what news? What is the Prince’s doom?\r\nWhat sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,\r\nThat I yet know not?\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nToo familiar\r\nIs my dear son with such sour company.\r\nI bring thee tidings of the Prince’s doom.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nWhat less than doomsday is the Prince’s doom?\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nA gentler judgment vanish’d from his lips,\r\nNot body’s death, but body’s banishment.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nHa, banishment? Be merciful, say death;\r\nFor exile hath more terror in his look,\r\nMuch more than death. Do not say banishment.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nHence from Verona art thou banished.\r\nBe patient, for the world is broad and wide.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nThere is no world without Verona walls,\r\nBut purgatory, torture, hell itself.\r\nHence banished is banish’d from the world,\r\nAnd world’s exile is death. Then banished\r\nIs death misterm’d. Calling death banished,\r\nThou cutt’st my head off with a golden axe,\r\nAnd smilest upon the stroke that murders me.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nO deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness!\r\nThy fault our law calls death, but the kind Prince,\r\nTaking thy part, hath brush’d aside the law,\r\nAnd turn’d that black word death to banishment.\r\nThis is dear mercy, and thou see’st it not.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\n’Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here\r\nWhere Juliet lives, and every cat and dog,\r\nAnd little mouse, every unworthy thing,\r\nLive here in heaven and may look on her,\r\nBut Romeo may not. More validity,\r\nMore honourable state, more courtship lives\r\nIn carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize\r\nOn the white wonder of dear Juliet’s hand,\r\nAnd steal immortal blessing from her lips,\r\nWho, even in pure and vestal modesty\r\nStill blush, as thinking their own kisses sin.\r\nBut Romeo may not, he is banished.\r\nThis may flies do, when I from this must fly.\r\nThey are free men but I am banished.\r\nAnd say’st thou yet that exile is not death?\r\nHadst thou no poison mix’d, no sharp-ground knife,\r\nNo sudden mean of death, though ne’er so mean,\r\nBut banished to kill me? Banished?\r\nO Friar, the damned use that word in hell.\r\nHowling attends it. How hast thou the heart,\r\nBeing a divine, a ghostly confessor,\r\nA sin-absolver, and my friend profess’d,\r\nTo mangle me with that word banished?\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nThou fond mad man, hear me speak a little,\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nO, thou wilt speak again of banishment.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nI’ll give thee armour to keep off that word,\r\nAdversity’s sweet milk, philosophy,\r\nTo comfort thee, though thou art banished.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nYet banished? Hang up philosophy.\r\nUnless philosophy can make a Juliet,\r\nDisplant a town, reverse a Prince’s doom,\r\nIt helps not, it prevails not, talk no more.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nO, then I see that mad men have no ears.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nHow should they, when that wise men have no eyes?\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nLet me dispute with thee of thy estate.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nThou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.\r\nWert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,\r\nAn hour but married, Tybalt murdered,\r\nDoting like me, and like me banished,\r\nThen mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,\r\nAnd fall upon the ground as I do now,\r\nTaking the measure of an unmade grave.\r\n\r\n [_Knocking within._]\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nArise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nNot I, unless the breath of heartsick groans\r\nMist-like infold me from the search of eyes.\r\n\r\n [_Knocking._]\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nHark, how they knock!—Who’s there?—Romeo, arise,\r\nThou wilt be taken.—Stay awhile.—Stand up.\r\n\r\n [_Knocking._]\r\n\r\nRun to my study.—By-and-by.—God’s will,\r\nWhat simpleness is this.—I come, I come.\r\n\r\n [_Knocking._]\r\n\r\nWho knocks so hard? Whence come you, what’s your will?\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\n[_Within._] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.\r\nI come from Lady Juliet.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nWelcome then.\r\n\r\n Enter Nurse.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nO holy Friar, O, tell me, holy Friar,\r\nWhere is my lady’s lord, where’s Romeo?\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nThere on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nO, he is even in my mistress’ case.\r\nJust in her case! O woeful sympathy!\r\nPiteous predicament. Even so lies she,\r\nBlubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.\r\nStand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man.\r\nFor Juliet’s sake, for her sake, rise and stand.\r\nWhy should you fall into so deep an O?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nNurse.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nAh sir, ah sir, death’s the end of all.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nSpakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?\r\nDoth not she think me an old murderer,\r\nNow I have stain’d the childhood of our joy\r\nWith blood remov’d but little from her own?\r\nWhere is she? And how doth she? And what says\r\nMy conceal’d lady to our cancell’d love?\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nO, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;\r\nAnd now falls on her bed, and then starts up,\r\nAnd Tybalt calls, and then on Romeo cries,\r\nAnd then down falls again.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nAs if that name,\r\nShot from the deadly level of a gun,\r\nDid murder her, as that name’s cursed hand\r\nMurder’d her kinsman. O, tell me, Friar, tell me,\r\nIn what vile part of this anatomy\r\nDoth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack\r\nThe hateful mansion.\r\n\r\n [_Drawing his sword._]\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nHold thy desperate hand.\r\nArt thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art.\r\nThy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote\r\nThe unreasonable fury of a beast.\r\nUnseemly woman in a seeming man,\r\nAnd ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!\r\nThou hast amaz’d me. By my holy order,\r\nI thought thy disposition better temper’d.\r\nHast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?\r\nAnd slay thy lady, that in thy life lives,\r\nBy doing damned hate upon thyself?\r\nWhy rail’st thou on thy birth, the heaven and earth?\r\nSince birth, and heaven and earth, all three do meet\r\nIn thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.\r\nFie, fie, thou sham’st thy shape, thy love, thy wit,\r\nWhich, like a usurer, abound’st in all,\r\nAnd usest none in that true use indeed\r\nWhich should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.\r\nThy noble shape is but a form of wax,\r\nDigressing from the valour of a man;\r\nThy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,\r\nKilling that love which thou hast vow’d to cherish;\r\nThy wit, that ornament to shape and love,\r\nMisshapen in the conduct of them both,\r\nLike powder in a skilless soldier’s flask,\r\nIs set afire by thine own ignorance,\r\nAnd thou dismember’d with thine own defence.\r\nWhat, rouse thee, man. Thy Juliet is alive,\r\nFor whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.\r\nThere art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,\r\nBut thou slew’st Tybalt; there art thou happy.\r\nThe law that threaten’d death becomes thy friend,\r\nAnd turns it to exile; there art thou happy.\r\nA pack of blessings light upon thy back;\r\nHappiness courts thee in her best array;\r\nBut like a misshaped and sullen wench,\r\nThou putt’st up thy Fortune and thy love.\r\nTake heed, take heed, for such die miserable.\r\nGo, get thee to thy love as was decreed,\r\nAscend her chamber, hence and comfort her.\r\nBut look thou stay not till the watch be set,\r\nFor then thou canst not pass to Mantua;\r\nWhere thou shalt live till we can find a time\r\nTo blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,\r\nBeg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back\r\nWith twenty hundred thousand times more joy\r\nThan thou went’st forth in lamentation.\r\nGo before, Nurse. Commend me to thy lady,\r\nAnd bid her hasten all the house to bed,\r\nWhich heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.\r\nRomeo is coming.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nO Lord, I could have stay’d here all the night\r\nTo hear good counsel. O, what learning is!\r\nMy lord, I’ll tell my lady you will come.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nDo so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nHere sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir.\r\nHie you, make haste, for it grows very late.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nHow well my comfort is reviv’d by this.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nGo hence, good night, and here stands all your state:\r\nEither be gone before the watch be set,\r\nOr by the break of day disguis’d from hence.\r\nSojourn in Mantua. I’ll find out your man,\r\nAnd he shall signify from time to time\r\nEvery good hap to you that chances here.\r\nGive me thy hand; ’tis late; farewell; good night.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nBut that a joy past joy calls out on me,\r\nIt were a grief so brief to part with thee.\r\nFarewell.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV. A Room in Capulet’s House.\r\n\r\n Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet and Paris.\r\n\r\nCAPULET.\r\nThings have fallen out, sir, so unluckily\r\nThat we have had no time to move our daughter.\r\nLook you, she lov’d her kinsman Tybalt dearly,\r\nAnd so did I. Well, we were born to die.\r\n’Tis very late; she’ll not come down tonight.\r\nI promise you, but for your company,\r\nI would have been abed an hour ago.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nThese times of woe afford no tune to woo.\r\nMadam, good night. Commend me to your daughter.\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nI will, and know her mind early tomorrow;\r\nTonight she’s mew’d up to her heaviness.\r\n\r\nCAPULET.\r\nSir Paris, I will make a desperate tender\r\nOf my child’s love. I think she will be rul’d\r\nIn all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.\r\nWife, go you to her ere you go to bed,\r\nAcquaint her here of my son Paris’ love,\r\nAnd bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next,\r\nBut, soft, what day is this?\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nMonday, my lord.\r\n\r\nCAPULET.\r\nMonday! Ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,\r\nA Thursday let it be; a Thursday, tell her,\r\nShe shall be married to this noble earl.\r\nWill you be ready? Do you like this haste?\r\nWe’ll keep no great ado,—a friend or two,\r\nFor, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,\r\nIt may be thought we held him carelessly,\r\nBeing our kinsman, if we revel much.\r\nTherefore we’ll have some half a dozen friends,\r\nAnd there an end. But what say you to Thursday?\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nMy lord, I would that Thursday were tomorrow.\r\n\r\nCAPULET.\r\nWell, get you gone. A Thursday be it then.\r\nGo you to Juliet ere you go to bed,\r\nPrepare her, wife, against this wedding day.\r\nFarewell, my lord.—Light to my chamber, ho!\r\nAfore me, it is so very very late that we\r\nMay call it early by and by. Good night.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE V. An open Gallery to Juliet’s Chamber, overlooking the Garden.\r\n\r\n Enter Romeo and Juliet.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nWilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.\r\nIt was the nightingale, and not the lark,\r\nThat pierc’d the fearful hollow of thine ear;\r\nNightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.\r\nBelieve me, love, it was the nightingale.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nIt was the lark, the herald of the morn,\r\nNo nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks\r\nDo lace the severing clouds in yonder east.\r\nNight’s candles are burnt out, and jocund day\r\nStands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.\r\nI must be gone and live, or stay and die.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nYond light is not daylight, I know it, I.\r\nIt is some meteor that the sun exhales\r\nTo be to thee this night a torchbearer\r\nAnd light thee on thy way to Mantua.\r\nTherefore stay yet, thou need’st not to be gone.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nLet me be ta’en, let me be put to death,\r\nI am content, so thou wilt have it so.\r\nI’ll say yon grey is not the morning’s eye,\r\n’Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia’s brow.\r\nNor that is not the lark whose notes do beat\r\nThe vaulty heaven so high above our heads.\r\nI have more care to stay than will to go.\r\nCome, death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so.\r\nHow is’t, my soul? Let’s talk. It is not day.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nIt is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away.\r\nIt is the lark that sings so out of tune,\r\nStraining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.\r\nSome say the lark makes sweet division;\r\nThis doth not so, for she divideth us.\r\nSome say the lark and loathed toad change eyes.\r\nO, now I would they had chang’d voices too,\r\nSince arm from arm that voice doth us affray,\r\nHunting thee hence with hunt’s-up to the day.\r\nO now be gone, more light and light it grows.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nMore light and light, more dark and dark our woes.\r\n\r\n Enter Nurse.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nMadam.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nNurse?\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nYour lady mother is coming to your chamber.\r\nThe day is broke, be wary, look about.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nThen, window, let day in, and let life out.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nFarewell, farewell, one kiss, and I’ll descend.\r\n\r\n [_Descends._]\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nArt thou gone so? Love, lord, ay husband, friend,\r\nI must hear from thee every day in the hour,\r\nFor in a minute there are many days.\r\nO, by this count I shall be much in years\r\nEre I again behold my Romeo.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nFarewell!\r\nI will omit no opportunity\r\nThat may convey my greetings, love, to thee.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nO thinkest thou we shall ever meet again?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nI doubt it not, and all these woes shall serve\r\nFor sweet discourses in our time to come.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nO God! I have an ill-divining soul!\r\nMethinks I see thee, now thou art so low,\r\nAs one dead in the bottom of a tomb.\r\nEither my eyesight fails, or thou look’st pale.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nAnd trust me, love, in my eye so do you.\r\nDry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu.\r\n\r\n [_Exit below._]\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nO Fortune, Fortune! All men call thee fickle,\r\nIf thou art fickle, what dost thou with him\r\nThat is renown’d for faith? Be fickle, Fortune;\r\nFor then, I hope thou wilt not keep him long\r\nBut send him back.\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\n[_Within._] Ho, daughter, are you up?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nWho is’t that calls? Is it my lady mother?\r\nIs she not down so late, or up so early?\r\nWhat unaccustom’d cause procures her hither?\r\n\r\n Enter Lady Capulet.\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nWhy, how now, Juliet?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nMadam, I am not well.\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nEvermore weeping for your cousin’s death?\r\nWhat, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?\r\nAnd if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.\r\nTherefore have done: some grief shows much of love,\r\nBut much of grief shows still some want of wit.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nYet let me weep for such a feeling loss.\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nSo shall you feel the loss, but not the friend\r\nWhich you weep for.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nFeeling so the loss,\r\nI cannot choose but ever weep the friend.\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nWell, girl, thou weep’st not so much for his death\r\nAs that the villain lives which slaughter’d him.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nWhat villain, madam?\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nThat same villain Romeo.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nVillain and he be many miles asunder.\r\nGod pardon him. I do, with all my heart.\r\nAnd yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nThat is because the traitor murderer lives.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nAy madam, from the reach of these my hands.\r\nWould none but I might venge my cousin’s death.\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nWe will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.\r\nThen weep no more. I’ll send to one in Mantua,\r\nWhere that same banish’d runagate doth live,\r\nShall give him such an unaccustom’d dram\r\nThat he shall soon keep Tybalt company:\r\nAnd then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nIndeed I never shall be satisfied\r\nWith Romeo till I behold him—dead—\r\nIs my poor heart so for a kinsman vex’d.\r\nMadam, if you could find out but a man\r\nTo bear a poison, I would temper it,\r\nThat Romeo should upon receipt thereof,\r\nSoon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors\r\nTo hear him nam’d, and cannot come to him,\r\nTo wreak the love I bore my cousin\r\nUpon his body that hath slaughter’d him.\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nFind thou the means, and I’ll find such a man.\r\nBut now I’ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nAnd joy comes well in such a needy time.\r\nWhat are they, I beseech your ladyship?\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nWell, well, thou hast a careful father, child;\r\nOne who to put thee from thy heaviness,\r\nHath sorted out a sudden day of joy,\r\nThat thou expects not, nor I look’d not for.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nMadam, in happy time, what day is that?\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nMarry, my child, early next Thursday morn\r\nThe gallant, young, and noble gentleman,\r\nThe County Paris, at Saint Peter’s Church,\r\nShall happily make thee there a joyful bride.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nNow by Saint Peter’s Church, and Peter too,\r\nHe shall not make me there a joyful bride.\r\nI wonder at this haste, that I must wed\r\nEre he that should be husband comes to woo.\r\nI pray you tell my lord and father, madam,\r\nI will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear\r\nIt shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,\r\nRather than Paris. These are news indeed.\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nHere comes your father, tell him so yourself,\r\nAnd see how he will take it at your hands.\r\n\r\n Enter Capulet and Nurse.\r\n\r\nCAPULET.\r\nWhen the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;\r\nBut for the sunset of my brother’s son\r\nIt rains downright.\r\nHow now? A conduit, girl? What, still in tears?\r\nEvermore showering? In one little body\r\nThou counterfeits a bark, a sea, a wind.\r\nFor still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,\r\nDo ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,\r\nSailing in this salt flood, the winds, thy sighs,\r\nWho raging with thy tears and they with them,\r\nWithout a sudden calm will overset\r\nThy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?\r\nHave you deliver’d to her our decree?\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nAy, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.\r\nI would the fool were married to her grave.\r\n\r\nCAPULET.\r\nSoft. Take me with you, take me with you, wife.\r\nHow, will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?\r\nIs she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,\r\nUnworthy as she is, that we have wrought\r\nSo worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nNot proud you have, but thankful that you have.\r\nProud can I never be of what I hate;\r\nBut thankful even for hate that is meant love.\r\n\r\nCAPULET.\r\nHow now, how now, chopp’d logic? What is this?\r\nProud, and, I thank you, and I thank you not;\r\nAnd yet not proud. Mistress minion you,\r\nThank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,\r\nBut fettle your fine joints ’gainst Thursday next\r\nTo go with Paris to Saint Peter’s Church,\r\nOr I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.\r\nOut, you green-sickness carrion! Out, you baggage!\r\nYou tallow-face!\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nFie, fie!

The time is very short.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nMy father Capulet will have it so;\r\nAnd I am nothing slow to slack his haste.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nYou say you do not know the lady’s mind.\r\nUneven is the course; I like it not.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nImmoderately she weeps for Tybalt’s death,\r\nAnd therefore have I little talk’d of love;\r\nFor Venus smiles not in a house of tears.\r\nNow, sir, her father counts it dangerous\r\nThat she do give her sorrow so much sway;\r\nAnd in his wisdom, hastes our marriage,\r\nTo stop the inundation of her tears,\r\nWhich, too much minded by herself alone,\r\nMay be put from her by society.\r\nNow do you know the reason of this haste.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\n[_Aside._] I would I knew not why it should be slow’d.—\r\nLook, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.\r\n\r\n Enter Juliet.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nHappily met, my lady and my wife!\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nThat may be, sir, when I may be a wife.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nThat may be, must be, love, on Thursday next.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nWhat must be shall be.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nThat’s a certain text.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nCome you to make confession to this father?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nTo answer that, I should confess to you.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nDo not deny to him that you love me.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nI will confess to you that I love him.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nSo will ye, I am sure, that you love me.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nIf I do so, it will be of more price,\r\nBeing spoke behind your back than to your face.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nPoor soul, thy face is much abus’d with tears.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nThe tears have got small victory by that;\r\nFor it was bad enough before their spite.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nThou wrong’st it more than tears with that report.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nThat is no slander, sir, which is a truth,\r\nAnd what I spake, I spake it to my face.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nThy face is mine, and thou hast slander’d it.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nIt may be so, for it is not mine own.\r\nAre you at leisure, holy father, now,\r\nOr shall I come to you at evening mass?\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nMy leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.—\r\nMy lord, we must entreat the time alone.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nGod shield I should disturb devotion!—\r\nJuliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye,\r\nTill then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nO shut the door, and when thou hast done so,\r\nCome weep with me, past hope, past cure, past help!\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nO Juliet, I already know thy grief;\r\nIt strains me past the compass of my wits.\r\nI hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,\r\nOn Thursday next be married to this County.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nTell me not, Friar, that thou hear’st of this,\r\nUnless thou tell me how I may prevent it.\r\nIf in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,\r\nDo thou but call my resolution wise,\r\nAnd with this knife I’ll help it presently.\r\nGod join’d my heart and Romeo’s, thou our hands;\r\nAnd ere this hand, by thee to Romeo’s seal’d,\r\nShall be the label to another deed,\r\nOr my true heart with treacherous revolt\r\nTurn to another, this shall slay them both.\r\nTherefore, out of thy long-experienc’d time,\r\nGive me some present counsel, or behold\r\n’Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife\r\nShall play the empire, arbitrating that\r\nWhich the commission of thy years and art\r\nCould to no issue of true honour bring.\r\nBe not so long to speak. I long to die,\r\nIf what thou speak’st speak not of remedy.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nHold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,\r\nWhich craves as desperate an execution\r\nAs that is desperate which we would prevent.\r\nIf, rather than to marry County Paris\r\nThou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,\r\nThen is it likely thou wilt undertake\r\nA thing like death to chide away this shame,\r\nThat cop’st with death himself to scape from it.\r\nAnd if thou dar’st, I’ll give thee remedy.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nO, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,\r\nFrom off the battlements of yonder tower,\r\nOr walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk\r\nWhere serpents are. Chain me with roaring bears;\r\nOr hide me nightly in a charnel-house,\r\nO’er-cover’d quite with dead men’s rattling bones,\r\nWith reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls.\r\nOr bid me go into a new-made grave,\r\nAnd hide me with a dead man in his shroud;\r\nThings that, to hear them told, have made me tremble,\r\nAnd I will do it without fear or doubt,\r\nTo live an unstain’d wife to my sweet love.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nHold then. Go home, be merry, give consent\r\nTo marry Paris. Wednesday is tomorrow;\r\nTomorrow night look that thou lie alone,\r\nLet not thy Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.\r\nTake thou this vial, being then in bed,\r\nAnd this distilled liquor drink thou off,\r\nWhen presently through all thy veins shall run\r\nA cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse\r\nShall keep his native progress, but surcease.\r\nNo warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest,\r\nThe roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade\r\nTo paly ashes; thy eyes’ windows fall,\r\nLike death when he shuts up the day of life.\r\nEach part depriv’d of supple government,\r\nShall stiff and stark and cold appear like death.\r\nAnd in this borrow’d likeness of shrunk death\r\nThou shalt continue two and forty hours,\r\nAnd then awake as from a pleasant sleep.\r\nNow when the bridegroom in the morning comes\r\nTo rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.\r\nThen as the manner of our country is,\r\nIn thy best robes, uncover’d, on the bier,\r\nThou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault\r\nWhere all the kindred of the Capulets lie.\r\nIn the meantime, against thou shalt awake,\r\nShall Romeo by my letters know our drift,\r\nAnd hither shall he come, and he and I\r\nWill watch thy waking, and that very night\r\nShall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.\r\nAnd this shall free thee from this present shame,\r\nIf no inconstant toy nor womanish fear\r\nAbate thy valour in the acting it.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nGive me, give me! O tell not me of fear!\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nHold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous\r\nIn this resolve. I’ll send a friar with speed\r\nTo Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nLove give me strength, and strength shall help afford.\r\nFarewell, dear father.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II.

Where have you been gadding?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nWhere I have learnt me to repent the sin\r\nOf disobedient opposition\r\nTo you and your behests; and am enjoin’d\r\nBy holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here,\r\nTo beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you.\r\nHenceforward I am ever rul’d by you.\r\n\r\nCAPULET.\r\nSend for the County, go tell him of this.\r\nI’ll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nI met the youthful lord at Lawrence’ cell,\r\nAnd gave him what becomed love I might,\r\nNot stepping o’er the bounds of modesty.\r\n\r\nCAPULET.\r\nWhy, I am glad on’t. This is well. Stand up.\r\nThis is as’t should be. Let me see the County.\r\nAy, marry. Go, I say, and fetch him hither.\r\nNow afore God, this reverend holy Friar,\r\nAll our whole city is much bound to him.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nNurse, will you go with me into my closet,\r\nTo help me sort such needful ornaments\r\nAs you think fit to furnish me tomorrow?\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nNo, not till Thursday.

There’s a fearful point!\r\nShall I not then be stifled in the vault,\r\nTo whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,\r\nAnd there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?\r\nOr, if I live, is it not very like,\r\nThe horrible conceit of death and night,\r\nTogether with the terror of the place,\r\nAs in a vault, an ancient receptacle,\r\nWhere for this many hundred years the bones\r\nOf all my buried ancestors are pack’d,\r\nWhere bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,\r\nLies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,\r\nAt some hours in the night spirits resort—\r\nAlack, alack, is it not like that I,\r\nSo early waking, what with loathsome smells,\r\nAnd shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,\r\nThat living mortals, hearing them, run mad.\r\nO, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,\r\nEnvironed with all these hideous fears,\r\nAnd madly play with my forefathers’ joints?\r\nAnd pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?\r\nAnd, in this rage, with some great kinsman’s bone,\r\nAs with a club, dash out my desperate brains?\r\nO look, methinks I see my cousin’s ghost\r\nSeeking out Romeo that did spit his body\r\nUpon a rapier’s point.

Heaven and yourself\r\nHad part in this fair maid, now heaven hath all,\r\nAnd all the better is it for the maid.\r\nYour part in her you could not keep from death,\r\nBut heaven keeps his part in eternal life.\r\nThe most you sought was her promotion,\r\nFor ’twas your heaven she should be advanc’d,\r\nAnd weep ye now, seeing she is advanc’d\r\nAbove the clouds, as high as heaven itself?\r\nO, in this love, you love your child so ill\r\nThat you run mad, seeing that she is well.\r\nShe’s not well married that lives married long,\r\nBut she’s best married that dies married young.\r\nDry up your tears, and stick your rosemary\r\nOn this fair corse, and, as the custom is,\r\nAnd in her best array bear her to church;\r\nFor though fond nature bids us all lament,\r\nYet nature’s tears are reason’s merriment.\r\n\r\nCAPULET.\r\nAll things that we ordained festival\r\nTurn from their office to black funeral:\r\nOur instruments to melancholy bells,\r\nOur wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;\r\nOur solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;\r\nOur bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,\r\nAnd all things change them to the contrary.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nSir, go you in, and, madam, go with him,\r\nAnd go, Sir Paris, everyone prepare\r\nTo follow this fair corse unto her grave.\r\nThe heavens do lower upon you for some ill;\r\nMove them no more by crossing their high will.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Capulet, Lady Capulet, Paris and Friar._]\r\n\r\nFIRST MUSICIAN.\r\nFaith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nHonest good fellows, ah, put up, put up,\r\nFor well you know this is a pitiful case.\r\n\r\nFIRST MUSICIAN.\r\nAy, by my troth, the case may be amended.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Nurse._]\r\n\r\n Enter Peter.\r\n\r\nPETER.\r\nMusicians, O, musicians, ‘Heart’s ease,’ ‘Heart’s ease’, O, and you\r\nwill have me live, play ‘Heart’s ease.’\r\n\r\nFIRST MUSICIAN.\r\nWhy ‘Heart’s ease’?\r\n\r\nPETER.\r\nO musicians, because my heart itself plays ‘My heart is full’. O play\r\nme some merry dump to comfort me.\r\n\r\nFIRST MUSICIAN.\r\nNot a dump we, ’tis no time to play now.\r\n\r\nPETER.\r\nYou will not then?\r\n\r\nFIRST MUSICIAN.\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nPETER.\r\nI will then give it you soundly.\r\n\r\nFIRST MUSICIAN.\r\nWhat will you give us?\r\n\r\nPETER.\r\nNo money, on my faith, but the gleek! I will give you the minstrel.\r\n\r\nFIRST MUSICIAN.\r\nThen will I give you the serving-creature.\r\n\r\nPETER.\r\nThen will I lay the serving-creature’s dagger on your pate. I will\r\ncarry no crotchets. I’ll re you, I’ll fa you. Do you note me?\r\n\r\nFIRST MUSICIAN.\r\nAnd you re us and fa us, you note us.\r\n\r\nSECOND MUSICIAN.\r\nPray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit.\r\n\r\nPETER.\r\nThen have at you with my wit. I will dry-beat you with an iron wit, and\r\nput up my iron dagger. Answer me like men.\r\n ‘When griping griefs the heart doth wound,\r\n And doleful dumps the mind oppress,\r\n Then music with her silver sound’—\r\nWhy ‘silver sound’? Why ‘music with her silver sound’? What say you,\r\nSimon Catling?\r\n\r\nFIRST MUSICIAN.\r\nMarry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.\r\n\r\nPETER.\r\nPrates. What say you, Hugh Rebeck?\r\n\r\nSECOND MUSICIAN.\r\nI say ‘silver sound’ because musicians sound for silver.\r\n\r\nPETER.\r\nPrates too! What say you, James Soundpost?\r\n\r\nTHIRD MUSICIAN.\r\nFaith, I know not what to say.\r\n\r\nPETER.\r\nO, I cry you mercy, you are the singer. I will say for you. It is\r\n‘music with her silver sound’ because musicians have no gold for\r\nsounding.\r\n ‘Then music with her silver sound\r\n With speedy help doth lend redress.’\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nFIRST MUSICIAN.\r\nWhat a pestilent knave is this same!\r\n\r\nSECOND MUSICIAN.\r\nHang him, Jack.

A Street.\r\n\n Enter Romeo.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nIf I may trust the flattering eye of sleep,\r\nMy dreams presage some joyful news at hand.\r\nMy bosom’s lord sits lightly in his throne;\r\nAnd all this day an unaccustom’d spirit\r\nLifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.\r\nI dreamt my lady came and found me dead,—\r\nStrange dream, that gives a dead man leave to think!—\r\nAnd breath’d such life with kisses in my lips,\r\nThat I reviv’d, and was an emperor.\r\nAh me, how sweet is love itself possess’d,\r\nWhen but love’s shadows are so rich in joy.\r\n\r\n Enter Balthasar.\r\n\r\nNews from Verona! How now, Balthasar?\r\nDost thou not bring me letters from the Friar?\r\nHow doth my lady? Is my father well?\r\nHow fares my Juliet? That I ask again;\r\nFor nothing can be ill if she be well.\r\n\r\nBALTHASAR.\r\nThen she is well, and nothing can be ill.\r\nHer body sleeps in Capel’s monument,\r\nAnd her immortal part with angels lives.\r\nI saw her laid low in her kindred’s vault,\r\nAnd presently took post to tell it you.\r\nO pardon me for bringing these ill news,\r\nSince you did leave it for my office, sir.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nIs it even so? Then I defy you, stars!\r\nThou know’st my lodging. Get me ink and paper,\r\nAnd hire post-horses. I will hence tonight.\r\n\r\nBALTHASAR.\r\nI do beseech you sir, have patience.\r\nYour looks are pale and wild, and do import\r\nSome misadventure.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nTush, thou art deceiv’d.\r\nLeave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.\r\nHast thou no letters to me from the Friar?\r\n\r\nBALTHASAR.\r\nNo, my good lord.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nNo matter. Get thee gone,\r\nAnd hire those horses. I’ll be with thee straight.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Balthasar._]\r\n\r\nWell, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight.\r\nLet’s see for means. O mischief thou art swift\r\nTo enter in the thoughts of desperate men.\r\nI do remember an apothecary,—\r\nAnd hereabouts he dwells,—which late I noted\r\nIn tatter’d weeds, with overwhelming brows,\r\nCulling of simples, meagre were his looks,\r\nSharp misery had worn him to the bones;\r\nAnd in his needy shop a tortoise hung,\r\nAn alligator stuff’d, and other skins\r\nOf ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves\r\nA beggarly account of empty boxes,\r\nGreen earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,\r\nRemnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses\r\nWere thinly scatter’d, to make up a show.\r\nNoting this penury, to myself I said,\r\nAnd if a man did need a poison now,\r\nWhose sale is present death in Mantua,\r\nHere lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.\r\nO, this same thought did but forerun my need,\r\nAnd this same needy man must sell it me.\r\nAs I remember, this should be the house.\r\nBeing holiday, the beggar’s shop is shut.\r\nWhat, ho! Apothecary!\r\n\r\n Enter Apothecary.\r\n\r\nAPOTHECARY.\r\nWho calls so loud?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nCome hither, man. I see that thou art poor.\r\nHold, there is forty ducats. Let me have\r\nA dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear\r\nAs will disperse itself through all the veins,\r\nThat the life-weary taker may fall dead,\r\nAnd that the trunk may be discharg’d of breath\r\nAs violently as hasty powder fir’d\r\nDoth hurry from the fatal cannon’s womb.\r\n\r\nAPOTHECARY.\r\nSuch mortal drugs I have, but Mantua’s law\r\nIs death to any he that utters them.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nArt thou so bare and full of wretchedness,\r\nAnd fear’st to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,\r\nNeed and oppression starveth in thine eyes,\r\nContempt and beggary hangs upon thy back.\r\nThe world is not thy friend, nor the world’s law;\r\nThe world affords no law to make thee rich;\r\nThen be not poor, but break it and take this.\r\n\r\nAPOTHECARY.\r\nMy poverty, but not my will consents.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nI pay thy poverty, and not thy will.\r\n\r\nAPOTHECARY.\r\nPut this in any liquid thing you will\r\nAnd drink it off; and, if you had the strength\r\nOf twenty men, it would despatch you straight.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nThere is thy gold, worse poison to men’s souls,\r\nDoing more murder in this loathsome world\r\nThan these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.\r\nI sell thee poison, thou hast sold me none.\r\nFarewell, buy food, and get thyself in flesh.\r\nCome, cordial and not poison, go with me\r\nTo Juliet’s grave, for there must I use thee.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II.

What says Romeo?\r\nOr, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.\r\n\r\nFRIAR JOHN.\r\nGoing to find a barefoot brother out,\r\nOne of our order, to associate me,\r\nHere in this city visiting the sick,\r\nAnd finding him, the searchers of the town,\r\nSuspecting that we both were in a house\r\nWhere the infectious pestilence did reign,\r\nSeal’d up the doors, and would not let us forth,\r\nSo that my speed to Mantua there was stay’d.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nWho bare my letter then to Romeo?\r\n\r\nFRIAR JOHN.\r\nI could not send it,—here it is again,—\r\nNor get a messenger to bring it thee,\r\nSo fearful were they of infection.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nUnhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,\r\nThe letter was not nice, but full of charge,\r\nOf dear import, and the neglecting it\r\nMay do much danger. Friar John, go hence,\r\nGet me an iron crow and bring it straight\r\nUnto my cell.\r\n\r\nFRIAR JOHN.\r\nBrother, I’ll go and bring it thee.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nNow must I to the monument alone.\r\nWithin this three hours will fair Juliet wake.\r\nShe will beshrew me much that Romeo\r\nHath had no notice of these accidents;\r\nBut I will write again to Mantua,\r\nAnd keep her at my cell till Romeo come.\r\nPoor living corse, clos’d in a dead man’s tomb.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III.

Hence and stand aloof.\r\nYet put it out, for I would not be seen.\r\nUnder yond yew tree lay thee all along,\r\nHolding thy ear close to the hollow ground;\r\nSo shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,\r\nBeing loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,\r\nBut thou shalt hear it.

Muffle me, night, awhile.\r\n\r\n [_Retires._]\r\n\r\n Enter Romeo and Balthasar with a torch, mattock, &c.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nGive me that mattock and the wrenching iron.\r\nHold, take this letter; early in the morning\r\nSee thou deliver it to my lord and father.\r\nGive me the light; upon thy life I charge thee,\r\nWhate’er thou hear’st or seest, stand all aloof\r\nAnd do not interrupt me in my course.\r\nWhy I descend into this bed of death\r\nIs partly to behold my lady’s face,\r\nBut chiefly to take thence from her dead finger\r\nA precious ring, a ring that I must use\r\nIn dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.\r\nBut if thou jealous dost return to pry\r\nIn what I further shall intend to do,\r\nBy heaven I will tear thee joint by joint,\r\nAnd strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.\r\nThe time and my intents are savage-wild;\r\nMore fierce and more inexorable far\r\nThan empty tigers or the roaring sea.\r\n\r\nBALTHASAR.\r\nI will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nSo shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.\r\nLive, and be prosperous, and farewell, good fellow.\r\n\r\nBALTHASAR.\r\nFor all this same, I’ll hide me hereabout.\r\nHis looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.\r\n\r\n [_Retires_]\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nThou detestable maw, thou womb of death,\r\nGorg’d with the dearest morsel of the earth,\r\nThus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,\r\n\r\n [_Breaking open the door of the monument._]\r\n\r\nAnd in despite, I’ll cram thee with more food.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nThis is that banish’d haughty Montague\r\nThat murder’d my love’s cousin,—with which grief,\r\nIt is supposed, the fair creature died,—\r\nAnd here is come to do some villainous shame\r\nTo the dead bodies.

Think upon these gone;\r\nLet them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,\r\nPut not another sin upon my head\r\nBy urging me to fury. O be gone.\r\nBy heaven I love thee better than myself;\r\nFor I come hither arm’d against myself.\r\nStay not, be gone, live, and hereafter say,\r\nA madman’s mercy bid thee run away.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nI do defy thy conjuration,\r\nAnd apprehend thee for a felon here.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nWilt thou provoke me?

Let me peruse this face.\r\nMercutio’s kinsman, noble County Paris!\r\nWhat said my man, when my betossed soul\r\nDid not attend him as we rode? I think\r\nHe told me Paris should have married Juliet.\r\nSaid he not so? Or did I dream it so?\r\nOr am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,\r\nTo think it was so? O, give me thy hand,\r\nOne writ with me in sour misfortune’s book.\r\nI’ll bury thee in a triumphant grave.\r\nA grave? O no, a lantern, slaught’red youth,\r\nFor here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes\r\nThis vault a feasting presence full of light.\r\nDeath, lie thou there, by a dead man interr’d.\r\n\r\n [_Laying Paris in the monument._]\r\n\r\nHow oft when men are at the point of death\r\nHave they been merry! Which their keepers call\r\nA lightning before death. O, how may I\r\nCall this a lightning? O my love, my wife,\r\nDeath that hath suck’d the honey of thy breath,\r\nHath had no power yet upon thy beauty.\r\nThou art not conquer’d. Beauty’s ensign yet\r\nIs crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,\r\nAnd death’s pale flag is not advanced there.\r\nTybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?\r\nO, what more favour can I do to thee\r\nThan with that hand that cut thy youth in twain\r\nTo sunder his that was thine enemy?\r\nForgive me, cousin. Ah, dear Juliet,\r\nWhy art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe\r\nThat unsubstantial death is amorous;\r\nAnd that the lean abhorred monster keeps\r\nThee here in dark to be his paramour?\r\nFor fear of that I still will stay with thee,\r\nAnd never from this palace of dim night\r\nDepart again. Here, here will I remain\r\nWith worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here\r\nWill I set up my everlasting rest;\r\nAnd shake the yoke of inauspicious stars\r\nFrom this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last.\r\nArms, take your last embrace! And, lips, O you\r\nThe doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss\r\nA dateless bargain to engrossing death.\r\nCome, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide.\r\nThou desperate pilot, now at once run on\r\nThe dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark.\r\nHere’s to my love! [_Drinks._] O true apothecary!\r\nThy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.\r\n\r\n [_Dies._]\r\n\r\n Enter, at the other end of the Churchyard, Friar Lawrence, with a\r\n lantern, crow, and spade.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nSaint Francis be my speed. How oft tonight\r\nHave my old feet stumbled at graves? Who’s there?\r\nWho is it that consorts, so late, the dead?\r\n\r\nBALTHASAR.\r\nHere’s one, a friend, and one that knows you well.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nBliss be upon you. Tell me, good my friend,\r\nWhat torch is yond that vainly lends his light\r\nTo grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,\r\nIt burneth in the Capels’ monument.\r\n\r\nBALTHASAR.\r\nIt doth so, holy sir, and there’s my master,\r\nOne that you love.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nWho is it?\r\n\r\nBALTHASAR.\r\nRomeo.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nHow long hath he been there?\r\n\r\nBALTHASAR.\r\nFull half an hour.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nGo with me to the vault.\r\n\r\nBALTHASAR.\r\nI dare not, sir;\r\nMy master knows not but I am gone hence,\r\nAnd fearfully did menace me with death\r\nIf I did stay to look on his intents.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nStay then, I’ll go alone. Fear comes upon me.\r\nO, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.\r\n\r\nBALTHASAR.\r\nAs I did sleep under this yew tree here,\r\nI dreamt my master and another fought,\r\nAnd that my master slew him.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nRomeo!

Lady, come from that nest\r\nOf death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.\r\nA greater power than we can contradict\r\nHath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.\r\nThy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;\r\nAnd Paris too. Come, I’ll dispose of thee\r\nAmong a sisterhood of holy nuns.\r\nStay not to question, for the watch is coming.\r\nCome, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nGo, get thee hence, for I will not away.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Friar Lawrence._]\r\n\r\nWhat’s here?

Meantime forbear,\r\nAnd let mischance be slave to patience.\r\nBring forth the parties of suspicion.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nI am the greatest, able to do least,\r\nYet most suspected, as the time and place\r\nDoth make against me, of this direful murder.\r\nAnd here I stand, both to impeach and purge\r\nMyself condemned and myself excus’d.\r\n\r\nPRINCE.\r\nThen say at once what thou dost know in this.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nI will be brief, for my short date of breath\r\nIs not so long as is a tedious tale.\r\nRomeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,\r\nAnd she, there dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife.\r\nI married them; and their stol’n marriage day\r\nWas Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely death\r\nBanish’d the new-made bridegroom from this city;\r\nFor whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin’d.\r\nYou, to remove that siege of grief from her,\r\nBetroth’d, and would have married her perforce\r\nTo County Paris. Then comes she to me,\r\nAnd with wild looks, bid me devise some means\r\nTo rid her from this second marriage,\r\nOr in my cell there would she kill herself.\r\nThen gave I her, so tutored by my art,\r\nA sleeping potion, which so took effect\r\nAs I intended, for it wrought on her\r\nThe form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo\r\nThat he should hither come as this dire night\r\nTo help to take her from her borrow’d grave,\r\nBeing the time the potion’s force should cease.\r\nBut he which bore my letter, Friar John,\r\nWas stay’d by accident; and yesternight\r\nReturn’d my letter back. Then all alone\r\nAt the prefixed hour of her waking\r\nCame I to take her from her kindred’s vault,\r\nMeaning to keep her closely at my cell\r\nTill I conveniently could send to Romeo.\r\nBut when I came, some minute ere the time\r\nOf her awaking, here untimely lay\r\nThe noble Paris and true Romeo dead.\r\nShe wakes; and I entreated her come forth\r\nAnd bear this work of heaven with patience.\r\nBut then a noise did scare me from the tomb;\r\nAnd she, too desperate, would not go with me,\r\nBut, as it seems, did violence on herself.\r\nAll this I know; and to the marriage\r\nHer Nurse is privy. And if ought in this\r\nMiscarried by my fault, let my old life\r\nBe sacrific’d, some hour before his time,\r\nUnto the rigour of severest law.\r\n\r\nPRINCE.\r\nWe still have known thee for a holy man.\r\nWhere’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this?\r\n\r\nBALTHASAR.\r\nI brought my master news of Juliet’s death,\r\nAnd then in post he came from Mantua\r\nTo this same place, to this same monument.\r\nThis letter he early bid me give his father,\r\nAnd threaten’d me with death, going in the vault,\r\nIf I departed not, and left him there.\r\n\r\nPRINCE.\r\nGive me the letter, I will look on it.\r\nWhere is the County’s Page that rais’d the watch?\r\nSirrah, what made your master in this place?\r\n\r\nPAGE.\r\nHe came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave,\r\nAnd bid me stand aloof, and so I did.\r\nAnon comes one with light to ope the tomb,\r\nAnd by and by my master drew on him,\r\nAnd then I ran away to call the watch.\r\n\r\nPRINCE.\r\nThis letter doth make good the Friar’s words,\r\nTheir course of love, the tidings of her death.\r\nAnd here he writes that he did buy a poison\r\nOf a poor ’pothecary, and therewithal\r\nCame to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.\r\nWhere be these enemies? Capulet, Montague,\r\nSee what a scourge is laid upon your hate,\r\nThat heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!\r\nAnd I, for winking at your discords too,\r\nHave lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish’d.\r\n\r\nCAPULET.\r\nO brother Montague, give me thy hand.\r\nThis is my daughter’s jointure, for no more\r\nCan I demand.\r\n\r\nMONTAGUE.\r\nBut I can give thee more,\r\nFor I will raise her statue in pure gold,\r\nThat whiles Verona by that name is known,\r\nThere shall no figure at such rate be set\r\nAs that of true and faithful Juliet.\r\n\r\nCAPULET.\r\nAs rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie,\r\nPoor sacrifices of our enmity.\r\n\r\nPRINCE.\r\nA glooming peace this morning with it brings;\r\nThe sun for sorrow will not show his head.\r\nGo hence, to have more talk of these sad things.\r\nSome shall be pardon’d, and some punished,\r\nFor never was a story of more woe\r\nThan this of Juliet and her Romeo.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\nTHE TAMING OF THE SHREW\r\n\nContents\r\n\r\nINDUCTION\r\n Scene I.

I ne’er drank\r\nsack in my life; and if you give me any conserves, give me conserves of\r\nbeef. Ne’er ask me what raiment I’ll wear, for I have no more doublets\r\nthan backs, no more stockings than legs, nor no more shoes than feet:\r\nnay, sometime more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my toes look\r\nthrough the over-leather.\r\n\r\nLORD.\r\nHeaven cease this idle humour in your honour!\r\nO, that a mighty man of such descent,\r\nOf such possessions, and so high esteem,\r\nShould be infused with so foul a spirit!\r\n\r\nSLY.\r\nWhat! would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher Sly, old Sly’s son of\r\nBurton-heath; by birth a pedlar, by education a cardmaker, by\r\ntransmutation a bear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker?

How mean you that? No mates for you,\r\nUnless you were of gentler, milder mould.\r\n\r\nKATHERINA.\r\nI’ faith, sir, you shall never need to fear;\r\nI wis it is not half way to her heart;\r\nBut if it were, doubt not her care should be\r\nTo comb your noddle with a three-legg’d stool,\r\nAnd paint your face, and use you like a fool.\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\nFrom all such devils, good Lord deliver us!\r\n\r\nGREMIO.\r\nAnd me, too, good Lord!\r\n\r\nTRANIO.\r\nHusht, master! Here’s some good pastime toward:\r\nThat wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.\r\n\r\nLUCENTIO.\r\nBut in the other’s silence do I see\r\nMaid’s mild behaviour and sobriety.\r\nPeace, Tranio!\r\n\r\nTRANIO.\r\nWell said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.\r\n\r\nBAPTISTA.\r\nGentlemen, that I may soon make good\r\nWhat I have said,—Bianca, get you in:\r\nAnd let it not displease thee, good Bianca,\r\nFor I will love thee ne’er the less, my girl.\r\n\r\nKATHERINA.\r\nA pretty peat! it is best put finger in the eye, and she knew why.\r\n\r\nBIANCA.\r\nSister, content you in my discontent.\r\nSir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe:\r\nMy books and instruments shall be my company,\r\nOn them to look, and practise by myself.\r\n\r\nLUCENTIO.\r\nHark, Tranio! thou mayst hear Minerva speak.\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\nSignior Baptista, will you be so strange?\r\nSorry am I that our good will effects\r\nBianca’s grief.\r\n\r\nGREMIO.\r\nWhy will you mew her up,\r\nSignior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,\r\nAnd make her bear the penance of her tongue?\r\n\r\nBAPTISTA.\r\nGentlemen, content ye; I am resolv’d.\r\nGo in, Bianca.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Bianca._]\r\n\r\nAnd for I know she taketh most delight\r\nIn music, instruments, and poetry,\r\nSchoolmasters will I keep within my house\r\nFit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,\r\nOr, Signior Gremio, you, know any such,\r\nPrefer them hither; for to cunning men\r\nI will be very kind, and liberal\r\nTo mine own children in good bringing up;\r\nAnd so, farewell. Katherina, you may stay;\r\nFor I have more to commune with Bianca.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nKATHERINA.\r\nWhy, and I trust I may go too, may I not? What! shall I be appointed\r\nhours, as though, belike, I knew not what to take and what to leave?\r\nHa!\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nGREMIO.\r\nYou may go to the devil’s dam: your gifts are so good here’s none will\r\nhold you. Their love is not so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our\r\nnails together, and fast it fairly out; our cake’s dough on both sides.\r\nFarewell: yet, for the love I bear my sweet Bianca, if I can by any\r\nmeans light on a fit man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will\r\nwish him to her father.\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\nSo will I, Signior Gremio: but a word, I pray. Though the nature of our\r\nquarrel yet never brooked parle, know now, upon advice, it toucheth us\r\nboth,—that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress, and be\r\nhappy rivals in Bianca’s love,—to labour and effect one thing\r\nspecially.\r\n\r\nGREMIO.\r\nWhat’s that, I pray?\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\nMarry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.\r\n\r\nGREMIO.\r\nA husband! a devil.\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\nI say, a husband.\r\n\r\nGREMIO.\r\nI say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Hortensio, though her father be very\r\nrich, any man is so very a fool to be married to hell?\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\nTush, Gremio! Though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud\r\nalarums, why, man, there be good fellows in the world, and a man could\r\nlight on them, would take her with all faults, and money enough.\r\n\r\nGREMIO.\r\nI cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with this condition: to\r\nbe whipp’d at the high cross every morning.\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\nFaith, as you say, there’s small choice in rotten apples. But come;\r\nsince this bar in law makes us friends, it shall be so far forth\r\nfriendly maintained, till by helping Baptista’s eldest daughter to a\r\nhusband, we set his youngest free for a husband, and then have to’t\r\nafresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man be his dole! He that runs fastest gets\r\nthe ring. How say you, Signior Gremio?\r\n\r\nGREMIO.\r\nI am agreed; and would I had given him the best horse in Padua to begin\r\nhis wooing, that would thoroughly woo her, wed her, and bed her, and\r\nrid the house of her. Come on.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Gremio and Hortensio._]\r\n\r\nTRANIO.\r\nI pray, sir, tell me, is it possible\r\nThat love should of a sudden take such hold?\r\n\r\nLUCENTIO.\r\nO Tranio! till I found it to be true,\r\nI never thought it possible or likely;\r\nBut see, while idly I stood looking on,\r\nI found the effect of love in idleness;\r\nAnd now in plainness do confess to thee,\r\nThat art to me as secret and as dear\r\nAs Anna to the Queen of Carthage was,\r\nTranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,\r\nIf I achieve not this young modest girl.\r\nCounsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst:\r\nAssist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.\r\n\r\nTRANIO.\r\nMaster, it is no time to chide you now;\r\nAffection is not rated from the heart:\r\nIf love have touch’d you, nought remains but so:\r\n_Redime te captum quam queas minimo._\r\n\r\nLUCENTIO.\r\nGramercies, lad; go forward; this contents;\r\nThe rest will comfort, for thy counsel’s sound.\r\n\r\nTRANIO.\r\nMaster, you look’d so longly on the maid.\r\nPerhaps you mark’d not what’s the pith of all.\r\n\r\nLUCENTIO.\r\nO, yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,\r\nSuch as the daughter of Agenor had,\r\nThat made great Jove to humble him to her hand,\r\nWhen with his knees he kiss’d the Cretan strand.\r\n\r\nTRANIO.\r\nSaw you no more? mark’d you not how her sister\r\nBegan to scold and raise up such a storm\r\nThat mortal ears might hardly endure the din?\r\n\r\nLUCENTIO.\r\nTranio, I saw her coral lips to move,\r\nAnd with her breath she did perfume the air;\r\nSacred and sweet was all I saw in her.\r\n\r\nTRANIO.\r\nNay, then, ’tis time to stir him from his trance.\r\nI pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid,\r\nBend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:\r\nHer elder sister is so curst and shrewd,\r\nThat till the father rid his hands of her,\r\nMaster, your love must live a maid at home;\r\nAnd therefore has he closely mew’d her up,\r\nBecause she will not be annoy’d with suitors.\r\n\r\nLUCENTIO.\r\nAh, Tranio, what a cruel father’s he!\r\nBut art thou not advis’d he took some care\r\nTo get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?\r\n\r\nTRANIO.\r\nAy, marry, am I, sir, and now ’tis plotted.\r\n\r\nLUCENTIO.\r\nI have it, Tranio.\r\n\r\nTRANIO.\r\nMaster, for my hand,\r\nBoth our inventions meet and jump in one.\r\n\r\nLUCENTIO.\r\nTell me thine first.\r\n\r\nTRANIO.\r\nYou will be schoolmaster,\r\nAnd undertake the teaching of the maid:\r\nThat’s your device.\r\n\r\nLUCENTIO.\r\nIt is: may it be done?\r\n\r\nTRANIO.\r\nNot possible; for who shall bear your part\r\nAnd be in Padua here Vincentio’s son;\r\nKeep house and ply his book, welcome his friends;\r\nVisit his countrymen, and banquet them?\r\n\r\nLUCENTIO.\r\n_Basta_, content thee, for I have it full.\r\nWe have not yet been seen in any house,\r\nNor can we be distinguish’d by our faces\r\nFor man or master: then it follows thus:\r\nThou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,\r\nKeep house and port and servants, as I should;\r\nI will some other be; some Florentine,\r\nSome Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.\r\n’Tis hatch’d, and shall be so: Tranio, at once\r\nUncase thee; take my colour’d hat and cloak.\r\nWhen Biondello comes, he waits on thee;\r\nBut I will charm him first to keep his tongue.\r\n\r\n[_They exchange habits_]\r\n\r\nTRANIO.\r\nSo had you need.\r\nIn brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,\r\nAnd I am tied to be obedient;\r\nFor so your father charg’d me at our parting,\r\n‘Be serviceable to my son,’ quoth he,\r\nAlthough I think ’twas in another sense:\r\nI am content to be Lucentio,\r\nBecause so well I love Lucentio.\r\n\r\nLUCENTIO.\r\nTranio, be so, because Lucentio loves;\r\nAnd let me be a slave, to achieve that maid\r\nWhose sudden sight hath thrall’d my wounded eye.\r\n\nEnter Biondello.\r\n\r\nHere comes the rogue. Sirrah, where have you been?\r\n\r\nBIONDELLO.\r\nWhere have I been? Nay, how now! where are you?\r\nMaster, has my fellow Tranio stol’n your clothes?\r\nOr you stol’n his? or both? Pray, what’s the news?\r\n\r\nLUCENTIO.\r\nSirrah, come hither: ’tis no time to jest,\r\nAnd therefore frame your manners to the time.\r\nYour fellow Tranio here, to save my life,\r\nPuts my apparel and my count’nance on,\r\nAnd I for my escape have put on his;\r\nFor in a quarrel since I came ashore\r\nI kill’d a man, and fear I was descried.\r\nWait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,\r\nWhile I make way from hence to save my life.\r\nYou understand me?\r\n\r\nBIONDELLO.\r\nI, sir! Ne’er a whit.\r\n\r\nLUCENTIO.\r\nAnd not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:\r\nTranio is changed to Lucentio.\r\n\r\nBIONDELLO.\r\nThe better for him: would I were so too!\r\n\r\nTRANIO.\r\nSo could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,\r\nThat Lucentio indeed had Baptista’s youngest daughter.\r\nBut, sirrah, not for my sake but your master’s, I advise\r\nYou use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:\r\nWhen I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;\r\nBut in all places else your master, Lucentio.\r\n\r\nLUCENTIO.\r\nTranio, let’s go.\r\nOne thing more rests, that thyself execute,\r\nTo make one among these wooers: if thou ask me why,\r\nSufficeth my reasons are both good and weighty.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\n[_The Presenters above speak._]\r\n\r\nFIRST SERVANT.\r\nMy lord, you nod; you do not mind the play.\r\n\r\nSLY.\r\nYes, by Saint Anne, I do.

Padua. Before Hortensio’s house.\r\n\r\nEnter Petruchio and his man Grumio.\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nVerona, for a while I take my leave,\r\nTo see my friends in Padua; but of all\r\nMy best beloved and approved friend,\r\nHortensio; and I trow this is his house.\r\nHere, sirrah Grumio, knock, I say.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nKnock, sir? Whom should I knock? Is there any man has rebused your\r\nworship?\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nVillain, I say, knock me here soundly.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nKnock you here, sir? Why, sir, what am I, sir, that I should knock you\r\nhere, sir?\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nVillain, I say, knock me at this gate;\r\nAnd rap me well, or I’ll knock your knave’s pate.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nMy master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock you first,\r\nAnd then I know after who comes by the worst.\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nWill it not be?\r\nFaith, sirrah, and you’ll not knock, I’ll ring it;\r\nI’ll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.\r\n\r\n[_He wrings Grumio by the ears._]\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nHelp, masters, help! my master is mad.\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nNow, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!\r\n\nEnter Hortensio.\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\nHow now! what’s the matter? My old friend Grumio! and my good friend\r\nPetruchio! How do you all at Verona?\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nSignior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?\r\n_Con tutto il cuore ben trovato_, may I say.\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\n_Alla nostra casa ben venuto; molto honorato signor mio Petruchio._\r\nRise, Grumio, rise: we will compound this quarrel.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nNay, ’tis no matter, sir, what he ’leges in Latin. If this be not a\r\nlawful cause for me to leave his service, look you, sir, he bid me\r\nknock him and rap him soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant to\r\nuse his master so; being, perhaps, for aught I see, two-and-thirty, a\r\npip out? Whom would to God I had well knock’d at first, then had not\r\nGrumio come by the worst.\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nA senseless villain! Good Hortensio,\r\nI bade the rascal knock upon your gate,\r\nAnd could not get him for my heart to do it.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nKnock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not these words plain: ‘Sirrah\r\nknock me here, rap me here, knock me well, and knock me soundly’? And\r\ncome you now with ‘knocking at the gate’?\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nSirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\nPetruchio, patience; I am Grumio’s pledge;\r\nWhy, this’s a heavy chance ’twixt him and you,\r\nYour ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.\r\nAnd tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale\r\nBlows you to Padua here from old Verona?\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nSuch wind as scatters young men through the world\r\nTo seek their fortunes farther than at home,\r\nWhere small experience grows. But in a few,\r\nSignior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:\r\nAntonio, my father, is deceas’d,\r\nAnd I have thrust myself into this maze,\r\nHaply to wive and thrive as best I may;\r\nCrowns in my purse I have, and goods at home,\r\nAnd so am come abroad to see the world.\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\nPetruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee\r\nAnd wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour’d wife?\r\nThou’dst thank me but a little for my counsel;\r\nAnd yet I’ll promise thee she shall be rich,\r\nAnd very rich: but th’art too much my friend,\r\nAnd I’ll not wish thee to her.\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nSignior Hortensio, ’twixt such friends as we\r\nFew words suffice; and therefore, if thou know\r\nOne rich enough to be Petruchio’s wife,\r\nAs wealth is burden of my wooing dance,\r\nBe she as foul as was Florentius’ love,\r\nAs old as Sibyl, and as curst and shrewd\r\nAs Socrates’ Xanthippe or a worse,\r\nShe moves me not, or not removes, at least,\r\nAffection’s edge in me, were she as rough\r\nAs are the swelling Adriatic seas:\r\nI come to wive it wealthily in Padua;\r\nIf wealthily, then happily in Padua.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nNay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his mind is: why, give him\r\ngold enough and marry him to a puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot\r\nwith ne’er a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases as\r\ntwo-and-fifty horses: why, nothing comes amiss, so money comes withal.\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\nPetruchio, since we are stepp’d thus far in,\r\nI will continue that I broach’d in jest.\r\nI can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife\r\nWith wealth enough, and young and beauteous;\r\nBrought up as best becomes a gentlewoman:\r\nHer only fault,—and that is faults enough,—\r\nIs, that she is intolerable curst,\r\nAnd shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure,\r\nThat, were my state far worser than it is,\r\nI would not wed her for a mine of gold.\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nHortensio, peace! thou know’st not gold’s effect:\r\nTell me her father’s name, and ’tis enough;\r\nFor I will board her, though she chide as loud\r\nAs thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\nHer father is Baptista Minola,\r\nAn affable and courteous gentleman;\r\nHer name is Katherina Minola,\r\nRenown’d in Padua for her scolding tongue.\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nI know her father, though I know not her;\r\nAnd he knew my deceased father well.\r\nI will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;\r\nAnd therefore let me be thus bold with you,\r\nTo give you over at this first encounter,\r\nUnless you will accompany me thither.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nI pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts. O’ my word, and she\r\nknew him as well as I do, she would think scolding would do little good\r\nupon him. She may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so; why,\r\nthat’s nothing; and he begin once, he’ll rail in his rope-tricks. I’ll\r\ntell you what, sir, and she stand him but a little, he will throw a\r\nfigure in her face, and so disfigure her with it that she shall have no\r\nmore eyes to see withal than a cat. You know him not, sir.\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\nTarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,\r\nFor in Baptista’s keep my treasure is:\r\nHe hath the jewel of my life in hold,\r\nHis youngest daughter, beautiful Bianca,\r\nAnd her withholds from me and other more,\r\nSuitors to her and rivals in my love;\r\nSupposing it a thing impossible,\r\nFor those defects I have before rehears’d,\r\nThat ever Katherina will be woo’d:\r\nTherefore this order hath Baptista ta’en,\r\nThat none shall have access unto Bianca\r\nTill Katherine the curst have got a husband.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nKatherine the curst!\r\nA title for a maid of all titles the worst.\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\nNow shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,\r\nAnd offer me disguis’d in sober robes,\r\nTo old Baptista as a schoolmaster\r\nWell seen in music, to instruct Bianca;\r\nThat so I may, by this device at least\r\nHave leave and leisure to make love to her,\r\nAnd unsuspected court her by herself.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nHere’s no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks, how the young folks\r\nlay their heads together!\r\n\nEnter Gremio and Lucentio disguised, with books under his arm.\r\n\r\nMaster, master, look about you: who goes there, ha?\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\nPeace, Grumio! It is the rival of my love. Petruchio, stand by awhile.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nA proper stripling, and an amorous!\r\n\r\nGREMIO.\r\nO! very well; I have perus’d the note.\r\nHark you, sir; I’ll have them very fairly bound:\r\nAll books of love, see that at any hand,\r\nAnd see you read no other lectures to her.\r\nYou understand me. Over and beside\r\nSignior Baptista’s liberality,\r\nI’ll mend it with a largess. Take your papers too,\r\nAnd let me have them very well perfum’d;\r\nFor she is sweeter than perfume itself\r\nTo whom they go to. What will you read to her?\r\n\r\nLUCENTIO.\r\nWhate’er I read to her, I’ll plead for you,\r\nAs for my patron, stand you so assur’d,\r\nAs firmly as yourself were still in place;\r\nYea, and perhaps with more successful words\r\nThan you, unless you were a scholar, sir.\r\n\r\nGREMIO.\r\nO! this learning, what a thing it is.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nO! this woodcock, what an ass it is.\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nPeace, sirrah!\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\nGrumio, mum! God save you, Signior Gremio!\r\n\r\nGREMIO.\r\nAnd you are well met, Signior Hortensio.\r\nTrow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.\r\nI promis’d to enquire carefully\r\nAbout a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca;\r\nAnd by good fortune I have lighted well\r\nOn this young man; for learning and behaviour\r\nFit for her turn, well read in poetry\r\nAnd other books, good ones, I warrant ye.\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\n’Tis well; and I have met a gentleman\r\nHath promis’d me to help me to another,\r\nA fine musician to instruct our mistress:\r\nSo shall I no whit be behind in duty\r\nTo fair Bianca, so belov’d of me.\r\n\r\nGREMIO.\r\nBelov’d of me, and that my deeds shall prove.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\n[_Aside._] And that his bags shall prove.\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\nGremio, ’tis now no time to vent our love:\r\nListen to me, and if you speak me fair,\r\nI’ll tell you news indifferent good for either.\r\nHere is a gentleman whom by chance I met,\r\nUpon agreement from us to his liking,\r\nWill undertake to woo curst Katherine;\r\nYea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.\r\n\r\nGREMIO.\r\nSo said, so done, is well.\r\nHortensio, have you told him all her faults?\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nI know she is an irksome brawling scold;\r\nIf that be all, masters, I hear no harm.\r\n\r\nGREMIO.\r\nNo, say’st me so, friend? What countryman?\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nBorn in Verona, old Antonio’s son.\r\nMy father dead, my fortune lives for me;\r\nAnd I do hope good days and long to see.\r\n\r\nGREMIO.\r\nO sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange!\r\nBut if you have a stomach, to’t a God’s name;\r\nYou shall have me assisting you in all.\r\nBut will you woo this wild-cat?\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nWill I live?\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nWill he woo her? Ay, or I’ll hang her.\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nWhy came I hither but to that intent?\r\nThink you a little din can daunt mine ears?\r\nHave I not in my time heard lions roar?\r\nHave I not heard the sea, puff’d up with winds,\r\nRage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?\r\nHave I not heard great ordnance in the field,\r\nAnd heaven’s artillery thunder in the skies?\r\nHave I not in a pitched battle heard\r\nLoud ’larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets’ clang?\r\nAnd do you tell me of a woman’s tongue,\r\nThat gives not half so great a blow to hear\r\nAs will a chestnut in a farmer’s fire?\r\nTush, tush! fear boys with bugs.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\n[_Aside_] For he fears none.\r\n\r\nGREMIO.\r\nHortensio, hark:\r\nThis gentleman is happily arriv’d,\r\nMy mind presumes, for his own good and yours.\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\nI promis’d we would be contributors,\r\nAnd bear his charge of wooing, whatsoe’er.\r\n\r\nGREMIO.\r\nAnd so we will, provided that he win her.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nI would I were as sure of a good dinner.\r\n\nEnter Tranio brave, and Biondello.\r\n\r\nTRANIO.\r\nGentlemen, God save you! If I may be bold,\r\nTell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way\r\nTo the house of Signior Baptista Minola?\r\n\r\nBIONDELLO.\r\nHe that has the two fair daughters; is’t he you mean?\r\n\r\nTRANIO.\r\nEven he, Biondello!\r\n\r\nGREMIO.\r\nHark you, sir, you mean not her to—\r\n\r\nTRANIO.\r\nPerhaps him and her, sir; what have you to do?\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nNot her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.\r\n\r\nTRANIO.\r\nI love no chiders, sir.

A hall in Petruchio’s country house.\r\n\nEnter Grumio.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nFie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and all foul ways! Was\r\never man so beaten? Was ever man so ray’d? Was ever man so weary? I am\r\nsent before to make a fire, and they are coming after to warm them.\r\nNow, were not I a little pot and soon hot, my very lips might freeze to\r\nmy teeth, my tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my belly, ere\r\nI should come by a fire to thaw me. But I with blowing the fire shall\r\nwarm myself; for, considering the weather, a taller man than I will\r\ntake cold. Holla, ho! Curtis!\r\n\nEnter Curtis.\r\n\r\nCURTIS.\r\nWho is that calls so coldly?\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nA piece of ice: if thou doubt it, thou mayst slide from my shoulder to\r\nmy heel with no greater a run but my head and my neck. A fire, good\r\nCurtis.\r\n\r\nCURTIS.\r\nIs my master and his wife coming, Grumio?\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nO, ay! Curtis, ay; and therefore fire, fire; cast on no water.\r\n\r\nCURTIS.\r\nIs she so hot a shrew as she’s reported?\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nShe was, good Curtis, before this frost; but thou knowest winter tames\r\nman, woman, and beast; for it hath tamed my old master, and my new\r\nmistress, and myself, fellow Curtis.\r\n\r\nCURTIS.\r\nAway, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nAm I but three inches? Why, thy horn is a foot; and so long am I at the\r\nleast. But wilt thou make a fire, or shall I complain on thee to our\r\nmistress, whose hand,—she being now at hand,— thou shalt soon feel, to\r\nthy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot office?\r\n\r\nCURTIS.\r\nI prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nA cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and therefore fire. Do\r\nthy duty, and have thy duty, for my master and mistress are almost\r\nfrozen to death.\r\n\r\nCURTIS.\r\nThere’s fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nWhy, ‘Jack boy! ho, boy!’ and as much news as wilt thou.\r\n\r\nCURTIS.\r\nCome, you are so full of cony-catching.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nWhy, therefore, fire; for I have caught extreme cold. Where’s the cook?\r\nIs supper ready, the house trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept, the\r\nservingmen in their new fustian, their white stockings, and every\r\nofficer his wedding-garment on? Be the Jacks fair within, the Jills\r\nfair without, and carpets laid, and everything in order?\r\n\r\nCURTIS.\r\nAll ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nFirst, know my horse is tired; my master and mistress fallen out.\r\n\r\nCURTIS.\r\nHow?\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nOut of their saddles into the dirt; and thereby hangs a tale.\r\n\r\nCURTIS.\r\nLet’s ha’t, good Grumio.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nLend thine ear.\r\n\r\nCURTIS.\r\nHere.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\n[_Striking him._] There.\r\n\r\nCURTIS.\r\nThis ’tis to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nAnd therefore ’tis called a sensible tale; and this cuff was but to\r\nknock at your ear and beseech listening. Now I begin: _Imprimis_, we\r\ncame down a foul hill, my master riding behind my mistress,—\r\n\r\nCURTIS.\r\nBoth of one horse?\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nWhat’s that to thee?\r\n\r\nCURTIS.\r\nWhy, a horse.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nTell thou the tale: but hadst thou not crossed me, thou shouldst have\r\nheard how her horse fell, and she under her horse; thou shouldst have\r\nheard in how miry a place, how she was bemoiled; how he left her with\r\nthe horse upon her; how he beat me because her horse stumbled; how she\r\nwaded through the dirt to pluck him off me: how he swore; how she\r\nprayed, that never prayed before; how I cried; how the horses ran away;\r\nhow her bridle was burst; how I lost my crupper; with many things of\r\nworthy memory, which now shall die in oblivion, and thou return\r\nunexperienced to thy grave.\r\n\r\nCURTIS.\r\nBy this reckoning he is more shrew than she.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nAy; and that thou and the proudest of you all shall find when he comes\r\nhome. But what talk I of this? Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas,\r\nPhilip, Walter, Sugarsop, and the rest; let their heads be sleekly\r\ncombed, their blue coats brush’d and their garters of an indifferent\r\nknit; let them curtsy with their left legs, and not presume to touch a\r\nhair of my master’s horse-tail till they kiss their hands. Are they all\r\nready?\r\n\r\nCURTIS.\r\nThey are.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nCall them forth.\r\n\r\nCURTIS.\r\nDo you hear? ho! You must meet my master to countenance my mistress.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nWhy, she hath a face of her own.\r\n\r\nCURTIS.\r\nWho knows not that?\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nThou, it seems, that calls for company to countenance her.\r\n\r\nCURTIS.\r\nI call them forth to credit her.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nWhy, she comes to borrow nothing of them.\r\n\nEnter four or five Servants.\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL.\r\nWelcome home, Grumio!\r\n\r\nPHILIP.\r\nHow now, Grumio!\r\n\r\nJOSEPH.\r\nWhat, Grumio!\r\n\r\nNICHOLAS.\r\nFellow Grumio!\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL.\r\nHow now, old lad!\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nWelcome, you; how now, you; what, you; fellow, you; and thus much for\r\ngreeting.

Thou hast braved many men; brave not me: I will neither be\r\nfac’d nor brav’d. I say unto thee, I bid thy master cut out the gown;\r\nbut I did not bid him cut it to pieces: ergo, thou liest.\r\n\r\nTAILOR.\r\nWhy, here is the note of the fashion to testify.\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nRead it.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nThe note lies in ’s throat, if he say I said so.\r\n\r\nTAILOR.\r\n’Imprimis, a loose-bodied gown.’\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nMaster, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in the skirts of it\r\nand beat me to death with a bottom of brown thread; I said, a gown.\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nProceed.\r\n\r\nTAILOR.\r\n‘With a small compassed cape.’\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nI confess the cape.\r\n\r\nTAILOR.\r\n‘With a trunk sleeve.’\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nI confess two sleeves.\r\n\r\nTAILOR.\r\n‘The sleeves curiously cut.’\r\n\r\nPETRUCHIO.\r\nAy, there’s the villainy.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nError i’ the bill, sir; error i’ the bill. I commanded the sleeves\r\nshould be cut out, and sew’d up again; and that I’ll prove upon thee,\r\nthough thy little finger be armed in a thimble.\r\n\r\nTAILOR.\r\nThis is true that I say; and I had thee in place where thou shouldst\r\nknow it.\r\n\r\nGRUMIO.\r\nI am for thee straight; take thou the bill, give me thy mete-yard, and\r\nspare not me.\r\n\r\nHORTENSIO.\r\nGod-a-mercy, Grumio!

Where’s the master?\r\nPlay the men.\r\n\r\nBOATSWAIN.\r\nI pray now, keep below.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nWhere is the master, boson?\r\n\r\nBOATSWAIN.\r\nDo you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your cabins: you do\r\nassist the storm.\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nNay, good, be patient.\r\n\r\nBOATSWAIN.\r\nWhen the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers for the name of king?\r\nTo cabin! silence! Trouble us not.\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nGood, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.\r\n\r\nBOATSWAIN.\r\nNone that I more love than myself. You are a counsellor: if you can\r\ncommand these elements to silence, and work the peace of the present,\r\nwe will not hand a rope more. Use your authority: if you cannot, give\r\nthanks you have lived so long, and make yourself ready in your cabin\r\nfor the mischance of the hour, if it so hap.—Cheerly, good hearts!—Out\r\nof our way, I say.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nI have great comfort from this fellow. Methinks he hath no drowning\r\nmark upon him. His complexion is perfect gallows. Stand fast, good\r\nFate, to his hanging! Make the rope of his destiny our cable, for our\r\nown doth little advantage! If he be not born to be hang’d, our case is\r\nmiserable.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\n Re-enter Boatswain.\r\n\r\nBOATSWAIN.\r\nDown with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring her to try wi’ th’\r\nmaincourse.\r\n\r\n [_A cry within._]\r\n\r\n A plague upon this howling! They are louder than the weather or our\r\n office.\r\n\r\n Enter Sebastian, Antonio and Gonzalo.\r\n\r\nYet again! What do you here? Shall we give o’er, and drown? Have you a\r\nmind to sink?\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nA pox o’ your throat, you bawling, blasphemous, incharitable dog!\r\n\r\nBOATSWAIN.\r\nWork you, then.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nHang, cur, hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker! We are less afraid\r\nto be drowned than thou art.\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nI’ll warrant him for drowning, though the ship were no stronger than a\r\nnutshell, and as leaky as an unstanched wench.\r\n\r\nBOATSWAIN.\r\nLay her a-hold, a-hold! Set her two courses: off to sea again: lay her\r\noff.\r\n\r\n Enter Mariners, wet.\r\n\r\nMARINERS.\r\nAll lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nBOATSWAIN.\r\nWhat, must our mouths be cold?\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nThe King and Prince at prayers! Let’s assist them,\r\nFor our case is as theirs.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nI am out of patience.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nWe are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards.\r\nThis wide-chapp’d rascal—would thou might’st lie drowning\r\nThe washing of ten tides!\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nHe’ll be hang’d yet,\r\nThough every drop of water swear against it,\r\nAnd gape at wid’st to glut him.\r\n\r\n_A confused noise within: _“Mercy on us!”—\r\n“We split, we split!”—“Farewell, my wife and children!”—\r\n“Farewell, brother!”—“We split, we split, we split!”\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nLet’s all sink wi’ th’ King.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nLet’s take leave of him.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nNow would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren\r\nground. Long heath, brown furze, anything. The wills above be done! but\r\nI would fain die a dry death.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. The Island. Before the cell of Prospero.\r\n\r\n Enter Prospero and Miranda.\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\nIf by your art, my dearest father, you have\r\nPut the wild waters in this roar, allay them.\r\nThe sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,\r\nBut that the sea, mounting to th’ welkin’s cheek,\r\nDashes the fire out. O! I have suffered\r\nWith those that I saw suffer! A brave vessel,\r\nWho had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,\r\nDash’d all to pieces. O, the cry did knock\r\nAgainst my very heart. Poor souls, they perish’d.\r\nHad I been any god of power, I would\r\nHave sunk the sea within the earth, or ere\r\nIt should the good ship so have swallow’d and\r\nThe fraughting souls within her.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nBe collected:\r\nNo more amazement: tell your piteous heart\r\nThere’s no harm done.\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\nO, woe the day!\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nNo harm.\r\nI have done nothing but in care of thee,\r\nOf thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who\r\nArt ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing\r\nOf whence I am, nor that I am more better\r\nThan Prospero, master of a full poor cell,\r\nAnd thy no greater father.\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\nMore to know\r\nDid never meddle with my thoughts.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\n’Tis time\r\nI should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,\r\nAnd pluck my magic garment from me.—So:\r\n\r\n [_Lays down his mantle._]\r\n\r\nLie there my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.\r\nThe direful spectacle of the wrack, which touch’d\r\nThe very virtue of compassion in thee,\r\nI have with such provision in mine art\r\nSo safely ordered that there is no soul—\r\nNo, not so much perdition as an hair\r\nBetid to any creature in the vessel\r\nWhich thou heard’st cry, which thou saw’st sink. Sit down;\r\nFor thou must now know farther.\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\nYou have often\r\nBegun to tell me what I am, but stopp’d,\r\nAnd left me to a bootless inquisition,\r\nConcluding “Stay; not yet.”\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nThe hour’s now come,\r\nThe very minute bids thee ope thine ear;\r\nObey, and be attentive. Canst thou remember\r\nA time before we came unto this cell?\r\nI do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not\r\nOut three years old.\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\nCertainly, sir, I can.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nBy what? By any other house, or person?\r\nOf anything the image, tell me, that\r\nHath kept with thy remembrance.\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\n’Tis far off,\r\nAnd rather like a dream than an assurance\r\nThat my remembrance warrants. Had I not\r\nFour or five women once that tended me?\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nThou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it\r\nThat this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else\r\nIn the dark backward and abysm of time?\r\nIf thou rememb’rest aught ere thou cam’st here,\r\nHow thou cam’st here, thou mayst.\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\nBut that I do not.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nTwelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,\r\nThy father was the Duke of Milan, and\r\nA prince of power.\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\nSir, are not you my father?\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nThy mother was a piece of virtue, and\r\nShe said thou wast my daughter. And thy father\r\nWas Duke of Milan, and his only heir\r\nAnd princess, no worse issued.\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\nO, the heavens!\r\nWhat foul play had we that we came from thence?\r\nOr blessed was’t we did?\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nBoth, both, my girl.\r\nBy foul play, as thou say’st, were we heav’d thence;\r\nBut blessedly holp hither.\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\nO, my heart bleeds\r\nTo think o’ th’ teen that I have turn’d you to,\r\nWhich is from my remembrance. Please you, farther.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nMy brother and thy uncle, call’d Antonio—\r\nI pray thee, mark me, that a brother should\r\nBe so perfidious!—he whom next thyself\r\nOf all the world I lov’d, and to him put\r\nThe manage of my state; as at that time\r\nThrough all the signories it was the first,\r\nAnd Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed\r\nIn dignity, and for the liberal arts,\r\nWithout a parallel: those being all my study,\r\nThe government I cast upon my brother,\r\nAnd to my state grew stranger, being transported\r\nAnd rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle—\r\nDost thou attend me?\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\nSir, most heedfully.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nBeing once perfected how to grant suits,\r\nHow to deny them, who t’ advance, and who\r\nTo trash for over-topping, new created\r\nThe creatures that were mine, I say, or chang’d ’em,\r\nOr else new form’d ’em: having both the key\r\nOf officer and office, set all hearts i’ th’ state\r\nTo what tune pleas’d his ear: that now he was\r\nThe ivy which had hid my princely trunk,\r\nAnd suck’d my verdure out on ’t. Thou attend’st not.\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\nO, good sir! I do.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nI pray thee, mark me.\r\nI, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated\r\nTo closeness and the bettering of my mind\r\nWith that which, but by being so retir’d,\r\nO’er-priz’d all popular rate, in my false brother\r\nAwak’d an evil nature; and my trust,\r\nLike a good parent, did beget of him\r\nA falsehood in its contrary as great\r\nAs my trust was; which had indeed no limit,\r\nA confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,\r\nNot only with what my revenue yielded,\r\nBut what my power might else exact, like one\r\nWho having into truth, by telling of it,\r\nMade such a sinner of his memory,\r\nTo credit his own lie, he did believe\r\nHe was indeed the Duke; out o’ the substitution,\r\nAnd executing th’ outward face of royalty,\r\nWith all prerogative. Hence his ambition growing—\r\nDost thou hear?\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\nYour tale, sir, would cure deafness.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nTo have no screen between this part he play’d\r\nAnd him he play’d it for, he needs will be\r\nAbsolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library\r\nWas dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties\r\nHe thinks me now incapable; confederates,\r\nSo dry he was for sway, wi’ th’ King of Naples\r\nTo give him annual tribute, do him homage,\r\nSubject his coronet to his crown, and bend\r\nThe dukedom, yet unbow’d—alas, poor Milan!—\r\nTo most ignoble stooping.\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\nO the heavens!\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nMark his condition, and the event; then tell me\r\nIf this might be a brother.\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\nI should sin\r\nTo think but nobly of my grandmother:\r\nGood wombs have borne bad sons.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nNow the condition.\r\nThis King of Naples, being an enemy\r\nTo me inveterate, hearkens my brother’s suit;\r\nWhich was, that he, in lieu o’ th’ premises\r\nOf homage and I know not how much tribute,\r\nShould presently extirpate me and mine\r\nOut of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan,\r\nWith all the honours on my brother: whereon,\r\nA treacherous army levied, one midnight\r\nFated to th’ purpose, did Antonio open\r\nThe gates of Milan; and, i’ th’ dead of darkness,\r\nThe ministers for th’ purpose hurried thence\r\nMe and thy crying self.\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\nAlack, for pity!\r\nI, not rememb’ring how I cried out then,\r\nWill cry it o’er again: it is a hint\r\nThat wrings mine eyes to ’t.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nHear a little further,\r\nAnd then I’ll bring thee to the present business\r\nWhich now’s upon us; without the which this story\r\nWere most impertinent.\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\nWherefore did they not\r\nThat hour destroy us?\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nWell demanded, wench:\r\nMy tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,\r\nSo dear the love my people bore me, nor set\r\nA mark so bloody on the business; but\r\nWith colours fairer painted their foul ends.\r\nIn few, they hurried us aboard a bark,\r\nBore us some leagues to sea, where they prepared\r\nA rotten carcass of a butt, not rigg’d,\r\nNor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats\r\nInstinctively have quit it. There they hoist us,\r\nTo cry to th’ sea, that roar’d to us; to sigh\r\nTo th’ winds, whose pity, sighing back again,\r\nDid us but loving wrong.\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\nAlack, what trouble\r\nWas I then to you!\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nO, a cherubin\r\nThou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile,\r\nInfused with a fortitude from heaven,\r\nWhen I have deck’d the sea with drops full salt,\r\nUnder my burden groan’d: which rais’d in me\r\nAn undergoing stomach, to bear up\r\nAgainst what should ensue.\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\nHow came we ashore?\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nBy Providence divine.\r\nSome food we had and some fresh water that\r\nA noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,\r\nOut of his charity, who being then appointed\r\nMaster of this design, did give us, with\r\nRich garments, linens, stuffs, and necessaries,\r\nWhich since have steaded much: so, of his gentleness,\r\nKnowing I lov’d my books, he furnish’d me\r\nFrom mine own library with volumes that\r\nI prize above my dukedom.\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\nWould I might\r\nBut ever see that man!\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nNow I arise.\r\nSit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.\r\nHere in this island we arriv’d; and here\r\nHave I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit\r\nThan other princes can, that have more time\r\nFor vainer hours, and tutors not so careful.\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\nHeavens thank you for ’t! And now, I pray you, sir,\r\nFor still ’tis beating in my mind, your reason\r\nFor raising this sea-storm?\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nKnow thus far forth.\r\nBy accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,\r\nNow my dear lady, hath mine enemies\r\nBrought to this shore; and by my prescience\r\nI find my zenith doth depend upon\r\nA most auspicious star, whose influence\r\nIf now I court not but omit, my fortunes\r\nWill ever after droop. Here cease more questions;\r\nThou art inclin’d to sleep; ’tis a good dulness,\r\nAnd give it way. I know thou canst not choose.\r\n\r\n [_Miranda sleeps._]\r\n\r\nCome away, servant, come! I am ready now.\r\nApproach, my Ariel. Come!\r\n\r\n Enter Ariel.\r\n\r\nARIEL.\r\nAll hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come\r\nTo answer thy best pleasure; be’t to fly,\r\nTo swim, to dive into the fire, to ride\r\nOn the curl’d clouds, to thy strong bidding task\r\nAriel and all his quality.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nHast thou, spirit,\r\nPerform’d to point the tempest that I bade thee?\r\n\r\nARIEL.\r\nTo every article.\r\nI boarded the King’s ship; now on the beak,\r\nNow in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,\r\nI flam’d amazement; sometime I’d divide,\r\nAnd burn in many places; on the topmast,\r\nThe yards, and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,\r\nThen meet and join. Jove’s lightning, the precursors\r\nO’ th’ dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary\r\nAnd sight-outrunning were not: the fire and cracks\r\nOf sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune\r\nSeem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,\r\nYea, his dread trident shake.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nMy brave spirit!\r\nWho was so firm, so constant, that this coil\r\nWould not infect his reason?\r\n\r\nARIEL.\r\nNot a soul\r\nBut felt a fever of the mad, and play’d\r\nSome tricks of desperation. All but mariners\r\nPlunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,\r\nThen all afire with me: the King’s son, Ferdinand,\r\nWith hair up-staring—then like reeds, not hair—\r\nWas the first man that leapt; cried “Hell is empty,\r\nAnd all the devils are here.”\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nWhy, that’s my spirit!\r\nBut was not this nigh shore?\r\n\r\nARIEL.\r\nClose by, my master.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nBut are they, Ariel, safe?\r\n\r\nARIEL.\r\nNot a hair perish’d;\r\nOn their sustaining garments not a blemish,\r\nBut fresher than before: and, as thou bad’st me,\r\nIn troops I have dispers’d them ’bout the isle.\r\nThe King’s son have I landed by himself,\r\nWhom I left cooling of the air with sighs\r\nIn an odd angle of the isle, and sitting,\r\nHis arms in this sad knot.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nOf the King’s ship\r\nThe mariners, say how thou hast dispos’d,\r\nAnd all the rest o’ th’ fleet?\r\n\r\nARIEL.\r\nSafely in harbour\r\nIs the King’s ship; in the deep nook, where once\r\nThou call’dst me up at midnight to fetch dew\r\nFrom the still-vex’d Bermoothes; there she’s hid:\r\nThe mariners all under hatches stowed;\r\nWho, with a charm join’d to their suff’red labour,\r\nI have left asleep: and for the rest o’ th’ fleet,\r\nWhich I dispers’d, they all have met again,\r\nAnd are upon the Mediterranean flote\r\nBound sadly home for Naples,\r\nSupposing that they saw the King’s ship wrack’d,\r\nAnd his great person perish.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nAriel, thy charge\r\nExactly is perform’d; but there’s more work.\r\nWhat is the time o’ th’ day?\r\n\r\nARIEL.\r\nPast the mid season.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nAt least two glasses. The time ’twixt six and now\r\nMust by us both be spent most preciously.\r\n\r\nARIEL.\r\nIs there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,\r\nLet me remember thee what thou hast promis’d,\r\nWhich is not yet perform’d me.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nHow now! moody?\r\nWhat is’t thou canst demand?\r\n\r\nARIEL.\r\nMy liberty.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nBefore the time be out? No more!\r\n\r\nARIEL.\r\nI prithee,\r\nRemember I have done thee worthy service;\r\nTold thee no lies, made no mistakings, serv’d\r\nWithout or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise\r\nTo bate me a full year.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nDost thou forget\r\nFrom what a torment I did free thee?\r\n\r\nARIEL.\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nThou dost, and think’st it much to tread the ooze\r\nOf the salt deep,\r\nTo run upon the sharp wind of the north,\r\nTo do me business in the veins o’ th’ earth\r\nWhen it is bak’d with frost.\r\n\r\nARIEL.\r\nI do not, sir.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nThou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot\r\nThe foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy\r\nWas grown into a hoop? Hast thou forgot her?\r\n\r\nARIEL.\r\nNo, sir.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nThou hast. Where was she born? Speak; tell me.\r\n\r\nARIEL.\r\nSir, in Argier.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nO, was she so? I must\r\nOnce in a month recount what thou hast been,\r\nWhich thou forget’st. This damn’d witch Sycorax,\r\nFor mischiefs manifold, and sorceries terrible\r\nTo enter human hearing, from Argier,\r\nThou know’st, was banish’d: for one thing she did\r\nThey would not take her life. Is not this true?\r\n\r\nARIEL.\r\nAy, sir.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nThis blue-ey’d hag was hither brought with child,\r\nAnd here was left by th’ sailors. Thou, my slave,\r\nAs thou report’st thyself, wast then her servant;\r\nAnd, for thou wast a spirit too delicate\r\nTo act her earthy and abhorr’d commands,\r\nRefusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,\r\nBy help of her more potent ministers,\r\nAnd in her most unmitigable rage,\r\nInto a cloven pine; within which rift\r\nImprison’d, thou didst painfully remain\r\nA dozen years; within which space she died,\r\nAnd left thee there, where thou didst vent thy groans\r\nAs fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island—\r\nSave for the son that she did litter here,\r\nA freckl’d whelp, hag-born—not honour’d with\r\nA human shape.\r\n\r\nARIEL.\r\nYes, Caliban her son.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nDull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban,\r\nWhom now I keep in service. Thou best know’st\r\nWhat torment I did find thee in; thy groans\r\nDid make wolves howl, and penetrate the breasts\r\nOf ever-angry bears: it was a torment\r\nTo lay upon the damn’d, which Sycorax\r\nCould not again undo; it was mine art,\r\nWhen I arriv’d and heard thee, that made gape\r\nThe pine, and let thee out.\r\n\r\nARIEL.\r\nI thank thee, master.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nIf thou more murmur’st, I will rend an oak\r\nAnd peg thee in his knotty entrails till\r\nThou hast howl’d away twelve winters.\r\n\r\nARIEL.\r\nPardon, master:\r\nI will be correspondent to command,\r\nAnd do my spriting gently.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nDo so; and after two days\r\nI will discharge thee.\r\n\r\nARIEL.\r\nThat’s my noble master!\r\nWhat shall I do? Say what? What shall I do?\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nGo make thyself like a nymph o’ th’ sea. Be subject\r\nTo no sight but thine and mine; invisible\r\nTo every eyeball else. Go, take this shape,\r\nAnd hither come in ’t. Go, hence with diligence!\r\n\r\n [_Exit Ariel._]\r\n\r\nAwake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well;\r\nAwake!\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\n[_Waking._] The strangeness of your story put\r\nHeaviness in me.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nShake it off. Come on;\r\nWe’ll visit Caliban my slave, who never\r\nYields us kind answer.\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\n’Tis a villain, sir,\r\nI do not love to look on.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nBut as ’tis,\r\nWe cannot miss him: he does make our fire,\r\nFetch in our wood; and serves in offices\r\nThat profit us. What ho! slave! Caliban!\r\nThou earth, thou! Speak.\r\n\r\nCALIBAN.\r\n[_Within._] There’s wood enough within.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nCome forth, I say; there’s other business for thee.\r\nCome, thou tortoise! when?\r\n\r\n Re-enter Ariel like a water-nymph.\r\n\r\nFine apparition! My quaint Ariel,\r\nHark in thine ear.\r\n\r\nARIEL.\r\nMy lord, it shall be done.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nThou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself\r\nUpon thy wicked dam, come forth!\r\n\r\n Enter Caliban.\r\n\r\nCALIBAN.\r\nAs wicked dew as e’er my mother brush’d\r\nWith raven’s feather from unwholesome fen\r\nDrop on you both! A south-west blow on ye,\r\nAnd blister you all o’er!\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nFor this, be sure, tonight thou shalt have cramps,\r\nSide-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins\r\nShall forth at vast of night that they may work\r\nAll exercise on thee. Thou shalt be pinch’d\r\nAs thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging\r\nThan bees that made them.\r\n\r\nCALIBAN.\r\nI must eat my dinner.\r\nThis island’s mine, by Sycorax my mother,\r\nWhich thou tak’st from me. When thou cam’st first,\r\nThou strok’st me and made much of me; wouldst give me\r\nWater with berries in ’t; and teach me how\r\nTo name the bigger light, and how the less,\r\nThat burn by day and night: and then I lov’d thee,\r\nAnd show’d thee all the qualities o’ th’ isle,\r\nThe fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place, and fertile.\r\nCurs’d be I that did so! All the charms\r\nOf Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!\r\nFor I am all the subjects that you have,\r\nWhich first was mine own King; and here you sty me\r\nIn this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me\r\nThe rest o’ th’ island.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nThou most lying slave,\r\nWhom stripes may move, not kindness! I have us’d thee,\r\nFilth as thou art, with human care, and lodg’d thee\r\nIn mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate\r\nThe honour of my child.\r\n\r\nCALIBAN.\r\nOh ho! Oh ho! Would ’t had been done!\r\nThou didst prevent me; I had peopled else\r\nThis isle with Calibans.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nAbhorred slave,\r\nWhich any print of goodness wilt not take,\r\nBeing capable of all ill! I pitied thee,\r\nTook pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour\r\nOne thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,\r\nKnow thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like\r\nA thing most brutish, I endow’d thy purposes\r\nWith words that made them known.

Our hint of woe\r\nIs common; every day, some sailor’s wife,\r\nThe masters of some merchant and the merchant,\r\nHave just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,\r\nI mean our preservation, few in millions\r\nCan speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh\r\nOur sorrow with our comfort.\r\n\r\nALONSO.\r\nPrithee, peace.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nHe receives comfort like cold porridge.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nThe visitor will not give him o’er so.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nLook, he’s winding up the watch of his wit; by and by it will strike.\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nSir,—\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nOne: tell.\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nWhen every grief is entertain’d that’s offer’d,\r\nComes to the entertainer—\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nA dollar.\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nDolour comes to him, indeed: you have spoken truer than you purposed.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nYou have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nTherefore, my lord,—\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nFie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!\r\n\r\nALONSO.\r\nI prithee, spare.\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nWell, I have done: but yet—\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nHe will be talking.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nWhich, of he or Adrian, for a good wager, first begins to crow?\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nThe old cock.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nThe cockerel.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nDone. The wager?\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nA laughter.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nA match!\r\n\r\nADRIAN.\r\nThough this island seem to be desert,—\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nHa, ha, ha!\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nSo. You’re paid.\r\n\r\nADRIAN.\r\nUninhabitable, and almost inaccessible,—\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nYet—\r\n\r\nADRIAN.\r\nYet—\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nHe could not miss ’t.\r\n\r\nADRIAN.\r\nIt must needs be of subtle, tender, and delicate temperance.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nTemperance was a delicate wench.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nAy, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered.\r\n\r\nADRIAN.\r\nThe air breathes upon us here most sweetly.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nAs if it had lungs, and rotten ones.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nOr, as ’twere perfum’d by a fen.\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nHere is everything advantageous to life.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nTrue; save means to live.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nOf that there’s none, or little.\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nHow lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nThe ground indeed is tawny.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nWith an eye of green in’t.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nHe misses not much.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nNo; he doth but mistake the truth totally.\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nBut the rarity of it is,—which is indeed almost beyond credit,—\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nAs many vouch’d rarities are.\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nThat our garments, being, as they were, drenched in the sea, hold\r\nnotwithstanding their freshness and glosses, being rather new-dyed than\r\nstained with salt water.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nIf but one of his pockets could speak, would it not say he lies?\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nAy, or very falsely pocket up his report.\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nMethinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in\r\nAfric, at the marriage of the King’s fair daughter Claribel to the King\r\nof Tunis.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\n’Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.\r\n\r\nADRIAN.\r\nTunis was never graced before with such a paragon to their Queen.\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nNot since widow Dido’s time.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nWidow! a pox o’ that! How came that widow in? Widow Dido!\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nWhat if he had said, widower Aeneas too?\r\nGood Lord, how you take it!\r\n\r\nADRIAN.\r\nWidow Dido said you? You make me study of that; she was of Carthage,\r\nnot of Tunis.\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nThis Tunis, sir, was Carthage.\r\n\r\nADRIAN.\r\nCarthage?\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nI assure you, Carthage.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nHis word is more than the miraculous harp.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nHe hath rais’d the wall, and houses too.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nWhat impossible matter will he make easy next?\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nI think he will carry this island home in his pocket, and give it his\r\nson for an apple.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nAnd, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring forth more islands.\r\n\r\nALONSO.\r\nAy.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nWhy, in good time.\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\n[_To Alonso._] Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh\r\nas when we were at Tunis at the marriage of your daughter, who is now\r\nQueen.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nAnd the rarest that e’er came there.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nBate, I beseech you, widow Dido.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nO! widow Dido; ay, widow Dido.\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nIs not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I wore it? I mean, in\r\na sort.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nThat sort was well fish’d for.\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nWhen I wore it at your daughter’s marriage?\r\n\r\nALONSO.\r\nYou cram these words into mine ears against\r\nThe stomach of my sense. Would I had never\r\nMarried my daughter there! for, coming thence,\r\nMy son is lost; and, in my rate, she too,\r\nWho is so far from Italy removed,\r\nI ne’er again shall see her. O thou mine heir\r\nOf Naples and of Milan, what strange fish\r\nHath made his meal on thee?\r\n\r\nFRANCISCO.\r\nSir, he may live:\r\nI saw him beat the surges under him,\r\nAnd ride upon their backs. He trod the water,\r\nWhose enmity he flung aside, and breasted\r\nThe surge most swoln that met him. His bold head\r\n’Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oared\r\nHimself with his good arms in lusty stroke\r\nTo th’ shore, that o’er his wave-worn basis bowed,\r\nAs stooping to relieve him. I not doubt\r\nHe came alive to land.\r\n\r\nALONSO.\r\nNo, no, he’s gone.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nSir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,\r\nThat would not bless our Europe with your daughter,\r\nBut rather lose her to an African;\r\nWhere she, at least, is banish’d from your eye,\r\nWho hath cause to wet the grief on ’t.\r\n\r\nALONSO.\r\nPrithee, peace.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nYou were kneel’d to, and importun’d otherwise\r\nBy all of us; and the fair soul herself\r\nWeigh’d between loathness and obedience at\r\nWhich end o’ th’ beam should bow. We have lost your son,\r\nI fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have\r\nMore widows in them of this business’ making,\r\nThan we bring men to comfort them.\r\nThe fault’s your own.\r\n\r\nALONSO.\r\nSo is the dear’st o’ th’ loss.\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nMy lord Sebastian,\r\nThe truth you speak doth lack some gentleness\r\nAnd time to speak it in. You rub the sore,\r\nWhen you should bring the plaster.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nVery well.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nAnd most chirurgeonly.\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nIt is foul weather in us all, good sir,\r\nWhen you are cloudy.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nFoul weather?\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nVery foul.\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nHad I plantation of this isle, my lord,—\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nHe’d sow ’t with nettle-seed.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nOr docks, or mallows.\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nAnd were the King on’t, what would I do?\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\n’Scape being drunk for want of wine.\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nI’ th’ commonwealth I would by contraries\r\nExecute all things; for no kind of traffic\r\nWould I admit; no name of magistrate;\r\nLetters should not be known; riches, poverty,\r\nAnd use of service, none; contract, succession,\r\nBourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;\r\nNo use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;\r\nNo occupation; all men idle, all;\r\nAnd women too, but innocent and pure;\r\nNo sovereignty,—\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nYet he would be King on’t.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nThe latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginning.\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nAll things in common nature should produce\r\nWithout sweat or endeavour; treason, felony,\r\nSword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,\r\nWould I not have; but nature should bring forth,\r\nOf it own kind, all foison, all abundance,\r\nTo feed my innocent people.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nNo marrying ’mong his subjects?\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nNone, man; all idle; whores and knaves.\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nI would with such perfection govern, sir,\r\nT’ excel the Golden Age.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nSave his Majesty!\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nLong live Gonzalo!\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nAnd,—do you mark me, sir?\r\n\r\nALONSO.\r\nPrithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nI do well believe your highness; and did it to minister occasion to\r\nthese gentlemen, who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that they\r\nalways use to laugh at nothing.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\n’Twas you we laughed at.\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nWho in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to you. So you may\r\ncontinue, and laugh at nothing still.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nWhat a blow was there given!\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nAn it had not fallen flat-long.\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nYou are gentlemen of brave mettle. You would lift the moon out of her\r\nsphere, if she would continue in it five weeks without changing.\r\n\r\n Enter Ariel, invisible, playing solemn music.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nWe would so, and then go a-bat-fowling.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nNay, good my lord, be not angry.\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nNo, I warrant you; I will not adventure my discretion so weakly. Will\r\nyou laugh me asleep, for I am very heavy?\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nGo sleep, and hear us.\r\n\r\n [_All sleep but Alonso, Sebastian and Antonio._]\r\n\r\nALONSO.\r\nWhat, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes\r\nWould, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find\r\nThey are inclin’d to do so.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nPlease you, sir,\r\nDo not omit the heavy offer of it:\r\nIt seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,\r\nIt is a comforter.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nWe two, my lord,\r\nWill guard your person while you take your rest,\r\nAnd watch your safety.\r\n\r\nALONSO.\r\nThank you. Wondrous heavy!\r\n\r\n [_Alonso sleeps. Exit Ariel._]\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nWhat a strange drowsiness possesses them!\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nIt is the quality o’ th’ climate.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nWhy\r\nDoth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not\r\nMyself dispos’d to sleep.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nNor I. My spirits are nimble.\r\nThey fell together all, as by consent;\r\nThey dropp’d, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,\r\nWorthy Sebastian? O, what might?—No more.\r\nAnd yet methinks I see it in thy face,\r\nWhat thou shouldst be. Th’ occasion speaks thee; and\r\nMy strong imagination sees a crown\r\nDropping upon thy head.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nWhat, art thou waking?\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nDo you not hear me speak?\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nI do; and surely\r\nIt is a sleepy language, and thou speak’st\r\nOut of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?\r\nThis is a strange repose, to be asleep\r\nWith eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,\r\nAnd yet so fast asleep.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nNoble Sebastian,\r\nThou let’st thy fortune sleep—die rather; wink’st\r\nWhiles thou art waking.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nThou dost snore distinctly:\r\nThere’s meaning in thy snores.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nI am more serious than my custom; you\r\nMust be so too, if heed me; which to do\r\nTrebles thee o’er.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nWell, I am standing water.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nI’ll teach you how to flow.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nDo so: to ebb,\r\nHereditary sloth instructs me.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nO,\r\nIf you but knew how you the purpose cherish\r\nWhiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,\r\nYou more invest it! Ebbing men indeed,\r\nMost often, do so near the bottom run\r\nBy their own fear or sloth.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nPrithee, say on:\r\nThe setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim\r\nA matter from thee, and a birth, indeed\r\nWhich throes thee much to yield.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nThus, sir:\r\nAlthough this lord of weak remembrance, this\r\nWho shall be of as little memory\r\nWhen he is earth’d, hath here almost persuaded,—\r\nFor he’s a spirit of persuasion, only\r\nProfesses to persuade,—the King his son’s alive,\r\n’Tis as impossible that he’s undrown’d\r\nAs he that sleeps here swims.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nI have no hope\r\nThat he’s undrown’d.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nO, out of that “no hope”\r\nWhat great hope have you! No hope that way is\r\nAnother way so high a hope, that even\r\nAmbition cannot pierce a wink beyond,\r\nBut doubts discovery there. Will you grant with me\r\nThat Ferdinand is drown’d?\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nHe’s gone.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nThen tell me,\r\nWho’s the next heir of Naples?\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nClaribel.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nShe that is Queen of Tunis; she that dwells\r\nTen leagues beyond man’s life; she that from Naples\r\nCan have no note, unless the sun were post—\r\nThe Man i’ th’ Moon’s too slow—till newborn chins\r\nBe rough and razorable; she that from whom\r\nWe all were sea-swallow’d, though some cast again,\r\nAnd by that destiny, to perform an act\r\nWhereof what’s past is prologue, what to come\r\nIn yours and my discharge.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nWhat stuff is this! How say you?\r\n’Tis true, my brother’s daughter’s Queen of Tunis;\r\nSo is she heir of Naples; ’twixt which regions\r\nThere is some space.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nA space whose ev’ry cubit\r\nSeems to cry out “How shall that Claribel\r\nMeasure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,\r\nAnd let Sebastian wake.” Say this were death\r\nThat now hath seiz’d them; why, they were no worse\r\nThan now they are. There be that can rule Naples\r\nAs well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate\r\nAs amply and unnecessarily\r\nAs this Gonzalo. I myself could make\r\nA chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore\r\nThe mind that I do! What a sleep were this\r\nFor your advancement! Do you understand me?\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nMethinks I do.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nAnd how does your content\r\nTender your own good fortune?\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nI remember\r\nYou did supplant your brother Prospero.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nTrue.\r\nAnd look how well my garments sit upon me;\r\nMuch feater than before; my brother’s servants\r\nWere then my fellows; now they are my men.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nBut, for your conscience.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nAy, sir; where lies that? If ’twere a kibe,\r\n’Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not\r\nThis deity in my bosom: twenty consciences\r\nThat stand ’twixt me and Milan, candied be they\r\nAnd melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,\r\nNo better than the earth he lies upon,\r\nIf he were that which now he’s like, that’s dead;\r\nWhom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it,\r\nCan lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,\r\nTo the perpetual wink for aye might put\r\nThis ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who\r\nShould not upbraid our course. For all the rest,\r\nThey’ll take suggestion as a cat laps milk.\r\nThey’ll tell the clock to any business that\r\nWe say befits the hour.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nThy case, dear friend,\r\nShall be my precedent: as thou got’st Milan,\r\nI’ll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke\r\nShall free thee from the tribute which thou payest,\r\nAnd I the King shall love thee.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nDraw together,\r\nAnd when I rear my hand, do you the like,\r\nTo fall it on Gonzalo.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nO, but one word.\r\n\r\n [_They converse apart._]\r\n\r\n Music. Re-enter Ariel, invisible.\r\n\r\nARIEL.\r\nMy master through his art foresees the danger\r\nThat you, his friend, are in; and sends me forth—\r\nFor else his project dies—to keep them living.\r\n\r\n[_Sings in Gonzalo’s ear._]\r\n_While you here do snoring lie,\r\nOpen-ey’d conspiracy\r\n His time doth take.\r\nIf of life you keep a care,\r\nShake off slumber, and beware.\r\n Awake! awake!_\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nThen let us both be sudden.\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nNow, good angels\r\nPreserve the King!\r\n\r\n [_They wake._]\r\n\r\nALONSO.\r\nWhy, how now! Ho, awake! Why are you drawn?\r\nWherefore this ghastly looking?\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nWhat’s the matter?\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nWhiles we stood here securing your repose,\r\nEven now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing\r\nLike bulls, or rather lions; did ’t not wake you?\r\nIt struck mine ear most terribly.\r\n\r\nALONSO.\r\nI heard nothing.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nO! ’twas a din to fright a monster’s ear,\r\nTo make an earthquake. Sure, it was the roar\r\nOf a whole herd of lions.\r\n\r\nALONSO.\r\nHeard you this, Gonzalo?\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nUpon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,\r\nAnd that a strange one too, which did awake me.\r\nI shak’d you, sir, and cried; as mine eyes open’d,\r\nI saw their weapons drawn:—there was a noise,\r\nThat’s verily. ’Tis best we stand upon our guard,\r\nOr that we quit this place: let’s draw our weapons.\r\n\r\nALONSO.\r\nLead off this ground, and let’s make further search\r\nFor my poor son.\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nHeavens keep him from these beasts!\r\nFor he is, sure, i’ th’ island.\r\n\r\nALONSO.\r\nLead away.\r\n\r\n [_Exit with the others._]\r\n\r\nARIEL.\r\nProspero my lord shall know what I have done:\r\nSo, King, go safely on to seek thy son.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. Another part of the island.\r\n\r\n Enter Caliban with a burden of wood. A noise of thunder heard.\r\n\r\nCALIBAN.\r\nAll the infections that the sun sucks up\r\nFrom bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall, and make him\r\nBy inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me,\r\nAnd yet I needs must curse. But they’ll nor pinch,\r\nFright me with urchin-shows, pitch me i’ the mire,\r\nNor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark\r\nOut of my way, unless he bid ’em; but\r\nFor every trifle are they set upon me,\r\nSometime like apes that mow and chatter at me,\r\nAnd after bite me; then like hedgehogs which\r\nLie tumbling in my barefoot way, and mount\r\nTheir pricks at my footfall; sometime am I\r\nAll wound with adders, who with cloven tongues\r\nDo hiss me into madness.\r\n\r\n Enter Trinculo.\r\n\r\nLo, now, lo!\r\nHere comes a spirit of his, and to torment me\r\nFor bringing wood in slowly. I’ll fall flat;\r\nPerchance he will not mind me.\r\n\r\nTRINCULO.\r\nHere’s neither bush nor shrub to bear off any weather at all, and\r\nanother storm brewing; I hear it sing i’ th’ wind. Yond same black\r\ncloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul bombard that would shed his\r\nliquor. If it should thunder as it did before, I know not where to hide\r\nmy head: yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by pailfuls. What have\r\nwe here? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish: he smells like a fish;\r\na very ancient and fish-like smell; a kind of not of the newest\r\nPoor-John. A strange fish! Were I in England now, as once I was, and\r\nhad but this fish painted, not a holiday fool there but would give a\r\npiece of silver: there would this monster make a man; any strange beast\r\nthere makes a man. When they will not give a doit to relieve a lame\r\nbeggar, they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian. Legg’d like a man,\r\nand his fins like arms! Warm, o’ my troth! I do now let loose my\r\nopinion, hold it no longer: this is no fish, but an islander, that hath\r\nlately suffered by thunderbolt. [_Thunder._] Alas, the storm is come\r\nagain! My best way is to creep under his gaberdine; there is no other\r\nshelter hereabout: misery acquaints a man with strange bed-fellows. I\r\nwill here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past.\r\n\r\n Enter Stephano singing; a bottle in his hand.\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\n_I shall no more to sea, to sea,\r\nHere shall I die ashore—_\r\n\r\nThis is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man’s funeral.\r\nWell, here’s my comfort.\r\n\r\n [_Drinks._]\r\n\r\n_The master, the swabber, the boatswain, and I,\r\n The gunner, and his mate,\r\nLov’d Mall, Meg, and Marian, and Margery,\r\n But none of us car’d for Kate:\r\n For she had a tongue with a tang,\r\n Would cry to a sailor “Go hang!”\r\nShe lov’d not the savour of tar nor of pitch,\r\nYet a tailor might scratch her where’er she did itch.\r\n Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang._\r\n\r\nThis is a scurvy tune too: but here’s my comfort.\r\n\r\n [_Drinks._]\r\n\r\nCALIBAN.\r\nDo not torment me: O!\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nWhat’s the matter? Have we devils here? Do you put tricks upon ’s with\r\nsavages and men of Ind? Ha? I have not scap’d drowning, to be afeard\r\nnow of your four legs; for it hath been said, As proper a man as ever\r\nwent on four legs cannot make him give ground; and it shall be said so\r\nagain, while Stephano breathes at’ nostrils.\r\n\r\nCALIBAN.\r\nThe spirit torments me: O!\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nThis is some monster of the isle with four legs, who hath got, as I\r\ntake it, an ague. Where the devil should he learn our language? I will\r\ngive him some relief, if it be but for that. If I can recover him and\r\nkeep him tame, and get to Naples with him, he’s a present for any\r\nemperor that ever trod on neat’s-leather.\r\n\r\nCALIBAN.\r\nDo not torment me, prithee; I’ll bring my wood home faster.\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nHe’s in his fit now, and does not talk after the wisest. He shall taste\r\nof my bottle: if he have never drunk wine afore, it will go near to\r\nremove his fit. If I can recover him, and keep him tame, I will not\r\ntake too much for him. He shall pay for him that hath him, and that\r\nsoundly.\r\n\r\nCALIBAN.\r\nThou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon,\r\nI know it by thy trembling: now Prosper works upon thee.\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nCome on your ways. Open your mouth; here is that which will give\r\nlanguage to you, cat. Open your mouth. This will shake your shaking, I\r\ncan tell you, and that soundly. [_gives Caliban a drink_] You cannot\r\ntell who’s your friend: open your chaps again.\r\n\r\nTRINCULO.\r\nI should know that voice: it should be—but he is drowned; and these are\r\ndevils. O, defend me!\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nFour legs and two voices; a most delicate monster! His forward voice\r\nnow is to speak well of his friend; his backward voice is to utter foul\r\nspeeches and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle will recover him,\r\nI will help his ague. Come. Amen! I will pour some in thy other mouth.\r\n\r\nTRINCULO.\r\nStephano!\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nDoth thy other mouth call me? Mercy! mercy!\r\nThis is a devil, and no monster: I will leave him; I\r\nhave no long spoon.\r\n\r\nTRINCULO.\r\nStephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me, and speak to me; for I am\r\nTrinculo—be not afeared—thy good friend Trinculo.\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nIf thou beest Trinculo, come forth. I’ll pull thee by the lesser legs:\r\nif any be Trinculo’s legs, these are they. Thou art very Trinculo\r\nindeed! How cam’st thou to be the siege of this moon-calf? Can he vent\r\nTrinculos?\r\n\r\nTRINCULO.\r\nI took him to be kill’d with a thunderstroke. But art thou not drown’d,\r\nStephano? I hope now thou are not drown’d. Is the storm overblown? I\r\nhid me under the dead moon-calf’s gaberdine for fear of the storm. And\r\nart thou living, Stephano? O Stephano, two Neapolitans scap’d!\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nPrithee, do not turn me about. My stomach is not constant.\r\n\r\nCALIBAN.\r\n[_Aside._] These be fine things, an if they be not sprites.\r\nThat’s a brave god, and bears celestial liquor.\r\nI will kneel to him.\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nHow didst thou scape? How cam’st thou hither? Swear by this bottle how\r\nthou cam’st hither—I escaped upon a butt of sack, which the sailors\r\nheaved o’erboard, by this bottle! which I made of the bark of a tree\r\nwith mine own hands, since I was cast ashore.\r\n\r\nCALIBAN.\r\nI’ll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject, for the liquor is\r\nnot earthly.\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nHere. Swear then how thou escapedst.\r\n\r\nTRINCULO.\r\nSwum ashore, man, like a duck: I can swim like a duck, I’ll be sworn.\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nHere, kiss the book. Though thou canst swim like a duck, thou art made\r\nlike a goose.\r\n\r\nTRINCULO.\r\nO Stephano, hast any more of this?\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nThe whole butt, man: my cellar is in a rock by th’ seaside, where my\r\nwine is hid. How now, moon-calf! How does thine ague?\r\n\r\nCALIBAN.\r\nHast thou not dropped from heaven?\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nOut o’ the moon, I do assure thee: I was the Man in the Moon, when time\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nCALIBAN.\r\nI have seen thee in her, and I do adore thee. My mistress showed me\r\nthee, and thy dog, and thy bush.\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nCome, swear to that. Kiss the book. I will furnish it anon with new\r\ncontents. Swear.\r\n\r\nTRINCULO.\r\nBy this good light, this is a very shallow monster. I afeard of him? A\r\nvery weak monster. The Man i’ the Moon! A most poor credulous monster!\r\nWell drawn, monster, in good sooth!\r\n\r\nCALIBAN.\r\nI’ll show thee every fertile inch o’ the island; and I will kiss thy\r\nfoot. I prithee, be my god.\r\n\r\nTRINCULO.\r\nBy this light, a most perfidious and drunken monster. When ’s god’s\r\nasleep, he’ll rob his bottle.\r\n\r\nCALIBAN.\r\nI’ll kiss thy foot. I’ll swear myself thy subject.\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nCome on, then; down, and swear.\r\n\r\nTRINCULO.\r\nI shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed monster. A most\r\nscurvy monster! I could find in my heart to beat him,—\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nCome, kiss.\r\n\r\nTRINCULO.\r\nBut that the poor monster’s in drink. An abominable monster!\r\n\r\nCALIBAN.\r\nI’ll show thee the best springs; I’ll pluck thee berries;\r\nI’ll fish for thee, and get thee wood enough.\r\nA plague upon the tyrant that I serve!\r\nI’ll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee,\r\nThou wondrous man.\r\n\r\nTRINCULO.\r\nA most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of a poor drunkard!\r\n\r\nCALIBAN.\r\nI prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow;\r\nAnd I with my long nails will dig thee pig-nuts;\r\nShow thee a jay’s nest, and instruct thee how\r\nTo snare the nimble marmoset; I’ll bring thee\r\nTo clustering filberts, and sometimes I’ll get thee\r\nYoung scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nI prithee now, lead the way without any more talking. Trinculo, the\r\nKing and all our company else being drowned, we will inherit here.\r\nHere, bear my bottle. Fellow Trinculo, we’ll fill him by and by again.\r\n\r\nCALIBAN.\r\n[_Sings drunkenly._] _Farewell, master; farewell, farewell!_\r\n\r\nTRINCULO.\r\nA howling monster, a drunken monster.\r\n\r\nCALIBAN.\r\n_No more dams I’ll make for fish;\r\nNor fetch in firing\r\nAt requiring,\r\nNor scrape trenchering, nor wash dish;\r\n’Ban ’Ban, Cacaliban,\r\nHas a new master—Get a new man._\r\nFreedom, high-day! high-day, freedom! freedom,\r\nhigh-day, freedom!\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nO brave monster! lead the way.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\nACT III\r\n\r\nSCENE I. Before Prospero’s cell.\r\n\n Enter Ferdinand bearing a log.\r\n\r\nFERDINAND.\r\nThere be some sports are painful, and their labour\r\nDelight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness\r\nAre nobly undergone; and most poor matters\r\nPoint to rich ends. This my mean task\r\nWould be as heavy to me as odious, but\r\nThe mistress which I serve quickens what’s dead,\r\nAnd makes my labours pleasures: O, she is\r\nTen times more gentle than her father’s crabbed,\r\nAnd he’s compos’d of harshness. I must remove\r\nSome thousands of these logs, and pile them up,\r\nUpon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress\r\nWeeps when she sees me work, and says such baseness\r\nHad never like executor. I forget:\r\nBut these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,\r\nMost busy, least when I do it.\r\n\r\n Enter Miranda and Prospero behind.\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\nAlas now, pray you,\r\nWork not so hard: I would the lightning had\r\nBurnt up those logs that you are enjoin’d to pile!\r\nPray, set it down and rest you. When this burns,\r\n’Twill weep for having wearied you. My father\r\nIs hard at study; pray, now, rest yourself:\r\nHe’s safe for these three hours.\r\n\r\nFERDINAND.\r\nO most dear mistress,\r\nThe sun will set, before I shall discharge\r\nWhat I must strive to do.\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\nIf you’ll sit down,\r\nI’ll bear your logs the while. Pray give me that;\r\nI’ll carry it to the pile.\r\n\r\nFERDINAND.\r\nNo, precious creature;\r\nI had rather crack my sinews, break my back,\r\nThan you should such dishonour undergo,\r\nWhile I sit lazy by.\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\nIt would become me\r\nAs well as it does you: and I should do it\r\nWith much more ease; for my good will is to it,\r\nAnd yours it is against.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\n[_Aside._] Poor worm! thou art infected.\r\nThis visitation shows it.\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\nYou look wearily.\r\n\r\nFERDINAND.\r\nNo, noble mistress; ’tis fresh morning with me\r\nWhen you are by at night. I do beseech you—\r\nChiefly that I might set it in my prayers—\r\nWhat is your name?\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\nMiranda—O my father!\r\nI have broke your hest to say so.\r\n\r\nFERDINAND.\r\nAdmir’d Miranda!\r\nIndeed, the top of admiration; worth\r\nWhat’s dearest to the world! Full many a lady\r\nI have ey’d with best regard, and many a time\r\nTh’ harmony of their tongues hath into bondage\r\nBrought my too diligent ear: for several virtues\r\nHave I lik’d several women; never any\r\nWith so full soul but some defect in her\r\nDid quarrel with the noblest grace she ow’d,\r\nAnd put it to the foil: but you, O you,\r\nSo perfect and so peerless, are created\r\nOf every creature’s best.\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\nI do not know\r\nOne of my sex; no woman’s face remember,\r\nSave, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen\r\nMore that I may call men than you, good friend,\r\nAnd my dear father: how features are abroad,\r\nI am skilless of; but, by my modesty,\r\nThe jewel in my dower, I would not wish\r\nAny companion in the world but you;\r\nNor can imagination form a shape,\r\nBesides yourself, to like of. But I prattle\r\nSomething too wildly, and my father’s precepts\r\nI therein do forget.\r\n\r\nFERDINAND.\r\nI am, in my condition,\r\nA prince, Miranda; I do think, a King;\r\nI would not so!—and would no more endure\r\nThis wooden slavery than to suffer\r\nThe flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:\r\nThe very instant that I saw you, did\r\nMy heart fly to your service; there resides,\r\nTo make me slave to it; and for your sake\r\nAm I this patient log-man.\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\nDo you love me?\r\n\r\nFERDINAND.\r\nO heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound,\r\nAnd crown what I profess with kind event,\r\nIf I speak true; if hollowly, invert\r\nWhat best is boded me to mischief! I,\r\nBeyond all limit of what else i’ the world,\r\nDo love, prize, honour you.\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\nI am a fool\r\nTo weep at what I am glad of.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\n[_Aside._] Fair encounter\r\nOf two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace\r\nOn that which breeds between ’em!\r\n\r\nFERDINAND.\r\nWherefore weep you?\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\nAt mine unworthiness, that dare not offer\r\nWhat I desire to give; and much less take\r\nWhat I shall die to want. But this is trifling;\r\nAnd all the more it seeks to hide itself,\r\nThe bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning!\r\nAnd prompt me, plain and holy innocence!\r\nI am your wife if you will marry me;\r\nIf not, I’ll die your maid: to be your fellow\r\nYou may deny me; but I’ll be your servant,\r\nWhether you will or no.\r\n\r\nFERDINAND.\r\nMy mistress, dearest;\r\nAnd I thus humble ever.\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\nMy husband, then?\r\n\r\nFERDINAND.\r\nAy, with a heart as willing\r\nAs bondage e’er of freedom: here’s my hand.\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\nAnd mine, with my heart in ’t: and now farewell\r\nTill half an hour hence.\r\n\r\nFERDINAND.\r\nA thousand thousand!\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Ferdinand and Miranda severally._]\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nSo glad of this as they, I cannot be,\r\nWho are surpris’d withal; but my rejoicing\r\nAt nothing can be more. I’ll to my book;\r\nFor yet, ere supper time, must I perform\r\nMuch business appertaining.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. Another part of the island.\r\n\r\n Enter Caliban with a bottle, Stephano and Trinculo.\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nTell not me:—when the butt is out we will drink water; not a drop\r\nbefore: therefore bear up, and board ’em. Servant-monster, drink to me.\r\n\r\nTRINCULO.\r\nServant-monster! The folly of this island! They say there’s but five\r\nupon this isle; we are three of them; if th’ other two be brained like\r\nus, the state totters.\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nDrink, servant-monster, when I bid thee: thy eyes are almost set in thy\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nTRINCULO.\r\nWhere should they be set else? He were a brave monster indeed, if they\r\nwere set in his tail.\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nMy man-monster hath drown’d his tongue in sack: for my part, the sea\r\ncannot drown me; I swam, ere I could recover the shore, five-and-thirty\r\nleagues, off and on, by this light. Thou shalt be my lieutenant,\r\nmonster, or my standard.\r\n\r\nTRINCULO.\r\nYour lieutenant, if you list; he’s no standard.\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nWe’ll not run, Monsieur monster.\r\n\r\nTRINCULO.\r\nNor go neither. But you’ll lie like dogs, and yet say nothing neither.\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nMoon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a good moon-calf.\r\n\r\nCALIBAN.\r\nHow does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe. I’ll not serve him, he is\r\nnot valiant.\r\n\r\nTRINCULO.\r\nThou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case to justle a constable.\r\nWhy, thou deboshed fish thou, was there ever man a coward that hath\r\ndrunk so much sack as I today? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie, being\r\nbut half a fish and half a monster?\r\n\r\nCALIBAN.\r\nLo, how he mocks me! wilt thou let him, my lord?\r\n\r\nTRINCULO.\r\n“Lord” quoth he! That a monster should be such a natural!\r\n\r\nCALIBAN.\r\nLo, lo again! bite him to death, I prithee.\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nTrinculo, keep a good tongue in your head: if you prove a mutineer, the\r\nnext tree! The poor monster’s my subject, and he shall not suffer\r\nindignity.\r\n\r\nCALIBAN.\r\nI thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleas’d to hearken once again to\r\nthe suit I made to thee?\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nMarry. will I. Kneel and repeat it. I will stand, and so shall\r\nTrinculo.\r\n\r\n Enter Ariel, invisible.\r\n\r\nCALIBAN.\r\nAs I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant, a sorcerer, that by\r\nhis cunning hath cheated me of the island.\r\n\r\nARIEL.\r\nThou liest.\r\n\r\nCALIBAN.\r\nThou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou;\r\nI would my valiant master would destroy thee;\r\nI do not lie.\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nTrinculo, if you trouble him any more in his tale, by this hand, I will\r\nsupplant some of your teeth.\r\n\r\nTRINCULO.\r\nWhy, I said nothing.\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nMum, then, and no more. Proceed.\r\n\r\nCALIBAN.\r\nI say, by sorcery he got this isle;\r\nFrom me he got it. If thy greatness will,\r\nRevenge it on him,—for I know thou dar’st;\r\nBut this thing dare not,—\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nThat’s most certain.\r\n\r\nCALIBAN.\r\nThou shalt be lord of it and I’ll serve thee.\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nHow now shall this be compassed? Canst thou bring me to the party?\r\n\r\nCALIBAN.\r\nYea, yea, my lord: I’ll yield him thee asleep,\r\nWhere thou mayst knock a nail into his head.\r\n\r\nARIEL.\r\nThou liest. Thou canst not.\r\n\r\nCALIBAN.\r\nWhat a pied ninny’s this! Thou scurvy patch!\r\nI do beseech thy greatness, give him blows,\r\nAnd take his bottle from him: when that’s gone\r\nHe shall drink nought but brine; for I’ll not show him\r\nWhere the quick freshes are.\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nTrinculo, run into no further danger: interrupt the monster one word\r\nfurther, and by this hand, I’ll turn my mercy out o’ doors, and make a\r\nstock-fish of thee.\r\n\r\nTRINCULO.\r\nWhy, what did I? I did nothing. I’ll go farther off.\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nDidst thou not say he lied?\r\n\r\nARIEL.\r\nThou liest.\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nDo I so?

Remember\r\nFirst to possess his books; for without them\r\nHe’s but a sot, as I am, nor hath not\r\nOne spirit to command: they all do hate him\r\nAs rootedly as I. Burn but his books.\r\nHe has brave utensils,—for so he calls them,—\r\nWhich, when he has a house, he’ll deck withal.\r\nAnd that most deeply to consider is\r\nThe beauty of his daughter; he himself\r\nCalls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman\r\nBut only Sycorax my dam and she;\r\nBut she as far surpasseth Sycorax\r\nAs great’st does least.\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nIs it so brave a lass?\r\n\r\nCALIBAN.\r\nAy, lord, she will become thy bed, I warrant,\r\nAnd bring thee forth brave brood.\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nMonster, I will kill this man. His daughter and I will be king and\r\nqueen,—save our graces!—and Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys.\r\nDost thou like the plot, Trinculo?\r\n\r\nTRINCULO.\r\nExcellent.\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nGive me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee; but while thou liv’st, keep a\r\ngood tongue in thy head.\r\n\r\nCALIBAN.\r\nWithin this half hour will he be asleep.\r\nWilt thou destroy him then?\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nAy, on mine honour.\r\n\r\nARIEL.\r\nThis will I tell my master.\r\n\r\nCALIBAN.\r\nThou mak’st me merry. I am full of pleasure.\r\nLet us be jocund: will you troll the catch\r\nYou taught me but while-ere?\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nAt thy request, monster, I will do reason, any reason.

Since they did plot\r\nThe means that dusky Dis my daughter got,\r\nHer and her blind boy’s scandal’d company\r\nI have forsworn.\r\n\r\nIRIS.\r\nOf her society\r\nBe not afraid. I met her deity\r\nCutting the clouds towards Paphos, and her son\r\nDove-drawn with her.

There’s another garment for ’t.\r\n\r\nTRINCULO.\r\nMonster, come, put some lime upon your fingers, and away with the rest.\r\n\r\nCALIBAN.\r\nI will have none on’t. We shall lose our time,\r\nAnd all be turn’d to barnacles, or to apes\r\nWith foreheads villainous low.\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nMonster, lay-to your fingers: help to bear this away where my hogshead\r\nof wine is, or I’ll turn you out of my kingdom. Go to, carry this.\r\n\r\nTRINCULO.\r\nAnd this.\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nAy, and this.\r\n\r\n A noise of hunters heard. Enter divers Spirits, in shape of dogs and\r\n hounds, and hunt them about; Prospero and Ariel setting them on.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nHey, Mountain, hey!\r\n\r\nARIEL.\r\nSilver! there it goes, Silver!\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nFury, Fury! There, Tyrant, there! hark, hark!\r\n\r\n [_Caliban, Stephano and Trinculo are driven out._]\r\n\r\nGo, charge my goblins that they grind their joints\r\nWith dry convulsions; shorten up their sinews\r\nWith aged cramps, and more pinch-spotted make them\r\nThan pard, or cat o’ mountain.\r\n\r\nARIEL.\r\nHark, they roar.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nLet them be hunted soundly. At this hour\r\nLies at my mercy all mine enemies.\r\nShortly shall all my labours end, and thou\r\nShalt have the air at freedom. For a little\r\nFollow, and do me service.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\nACT V\r\n\r\nSCENE I. Before the cell of Prospero.\r\n\n Enter Prospero in his magic robes, and Ariel.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nNow does my project gather to a head:\r\nMy charms crack not; my spirits obey, and time\r\nGoes upright with his carriage. How’s the day?\r\n\r\nARIEL.\r\nOn the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,\r\nYou said our work should cease.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nI did say so,\r\nWhen first I rais’d the tempest. Say, my spirit,\r\nHow fares the King and ’s followers?\r\n\r\nARIEL.\r\nConfin’d together\r\nIn the same fashion as you gave in charge,\r\nJust as you left them; all prisoners, sir,\r\nIn the line grove which weather-fends your cell;\r\nThey cannot budge till your release. The King,\r\nHis brother, and yours, abide all three distracted,\r\nAnd the remainder mourning over them,\r\nBrimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly\r\nHim you term’d, sir, “the good old lord, Gonzalo”.\r\nHis tears run down his beard, like winter’s drops\r\nFrom eaves of reeds; your charm so strongly works ’em,\r\nThat if you now beheld them, your affections\r\nWould become tender.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nDost thou think so, spirit?\r\n\r\nARIEL.\r\nMine would, sir, were I human.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nAnd mine shall.\r\nHast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling\r\nOf their afflictions, and shall not myself,\r\nOne of their kind, that relish all as sharply\r\nPassion as they, be kindlier mov’d than thou art?\r\nThough with their high wrongs I am struck to th’ quick,\r\nYet with my nobler reason ’gainst my fury\r\nDo I take part: the rarer action is\r\nIn virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,\r\nThe sole drift of my purpose doth extend\r\nNot a frown further. Go release them, Ariel.\r\nMy charms I’ll break, their senses I’ll restore,\r\nAnd they shall be themselves.\r\n\r\nARIEL.\r\nI’ll fetch them, sir.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nYe elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and\r\ngroves;\r\nAnd ye that on the sands with printless foot\r\nDo chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him\r\nWhen he comes back; you demi-puppets that\r\nBy moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,\r\nWhereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime\r\nIs to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice\r\nTo hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,\r\nWeak masters though ye be, I have bedimm’d\r\nThe noontide sun, call’d forth the mutinous winds,\r\nAnd ’twixt the green sea and the azur’d vault\r\nSet roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder\r\nHave I given fire, and rifted Jove’s stout oak\r\nWith his own bolt; the strong-bas’d promontory\r\nHave I made shake, and by the spurs pluck’d up\r\nThe pine and cedar: graves at my command\r\nHave wak’d their sleepers, op’d, and let ’em forth\r\nBy my so potent art. But this rough magic\r\nI here abjure; and, when I have requir’d\r\nSome heavenly music,—which even now I do,—\r\nTo work mine end upon their senses that\r\nThis airy charm is for, I’ll break my staff,\r\nBury it certain fathoms in the earth,\r\nAnd deeper than did ever plummet sound\r\nI’ll drown my book.\r\n\r\n [_Solemn music._]\r\n\r\n Re-enter Ariel: after him, Alonso with a frantic gesture, attended by\r\n Gonzalo, Sebastian and Antonio in like manner, attended by Adrian and\r\n Francisco: they all enter the circle which Prospero had made, and\r\n there stand charmed; which Prospero observing, speaks.\r\n\r\nA solemn air, and the best comforter\r\nTo an unsettled fancy, cure thy brains,\r\nNow useless, boil’d within thy skull! There stand,\r\nFor you are spell-stopp’d.\r\nHoly Gonzalo, honourable man,\r\nMine eyes, e’en sociable to the show of thine,\r\nFall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace;\r\nAnd as the morning steals upon the night,\r\nMelting the darkness, so their rising senses\r\nBegin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle\r\nTheir clearer reason. O good Gonzalo!\r\nMy true preserver, and a loyal sir\r\nTo him thou follow’st, I will pay thy graces\r\nHome, both in word and deed. Most cruelly\r\nDidst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:\r\nThy brother was a furtherer in the act.\r\nThou art pinch’d for ’t now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,\r\nYou, brother mine, that entertain’d ambition,\r\nExpell’d remorse and nature, who, with Sebastian,—\r\nWhose inward pinches therefore are most strong,\r\nWould here have kill’d your King; I do forgive thee,\r\nUnnatural though thou art. Their understanding\r\nBegins to swell, and the approaching tide\r\nWill shortly fill the reasonable shores\r\nThat now lie foul and muddy. Not one of them\r\nThat yet looks on me, or would know me. Ariel,\r\nFetch me the hat and rapier in my cell.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Ariel._]\r\n\r\nI will discase me, and myself present\r\nAs I was sometime Milan. Quickly, spirit;\r\nThou shalt ere long be free.\r\n\r\n Ariel re-enters, singing, and helps to attire Prospero.\r\n\r\nARIEL\r\n_Where the bee sucks, there suck I:\r\nIn a cowslip’s bell I lie;\r\nThere I couch when owls do cry.\r\nOn the bat’s back I do fly\r\nAfter summer merrily.\r\nMerrily, merrily shall I live now\r\nUnder the blossom that hangs on the bough._\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nWhy, that’s my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee;\r\nBut yet thou shalt have freedom; so, so, so.\r\nTo the King’s ship, invisible as thou art:\r\nThere shalt thou find the mariners asleep\r\nUnder the hatches; the master and the boatswain\r\nBeing awake, enforce them to this place,\r\nAnd presently, I prithee.\r\n\r\nARIEL.\r\nI drink the air before me, and return\r\nOr ere your pulse twice beat.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nAll torment, trouble, wonder and amazement\r\nInhabits here. Some heavenly power guide us\r\nOut of this fearful country!\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nBehold, sir King,\r\nThe wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero.\r\nFor more assurance that a living prince\r\nDoes now speak to thee, I embrace thy body;\r\nAnd to thee and thy company I bid\r\nA hearty welcome.\r\n\r\nALONSO.\r\nWhe’er thou be’st he or no,\r\nOr some enchanted trifle to abuse me,\r\nAs late I have been, I not know: thy pulse\r\nBeats, as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,\r\nTh’ affliction of my mind amends, with which,\r\nI fear, a madness held me: this must crave,\r\nAn if this be at all, a most strange story.\r\nThy dukedom I resign, and do entreat\r\nThou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero\r\nBe living and be here?\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nFirst, noble friend,\r\nLet me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot\r\nBe measur’d or confin’d.\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nWhether this be\r\nOr be not, I’ll not swear.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nYou do yet taste\r\nSome subtleties o’ the isle, that will not let you\r\nBelieve things certain. Welcome, my friends all.\r\n[_Aside to Sebastian and Antonio._] But you, my brace of lords, were I\r\nso minded,\r\nI here could pluck his highness’ frown upon you,\r\nAnd justify you traitors: at this time\r\nI will tell no tales.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\n[_Aside._] The devil speaks in him.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nNo.\r\nFor you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother\r\nWould even infect my mouth, I do forgive\r\nThy rankest fault, all of them; and require\r\nMy dukedom of thee, which perforce I know\r\nThou must restore.\r\n\r\nALONSO.\r\nIf thou beest Prospero,\r\nGive us particulars of thy preservation;\r\nHow thou hast met us here, whom three hours since\r\nWere wrack’d upon this shore; where I have lost,—\r\nHow sharp the point of this remembrance is!—\r\nMy dear son Ferdinand.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nI am woe for ’t, sir.\r\n\r\nALONSO.\r\nIrreparable is the loss, and patience\r\nSays it is past her cure.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nI rather think\r\nYou have not sought her help, of whose soft grace,\r\nFor the like loss I have her sovereign aid,\r\nAnd rest myself content.\r\n\r\nALONSO.\r\nYou the like loss!\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nAs great to me, as late; and, supportable\r\nTo make the dear loss, have I means much weaker\r\nThan you may call to comfort you, for I\r\nHave lost my daughter.\r\n\r\nALONSO.\r\nA daughter?\r\nO heavens, that they were living both in Naples,\r\nThe King and Queen there! That they were, I wish\r\nMyself were mudded in that oozy bed\r\nWhere my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nIn this last tempest. I perceive, these lords\r\nAt this encounter do so much admire\r\nThat they devour their reason, and scarce think\r\nTheir eyes do offices of truth, their words\r\nAre natural breath; but, howsoe’er you have\r\nBeen justled from your senses, know for certain\r\nThat I am Prospero, and that very duke\r\nWhich was thrust forth of Milan; who most strangely\r\nUpon this shore, where you were wrack’d, was landed\r\nTo be the lord on’t. No more yet of this;\r\nFor ’tis a chronicle of day by day,\r\nNot a relation for a breakfast nor\r\nBefitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir.\r\nThis cell’s my court: here have I few attendants,\r\nAnd subjects none abroad: pray you, look in.\r\nMy dukedom since you have given me again,\r\nI will requite you with as good a thing;\r\nAt least bring forth a wonder, to content ye\r\nAs much as me my dukedom.\r\n\r\nHere Prospero discovers Ferdinand and Miranda playing at chess.\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\nSweet lord, you play me false.\r\n\r\nFERDINAND.\r\nNo, my dearest love,\r\nI would not for the world.\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\nYes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,\r\nAnd I would call it fair play.\r\n\r\nALONSO.\r\nIf this prove\r\nA vision of the island, one dear son\r\nShall I twice lose.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nA most high miracle!\r\n\r\nFERDINAND.\r\nThough the seas threaten, they are merciful.\r\nI have curs’d them without cause.\r\n\r\n [_Kneels to Alonso._]\r\n\r\nALONSO.\r\nNow all the blessings\r\nOf a glad father compass thee about!\r\nArise, and say how thou cam’st here.\r\n\r\nMIRANDA.\r\nO, wonder!\r\nHow many goodly creatures are there here!\r\nHow beauteous mankind is! O brave new world\r\nThat has such people in ’t!\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\n’Tis new to thee.\r\n\r\nALONSO.\r\nWhat is this maid, with whom thou wast at play?\r\nYour eld’st acquaintance cannot be three hours:\r\nIs she the goddess that hath sever’d us,\r\nAnd brought us thus together?\r\n\r\nFERDINAND.\r\nSir, she is mortal;\r\nBut by immortal Providence she’s mine.\r\nI chose her when I could not ask my father\r\nFor his advice, nor thought I had one. She\r\nIs daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,\r\nOf whom so often I have heard renown,\r\nBut never saw before; of whom I have\r\nReceiv’d a second life; and second father\r\nThis lady makes him to me.\r\n\r\nALONSO.\r\nI am hers:\r\nBut, O, how oddly will it sound that I\r\nMust ask my child forgiveness!\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nThere, sir, stop:\r\nLet us not burden our remembrances with\r\nA heaviness that’s gone.\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nI have inly wept,\r\nOr should have spoke ere this. Look down, you gods,\r\nAnd on this couple drop a blessed crown;\r\nFor it is you that have chalk’d forth the way\r\nWhich brought us hither.\r\n\r\nALONSO.\r\nI say, Amen, Gonzalo!\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nWas Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue\r\nShould become Kings of Naples? O, rejoice\r\nBeyond a common joy, and set it down\r\nWith gold on lasting pillars: in one voyage\r\nDid Claribel her husband find at Tunis,\r\nAnd Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife\r\nWhere he himself was lost; Prospero his dukedom\r\nIn a poor isle; and all of us ourselves,\r\nWhen no man was his own.\r\n\r\nALONSO.\r\n[_To Ferdinand and Miranda._] Give me your hands:\r\nLet grief and sorrow still embrace his heart\r\nThat doth not wish you joy!\r\n\r\nGONZALO.\r\nBe it so. Amen!\r\n\r\n Re-enter Ariel with the Master and Boatswain amazedly following.\r\n\r\nO look, sir, look, sir! Here are more of us.\r\nI prophesied, if a gallows were on land,\r\nThis fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,\r\nThat swear’st grace o’erboard, not an oath on shore?\r\nHast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?\r\n\r\nBOATSWAIN.\r\nThe best news is that we have safely found\r\nOur King and company. The next, our ship,—\r\nWhich but three glasses since, we gave out split,\r\nIs tight and yare, and bravely rigg’d as when\r\nWe first put out to sea.\r\n\r\nARIEL.\r\n[_Aside to Prospero._] Sir, all this service\r\nHave I done since I went.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\n[_Aside to Ariel._] My tricksy spirit!\r\n\r\nALONSO.\r\nThese are not natural events; they strengthen\r\nFrom strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?\r\n\r\nBOATSWAIN.\r\nIf I did think, sir, I were well awake,\r\nI’d strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,\r\nAnd,—how, we know not,—all clapp’d under hatches,\r\nWhere, but even now, with strange and several noises\r\nOf roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,\r\nAnd mo diversity of sounds, all horrible,\r\nWe were awak’d; straightway, at liberty:\r\nWhere we, in all her trim, freshly beheld\r\nOur royal, good, and gallant ship; our master\r\nCap’ring to eye her. On a trice, so please you,\r\nEven in a dream, were we divided from them,\r\nAnd were brought moping hither.\r\n\r\nARIEL.\r\n[_Aside to Prospero._] Was’t well done?\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\n[_Aside to Ariel._] Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free.\r\n\r\nALONSO.\r\nThis is as strange a maze as e’er men trod;\r\nAnd there is in this business more than nature\r\nWas ever conduct of: some oracle\r\nMust rectify our knowledge.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nSir, my liege,\r\nDo not infest your mind with beating on\r\nThe strangeness of this business. At pick’d leisure,\r\nWhich shall be shortly, single I’ll resolve you,\r\nWhich to you shall seem probable, of every\r\nThese happen’d accidents; till when, be cheerful\r\nAnd think of each thing well. [_Aside to Ariel._] Come hither, spirit;\r\nSet Caliban and his companions free;\r\nUntie the spell.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Ariel._]\r\n\r\n How fares my gracious sir?\r\nThere are yet missing of your company\r\nSome few odd lads that you remember not.\r\n\r\n Re-enter Ariel driving in Caliban, Stephano and Trinculo in their\r\n stolen apparel.\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nEvery man shift for all the rest, and let no man take care for himself,\r\nfor all is but fortune.—Coragio! bully-monster, coragio!\r\n\r\nTRINCULO.\r\nIf these be true spies which I wear in my head, here’s a goodly sight.\r\n\r\nCALIBAN.\r\nO Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed.\r\nHow fine my master is! I am afraid\r\nHe will chastise me.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nHa, ha!\r\nWhat things are these, my lord Antonio?\r\nWill money buy them?\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nVery like; one of them\r\nIs a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nMark but the badges of these men, my lords,\r\nThen say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave,\r\nHis mother was a witch; and one so strong\r\nThat could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,\r\nAnd deal in her command without her power.\r\nThese three have robb’d me; and this demi-devil,\r\nFor he’s a bastard one, had plotted with them\r\nTo take my life. Two of these fellows you\r\nMust know and own; this thing of darkness I\r\nAcknowledge mine.\r\n\r\nCALIBAN.\r\nI shall be pinch’d to death.\r\n\r\nALONSO.\r\nIs not this Stephano, my drunken butler?\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nHe is drunk now: where had he wine?\r\n\r\nALONSO.\r\nAnd Trinculo is reeling-ripe: where should they\r\nFind this grand liquor that hath gilded ’em?\r\nHow cam’st thou in this pickle?\r\n\r\nTRINCULO.\r\nI have been in such a pickle since I saw you last that, I fear me, will\r\nnever out of my bones. I shall not fear fly-blowing.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nWhy, how now, Stephano!\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nO! touch me not. I am not Stephano, but a cramp.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nYou’d be King o’ the isle, sirrah?\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO.\r\nI should have been a sore one, then.\r\n\r\nALONSO.\r\nThis is as strange a thing as e’er I look’d on.\r\n\r\n [_Pointing to Caliban._]\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nHe is as disproportioned in his manners\r\nAs in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell;\r\nTake with you your companions. As you look\r\nTo have my pardon, trim it handsomely.\r\n\r\nCALIBAN.\r\nAy, that I will; and I’ll be wise hereafter,\r\nAnd seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass\r\nWas I, to take this drunkard for a god,\r\nAnd worship this dull fool!\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nGo to; away!\r\n\r\nALONSO.\r\nHence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nOr stole it, rather.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Caliban, Stephano and Trinculo._]\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nSir, I invite your Highness and your train\r\nTo my poor cell, where you shall take your rest\r\nFor this one night; which, part of it, I’ll waste\r\nWith such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it\r\nGo quick away: the story of my life\r\nAnd the particular accidents gone by\r\nSince I came to this isle: and in the morn\r\nI’ll bring you to your ship, and so to Naples,\r\nWhere I have hope to see the nuptial\r\nOf these our dear-belov’d solemnized;\r\nAnd thence retire me to my Milan, where\r\nEvery third thought shall be my grave.\r\n\r\nALONSO.\r\nI long\r\nTo hear the story of your life, which must\r\nTake the ear strangely.\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nI’ll deliver all;\r\nAnd promise you calm seas, auspicious gales,\r\nAnd sail so expeditious that shall catch\r\nYour royal fleet far off. [_Aside to Ariel._] My Ariel,\r\nchick,\r\nThat is thy charge: then to the elements\r\nBe free, and fare thou well! Please you, draw near.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE\r\n\r\nPROSPERO.\r\nNow my charms are all o’erthrown,\r\nAnd what strength I have’s mine own,\r\nWhich is most faint. Now ’tis true,\r\nI must be here confin’d by you,\r\nOr sent to Naples. Let me not,\r\nSince I have my dukedom got,\r\nAnd pardon’d the deceiver, dwell\r\nIn this bare island by your spell,\r\nBut release me from my bands\r\nWith the help of your good hands.\r\nGentle breath of yours my sails\r\nMust fill, or else my project fails,\r\nWhich was to please. Now I want\r\nSpirits to enforce, art to enchant;\r\nAnd my ending is despair,\r\nUnless I be reliev’d by prayer,\r\nWhich pierces so that it assaults\r\nMercy itself, and frees all faults.\r\n As you from crimes would pardon’d be,\r\n Let your indulgence set me free.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\nTHE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS\r\n\nContents\r\n\r\n ACT I\r\n Scene I.

Here is a water, look ye.\r\n\r\nPAINTER.\r\nYou are rapt, sir, in some work, some dedication\r\nTo the great lord.\r\n\r\nPOET.\r\nA thing slipped idly from me.\r\nOur poesy is as a gum which oozes\r\nFrom whence ’tis nourished. The fire i’ th’ flint\r\nShows not till it be struck; our gentle flame\r\nProvokes itself and, like the current, flies\r\nEach bound it chases. What have you there?\r\n\r\nPAINTER.\r\nA picture, sir. When comes your book forth?\r\n\r\nPOET.\r\nUpon the heels of my presentment, sir.\r\nLet’s see your piece.\r\n\r\nPAINTER.\r\n’Tis a good piece.\r\n\r\nPOET.\r\nSo ’tis. This comes off well and excellent.\r\n\r\nPAINTER.\r\nIndifferent.\r\n\r\nPOET.\r\nAdmirable! How this grace\r\nSpeaks his own standing! What a mental power\r\nThis eye shoots forth! How big imagination\r\nMoves in this lip! To th’ dumbness of the gesture\r\nOne might interpret.\r\n\r\nPAINTER.\r\nIt is a pretty mocking of the life.\r\nHere is a touch. Is’t good?\r\n\r\nPOET.\r\nI’ll say of it,\r\nIt tutors nature. Artificial strife\r\nLives in these touches livelier than life.\r\n\r\nEnter certain Senators, who pass over the stage.\r\n\r\nPAINTER.\r\nHow this lord is followed!\r\n\r\nPOET.\r\nThe senators of Athens, happy men!\r\n\r\nPAINTER.\r\nLook, more!\r\n\r\nPOET.\r\nYou see this confluence, this great flood of visitors.\r\nI have in this rough work shaped out a man\r\nWhom this beneath world doth embrace and hug\r\nWith amplest entertainment. My free drift\r\nHalts not particularly, but moves itself\r\nIn a wide sea of wax. No levelled malice\r\nInfects one comma in the course I hold,\r\nBut flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,\r\nLeaving no tract behind.\r\n\r\nPAINTER.\r\nHow shall I understand you?\r\n\r\nPOET.\r\nI will unbolt to you.\r\nYou see how all conditions, how all minds,\r\nAs well of glib and slipp’ry creatures as\r\nOf grave and austere quality, tender down\r\nTheir services to Lord Timon. His large fortune,\r\nUpon his good and gracious nature hanging,\r\nSubdues and properties to his love and tendance\r\nAll sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-faced flatterer\r\nTo Apemantus, that few things loves better\r\nThan to abhor himself; even he drops down\r\nThe knee before him and returns in peace\r\nMost rich in Timon’s nod.\r\n\r\nPAINTER.\r\nI saw them speak together.\r\n\r\nPOET.\r\nSir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill\r\nFeigned Fortune to be throned. The base o’ th’ mount\r\nIs ranked with all deserts, all kind of natures\r\nThat labour on the bosom of this sphere\r\nTo propagate their states. Amongst them all\r\nWhose eyes are on this sovereign lady fixed,\r\nOne do I personate of Lord Timon’s frame,\r\nWhom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her,\r\nWhose present grace to present slaves and servants\r\nTranslates his rivals.\r\n\r\nPAINTER.\r\n’Tis conceived to scope.\r\nThis throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,\r\nWith one man beckoned from the rest below,\r\nBowing his head against the steepy mount\r\nTo climb his happiness, would be well expressed\r\nIn our condition.\r\n\r\nPOET.\r\nNay, sir, but hear me on.\r\nAll those which were his fellows but of late,\r\nSome better than his value, on the moment\r\nFollow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance,\r\nRain sacrificial whisperings in his ear,\r\nMake sacred even his stirrup, and through him\r\nDrink the free air.\r\n\r\nPAINTER.\r\nAy, marry, what of these?\r\n\r\nPOET.\r\nWhen Fortune in her shift and change of mood\r\nSpurns down her late beloved, all his dependants,\r\nWhich laboured after him to the mountain’s top\r\nEven on their knees and hands, let him slip down,\r\nNot one accompanying his declining foot.\r\n\r\nPAINTER.\r\n’Tis common.\r\nA thousand moral paintings I can show\r\nThat shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune’s\r\nMore pregnantly than words. Yet you do well\r\nTo show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen\r\nThe foot above the head.\r\n\r\nTrumpets sound. Enter Lord Timon, addressing himself courteously to\r\nevery suitor. He is accompanied by a Messenger; Lucilius and other\r\nservants follow.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nImprisoned is he, say you?\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nAy, my good lord. Five talents is his debt,\r\nHis means most short, his creditors most strait.\r\nYour honourable letter he desires\r\nTo those have shut him up, which, failing,\r\nPeriods his comfort.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nNoble Ventidius. Well,\r\nI am not of that feather to shake off\r\nMy friend when he must need me. I do know him\r\nA gentleman that well deserves a help,\r\nWhich he shall have. I’ll pay the debt and free him.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nYour lordship ever binds him.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nCommend me to him, I will send his ransom;\r\nAnd, being enfranchised, bid him come to me.\r\n’Tis not enough to help the feeble up,\r\nBut to support him after. Fare you well.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nAll happiness to your honour.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nEnter an Old Athenian.\r\n\r\nOLD ATHENIAN.\r\nLord Timon, hear me speak.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nFreely, good father.\r\n\r\nOLD ATHENIAN.\r\nThou hast a servant named Lucilius.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nI have so. What of him?\r\n\r\nOLD ATHENIAN.\r\nMost noble Timon, call the man before thee.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nAttends he here or no? Lucilius!\r\n\r\nLUCILIUS.\r\nHere, at your lordship’s service.\r\n\r\nOLD ATHENIAN.\r\nThis fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature,\r\nBy night frequents my house. I am a man\r\nThat from my first have been inclined to thrift,\r\nAnd my estate deserves an heir more raised\r\nThan one which holds a trencher.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nWell, what further?\r\n\r\nOLD ATHENIAN.\r\nOne only daughter have I, no kin else,\r\nOn whom I may confer what I have got.\r\nThe maid is fair, o’ th’ youngest for a bride,\r\nAnd I have bred her at my dearest cost\r\nIn qualities of the best. This man of thine\r\nAttempts her love. I prithee, noble lord,\r\nJoin with me to forbid him her resort;\r\nMyself have spoke in vain.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nThe man is honest.\r\n\r\nOLD ATHENIAN.\r\nTherefore he will be, Timon.\r\nHis honesty rewards him in itself;\r\nIt must not bear my daughter.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nDoes she love him?\r\n\r\nOLD ATHENIAN.\r\nShe is young and apt.\r\nOur own precedent passions do instruct us\r\nWhat levity’s in youth.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\n[_To Lucilius_.] Love you the maid?\r\n\r\nLUCILIUS.\r\nAy, my good lord, and she accepts of it.\r\n\r\nOLD ATHENIAN.\r\nIf in her marriage my consent be missing,\r\nI call the gods to witness, I will choose\r\nMine heir from forth the beggars of the world\r\nAnd dispossess her all.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nHow shall she be endowed,\r\nIf she be mated with an equal husband?\r\n\r\nOLD ATHENIAN.\r\nThree talents on the present; in future, all.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nThis gentleman of mine hath served me long.\r\nTo build his fortune I will strain a little,\r\nFor ’tis a bond in men. Give him thy daughter.\r\nWhat you bestow, in him I’ll counterpoise,\r\nAnd make him weigh with her.\r\n\r\nOLD ATHENIAN.\r\nMost noble lord,\r\nPawn me to this your honour, she is his.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nMy hand to thee; mine honour on my promise.\r\n\r\nLUCILIUS.\r\nHumbly I thank your lordship. Never may\r\nThat state or fortune fall into my keeping\r\nWhich is not owed to you.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Lucilius and Old Athenian._]\r\n\r\nPOET.\r\n[_Presenting his poem_.]\r\nVouchsafe my labour, and long live your lordship.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nI thank you, you shall hear from me anon.\r\nGo not away.—What have you there, my friend?\r\n\r\nPAINTER.\r\nA piece of painting, which I do beseech\r\nYour lordship to accept.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nPainting is welcome.\r\nThe painting is almost the natural man,\r\nFor since dishonour traffics with man’s nature,\r\nHe is but outside; these pencilled figures are\r\nEven such as they give out. I like your work,\r\nAnd you shall find I like it. Wait attendance\r\nTill you hear further from me.\r\n\r\nPAINTER.\r\nThe gods preserve you.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nWell fare you, gentleman. Give me your hand.\r\nWe must needs dine together. Sir, your jewel\r\nHath suffered under praise.\r\n\r\nJEWELLER.\r\nWhat, my lord, dispraise?\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nA mere satiety of commendations.\r\nIf I should pay you for ’t as ’tis extolled,\r\nIt would unclew me quite.\r\n\r\nJEWELLER.\r\nMy lord, ’tis rated\r\nAs those which sell would give. But you well know\r\nThings of like value, differing in the owners,\r\nAre prized by their masters. Believe’t, dear lord,\r\nYou mend the jewel by the wearing it.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nWell mocked.\r\n\r\nMERCHANT.\r\nNo, my good lord, he speaks the common tongue,\r\nWhich all men speak with him.\r\n\r\nEnter Apemantus.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nLook who comes here. Will you be chid?\r\n\r\nJEWELLER.\r\nWe’ll bear, with your lordship.\r\n\r\nMERCHANT.\r\nHe’ll spare none.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nGood morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nTill I be gentle, stay thou for thy good morrow—\r\nWhen thou art Timon’s dog, and these knaves honest.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nWhy dost thou call them knaves? Thou know’st them not.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nAre they not Athenians?\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nThen I repent not.\r\n\r\nJEWELLER.\r\nYou know me, Apemantus?\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nThou know’st I do, I called thee by thy name.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nThou art proud, Apemantus.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nOf nothing so much as that I am not like Timon.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nWhither art going?\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nTo knock out an honest Athenian’s brains.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nThat’s a deed thou’lt die for.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nRight, if doing nothing be death by th’ law.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nHow lik’st thou this picture, Apemantus?\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nThe best, for the innocence.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nWrought he not well that painted it?\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nHe wrought better that made the painter, and yet he’s but a filthy\r\npiece of work.\r\n\r\nPAINTER.\r\nYou’re a dog.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nThy mother’s of my generation. What’s she, if I be a dog?\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nWilt dine with me, Apemantus?\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nNo, I eat not lords.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nAn thou shouldst, thou’dst anger ladies.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nO, they eat lords. So they come by great bellies.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nThat’s a lascivious apprehension.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nSo thou apprehend’st it, take it for thy labour.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nHow dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus?\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nNot so well as plain-dealing, which will not cost a man a doit.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nWhat dost thou think ’tis worth?\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nNot worth my thinking. How now, poet?\r\n\r\nPOET.\r\nHow now, philosopher?\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nThou liest.\r\n\r\nPOET.\r\nArt not one?\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nPOET.\r\nThen I lie not.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nArt not a poet?\r\n\r\nPOET.\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nThen thou liest. Look in thy last work, where thou hast feigned him a\r\nworthy fellow.\r\n\r\nPOET.\r\nThat’s not feigned, he is so.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nYes, he is worthy of thee, and to pay thee for thy labour. He that\r\nloves to be flattered is worthy o’ th’ flatterer. Heavens, that I were\r\na lord!\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nWhat wouldst do then, Apemantus?\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nE’en as Apemantus does now, hate a lord with my heart.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nWhat, thyself?\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nAy.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nWherefore?\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nThat I had no angry wit to be a lord. Art not thou a merchant?\r\n\r\nMERCHANT.\r\nAy, Apemantus.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nTraffic confound thee, if the gods will not.\r\n\r\nMERCHANT.\r\nIf traffic do it, the gods do it.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nTraffic’s thy god, and thy god confound thee!\r\n\r\nTrumpet sounds. Enter a Messenger.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nWhat trumpet’s that?\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\n’Tis Alcibiades, and some twenty horse,\r\nAll of companionship.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nPray entertain them, give them guide to us.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt some Attendants._]\r\n\r\nYou must needs dine with me. Go not you hence\r\nTill I have thanked you; when dinner’s done,\r\nShow me this piece. I am joyful of your sights.\r\n\r\nEnter Alcibiades with his company.\r\n\r\nMost welcome, sir.\r\n\r\n[_They bow to each other._]\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\n[_Aside_.] So, so, there!\r\nAches contract and starve your supple joints!\r\nThat there should be small love amongst these sweet knaves,\r\nAnd all this courtesy! The strain of man’s bred out\r\nInto baboon and monkey.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nSir, you have saved my longing, and I feed\r\nMost hungerly on your sight.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nRight welcome, sir!\r\nEre we depart we’ll share a bounteous time\r\nIn different pleasures. Pray you, let us in.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt all but Apemantus._]\r\n\r\nEnter two Lords.\r\n\r\nFIRST LORD.\r\nWhat time o’ day is’t, Apemantus?\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nTime to be honest.\r\n\r\nFIRST LORD.\r\nThat time serves still.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nThe more accursed thou, that still omitt’st it.\r\n\r\nSECOND LORD.\r\nThou art going to Lord Timon’s feast?\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nAy, to see meat fill knaves and wine heat fools.\r\n\r\nSECOND LORD.\r\nFare thee well, fare thee well.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nThou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.\r\n\r\nSECOND LORD.\r\nWhy, Apemantus?\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nShouldst have kept one to thyself, for I mean to give thee none.\r\n\r\nFIRST LORD.\r\nHang thyself!\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nNo, I will do nothing at thy bidding. Make thy requests to thy friend.\r\n\r\nSECOND LORD.\r\nAway, unpeaceable dog, or I’ll spurn thee hence.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nI will fly, like a dog, the heels o’ th’ ass.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nFIRST LORD.\r\nHe’s opposite to humanity. Come, shall we in\r\nAnd taste Lord Timon’s bounty? He outgoes\r\nThe very heart of kindness.\r\n\r\nSECOND LORD.\r\nHe pours it out; Plutus, the god of gold,\r\nIs but his steward. No meed but he repays\r\nSevenfold above itself, no gift to him\r\nBut breeds the giver a return exceeding\r\nAll use of quittance.\r\n\r\nFIRST LORD.\r\nThe noblest mind he carries\r\nThat ever governed man.\r\n\r\nSECOND LORD.\r\nLong may he live in fortunes. Shall we in?\r\n\r\nFIRST LORD.\r\nI’ll keep you company.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. The Same. A room of state in Timon’s house\r\n\r\nHautboys playing loud music. A great banquet served in, Flavius and\r\nothers attending; and then enter Lord Timon, the Senators, the\r\nAthenian Lords, Alcibiades, and Ventidius, which Timon redeemded from\r\nprison. Then comes, dropping after all, Apemantus, discontentedly, like\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nVENTIDIUS.\r\nMost honoured Timon,\r\nIt hath pleased the gods to remember my father’s age\r\nAnd call him to long peace.\r\nHe is gone happy and has left me rich.\r\nThen, as in grateful virtue I am bound\r\nTo your free heart, I do return those talents,\r\nDoubled with thanks and service, from whose help\r\nI derived liberty.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nO, by no means,\r\nHonest Ventidius. You mistake my love.\r\nI gave it freely ever, and there’s none\r\nCan truly say he gives if he receives.\r\nIf our betters play at that game, we must not dare\r\nTo imitate them; faults that are rich are fair.\r\n\r\nVENTIDIUS.\r\nA noble spirit!\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nNay, my lords, ceremony was but devised at first\r\nTo set a gloss on faint deeds, hollow welcomes,\r\nRecanting goodness, sorry ere ’tis shown;\r\nBut where there is true friendship there needs none.\r\nPray, sit, more welcome are ye to my fortunes\r\nThan my fortunes to me.\r\n\r\n[_They sit._]\r\n\r\nFIRST LORD.\r\nMy lord, we always have confessed it.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nHo, ho, confessed it? Hanged it, have you not?\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nO Apemantus, you are welcome.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nNo,\r\nYou shall not make me welcome.\r\nI come to have thee thrust me out of doors.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nFie, thou’rt a churl, ye’ve got a humour there\r\nDoes not become a man; ’tis much to blame.\r\nThey say, my lords, _ira furor brevis est_,\r\nBut yond man is ever angry.\r\nGo, let him have a table by himself,\r\nFor he does neither affect company,\r\nNor is he fit for it indeed.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nLet me stay at thine apperil, Timon.\r\nI come to observe; I give thee warning on’t.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nI take no heed of thee. Thou’rt an Athenian, therefore, welcome. I\r\nmyself would have no power; prithee; let my meat make thee silent.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nI scorn thy meat, ’twould choke me, for I should ne’er flatter thee. O\r\nyou gods, what a number of men eats Timon, and he sees ’em not! It\r\ngrieves me to see so many dip their meat in one man’s blood; and all\r\nthe madness is, he cheers them up too.\r\nI wonder men dare trust themselves with men.\r\nMethinks they should invite them without knives.\r\nGood for their meat, and safer for their lives.\r\nThere’s much example for ’t. The fellow that sits next him, now parts\r\nbread with him, pledges the breath of him in a divided draft, is the\r\nreadiest man to kill him. ’T has been proved. If I were a huge man, I\r\nshould fear to drink at meals,\r\nLest they should spy my wind-pipe’s dangerous notes.\r\nGreat men should drink with harness on their throats.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nMy lord, in heart, and let the health go round.\r\n\r\nSECOND LORD.\r\nLet it flow this way, my good lord.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nFlow this way? A brave fellow! He keeps his tides well. Those healths\r\nwill make thee and thy state look ill, Timon.\r\nHere’s that which is too weak to be a sinner,\r\nHonest water, which ne’er left man i’ the mire.\r\nThis and my food are equals, there’s no odds.\r\nFeasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.\r\n\r\n_Apemantus’ grace_\r\n\n Immortal gods, I crave no pelf,\r\n I pray for no man but myself.\r\n Grant I may never prove so fond\r\n To trust man on his oath or bond,\r\n Or a harlot for her weeping,\r\n Or a dog that seems a-sleeping,\r\n Or a keeper with my freedom,\r\n Or my friends if I should need ’em.\r\n Amen. So fall to’t.\r\n Rich men sin, and I eat root.\r\n\r\n[_He eats and drinks._]\r\n\r\nMuch good dich thy good heart, Apemantus!\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nCaptain Alcibiades, your heart’s in the field now.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nMy heart is ever at your service, my lord.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nYou had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than a dinner of friends.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nSo they were bleeding new, my lord, there’s no meat like ’em. I could\r\nwish my best friend at such a feast.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nWould all those flatterers were thine enemies then, that then thou\r\nmightst kill ’em, and bid me to ’em.\r\n\r\nFIRST LORD.\r\nMight we but have that happiness, my lord, that you would once use our\r\nhearts, whereby we might express some part of our zeals, we should\r\nthink ourselves for ever perfect.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nO, no doubt, my good friends, but the gods themselves have provided\r\nthat I shall have much help from you. How had you been my friends else?\r\nWhy have you that charitable title from thousands, did not you chiefly\r\nbelong to my heart? I have told more of you to myself than you can with\r\nmodesty speak in your own behalf. And thus far I confirm you. O you\r\ngods, think I, what need we have any friends if we should ne’er have\r\nneed of ’em? They were the most needless creatures living, should we\r\nne’er have use for ’em, and would most resemble sweet instruments hung\r\nup in cases, that keep their sounds to themselves. Why, I have often\r\nwished myself poorer that I might come nearer to you. We are born to do\r\nbenefits, and what better or properer can we call our own than the\r\nriches of our friends? O, what a precious comfort ’tis to have so many,\r\nlike brothers, commanding one another’s fortunes. O joy’s e’en made\r\naway ere’t can be born! Mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks. To\r\nforget their faults, I drink to you.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nThou weep’st to make them drink, Timon.\r\n\r\nSECOND LORD.\r\nJoy had the like conception in our eyes\r\nAnd, at that instant like a babe sprung up.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nHo, ho! I laugh to think that babe a bastard.\r\n\r\nTHIRD LORD.\r\nI promise you, my lord, you moved me much.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nMuch!\r\n\r\n[_A tucket sounds._]\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nWhat means that trump?\r\n\r\nEnter a Servant.\r\n\r\nHow now?\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nPlease you, my lord, there are certain ladies most desirous of\r\nadmittance.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nLadies? What are their wills?\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nThere comes with them a forerunner, my lord, which bears that office,\r\nto signify their pleasures.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nI pray, let them be admitted.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Servant._]\r\n\r\nEnter Cupid.\r\n\r\nCUPID.\r\nHail to thee, worthy Timon, and to all\r\nThat of his bounties taste! The five best senses\r\nAcknowledge thee their patron and come freely\r\nTo gratulate thy plenteous bosom.

Enter a masque of Ladies as Amazons, with lutes in their hands,\r\ndancing and playing.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nHoy-day!\r\nWhat a sweep of vanity comes this way.\r\nThey dance? They are madwomen.\r\nLike madness is the glory of this life,\r\nAs this pomp shows to a little oil and root.\r\nWe make ourselves fools to disport ourselves,\r\nAnd spend our flatteries to drink those men\r\nUpon whose age we void it up again\r\nWith poisonous spite and envy.\r\nWho lives that’s not depraved or depraves?\r\nWho dies that bears not one spurn to their graves\r\nOf their friend’s gift?\r\nI should fear those that dance before me now\r\nWould one day stamp upon me. ’T has been done.\r\nMen shut their doors against a setting sun.\r\n\r\n[_The Lords rise from table, with much adoring of Timon, and to show\r\ntheir loves each singles out an Amazon, and all dance, men with women,\r\na lofty strain or two to the hautboys, and cease._]\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nYou have done our pleasures much grace, fair ladies,\r\nSet a fair fashion on our entertainment,\r\nWhich was not half so beautiful and kind.\r\nYou have added worth unto ’t and lustre,\r\nAnd entertained me with mine own device.\r\nI am to thank you for ’t.\r\n\r\nFIRST LADY.\r\nMy lord, you take us even at the best.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nFaith, for the worst is filthy and would not hold taking, I doubt me.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nLadies, there is an idle banquet attends you,\r\nPlease you to dispose yourselves.\r\n\r\nALL LADIES.\r\nMost thankfully, my lord.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Cupid and Ladies._]\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nFlavius!\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS.\r\nMy lord?\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nThe little casket bring me hither.\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS.\r\nYes, my lord.

I did endure\r\nNot seldom nor no slight checks, when I have\r\nPrompted you in the ebb of your estate\r\nAnd your great flow of debts. My loved lord,\r\nThough you hear now, too late, yet now’s a time.\r\nThe greatest of your having lacks a half\r\nTo pay your present debts.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nLet all my land be sold.\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS.\r\n’Tis all engaged, some forfeited and gone,\r\nAnd what remains will hardly stop the mouth\r\nOf present dues; the future comes apace.\r\nWhat shall defend the interim? And at length\r\nHow goes our reckoning?\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nTo Lacedaemon did my land extend.\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS.\r\nO my good lord, the world is but a word;\r\nWere it all yours to give it in a breath,\r\nHow quickly were it gone!\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nYou tell me true.\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS.\r\nIf you suspect my husbandry or falsehood,\r\nCall me before th’ exactest auditors\r\nAnd set me on the proof. So the gods bless me,\r\nWhen all our offices have been oppressed\r\nWith riotous feeders, when our vaults have wept\r\nWith drunken spilth of wine, when every room\r\nHath blazed with lights and brayed with minstrelsy,\r\nI have retired me to a wasteful cock\r\nAnd set mine eyes at flow.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nPrithee, no more.\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS.\r\nHeavens, have I said, the bounty of this lord!\r\nHow many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants\r\nThis night englutted? Who is not Timon’s?\r\nWhat heart, head, sword, force, means, but is Lord Timon’s?\r\nGreat Timon, noble, worthy, royal Timon!\r\nAh, when the means are gone that buy this praise,\r\nThe breath is gone whereof this praise is made.\r\nFeast-won, fast-lost; one cloud of winter showers,\r\nThese flies are couched.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nCome, sermon me no further.\r\nNo villainous bounty yet hath passed my heart;\r\nUnwisely, not ignobly, have I given.\r\nWhy dost thou weep? Canst thou the conscience lack\r\nTo think I shall lack friends? Secure thy heart.\r\nIf I would broach the vessels of my love\r\nAnd try the argument of hearts by borrowing,\r\nMen and men’s fortunes could I frankly use\r\nAs I can bid thee speak.\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS.\r\nAssurance bless your thoughts!\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nAnd in some sort these wants of mine are crowned,\r\nThat I account them blessings. For by these\r\nShall I try friends. You shall perceive how you\r\nMistake my fortunes. I am wealthy in my friends.\r\nWithin there! Flaminius!

Commend me to their loves;\r\nand I am proud, say, that my occasions have found time to use ’em\r\ntoward a supply of money. Let the request be fifty talents.\r\n\r\nFLAMINIUS.\r\nAs you have said, my lord.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Servants._]\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS.\r\n[_Aside_.] Lord Lucius and Lucullus?

Can’t be?\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS.\r\nThey answer in a joint and corporate voice\r\nThat now they are at fall, want treasure, cannot\r\nDo what they would, are sorry. You are honourable,\r\nBut yet they could have wished—they know not—\r\nSomething hath been amiss—a noble nature\r\nMay catch a wrench—would all were well—’tis pity.\r\nAnd so, intending other serious matters,\r\nAfter distasteful looks and these hard fractions,\r\nWith certain half-caps and cold-moving nods\r\nThey froze me into silence.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nYou gods, reward them!\r\nPrithee, man, look cheerly. These old fellows\r\nHave their ingratitude in them hereditary.\r\nTheir blood is caked, ’tis cold, it seldom flows;\r\n’Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind;\r\nAnd nature, as it grows again toward earth,\r\nIs fashioned for the journey, dull and heavy.\r\nGo to Ventidius. Prithee, be not sad,\r\nThou art true and honest, ingenuously I speak,\r\nNo blame belongs to thee. Ventidius lately\r\nBuried his father, by whose death he’s stepped\r\nInto a great estate. When he was poor,\r\nImprisoned and in scarcity of friends,\r\nI cleared him with five talents. Greet him from me,\r\nBid him suppose some good necessity\r\nTouches his friend, which craves to be remembered\r\nWith those five talents. That had, give’t these fellows\r\nTo whom ’tis instant due. Ne’er speak, or think\r\nThat Timon’s fortunes ’mong his friends can sink.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS.\r\nI would I could not think it.\r\nThat thought is bounty’s foe;\r\nBeing free itself, it thinks all others so.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\nACT III\r\n\r\nSCENE I.

Fill me some wine.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Servant._]\r\n\r\nAnd how does that honourable, complete, free-hearted gentleman of\r\nAthens, thy very bountiful good lord and master?\r\n\r\nFLAMINIUS.\r\nHis health is well, sir.\r\n\r\nLUCULLUS.\r\nI am right glad that his health is well, sir. And what hast thou there\r\nunder thy cloak, pretty Flaminius?\r\n\r\nFLAMINIUS.\r\nFaith, nothing but an empty box, sir, which in my lord’s behalf I come\r\nto entreat your honour to supply; who, having great and instant\r\noccasion to use fifty talents, hath sent to your lordship to furnish\r\nhim, nothing doubting your present assistance therein.\r\n\r\nLUCULLUS.\r\nLa, la, la, la! Nothing doubting, says he? Alas, good lord! A noble\r\ngentleman ’tis, if he would not keep so good a house. Many a time and\r\noften I ha’ dined with him, and told him on’t, and come again to supper\r\nto him of purpose to have him spend less, and yet he would embrace no\r\ncounsel, take no warning by my coming. Every man has his fault, and\r\nhonesty is his. I ha’ told him on’t, but I could ne’er get him from ’t.\r\n\r\nEnter Servant with wine.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nPlease your lordship, here is the wine.\r\n\r\nLUCULLUS.\r\nFlaminius, I have noted thee always wise. Here’s to thee.\r\n\r\nFLAMINIUS.\r\nYour lordship speaks your pleasure.\r\n\r\nLUCULLUS.\r\nI have observed thee always for a towardly prompt spirit, give thee thy\r\ndue, and one that knows what belongs to reason, and canst use the time\r\nwell, if the time use thee well. Good parts in thee. [_To Servant_.]\r\nGet you gone, sirrah.—\r\n\r\n[_Exit Servant._]\r\n\r\nDraw nearer, honest Flaminius. Thy lord’s a bountiful gentleman, but\r\nthou art wise and thou know’st well enough, although thou com’st to me,\r\nthat this is no time to lend money, especially upon bare friendship\r\nwithout security. Here’s three solidares for thee. Good boy, wink at\r\nme, and say thou saw’st me not. Fare thee well.\r\n\r\nFLAMINIUS.\r\nIs’t possible the world should so much differ,\r\nAnd we alive that lived? Fly, damned baseness,\r\nTo him that worships thee.\r\n\r\n[_Throws the money back._]\r\n\r\nLUCULLUS.\r\nHa! Now I see thou art a fool and fit for thy master.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nFLAMINIUS.\r\nMay these add to the number that may scald thee!\r\nLet molten coin be thy damnation,\r\nThou disease of a friend, and not himself!\r\nHas friendship such a faint and milky heart\r\nIt turns in less than two nights? O you gods,\r\nI feel my master’s passion. This slave\r\nUnto his honour has my lord’s meat in him.\r\nWhy should it thrive and turn to nutriment\r\nWhen he is turned to poison?\r\nO, may diseases only work upon’t,\r\nAnd when he’s sick to death, let not that part of nature\r\nWhich my lord paid for be of any power\r\nTo expel sickness, but prolong his hour.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. A public place\r\n\r\nEnter Lucius with three Strangers.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nWho, the Lord Timon? He is my very good friend and an honourable\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\nFIRST STRANGER.\r\nWe know him for no less, though we are but strangers to him. But I can\r\ntell you one thing, my lord, and which I hear from common rumours: now\r\nLord Timon’s happy hours are done and past, and his estate shrinks from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nFie, no, do not believe it; he cannot want for money.\r\n\r\nSECOND STRANGER.\r\nBut believe you this, my lord, that, not long ago one of his men was\r\nwith the Lord Lucullus to borrow so many talents, nay, urged extremely\r\nfor’t, and showed what necessity belonged to’t, and yet was denied.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nHow?\r\n\r\nSECOND STRANGER.\r\nI tell you, denied, my lord.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nWhat a strange case was that! Now, before the gods, I am ashamed on’t.\r\nDenied that honourable man? There was very little honour showed in’t.\r\nFor my own part, I must needs confess, I have received some small\r\nkindnesses from him, as money, plate, jewels, and such like trifles,\r\nnothing comparing to his; yet had he mistook him, and sent to me, I\r\nshould ne’er have denied his occasion so many talents.\r\n\r\nEnter Servilius.\r\n\r\nSERVILIUS.\r\nSee, by good hap, yonder’s my lord; I have sweat to see his honour.\r\n[_To Lucius_.] My honoured lord!\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nServilius? You are kindly met, sir. Fare thee well. Commend me to thy\r\nhonourable virtuous lord, my very exquisite friend.\r\n\r\nSERVILIUS.\r\nMay it please your honour, my lord hath sent—\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nHa! What has he sent? I am so much endeared to that lord; he’s ever\r\nsending. How shall I thank him, thinkest thou? And what has he sent\r\nnow?\r\n\r\nSERVILIUS.\r\nHas only sent his present occasion now, my lord, requesting your\r\nlordship to supply his instant use with so many talents.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nI know his lordship is but merry with me;\r\nHe cannot want fifty-five hundred talents.\r\n\r\nSERVILIUS.\r\nBut in the meantime he wants less, my lord.\r\nIf his occasion were not virtuous,\r\nI should not urge it half so faithfully.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nDost thou speak seriously, Servilius?\r\n\r\nSERVILIUS.\r\nUpon my soul, ’tis true, sir.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nWhat a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself against such a good\r\ntime, when I might ha’ shown myself honourable! How unluckily it\r\nhappened that I should purchase the day before for a little part, and\r\nundo a great deal of honour! Servilius, now before the gods, I am not\r\nable to do—the more beast, I say—I was sending to use Lord Timon\r\nmyself, these gentlemen can witness; but I would not for the wealth of\r\nAthens I had done it now. Commend me bountifully to his good lordship,\r\nand I hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me, because I have\r\nno power to be kind. And tell him this from me: I count it one of my\r\ngreatest afflictions, say, that I cannot pleasure such an honourable\r\ngentleman. Good Servilius, will you befriend me so far as to use mine\r\nown words to him?\r\n\r\nSERVILIUS.\r\nYes, sir, I shall.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nI’ll look you out a good turn, Servilius.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Servilius._]\r\n\r\nTrue, as you said, Timon is shrunk indeed,\r\nAnd he that’s once denied will hardly speed.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nFIRST STRANGER.\r\nDo you observe this, Hostilius?\r\n\r\nSECOND STRANGER.\r\nAy, too well.\r\n\r\nFIRST STRANGER.\r\nWhy, this is the world’s soul, and just of the same piece\r\nIs every flatterer’s spirit. Who can call him his friend\r\nThat dips in the same dish? For, in my knowing,\r\nTimon has been this lord’s father\r\nAnd kept his credit with his purse,\r\nSupported his estate, nay, Timon’s money\r\nHas paid his men their wages. He ne’er drinks\r\nBut Timon’s silver treads upon his lip,\r\nAnd yet—O, see the monstrousness of man\r\nWhen he looks out in an ungrateful shape—\r\nHe does deny him, in respect of his,\r\nWhat charitable men afford to beggars.\r\n\r\nTHIRD STRANGER.\r\nReligion groans at it.\r\n\r\nFIRST STRANGER.\r\nFor mine own part,\r\nI never tasted Timon in my life,\r\nNor came any of his bounties over me\r\nTo mark me for his friend. Yet I protest,\r\nFor his right noble mind, illustrious virtue,\r\nAnd honourable carriage,\r\nHad his necessity made use of me,\r\nI would have put my wealth into donation,\r\nAnd the best half should have returned to him,\r\nSo much I love his heart. But I perceive\r\nMen must learn now with pity to dispense,\r\nFor policy sits above conscience.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. The same. A room in Sempronius’ house\r\n\r\nEnter a Third Servant of Timon’s with Sempronius, another of Timon’s\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nSEMPRONIUS.\r\nMust he needs trouble me in’t? Hum! ’Bove all others?\r\nHe might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus;\r\nAnd now Ventidius is wealthy too,\r\nWhom he redeemed from prison. All these\r\nOwe their estates unto him.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nMy lord,\r\nThey have all been touched and found base metal,\r\nFor they have all denied him.\r\n\r\nSEMPRONIUS.\r\nHow? Have they denied him?\r\nHas Ventidius and Lucullus denied him\r\nAnd does he send to me? Three? Humh!\r\nIt shows but little love or judgment in him.\r\nMust I be his last refuge? His friends, like physicians,\r\nThrive, give him over. Must I take th’ cure upon me?\r\nHas much disgraced me in’t. I’m angry at him,\r\nThat might have known my place. I see no sense for’t\r\nBut his occasions might have wooed me first;\r\nFor, in my conscience, I was the first man\r\nThat e’er received gift from him.\r\nAnd does he think so backwardly of me now\r\nThat I’ll requite it last? No.\r\nSo it may prove an argument of laughter\r\nTo th’ rest, and I ’mongst lords be thought a fool.\r\nI’d rather than the worth of thrice the sum\r\nHad sent to me first, but for my mind’s sake;\r\nI’d such a courage to do him good. But now return,\r\nAnd with their faint reply this answer join:\r\nWho bates mine honour shall not know my coin.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nExcellent! Your lordship’s a goodly villain. The devil knew not what he\r\ndid when he made man politic; he crossed himself by’t, and I cannot\r\nthink but, in the end the villainies of man will set him clear. How\r\nfairly this lord strives to appear foul! Takes virtuous copies to be\r\nwicked, like those that under hot ardent zeal would set whole realms on\r\nfire.\r\nOf such a nature is his politic love.\r\nThis was my lord’s best hope, now all are fled\r\nSave only the gods. Now his friends are dead,\r\nDoors that were ne’er acquainted with their wards\r\nMany a bounteous year must be employed\r\nNow to guard sure their master.\r\nAnd this is all a liberal course allows,\r\nWho cannot keep his wealth must keep his house.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV. A hall in Timon’s house\r\n\r\nEnter two of Varro’s Servants meeting Titus and Hortensius and then\r\nLucius, all Servants of Timon’s creditors, to wait for his coming out.\r\n\r\nFIRST VARRO’S SERVANT.\r\nWell met, good morrow, Titus and Hortensius.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nThe like to you, kind Varro.\r\n\r\nHORTENSIUS.\r\nLucius!\r\nWhat, do we meet together?\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nAy, and I think\r\nOne business does command us all;\r\nFor mine is money.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nSo is theirs and ours.\r\n\r\nEnter Philotus.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nAnd, sir, Philotus too!\r\n\r\nPHILOTUS.\r\nGood day at once.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nWelcome, good brother.\r\nWhat do you think the hour?\r\n\r\nPHILOTUS.\r\nLabouring for nine.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nSo much?\r\n\r\nPHILOTUS.\r\nIs not my lord seen yet?\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nNot yet.\r\n\r\nPHILOTUS.\r\nI wonder on’t, he was wont to shine at seven.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nAy, but the days are waxed shorter with him.\r\nYou must consider that a prodigal course\r\nIs like the sun’s, but not like his recoverable.\r\nI fear ’tis deepest winter in Lord Timon’s purse:\r\nThat is, one may reach deep enough, and yet\r\nFind little.\r\n\r\nPHILOTUS.\r\nI am of your fear for that.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nI’ll show you how t’ observe a strange event.\r\nYour lord sends now for money?\r\n\r\nHORTENSIUS.\r\nMost true, he does.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nAnd he wears jewels now of Timon’s gift,\r\nFor which I wait for money.\r\n\r\nHORTENSIUS.\r\nIt is against my heart.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nMark how strange it shows,\r\nTimon in this should pay more than he owes,\r\nAnd e’en as if your lord should wear rich jewels\r\nAnd send for money for ’em.\r\n\r\nHORTENSIUS.\r\nI’m weary of this charge, the gods can witness.\r\nI know my lord hath spent of Timon’s wealth,\r\nAnd now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth.\r\n\r\nFIRST VARRO’S SERVANT.\r\nYes, mine’s three thousand crowns. What’s yours?\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nFive thousand mine.\r\n\r\nFIRST VARRO’S SERVANT.\r\n’Tis much deep, and it should seem by th’ sum\r\nYour master’s confidence was above mine,\r\nElse surely his had equalled.\r\n\r\nEnter Flaminius.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nOne of Lord Timon’s men.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nFlaminius? Sir, a word. Pray, is my lord ready to come forth?\r\n\r\nFLAMINIUS.\r\nNo, indeed he is not.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nWe attend his lordship; pray, signify so much.\r\n\r\nFLAMINIUS.\r\nI need not tell him that, he knows you are too diligent.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Flaminius._]\r\n\r\nEnter Flavius in a cloak, muffled.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nHa, is not that his steward muffled so?\r\nHe goes away in a cloud. Call him, call him.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nDo you hear, sir?\r\n\r\nSECOND VARRO’S SERVANT.\r\nBy your leave, sir.\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS.\r\nWhat do you ask of me, my friend?\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nWe wait for certain money here, sir.\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS.\r\nAy,\r\nIf money were as certain as your waiting,\r\n’Twere sure enough.\r\nWhy then preferred you not your sums and bills\r\nWhen your false masters eat of my lord’s meat?\r\nThen they could smile and fawn upon his debts,\r\nAnd take down th’ interest into their gluttonous maws.\r\nYou do yourselves but wrong to stir me up,\r\nLet me pass quietly.\r\nBelieve’t, my lord and I have made an end,\r\nI have no more to reckon, he to spend.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nAy, but this answer will not serve.\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS.\r\nIf ’twill not serve, ’tis not so base as you,\r\nFor you serve knaves.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nFIRST VARRO’S SERVANT.\r\nHow? What does his cashiered worship mutter?\r\n\r\nSECOND VARRO’S SERVANT.\r\nNo matter what, he’s poor, and that’s revenge enough. Who can speak\r\nbroader than he that has no house to put his head in? Such may rail\r\nagainst great buildings.\r\n\r\nEnter Servilius.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nO, here’s Servilius; now we shall know some answer.\r\n\r\nSERVILIUS.\r\nIf I might beseech you, gentlemen, to repair some other hour, I should\r\nderive much from’t. For take’t of my soul, my lord leans wondrously to\r\ndiscontent. His comfortable temper has forsook him, he’s much out of\r\nhealth and keeps his chamber.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nMany do keep their chambers are not sick.\r\nAnd if it be so far beyond his health,\r\nMethinks he should the sooner pay his debts\r\nAnd make a clear way to the gods.\r\n\r\nSERVILIUS.\r\nGood gods!\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nWe cannot take this for answer, sir.\r\n\r\nFLAMINIUS.\r\n[_Within_.] Servilius, help! My lord, my lord!\r\n\r\nEnter Timon in a rage.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nWhat, are my doors opposed against my passage?\r\nHave I been ever free, and must my house\r\nBe my retentive enemy, my jail?\r\nThe place which I have feasted, does it now,\r\nLike all mankind, show me an iron heart?\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nPut in now, Titus.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nMy lord, here is my bill.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nHere’s mine.\r\n\r\nHORTENSIUS.\r\nAnd mine, my lord.\r\n\r\nBOTH VARRO’S SERVANTS.\r\nAnd ours, my lord.\r\n\r\nPHILOTUS.\r\nAll our bills.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nKnock me down with ’em! Cleave me to the girdle.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nAlas, my lord—\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nCut my heart in sums!\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nMine, fifty talents.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nTell out my blood.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nFive thousand crowns, my lord.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nFive thousand drops pays that. What yours, and yours?\r\n\r\nFIRST VARRO’S SERVANT.\r\nMy lord—\r\n\r\nSECOND VARRO’S SERVANT.\r\nMy lord—\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nTear me, take me, and the gods fall upon you!\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nHORTENSIUS.\r\nFaith, I perceive our masters may throw their caps at their money.\r\nThese debts may well be called desperate ones, for a madman owes ’em.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nEnter Timon and Flavius.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nThey have e’en put my breath from me, the slaves.\r\nCreditors? Devils!\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS.\r\nMy dear lord—\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nWhat if it should be so?\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS.\r\nMy lord—\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nI’ll have it so.—My steward!\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS.\r\nHere, my lord.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nSo fitly? Go, bid all my friends again,\r\nLucius, Lucullus, and Sempronius, all.\r\nI’ll once more feast the rascals.\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS.\r\nO my lord,\r\nYou only speak from your distracted soul;\r\nThere is not so much left to furnish out\r\nA moderate table.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nBe it not in thy care. Go,\r\nI charge thee, invite them all. Let in the tide\r\nOf knaves once more. My cook and I’ll provide.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE V. The same. The senate house\r\n\r\nEnter three Senators at one door, Alcibiades meeting them, with\r\nAttendants.\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nMy lord, you have my voice to ’t. The fault’s\r\nBloody. ’Tis necessary he should die.\r\nNothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.\r\n\r\nSECOND SENATOR.\r\nMost true, the law shall bruise ’em.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nHonour, health, and compassion to the senate!\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nNow, captain?\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nI am a humble suitor to your virtues,\r\nFor pity is the virtue of the law,\r\nAnd none but tyrants use it cruelly.\r\nIt pleases time and fortune to lie heavy\r\nUpon a friend of mine, who in hot blood\r\nHath stepped into the law, which is past depth\r\nTo those that without heed do plunge into’t.\r\nHe is a man, setting his fate aside,\r\nOf comely virtues,\r\nNor did he soil the fact with cowardice—\r\nAn honour in him which buys out his fault—\r\nBut with a noble fury and fair spirit,\r\nSeeing his reputation touched to death,\r\nHe did oppose his foe;\r\nAnd with such sober and unnoted passion\r\nHe did behave his anger, ere ’twas spent,\r\nAs if he had but proved an argument.\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nYou undergo too strict a paradox,\r\nStriving to make an ugly deed look fair.\r\nYour words have took such pains as if they laboured\r\nTo bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling\r\nUpon the head of valour, which indeed\r\nIs valour misbegot and came into the world\r\nWhen sects and factions were newly born.\r\nHe’s truly valiant that can wisely suffer\r\nThe worst that man can breathe, and make his wrongs\r\nHis outsides to wear them like his raiment, carelessly,\r\nAnd ne’er prefer his injuries to his heart,\r\nTo bring it into danger.\r\nIf wrongs be evils and enforce us kill,\r\nWhat folly ’tis to hazard life for ill!\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nMy lord—\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nYou cannot make gross sins look clear.\r\nTo revenge is no valour, but to bear.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nMy lords, then, under favour, pardon me\r\nIf I speak like a captain.\r\nWhy do fond men expose themselves to battle\r\nAnd not endure all threats? Sleep upon’t,\r\nAnd let the foes quietly cut their throats\r\nWithout repugnancy? If there be\r\nSuch valour in the bearing, what make we\r\nAbroad? Why, then, women are more valiant\r\nThat stay at home, if bearing carry it,\r\nAnd the ass more captain than the lion, the felon\r\nLoaden with irons wiser than the judge,\r\nIf wisdom be in suffering. O my lords,\r\nAs you are great, be pitifully good.\r\nWho cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?\r\nTo kill, I grant, is sin’s extremest gust,\r\nBut in defence, by mercy, ’tis most just.\r\nTo be in anger is impiety,\r\nBut who is man that is not angry?\r\nWeigh but the crime with this.\r\n\r\nSECOND SENATOR.\r\nYou breathe in vain.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nIn vain? His service done\r\nAt Lacedaemon and Byzantium\r\nWere a sufficient briber for his life.\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nWhat’s that?\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nWhy, I say, my lords, has done fair service\r\nAnd slain in fight many of your enemies.\r\nHow full of valour did he bear himself\r\nIn the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds!\r\n\r\nSECOND SENATOR.\r\nHe has made too much plenty with ’em.\r\nHe’s a sworn rioter. He has a sin\r\nThat often drowns him and takes his valour prisoner.\r\nIf there were no foes, that were enough\r\nTo overcome him. In that beastly fury,\r\nHe has been known to commit outrages\r\nAnd cherish factions. ’Tis inferred to us\r\nHis days are foul and his drink dangerous.\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nHe dies.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nHard fate! He might have died in war.\r\nMy lords, if not for any parts in him,\r\nThough his right arm might purchase his own time\r\nAnd be in debt to none, yet, more to move you,\r\nTake my deserts to his and join ’em both.\r\nAnd, for I know your reverend ages love\r\nSecurity, I’ll pawn my victories, all\r\nMy honour, to you upon his good returns.\r\nIf by this crime he owes the law his life,\r\nWhy, let the war receive’t in valiant gore,\r\nFor law is strict, and war is nothing more.\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nWe are for law. He dies. Urge it no more,\r\nOn height of our displeasure. Friend or brother,\r\nHe forfeits his own blood that spills another.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nMust it be so? It must not be.\r\nMy lords, I do beseech you, know me.\r\n\r\nSECOND SENATOR.\r\nHow?\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nCall me to your remembrances.\r\n\r\nTHIRD SENATOR.\r\nWhat?\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nI cannot think but your age has forgot me,\r\nIt could not else be I should prove so base\r\nTo sue and be denied such common grace.\r\nMy wounds ache at you.\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nDo you dare our anger?\r\n’Tis in few words, but spacious in effect:\r\nWe banish thee for ever.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nBanish me?\r\nBanish your dotage, banish usury,\r\nThat makes the Senate ugly.\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nIf, after two days’ shine, Athens contain thee,\r\nAttend our weightier judgment.\r\nAnd, not to swell our spirit,\r\nHe shall be executed presently.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Senators._]\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nNow the gods keep you old enough, that you may live\r\nOnly in bone, that none may look on you!\r\nI’m worse than mad. I have kept back their foes\r\nWhile they have told their money and let out\r\nTheir coin upon large interest, I myself\r\nRich only in large hurts. All those for this?\r\nIs this the balsam that the usuring senate\r\nPours into captains’ wounds? Banishment.\r\nIt comes not ill. I hate not to be banished.\r\nIt is a cause worthy my spleen and fury,\r\nThat I may strike at Athens. I’ll cheer up\r\nMy discontented troops and lay for hearts.\r\n’Tis honour with most lands to be at odds.\r\nSoldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE VI. A room of state in Timon’s house\r\n\r\nMusic. Enter divers Friends at several doors.\r\n\r\nFIRST FRIEND.\r\nThe good time of day to you, sir.\r\n\r\nSECOND FRIEND.\r\nI also wish it to you. I think this honourable lord did but try us this\r\nother day.\r\n\r\nFIRST FRIEND.\r\nUpon that were my thoughts tiring when we encountered. I hope it is not\r\nso low with him as he made it seem in the trial of his several friends.\r\n\r\nSECOND FRIEND.\r\nIt should not be, by the persuasion of his new feasting.\r\n\r\nFIRST FRIEND.\r\nI should think so. He hath sent me an earnest inviting, which many my\r\nnear occasions did urge me to put off; but he hath conjured me beyond\r\nthem, and I must needs appear.\r\n\r\nSECOND FRIEND.\r\nIn like manner was I in debt to my importunate business, but he would\r\nnot hear my excuse. I am sorry, when he sent to borrow of me, that my\r\nprovision was out.\r\n\r\nFIRST FRIEND.\r\nI am sick of that grief too, as I understand how all things go.\r\n\r\nSECOND FRIEND.\r\nEvery man here’s so. What would he have borrowed you?\r\n\r\nFIRST FRIEND.\r\nA thousand pieces.\r\n\r\nSECOND FRIEND.\r\nA thousand pieces!\r\n\r\nFIRST FRIEND.\r\nWhat of you?\r\n\r\nSECOND FRIEND.\r\nHe sent to me, sir—here he comes.\r\n\r\nEnter Timon and Attendants.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nWith all my heart, gentlemen both! And how fare you?\r\n\r\nFIRST FRIEND.\r\nEver at the best, hearing well of your lordship.\r\n\r\nSECOND FRIEND.\r\nThe swallow follows not summer more willing than we your lordship.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\n[_Aside_.] Nor more willingly leaves winter, such summer birds are men.\r\nGentlemen, our dinner will not recompense this long stay. Feast your\r\nears with the music awhile, if they will fare so harshly o’ th’\r\ntrumpet’s sound; we shall to’t presently.\r\n\r\nFIRST FRIEND.\r\nI hope it remains not unkindly with your lordship that I returned you\r\nan empty messenger.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nO, sir, let it not trouble you.\r\n\r\nSECOND FRIEND.\r\nMy noble lord—\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nAh, my good friend, what cheer?\r\n\r\nSECOND FRIEND.\r\nMy most honourable lord, I am e’en sick of shame that when your\r\nlordship this other day sent to me I was so unfortunate a beggar.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nThink not on’t, sir.\r\n\r\nSECOND FRIEND.\r\nIf you had sent but two hours before—\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nLet it not cumber your better remembrance.\r\n\r\n[_The banquet brought in._]\r\n\r\nCome, bring in all together.\r\n\r\nSECOND FRIEND.\r\nAll covered dishes!\r\n\r\nFIRST FRIEND.\r\nRoyal cheer, I warrant you.\r\n\r\nTHIRD FRIEND.\r\nDoubt not that, if money and the season can yield it.\r\n\r\nFIRST FRIEND.\r\nHow do you? What’s the news?\r\n\r\nTHIRD FRIEND.\r\nAlcibiades is banished. Hear you of it?\r\n\r\nFIRST AND SECOND FRIENDS.\r\nAlcibiades banished?\r\n\r\nTHIRD FRIEND.\r\n’Tis so, be sure of it.\r\n\r\nFIRST FRIEND.\r\nHow, how?\r\n\r\nSECOND FRIEND.\r\nI pray you, upon what?\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nMy worthy friends, will you draw near?\r\n\r\nTHIRD FRIEND.\r\nI’ll tell you more anon. Here’s a noble feast toward.\r\n\r\nSECOND FRIEND.\r\nThis is the old man still.\r\n\r\nTHIRD FRIEND.\r\nWill’t hold, will’t hold?\r\n\r\nSECOND FRIEND.\r\nIt does, but time will—and so—\r\n\r\nTHIRD FRIEND.\r\nI do conceive.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nEach man to his stool with that spur as he would to the lip of his\r\nmistress. Your diet shall be in all places alike. Make not a city feast\r\nof it, to let the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place. Sit,\r\nsit. The gods require our thanks:\r\nYou great benefactors, sprinkle our society with thankfulness. For your\r\nown gifts make yourselves praised, but reserve still to give, lest your\r\ndeities be despised. Lend to each man enough, that one need not lend to\r\nanother; for, were your godheads to borrow of men, men would forsake\r\nthe gods. Make the meat be beloved more than the man that gives it. Let\r\nno assembly of twenty be without a score of villains. If there sit\r\ntwelve women at the table, let a dozen of them be as they are. The rest\r\nof your foes, O gods, the senators of Athens, together with the common\r\nlag of people, what is amiss in them, you gods, make suitable for\r\ndestruction. For these my present friends, as they are to me nothing,\r\nso in nothing bless them, and to nothing are they welcome.\r\nUncover, dogs, and lap.\r\n\r\n[_The dishes are uncovered and prove to be full of lukewarm water._]\r\n\r\nSOME SPEAK.\r\nWhat does his lordship mean?\r\n\r\nSOME OTHER.\r\nI know not.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nMay you a better feast never behold,\r\nYou knot of mouth-friends! Smoke and lukewarm water\r\nIs your perfection. This is Timon’s last,\r\nWho, stuck and spangled with your flatteries,\r\nWashes it off and sprinkles in your faces\r\nYour reeking villainy.\r\n\r\n[_Throws water in their faces._]\r\n\r\nLive loathed, and long,\r\nMost smiling, smooth, detested parasites,\r\nCourteous destroyers, affable wolves, meek bears,\r\nYou fools of fortune, trencher-friends, time’s flies,\r\nCap-and-knee slaves, vapours, and minute-jacks!\r\nOf man and beast the infinite malady\r\nCrust you quite o’er! [_They stand_.] What, dost thou go?\r\nSoft! Take thy physic first; thou too, and thou!\r\nStay, I will lend thee money, borrow none.\r\n\r\n[_He attacks them and forces them out._]\r\n\r\nWhat, all in motion? Henceforth be no feast\r\nWhereat a villain’s not a welcome guest.\r\nBurn, house! Sink Athens! Henceforth hated be\r\nOf Timon man and all humanity!\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nEnter Timon’s Friends, the Senators with other Lords.\r\n\r\nFIRST FRIEND.\r\nHow now, my lords?\r\n\r\nSECOND FRIEND.\r\nKnow you the quality of Lord Timon’s fury?\r\n\r\nTHIRD FRIEND.\r\nPush! Did you see my cap?\r\n\r\nFOURTH FRIEND.\r\nI have lost my gown.\r\n\r\nFIRST FRIEND.\r\nHe’s but a mad lord, and nought but humours sways him. He gave me a\r\njewel th’ other day, and now he has beat it out of my hat. Did you see\r\nmy jewel?\r\n\r\nTHIRD FRIEND.\r\nDid you see my cap?\r\n\r\nSECOND FRIEND.\r\nHere ’tis.\r\n\r\nFOURTH FRIEND.\r\nHere lies my gown.\r\n\r\nFIRST FRIEND.\r\nLet’s make no stay.\r\n\r\nSECOND FRIEND.\r\nLord Timon’s mad.\r\n\r\nTHIRD FRIEND.\r\nI feel’t upon my bones.\r\n\r\nFOURTH FRIEND.\r\nOne day he gives us diamonds, next day stones.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\nACT IV\r\n\r\nSCENE I. Without the walls of Athens\r\n\nEnter Timon.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nLet me look back upon thee. O thou wall\r\nThat girdles in those wolves, dive in the earth\r\nAnd fence not Athens! Matrons, turn incontinent!\r\nObedience fail in children! Slaves and fools,\r\nPluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench\r\nAnd minister in their steads! To general filths\r\nConvert, o’ th’ instant, green virginity,\r\nDo’t in your parents’ eyes! Bankrupts, hold fast;\r\nRather than render back, out with your knives\r\nAnd cut your trusters’ throats! Bound servants, steal!\r\nLarge-handed robbers your grave masters are,\r\nAnd pill by law. Maid, to thy master’s bed,\r\nThy mistress is o’ th’ brothel. Son of sixteen,\r\nPluck the lined crutch from thy old limping sire,\r\nWith it beat out his brains! Piety and fear,\r\nReligion to the gods, peace, justice, truth,\r\nDomestic awe, night-rest and neighbourhood,\r\nInstruction, manners, mysteries and trades,\r\nDegrees, observances, customs and laws,\r\nDecline to your confounding contraries,\r\nAnd let confusion live! Plagues incident to men,\r\nYour potent and infectious fevers heap\r\nOn Athens, ripe for stroke! Thou cold sciatica,\r\nCripple our senators, that their limbs may halt\r\nAs lamely as their manners! Lust and liberty,\r\nCreep in the minds and marrows of our youth,\r\nThat ’gainst the stream of virtue they may strive\r\nAnd drown themselves in riot! Itches, blains,\r\nSow all th’ Athenian bosoms, and their crop\r\nBe general leprosy! Breath infect breath,\r\nThat their society, as their friendship, may\r\nBe merely poison! Nothing I’ll bear from thee\r\nBut nakedness, thou detestable town!\r\nTake thou that too, with multiplying bans!\r\nTimon will to the woods, where he shall find\r\nTh’ unkindest beast more kinder than mankind.\r\nThe gods confound—hear me, you good gods all!—\r\nTh’ Athenians both within and out that wall,\r\nAnd grant, as Timon grows, his hate may grow\r\nTo the whole race of mankind, high and low!\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. Athens. A room in Timon’s house\r\n\r\nEnter Flavius with two or three Servants.\r\n\r\nFIRST SERVANT.\r\nHear you, Master Steward, where’s our master?\r\nAre we undone, cast off, nothing remaining?\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS.\r\nAlack, my fellows, what should I say to you?\r\nLet me be recorded by the righteous gods,\r\nI am as poor as you.\r\n\r\nFIRST SERVANT.\r\nSuch a house broke?\r\nSo noble a master fall’n? All gone, and not\r\nOne friend to take his fortune by the arm\r\nAnd go along with him?\r\n\r\nSECOND SERVANT.\r\nAs we do turn our backs\r\nFrom our companion, thrown into his grave,\r\nSo his familiars to his buried fortunes\r\nSlink all away, leave their false vows with him,\r\nLike empty purses picked; and his poor self,\r\nA dedicated beggar to the air,\r\nWith his disease of all-shunned poverty,\r\nWalks, like contempt, alone.—More of our fellows.\r\n\r\nEnter other Servants.\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS.\r\nAll broken implements of a ruined house.\r\n\r\nTHIRD SERVANT.\r\nYet do our hearts wear Timon’s livery.\r\nThat see I by our faces. We are fellows still,\r\nServing alike in sorrow. Leaked is our bark,\r\nAnd we, poor mates, stand on the dying deck,\r\nHearing the surges threat. We must all part\r\nInto this sea of air.\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS.\r\nGood fellows all,\r\nThe latest of my wealth I’ll share amongst you.\r\nWherever we shall meet, for Timon’s sake\r\nLet’s yet be fellows. Let’s shake our heads and say,\r\nAs ’twere a knell unto our master’s fortune,\r\n“We have seen better days.” Let each take some.\r\n\r\n[_Offering them money._]\r\n\r\nNay, put out all your hands. Not one word more.\r\nThus part we rich in sorrow, parting poor.\r\n\r\n[_They embrace and part several ways._]\r\n\r\nO, the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us!\r\nWho would not wish to be from wealth exempt,\r\nSince riches point to misery and contempt?\r\nWho would be so mocked with glory, or to live\r\nBut in a dream of friendship,\r\nTo have his pomp and all what state compounds\r\nBut only painted, like his varnished friends?\r\nPoor honest lord, brought low by his own heart,\r\nUndone by goodness! Strange, unusual blood\r\nWhen man’s worst sin is he does too much good!\r\nWho then dares to be half so kind again?\r\nFor bounty, that makes gods, does still mar men.\r\nMy dearest lord, blessed to be most accursed,\r\nRich only to be wretched, thy great fortunes\r\nAre made thy chief afflictions. Alas, kind lord,\r\nHe’s flung in rage from this ingrateful seat\r\nOf monstrous friends;\r\nNor has he with him to supply his life,\r\nOr that which can command it.\r\nI’ll follow and inquire him out.\r\nI’ll ever serve his mind with my best will.\r\nWhilst I have gold, I’ll be his steward still.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. Woods and caves near the sea-shore\r\n\r\nEnter Timon in the woods.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nO blessed breeding sun, draw from the earth\r\nRotten humidity, below thy sister’s orb\r\nInfect the air! Twinned brothers of one womb,\r\nWhose procreation, residence and birth\r\nScarce is dividant, touch them with several fortunes,\r\nThe greater scorns the lesser. Not nature,\r\nTo whom all sores lay siege, can bear great fortune\r\nBut by contempt of nature.\r\nRaise me this beggar, and deny’t that lord;\r\nThe senator shall bear contempt hereditary,\r\nThe beggar native honour.\r\nIt is the pasture lards the rother’s sides,\r\nThe want that makes him lean. Who dares, who dares\r\nIn purity of manhood stand upright\r\nAnd say, “This man’s a flatterer”? If one be,\r\nSo are they all, for every grece of fortune\r\nIs smoothed by that below. The learned pate\r\nDucks to the golden fool. All’s obliquy.\r\nThere’s nothing level in our cursed natures\r\nBut direct villainy. Therefore be abhorred\r\nAll feasts, societies, and throngs of men!\r\nHis semblable, yea, himself, Timon disdains.\r\nDestruction fang mankind! Earth, yield me roots!\r\n\r\n[_Digs in the earth._]\r\n\r\nWho seeks for better of thee, sauce his palate\r\nWith thy most operant poison! What is here?\r\nGold? Yellow, glittering, precious gold?\r\nNo, gods, I am no idle votarist.\r\nRoots, you clear heavens! Thus much of this will make\r\nBlack white, foul fair, wrong right,\r\nBase noble, old young, coward valiant.\r\nHa, you gods, why this? What this, you gods? Why, this\r\nWill lug your priests and servants from your sides,\r\nPluck stout men’s pillows from below their heads.\r\nThis yellow slave\r\nWill knit and break religions, bless th’ accursed,\r\nMake the hoar leprosy adored, place thieves\r\nAnd give them title, knee, and approbation\r\nWith senators on the bench. This is it\r\nThat makes the wappened widow wed again;\r\nShe whom the spittle-house and ulcerous sores\r\nWould cast the gorge at, this embalms and spices\r\nTo th’ April day again. Come, damned earth,\r\nThou common whore of mankind, that puts odds\r\nAmong the rout of nations, I will make thee\r\nDo thy right nature.\r\n\r\n[_March afar off._]\r\n\r\nHa? A drum? Thou’rt quick,\r\nBut yet I’ll bury thee. Thou’lt go, strong thief,\r\nWhen gouty keepers of thee cannot stand.\r\nNay, stay thou out for earnest.\r\n\r\n[_Keeping some gold._]\r\n\r\nEnter Alcibiades with drum and fife, in warlike manner, and Phrynia and\r\nTimandra.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nWhat art thou there? Speak.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nA beast, as thou art. The canker gnaw thy heart\r\nFor showing me again the eyes of man!\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nWhat is thy name? Is man so hateful to thee\r\nThat art thyself a man?\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nI am Misanthropos and hate mankind.\r\nFor thy part, I do wish thou wert a dog,\r\nThat I might love thee something.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nI know thee well,\r\nBut in thy fortunes am unlearned and strange.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nI know thee too, and more than that I know thee\r\nI not desire to know. Follow thy drum,\r\nWith man’s blood paint the ground gules, gules.\r\nReligious canons, civil laws are cruel,\r\nThen what should war be? This fell whore of thine\r\nHath in her more destruction than thy sword,\r\nFor all her cherubin look.\r\n\r\nPHRYNIA.\r\nThy lips rot off!\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nI will not kiss thee, then the rot returns\r\nTo thine own lips again.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nHow came the noble Timon to this change?\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nAs the moon does, by wanting light to give.\r\nBut then renew I could not like the moon;\r\nThere were no suns to borrow of.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nNoble Timon,\r\nWhat friendship may I do thee?\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nNone, but to maintain my opinion.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nWhat is it, Timon?\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nPromise me friendship, but perform none. If thou wilt not promise, the\r\ngods plague thee, for thou art a man. If thou dost perform, confound\r\nthee, for thou art a man.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nI have heard in some sort of thy miseries.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nThou saw’st them when I had prosperity.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nI see them now; then was a blessed time.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nAs thine is now, held with a brace of harlots.\r\n\r\nTIMANDRA.\r\nIs this th’ Athenian minion whom the world\r\nVoiced so regardfully?\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nArt thou Timandra?\r\n\r\nTIMANDRA.\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nBe a whore still, they love thee not that use thee;\r\nGive them diseases, leaving with thee their lust.\r\nMake use of thy salt hours. Season the slaves\r\nFor tubs and baths, bring down rose-cheeked youth\r\nTo the tub-fast and the diet.\r\n\r\nTIMANDRA.\r\nHang thee, monster!\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nPardon him, sweet Timandra, for his wits\r\nAre drowned and lost in his calamities.\r\nI have but little gold of late, brave Timon,\r\nThe want whereof doth daily make revolt\r\nIn my penurious band. I have heard and grieved\r\nHow cursed Athens, mindless of thy worth,\r\nForgetting thy great deeds when neighbour states,\r\nBut for thy sword and fortune, trod upon them—\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nI prithee, beat thy drum and get thee gone.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nI am thy friend and pity thee, dear Timon.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nHow dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble?\r\nI had rather be alone.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nWhy, fare thee well.\r\nHere is some gold for thee.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nKeep it, I cannot eat it.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nWhen I have laid proud Athens on a heap—\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nWarr’st thou ’gainst Athens?\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nAy, Timon, and have cause.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nThe gods confound them all in thy conquest,\r\nAnd thee after, when thou hast conquered!\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nWhy me, Timon?\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nThat by killing of villains\r\nThou wast born to conquer my country.\r\nPut up thy gold. Go on, here’s gold, go on.\r\nBe as a planetary plague when Jove\r\nWill o’er some high-viced city hang his poison\r\nIn the sick air. Let not thy sword skip one.\r\nPity not honoured age for his white beard;\r\nHe is an usurer. Strike me the counterfeit matron;\r\nIt is her habit only that is honest,\r\nHerself’s a bawd. Let not the virgin’s cheek\r\nMake soft thy trenchant sword, for those milk paps\r\nThat through the window-bars bore at men’s eyes,\r\nAre not within the leaf of pity writ,\r\nBut set them down horrible traitors. Spare not the babe,\r\nWhose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy;\r\nThink it a bastard whom the oracle\r\nHath doubtfully pronounced thy throat shall cut,\r\nAnd mince it sans remorse. Swear against objects;\r\nPut armour on thine ears and on thine eyes,\r\nWhose proof nor yells of mothers, maids, nor babes,\r\nNor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding,\r\nShall pierce a jot. There’s gold to pay thy soldiers.\r\nMake large confusion and, thy fury spent,\r\nConfounded be thyself! Speak not, be gone.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nHast thou gold yet? I’ll take the gold thou giv’st me,\r\nNot all thy counsel.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nDost thou or dost thou not, heaven’s curse upon thee!\r\n\r\nPHRYNIA AND TIMANDRA.\r\nGive us some gold, good Timon.\r\nHast thou more?\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nEnough to make a whore forswear her trade,\r\nAnd to make whores a bawd. Hold up, you sluts,\r\nYour aprons mountant. You are not oathable,\r\nAlthough I know you’ll swear—terribly swear\r\nInto strong shudders and to heavenly agues\r\nTh’ immortal gods that hear you. Spare your oaths,\r\nI’ll trust to your conditions. Be whores still,\r\nAnd he whose pious breath seeks to convert you,\r\nBe strong in whore, allure him, burn him up;\r\nLet your close fire predominate his smoke,\r\nAnd be no turncoats. Yet may your pains six months,\r\nBe quite contrary. And thatch your poor thin roofs\r\nWith burdens of the dead—some that were hanged,\r\nNo matter; wear them, betray with them. Whore still,\r\nPaint till a horse may mire upon your face.\r\nA pox of wrinkles!\r\n\r\nPHRYNIA AND TIMANDRA.\r\nWell, more gold. What then?\r\nBelieve’t that we’ll do anything for gold.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nConsumptions sow\r\nIn hollow bones of man; strike their sharp shins,\r\nAnd mar men’s spurring. Crack the lawyer’s voice,\r\nThat he may never more false title plead\r\nNor sound his quillets shrilly. Hoar the flamen,\r\nThat scolds against the quality of flesh\r\nAnd not believes himself. Down with the nose,\r\nDown with it flat, take the bridge quite away\r\nOf him that, his particular to foresee,\r\nSmells from the general weal. Make curled-pate ruffians bald,\r\nAnd let the unscarred braggarts of the war\r\nDerive some pain from you. Plague all,\r\nThat your activity may defeat and quell\r\nThe source of all erection. There’s more gold.\r\nDo you damn others, and let this damn you,\r\nAnd ditches grave you all!\r\n\r\nPHRYNIA AND TIMANDRA.\r\nMore counsel with more money, bounteous Timon.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nMore whore, more mischief first! I have given you earnest.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nStrike up the drum towards Athens. Farewell, Timon.\r\nIf I thrive well, I’ll visit thee again.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nIf I hope well, I’ll never see thee more.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nI never did thee harm.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nYes, thou spok’st well of me.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nCall’st thou that harm?\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nMen daily find it. Get thee away, and take\r\nThy beagles with thee.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nWe but offend him. Strike.\r\n\r\n[_Drum beats. Exeunt all but Timon._]\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nThat nature, being sick of man’s unkindness,\r\nShould yet be hungry! [_He digs_.] Common mother, thou,\r\nWhose womb unmeasurable and infinite breast\r\nTeems and feeds all; whose selfsame mettle\r\nWhereof thy proud child, arrogant man, is puffed,\r\nEngenders the black toad and adder blue,\r\nThe gilded newt and eyeless venomed worm,\r\nWith all the abhorred births below crisp heaven\r\nWhereon Hyperion’s quickening fire doth shine:\r\nYield him who all thy human sons doth hate,\r\nFrom forth thy plenteous bosom, one poor root!\r\nEnsear thy fertile and conceptious womb,\r\nLet it no more bring out ingrateful man.\r\nGo great with tigers, dragons, wolves, and bears;\r\nTeem with new monsters, whom thy upward face\r\nHath to the marbled mansion all above\r\nNever presented. O, a root, dear thanks!\r\nDry up thy marrows, vines and plough-torn leas,\r\nWhereof ingrateful man, with liquorish draughts\r\nAnd morsels unctuous greases his pure mind,\r\nThat from it all consideration slips—\r\n\r\nEnter Apemantus.\r\n\r\nMore man? Plague, plague!\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nI was directed hither. Men report\r\nThou dost affect my manners and dost use them.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\n’Tis, then, because thou dost not keep a dog\r\nWhom I would imitate. Consumption catch thee!\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nThis is in thee a nature but infected,\r\nA poor unmanly melancholy sprung\r\nFrom change of fortune. Why this spade, this place?\r\nThis slave-like habit and these looks of care?\r\nThy flatterers yet wear silk, drink wine, lie soft,\r\nHug their diseased perfumes, and have forgot\r\nThat ever Timon was. Shame not these woods\r\nBy putting on the cunning of a carper.\r\nBe thou a flatterer now, and seek to thrive\r\nBy that which has undone thee. Hinge thy knee\r\nAnd let his very breath whom thou’lt observe\r\nBlow off thy cap; praise his most vicious strain,\r\nAnd call it excellent. Thou wast told thus;\r\nThou gav’st thine ears, like tapsters that bade welcome,\r\nTo knaves and all approachers. ’Tis most just\r\nThat thou turn rascal; had’st thou wealth again,\r\nRascals should have’t. Do not assume my likeness.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nWere I like thee, I’d throw away myself.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nThou hast cast away thyself, being like thyself\r\nA madman so long, now a fool. What, think’st\r\nThat the bleak air, thy boisterous chamberlain,\r\nWill put thy shirt on warm? Will these mossed trees,\r\nThat have outlived the eagle, page thy heels\r\nAnd skip when thou point’st out? Will the cold brook,\r\nCandied with ice, caudle thy morning taste\r\nTo cure thy o’ernight’s surfeit? Call the creatures\r\nWhose naked natures live in all the spite\r\nOf wreakful heaven, whose bare unhoused trunks,\r\nTo the conflicting elements exposed,\r\nAnswer mere nature, bid them flatter thee.\r\nO, thou shalt find—\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nA fool of thee. Depart.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nI love thee better now than e’er I did.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nI hate thee worse.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nThou flatter’st misery.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nI flatter not, but say thou art a caitiff.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nWhy dost thou seek me out?\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nTo vex thee.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nAlways a villain’s office or a fool’s.\r\nDost please thyself in’t?\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nAy.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nWhat, a knave too?\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nIf thou didst put this sour cold habit on\r\nTo castigate thy pride, ’twere well; but thou\r\nDost it enforcedly. Thou’dst courtier be again\r\nWert thou not beggar. Willing misery\r\nOutlives incertain pomp, is crowned before;\r\nThe one is filling still, never complete,\r\nThe other, at high wish. Best state, contentless,\r\nHath a distracted and most wretched being,\r\nWorse than the worst, content.\r\nThou shouldst desire to die, being miserable.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nNot by his breath that is more miserable.\r\nThou art a slave whom Fortune’s tender arm\r\nWith favour never clasped, but bred a dog.\r\nHadst thou, like us from our first swath, proceeded\r\nThe sweet degrees that this brief world affords\r\nTo such as may the passive drugs of it\r\nFreely command, thou wouldst have plunged thyself\r\nIn general riot, melted down thy youth\r\nIn different beds of lust and never learned\r\nThe icy precepts of respect, but followed\r\nThe sugared game before thee. But myself—\r\nWho had the world as my confectionary,\r\nThe mouths, the tongues, the eyes and hearts of men\r\nAt duty, more than I could frame employment,\r\nThat numberless upon me stuck as leaves\r\nDo on the oak, have with one winter’s brush\r\nFell from their boughs and left me open, bare\r\nFor every storm that blows—I to bear this,\r\nThat never knew but better, is some burden.\r\nThy nature did commence in sufferance, time\r\nHath made thee hard in’t. Why shouldst thou hate men?\r\nThey never flattered thee. What hast thou given?\r\nIf thou wilt curse, thy father, that poor rag,\r\nMust be thy subject, who in spite put stuff\r\nTo some she-beggar and compounded thee\r\nPoor rogue hereditary. Hence, be gone!\r\nIf thou hadst not been born the worst of men,\r\nThou hadst been a knave and flatterer.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nArt thou proud yet?\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nAy, that I am not thee.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nI, that I was no prodigal.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nI, that I am one now.\r\nWere all the wealth I have shut up in thee,\r\nI’d give thee leave to hang it. Get thee gone.\r\nThat the whole life of Athens were in this!\r\nThus would I eat it.\r\n\r\n[_Eats a root._]\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nHere, I will mend thy feast.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nFirst mend my company, take away thyself.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nSo I shall mend mine own, by th’ lack of thine.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\n’Tis not well mended so, it is but botched.\r\nIf not, I would it were.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nWhat wouldst thou have to Athens?\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nThee thither in a whirlwind. If thou wilt,\r\nTell them there I have gold. Look, so I have.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nHere is no use for gold.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nThe best and truest,\r\nFor here it sleeps and does no hired harm.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nWhere liest a-nights, Timon?\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nUnder that’s above me. Where feed’st thou a-days, Apemantus?\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nWhere my stomach finds meat, or rather where I eat it.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nWould poison were obedient and knew my mind!\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nWhere wouldst thou send it?\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nTo sauce thy dishes.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nThe middle of humanity thou never knewest, but the extremity of both\r\nends. When thou wast in thy gilt and thy perfume, they mocked thee for\r\ntoo much curiosity; in thy rags thou know’st none, but art despised for\r\nthe contrary. There’s a medlar for thee. Eat it.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nOn what I hate I feed not.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nDost hate a medlar?\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nAy, though it look like thee.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nAn thou’dst hated medlars sooner, thou shouldst have loved thyself\r\nbetter now. What man didst thou ever know unthrift that was beloved\r\nafter his means?\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nWho, without those means thou talk’st of, didst thou ever know beloved?\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nMyself.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nI understand thee. Thou hadst some means to keep a dog.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nWhat things in the world canst thou nearest compare to thy flatterers?\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nWomen nearest; but men—men are the things themselves. What wouldst thou\r\ndo with the world, Apemantus, if it lay in thy power?\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nGive it the beasts, to be rid of the men.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nWouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of men and remain a\r\nbeast with the beasts?\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nAy, Timon.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nA beastly ambition, which the gods grant thee t’ attain to. If thou\r\nwert the lion, the fox would beguile thee; if thou wert the lamb, the\r\nfox would eat thee; if thou wert the fox, the lion would suspect thee\r\nwhen peradventure thou wert accused by the ass; if thou wert the ass,\r\nthy dulness would torment thee, and still thou lived’st but as a\r\nbreakfast to the wolf; if thou wert the wolf, thy greediness would\r\nafflict thee, and oft thou shouldst hazard thy life for thy dinner.\r\nWert thou the unicorn, pride and wrath would confound thee and make\r\nthine own self the conquest of thy fury; wert thou a bear, thou wouldst\r\nbe killed by the horse; wert thou a horse, thou wouldst be seized by\r\nthe leopard; wert thou a leopard, thou wert germane to the lion, and\r\nthe spots of thy kindred were jurors on thy life. All thy safety were\r\nremotion, and thy defence absence. What beast couldst thou be that were\r\nnot subject to a beast? And what beast art thou already that seest not\r\nthy loss in transformation!\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nIf thou couldst please me with speaking to me, thou mightst have hit\r\nupon it here. The commonwealth of Athens is become a forest of beasts.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nHow has the ass broke the wall, that thou art out of the city?\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nYonder comes a poet and a painter. The plague of company light upon\r\nthee! I will fear to catch it, and give way. When I know not what else\r\nto do, I’ll see thee again.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nWhen there is nothing living but thee, thou shalt be welcome. I had\r\nrather be a beggar’s dog than Apemantus.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nThou art the cap of all the fools alive.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nWould thou wert clean enough to spit upon!\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nA plague on thee! Thou art too bad to curse.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nAll villains that do stand by thee are pure.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nThere is no leprosy but what thou speak’st.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nIf I name thee,\r\nI’ll beat thee, but I should infect my hands.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nI would my tongue could rot them off!\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nAway, thou issue of a mangy dog!\r\nCholer does kill me that thou art alive.\r\nI swoon to see thee.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nWould thou wouldst burst!\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nAway, thou tedious rogue!\r\nI am sorry I shall lose a stone by thee.\r\n\r\n[_Throws a stone at him._]\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nBeast!\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nSlave!\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nToad!\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nRogue, rogue, rogue!\r\nI am sick of this false world, and will love nought\r\nBut even the mere necessities upon’t.\r\nThen, Timon, presently prepare thy grave.\r\nLie where the light foam of the sea may beat\r\nThy gravestone daily. Make thine epitaph,\r\nThat death in me at others’ lives may laugh.\r\n[_To the gold._] O thou sweet king-killer and dear divorce\r\n’Twixt natural son and sire; thou bright defiler\r\nOf Hymen’s purest bed, thou valiant Mars;\r\nThou ever young, fresh, loved, and delicate wooer,\r\nWhose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow\r\nThat lies on Dian’s lap; thou visible god,\r\nThat solder’st close impossibilities\r\nAnd mak’st them kiss, that speak’st with every tongue\r\nTo every purpose! O thou touch of hearts,\r\nThink thy slave man rebels, and by thy virtue\r\nSet them into confounding odds, that beasts\r\nMay have the world in empire!\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nWould ’twere so!\r\nBut not till I am dead. I’ll say thou’st gold;\r\nThou wilt be thronged to shortly.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nThronged to?\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nAy.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nThy back, I prithee.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nLive and love thy misery.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nLong live so, and so die! I am quit.\r\n\r\nAPEMANTUS.\r\nMore things like men. Eat, Timon, and abhor them.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Apemantus._]\r\n\r\nEnter Banditti.\r\n\r\nFIRST BANDIT.\r\nWhere should he have this gold? It is some poor fragment, some slender\r\nort of his remainder. The mere want of gold and the falling-from of his\r\nfriends drove him into this melancholy.\r\n\r\nSECOND BANDIT.\r\nIt is noised he hath a mass of treasure.\r\n\r\nTHIRD BANDIT.\r\nLet us make the assay upon him. If he care not for’t, he will supply us\r\neasily; if he covetously reserve it, how shall’s get it?\r\n\r\nSECOND BANDIT.\r\nTrue, for he bears it not about him. ’Tis hid.\r\n\r\nFIRST BANDIT.\r\nIs not this he?\r\n\r\nBANDITTI.\r\nWhere?\r\n\r\nSECOND BANDIT.\r\n’Tis his description.\r\n\r\nTHIRD BANDIT.\r\nHe; I know him.\r\n\r\nBANDITTI.\r\nSave thee, Timon!\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nNow, thieves?\r\n\r\nBANDITTI.\r\nSoldiers, not thieves.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nBoth too, and women’s sons.\r\n\r\nBANDITTI.\r\nWe are not thieves, but men that much do want.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nYour greatest want is, you want much of meat.\r\nWhy should you want? Behold, the earth hath roots,\r\nWithin this mile break forth a hundred springs,\r\nThe oaks bear mast, the briars scarlet hips,\r\nThe bounteous housewife Nature on each bush\r\nLays her full mess before you. Want? Why want?\r\n\r\nFIRST BANDIT.\r\nWe cannot live on grass, on berries, water,\r\nAs beasts and birds and fishes.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nNor on the beasts themselves, the birds, and fishes;\r\nYou must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con\r\nThat you are thieves professed, that you work not\r\nIn holier shapes, for there is boundless theft\r\nIn limited professions. Rascal thieves,\r\nHere’s gold. Go, suck the subtle blood o’ th’ grape\r\nTill the high fever seethe your blood to froth,\r\nAnd so scape hanging. Trust not the physician;\r\nHis antidotes are poison, and he slays\r\nMore than you rob. Take wealth and lives together,\r\nDo villainy, do, since you protest to do’t,\r\nLike workmen. I’ll example you with thievery.\r\nThe sun’s a thief and with his great attraction\r\nRobs the vast sea; the moon’s an arrant thief,\r\nAnd her pale fire she snatches from the sun;\r\nThe sea’s a thief, whose liquid surge resolves\r\nThe moon into salt tears; the earth’s a thief,\r\nThat feeds and breeds by a composture stol’n\r\nFrom general excrement. Each thing’s a thief.\r\nThe laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power\r\nHas unchecked theft. Love not yourselves; away!\r\nRob one another. There’s more gold. Cut throats,\r\nAll that you meet are thieves. To Athens go,\r\nBreak open shops, nothing can you steal\r\nBut thieves do lose it. Steal no less for this I give you,\r\nAnd gold confound you howsoe’er! Amen.\r\n\r\nTHIRD BANDIT.\r\nHas almost charmed me from my profession by persuading me to it.\r\n\r\nFIRST BANDIT.\r\n’Tis in the malice of mankind that he thus advises us, not to have us\r\nthrive in our mystery.\r\n\r\nSECOND BANDIT.\r\nI’ll believe him as an enemy and give over my trade.\r\n\r\nFIRST BANDIT.\r\nLet us first see peace in Athens. There is no time so miserable but a\r\nman may be true.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Banditti._]\r\n\r\nEnter Flavius.\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS.\r\nO you gods!\r\nIs yond despised and ruinous man my lord?\r\nFull of decay and failing? O monument\r\nAnd wonder of good deeds evilly bestowed!\r\nWhat an alteration of honour has desperate want made!\r\nWhat viler thing upon the earth than friends\r\nWho can bring noblest minds to basest ends!\r\nHow rarely does it meet with this time’s guise,\r\nWhen man was wished to love his enemies!\r\nGrant I may ever love, and rather woo\r\nThose that would mischief me than those that do!\r\nHe has caught me in his eye. I will present\r\nMy honest grief unto him and as my lord\r\nStill serve him with my life.—My dearest master!\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nAway! What art thou?\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS.\r\nHave you forgot me, sir?\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nWhy dost ask that? I have forgot all men.\r\nThen, if thou grant’st thou’rt a man, I have forgot thee.\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS.\r\nAn honest poor servant of yours.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nThen I know thee not.\r\nI never had honest man about me. I; all\r\nI kept were knaves to serve in meat to villains.\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS.\r\nThe gods are witness,\r\nNe’er did poor steward wear a truer grief\r\nFor his undone lord than mine eyes for you.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nWhat, dost thou weep? Come nearer then. I love thee\r\nBecause thou art a woman and disclaim’st\r\nFlinty mankind, whose eyes do never give\r\nBut thorough lust and laughter. Pity’s sleeping.\r\nStrange times that weep with laughing, not with weeping!\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS.\r\nI beg of you to know me, good my lord,\r\nT’ accept my grief, and whilst this poor wealth lasts\r\nTo entertain me as your steward still.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nHad I a steward\r\nSo true, so just, and now so comfortable?\r\nIt almost turns my dangerous nature mild.\r\nLet me behold thy face. Surely this man\r\nWas born of woman.\r\nForgive my general and exceptless rashness,\r\nYou perpetual sober gods! I do proclaim\r\nOne honest man, mistake me not, but one;\r\nNo more, I pray, and he’s a steward.\r\nHow fain would I have hated all mankind,\r\nAnd thou redeem’st thyself. But all, save thee,\r\nI fell with curses.\r\nMethinks thou art more honest now than wise,\r\nFor by oppressing and betraying me\r\nThou mightst have sooner got another service;\r\nFor many so arrive at second masters\r\nUpon their first lord’s neck. But tell me true—\r\nFor I must ever doubt, though ne’er so sure—\r\nIs not thy kindness subtle, covetous,\r\nA usuring kindness and as rich men deal gifts,\r\nExpecting in return twenty for one?\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS.\r\nNo, my most worthy master, in whose breast\r\nDoubt and suspect, alas, are placed too late.\r\nYou should have feared false times when you did feast,\r\nSuspect still comes where an estate is least.\r\nThat which I show, heaven knows, is merely love,\r\nDuty and zeal to your unmatched mind,\r\nCare of your food and living. And believe it,\r\nMy most honoured lord,\r\nFor any benefit that points to me,\r\nEither in hope or present, I’d exchange\r\nFor this one wish, that you had power and wealth\r\nTo requite me by making rich yourself.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nLook thee, ’tis so! Thou singly honest man,\r\nHere, take. The gods out of my misery\r\nHave sent thee treasure. Go, live rich and happy,\r\nBut thus conditioned: thou shalt build from men;\r\nHate all, curse all, show charity to none,\r\nBut let the famished flesh slide from the bone\r\nEre thou relieve the beggar; give to dogs\r\nWhat thou deniest to men; let prisons swallow ’em,\r\nDebts wither ’em to nothing; be men like blasted woods,\r\nAnd may diseases lick up their false bloods!\r\nAnd so farewell and thrive.\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS.\r\nO, let me stay\r\nAnd comfort you, my master.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nIf thou hat’st curses,\r\nStay not. Fly whilst thou’rt blest and free.\r\nNe’er see thou man, and let me ne’er see thee.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt severally._]\r\n\nACT V\r\n\r\nSCENE I. The woods. Before Timon’s cave\r\n\nEnter Poet and Painter.\r\n\r\nPAINTER.\r\nAs I took note of the place, it cannot be far where he abides.\r\n\r\nPOET.\r\nWhat’s to be thought of him? Does the rumour hold for true that he is\r\nso full of gold?\r\n\r\nPAINTER.\r\nCertain. Alcibiades reports it; Phrynia and Timandra had gold of him.\r\nHe likewise enriched poor straggling soldiers with great quantity. ’Tis\r\nsaid he gave unto his steward a mighty sum.\r\n\r\nPOET.\r\nThen this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends?\r\n\r\nPAINTER.\r\nNothing else. You shall see him a palm in Athens again, and flourish\r\nwith the highest. Therefore ’tis not amiss we tender our loves to him\r\nin this supposed distress of his. It will show honestly in us and is\r\nvery likely to load our purposes with what they travail for, if it be a\r\njust and true report that goes of his having.\r\n\r\nPOET.\r\nWhat have you now to present unto him?\r\n\r\nPAINTER.\r\nNothing at this time but my visitation; only I will promise him an\r\nexcellent piece.\r\n\r\nPOET.\r\nI must serve him so too, tell him of an intent that’s coming toward\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nPAINTER.\r\nGood as the best. Promising is the very air o’ th’ time; it opens the\r\neyes of expectation. Performance is ever the duller for his act and,\r\nbut in the plainer and simpler kind of people, the deed of saying is\r\nquite out of use. To promise is most courtly and fashionable;\r\nperformance is a kind of will or testament which argues a great\r\nsickness in his judgment that makes it.\r\n\r\nEnter Timon from his cave.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\n[_Aside_.] Excellent workman! Thou canst not paint a man so bad as is\r\nthyself.\r\n\r\nPOET.\r\nI am thinking what I shall say I have provided for him. It must be a\r\npersonating of himself, a satire against the softness of prosperity,\r\nwith a discovery of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and\r\nopulency.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\n[_Aside_.] Must thou needs stand for a villain in thine own work? Wilt\r\nthou whip thine own faults in other men? Do so, I have gold for thee.\r\n\r\nPOET.\r\nNay, let’s seek him.\r\nThen do we sin against our own estate\r\nWhen we may profit meet and come too late.\r\n\r\nPAINTER.\r\nTrue.\r\nWhen the day serves, before black-cornered night,\r\nFind what thou want’st by free and offered light.\r\nCome.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\n[_Aside_.] I’ll meet you at the turn. What a god’s gold,\r\nThat he is worshipped in a baser temple\r\nThan where swine feed!\r\n’Tis thou that rigg’st the bark and plough’st the foam,\r\nSettlest admired reverence in a slave.\r\nTo thee be worship, and thy saints for aye\r\nBe crowned with plagues, that thee alone obey!\r\nFit I meet them.\r\n\r\n[_He comes forward._]\r\n\r\nPOET.\r\nHail, worthy Timon!\r\n\r\nPAINTER.\r\nOur late noble master!\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nHave I once lived to see two honest men?\r\n\r\nPOET.\r\nSir,\r\nHaving often of your open bounty tasted,\r\nHearing you were retired, your friends fall’n off,\r\nWhose thankless natures—O abhorred spirits!\r\nNot all the whips of heaven are large enough—\r\nWhat, to you,\r\nWhose star-like nobleness gave life and influence\r\nTo their whole being? I am rapt and cannot cover\r\nThe monstrous bulk of this ingratitude\r\nWith any size of words.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nLet it go naked. Men may see’t the better.\r\nYou that are honest, by being what you are,\r\nMake them best seen and known.\r\n\r\nPAINTER.\r\nHe and myself\r\nHave travailed in the great shower of your gifts,\r\nAnd sweetly felt it.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nAy, you are honest men.\r\n\r\nPAINTER.\r\nWe are hither come to offer you our service.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nMost honest men! Why, how shall I requite you?\r\nCan you eat roots and drink cold water? No?\r\n\r\nBOTH.\r\nWhat we can do we’ll do, to do you service.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nYe’re honest men. Ye’ve heard that I have gold,\r\nI am sure you have. Speak truth, you’re honest men.\r\n\r\nPAINTER.\r\nSo it is said, my noble lord; but therefore\r\nCame not my friend nor I.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nGood honest men!

Thou’rt indeed the best,\r\nThou counterfeit’st most lively.\r\n\r\nPAINTER.\r\nSo so, my lord.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nE’en so, sir, as I say. [_To the Poet_.] And for thy fiction,\r\nWhy, thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth\r\nThat thou art even natural in thine art.\r\nBut for all this, my honest-natured friends,\r\nI must needs say you have a little fault.\r\nMarry, ’tis not monstrous in you, neither wish I\r\nYou take much pains to mend.\r\n\r\nBOTH.\r\nBeseech your honour\r\nTo make it known to us.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nYou’ll take it ill.\r\n\r\nBOTH.\r\nMost thankfully, my lord.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nWill you indeed?\r\n\r\nBOTH.\r\nDoubt it not, worthy lord.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nThere’s never a one of you but trusts a knave\r\nThat mightily deceives you.\r\n\r\nBOTH.\r\nDo we, my lord?\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nAy, and you hear him cog, see him dissemble,\r\nKnow his gross patchery, love him, feed him,\r\nKeep in your bosom, yet remain assured\r\nThat he’s a made-up villain.\r\n\r\nPAINTER.\r\nI know not such, my lord.\r\n\r\nPOET.\r\nNor I.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nLook you, I love you well. I’ll give you gold.\r\nRid me these villains from your companies,\r\nHang them or stab them, drown them in a draught,\r\nConfound them by some course, and come to me,\r\nI’ll give you gold enough.\r\n\r\nBOTH.\r\nName them, my lord, let’s know them.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nYou that way, and you this, but two in company.\r\nEach man apart, all single and alone,\r\nYet an arch-villain keeps him company.\r\n[_To one_.] If where thou art, two villians shall not be,\r\nCome not near him. [_To the other_.] If thou wouldst not reside\r\nBut where one villain is, then him abandon.\r\nHence, pack! There’s gold. You came for gold, ye slaves.\r\n[_To one_.] You have work for me, there’s payment, hence!\r\n[_To the other_.] You are an alchemist; make gold of that.\r\nOut, rascal dogs!\r\n\r\n[_Timon drives them out and then retires to his cave_]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. The same\r\n\r\nEnter Flavius and two Senators.\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS.\r\nIt is vain that you would speak with Timon.\r\nFor he is set so only to himself\r\nThat nothing but himself which looks like man\r\nIs friendly with him.\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nBring us to his cave.\r\nIt is our part and promise to th’ Athenians\r\nTo speak with Timon.\r\n\r\nSECOND SENATOR.\r\nAt all times alike\r\nMen are not still the same: ’twas time and griefs\r\nThat framed him thus. Time, with his fairer hand,\r\nOffering the fortunes of his former days,\r\nThe former man may make him. Bring us to him\r\nAnd chance it as it may.\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS.\r\nHere is his cave.\r\nPeace and content be here! Lord Timon! Timon,\r\nLook out and speak to friends. The Athenians\r\nBy two of their most reverend senate greet thee.\r\nSpeak to them, noble Timon.\r\n\r\nEnter Timon out of his cave.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nThou sun that comforts, burn! Speak and be hanged!\r\nFor each true word, a blister, and each false\r\nBe as a cantherizing to the root o’ th’ tongue,\r\nConsuming it with speaking.\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nWorthy Timon—\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nOf none but such as you, and you of Timon.\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nThe senators of Athens greet thee, Timon.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\n[_Aside_.] I thank them and would send them back the plague,\r\nCould I but catch it for them.\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nO, forget\r\nWhat we are sorry for ourselves in thee.\r\nThe senators with one consent of love\r\nEntreat thee back to Athens, who have thought\r\nOn special dignities, which vacant lie\r\nFor thy best use and wearing.\r\n\r\nSECOND SENATOR.\r\nThey confess\r\nToward thee forgetfulness too general gross,\r\nWhich now the public body, which doth seldom\r\nPlay the recanter, feeling in itself\r\nA lack of Timon’s aid, hath sense withal\r\nOf its own fall, restraining aid to Timon,\r\nAnd send forth us to make their sorrowed render,\r\nTogether with a recompense more fruitful\r\nThan their offence can weigh down by the dram,\r\nAy, even such heaps and sums of love and wealth,\r\nAs shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs,\r\nAnd write in thee the figures of their love,\r\nEver to read them thine.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nYou witch me in it,\r\nSurprise me to the very brink of tears.\r\nLend me a fool’s heart and a woman’s eyes\r\nAnd I’ll beweep these comforts, worthy senators.\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nTherefore so please thee to return with us,\r\nAnd of our Athens, thine and ours, to take\r\nThe captainship, thou shalt be met with thanks,\r\nAllowed with absolute power, and thy good name\r\nLive with authority. So soon we shall drive back\r\nOf Alcibiades th’ approaches wild,\r\nWho like a boar too savage doth root up\r\nHis country’s peace.\r\n\r\nSECOND SENATOR.\r\nAnd shakes his threatening sword\r\nAgainst the walls of Athens.\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nTherefore, Timon—\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nWell, sir, I will. Therefore I will, sir, thus:\r\nIf Alcibiades kill my countrymen,\r\nLet Alcibiades know this of Timon,\r\nThat Timon cares not. But if he sack fair Athens\r\nAnd take our goodly aged men by th’ beards,\r\nGiving our holy virgins to the stain\r\nOf contumelious, beastly, mad-brained war,\r\nThen let him know, and tell him Timon speaks it,\r\nIn pity of our aged and our youth,\r\nI cannot choose but tell him that I care not;\r\nAnd—let him take’t at worst—for their knives care not\r\nWhile you have throats to answer. For myself,\r\nThere’s not a whittle in th’ unruly camp\r\nBut I do prize it at my love before\r\nThe reverend’st throat in Athens. So I leave you\r\nTo the protection of the prosperous gods,\r\nAs thieves to keepers.\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS.\r\nStay not, all’s in vain.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nWhy, I was writing of my epitaph;\r\nIt will be seen tomorrow. My long sickness\r\nOf health and living now begins to mend\r\nAnd nothing brings me all things. Go, live still,\r\nBe Alcibiades your plague, you his,\r\nAnd last so long enough.\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nWe speak in vain.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nBut yet I love my country and am not\r\nOne that rejoices in the common wrack,\r\nAs common bruit doth put it.\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nThat’s well spoke.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nCommend me to my loving countrymen.\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nThese words become your lips as they pass through them.\r\n\r\nSECOND SENATOR.\r\nAnd enter in our ears like great triumphers\r\nIn their applauding gates.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nCommend me to them,\r\nAnd tell them that to ease them of their griefs,\r\nTheir fears of hostile strokes, their aches, losses,\r\nTheir pangs of love, with other incident throes\r\nThat nature’s fragile vessel doth sustain\r\nIn life’s uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do them;\r\nI’ll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades’ wrath.\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\n[_Aside_.] I like this well, he will return again.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nI have a tree which grows here in my close\r\nThat mine own use invites me to cut down,\r\nAnd shortly must I fell it. Tell my friends,\r\nTell Athens, in the sequence of degree\r\nFrom high to low throughout, that whoso please\r\nTo stop affliction, let him take his haste,\r\nCome hither ere my tree hath felt the axe\r\nAnd hang himself. I pray you do my greeting.\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS.\r\nTrouble him no further; thus you still shall find him.\r\n\r\nTIMON.\r\nCome not to me again, but say to Athens\r\nTimon hath made his everlasting mansion\r\nUpon the beached verge of the salt flood,\r\nWho once a day with his embossed froth\r\nThe turbulent surge shall cover; thither come,\r\nAnd let my gravestone be your oracle.\r\nLips, let sour words go by, and language end:\r\nWhat is amiss, plague and infection mend;\r\nGraves only be men’s works and death their gain,\r\nSun, hide thy beams, Timon hath done his reign.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Timon into his cave._]\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nHis discontents are unremovably\r\nCoupled to nature.\r\n\r\nSECOND SENATOR.\r\nOur hope in him is dead. Let us return\r\nAnd strain what other means is left unto us\r\nIn our dear peril.\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nIt requires swift foot.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. Before the walls of Athens\r\n\r\nEnter two other Senators, with a Messenger.\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nThou hast painfully discovered. Are his files\r\nAs full as thy report?\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nI have spoke the least.\r\nBesides, his expedition promises\r\nPresent approach.\r\n\r\nSECOND SENATOR.\r\nWe stand much hazard if they bring not Timon.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nI met a courier, one mine ancient friend,\r\nWhom, though in general part we were opposed,\r\nYet our old love made a particular force\r\nAnd made us speak like friends. This man was riding\r\nFrom Alcibiades to Timon’s cave\r\nWith letters of entreaty, which imported\r\nHis fellowship i’ th’ cause against your city,\r\nIn part for his sake moved.\r\n\r\nEnter the other Senators from Timon.\r\n\r\nTHIRD SENATOR.\r\nHere come our brothers.\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nNo talk of Timon, nothing of him expect.\r\nThe enemy’s drum is heard, and fearful scouring\r\nDoth choke the air with dust. In, and prepare.\r\nOurs is the fall, I fear, our foe’s the snare.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV. The woods. Timon’s cave, and a rude tomb seen\r\n\r\nEnter a Soldier in the woods, seeking Timon.\r\n\r\nSOLDIER.\r\nBy all description this should be the place.\r\nWho’s here? Speak, ho! No answer? What is this?\r\n_Timon is dead, who hath outstretched his span.\r\nSome beast read this; there does not live a man._\r\nDead, sure, and this his grave. What’s on this tomb\r\nI cannot read. The character I’ll take with wax.\r\nOur captain hath in every figure skill,\r\nAn aged interpreter, though young in days.\r\nBefore proud Athens he’s set down by this,\r\nWhose fall the mark of his ambition is.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE V. Before the walls of Athens\r\n\r\nTrumpets sound. Enter Alcibiades with his powers before Athens.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nSound to this coward and lascivious town\r\nOur terrible approach.\r\n\r\n[_A parley sounds._]\r\n\r\nThe Senators appear upon the walls.\r\n\r\nTill now you have gone on and filled the time\r\nWith all licentious measure, making your wills\r\nThe scope of justice. Till now myself and such\r\nAs slept within the shadow of your power\r\nHave wandered with our traversed arms, and breathed\r\nOur sufferance vainly. Now the time is flush,\r\nWhen crouching marrow, in the bearer strong\r\nCries of itself, “No more!” Now breathless wrong\r\nShall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease,\r\nAnd pursy insolence shall break his wind\r\nWith fear and horrid flight.\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nNoble and young,\r\nWhen thy first griefs were but a mere conceit,\r\nEre thou hadst power or we had cause of fear,\r\nWe sent to thee to give thy rages balm,\r\nTo wipe out our ingratitude with loves\r\nAbove their quantity.\r\n\r\nSECOND SENATOR.\r\nSo did we woo\r\nTransformed Timon to our city’s love\r\nBy humble message and by promised means.\r\nWe were not all unkind, nor all deserve\r\nThe common stroke of war.\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nThese walls of ours\r\nWere not erected by their hands from whom\r\nYou have received your griefs; nor are they such\r\nThat these great towers, trophies, and schools should fall\r\nFor private faults in them.\r\n\r\nSECOND SENATOR.\r\nNor are they living\r\nWho were the motives that you first went out.\r\nShame, that they wanted cunning, in excess\r\nHath broke their hearts. March, noble lord,\r\nInto our city with thy banners spread.\r\nBy decimation and a tithed death,\r\nIf thy revenges hunger for that food\r\nWhich nature loathes, take thou the destined tenth,\r\nAnd by the hazard of the spotted die\r\nLet die the spotted.\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nAll have not offended.\r\nFor those that were, it is not square to take,\r\nOn those that are, revenge. Crimes, like lands,\r\nAre not inherited. Then, dear countryman,\r\nBring in thy ranks but leave without thy rage;\r\nSpare thy Athenian cradle and those kin\r\nWhich in the bluster of thy wrath must fall\r\nWith those that have offended. Like a shepherd\r\nApproach the fold and cull th’ infected forth,\r\nBut kill not all together.\r\n\r\nSECOND SENATOR.\r\nWhat thou wilt,\r\nThou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile\r\nThan hew to ’t with thy sword.\r\n\r\nFIRST SENATOR.\r\nSet but thy foot\r\nAgainst our rampired gates and they shall ope,\r\nSo thou wilt send thy gentle heart before\r\nTo say thou’lt enter friendly.\r\n\r\nSECOND SENATOR.\r\nThrow thy glove,\r\nOr any token of thine honour else,\r\nThat thou wilt use the wars as thy redress\r\nAnd not as our confusion, all thy powers\r\nShall make their harbour in our town till we\r\nHave sealed thy full desire.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nThen there’s my glove;\r\nDescend and open your uncharged ports.\r\nThose enemies of Timon’s and mine own\r\nWhom you yourselves shall set out for reproof\r\nFall, and no more. And, to atone your fears\r\nWith my more noble meaning, not a man\r\nShall pass his quarter or offend the stream\r\nOf regular justice in your city’s bounds,\r\nBut shall be remedied to your public laws\r\nAt heaviest answer.\r\n\r\nBOTH.\r\n’Tis most nobly spoken.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\nDescend, and keep your words.\r\n\r\n[_The Senators descend._]\r\n\r\nEnter a Soldier.\r\n\r\nSOLDIER.\r\nMy noble general, Timon is dead,\r\nEntombed upon the very hem o’ th’ sea,\r\nAnd on his gravestone this insculpture, which\r\nWith wax I brought away, whose soft impression\r\nInterprets for my poor ignorance.\r\n\r\nALCIBIADES.\r\n[_Reads the Epitaph._] _Here lies a wretched corse, of wretched soul\r\nbereft.\r\nSeek not my name. A plague consume you, wicked caitiffs left!\r\nHere lie I, Timon, who alive all living men did hate.\r\nPass by and curse thy fill, but pass and stay not here thy gait._\r\nThese well express in thee thy latter spirits.\r\nThough thou abhorred’st in us our human griefs,\r\nScorned’st our brains’ flow and those our droplets which\r\nFrom niggard nature fall, yet rich conceit\r\nTaught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye\r\nOn thy low grave, on faults forgiven. Dead\r\nIs noble Timon, of whose memory\r\nHereafter more. Bring me into your city,\r\nAnd I will use the olive with my sword,\r\nMake war breed peace, make peace stint war, make each\r\nPrescribe to other, as each other’s leech.\r\nLet our drums strike.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\nTHE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS\r\n\nContents\r\n\r\n ACT I\r\n Scene I.

Alarbus’ limbs are lopped,\r\nAnd entrails feed the sacrificing fire,\r\nWhose smoke like incense doth perfume the sky.\r\nRemaineth naught but to inter our brethren,\r\nAnd with loud ’larums welcome them to Rome.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nLet it be so; and let Andronicus\r\nMake this his latest farewell to their souls.\r\n\r\n[_Sound trumpets, and lay the coffin in the tomb._]\r\n\r\nIn peace and honour rest you here, my sons;\r\nRome’s readiest champions, repose you here in rest,\r\nSecure from worldly chances and mishaps.\r\nHere lurks no treason, here no envy swells,\r\nHere grow no damned drugs; here are no storms,\r\nNo noise, but silence and eternal sleep.\r\nIn peace and honour rest you here, my sons.\r\n\r\nEnter Lavinia.\r\n\r\nLAVINIA.\r\nIn peace and honour live Lord Titus long;\r\nMy noble lord and father, live in fame.\r\nLo, at this tomb my tributary tears\r\nI render for my brethren’s obsequies;\r\nAnd at thy feet I kneel, with tears of joy\r\nShed on this earth for thy return to Rome.\r\nO, bless me here with thy victorious hand,\r\nWhose fortunes Rome’s best citizens applaud.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nKind Rome, that hast thus lovingly reserved\r\nThe cordial of mine age to glad my heart!\r\nLavinia, live;

Let me see it then.\r\n\r\nMARCUS.\r\nThis was thy daughter.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nWhy, Marcus, so she is.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nAy me, this object kills me!\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nFaint-hearted boy, arise, and look upon her.\r\nSpeak, Lavinia, what accursed hand\r\nHath made thee handless in thy father’s sight?\r\nWhat fool hath added water to the sea,\r\nOr brought a faggot to bright-burning Troy?\r\nMy grief was at the height before thou cam’st,\r\nAnd now like Nilus it disdaineth bounds.\r\nGive me a sword, I’ll chop off my hands too;\r\nFor they have fought for Rome, and all in vain;\r\nAnd they have nursed this woe in feeding life;\r\nIn bootless prayer have they been held up,\r\nAnd they have served me to effectless use.\r\nNow all the service I require of them\r\nIs that the one will help to cut the other.\r\n’Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands,\r\nFor hands to do Rome service is but vain.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nSpeak, gentle sister, who hath martyred thee?\r\n\r\nMARCUS.\r\nO, that delightful engine of her thoughts,\r\nThat blabbed them with such pleasing eloquence,\r\nIs torn from forth that pretty hollow cage,\r\nWhere, like a sweet melodious bird, it sung\r\nSweet varied notes, enchanting every ear.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nO, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?\r\n\r\nMARCUS.\r\nO, thus I found her straying in the park,\r\nSeeking to hide herself, as doth the deer\r\nThat hath received some unrecuring wound.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nIt was my dear, and he that wounded her\r\nHath hurt me more than had he killed me dead.\r\nFor now I stand as one upon a rock,\r\nEnvironed with a wilderness of sea,\r\nWho marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave,\r\nExpecting ever when some envious surge\r\nWill in his brinish bowels swallow him.\r\nThis way to death my wretched sons are gone;\r\nHere stands my other son, a banished man,\r\nAnd here my brother, weeping at my woes.\r\nBut that which gives my soul the greatest spurn\r\nIs dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul.\r\nHad I but seen thy picture in this plight\r\nIt would have madded me. What shall I do\r\nNow I behold thy lively body so?\r\nThou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears,\r\nNor tongue to tell me who hath martyred thee.\r\nThy husband he is dead, and for his death\r\nThy brothers are condemned, and dead by this.\r\nLook, Marcus! Ah, son Lucius, look on her!\r\nWhen I did name her brothers, then fresh tears\r\nStood on her cheeks, as doth the honey-dew\r\nUpon a gathered lily almost withered.\r\n\r\nMARCUS.\r\nPerchance she weeps because they killed her husband;\r\nPerchance because she knows them innocent.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nIf they did kill thy husband, then be joyful,\r\nBecause the law hath ta’en revenge on them.\r\nNo, no, they would not do so foul a deed;\r\nWitness the sorrow that their sister makes.\r\nGentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips,\r\nOr make some sign how I may do thee ease.\r\nShall thy good uncle, and thy brother Lucius,\r\nAnd thou, and I, sit round about some fountain,\r\nLooking all downwards to behold our cheeks\r\nHow they are stained, like meadows yet not dry,\r\nWith miry slime left on them by a flood?\r\nAnd in the fountain shall we gaze so long\r\nTill the fresh taste be taken from that clearness,\r\nAnd made a brine-pit with our bitter tears?\r\nOr shall we cut away our hands like thine?\r\nOr shall we bite our tongues, and in dumb shows\r\nPass the remainder of our hateful days?\r\nWhat shall we do? Let us that have our tongues\r\nPlot some device of further misery,\r\nTo make us wondered at in time to come.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nSweet father, cease your tears; for at your grief\r\nSee how my wretched sister sobs and weeps.\r\n\r\nMARCUS.\r\nPatience, dear niece. Good Titus, dry thine eyes.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nAh, Marcus, Marcus! Brother, well I wot\r\nThy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine,\r\nFor thou, poor man, hast drowned it with thine own.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nAh, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nMark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs.\r\nHad she a tongue to speak, now would she say\r\nThat to her brother which I said to thee.\r\nHis napkin, with his true tears all bewet,\r\nCan do no service on her sorrowful cheeks.\r\nO, what a sympathy of woe is this,\r\nAs far from help as limbo is from bliss.\r\n\r\nEnter Aaron the Moor, alone.\r\n\r\nAARON.\r\nTitus Andronicus, my lord the emperor\r\nSends thee this word, that, if thou love thy sons,\r\nLet Marcus, Lucius, or thyself, old Titus,\r\nOr any one of you, chop off your hand\r\nAnd send it to the king; he for the same\r\nWill send thee hither both thy sons alive,\r\nAnd that shall be the ransom for their fault.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nO gracious emperor! O gentle Aaron!\r\nDid ever raven sing so like a lark\r\nThat gives sweet tidings of the sun’s uprise?\r\nWith all my heart I’ll send the emperor my hand.\r\nGood Aaron, wilt thou help to chop it off?\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nStay, father, for that noble hand of thine,\r\nThat hath thrown down so many enemies,\r\nShall not be sent. My hand will serve the turn.\r\nMy youth can better spare my blood than you;\r\nAnd therefore mine shall save my brothers’ lives.\r\n\r\nMARCUS.\r\nWhich of your hands hath not defended Rome,\r\nAnd reared aloft the bloody battle-axe,\r\nWriting destruction on the enemy’s castle?\r\nO, none of both but are of high desert.\r\nMy hand hath been but idle; let it serve\r\nTo ransom my two nephews from their death;\r\nThen have I kept it to a worthy end.\r\n\r\nAARON.\r\nNay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,\r\nFor fear they die before their pardon come.\r\n\r\nMARCUS.\r\nMy hand shall go.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nBy heaven, it shall not go!\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nSirs, strive no more. Such withered herbs as these\r\nAre meet for plucking up, and therefore mine.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nSweet father, if I shall be thought thy son,\r\nLet me redeem my brothers both from death.\r\n\r\nMARCUS.\r\nAnd for our father’s sake and mother’s care,\r\nNow let me show a brother’s love to thee.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nAgree between you; I will spare my hand.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nThen I’ll go fetch an axe.\r\n\r\nMARCUS.\r\nBut I will use the axe.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Lucius and Marcus._]\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nCome hither, Aaron; I’ll deceive them both.\r\nLend me thy hand, and I will give thee mine.\r\n\r\nAARON.\r\n[_Aside_.] If that be called deceit, I will be honest,\r\nAnd never whilst I live deceive men so.\r\nBut I’ll deceive you in another sort,\r\nAnd that you’ll say ere half an hour pass.\r\n\r\n[_He cuts off Titus’s hand._]\r\n\r\nEnter Lucius and Marcus again.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nNow stay your strife. What shall be is dispatched.\r\nGood Aaron, give his majesty my hand.\r\nTell him it was a hand that warded him\r\nFrom thousand dangers, bid him bury it;\r\nMore hath it merited, that let it have.\r\nAs for my sons, say I account of them\r\nAs jewels purchased at an easy price;\r\nAnd yet dear too, because I bought mine own.\r\n\r\nAARON.\r\nI go, Andronicus; and for thy hand\r\nLook by and by to have thy sons with thee.\r\n[_Aside_.] Their heads, I mean. O, how this villainy\r\nDoth fat me with the very thoughts of it!\r\nLet fools do good, and fair men call for grace,\r\nAaron will have his soul black like his face.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nO, here I lift this one hand up to heaven,\r\nAnd bow this feeble ruin to the earth.\r\nIf any power pities wretched tears,\r\nTo that I call! [_To Lavinia_.] What, wouldst thou kneel with me?\r\nDo, then, dear heart; for heaven shall hear our prayers,\r\nOr with our sighs we’ll breathe the welkin dim,\r\nAnd stain the sun with fog, as sometime clouds\r\nWhen they do hug him in their melting bosoms.\r\n\r\nMARCUS.\r\nO brother, speak with possibility,\r\nAnd do not break into these deep extremes.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nIs not my sorrow deep, having no bottom?\r\nThen be my passions bottomless with them.\r\n\r\nMARCUS.\r\nBut yet let reason govern thy lament.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nIf there were reason for these miseries,\r\nThen into limits could I bind my woes.\r\nWhen heaven doth weep, doth not the earth o’erflow?\r\nIf the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad,\r\nThreatening the welkin with his big-swol’n face?\r\nAnd wilt thou have a reason for this coil?\r\nI am the sea. Hark how her sighs doth flow!\r\nShe is the weeping welkin, I the earth.\r\nThen must my sea be moved with her sighs;\r\nThen must my earth with her continual tears\r\nBecome a deluge, overflowed and drowned;\r\nFor why my bowels cannot hide her woes,\r\nBut like a drunkard must I vomit them.\r\nThen give me leave, for losers will have leave\r\nTo ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues.\r\n\r\nEnter a Messenger with two heads and a hand.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nWorthy Andronicus, ill art thou repaid\r\nFor that good hand thou sent’st the emperor.\r\nHere are the heads of thy two noble sons,\r\nAnd here’s thy hand, in scorn to thee sent back.\r\nThy grief their sports, thy resolution mocked;\r\nThat woe is me to think upon thy woes,\r\nMore than remembrance of my father’s death.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nMARCUS.\r\nNow let hot Etna cool in Sicily,\r\nAnd be my heart an ever-burning hell!\r\nThese miseries are more than may be borne.\r\nTo weep with them that weep doth ease some deal,\r\nBut sorrow flouted at is double death.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nAh, that this sight should make so deep a wound,\r\nAnd yet detested life not shrink thereat!\r\nThat ever death should let life bear his name,\r\nWhere life hath no more interest but to breathe!\r\n\r\n[_Lavinia kisses Titus._]\r\n\r\nMARCUS.\r\nAlas, poor heart, that kiss is comfortless\r\nAs frozen water to a starved snake.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nWhen will this fearful slumber have an end?\r\n\r\nMARCUS.\r\nNow farewell, flattery; die, Andronicus;\r\nThou dost not slumber. See thy two sons’ heads,\r\nThy warlike hand, thy mangled daughter here;\r\nThy other banished son with this dear sight\r\nStruck pale and bloodless; and thy brother, I,\r\nEven like a stony image, cold and numb.\r\nAh, now no more will I control thy griefs.\r\nRent off thy silver hair, thy other hand\r\nGnawing with thy teeth; and be this dismal sight\r\nThe closing up of our most wretched eyes.\r\nNow is a time to storm; why art thou still?\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nHa, ha, ha!\r\n\r\nMARCUS.\r\nWhy dost thou laugh? It fits not with this hour.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nWhy, I have not another tear to shed.\r\nBesides, this sorrow is an enemy,\r\nAnd would usurp upon my watery eyes,\r\nAnd make them blind with tributary tears.\r\nThen which way shall I find Revenge’s cave?\r\nFor these two heads do seem to speak to me,\r\nAnd threat me I shall never come to bliss\r\nTill all these mischiefs be returned again\r\nEven in their throats that have committed them.\r\nCome, let me see what task I have to do.\r\nYou heavy people, circle me about,\r\nThat I may turn me to each one of you,\r\nAnd swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.\r\nThe vow is made.

This poor right hand of mine\r\nIs left to tyrannize upon my breast;\r\nWho when my heart, all mad with misery,\r\nBeats in this hollow prison of my flesh,\r\nThen thus I thump it down.\r\nThou map of woe, that thus dost talk in signs,\r\nWhen thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating,\r\nThou canst not strike it thus to make it still.\r\nWound it with sighing, girl, kill it with groans;\r\nOr get some little knife between thy teeth,\r\nAnd just against thy heart make thou a hole,\r\nThat all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall\r\nMay run into that sink, and, soaking in,\r\nDrown the lamenting fool in sea-salt tears.\r\n\r\nMARCUS.\r\nFie, brother, fie! Teach her not thus to lay\r\nSuch violent hands upon her tender life.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nHow now! Has sorrow made thee dote already?\r\nWhy, Marcus, no man should be mad but I.\r\nWhat violent hands can she lay on her life?\r\nAh, wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands,\r\nTo bid Æneas tell the tale twice o’er\r\nHow Troy was burnt and he made miserable?\r\nO, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,\r\nLest we remember still that we have none.\r\nFie, fie, how frantically I square my talk,\r\nAs if we should forget we had no hands,\r\nIf Marcus did not name the word of hands!\r\nCome, let’s fall to; and, gentle girl, eat this.\r\nHere is no drink! Hark, Marcus, what she says;\r\nI can interpret all her martyred signs.\r\nShe says she drinks no other drink but tears,\r\nBrewed with her sorrow, meshed upon her cheeks.\r\nSpeechless complainer, I will learn thy thought;\r\nIn thy dumb action will I be as perfect\r\nAs begging hermits in their holy prayers.\r\nThou shalt not sigh, nor hold thy stumps to heaven,\r\nNor wink, nor nod, nor kneel, nor make a sign,\r\nBut I of these will wrest an alphabet,\r\nAnd by still practice learn to know thy meaning.\r\n\r\nYOUNG LUCIUS.\r\nGood grandsire, leave these bitter deep laments.\r\nMake my aunt merry with some pleasing tale.\r\n\r\nMARCUS.\r\nAlas, the tender boy, in passion moved,\r\nDoth weep to see his grandsire’s heaviness.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nPeace, tender sapling; thou art made of tears,\r\nAnd tears will quickly melt thy life away.\r\n\r\n[_Marcus strikes the dish with a knife._]\r\n\r\nWhat dost thou strike at, Marcus, with thy knife?\r\n\r\nMARCUS.\r\nAt that that I have killed, my lord, a fly.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nOut on thee, murderer! Thou kill’st my heart;\r\nMine eyes are cloyed with view of tyranny;\r\nA deed of death done on the innocent\r\nBecomes not Titus’ brother.

How if that fly had a father and mother?\r\nHow would he hang his slender gilded wings\r\nAnd buzz lamenting doings in the air!\r\nPoor harmless fly,\r\nThat with his pretty buzzing melody,\r\nCame here to make us merry, and thou hast killed him.\r\n\r\nMARCUS.\r\nPardon me, sir; ’twas a black ill-favoured fly,\r\nLike to the empress’ Moor; therefore I killed him.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nO, O, O!\r\nThen pardon me for reprehending thee,\r\nFor thou hast done a charitable deed.\r\nGive me thy knife, I will insult on him,\r\nFlattering myself as if it were the Moor\r\nCome hither purposely to poison me.\r\nThere’s for thyself, and that’s for Tamora.\r\nAh, sirrah!\r\nYet, I think, we are not brought so low\r\nBut that between us we can kill a fly\r\nThat comes in likeness of a coal-black Moor.\r\n\r\nMARCUS.\r\nAlas, poor man, grief has so wrought on him,\r\nHe takes false shadows for true substances.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nCome, take away. Lavinia, go with me.\r\nI’ll to thy closet, and go read with thee\r\nSad stories chanced in the times of old.\r\nCome, boy, and go with me.

Do not fear thine aunt.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nShe loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.\r\n\r\nYOUNG LUCIUS\r\nAy, when my father was in Rome she did.\r\n\r\nMARCUS.\r\nWhat means my niece Lavinia by these signs?\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nFear her not, Lucius. Somewhat doth she mean.\r\nSee, Lucius, see how much she makes of thee.\r\nSomewhither would she have thee go with her.\r\nAh, boy, Cornelia never with more care\r\nRead to her sons than she hath read to thee\r\nSweet poetry and Tully’s _Orator_.\r\n\r\nMARCUS.\r\nCanst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus?\r\n\r\nYOUNG LUCIUS.\r\nMy lord, I know not, I, nor can I guess,\r\nUnless some fit or frenzy do possess her;\r\nFor I have heard my grandsire say full oft,\r\nExtremity of griefs would make men mad;\r\nAnd I have read that Hecuba of Troy\r\nRan mad for sorrow. That made me to fear,\r\nAlthough, my lord, I know my noble aunt\r\nLoves me as dear as e’er my mother did,\r\nAnd would not, but in fury, fright my youth;\r\nWhich made me down to throw my books, and fly,\r\nCauseless, perhaps. But pardon me, sweet aunt.\r\nAnd, madam, if my uncle Marcus go,\r\nI will most willingly attend your ladyship.\r\n\r\nMARCUS.\r\nLucius, I will.\r\n\r\n[_Lavinia turns over with her stumps the books which Lucius has let\r\nfall._]\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nHow now, Lavinia? Marcus, what means this?\r\nSome book there is that she desires to see.\r\nWhich is it, girl, of these? Open them, boy.\r\nBut thou art deeper read and better skilled.\r\nCome and take choice of all my library,\r\nAnd so beguile thy sorrow, till the heavens\r\nReveal the damned contriver of this deed.\r\nWhy lifts she up her arms in sequence thus?\r\n\r\nMARCUS.\r\nI think she means that there were more than one\r\nConfederate in the fact. Ay, more there was,\r\nOr else to heaven she heaves them for revenge.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nLucius, what book is that she tosseth so?\r\n\r\nYOUNG LUCIUS.\r\nGrandsire, ’tis Ovid’s _Metamorphosis_.\r\nMy mother gave it me.\r\n\r\nMARCUS.\r\nFor love of her that’s gone,\r\nPerhaps, she culled it from among the rest.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nSoft! So busily she turns the leaves!\r\nHelp her! What would she find? Lavinia, shall I read?\r\nThis is the tragic tale of Philomel,\r\nAnd treats of Tereus’ treason and his rape;\r\nAnd rape, I fear, was root of thy annoy.\r\n\r\nMARCUS.\r\nSee, brother, see! Note how she quotes the leaves.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nLavinia, wert thou thus surprised, sweet girl,\r\nRavished and wronged, as Philomela was,\r\nForced in the ruthless, vast, and gloomy woods?\r\nSee, see!\r\nAy, such a place there is where we did hunt,—\r\nO, had we never, never hunted there!—\r\nPatterned by that the poet here describes,\r\nBy nature made for murders and for rapes.\r\n\r\nMARCUS.\r\nO, why should nature build so foul a den,\r\nUnless the gods delight in tragedies?\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nGive signs, sweet girl, for here are none but friends,\r\nWhat Roman lord it was durst do the deed.\r\nOr slunk not Saturnine, as Tarquin erst,\r\nThat left the camp to sin in Lucrece’ bed?\r\n\r\nMARCUS.\r\nSit down, sweet niece.

Well, well, I made thee miserable\r\nWhat time I threw the people’s suffrages\r\nOn him that thus doth tyrannize o’er me.\r\nGo, get you gone; and pray be careful all,\r\nAnd leave you not a man-of-war unsearched.\r\nThis wicked emperor may have shipped her hence;\r\nAnd, kinsmen, then we may go pipe for justice.\r\n\r\nMARCUS.\r\nO Publius, is not this a heavy case,\r\nTo see thy noble uncle thus distract?\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\nTherefore, my lords, it highly us concerns\r\nBy day and night to attend him carefully,\r\nAnd feed his humour kindly as we may,\r\nTill time beget some careful remedy.\r\n\r\nMARCUS.\r\nKinsmen, his sorrows are past remedy,\r\nBut . . . .\r\nJoin with the Goths, and with revengeful war\r\nTake wreak on Rome for this ingratitude,\r\nAnd vengeance on the traitor Saturnine.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nPublius, how now? How now, my masters?\r\nWhat, have you met with her?\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\nNo, my good lord; but Pluto sends you word,\r\nIf you will have Revenge from hell, you shall.\r\nMarry, for Justice, she is so employed,\r\nHe thinks, with Jove in heaven, or somewhere else,\r\nSo that perforce you must needs stay a time.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nHe doth me wrong to feed me with delays.\r\nI’ll dive into the burning lake below,\r\nAnd pull her out of Acheron by the heels.\r\nMarcus, we are but shrubs, no cedars we,\r\nNo big-boned men framed of the Cyclops’ size;\r\nBut metal, Marcus, steel to the very back,\r\nYet wrung with wrongs more than our backs can bear;\r\nAnd sith there’s no justice in earth nor hell,\r\nWe will solicit heaven and move the gods\r\nTo send down Justice for to wreak our wrongs.\r\nCome, to this gear.

Publius, Publius, what hast thou done?\r\nSee, see, thou hast shot off one of Taurus’ horns.\r\n\r\nMARCUS.\r\nThis was the sport, my lord; when Publius shot,\r\nThe Bull, being galled, gave Aries such a knock\r\nThat down fell both the Ram’s horns in the court;\r\nAnd who should find them but the empress’ villain?\r\nShe laughed, and told the Moor he should not choose\r\nBut give them to his master for a present.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nWhy, there it goes. God give his lordship joy!\r\n\r\nEnter the Clown with a basket and two pigeons in it.\r\n\r\nNews, news from heaven! Marcus, the post is come.\r\nSirrah, what tidings?

Alas, sir, I never came there. God forbid I should be so\r\nbold to press to heaven in my young days. Why, I am going with my\r\npigeons to the tribunal plebs, to take up a matter of brawl betwixt my\r\nuncle and one of the emperal’s men.\r\n\r\nMARCUS.\r\nWhy, sir, that is as fit as can be to serve for your oration; and let\r\nhim deliver the pigeons to the emperor from you.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nTell me, can you deliver an oration to the emperor with a grace?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNay, truly, sir, I could never say grace in all my life.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nSirrah, come hither. Make no more ado,\r\nBut give your pigeons to the emperor.\r\nBy me thou shalt have justice at his hands.\r\nHold, hold; meanwhile here’s money for thy charges.\r\nGive me pen and ink.\r\nSirrah, can you with a grace deliver up a supplication?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nAy, sir.\r\n\r\nTITUS.\r\nThen here is a supplication for you.

Was ever seen\r\nAn emperor in Rome thus overborne,\r\nTroubled, confronted thus; and, for the extent\r\nOf legal justice, used in such contempt?\r\nMy lords, you know, as know the mightful gods,\r\nHowever these disturbers of our peace\r\nBuzz in the people’s ears, there naught hath passed\r\nBut even with law against the wilful sons\r\nOf old Andronicus. And what an if\r\nHis sorrows have so overwhelmed his wits?\r\nShall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks,\r\nHis fits, his frenzy, and his bitterness?\r\nAnd now he writes to heaven for his redress!\r\nSee, here’s “to Jove,” and this “to Mercury,”\r\nThis “to Apollo,” this to the god of war.\r\nSweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome!\r\nWhat’s this but libelling against the senate,\r\nAnd blazoning our injustice everywhere?\r\nA goodly humour, is it not, my lords?\r\nAs who would say, in Rome no justice were.\r\nBut if I live, his feigned ecstasies\r\nShall be no shelter to these outrages;\r\nBut he and his shall know that justice lives\r\nIn Saturninus’ health; whom, if she sleep,\r\nHe’ll so awake as he in fury shall\r\nCut off the proud’st conspirator that lives.\r\n\r\nTAMORA.\r\nMy gracious lord, my lovely Saturnine,\r\nLord of my life, commander of my thoughts,\r\nCalm thee, and bear the faults of Titus’ age,\r\nTh’ effects of sorrow for his valiant sons,\r\nWhose loss hath pierced him deep and scarred his heart;\r\nAnd rather comfort his distressed plight\r\nThan prosecute the meanest or the best\r\nFor these contempts. [_Aside_.] Why, thus it shall become\r\nHigh-witted Tamora to gloze with all.\r\nBut, Titus, I have touched thee to the quick;\r\nThy life-blood out, if Aaron now be wise,\r\nThen is all safe, the anchor in the port.\r\n\r\nEnter Clown.\r\n\r\nHow now, good fellow, wouldst thou speak with us?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nYes, forsooth, an your mistresship be emperial.\r\n\r\nTAMORA.\r\nEmpress I am, but yonder sits the emperor.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\n’Tis he.

Rome never had more cause.\r\nThe Goths have gathered head, and with a power\r\nOf high-resolved men, bent to the spoil,\r\nThey hither march amain, under conduct\r\nOf Lucius, son to old Andronicus;\r\nWho threats, in course of this revenge, to do\r\nAs much as ever Coriolanus did.\r\n\r\nSATURNINUS.\r\nIs warlike Lucius general of the Goths?\r\nThese tidings nip me, and I hang the head\r\nAs flowers with frost, or grass beat down with storms.\r\nAy, now begins our sorrows to approach.\r\n’Tis he the common people love so much;\r\nMyself hath often overheard them say,\r\nWhen I have walked like a private man,\r\nThat Lucius’ banishment was wrongfully,\r\nAnd they have wished that Lucius were their emperor.\r\n\r\nTAMORA.\r\nWhy should you fear?

From isles of Greece\r\nThe princes orgulous, their high blood chaf’d,\r\nHave to the port of Athens sent their ships\r\nFraught with the ministers and instruments\r\nOf cruel war. Sixty and nine that wore\r\nTheir crownets regal from the Athenian bay\r\nPut forth toward Phrygia; and their vow is made\r\nTo ransack Troy, within whose strong immures\r\nThe ravish’d Helen, Menelaus’ queen,\r\nWith wanton Paris sleeps—and that’s the quarrel.\r\nTo Tenedos they come,\r\nAnd the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge\r\nTheir war-like fraughtage. Now on Dardan plains\r\nThe fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch\r\nTheir brave pavilions: Priam’s six-gated city,\r\nDardan, and Tymbria, Ilias, Chetas, Troien,\r\nAnd Antenorides, with massy staples\r\nAnd corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,\r\nStir up the sons of Troy.\r\nNow expectation, tickling skittish spirits\r\nOn one and other side, Trojan and Greek,\r\nSets all on hazard. And hither am I come\r\nA prologue arm’d, but not in confidence\r\nOf author’s pen or actor’s voice, but suited\r\nIn like conditions as our argument,\r\nTo tell you, fair beholders, that our play\r\nLeaps o’er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils,\r\nBeginning in the middle; starting thence away,\r\nTo what may be digested in a play.\r\nLike or find fault; do as your pleasures are;\r\nNow good or bad, ’tis but the chance of war.\r\n\nACT I\r\n\r\nSCENE I. Troy. Before Priam’s palace.\r\n\n Enter Troilus armed, and Pandarus.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nCall here my varlet; I’ll unarm again.\r\nWhy should I war without the walls of Troy\r\nThat find such cruel battle here within?\r\nEach Trojan that is master of his heart,\r\nLet him to field; Troilus, alas! hath none.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nWill this gear ne’er be mended?\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nThe Greeks are strong, and skilful to their strength,\r\nFierce to their skill, and to their fierceness valiant;\r\nBut I am weaker than a woman’s tear,\r\nTamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,\r\nLess valiant than the virgin in the night,\r\nAnd skilless as unpractis’d infancy.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nWell, I have told you enough of this; for my part, I’ll not meddle nor\r\nmake no farther. He that will have a cake out of the wheat must tarry\r\nthe grinding.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nHave I not tarried?\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nAy, the grinding; but you must tarry the bolting.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nHave I not tarried?\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nAy, the bolting; but you must tarry the leavening.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nStill have I tarried.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nAy, to the leavening; but here’s yet in the word ‘hereafter’ the\r\nkneading, the making of the cake, the heating of the oven, and the\r\nbaking; nay, you must stay the cooling too, or you may chance burn your\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nPatience herself, what goddess e’er she be,\r\nDoth lesser blench at suff’rance than I do.\r\nAt Priam’s royal table do I sit;\r\nAnd when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts,\r\nSo, traitor! ‘when she comes’! when she is thence?\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nWell, she look’d yesternight fairer than ever I saw her look, or any\r\nwoman else.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nI was about to tell thee: when my heart,\r\nAs wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,\r\nLest Hector or my father should perceive me,\r\nI have, as when the sun doth light a storm,\r\nBuried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile.\r\nBut sorrow that is couch’d in seeming gladness\r\nIs like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nAn her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen’s, well, go to, there\r\nwere no more comparison between the women. But, for my part, she is my\r\nkinswoman; I would not, as they term it, praise her, but I would\r\nsomebody had heard her talk yesterday, as I did. I will not dispraise\r\nyour sister Cassandra’s wit; but—\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nO Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus,\r\nWhen I do tell thee there my hopes lie drown’d,\r\nReply not in how many fathoms deep\r\nThey lie indrench’d. I tell thee I am mad\r\nIn Cressid’s love. Thou answer’st ‘She is fair’;\r\nPour’st in the open ulcer of my heart\r\nHer eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,\r\nHandlest in thy discourse. O! that her hand,\r\nIn whose comparison all whites are ink\r\nWriting their own reproach; to whose soft seizure\r\nThe cygnet’s down is harsh, and spirit of sense\r\nHard as the palm of ploughman! This thou tell’st me,\r\nAs true thou tell’st me, when I say I love her;\r\nBut, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,\r\nThou lay’st in every gash that love hath given me\r\nThe knife that made it.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nI speak no more than truth.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nThou dost not speak so much.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nFaith, I’ll not meddle in’t. Let her be as she is: if she be fair, ’tis\r\nthe better for her; and she be not, she has the mends in her own hands.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nGood Pandarus! How now, Pandarus!\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nI have had my labour for my travail, ill thought on of her and ill\r\nthought on of you; gone between and between, but small thanks for my\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nWhat! art thou angry, Pandarus? What! with me?\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nBecause she’s kin to me, therefore she’s not so fair as Helen. And she\r\nwere not kin to me, she would be as fair on Friday as Helen is on\r\nSunday. But what care I? I care not and she were a blackamoor; ’tis all\r\none to me.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nSay I she is not fair?\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nI do not care whether you do or no. She’s a fool to stay behind her\r\nfather. Let her to the Greeks; and so I’ll tell her the next time I see\r\nher. For my part, I’ll meddle nor make no more i’ the matter.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nPandarus—\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nNot I.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nSweet Pandarus—\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nPray you, speak no more to me: I will leave all as I found it, and\r\nthere an end.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Pandarus. An alarum._]\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nPeace, you ungracious clamours! Peace, rude sounds!\r\nFools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair,\r\nWhen with your blood you daily paint her thus.\r\nI cannot fight upon this argument;\r\nIt is too starv’d a subject for my sword.\r\nBut Pandarus, O gods! how do you plague me!\r\nI cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar;\r\nAnd he’s as tetchy to be woo’d to woo\r\nAs she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.\r\nTell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne’s love,\r\nWhat Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we?\r\nHer bed is India; there she lies, a pearl;\r\nBetween our Ilium and where she resides\r\nLet it be call’d the wild and wandering flood;\r\nOurself the merchant, and this sailing Pandar\r\nOur doubtful hope, our convoy, and our bark.\r\n\r\n Alarum. Enter Aeneas.\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nHow now, Prince Troilus! Wherefore not afield?\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nBecause not there. This woman’s answer sorts,\r\nFor womanish it is to be from thence.\r\nWhat news, Aeneas, from the field today?\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nThat Paris is returned home, and hurt.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nBy whom, Aeneas?\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nTroilus, by Menelaus.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nLet Paris bleed: ’tis but a scar to scorn;\r\nParis is gor’d with Menelaus’ horn.\r\n\r\n [_Alarum._]\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nHark what good sport is out of town today!\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nBetter at home, if ‘would I might’ were ‘may.’\r\nBut to the sport abroad. Are you bound thither?\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nIn all swift haste.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nCome, go we then together.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. Troy. A street.\r\n\r\n Enter Cressida and her man Alexander.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nWho were those went by?\r\n\r\nALEXANDER.\r\nQueen Hecuba and Helen.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nAnd whither go they?\r\n\r\nALEXANDER.\r\nUp to the eastern tower,\r\nWhose height commands as subject all the vale,\r\nTo see the battle. Hector, whose patience\r\nIs as a virtue fix’d, today was mov’d.\r\nHe chid Andromache, and struck his armourer;\r\nAnd, like as there were husbandry in war,\r\nBefore the sun rose he was harness’d light,\r\nAnd to the field goes he; where every flower\r\nDid as a prophet weep what it foresaw\r\nIn Hector’s wrath.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nWhat was his cause of anger?\r\n\r\nALEXANDER.\r\nThe noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks\r\nA lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector;\r\nThey call him Ajax.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nGood; and what of him?\r\n\r\nALEXANDER.\r\nThey say he is a very man _per se_\r\nAnd stands alone.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nSo do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no legs.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER.\r\nThis man, lady, hath robb’d many beasts of their particular additions:\r\nhe is as valiant as the lion, churlish as the bear, slow as the\r\nelephant—a man into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his valour\r\nis crush’d into folly, his folly sauced with discretion. There is no\r\nman hath a virtue that he hath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint\r\nbut he carries some stain of it; he is melancholy without cause and\r\nmerry against the hair; he hath the joints of everything; but\r\neverything so out of joint that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and\r\nno use, or purblind Argus, all eyes and no sight.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nBut how should this man, that makes me smile, make Hector angry?\r\n\r\nALEXANDER.\r\nThey say he yesterday cop’d Hector in the battle and struck him down,\r\nthe disdain and shame whereof hath ever since kept Hector fasting and\r\nwaking.\r\n\r\n Enter Pandarus.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nWho comes here?\r\n\r\nALEXANDER.\r\nMadam, your uncle Pandarus.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nHector’s a gallant man.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER.\r\nAs may be in the world, lady.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nWhat’s that? What’s that?\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nGood morrow, uncle Pandarus.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nGood morrow, cousin Cressid. What do you talk of?—Good morrow,\r\nAlexander.—How do you, cousin? When were you at Ilium?\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nThis morning, uncle.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nWhat were you talking of when I came? Was Hector arm’d and gone ere you\r\ncame to Ilium? Helen was not up, was she?\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nHector was gone; but Helen was not up.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nE’en so. Hector was stirring early.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nThat were we talking of, and of his anger.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nWas he angry?\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nSo he says here.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nTrue, he was so; I know the cause too; he’ll lay about him today, I can\r\ntell them that. And there’s Troilus will not come far behind him; let\r\nthem take heed of Troilus, I can tell them that too.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nWhat, is he angry too?\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nWho, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nO Jupiter! there’s no comparison.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nWhat, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know a man if you see him?\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nAy, if I ever saw him before and knew him.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nWell, I say Troilus is Troilus.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nThen you say as I say, for I am sure he is not Hector.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nNo, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\n’Tis just to each of them: he is himself.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nHimself! Alas, poor Troilus! I would he were!\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nSo he is.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nCondition I had gone barefoot to India.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nHe is not Hector.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nHimself! no, he’s not himself. Would a’ were himself! Well, the gods\r\nare above; time must friend or end. Well, Troilus, well! I would my\r\nheart were in her body! No, Hector is not a better man than Troilus.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nExcuse me.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nHe is elder.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nPardon me, pardon me.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nTh’other’s not come to’t; you shall tell me another tale when\r\nth’other’s come to’t. Hector shall not have his wit this year.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nHe shall not need it if he have his own.\r\n\r\nANDARUS.\r\nNor his qualities.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nNo matter.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nNor his beauty.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\n’Twould not become him: his own’s better.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nYou have no judgement, niece. Helen herself swore th’other day that\r\nTroilus, for a brown favour, for so ’tis, I must confess—not brown\r\nneither—\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nNo, but brown.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nFaith, to say truth, brown and not brown.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nTo say the truth, true and not true.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nShe prais’d his complexion above Paris.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nWhy, Paris hath colour enough.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nSo he has.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nThen Troilus should have too much. If she prais’d him above, his\r\ncomplexion is higher than his; he having colour enough, and the other\r\nhigher, is too flaming a praise for a good complexion. I had as lief\r\nHelen’s golden tongue had commended Troilus for a copper nose.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nI swear to you I think Helen loves him better than Paris.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nThen she’s a merry Greek indeed.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nNay, I am sure she does. She came to him th’other day into the\r\ncompass’d window—and you know he has not past three or four hairs on\r\nhis chin—\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nIndeed a tapster’s arithmetic may soon bring his particulars therein to\r\na total.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nWhy, he is very young, and yet will he within three pound lift as much\r\nas his brother Hector.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nIs he so young a man and so old a lifter?\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nBut to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came and puts me her\r\nwhite hand to his cloven chin—\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nJuno have mercy! How came it cloven?\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nWhy, you know, ’tis dimpled. I think his smiling becomes him better\r\nthan any man in all Phrygia.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nO, he smiles valiantly!\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nDoes he not?\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nO yes, an ’twere a cloud in autumn!\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nWhy, go to, then! But to prove to you that Helen loves Troilus—\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nTroilus will stand to the proof, if you’ll prove it so.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nTroilus! Why, he esteems her no more than I esteem an addle egg.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nIf you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle head, you would\r\neat chickens i’ th’ shell.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nI cannot choose but laugh to think how she tickled his chin. Indeed,\r\nshe has a marvell’s white hand, I must needs confess.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nWithout the rack.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nAnd she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nAlas, poor chin! Many a wart is richer.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nBut there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laugh’d that her eyes ran\r\no’er.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nWith millstones.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nAnd Cassandra laugh’d.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nBut there was a more temperate fire under the pot of her eyes. Did her\r\neyes run o’er too?\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nAnd Hector laugh’d.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nAt what was all this laughing?\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nMarry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus’ chin.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nAnd’t had been a green hair I should have laugh’d too.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nThey laugh’d not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nWhat was his answer?\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nQuoth she ‘Here’s but two and fifty hairs on your chin, and one of them\r\nis white.’\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nThis is her question.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nThat’s true; make no question of that. ‘Two and fifty hairs,’ quoth he\r\n‘and one white. That white hair is my father, and all the rest are his\r\nsons.’ ‘Jupiter!’ quoth she ‘which of these hairs is Paris my husband?’\r\n‘The forked one,’ quoth he, ’pluck’t out and give it him.’ But there\r\nwas such laughing! and Helen so blush’d, and Paris so chaf’d; and all\r\nthe rest so laugh’d that it pass’d.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nSo let it now; for it has been a great while going by.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nWell, cousin, I told you a thing yesterday; think on’t.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nSo I do.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nI’ll be sworn ’tis true; he will weep you, and ’twere a man born in\r\nApril.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nAnd I’ll spring up in his tears, an ’twere a nettle against May.\r\n\r\n [_Sound a retreat._]\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nHark! they are coming from the field. Shall we stand up here and see\r\nthem as they pass toward Ilium? Good niece, do, sweet niece Cressida.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nAt your pleasure.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nHere, here, here’s an excellent place; here we may see most bravely.\r\nI’ll tell you them all by their names as they pass by; but mark Troilus\r\nabove the rest.\r\n\r\n [Aeneas _passes_.]\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nSpeak not so loud.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nThat’s Aeneas. Is not that a brave man? He’s one of the flowers of\r\nTroy, I can tell you. But mark Troilus; you shall see anon.\r\n\r\n [Antenor _passes_.]\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nWho’s that?\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nThat’s Antenor. He has a shrewd wit, I can tell you; and he’s a man\r\ngood enough; he’s one o’ th’ soundest judgements in Troy, whosoever,\r\nand a proper man of person. When comes Troilus? I’ll show you Troilus\r\nanon. If he see me, you shall see him nod at me.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nWill he give you the nod?\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nYou shall see.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nIf he do, the rich shall have more.\r\n\r\n [Hector _passes_.]\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nThat’s Hector, that, that, look you, that; there’s a fellow! Go thy\r\nway, Hector! There’s a brave man, niece. O brave Hector! Look how he\r\nlooks. There’s a countenance! Is’t not a brave man?\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nO, a brave man!\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nIs a’ not? It does a man’s heart good. Look you what hacks are on his\r\nhelmet! Look you yonder, do you see? Look you there. There’s no\r\njesting; there’s laying on; take’t off who will, as they say. There be\r\nhacks.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nBe those with swords?\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nSwords! anything, he cares not; and the devil come to him, it’s all\r\none. By God’s lid, it does one’s heart good. Yonder comes Paris, yonder\r\ncomes Paris.\r\n\r\n [Paris _passes_.]\r\n\r\nLook ye yonder, niece; is’t not a gallant man too, is’t not? Why, this\r\nis brave now. Who said he came hurt home today? He’s not hurt. Why,\r\nthis will do Helen’s heart good now, ha! Would I could see Troilus now!\r\nYou shall see Troilus anon.\r\n\r\n [Helenus _passes_.]\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nWho’s that?\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nThat’s Helenus. I marvel where Troilus is. That’s\r\nHelenus. I think he went not forth today. That’s Helenus.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nCan Helenus fight, uncle?\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nHelenus! no. Yes, he’ll fight indifferent well. I marvel where Troilus\r\nis. Hark! do you not hear the people cry ‘Troilus’?—Helenus is a\r\npriest.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nWhat sneaking fellow comes yonder?\r\n\r\n [Troilus _passes_.]\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nWhere? yonder? That’s Deiphobus. ’Tis Troilus. There’s a man, niece.\r\nHem! Brave Troilus, the prince of chivalry!\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nPeace, for shame, peace!\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nMark him; note him. O brave Troilus! Look well upon him, niece; look\r\nyou how his sword is bloodied, and his helm more hack’d than Hector’s;\r\nand how he looks, and how he goes! O admirable youth! he never saw\r\nthree and twenty. Go thy way, Troilus, go thy way. Had I a sister were\r\na grace or a daughter a goddess, he should take his choice. O admirable\r\nman! Paris? Paris is dirt to him; and, I warrant, Helen, to change,\r\nwould give an eye to boot.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nHere comes more.\r\n\r\n [_Common soldiers pass_.]\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nAsses, fools, dolts! chaff and bran, chaff and bran! porridge after\r\nmeat! I could live and die in the eyes of Troilus. Ne’er look, ne’er\r\nlook; the eagles are gone. Crows and daws, crows and daws! I had rather\r\nbe such a man as Troilus than Agamemnon and all Greece.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nThere is amongst the Greeks Achilles, a better man than Troilus.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nAchilles? A drayman, a porter, a very camel!\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nWell, well.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nWell, well! Why, have you any discretion? Have you any eyes? Do you\r\nknow what a man is? Is not birth, beauty, good shape, discourse,\r\nmanhood, learning, gentleness, virtue, youth, liberality, and such\r\nlike, the spice and salt that season a man?\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nAy, a minc’d man; and then to be bak’d with no date in the pie, for\r\nthen the man’s date is out.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nYou are such a woman! A man knows not at what ward you lie.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nUpon my back, to defend my belly; upon my wit, to defend my wiles; upon\r\nmy secrecy, to defend mine honesty; my mask, to defend my beauty; and\r\nyou, to defend all these; and at all these wards I lie, at a thousand\r\nwatches.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nSay one of your watches.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nNay, I’ll watch you for that; and that’s one of the chiefest of them\r\ntoo. If I cannot ward what I would not have hit, I can watch you for\r\ntelling how I took the blow; unless it swell past hiding, and then it’s\r\npast watching.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nYou are such another!\r\n\r\n Enter Troilus' Boy.\r\n\r\nBOY.\r\nSir, my lord would instantly speak with you.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nWhere?\r\n\r\nBOY.\r\nAt your own house; there he unarms him.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nGood boy, tell him I come. [_Exit_ Boy.] I doubt he be hurt. Fare ye\r\nwell, good niece.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nAdieu, uncle.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nI will be with you, niece, by and by.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nTo bring, uncle.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nAy, a token from Troilus.\r\n\r\n [_Exit_ Pandarus.]\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nBy the same token, you are a bawd.\r\nWords, vows, gifts, tears, and love’s full sacrifice,\r\nHe offers in another’s enterprise;\r\nBut more in Troilus thousand-fold I see\r\nThan in the glass of Pandar’s praise may be,\r\nYet hold I off. Women are angels, wooing:\r\nThings won are done; joy’s soul lies in the doing.\r\nThat she belov’d knows naught that knows not this:\r\nMen prize the thing ungain’d more than it is.\r\nThat she was never yet that ever knew\r\nLove got so sweet as when desire did sue;\r\nTherefore this maxim out of love I teach:\r\n‘Achievement is command; ungain’d, beseech.’\r\nThen though my heart’s content firm love doth bear,\r\nNothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.\r\n\r\n [_Exit_.]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. The Grecian camp. Before Agamemnon’s tent.\r\n\r\n Sennet. Enter Agamemnon, Nestor, Ulysses, Diomedes, Menelaus and\r\n others.\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nPrinces,\r\nWhat grief hath set these jaundies o’er your cheeks?\r\nThe ample proposition that hope makes\r\nIn all designs begun on earth below\r\nFails in the promis’d largeness; checks and disasters\r\nGrow in the veins of actions highest rear’d,\r\nAs knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,\r\nInfects the sound pine, and diverts his grain\r\nTortive and errant from his course of growth.\r\nNor, princes, is it matter new to us\r\nThat we come short of our suppose so far\r\nThat after seven years’ siege yet Troy walls stand;\r\nSith every action that hath gone before,\r\nWhereof we have record, trial did draw\r\nBias and thwart, not answering the aim,\r\nAnd that unbodied figure of the thought\r\nThat gave’t surmised shape. Why then, you princes,\r\nDo you with cheeks abash’d behold our works\r\nAnd call them shames, which are, indeed, naught else\r\nBut the protractive trials of great Jove\r\nTo find persistive constancy in men;\r\nThe fineness of which metal is not found\r\nIn fortune’s love? For then the bold and coward,\r\nThe wise and fool, the artist and unread,\r\nThe hard and soft, seem all affin’d and kin.\r\nBut in the wind and tempest of her frown\r\nDistinction, with a broad and powerful fan,\r\nPuffing at all, winnows the light away;\r\nAnd what hath mass or matter by itself\r\nLies rich in virtue and unmingled.\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\nWith due observance of thy godlike seat,\r\nGreat Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply\r\nThy latest words. In the reproof of chance\r\nLies the true proof of men. The sea being smooth,\r\nHow many shallow bauble boats dare sail\r\nUpon her patient breast, making their way\r\nWith those of nobler bulk!\r\nBut let the ruffian Boreas once enrage\r\nThe gentle Thetis, and anon behold\r\nThe strong-ribb’d bark through liquid mountains cut,\r\nBounding between the two moist elements\r\nLike Perseus’ horse. Where’s then the saucy boat,\r\nWhose weak untimber’d sides but even now\r\nCo-rivall’d greatness? Either to harbour fled\r\nOr made a toast for Neptune. Even so\r\nDoth valour’s show and valour’s worth divide\r\nIn storms of fortune; for in her ray and brightness\r\nThe herd hath more annoyance by the breeze\r\nThan by the tiger; but when the splitting wind\r\nMakes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,\r\nAnd flies fled under shade—why, then the thing of courage,\r\nAs rous’d with rage, with rage doth sympathise,\r\nAnd with an accent tun’d in self-same key\r\nRetorts to chiding fortune.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nAgamemnon,\r\nThou great commander, nerve and bone of Greece,\r\nHeart of our numbers, soul and only spirit\r\nIn whom the tempers and the minds of all\r\nShould be shut up—hear what Ulysses speaks.\r\nBesides th’applause and approbation\r\nThe which, [_To Agamemnon_] most mighty, for thy place and sway,\r\n[_To Nestor_] And, thou most reverend, for thy stretch’d-out life,\r\nI give to both your speeches—which were such\r\nAs Agamemnon and the hand of Greece\r\nShould hold up high in brass; and such again\r\nAs venerable Nestor, hatch’d in silver,\r\nShould with a bond of air, strong as the axle-tree\r\nOn which heaven rides, knit all the Greekish ears\r\nTo his experienc’d tongue—yet let it please both,\r\nThou great, and wise, to hear Ulysses speak.\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nSpeak, Prince of Ithaca; and be’t of less expect\r\nThat matter needless, of importless burden,\r\nDivide thy lips than we are confident,\r\nWhen rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws,\r\nWe shall hear music, wit, and oracle.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nTroy, yet upon his basis, had been down,\r\nAnd the great Hector’s sword had lack’d a master,\r\nBut for these instances:\r\nThe specialty of rule hath been neglected;\r\nAnd look how many Grecian tents do stand\r\nHollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.\r\nWhen that the general is not like the hive,\r\nTo whom the foragers shall all repair,\r\nWhat honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,\r\nTh’unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.\r\nThe heavens themselves, the planets, and this centre,\r\nObserve degree, priority, and place,\r\nInsisture, course, proportion, season, form,\r\nOffice, and custom, in all line of order;\r\nAnd therefore is the glorious planet Sol\r\nIn noble eminence enthron’d and spher’d\r\nAmidst the other, whose med’cinable eye\r\nCorrects the influence of evil planets,\r\nAnd posts, like the commandment of a king,\r\nSans check, to good and bad. But when the planets\r\nIn evil mixture to disorder wander,\r\nWhat plagues and what portents, what mutiny,\r\nWhat raging of the sea, shaking of earth,\r\nCommotion in the winds! Frights, changes, horrors,\r\nDivert and crack, rend and deracinate,\r\nThe unity and married calm of states\r\nQuite from their fixture! O, when degree is shak’d,\r\nWhich is the ladder of all high designs,\r\nThe enterprise is sick! How could communities,\r\nDegrees in schools, and brotherhoods in cities,\r\nPeaceful commerce from dividable shores,\r\nThe primogenity and due of birth,\r\nPrerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,\r\nBut by degree stand in authentic place?\r\nTake but degree away, untune that string,\r\nAnd hark what discord follows! Each thing melts\r\nIn mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters\r\nShould lift their bosoms higher than the shores,\r\nAnd make a sop of all this solid globe;\r\nStrength should be lord of imbecility,\r\nAnd the rude son should strike his father dead;\r\nForce should be right; or, rather, right and wrong—\r\nBetween whose endless jar justice resides—\r\nShould lose their names, and so should justice too.\r\nThen everything includes itself in power,\r\nPower into will, will into appetite;\r\nAnd appetite, an universal wolf,\r\nSo doubly seconded with will and power,\r\nMust make perforce an universal prey,\r\nAnd last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,\r\nThis chaos, when degree is suffocate,\r\nFollows the choking.\r\nAnd this neglection of degree it is\r\nThat by a pace goes backward, with a purpose\r\nIt hath to climb. The general’s disdain’d\r\nBy him one step below, he by the next,\r\nThat next by him beneath; so every step,\r\nExampl’d by the first pace that is sick\r\nOf his superior, grows to an envious fever\r\nOf pale and bloodless emulation.\r\nAnd ’tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,\r\nNot her own sinews. To end a tale of length,\r\nTroy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\nMost wisely hath Ulysses here discover’d\r\nThe fever whereof all our power is sick.\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nThe nature of the sickness found, Ulysses,\r\nWhat is the remedy?\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nThe great Achilles, whom opinion crowns\r\nThe sinew and the forehand of our host,\r\nHaving his ear full of his airy fame,\r\nGrows dainty of his worth, and in his tent\r\nLies mocking our designs; with him Patroclus\r\nUpon a lazy bed the livelong day\r\nBreaks scurril jests;\r\nAnd with ridiculous and awkward action—\r\nWhich, slanderer, he imitation calls—\r\nHe pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,\r\nThy topless deputation he puts on;\r\nAnd like a strutting player whose conceit\r\nLies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich\r\nTo hear the wooden dialogue and sound\r\n’Twixt his stretch’d footing and the scaffoldage—\r\nSuch to-be-pitied and o’er-wrested seeming\r\nHe acts thy greatness in; and when he speaks\r\n’Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquar’d,\r\nWhich, from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp’d,\r\nWould seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff\r\nThe large Achilles, on his press’d bed lolling,\r\nFrom his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;\r\nCries ‘Excellent! ’Tis Agamemnon right!\r\nNow play me Nestor; hem, and stroke thy beard,\r\nAs he being drest to some oration.’\r\nThat’s done—as near as the extremest ends\r\nOf parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife;\r\nYet god Achilles still cries ‘Excellent!\r\n’Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,\r\nArming to answer in a night alarm.’\r\nAnd then, forsooth, the faint defects of age\r\nMust be the scene of mirth: to cough and spit\r\nAnd, with a palsy fumbling on his gorget,\r\nShake in and out the rivet. And at this sport\r\nSir Valour dies; cries ‘O, enough, Patroclus;\r\nOr give me ribs of steel! I shall split all\r\nIn pleasure of my spleen.’ And in this fashion\r\nAll our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,\r\nSeverals and generals of grace exact,\r\nAchievements, plots, orders, preventions,\r\nExcitements to the field or speech for truce,\r\nSuccess or loss, what is or is not, serves\r\nAs stuff for these two to make paradoxes.\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\nAnd in the imitation of these twain—\r\nWho, as Ulysses says, opinion crowns\r\nWith an imperial voice—many are infect.\r\nAjax is grown self-will’d and bears his head\r\nIn such a rein, in full as proud a place\r\nAs broad Achilles; keeps his tent like him;\r\nMakes factious feasts; rails on our state of war\r\nBold as an oracle, and sets Thersites,\r\nA slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,\r\nTo match us in comparisons with dirt,\r\nTo weaken and discredit our exposure,\r\nHow rank soever rounded in with danger.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nThey tax our policy and call it cowardice,\r\nCount wisdom as no member of the war,\r\nForestall prescience, and esteem no act\r\nBut that of hand. The still and mental parts\r\nThat do contrive how many hands shall strike\r\nWhen fitness calls them on, and know, by measure\r\nOf their observant toil, the enemies’ weight—\r\nWhy, this hath not a finger’s dignity:\r\nThey call this bed-work, mapp’ry, closet-war;\r\nSo that the ram that batters down the wall,\r\nFor the great swinge and rudeness of his poise,\r\nThey place before his hand that made the engine,\r\nOr those that with the fineness of their souls\r\nBy reason guide his execution.\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\nLet this be granted, and Achilles’ horse\r\nMakes many Thetis’ sons.\r\n\r\n [_Tucket_.]\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nWhat trumpet? Look, Menelaus.\r\n\r\nMENELAUS.\r\nFrom Troy.\r\n\r\n Enter Aeneas.\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nWhat would you fore our tent?\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nIs this great Agamemnon’s tent, I pray you?\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nEven this.\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nMay one that is a herald and a prince\r\nDo a fair message to his kingly eyes?\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nWith surety stronger than Achilles’ arm\r\nFore all the Greekish heads, which with one voice\r\nCall Agamemnon head and general.\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nFair leave and large security. How may\r\nA stranger to those most imperial looks\r\nKnow them from eyes of other mortals?\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nHow?\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nAy;\r\nI ask, that I might waken reverence,\r\nAnd bid the cheek be ready with a blush\r\nModest as morning when she coldly eyes\r\nThe youthful Phoebus.\r\nWhich is that god in office, guiding men?\r\nWhich is the high and mighty Agamemnon?\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nThis Trojan scorns us, or the men of Troy\r\nAre ceremonious courtiers.\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nCourtiers as free, as debonair, unarm’d,\r\nAs bending angels; that’s their fame in peace.\r\nBut when they would seem soldiers, they have galls,\r\nGood arms, strong joints, true swords; and, Jove’s accord,\r\nNothing so full of heart. But peace, Aeneas,\r\nPeace, Trojan; lay thy finger on thy lips.\r\nThe worthiness of praise distains his worth,\r\nIf that the prais’d himself bring the praise forth;\r\nBut what the repining enemy commends,\r\nThat breath fame blows; that praise, sole pure, transcends.\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nSir, you of Troy, call you yourself Aeneas?\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nAy, Greek, that is my name.\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nWhat’s your affairs, I pray you?\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nSir, pardon; ’tis for Agamemnon’s ears.\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON\r\nHe hears naught privately that comes from Troy.\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nNor I from Troy come not to whisper with him;\r\nI bring a trumpet to awake his ear,\r\nTo set his sense on the attentive bent,\r\nAnd then to speak.\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nSpeak frankly as the wind;\r\nIt is not Agamemnon’s sleeping hour.\r\nThat thou shalt know, Trojan, he is awake,\r\nHe tells thee so himself.\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nTrumpet, blow loud,\r\nSend thy brass voice through all these lazy tents;\r\nAnd every Greek of mettle, let him know\r\nWhat Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud.\r\n\r\n [_Sound trumpet_.]\r\n\r\nWe have, great Agamemnon, here in Troy\r\nA prince called Hector—Priam is his father—\r\nWho in this dull and long-continued truce\r\nIs resty grown; he bade me take a trumpet\r\nAnd to this purpose speak: Kings, princes, lords!\r\nIf there be one among the fair’st of Greece\r\nThat holds his honour higher than his ease,\r\nThat feeds his praise more than he fears his peril,\r\nThat knows his valour and knows not his fear,\r\nThat loves his mistress more than in confession\r\nWith truant vows to her own lips he loves,\r\nAnd dare avow her beauty and her worth\r\nIn other arms than hers—to him this challenge.\r\nHector, in view of Trojans and of Greeks,\r\nShall make it good or do his best to do it:\r\nHe hath a lady wiser, fairer, truer,\r\nThan ever Greek did couple in his arms;\r\nAnd will tomorrow with his trumpet call\r\nMid-way between your tents and walls of Troy\r\nTo rouse a Grecian that is true in love.\r\nIf any come, Hector shall honour him;\r\nIf none, he’ll say in Troy, when he retires,\r\nThe Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth\r\nThe splinter of a lance. Even so much.\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nThis shall be told our lovers, Lord Aeneas.\r\nIf none of them have soul in such a kind,\r\nWe left them all at home. But we are soldiers;\r\nAnd may that soldier a mere recreant prove\r\nThat means not, hath not, or is not in love.\r\nIf then one is, or hath, or means to be,\r\nThat one meets Hector; if none else, I am he.\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\nTell him of Nestor, one that was a man\r\nWhen Hector’s grandsire suck’d. He is old now;\r\nBut if there be not in our Grecian host\r\nA noble man that hath one spark of fire\r\nTo answer for his love, tell him from me\r\nI’ll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver,\r\nAnd in my vambrace put this wither’d brawns,\r\nAnd meeting him, will tell him that my lady\r\nWas fairer than his grandam, and as chaste\r\nAs may be in the world. His youth in flood,\r\nI’ll prove this troth with my three drops of blood.\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nNow heavens forfend such scarcity of youth!\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nFair Lord Aeneas, let me touch your hand;\r\nTo our pavilion shall I lead you, sir.\r\nAchilles shall have word of this intent;\r\nSo shall each lord of Greece, from tent to tent.\r\nYourself shall feast with us before you go,\r\nAnd find the welcome of a noble foe.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt all but Ulysses and Nestor_.]\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nNestor!\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\nWhat says Ulysses?\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nI have a young conception in my brain;\r\nBe you my time to bring it to some shape.\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\nWhat is’t?\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nThis ’tis:\r\nBlunt wedges rive hard knots. The seeded pride\r\nThat hath to this maturity blown up\r\nIn rank Achilles must or now be cropp’d\r\nOr, shedding, breed a nursery of like evil\r\nTo overbulk us all.\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\nWell, and how?\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nThis challenge that the gallant Hector sends,\r\nHowever it is spread in general name,\r\nRelates in purpose only to Achilles.\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\nTrue. The purpose is perspicuous even as substance\r\nWhose grossness little characters sum up;\r\nAnd, in the publication, make no strain\r\nBut that Achilles, were his brain as barren\r\nAs banks of Libya—though, Apollo knows,\r\n’Tis dry enough—will with great speed of judgement,\r\nAy, with celerity, find Hector’s purpose\r\nPointing on him.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nAnd wake him to the answer, think you?\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\nWhy, ’tis most meet. Who may you else oppose\r\nThat can from Hector bring those honours off,\r\nIf not Achilles? Though ’t be a sportful combat,\r\nYet in this trial much opinion dwells\r\nFor here the Trojans taste our dear’st repute\r\nWith their fin’st palate; and trust to me, Ulysses,\r\nOur imputation shall be oddly pois’d\r\nIn this vile action; for the success,\r\nAlthough particular, shall give a scantling\r\nOf good or bad unto the general;\r\nAnd in such indexes, although small pricks\r\nTo their subsequent volumes, there is seen\r\nThe baby figure of the giant mass\r\nOf things to come at large. It is suppos’d\r\nHe that meets Hector issues from our choice;\r\nAnd choice, being mutual act of all our souls,\r\nMakes merit her election, and doth boil,\r\nAs ’twere from forth us all, a man distill’d\r\nOut of our virtues; who miscarrying,\r\nWhat heart receives from hence a conquering part,\r\nTo steel a strong opinion to themselves?\r\nWhich entertain’d, limbs are his instruments,\r\nIn no less working than are swords and bows\r\nDirective by the limbs.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nGive pardon to my speech. Therefore ’tis meet\r\nAchilles meet not Hector. Let us, like merchants,\r\nFirst show foul wares, and think perchance they’ll sell;\r\nIf not, the lustre of the better shall exceed\r\nBy showing the worse first. Do not consent\r\nThat ever Hector and Achilles meet;\r\nFor both our honour and our shame in this\r\nAre dogg’d with two strange followers.\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\nI see them not with my old eyes. What are they?\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nWhat glory our Achilles shares from Hector,\r\nWere he not proud, we all should share with him;\r\nBut he already is too insolent;\r\nAnd it were better parch in Afric sun\r\nThan in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes,\r\nShould he scape Hector fair. If he were foil’d,\r\nWhy, then we do our main opinion crush\r\nIn taint of our best man. No, make a lott’ry;\r\nAnd, by device, let blockish Ajax draw\r\nThe sort to fight with Hector. Among ourselves\r\nGive him allowance for the better man;\r\nFor that will physic the great Myrmidon,\r\nWho broils in loud applause, and make him fall\r\nHis crest, that prouder than blue Iris bends.\r\nIf the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,\r\nWe’ll dress him up in voices; if he fail,\r\nYet go we under our opinion still\r\nThat we have better men. But, hit or miss,\r\nOur project’s life this shape of sense assumes—\r\nAjax employ’d plucks down Achilles’ plumes.\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\nNow, Ulysses, I begin to relish thy advice;\r\nAnd I will give a taste thereof forthwith\r\nTo Agamemnon. Go we to him straight.\r\nTwo curs shall tame each other: pride alone\r\nMust tarre the mastiffs on, as ’twere their bone.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt_.]\r\n\nACT II\r\n\r\nSCENE I. The Grecian camp.\r\n\n Enter Ajax and Thersites.\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nThersites!\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nAgamemnon—how if he had boils, full, all over, generally?\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nThersites!\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nAnd those boils did run—say so. Did not the general run then? Were not\r\nthat a botchy core?\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nDog!\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nThen there would come some matter from him;\r\nI see none now.\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nThou bitch-wolf’s son, canst thou not hear? Feel, then.\r\n\r\n [_Strikes him_.]\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nThe plague of Greece upon thee, thou mongrel beef-witted lord!\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nSpeak, then, thou unsalted leaven, speak. I will beat thee into\r\nhandsomeness.\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nI shall sooner rail thee into wit and holiness; but I think thy horse\r\nwill sooner con an oration than thou learn a prayer without book. Thou\r\ncanst strike, canst thou? A red murrain o’ thy jade’s tricks!\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nToadstool, learn me the proclamation.\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nDost thou think I have no sense, thou strikest me thus?\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nThe proclamation!\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nThou art proclaim’d fool, I think.\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nDo not, porpentine, do not; my fingers itch.\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nI would thou didst itch from head to foot and I had the scratching of\r\nthee; I would make thee the loathsomest scab in Greece. When thou art\r\nforth in the incursions, thou strikest as slow as another.\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nI say, the proclamation.\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nThou grumblest and railest every hour on Achilles; and thou art as full\r\nof envy at his greatness as Cerberus is at Proserpina’s beauty—ay, that\r\nthou bark’st at him.\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nMistress Thersites!\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nThou shouldst strike him.\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nCobloaf!\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nHe would pun thee into shivers with his fist, as a sailor breaks a\r\nbiscuit.\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nYou whoreson cur!\r\n\r\n [_Strikes him_.]\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nDo, do.\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nThou stool for a witch!\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nAy, do, do; thou sodden-witted lord! Thou hast no more brain than I\r\nhave in mine elbows; an asinico may tutor thee. You scurvy valiant ass!\r\nThou art here but to thrash Trojans, and thou art bought and sold among\r\nthose of any wit like a barbarian slave. If thou use to beat me, I will\r\nbegin at thy heel and tell what thou art by inches, thou thing of no\r\nbowels, thou!\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nYou dog!\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nYou scurvy lord!\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nYou cur!\r\n\r\n [_Strikes him_.]\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nMars his idiot! Do, rudeness; do, camel; do, do.\r\n\r\n Enter Achilles and Patroclus.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nWhy, how now, Ajax! Wherefore do ye thus?\r\nHow now, Thersites! What’s the matter, man?\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nYou see him there, do you?\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nAy; what’s the matter?\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nNay, look upon him.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nSo I do. What’s the matter?\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nNay, but regard him well.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nWell! why, so I do.\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nBut yet you look not well upon him; for whosomever you take him to be,\r\nhe is Ajax.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nI know that, fool.\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nAy, but that fool knows not himself.\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nTherefore I beat thee.\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nLo, lo, lo, lo, what modicums of wit he utters! His evasions have ears\r\nthus long. I have bobb’d his brain more than he has beat my bones. I\r\nwill buy nine sparrows for a penny, and his pia mater is not worth the\r\nninth part of a sparrow. This lord, Achilles—Ajax, who wears his wit in\r\nhis belly and his guts in his head—I’ll tell you what I say of him.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nWhat?\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nI say this Ajax—\r\n\r\n [_Ajax offers to strike him_.]\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nNay, good Ajax.\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nHas not so much wit—\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nNay, I must hold you.\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nAs will stop the eye of Helen’s needle, for whom he comes to fight.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nPeace, fool.\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nI would have peace and quietness, but the fool will not— he there; that\r\nhe; look you there.\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nO thou damned cur! I shall—\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nWill you set your wit to a fool’s?\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nNo, I warrant you, the fool’s will shame it.\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nGood words, Thersites.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nWhat’s the quarrel?\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nI bade the vile owl go learn me the tenour of the proclamation, and he\r\nrails upon me.\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nI serve thee not.\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nWell, go to, go to.\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nI serve here voluntary.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nYour last service was suff’rance; ’twas not voluntary. No man is beaten\r\nvoluntary. Ajax was here the voluntary, and you as under an impress.\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nE’en so; a great deal of your wit too lies in your sinews, or else\r\nthere be liars. Hector shall have a great catch and knock out either of\r\nyour brains: a’ were as good crack a fusty nut with no kernel.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nWhat, with me too, Thersites?\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nThere’s Ulysses and old Nestor—whose wit was mouldy ere your grandsires\r\nhad nails on their toes—yoke you like draught oxen, and make you plough\r\nup the wars.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nWhat, what?\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nYes, good sooth. To Achilles, to Ajax, to—\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nI shall cut out your tongue.\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\n’Tis no matter; I shall speak as much as thou afterwards.\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nNo more words, Thersites; peace!\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nI will hold my peace when Achilles’ brach bids me, shall I?\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nThere’s for you, Patroclus.\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nI will see you hang’d like clotpoles ere I come any more to your tents.\r\nI will keep where there is wit stirring, and leave the faction of\r\nfools.\r\n\r\n [_Exit_.]\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nA good riddance.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nMarry, this, sir, is proclaim’d through all our host,\r\nThat Hector, by the fifth hour of the sun,\r\nWill with a trumpet ’twixt our tents and Troy,\r\nTomorrow morning, call some knight to arms\r\nThat hath a stomach; and such a one that dare\r\nMaintain I know not what; ’tis trash. Farewell.\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nFarewell. Who shall answer him?\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nI know not; ’tis put to lott’ry, otherwise,\r\nHe knew his man.\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nO, meaning you? I will go learn more of it.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt_.]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. Troy. Priam’s palace.\r\n\r\n Enter Priam, Hector, Troilus, Paris and Helenus.\r\n\r\nPRIAM.\r\nAfter so many hours, lives, speeches spent,\r\nThus once again says Nestor from the Greeks:\r\n‘Deliver Helen, and all damage else—\r\nAs honour, loss of time, travail, expense,\r\nWounds, friends, and what else dear that is consum’d\r\nIn hot digestion of this cormorant war—\r\nShall be struck off.’ Hector, what say you to’t?\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nThough no man lesser fears the Greeks than I,\r\nAs far as toucheth my particular,\r\nYet, dread Priam,\r\nThere is no lady of more softer bowels,\r\nMore spongy to suck in the sense of fear,\r\nMore ready to cry out ‘Who knows what follows?’\r\nThan Hector is. The wound of peace is surety,\r\nSurety secure; but modest doubt is call’d\r\nThe beacon of the wise, the tent that searches\r\nTo th’ bottom of the worst. Let Helen go.\r\nSince the first sword was drawn about this question,\r\nEvery tithe soul ’mongst many thousand dismes\r\nHath been as dear as Helen—I mean, of ours.\r\nIf we have lost so many tenths of ours\r\nTo guard a thing not ours, nor worth to us,\r\nHad it our name, the value of one ten,\r\nWhat merit’s in that reason which denies\r\nThe yielding of her up?\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nFie, fie, my brother!\r\nWeigh you the worth and honour of a king,\r\nSo great as our dread father’s, in a scale\r\nOf common ounces? Will you with counters sum\r\nThe past-proportion of his infinite,\r\nAnd buckle in a waist most fathomless\r\nWith spans and inches so diminutive\r\nAs fears and reasons? Fie, for godly shame!\r\n\r\nHELENUS.\r\nNo marvel though you bite so sharp of reasons,\r\nYou are so empty of them. Should not our father\r\nBear the great sway of his affairs with reason,\r\nBecause your speech hath none that tells him so?\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nYou are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest;\r\nYou fur your gloves with reason. Here are your reasons:\r\nYou know an enemy intends you harm;\r\nYou know a sword employ’d is perilous,\r\nAnd reason flies the object of all harm.\r\nWho marvels, then, when Helenus beholds\r\nA Grecian and his sword, if he do set\r\nThe very wings of reason to his heels\r\nAnd fly like chidden Mercury from Jove,\r\nOr like a star disorb’d? Nay, if we talk of reason,\r\nLet’s shut our gates and sleep. Manhood and honour\r\nShould have hare hearts, would they but fat their thoughts\r\nWith this cramm’d reason. Reason and respect\r\nMake livers pale and lustihood deject.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nBrother, she is not worth what she doth cost the keeping.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nWhat’s aught but as ’tis valued?\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nBut value dwells not in particular will:\r\nIt holds his estimate and dignity\r\nAs well wherein ’tis precious of itself\r\nAs in the prizer. ’Tis mad idolatry\r\nTo make the service greater than the god,\r\nAnd the will dotes that is attributive\r\nTo what infectiously itself affects,\r\nWithout some image of th’affected merit.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nI take today a wife, and my election\r\nIs led on in the conduct of my will;\r\nMy will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,\r\nTwo traded pilots ’twixt the dangerous shores\r\nOf will and judgement: how may I avoid,\r\nAlthough my will distaste what it elected,\r\nThe wife I chose? There can be no evasion\r\nTo blench from this and to stand firm by honour.\r\nWe turn not back the silks upon the merchant\r\nWhen we have soil’d them; nor the remainder viands\r\nWe do not throw in unrespective sieve,\r\nBecause we now are full. It was thought meet\r\nParis should do some vengeance on the Greeks;\r\nYour breath with full consent bellied his sails;\r\nThe seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce,\r\nAnd did him service. He touch’d the ports desir’d;\r\nAnd for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive\r\nHe brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and freshness\r\nWrinkles Apollo’s, and makes stale the morning.\r\nWhy keep we her? The Grecians keep our aunt.\r\nIs she worth keeping? Why, she is a pearl\r\nWhose price hath launch’d above a thousand ships,\r\nAnd turn’d crown’d kings to merchants.\r\nIf you’ll avouch ’twas wisdom Paris went—\r\nAs you must needs, for you all cried ‘Go, go’—\r\nIf you’ll confess he brought home worthy prize—\r\nAs you must needs, for you all clapp’d your hands,\r\nAnd cried ‘Inestimable!’—why do you now\r\nThe issue of your proper wisdoms rate,\r\nAnd do a deed that never Fortune did—\r\nBeggar the estimation which you priz’d\r\nRicher than sea and land? O theft most base,\r\nThat we have stol’n what we do fear to keep!\r\nBut thieves unworthy of a thing so stol’n\r\nThat in their country did them that disgrace\r\nWe fear to warrant in our native place!\r\n\r\nCASSANDRA.\r\n[_Within_.] Cry, Trojans, cry.\r\n\r\nPRIAM.\r\nWhat noise, what shriek is this?\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\n’Tis our mad sister; I do know her voice.\r\n\r\nCASSANDRA.\r\n[_Within_.] Cry, Trojans.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nIt is Cassandra.\r\n\r\n Enter Cassandra, raving.\r\n\r\nCASSANDRA.\r\nCry, Trojans, cry. Lend me ten thousand eyes,\r\nAnd I will fill them with prophetic tears.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nPeace, sister, peace.\r\n\r\nCASSANDRA.\r\nVirgins and boys, mid-age and wrinkled eld,\r\nSoft infancy, that nothing canst but cry,\r\nAdd to my clamours. Let us pay betimes\r\nA moiety of that mass of moan to come.\r\nCry, Trojans, cry. Practise your eyes with tears.\r\nTroy must not be, nor goodly Ilion stand;\r\nOur firebrand brother, Paris, burns us all.\r\nCry, Trojans, cry, A Helen and a woe!\r\nCry, cry. Troy burns, or else let Helen go.\r\n\r\n [_Exit_.]\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nNow, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains\r\nOf divination in our sister work\r\nSome touches of remorse? Or is your blood\r\nSo madly hot, that no discourse of reason,\r\nNor fear of bad success in a bad cause,\r\nCan qualify the same?\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nWhy, brother Hector,\r\nWe may not think the justness of each act\r\nSuch and no other than event doth form it;\r\nNor once deject the courage of our minds\r\nBecause Cassandra’s mad. Her brain-sick raptures\r\nCannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel\r\nWhich hath our several honours all engag’d\r\nTo make it gracious. For my private part,\r\nI am no more touch’d than all Priam’s sons;\r\nAnd Jove forbid there should be done amongst us\r\nSuch things as might offend the weakest spleen\r\nTo fight for and maintain.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nElse might the world convince of levity\r\nAs well my undertakings as your counsels;\r\nBut I attest the gods, your full consent\r\nGave wings to my propension, and cut off\r\nAll fears attending on so dire a project.\r\nFor what, alas, can these my single arms?\r\nWhat propugnation is in one man’s valour\r\nTo stand the push and enmity of those\r\nThis quarrel would excite? Yet I protest,\r\nWere I alone to pass the difficulties,\r\nAnd had as ample power as I have will,\r\nParis should ne’er retract what he hath done,\r\nNor faint in the pursuit.\r\n\r\nPRIAM.\r\nParis, you speak\r\nLike one besotted on your sweet delights.\r\nYou have the honey still, but these the gall;\r\nSo to be valiant is no praise at all.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nSir, I propose not merely to myself\r\nThe pleasures such a beauty brings with it;\r\nBut I would have the soil of her fair rape\r\nWip’d off in honourable keeping her.\r\nWhat treason were it to the ransack’d queen,\r\nDisgrace to your great worths, and shame to me,\r\nNow to deliver her possession up\r\nOn terms of base compulsion! Can it be,\r\nThat so degenerate a strain as this\r\nShould once set footing in your generous bosoms?\r\nThere’s not the meanest spirit on our party\r\nWithout a heart to dare or sword to draw\r\nWhen Helen is defended; nor none so noble\r\nWhose life were ill bestow’d or death unfam’d,\r\nWhere Helen is the subject. Then, I say,\r\nWell may we fight for her whom we know well\r\nThe world’s large spaces cannot parallel.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nParis and Troilus, you have both said well;\r\nAnd on the cause and question now in hand\r\nHave gloz’d, but superficially; not much\r\nUnlike young men, whom Aristotle thought\r\nUnfit to hear moral philosophy.\r\nThe reasons you allege do more conduce\r\nTo the hot passion of distemp’red blood\r\nThan to make up a free determination\r\n’Twixt right and wrong; for pleasure and revenge\r\nHave ears more deaf than adders to the voice\r\nOf any true decision. Nature craves\r\nAll dues be rend’red to their owners. Now,\r\nWhat nearer debt in all humanity\r\nThan wife is to the husband? If this law\r\nOf nature be corrupted through affection;\r\nAnd that great minds, of partial indulgence\r\nTo their benumbed wills, resist the same;\r\nThere is a law in each well-order’d nation\r\nTo curb those raging appetites that are\r\nMost disobedient and refractory.\r\nIf Helen, then, be wife to Sparta’s king—\r\nAs it is known she is—these moral laws\r\nOf nature and of nations speak aloud\r\nTo have her back return’d. Thus to persist\r\nIn doing wrong extenuates not wrong,\r\nBut makes it much more heavy. Hector’s opinion\r\nIs this, in way of truth. Yet, ne’ertheless,\r\nMy spritely brethren, I propend to you\r\nIn resolution to keep Helen still;\r\nFor ’tis a cause that hath no mean dependence\r\nUpon our joint and several dignities.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nWhy, there you touch’d the life of our design.\r\nWere it not glory that we more affected\r\nThan the performance of our heaving spleens,\r\nI would not wish a drop of Trojan blood\r\nSpent more in her defence. But, worthy Hector,\r\nShe is a theme of honour and renown,\r\nA spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,\r\nWhose present courage may beat down our foes,\r\nAnd fame in time to come canonize us;\r\nFor I presume brave Hector would not lose\r\nSo rich advantage of a promis’d glory\r\nAs smiles upon the forehead of this action\r\nFor the wide world’s revenue.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nI am yours,\r\nYou valiant offspring of great Priamus.\r\nI have a roisting challenge sent amongst\r\nThe dull and factious nobles of the Greeks\r\nWill strike amazement to their drowsy spirits.\r\nI was advertis’d their great general slept,\r\nWhilst emulation in the army crept.\r\nThis, I presume, will wake him.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt_.]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. The Grecian camp. Before the tent of Achilles.\r\n\r\n Enter Thersites, solus.\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nHow now, Thersites! What, lost in the labyrinth of thy fury? Shall the\r\nelephant Ajax carry it thus? He beats me, and I rail at him. O worthy\r\nsatisfaction! Would it were otherwise: that I could beat him, whilst he\r\nrail’d at me! ‘Sfoot, I’ll learn to conjure and raise devils, but I’ll\r\nsee some issue of my spiteful execrations. Then there’s Achilles, a\r\nrare engineer! If Troy be not taken till these two undermine it, the\r\nwalls will stand till they fall of themselves. O thou great\r\nthunder-darter of Olympus, forget that thou art Jove, the king of gods,\r\nand, Mercury, lose all the serpentine craft of thy caduceus, if ye take\r\nnot that little little less than little wit from them that they have!\r\nwhich short-arm’d ignorance itself knows is so abundant scarce, it will\r\nnot in circumvention deliver a fly from a spider without drawing their\r\nmassy irons and cutting the web. After this, the vengeance on the whole\r\ncamp! or, rather, the Neapolitan bone-ache! for that, methinks, is the\r\ncurse depending on those that war for a placket. I have said my\r\nprayers; and devil Envy say ‘Amen.’ What ho! my Lord Achilles!\r\n\r\n Enter Patroclus.\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nWho’s there? Thersites! Good Thersites, come in and rail.\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nIf I could a’ rememb’red a gilt counterfeit, thou wouldst not have\r\nslipp’d out of my contemplation; but it is no matter; thyself upon\r\nthyself! The common curse of mankind, folly and ignorance, be thine in\r\ngreat revenue! Heaven bless thee from a tutor, and discipline come not\r\nnear thee! Let thy blood be thy direction till thy death. Then if she\r\nthat lays thee out says thou art a fair corse, I’ll be sworn and sworn\r\nupon’t she never shrouded any but lazars. Amen. Where’s Achilles?\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nWhat, art thou devout? Wast thou in prayer?\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nAy, the heavens hear me!\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n Enter Achilles.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nWho’s there?\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nThersites, my lord.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nWhere, where? O, where? Art thou come? Why, my cheese, my digestion,\r\nwhy hast thou not served thyself in to my table so many meals? Come,\r\nwhat’s Agamemnon?\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nThy commander, Achilles. Then tell me, Patroclus, what’s Achilles?\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nThy lord, Thersites. Then tell me, I pray thee, what’s Thersites?\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nThy knower, Patroclus. Then tell me, Patroclus, what art thou?\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nThou must tell that knowest.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nO, tell, tell,\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nI’ll decline the whole question. Agamemnon commands Achilles; Achilles\r\nis my lord; I am Patroclus’ knower; and Patroclus is a fool.\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nYou rascal!\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nPeace, fool! I have not done.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nHe is a privileg’d man. Proceed, Thersites.\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nAgamemnon is a fool; Achilles is a fool; Thersites is a fool; and, as\r\naforesaid, Patroclus is a fool.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nDerive this; come.\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nAgamemnon is a fool to offer to command Achilles; Achilles is a fool to\r\nbe commanded of Agamemnon; Thersites is a fool to serve such a fool;\r\nand this Patroclus is a fool positive.\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nWhy am I a fool?\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nMake that demand of the Creator. It suffices me thou art. Look you, who\r\ncomes here?\r\n\r\n Enter Agamemnon, Ulysses, Nestor, Diomedes, Ajax and Calchas.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nCome, Patroclus, I’ll speak with nobody. Come in with me, Thersites.\r\n\r\n [_Exit_.]\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nHere is such patchery, such juggling, and such knavery. All the\r\nargument is a whore and a cuckold—a good quarrel to draw emulous\r\nfactions and bleed to death upon. Now the dry serpigo on the subject,\r\nand war and lechery confound all!\r\n\r\n [_Exit_.]\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nWhere is Achilles?\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nWithin his tent; but ill-dispos’d, my lord.\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nLet it be known to him that we are here.\r\nHe shent our messengers; and we lay by\r\nOur appertainings, visiting of him.\r\nLet him be told so; lest, perchance, he think\r\nWe dare not move the question of our place\r\nOr know not what we are.\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nI shall say so to him.\r\n\r\n [_Exit_.]\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nWe saw him at the opening of his tent.\r\nHe is not sick.\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nYes, lion-sick, sick of proud heart. You may call it melancholy, if you\r\nwill favour the man; but, by my head, ’tis pride. But why, why? Let him\r\nshow us a cause. A word, my lord.\r\n\r\n [_Takes Agamemnon aside_.]\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\nWhat moves Ajax thus to bay at him?\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nAchilles hath inveigled his fool from him.\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\nWho, Thersites?\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nHe.\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\nThen will Ajax lack matter, if he have lost his argument.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nNo; you see he is his argument that has his argument, Achilles.\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\nAll the better; their fraction is more our wish than their faction. But\r\nit was a strong composure a fool could disunite!\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nThe amity that wisdom knits not, folly may easily untie.\r\n\r\n Re-enter Patroclus.\r\n\r\nHere comes Patroclus.\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\nNo Achilles with him.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nThe elephant hath joints, but none for courtesy; his legs are legs for\r\nnecessity, not for flexure.\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nAchilles bids me say he is much sorry\r\nIf any thing more than your sport and pleasure\r\nDid move your greatness and this noble state\r\nTo call upon him; he hopes it is no other\r\nBut for your health and your digestion sake,\r\nAn after-dinner’s breath.\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nHear you, Patroclus.\r\nWe are too well acquainted with these answers;\r\nBut his evasion, wing’d thus swift with scorn,\r\nCannot outfly our apprehensions.\r\nMuch attribute he hath, and much the reason\r\nWhy we ascribe it to him. Yet all his virtues,\r\nNot virtuously on his own part beheld,\r\nDo in our eyes begin to lose their gloss;\r\nYea, like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish,\r\nAre like to rot untasted. Go and tell him\r\nWe come to speak with him; and you shall not sin\r\nIf you do say we think him over-proud\r\nAnd under-honest, in self-assumption greater\r\nThan in the note of judgement; and worthier than himself\r\nHere tend the savage strangeness he puts on,\r\nDisguise the holy strength of their command,\r\nAnd underwrite in an observing kind\r\nHis humorous predominance; yea, watch\r\nHis course and time, his ebbs and flows, as if\r\nThe passage and whole stream of this commencement\r\nRode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add\r\nThat if he overhold his price so much\r\nWe’ll none of him, but let him, like an engine\r\nNot portable, lie under this report:\r\nBring action hither; this cannot go to war.\r\nA stirring dwarf we do allowance give\r\nBefore a sleeping giant. Tell him so.\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nI shall, and bring his answer presently.\r\n\r\n [_Exit_.]\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nIn second voice we’ll not be satisfied;\r\nWe come to speak with him. Ulysses, enter you.\r\n\r\n [_Exit_ Ulysses.]\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nWhat is he more than another?\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nNo more than what he thinks he is.\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nIs he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself a better man than I\r\nam?\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nNo question.\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nWill you subscribe his thought and say he is?\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nNo, noble Ajax; you are as strong, as valiant, as wise, no less noble,\r\nmuch more gentle, and altogether more tractable.\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nWhy should a man be proud? How doth pride grow? I know not what pride\r\nis.\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nYour mind is the clearer, Ajax, and your virtues the fairer. He that is\r\nproud eats up himself. Pride is his own glass, his own trumpet, his own\r\nchronicle; and whatever praises itself but in the deed devours the deed\r\nin the praise.\r\n\r\n Re-enter Ulysses.\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nI do hate a proud man as I do hate the engend’ring of toads.\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\n[_Aside._] And yet he loves himself: is’t not strange?\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nAchilles will not to the field tomorrow.\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nWhat’s his excuse?\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nHe doth rely on none;\r\nBut carries on the stream of his dispose,\r\nWithout observance or respect of any,\r\nIn will peculiar and in self-admission.\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nWhy will he not, upon our fair request,\r\nUntent his person and share th’air with us?\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nThings small as nothing, for request’s sake only,\r\nHe makes important; possess’d he is with greatness,\r\nAnd speaks not to himself but with a pride\r\nThat quarrels at self-breath. Imagin’d worth\r\nHolds in his blood such swol’n and hot discourse\r\nThat ’twixt his mental and his active parts\r\nKingdom’d Achilles in commotion rages,\r\nAnd batters down himself. What should I say?\r\nHe is so plaguy proud that the death tokens of it\r\nCry ‘No recovery.’\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nLet Ajax go to him.\r\nDear lord, go you and greet him in his tent.\r\n’Tis said he holds you well; and will be led\r\nAt your request a little from himself.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nO Agamemnon, let it not be so!\r\nWe’ll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes\r\nWhen they go from Achilles. Shall the proud lord\r\nThat bastes his arrogance with his own seam\r\nAnd never suffers matter of the world\r\nEnter his thoughts, save such as doth revolve\r\nAnd ruminate himself—shall he be worshipp’d\r\nOf that we hold an idol more than he?\r\nNo, this thrice worthy and right valiant lord\r\nShall not so stale his palm, nobly acquir’d,\r\nNor, by my will, assubjugate his merit,\r\nAs amply titled as Achilles is,\r\nBy going to Achilles.\r\nThat were to enlard his fat-already pride,\r\nAnd add more coals to Cancer when he burns\r\nWith entertaining great Hyperion.\r\nThis lord go to him! Jupiter forbid,\r\nAnd say in thunder ‘Achilles go to him.’\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\n[_Aside_.] O, this is well! He rubs the vein of him.\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\n[_Aside_.] And how his silence drinks up this applause!\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nIf I go to him, with my armed fist I’ll pash him o’er the face.\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nO, no, you shall not go.\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nAn a’ be proud with me I’ll pheeze his pride.\r\nLet me go to him.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nNot for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel.\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nA paltry, insolent fellow!\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\n[_Aside_.] How he describes himself!\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nCan he not be sociable?\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\n[_Aside_.] The raven chides blackness.\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nI’ll let his humours blood.\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\n[_Aside_.] He will be the physician that should be the patient.\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nAnd all men were o’ my mind—\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\n[_Aside_.] Wit would be out of fashion.\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nA’ should not bear it so, a’ should eat’s words first.\r\nShall pride carry it?\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\n[_Aside_.] And ’twould, you’d carry half.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\n[_Aside_.] A’ would have ten shares.\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nI will knead him, I’ll make him supple.\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\n[_Aside_.] He’s not yet through warm. Force him with praises; pour in,\r\npour in; his ambition is dry.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\n[_To Agamemnon_.] My lord, you feed too much on this dislike.\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\nOur noble general, do not do so.\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nYou must prepare to fight without Achilles.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nWhy ’tis this naming of him does him harm.\r\nHere is a man—but ’tis before his face;\r\nI will be silent.\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\nWherefore should you so?\r\nHe is not emulous, as Achilles is.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nKnow the whole world, he is as valiant.\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nA whoreson dog, that shall palter with us thus!\r\nWould he were a Trojan!\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\nWhat a vice were it in Ajax now—\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nIf he were proud.\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nOr covetous of praise.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nAy, or surly borne.\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nOr strange, or self-affected.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nThank the heavens, lord, thou art of sweet composure.\r\nPraise him that gat thee, she that gave thee suck;\r\nFam’d be thy tutor, and thy parts of nature\r\nThrice fam’d beyond, beyond all erudition;\r\nBut he that disciplin’d thine arms to fight—\r\nLet Mars divide eternity in twain\r\nAnd give him half; and, for thy vigour,\r\nBull-bearing Milo his addition yield\r\nTo sinewy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom,\r\nWhich, like a bourn, a pale, a shore, confines\r\nThy spacious and dilated parts. Here’s Nestor,\r\nInstructed by the antiquary times—\r\nHe must, he is, he cannot but be wise;\r\nBut pardon, father Nestor, were your days\r\nAs green as Ajax’ and your brain so temper’d,\r\nYou should not have the eminence of him,\r\nBut be as Ajax.\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nShall I call you father?\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\nAy, my good son.\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nBe rul’d by him, Lord Ajax.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nThere is no tarrying here; the hart Achilles\r\nKeeps thicket. Please it our great general\r\nTo call together all his state of war;\r\nFresh kings are come to Troy. Tomorrow\r\nWe must with all our main of power stand fast;\r\nAnd here’s a lord—come knights from east to west\r\nAnd cull their flower, Ajax shall cope the best.\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nGo we to council. Let Achilles sleep.\r\nLight boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt_.]\r\n\nACT III\r\n\r\nSCENE I. Troy. Priam’s palace.\r\n\n Music sounds within. Enter Pandarus and a Servant.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nFriend, you—pray you, a word. Do you not follow the young Lord Paris?\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nAy, sir, when he goes before me.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nYou depend upon him, I mean?\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nSir, I do depend upon the Lord.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nYou depend upon a notable gentleman; I must needs praise him.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nThe Lord be praised!\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nYou know me, do you not?\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nFaith, sir, superficially.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nFriend, know me better: I am the Lord Pandarus.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nI hope I shall know your honour better.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nI do desire it.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nYou are in the state of grace?\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nGrace? Not so, friend; honour and lordship are my titles. What music is\r\nthis?\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nI do but partly know, sir; it is music in parts.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nKnow you the musicians?\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nWholly, sir.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nWho play they to?\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nTo the hearers, sir.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nAt whose pleasure, friend?\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nAt mine, sir, and theirs that love music.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nCommand, I mean, friend.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nWho shall I command, sir?\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nFriend, we understand not one another: I am too courtly, and thou art\r\ntoo cunning. At whose request do these men play?\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nThat’s to’t, indeed, sir. Marry, sir, at the request of Paris my lord,\r\nwho is there in person; with him the mortal Venus, the heart-blood of\r\nbeauty, love’s invisible soul—\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nWho, my cousin, Cressida?\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nNo, sir, Helen. Could not you find out that by her attributes?\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nIt should seem, fellow, that thou hast not seen the Lady Cressida. I\r\ncome to speak with Paris from the Prince Troilus; I will make a\r\ncomplimental assault upon him, for my business seethes.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nSodden business! There’s a stew’d phrase indeed!\r\n\r\n Enter Paris and Helen, attended.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nFair be to you, my lord, and to all this fair company! Fair desires, in\r\nall fair measure, fairly guide them—especially to you, fair queen! Fair\r\nthoughts be your fair pillow.\r\n\r\nHELEN.\r\nDear lord, you are full of fair words.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nYou speak your fair pleasure, sweet queen. Fair prince, here is good\r\nbroken music.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nYou have broke it, cousin; and by my life, you shall make it whole\r\nagain; you shall piece it out with a piece of your performance.\r\n\r\nHELEN.\r\nHe is full of harmony.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nTruly, lady, no.\r\n\r\nHELEN.\r\nO, sir—\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nRude, in sooth; in good sooth, very rude.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nWell said, my lord. Well, you say so in fits.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nI have business to my lord, dear queen. My lord, will you vouchsafe me\r\na word?\r\n\r\nHELEN.\r\nNay, this shall not hedge us out. We’ll hear you sing, certainly—\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nWell sweet queen, you are pleasant with me. But, marry, thus, my lord:\r\nmy dear lord and most esteemed friend, your brother Troilus—\r\n\r\nHELEN.\r\nMy Lord Pandarus, honey-sweet lord—\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nGo to, sweet queen, go to—commends himself most affectionately to you—\r\n\r\nHELEN.\r\nYou shall not bob us out of our melody. If you do, our melancholy upon\r\nyour head!\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nSweet queen, sweet queen; that’s a sweet queen, i’ faith.\r\n\r\nHELEN.\r\nAnd to make a sweet lady sad is a sour offence.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nNay, that shall not serve your turn; that shall it not, in truth, la.\r\nNay, I care not for such words; no, no.—And, my lord, he desires you\r\nthat, if the King call for him at supper, you will make his excuse.\r\n\r\nHELEN.\r\nMy Lord Pandarus!\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nWhat says my sweet queen, my very very sweet queen?\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nWhat exploit’s in hand? Where sups he tonight?\r\n\r\nHELEN.\r\nNay, but, my lord—\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nWhat says my sweet queen?—My cousin will fall out with you.\r\n\r\nHELEN.\r\nYou must not know where he sups.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nI’ll lay my life, with my disposer Cressida.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nNo, no, no such matter; you are wide. Come, your disposer is sick.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nWell, I’ll make’s excuse.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nAy, good my lord. Why should you say Cressida?\r\nNo, your poor disposer’s sick.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nI spy.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nYou spy! What do you spy?—Come, give me an instrument. Now, sweet\r\nqueen.\r\n\r\nHELEN.\r\nWhy, this is kindly done.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nMy niece is horribly in love with a thing you have, sweet queen.\r\n\r\nHELEN.\r\nShe shall have it, my lord, if it be not my Lord Paris.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nHe? No, she’ll none of him; they two are twain.\r\n\r\nHELEN.\r\nFalling in, after falling out, may make them three.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nCome, come. I’ll hear no more of this; I’ll sing you a song now.\r\n\r\nHELEN.\r\nAy, ay, prithee now. By my troth, sweet lord, thou hast a fine\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nAy, you may, you may.\r\n\r\nHELEN.\r\nLet thy song be love. This love will undo us all. O Cupid, Cupid,\r\nCupid!\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nLove! Ay, that it shall, i’ faith.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nAy, good now, love, love, nothing but love.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nIn good troth, it begins so.\r\n\r\n [_Sings_.]\r\n\n _Love, love, nothing but love, still love, still more!\r\n For, oh, love’s bow\r\n Shoots buck and doe;\r\n The shaft confounds\r\n Not that it wounds,\r\n But tickles still the sore.\r\n These lovers cry, O ho, they die!\r\n Yet that which seems the wound to kill\r\n Doth turn O ho! to ha! ha! he!\r\n So dying love lives still.\r\n O ho! a while, but ha! ha! ha!\r\n O ho! groans out for ha! ha! ha!—hey ho!_\r\n\r\nHELEN.\r\nIn love, i’ faith, to the very tip of the nose.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nHe eats nothing but doves, love; and that breeds hot blood, and hot\r\nblood begets hot thoughts, and hot thoughts beget hot deeds, and hot\r\ndeeds is love.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nIs this the generation of love: hot blood, hot thoughts, and hot deeds?\r\nWhy, they are vipers. Is love a generation of vipers? Sweet lord, who’s\r\na-field today?\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nHector, Deiphobus, Helenus, Antenor, and all the gallantry of Troy. I\r\nwould fain have arm’d today, but my Nell would not have it so. How\r\nchance my brother Troilus went not?\r\n\r\nHELEN.\r\nHe hangs the lip at something. You know all, Lord Pandarus.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nNot I, honey-sweet queen. I long to hear how they spend today. You’ll\r\nremember your brother’s excuse?\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nTo a hair.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nFarewell, sweet queen.\r\n\r\nHELEN.\r\nCommend me to your niece.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nI will, sweet queen.\r\n\r\n [_Exit. Sound a retreat_.]\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nThey’re come from the field. Let us to Priam’s hall\r\nTo greet the warriors. Sweet Helen, I must woo you\r\nTo help unarm our Hector. His stubborn buckles,\r\nWith these your white enchanting fingers touch’d,\r\nShall more obey than to the edge of steel\r\nOr force of Greekish sinews; you shall do more\r\nThan all the island kings—disarm great Hector.\r\n\r\nHELEN.\r\n’Twill make us proud to be his servant, Paris;\r\nYea, what he shall receive of us in duty\r\nGives us more palm in beauty than we have,\r\nYea, overshines ourself.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nSweet, above thought I love thee.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt_.]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. Troy. Pandarus’ orchard.\r\n\r\n Enter Pandarus and Troilus’ Boy, meeting.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nHow now! Where’s thy master? At my cousin Cressida’s?\r\n\r\nBOY.\r\nNo, sir; he stays for you to conduct him thither.\r\n\r\n Enter Troilus.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nO, here he comes. How now, how now?\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nSirrah, walk off.\r\n\r\n [_Exit_ Boy.]\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nHave you seen my cousin?\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nNo, Pandarus. I stalk about her door\r\nLike a strange soul upon the Stygian banks\r\nStaying for waftage. O, be thou my Charon,\r\nAnd give me swift transportance to these fields\r\nWhere I may wallow in the lily beds\r\nPropos’d for the deserver! O gentle Pandar,\r\nfrom Cupid’s shoulder pluck his painted wings,\r\nand fly with me to Cressid!\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nWalk here i’ th’ orchard, I’ll bring her straight.\r\n\r\n [_Exit_.]\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nI am giddy; expectation whirls me round.\r\nTh’imaginary relish is so sweet\r\nThat it enchants my sense; what will it be\r\nWhen that the wat’ry palate tastes indeed\r\nLove’s thrice-repured nectar? Death, I fear me;\r\nSounding destruction; or some joy too fine,\r\nToo subtle-potent, tun’d too sharp in sweetness,\r\nFor the capacity of my ruder powers.\r\nI fear it much; and I do fear besides\r\nThat I shall lose distinction in my joys;\r\nAs doth a battle, when they charge on heaps\r\nThe enemy flying.\r\n\r\n Re-enter Pandarus.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nShe’s making her ready, she’ll come straight; you must be witty now.\r\nShe does so blush, and fetches her wind so short, as if she were fray’d\r\nwith a sprite. I’ll fetch her. It is the prettiest villain; she fetches\r\nher breath as short as a new-ta’en sparrow.\r\n\r\n [_Exit_.]\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nEven such a passion doth embrace my bosom.\r\nMy heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse,\r\nAnd all my powers do their bestowing lose,\r\nLike vassalage at unawares encount’ring\r\nThe eye of majesty.\r\n\r\n Re-enter Pandarus with Cressida.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nCome, come, what need you blush? Shame’s a baby. Here she is now; swear\r\nthe oaths now to her that you have sworn to me.—What, are you gone\r\nagain? You must be watch’d ere you be made tame, must you? Come your\r\nways, come your ways; and you draw backward, we’ll put you i’ th’\r\nfills. Why do you not speak to her? Come, draw this curtain and let’s\r\nsee your picture. Alas the day, how loath you are to offend daylight!\r\nAnd ’twere dark, you’d close sooner. So, so; rub on, and kiss the\r\nmistress. How now, a kiss in fee-farm! Build there, carpenter; the air\r\nis sweet. Nay, you shall fight your hearts out ere I part you. The\r\nfalcon as the tercel, for all the ducks i’ th’ river. Go to, go to.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nYou have bereft me of all words, lady.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nWords pay no debts, give her deeds; but she’ll bereave you o’ th’ deeds\r\ntoo, if she call your activity in question. What, billing again? Here’s\r\n‘In witness whereof the parties interchangeably.’ Come in, come in;\r\nI’ll go get a fire.\r\n\r\n [_Exit_.]\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nWill you walk in, my lord?\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nO Cressid, how often have I wish’d me thus!\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nWish’d, my lord! The gods grant—O my lord!\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nWhat should they grant? What makes this pretty abruption? What too\r\ncurious dreg espies my sweet lady in the fountain of our love?\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nMore dregs than water, if my fears have eyes.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nFears make devils of cherubins; they never see truly.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nBlind fear, that seeing reason leads, finds safer footing than blind\r\nreason stumbling without fear. To fear the worst oft cures the worse.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nO, let my lady apprehend no fear! In all Cupid’s pageant there is\r\npresented no monster.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nNor nothing monstrous neither?\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nNothing, but our undertakings when we vow to weep seas, live in fire,\r\neat rocks, tame tigers; thinking it harder for our mistress to devise\r\nimposition enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed. This\r\nis the monstruosity in love, lady, that the will is infinite, and the\r\nexecution confin’d; that the desire is boundless, and the act a slave\r\nto limit.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nThey say all lovers swear more performance than they are able, and yet\r\nreserve an ability that they never perform; vowing more than the\r\nperfection of ten, and discharging less than the tenth part of one.\r\nThey that have the voice of lions and the act of hares, are they not\r\nmonsters?\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nAre there such? Such are not we. Praise us as we are tasted, allow us\r\nas we prove; our head shall go bare till merit crown it. No perfection\r\nin reversion shall have a praise in present. We will not name desert\r\nbefore his birth; and, being born, his addition shall be humble. Few\r\nwords to fair faith: Troilus shall be such to Cressid as what envy can\r\nsay worst shall be a mock for his truth; and what truth can speak\r\ntruest not truer than Troilus.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nWill you walk in, my lord?\r\n\r\n Re-enter Pandarus.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nWhat, blushing still? Have you not done talking yet?\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nWell, uncle, what folly I commit, I dedicate to you.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nI thank you for that; if my lord get a boy of you, you’ll give him me.\r\nBe true to my lord; if he flinch, chide me for it.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nYou know now your hostages: your uncle’s word and my firm faith.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nNay, I’ll give my word for her too: our kindred, though they be long\r\nere they are wooed, they are constant being won; they are burs, I can\r\ntell you; they’ll stick where they are thrown.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nBoldness comes to me now and brings me heart.\r\nPrince Troilus, I have lov’d you night and day\r\nFor many weary months.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nWhy was my Cressid then so hard to win?\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nHard to seem won; but I was won, my lord,\r\nWith the first glance that ever—pardon me.\r\nIf I confess much, you will play the tyrant.\r\nI love you now; but till now not so much\r\nBut I might master it. In faith, I lie;\r\nMy thoughts were like unbridled children, grown\r\nToo headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!\r\nWhy have I blabb’d? Who shall be true to us,\r\nWhen we are so unsecret to ourselves?\r\nBut, though I lov’d you well, I woo’d you not;\r\nAnd yet, good faith, I wish’d myself a man,\r\nOr that we women had men’s privilege\r\nOf speaking first. Sweet, bid me hold my tongue,\r\nFor in this rapture I shall surely speak\r\nThe thing I shall repent. See, see, your silence,\r\nCunning in dumbness, from my weakness draws\r\nMy very soul of counsel. Stop my mouth.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nAnd shall, albeit sweet music issues thence.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nPretty, i’ faith.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nMy lord, I do beseech you, pardon me;\r\n’Twas not my purpose thus to beg a kiss.\r\nI am asham’d. O heavens! what have I done?\r\nFor this time will I take my leave, my lord.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nYour leave, sweet Cressid!\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nLeave! And you take leave till tomorrow morning—\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nPray you, content you.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nWhat offends you, lady?\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nSir, mine own company.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nYou cannot shun yourself.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nLet me go and try.\r\nI have a kind of self resides with you;\r\nBut an unkind self, that itself will leave\r\nTo be another’s fool. I would be gone.\r\nWhere is my wit? I know not what I speak.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nWell know they what they speak that speak so wisely.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nPerchance, my lord, I show more craft than love;\r\nAnd fell so roundly to a large confession\r\nTo angle for your thoughts; but you are wise—\r\nOr else you love not; for to be wise and love\r\nExceeds man’s might; that dwells with gods above.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nO that I thought it could be in a woman—\r\nAs, if it can, I will presume in you—\r\nTo feed for aye her lamp and flames of love;\r\nTo keep her constancy in plight and youth,\r\nOutliving beauty’s outward, with a mind\r\nThat doth renew swifter than blood decays!\r\nOr that persuasion could but thus convince me\r\nThat my integrity and truth to you\r\nMight be affronted with the match and weight\r\nOf such a winnowed purity in love.\r\nHow were I then uplifted! But, alas,\r\nI am as true as truth’s simplicity,\r\nAnd simpler than the infancy of truth.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nIn that I’ll war with you.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nO virtuous fight,\r\nWhen right with right wars who shall be most right!\r\nTrue swains in love shall in the world to come\r\nApprove their truth by Troilus, when their rhymes,\r\nFull of protest, of oath, and big compare,\r\nWant similes, truth tir’d with iteration—\r\nAs true as steel, as plantage to the moon,\r\nAs sun to day, as turtle to her mate,\r\nAs iron to adamant, as earth to th’ centre—\r\nYet, after all comparisons of truth,\r\nAs truth’s authentic author to be cited,\r\n‘As true as Troilus’ shall crown up the verse\r\nAnd sanctify the numbers.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nProphet may you be!\r\nIf I be false, or swerve a hair from truth,\r\nWhen time is old and hath forgot itself,\r\nWhen waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy,\r\nAnd blind oblivion swallow’d cities up,\r\nAnd mighty states characterless are grated\r\nTo dusty nothing—yet let memory\r\nFrom false to false, among false maids in love,\r\nUpbraid my falsehood when th’ have said ‘As false\r\nAs air, as water, wind, or sandy earth,\r\nAs fox to lamb, or wolf to heifer’s calf,\r\nPard to the hind, or stepdame to her son’—\r\nYea, let them say, to stick the heart of falsehood,\r\n‘As false as Cressid.’\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nGo to, a bargain made; seal it, seal it; I’ll be the witness. Here I\r\nhold your hand; here my cousin’s. If ever you prove false one to\r\nanother, since I have taken such pains to bring you together, let all\r\npitiful goers-between be call’d to the world’s end after my name—call\r\nthem all Pandars; let all constant men be Troiluses, all false women\r\nCressids, and all brokers between Pandars. Say ‘Amen.’\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nAmen. Whereupon I will show you a chamber and a bed; which bed, because\r\nit shall not speak of your pretty encounters, press it to death. Away!\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Troilus and Cressida_.]\r\n\r\nAnd Cupid grant all tongue-tied maidens here,\r\nBed, chamber, pander, to provide this gear!\r\n\r\n [_Exit_.]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. The Greek camp.\r\n\r\n Flourish. Enter Agamemnon, Ulysses, Diomedes, Nestor, Ajax, Menelaus\r\n and Calchas.\r\n\r\nCALCHAS.\r\nNow, Princes, for the service I have done,\r\nTh’advantage of the time prompts me aloud\r\nTo call for recompense. Appear it to your mind\r\nThat, through the sight I bear in things to come,\r\nI have abandon’d Troy, left my possession,\r\nIncurr’d a traitor’s name, expos’d myself\r\nFrom certain and possess’d conveniences\r\nTo doubtful fortunes, sequest’ring from me all\r\nThat time, acquaintance, custom, and condition,\r\nMade tame and most familiar to my nature;\r\nAnd here, to do you service, am become\r\nAs new into the world, strange, unacquainted—\r\nI do beseech you, as in way of taste,\r\nTo give me now a little benefit\r\nOut of those many regist’red in promise,\r\nWhich you say live to come in my behalf.\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nWhat wouldst thou of us, Trojan? Make demand.\r\n\r\nCALCHAS.\r\nYou have a Trojan prisoner call’d Antenor,\r\nYesterday took; Troy holds him very dear.\r\nOft have you—often have you thanks therefore—\r\nDesir’d my Cressid in right great exchange,\r\nWhom Troy hath still denied; but this Antenor,\r\nI know, is such a wrest in their affairs\r\nThat their negotiations all must slack\r\nWanting his manage; and they will almost\r\nGive us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,\r\nIn change of him. Let him be sent, great Princes,\r\nAnd he shall buy my daughter; and her presence\r\nShall quite strike off all service I have done\r\nIn most accepted pain.\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nLet Diomedes bear him,\r\nAnd bring us Cressid hither. Calchas shall have\r\nWhat he requests of us. Good Diomed,\r\nFurnish you fairly for this interchange;\r\nWithal, bring word if Hector will tomorrow\r\nBe answer’d in his challenge. Ajax is ready.\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nThis shall I undertake; and ’tis a burden\r\nWhich I am proud to bear.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Diomedes and Calchas_.]\r\n\r\n [_Achilles and Patroclus stand in their tent_.]\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nAchilles stands i’ th’entrance of his tent.\r\nPlease it our general pass strangely by him,\r\nAs if he were forgot; and, Princes all,\r\nLay negligent and loose regard upon him.\r\nI will come last. ’Tis like he’ll question me\r\nWhy such unplausive eyes are bent, why turn’d on him.\r\nIf so, I have derision med’cinable\r\nTo use between your strangeness and his pride,\r\nWhich his own will shall have desire to drink.\r\nIt may do good. Pride hath no other glass\r\nTo show itself but pride; for supple knees\r\nFeed arrogance and are the proud man’s fees.\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nWe’ll execute your purpose, and put on\r\nA form of strangeness as we pass along.\r\nSo do each lord; and either greet him not,\r\nOr else disdainfully, which shall shake him more\r\nThan if not look’d on. I will lead the way.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nWhat comes the general to speak with me?\r\nYou know my mind. I’ll fight no more ’gainst Troy.\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nWhat says Achilles? Would he aught with us?\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\nWould you, my lord, aught with the general?\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\nNothing, my lord.\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nThe better.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Agamemnon and Nestor_.]\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nGood day, good day.\r\n\r\nMENELAUS.\r\nHow do you? How do you?\r\n\r\n [_Exit_.]\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nWhat, does the cuckold scorn me?\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nHow now, Patroclus?\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nGood morrow, Ajax.\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nHa?\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nGood morrow.\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nAy, and good next day too.\r\n\r\n [_Exit_.]\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nWhat mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nThey pass by strangely. They were us’d to bend,\r\nTo send their smiles before them to Achilles,\r\nTo come as humbly as they us’d to creep\r\nTo holy altars.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nWhat, am I poor of late?\r\n’Tis certain, greatness, once fall’n out with fortune,\r\nMust fall out with men too. What the declin’d is,\r\nHe shall as soon read in the eyes of others\r\nAs feel in his own fall; for men, like butterflies,\r\nShow not their mealy wings but to the summer;\r\nAnd not a man for being simply man\r\nHath any honour, but honour for those honours\r\nThat are without him, as place, riches, and favour,\r\nPrizes of accident, as oft as merit;\r\nWhich when they fall, as being slippery standers,\r\nThe love that lean’d on them as slippery too,\r\nDoth one pluck down another, and together\r\nDie in the fall. But ’tis not so with me:\r\nFortune and I are friends; I do enjoy\r\nAt ample point all that I did possess\r\nSave these men’s looks; who do, methinks, find out\r\nSomething not worth in me such rich beholding\r\nAs they have often given. Here is Ulysses.\r\nI’ll interrupt his reading.\r\nHow now, Ulysses!\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nNow, great Thetis’ son!\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nWhat are you reading?\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nA strange fellow here\r\nWrites me that man—how dearly ever parted,\r\nHow much in having, or without or in—\r\nCannot make boast to have that which he hath,\r\nNor feels not what he owes, but by reflection;\r\nAs when his virtues shining upon others\r\nHeat them, and they retort that heat again\r\nTo the first giver.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nThis is not strange, Ulysses.\r\nThe beauty that is borne here in the face\r\nThe bearer knows not, but commends itself\r\nTo others’ eyes; nor doth the eye itself—\r\nThat most pure spirit of sense—behold itself,\r\nNot going from itself; but eye to eye opposed\r\nSalutes each other with each other’s form;\r\nFor speculation turns not to itself\r\nTill it hath travell’d, and is mirror’d there\r\nWhere it may see itself. This is not strange at all.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nI do not strain at the position—\r\nIt is familiar—but at the author’s drift;\r\nWho, in his circumstance, expressly proves\r\nThat no man is the lord of anything,\r\nThough in and of him there be much consisting,\r\nTill he communicate his parts to others;\r\nNor doth he of himself know them for aught\r\nTill he behold them formed in the applause\r\nWhere th’are extended; who, like an arch, reverb’rate\r\nThe voice again; or, like a gate of steel\r\nFronting the sun, receives and renders back\r\nHis figure and his heat. I was much rapt in this;\r\nAnd apprehended here immediately\r\nTh’unknown Ajax. Heavens, what a man is there!\r\nA very horse that has he knows not what!\r\nNature, what things there are\r\nMost abject in regard and dear in use!\r\nWhat things again most dear in the esteem\r\nAnd poor in worth! Now shall we see tomorrow—\r\nAn act that very chance doth throw upon him—\r\nAjax renown’d. O heavens, what some men do,\r\nWhile some men leave to do!\r\nHow some men creep in skittish Fortune’s hall,\r\nWhiles others play the idiots in her eyes!\r\nHow one man eats into another’s pride,\r\nWhile pride is fasting in his wantonness!\r\nTo see these Grecian lords!—why, even already\r\nThey clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,\r\nAs if his foot were on brave Hector’s breast,\r\nAnd great Troy shrieking.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nI do believe it; for they pass’d by me\r\nAs misers do by beggars, neither gave to me\r\nGood word nor look. What, are my deeds forgot?\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nTime hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,\r\nWherein he puts alms for oblivion,\r\nA great-siz’d monster of ingratitudes.\r\nThose scraps are good deeds past, which are devour’d\r\nAs fast as they are made, forgot as soon\r\nAs done. Perseverance, dear my lord,\r\nKeeps honour bright. To have done is to hang\r\nQuite out of fashion, like a rusty mail\r\nIn monumental mock’ry. Take the instant way;\r\nFor honour travels in a strait so narrow—\r\nWhere one but goes abreast. Keep then the path,\r\nFor emulation hath a thousand sons\r\nThat one by one pursue; if you give way,\r\nOr hedge aside from the direct forthright,\r\nLike to an ent’red tide they all rush by\r\nAnd leave you hindmost;\r\nOr, like a gallant horse fall’n in first rank,\r\nLie there for pavement to the abject rear,\r\nO’er-run and trampled on. Then what they do in present,\r\nThough less than yours in past, must o’ertop yours;\r\nFor Time is like a fashionable host,\r\nThat slightly shakes his parting guest by th’hand;\r\nAnd with his arms out-stretch’d, as he would fly,\r\nGrasps in the comer. The welcome ever smiles,\r\nAnd farewell goes out sighing. O, let not virtue seek\r\nRemuneration for the thing it was;\r\nFor beauty, wit,\r\nHigh birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,\r\nLove, friendship, charity, are subjects all\r\nTo envious and calumniating Time.\r\nOne touch of nature makes the whole world kin—\r\nThat all with one consent praise new-born gauds,\r\nThough they are made and moulded of things past,\r\nAnd give to dust that is a little gilt\r\nMore laud than gilt o’er-dusted.\r\nThe present eye praises the present object.\r\nThen marvel not, thou great and complete man,\r\nThat all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax,\r\nSince things in motion sooner catch the eye\r\nThan what stirs not. The cry went once on thee,\r\nAnd still it might, and yet it may again,\r\nIf thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive\r\nAnd case thy reputation in thy tent,\r\nWhose glorious deeds but in these fields of late\r\nMade emulous missions ’mongst the gods themselves,\r\nAnd drave great Mars to faction.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nOf this my privacy\r\nI have strong reasons.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nBut ’gainst your privacy\r\nThe reasons are more potent and heroical.\r\n’Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love\r\nWith one of Priam’s daughters.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nHa! known!\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nIs that a wonder?\r\nThe providence that’s in a watchful state\r\nKnows almost every grain of Plutus’ gold;\r\nFinds bottom in th’uncomprehensive deeps;\r\nKeeps place with thought, and almost, like the gods,\r\nDo thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.\r\nThere is a mystery—with whom relation\r\nDurst never meddle—in the soul of state,\r\nWhich hath an operation more divine\r\nThan breath or pen can give expressure to.\r\nAll the commerce that you have had with Troy\r\nAs perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;\r\nAnd better would it fit Achilles much\r\nTo throw down Hector than Polyxena.\r\nBut it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,\r\nWhen fame shall in our island sound her trump,\r\nAnd all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing\r\n‘Great Hector’s sister did Achilles win;\r\nBut our great Ajax bravely beat down him.’\r\nFarewell, my lord. I as your lover speak.\r\nThe fool slides o’er the ice that you should break.\r\n\r\n [_Exit_.]\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nTo this effect, Achilles, have I mov’d you.\r\nA woman impudent and mannish grown\r\nIs not more loath’d than an effeminate man\r\nIn time of action. I stand condemn’d for this;\r\nThey think my little stomach to the war\r\nAnd your great love to me restrains you thus.\r\nSweet, rouse yourself; and the weak wanton Cupid\r\nShall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,\r\nAnd, like a dew-drop from the lion’s mane,\r\nBe shook to air.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nShall Ajax fight with Hector?\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nAy, and perhaps receive much honour by him.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nI see my reputation is at stake;\r\nMy fame is shrewdly gor’d.\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nO, then, beware:\r\nThose wounds heal ill that men do give themselves;\r\nOmission to do what is necessary\r\nSeals a commission to a blank of danger;\r\nAnd danger, like an ague, subtly taints\r\nEven then when they sit idly in the sun.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nGo call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus.\r\nI’ll send the fool to Ajax, and desire him\r\nT’invite the Trojan lords, after the combat,\r\nTo see us here unarm’d. I have a woman’s longing,\r\nAn appetite that I am sick withal,\r\nTo see great Hector in his weeds of peace;\r\nTo talk with him, and to behold his visage,\r\nEven to my full of view.\r\n\r\n Enter Thersites.\r\n\r\nA labour sav’d!\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nA wonder!\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nWhat?\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nAjax goes up and down the field asking for himself.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nHow so?\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nHe must fight singly tomorrow with Hector, and is so prophetically\r\nproud of an heroical cudgelling that he raves in saying nothing.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nHow can that be?\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nWhy, a’ stalks up and down like a peacock—a stride and a stand;\r\nruminates like an hostess that hath no arithmetic but her brain to set\r\ndown her reckoning, bites his lip with a politic regard, as who should\r\nsay ‘There were wit in this head, and ’twould out’; and so there is;\r\nbut it lies as coldly in him as fire in a flint, which will not show\r\nwithout knocking. The man’s undone for ever; for if Hector break not\r\nhis neck i’ th’ combat, he’ll break’t himself in vainglory. He knows\r\nnot me. I said ‘Good morrow, Ajax’; and he replies ‘Thanks, Agamemnon.’\r\nWhat think you of this man that takes me for the general? He’s grown a\r\nvery land fish, languageless, a monster. A plague of opinion! A man may\r\nwear it on both sides, like leather jerkin.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nThou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites.\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nWho, I? Why, he’ll answer nobody; he professes not answering. Speaking\r\nis for beggars: he wears his tongue in’s arms. I will put on his\r\npresence. Let Patroclus make his demands to me, you shall see the\r\npageant of Ajax.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nTo him, Patroclus. Tell him I humbly desire the valiant Ajax to invite\r\nthe most valorous Hector to come unarm’d to my tent; and to procure\r\nsafe conduct for his person of the magnanimous and most illustrious\r\nsix-or-seven-times-honour’d Captain General of the Grecian army,\r\nAgamemnon. Do this.\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nJove bless great Ajax!\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nHum!\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nI come from the worthy Achilles—\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nHa!\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nWho most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his tent—\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nHum!\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nAnd to procure safe conduct from Agamemnon.\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nAgamemnon?\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nAy, my lord.\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nHa!\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nWhat you say to’t?\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nGod buy you, with all my heart.\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nYour answer, sir.\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nIf tomorrow be a fair day, by eleven of the clock it will go one way or\r\nother. Howsoever, he shall pay for me ere he has me.\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nYour answer, sir.\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nFare ye well, with all my heart.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nWhy, but he is not in this tune, is he?\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nNo, but out of tune thus. What music will be in him when Hector has\r\nknock’d out his brains, I know not; but, I am sure, none; unless the\r\nfiddler Apollo get his sinews to make catlings on.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nCome, thou shalt bear a letter to him straight.\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nLet me bear another to his horse; for that’s the more capable creature.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nMy mind is troubled, like a fountain stirr’d;\r\nAnd I myself see not the bottom of it.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Achilles and Patroclus_.]\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nWould the fountain of your mind were clear again, that I might water an\r\nass at it. I had rather be a tick in a sheep than such a valiant\r\nignorance.\r\n\r\n [_Exit_.]\r\n\nACT IV\r\n\r\nSCENE I. Troy. A street.\r\n\n Enter, at one side, Aeneas and servant with a torch; at another Paris,\r\n Deiphobus, Antenor, Diomedes the Grecian, and others, with torches.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nSee, ho! Who is that there?\r\n\r\nDEIPHOBUS.\r\nIt is the Lord Aeneas.\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nIs the Prince there in person?\r\nHad I so good occasion to lie long\r\nAs you, Prince Paris, nothing but heavenly business\r\nShould rob my bed-mate of my company.\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nThat’s my mind too. Good morrow, Lord Aeneas.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nA valiant Greek, Aeneas—take his hand:\r\nWitness the process of your speech, wherein\r\nYou told how Diomed, a whole week by days,\r\nDid haunt you in the field.\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nHealth to you, valiant sir,\r\nDuring all question of the gentle truce;\r\nBut when I meet you arm’d, as black defiance\r\nAs heart can think or courage execute.\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nThe one and other Diomed embraces.\r\nOur bloods are now in calm; and so long health!\r\nBut when contention and occasion meet,\r\nBy Jove, I’ll play the hunter for thy life\r\nWith all my force, pursuit, and policy.\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nAnd thou shalt hunt a lion that will fly\r\nWith his face backward. In humane gentleness,\r\nWelcome to Troy! Now, by Anchises’ life,\r\nWelcome indeed! By Venus’ hand I swear\r\nNo man alive can love in such a sort\r\nThe thing he means to kill, more excellently.\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nWe sympathise. Jove let Aeneas live,\r\nIf to my sword his fate be not the glory,\r\nA thousand complete courses of the sun!\r\nBut in mine emulous honour let him die\r\nWith every joint a wound, and that tomorrow!\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nWe know each other well.\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nWe do; and long to know each other worse.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nThis is the most despiteful gentle greeting,\r\nThe noblest hateful love, that e’er I heard of.\r\nWhat business, lord, so early?\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nI was sent for to the King; but why, I know not.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nHis purpose meets you: ’twas to bring this Greek\r\nTo Calchas’ house, and there to render him,\r\nFor the enfreed Antenor, the fair Cressid.\r\nLet’s have your company; or, if you please,\r\nHaste there before us. I constantly believe—\r\nOr rather call my thought a certain knowledge—\r\nMy brother Troilus lodges there tonight.\r\nRouse him and give him note of our approach,\r\nWith the whole quality wherefore; I fear\r\nWe shall be much unwelcome.\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nThat I assure you:\r\nTroilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece\r\nThan Cressid borne from Troy.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nThere is no help;\r\nThe bitter disposition of the time\r\nWill have it so. On, lord; we’ll follow you.\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nGood morrow, all.\r\n\r\n [_Exit with servant_.]\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nAnd tell me, noble Diomed, faith, tell me true,\r\nEven in the soul of sound good-fellowship,\r\nWho in your thoughts deserves fair Helen best,\r\nMyself, or Menelaus?\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nBoth alike:\r\nHe merits well to have her that doth seek her,\r\nNot making any scruple of her soilure,\r\nWith such a hell of pain and world of charge;\r\nAnd you as well to keep her that defend her,\r\nNot palating the taste of her dishonour,\r\nWith such a costly loss of wealth and friends.\r\nHe like a puling cuckold would drink up\r\nThe lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece;\r\nYou, like a lecher, out of whorish loins\r\nAre pleas’d to breed out your inheritors.\r\nBoth merits pois’d, each weighs nor less nor more,\r\nBut he as he, the heavier for a whore.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nYou are too bitter to your country-woman.\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nShe’s bitter to her country. Hear me, Paris:\r\nFor every false drop in her bawdy veins\r\nA Grecian’s life hath sunk; for every scruple\r\nOf her contaminated carrion weight\r\nA Trojan hath been slain. Since she could speak,\r\nShe hath not given so many good words breath\r\nAs for her Greeks and Trojans suff’red death.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nFair Diomed, you do as chapmen do,\r\nDispraise the thing that you desire to buy;\r\nBut we in silence hold this virtue well,\r\nWe’ll not commend what we intend to sell.\r\nHere lies our way.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt_.]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. Troy. The court of Pandarus’ house.\r\n\r\n Enter Troilus and Cressida.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nDear, trouble not yourself; the morn is cold.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nThen, sweet my lord, I’ll call mine uncle down;\r\nHe shall unbolt the gates.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nTrouble him not;\r\nTo bed, to bed! Sleep kill those pretty eyes,\r\nAnd give as soft attachment to thy senses\r\nAs infants empty of all thought!\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nGood morrow, then.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nI prithee now, to bed.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nAre you aweary of me?\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nO Cressida! but that the busy day,\r\nWak’d by the lark, hath rous’d the ribald crows,\r\nAnd dreaming night will hide our joys no longer,\r\nI would not from thee.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nNight hath been too brief.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nBeshrew the witch! with venomous wights she stays\r\nAs tediously as hell, but flies the grasps of love\r\nWith wings more momentary-swift than thought.\r\nYou will catch cold, and curse me.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nPrithee tarry.\r\nYou men will never tarry.\r\nO foolish Cressid! I might have still held off,\r\nAnd then you would have tarried. Hark! there’s one up.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\n[_Within._] What’s all the doors open here?\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nIt is your uncle.\r\n\r\n Enter Pandarus.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nA pestilence on him! Now will he be mocking.\r\nI shall have such a life!\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nHow now, how now! How go maidenheads?\r\nHere, you maid! Where’s my cousin Cressid?\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nGo hang yourself, you naughty mocking uncle.\r\nYou bring me to do, and then you flout me too.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nTo do what? to do what? Let her say what.\r\nWhat have I brought you to do?\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nCome, come, beshrew your heart! You’ll ne’er be good, nor suffer\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nHa, ha! Alas, poor wretch! Ah, poor capocchia! Hast not slept tonight?\r\nWould he not, a naughty man, let it sleep? A bugbear take him!\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nDid not I tell you? Would he were knock’d i’ th’ head!\r\n\r\n [_One knocks_.]\r\n\r\nWho’s that at door? Good uncle, go and see.\r\nMy lord, come you again into my chamber.\r\nYou smile and mock me, as if I meant naughtily.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nHa! ha!\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nCome, you are deceiv’d, I think of no such thing.\r\n\r\n [_Knock_.]\r\n\r\nHow earnestly they knock! Pray you come in:\r\nI would not for half Troy have you seen here.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Troilus and Cressida_.]\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nWho’s there? What’s the matter? Will you beat down the door? How now?\r\nWhat’s the matter?\r\n\r\n Enter Aeneas.\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nGood morrow, lord, good morrow.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nWho’s there? My lord Aeneas? By my troth,\r\nI knew you not. What news with you so early?\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nIs not Prince Troilus here?\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nHere! What should he do here?\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nCome, he is here, my lord; do not deny him.\r\nIt doth import him much to speak with me.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nIs he here, say you? It’s more than I know, I’ll be sworn. For my own\r\npart, I came in late. What should he do here?\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nWho, nay then! Come, come, you’ll do him wrong ere you are ware; you’ll\r\nbe so true to him to be false to him. Do not you know of him, but yet\r\ngo fetch him hither; go.\r\n\r\n Re-enter Troilus.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nHow now! What’s the matter?\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nMy lord, I scarce have leisure to salute you,\r\nMy matter is so rash. There is at hand\r\nParis your brother, and Deiphobus,\r\nThe Grecian Diomed, and our Antenor\r\nDeliver’d to us; and for him forthwith,\r\nEre the first sacrifice, within this hour,\r\nWe must give up to Diomedes’ hand\r\nThe Lady Cressida.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nIs it so concluded?\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nBy Priam and the general state of Troy.\r\nThey are at hand, and ready to effect it.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nHow my achievements mock me!\r\nI will go meet them; and, my Lord Aeneas,\r\nWe met by chance; you did not find me here.\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nGood, good, my lord, the secrets of neighbour Pandar\r\nHave not more gift in taciturnity.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Troilus and Aeneas_.]\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nIs’t possible? No sooner got but lost? The devil take Antenor! The\r\nyoung prince will go mad. A plague upon Antenor! I would they had\r\nbroke’s neck.\r\n\r\n Re-enter Cressida.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nHow now! What’s the matter? Who was here?\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nAh, ah!\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nWhy sigh you so profoundly? Where’s my lord? Gone? Tell me, sweet\r\nuncle, what’s the matter?\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nWould I were as deep under the earth as I am above!\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nO the gods! What’s the matter?\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nPray thee get thee in. Would thou hadst ne’er been born! I knew thou\r\nwouldst be his death! O, poor gentleman! A plague upon Antenor!\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nGood uncle, I beseech you, on my knees I beseech you, what’s the\r\nmatter?\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nThou must be gone, wench, thou must be gone; thou art chang’d for\r\nAntenor; thou must to thy father, and be gone from Troilus. ’Twill be\r\nhis death; ’twill be his bane; he cannot bear it.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nO you immortal gods! I will not go.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nThou must.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nI will not, uncle. I have forgot my father;\r\nI know no touch of consanguinity,\r\nNo kin, no love, no blood, no soul so near me\r\nAs the sweet Troilus. O you gods divine,\r\nMake Cressid’s name the very crown of falsehood,\r\nIf ever she leave Troilus! Time, force, and death,\r\nDo to this body what extremes you can,\r\nBut the strong base and building of my love\r\nIs as the very centre of the earth,\r\nDrawing all things to it. I’ll go in and weep—\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nDo, do.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nTear my bright hair, and scratch my praised cheeks,\r\nCrack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart,\r\nWith sounding ‘Troilus.’ I will not go from Troy.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt_.]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. Troy. A street before Pandarus’ house.\r\n\r\n Enter Paris, Troilus, Aeneas, Deiphobus, Antenor and Diomedes.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nIt is great morning; and the hour prefix’d\r\nFor her delivery to this valiant Greek\r\nComes fast upon. Good my brother Troilus,\r\nTell you the lady what she is to do\r\nAnd haste her to the purpose.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nWalk into her house.\r\nI’ll bring her to the Grecian presently;\r\nAnd to his hand when I deliver her,\r\nThink it an altar, and thy brother Troilus\r\nA priest, there off’ring to it his own heart.\r\n\r\n [_Exit_.]\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nI know what ’tis to love,\r\nAnd would, as I shall pity, I could help!\r\nPlease you walk in, my lords?\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt_.]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV. Troy. Pandarus’ house.\r\n\r\n Enter Pandarus and Cressida.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nBe moderate, be moderate.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nWhy tell you me of moderation?\r\nThe grief is fine, full, perfect, that I taste,\r\nAnd violenteth in a sense as strong\r\nAs that which causeth it. How can I moderate it?\r\nIf I could temporize with my affections\r\nOr brew it to a weak and colder palate,\r\nThe like allayment could I give my grief.\r\nMy love admits no qualifying dross;\r\nNo more my grief, in such a precious loss.\r\n\r\n Enter Troilus.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nHere, here, here he comes. Ah, sweet ducks!\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\n[_Embracing him_.] O Troilus! Troilus!\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nWhat a pair of spectacles is here! Let me embrace too. ‘O heart,’ as\r\nthe goodly saying is,—\r\n\r\n O heart, heavy heart,\r\n Why sigh’st thou without breaking?\r\n\r\nwhere he answers again\r\n\r\n Because thou canst not ease thy smart\r\n By friendship nor by speaking.\r\n\r\nThere was never a truer rhyme. Let us cast away nothing, for we may\r\nlive to have need of such a verse. We see it, we see it. How now,\r\nlambs!\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nCressid, I love thee in so strain’d a purity\r\nThat the bless’d gods, as angry with my fancy,\r\nMore bright in zeal than the devotion which\r\nCold lips blow to their deities, take thee from me.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nHave the gods envy?\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nAy, ay, ay, ay; ’tis too plain a case.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nAnd is it true that I must go from Troy?\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nA hateful truth.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nWhat! and from Troilus too?\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nFrom Troy and Troilus.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nIs’t possible?\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nAnd suddenly; where injury of chance\r\nPuts back leave-taking, justles roughly by\r\nAll time of pause, rudely beguiles our lips\r\nOf all rejoindure, forcibly prevents\r\nOur lock’d embrasures, strangles our dear vows\r\nEven in the birth of our own labouring breath.\r\nWe two, that with so many thousand sighs\r\nDid buy each other, must poorly sell ourselves\r\nWith the rude brevity and discharge of one.\r\nInjurious time now with a robber’s haste\r\nCrams his rich thiev’ry up, he knows not how.\r\nAs many farewells as be stars in heaven,\r\nWith distinct breath and consign’d kisses to them,\r\nHe fumbles up into a loose adieu,\r\nAnd scants us with a single famish’d kiss,\r\nDistasted with the salt of broken tears.\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\n[_Within_.] My lord, is the lady ready?\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nHark! you are call’d. Some say the Genius\r\nCries so to him that instantly must die.\r\nBid them have patience; she shall come anon.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nWhere are my tears? Rain, to lay this wind, or my heart will be blown\r\nup by my throat!\r\n\r\n [_Exit_.]\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nI must then to the Grecians?\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nNo remedy.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nA woeful Cressid ’mongst the merry Greeks!\r\nWhen shall we see again?\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nHear me, my love. Be thou but true of heart.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nI true? How now! What wicked deem is this?\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nNay, we must use expostulation kindly,\r\nFor it is parting from us.\r\nI speak not ‘Be thou true’ as fearing thee,\r\nFor I will throw my glove to Death himself\r\nThat there’s no maculation in thy heart;\r\nBut ‘Be thou true’ say I to fashion in\r\nMy sequent protestation: be thou true,\r\nAnd I will see thee.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nO! you shall be expos’d, my lord, to dangers\r\nAs infinite as imminent! But I’ll be true.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nAnd I’ll grow friend with danger. Wear this sleeve.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nAnd you this glove. When shall I see you?\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nI will corrupt the Grecian sentinels\r\nTo give thee nightly visitation.\r\nBut yet be true.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nO heavens! ‘Be true’ again!\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nHear why I speak it, love.\r\nThe Grecian youths are full of quality;\r\nThey’re loving, well compos’d, with gifts of nature,\r\nFlowing and swelling o’er with arts and exercise.\r\nHow novelty may move, and parts with person,\r\nAlas, a kind of godly jealousy,\r\nWhich, I beseech you, call a virtuous sin,\r\nMakes me afear’d.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nO heavens! you love me not!\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nDie I a villain then!\r\nIn this I do not call your faith in question\r\nSo mainly as my merit. I cannot sing,\r\nNor heel the high lavolt, nor sweeten talk,\r\nNor play at subtle games; fair virtues all,\r\nTo which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant;\r\nBut I can tell that in each grace of these\r\nThere lurks a still and dumb-discoursive devil\r\nThat tempts most cunningly. But be not tempted.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nDo you think I will?\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nNo.\r\nBut something may be done that we will not;\r\nAnd sometimes we are devils to ourselves,\r\nWhen we will tempt the frailty of our powers,\r\nPresuming on their changeful potency.\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\n[_Within_.] Nay, good my lord!\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nCome, kiss; and let us part.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\n[_Within_.] Brother Troilus!\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nGood brother, come you hither;\r\nAnd bring Aeneas and the Grecian with you.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nMy lord, will you be true?\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nWho, I? Alas, it is my vice, my fault!\r\nWhiles others fish with craft for great opinion,\r\nI with great truth catch mere simplicity;\r\nWhilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns,\r\nWith truth and plainness I do wear mine bare.\r\nFear not my truth: the moral of my wit\r\nIs plain and true; there’s all the reach of it.\r\n\r\n Enter Aeneas, Paris, Antenor, Deiphobus and Diomedes.\r\n\r\nWelcome, Sir Diomed! Here is the lady\r\nWhich for Antenor we deliver you;\r\nAt the port, lord, I’ll give her to thy hand,\r\nAnd by the way possess thee what she is.\r\nEntreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,\r\nIf e’er thou stand at mercy of my sword,\r\nName Cressid, and thy life shall be as safe\r\nAs Priam is in Ilion.\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nFair Lady Cressid,\r\nSo please you, save the thanks this prince expects.\r\nThe lustre in your eye, heaven in your cheek,\r\nPleads your fair usage; and to Diomed\r\nYou shall be mistress, and command him wholly.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nGrecian, thou dost not use me courteously\r\nTo shame the zeal of my petition to thee\r\nIn praising her. I tell thee, lord of Greece,\r\nShe is as far high-soaring o’er thy praises\r\nAs thou unworthy to be call’d her servant.\r\nI charge thee use her well, even for my charge;\r\nFor, by the dreadful Pluto, if thou dost not,\r\nThough the great bulk Achilles be thy guard,\r\nI’ll cut thy throat.\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nO, be not mov’d, Prince Troilus.\r\nLet me be privileg’d by my place and message\r\nTo be a speaker free: when I am hence\r\nI’ll answer to my lust. And know you, lord,\r\nI’ll nothing do on charge: to her own worth\r\nShe shall be priz’d. But that you say ‘Be’t so,’\r\nI speak it in my spirit and honour, ‘No.’\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nCome, to the port. I’ll tell thee, Diomed,\r\nThis brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head.\r\nLady, give me your hand; and, as we walk,\r\nTo our own selves bend we our needful talk.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Troilus, Cressida and Diomedes_.]\r\n\r\n [_Sound trumpet_.]\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nHark! Hector’s trumpet.\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nHow have we spent this morning!\r\nThe Prince must think me tardy and remiss,\r\nThat swore to ride before him to the field.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\n’Tis Troilus’ fault. Come, come to field with him.\r\n\r\nDEIPHOBUS.\r\nLet us make ready straight.\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nYea, with a bridegroom’s fresh alacrity\r\nLet us address to tend on Hector’s heels.\r\nThe glory of our Troy doth this day lie\r\nOn his fair worth and single chivalry.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt_.]\r\n\r\nSCENE V.

That spirit of his\r\nIn aspiration lifts him from the earth.\r\n\r\n Enter Diomedes and Cressida.\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nIs this the Lady Cressid?\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nEven she.\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nMost dearly welcome to the Greeks, sweet lady.\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\nOur general doth salute you with a kiss.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nYet is the kindness but particular;\r\n’Twere better she were kiss’d in general.\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\nAnd very courtly counsel: I’ll begin.\r\nSo much for Nestor.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nI’ll take that winter from your lips, fair lady.\r\nAchilles bids you welcome.\r\n\r\nMENELAUS.\r\nI had good argument for kissing once.\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nBut that’s no argument for kissing now;\r\nFor thus popp’d Paris in his hardiment,\r\nAnd parted thus you and your argument.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nO deadly gall, and theme of all our scorns!\r\nFor which we lose our heads to gild his horns.\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nThe first was Menelaus’ kiss; this, mine:\r\nPatroclus kisses you.\r\n\r\nMENELAUS.\r\nO, this is trim!\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nParis and I kiss evermore for him.\r\n\r\nMENELAUS.\r\nI’ll have my kiss, sir.

I’ll bring you to your father.\r\n\r\n [_Exit with_ Cressida.]\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\nA woman of quick sense.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nFie, fie upon her!\r\nThere’s language in her eye, her cheek, her lip,\r\nNay, her foot speaks; her wanton spirits look out\r\nAt every joint and motive of her body.\r\nO! these encounterers so glib of tongue\r\nThat give a coasting welcome ere it comes,\r\nAnd wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts\r\nTo every tickling reader! Set them down\r\nFor sluttish spoils of opportunity,\r\nAnd daughters of the game.\r\n\r\n [_Trumpet within_.]\r\n\r\nALL.\r\nThe Trojans’ trumpet.\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nYonder comes the troop.\r\n\r\n Enter Hector, armed; Aeneas, Troilus, Paris, Deiphobus and other\r\nTrojans, with attendants.\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nHail, all you state of Greece! What shall be done\r\nTo him that victory commands? Or do you purpose\r\nA victor shall be known? Will you the knights\r\nShall to the edge of all extremity\r\nPursue each other, or shall be divided\r\nBy any voice or order of the field?\r\nHector bade ask.\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nWhich way would Hector have it?\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nHe cares not; he’ll obey conditions.\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\n’Tis done like Hector.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nBut securely done,\r\nA little proudly, and great deal misprising\r\nThe knight oppos’d.\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nIf not Achilles, sir,\r\nWhat is your name?\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nIf not Achilles, nothing.\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nTherefore Achilles. But whate’er, know this:\r\nIn the extremity of great and little\r\nValour and pride excel themselves in Hector;\r\nThe one almost as infinite as all,\r\nThe other blank as nothing. Weigh him well,\r\nAnd that which looks like pride is courtesy.\r\nThis Ajax is half made of Hector’s blood;\r\nIn love whereof half Hector stays at home;\r\nHalf heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seek\r\nThis blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nA maiden battle then? O! I perceive you.\r\n\r\n Re-enter Diomedes.\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nHere is Sir Diomed. Go, gentle knight,\r\nStand by our Ajax. As you and Lord Aeneas\r\nConsent upon the order of their fight,\r\nSo be it; either to the uttermost,\r\nOr else a breath. The combatants being kin\r\nHalf stints their strife before their strokes begin.\r\n\r\nAjax and Hector enter the lists.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nThey are oppos’d already.\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nWhat Trojan is that same that looks so heavy?\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nThe youngest son of Priam, a true knight;\r\nNot yet mature, yet matchless; firm of word;\r\nSpeaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue;\r\nNot soon provok’d, nor being provok’d soon calm’d;\r\nHis heart and hand both open and both free;\r\nFor what he has he gives, what thinks he shows,\r\nYet gives he not till judgement guide his bounty,\r\nNor dignifies an impure thought with breath;\r\nManly as Hector, but more dangerous;\r\nFor Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes\r\nTo tender objects, but he in heat of action\r\nIs more vindicative than jealous love.\r\nThey call him Troilus, and on him erect\r\nA second hope as fairly built as Hector.\r\nThus says Aeneas, one that knows the youth\r\nEven to his inches, and, with private soul,\r\nDid in great Ilion thus translate him to me.\r\n\r\n [_Alarum. Hector and Ajax fight._]\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nThey are in action.\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\nNow, Ajax, hold thine own!\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nHector, thou sleep’st; awake thee!\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nHis blows are well dispos’d.

Let me embrace thee, Ajax.\r\nBy him that thunders, thou hast lusty arms;\r\nHector would have them fall upon him thus.\r\nCousin, all honour to thee!\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nI thank thee, Hector.\r\nThou art too gentle and too free a man.\r\nI came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence\r\nA great addition earned in thy death.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nNot Neoptolemus so mirable,\r\nOn whose bright crest Fame with her loud’st Oyes\r\nCries ‘This is he!’ could promise to himself\r\nA thought of added honour torn from Hector.\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nThere is expectance here from both the sides\r\nWhat further you will do.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nWe’ll answer it:\r\nThe issue is embracement. Ajax, farewell.\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nIf I might in entreaties find success,\r\nAs seld’ I have the chance, I would desire\r\nMy famous cousin to our Grecian tents.\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\n’Tis Agamemnon’s wish; and great Achilles\r\nDoth long to see unarm’d the valiant Hector.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nAeneas, call my brother Troilus to me,\r\nAnd signify this loving interview\r\nTo the expecters of our Trojan part;\r\nDesire them home. Give me thy hand, my cousin;\r\nI will go eat with thee, and see your knights.\r\n\r\nAgamemnon and the rest of the Greeks come forward.\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nGreat Agamemnon comes to meet us here.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nThe worthiest of them tell me name by name;\r\nBut for Achilles, my own searching eyes\r\nShall find him by his large and portly size.\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nWorthy all arms! as welcome as to one\r\nThat would be rid of such an enemy.\r\nBut that’s no welcome. Understand more clear,\r\nWhat’s past and what’s to come is strew’d with husks\r\nAnd formless ruin of oblivion;\r\nBut in this extant moment, faith and troth,\r\nStrain’d purely from all hollow bias-drawing,\r\nBids thee with most divine integrity,\r\nFrom heart of very heart, great Hector, welcome.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nI thank thee, most imperious Agamemnon.\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\n[_To Troilus._] My well-fam’d lord of Troy, no less to you.\r\n\r\nMENELAUS.\r\nLet me confirm my princely brother’s greeting.\r\nYou brace of warlike brothers, welcome hither.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nWho must we answer?\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nThe noble Menelaus.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nO you, my lord? By Mars his gauntlet, thanks!\r\nMock not that I affect the untraded oath;\r\nYour quondam wife swears still by Venus’ glove.\r\nShe’s well, but bade me not commend her to you.\r\n\r\nMENELAUS.\r\nName her not now, sir; she’s a deadly theme.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nO, pardon; I offend.\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\nI have, thou gallant Trojan, seen thee oft,\r\nLabouring for destiny, make cruel way\r\nThrough ranks of Greekish youth; and I have seen thee,\r\nAs hot as Perseus, spur thy Phrygian steed,\r\nDespising many forfeits and subduements,\r\nWhen thou hast hung thy advanced sword i’ th’air,\r\nNot letting it decline on the declined;\r\nThat I have said to some my standers-by\r\n‘Lo, Jupiter is yonder, dealing life!’\r\nAnd I have seen thee pause and take thy breath,\r\nWhen that a ring of Greeks have shrap’d thee in,\r\nLike an Olympian wrestling. This have I seen;\r\nBut this thy countenance, still lock’d in steel,\r\nI never saw till now. I knew thy grandsire,\r\nAnd once fought with him. He was a soldier good,\r\nBut, by great Mars, the captain of us all,\r\nNever like thee. O, let an old man embrace thee;\r\nAnd, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents.\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\n’Tis the old Nestor.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nLet me embrace thee, good old chronicle,\r\nThat hast so long walk’d hand in hand with time.\r\nMost reverend Nestor, I am glad to clasp thee.\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\nI would my arms could match thee in contention\r\nAs they contend with thee in courtesy.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nI would they could.\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\nHa!\r\nBy this white beard, I’d fight with thee tomorrow.\r\nWell, welcome, welcome! I have seen the time.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nI wonder now how yonder city stands,\r\nWhen we have here her base and pillar by us.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nI know your favour, Lord Ulysses, well.\r\nAh, sir, there’s many a Greek and Trojan dead,\r\nSince first I saw yourself and Diomed\r\nIn Ilion on your Greekish embassy.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nSir, I foretold you then what would ensue.\r\nMy prophecy is but half his journey yet;\r\nFor yonder walls, that pertly front your town,\r\nYon towers, whose wanton tops do buss the clouds,\r\nMust kiss their own feet.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nI must not believe you.\r\nThere they stand yet; and modestly I think\r\nThe fall of every Phrygian stone will cost\r\nA drop of Grecian blood. The end crowns all;\r\nAnd that old common arbitrator, Time,\r\nWill one day end it.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nSo to him we leave it.\r\nMost gentle and most valiant Hector, welcome.\r\nAfter the General, I beseech you next\r\nTo feast with me and see me at my tent.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nI shall forestall thee, Lord Ulysses, thou!\r\nNow, Hector, I have fed mine eyes on thee;\r\nI have with exact view perus’d thee, Hector,\r\nAnd quoted joint by joint.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nIs this Achilles?\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nI am Achilles.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nStand fair, I pray thee; let me look on thee.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nBehold thy fill.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nNay, I have done already.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nThou art too brief. I will the second time,\r\nAs I would buy thee, view thee limb by limb.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nO, like a book of sport thou’lt read me o’er;\r\nBut there’s more in me than thou understand’st.\r\nWhy dost thou so oppress me with thine eye?\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nTell me, you heavens, in which part of his body\r\nShall I destroy him? Whether there, or there, or there?\r\nThat I may give the local wound a name,\r\nAnd make distinct the very breach whereout\r\nHector’s great spirit flew. Answer me, heavens.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nIt would discredit the blest gods, proud man,\r\nTo answer such a question. Stand again.\r\nThink’st thou to catch my life so pleasantly\r\nAs to prenominate in nice conjecture\r\nWhere thou wilt hit me dead?\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nI tell thee yea.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nWert thou an oracle to tell me so,\r\nI’d not believe thee. Henceforth guard thee well;\r\nFor I’ll not kill thee there, nor there, nor there;\r\nBut, by the forge that stithied Mars his helm,\r\nI’ll kill thee everywhere, yea, o’er and o’er.\r\nYou wisest Grecians, pardon me this brag.\r\nHis insolence draws folly from my lips;\r\nBut I’ll endeavour deeds to match these words,\r\nOr may I never—\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nDo not chafe thee, cousin;\r\nAnd you, Achilles, let these threats alone\r\nTill accident or purpose bring you to’t.\r\nYou may have every day enough of Hector,\r\nIf you have stomach. The general state, I fear,\r\nCan scarce entreat you to be odd with him.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nI pray you let us see you in the field;\r\nWe have had pelting wars since you refus’d\r\nThe Grecians’ cause.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nDost thou entreat me, Hector?\r\nTomorrow do I meet thee, fell as death;\r\nTonight all friends.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nThy hand upon that match.\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nFirst, all you peers of Greece, go to my tent;\r\nThere in the full convive we; afterwards,\r\nAs Hector’s leisure and your bounties shall\r\nConcur together, severally entreat him.\r\nBeat loud the tambourines, let the trumpets blow,\r\nThat this great soldier may his welcome know.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt all but Troilus and Ulysses_.]\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nMy Lord Ulysses, tell me, I beseech you,\r\nIn what place of the field doth Calchas keep?\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nAt Menelaus’ tent, most princely Troilus.\r\nThere Diomed doth feast with him tonight,\r\nWho neither looks upon the heaven nor earth,\r\nBut gives all gaze and bent of amorous view\r\nOn the fair Cressid.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nShall I, sweet lord, be bound to you so much,\r\nAfter we part from Agamemnon’s tent,\r\nTo bring me thither?\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nYou shall command me, sir.\r\nAs gentle tell me of what honour was\r\nThis Cressida in Troy? Had she no lover there\r\nThat wails her absence?\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nO, sir, to such as boasting show their scars\r\nA mock is due. Will you walk on, my lord?\r\nShe was belov’d, she lov’d; she is, and doth;\r\nBut still sweet love is food for fortune’s tooth.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt_.]\r\n\nACT V\r\n\r\nSCENE I. The Grecian camp. Before the tent of Achilles.\r\n\n Enter Achilles and Patroclus.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nI’ll heat his blood with Greekish wine tonight,\r\nWhich with my scimitar I’ll cool tomorrow.\r\nPatroclus, let us feast him to the height.\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nHere comes Thersites.\r\n\r\n Enter Thersites.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nHow now, thou core of envy!\r\nThou crusty batch of nature, what’s the news?\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nWhy, thou picture of what thou seemest, and idol of idiot worshippers,\r\nhere’s a letter for thee.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nFrom whence, fragment?\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nWhy, thou full dish of fool, from Troy.\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nWho keeps the tent now?\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nThe surgeon’s box or the patient’s wound.\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nWell said, adversity! And what needs these tricks?\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nPrithee, be silent, boy; I profit not by thy talk; thou art said to be\r\nAchilles’ male varlet.\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nMale varlet, you rogue! What’s that?\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nWhy, his masculine whore. Now, the rotten diseases of the south, the\r\nguts-griping ruptures, catarrhs, loads o’ gravel in the back,\r\nlethargies, cold palsies, raw eyes, dirt-rotten livers, wheezing lungs,\r\nbladders full of imposthume, sciaticas, lime-kilns i’ th’ palm,\r\nincurable bone-ache, and the rivelled fee-simple of the tetter, take\r\nand take again such preposterous discoveries!\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nWhy, thou damnable box of envy, thou, what meanest thou to curse thus?\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nDo I curse thee?\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nWhy, no, you ruinous butt; you whoreson indistinguishable cur, no.\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nNo! Why art thou, then, exasperate, thou idle immaterial skein of\r\nsleave silk, thou green sarcenet flap for a sore eye, thou tassel of a\r\nprodigal’s purse, thou? Ah, how the poor world is pestered with such\r\nwater-flies, diminutives of nature!\r\n\r\nPATROCLUS.\r\nOut, gall!\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nFinch egg!\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nMy sweet Patroclus, I am thwarted quite\r\nFrom my great purpose in tomorrow’s battle.\r\nHere is a letter from Queen Hecuba,\r\nA token from her daughter, my fair love,\r\nBoth taxing me and gaging me to keep\r\nAn oath that I have sworn. I will not break it.\r\nFall Greeks; fail fame; honour or go or stay;\r\nMy major vow lies here, this I’ll obey.\r\nCome, come, Thersites, help to trim my tent;\r\nThis night in banqueting must all be spent.\r\nAway, Patroclus!\r\n\r\n [_Exit with_ Patroclus.]\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nWith too much blood and too little brain these two may run mad; but, if\r\nwith too much brain and too little blood they do, I’ll be a curer of\r\nmadmen. Here’s Agamemnon, an honest fellow enough, and one that loves\r\nquails, but he has not so much brain as ear-wax; and the goodly\r\ntransformation of Jupiter there, his brother, the bull, the primitive\r\nstatue and oblique memorial of cuckolds, a thrifty shoeing-horn in a\r\nchain at his brother’s leg, to what form but that he is, should wit\r\nlarded with malice, and malice forced with wit, turn him to? To an ass,\r\nwere nothing: he is both ass and ox. To an ox, were nothing: he is both\r\nox and ass. To be a dog, a mule, a cat, a fitchook, a toad, a lizard,\r\nan owl, a puttock, or a herring without a roe, I would not care; but to\r\nbe Menelaus, I would conspire against destiny. Ask me not what I would\r\nbe, if I were not Thersites; for I care not to be the louse of a lazar,\r\nso I were not Menelaus. Hey-day! sprites and fires!\r\n\r\n Enter Hector, Troilus, Ajax, Agamemnon, Ulysses, Nestor, Menelaus and\r\n Diomedes with lights.\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nWe go wrong, we go wrong.\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nNo, yonder ’tis;\r\nThere, where we see the lights.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nI trouble you.\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nNo, not a whit.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nHere comes himself to guide you.\r\n\r\n Re-enter Achilles.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nWelcome, brave Hector; welcome, Princes all.\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nSo now, fair Prince of Troy, I bid good night;\r\nAjax commands the guard to tend on you.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nThanks, and good night to the Greeks’ general.\r\n\r\nMENELAUS.\r\nGood night, my lord.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nGood night, sweet Lord Menelaus.\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nSweet draught! ‘Sweet’ quoth a’!\r\nSweet sink, sweet sewer!\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nGood night and welcome, both at once, to those\r\nThat go or tarry.\r\n\r\nAGAMEMNON.\r\nGood night.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Agamemnon and Menelaus_.]\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nOld Nestor tarries; and you too, Diomed,\r\nKeep Hector company an hour or two.\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nI cannot, lord; I have important business,\r\nThe tide whereof is now. Good night, great Hector.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nGive me your hand.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\n[_Aside to Troilus._] Follow his torch; he goes to\r\nCalchas’ tent; I’ll keep you company.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nSweet sir, you honour me.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nAnd so, good night.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Diomedes, Ulysses and Troilus following._]\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nCome, come, enter my tent.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt all but_ Thersites.]\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nThat same Diomed’s a false-hearted rogue, a most unjust knave; I will\r\nno more trust him when he leers than I will a serpent when he hisses.\r\nHe will spend his mouth and promise, like Brabbler the hound; but when\r\nhe performs, astronomers foretell it: it is prodigious, there will come\r\nsome change; the sun borrows of the moon when Diomed keeps his word. I\r\nwill rather leave to see Hector than not to dog him. They say he keeps\r\na Trojan drab, and uses the traitor Calchas’ tent. I’ll after. Nothing\r\nbut lechery! All incontinent varlets!\r\n\r\n [_Exit_.]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. The Grecian camp. Before Calchas’ tent.\r\n\r\n Enter Diomedes.\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nWhat, are you up here, ho!

Hark, a word with you.\r\n\r\n [_Whispers_.]\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nYea, so familiar?\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nShe will sing any man at first sight.\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nAnd any man may sing her, if he can take her cliff; she’s noted.\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nWill you remember?\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nRemember! Yes.\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nNay, but do, then;\r\nAnd let your mind be coupled with your words.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nWhat should she remember?\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nList!\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nSweet honey Greek, tempt me no more to folly.\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nRoguery!\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nNay, then—\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nI’ll tell you what—\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nFo, fo! come, tell a pin; you are a forsworn.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nIn faith, I cannot. What would you have me do?\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nA juggling trick, to be secretly open.\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nWhat did you swear you would bestow on me?\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nI prithee, do not hold me to mine oath;\r\nBid me do anything but that, sweet Greek.\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nGood night.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nHold, patience!\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nHow now, Trojan!\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nDiomed!\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nNo, no, good night; I’ll be your fool no more.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nThy better must.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nHark! a word in your ear.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nO plague and madness!\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nYou are moved, Prince; let us depart, I pray,\r\nLest your displeasure should enlarge itself\r\nTo wrathful terms. This place is dangerous;\r\nThe time right deadly; I beseech you, go.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nBehold, I pray you.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nNay, good my lord, go off;\r\nYou flow to great distraction; come, my lord.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nI pray thee stay.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nYou have not patience; come.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nI pray you, stay; by hell and all hell’s torments,\r\nI will not speak a word.\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nAnd so, good night.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nNay, but you part in anger.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nDoth that grieve thee?

Stay a little while.\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nHow the devil Luxury, with his fat rump and potato finger, tickles\r\nthese together! Fry, lechery, fry!\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nBut will you, then?\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nIn faith, I will, la; never trust me else.\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nGive me some token for the surety of it.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nI’ll fetch you one.\r\n\r\n [_Exit_.]\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nYou have sworn patience.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nFear me not, my lord;\r\nI will not be myself, nor have cognition\r\nOf what I feel. I am all patience.\r\n\r\n Re-enter Cressida.\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nNow the pledge; now, now, now!\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nHere, Diomed, keep this sleeve.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nO beauty! where is thy faith?\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nMy lord!\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nI will be patient; outwardly I will.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nYou look upon that sleeve; behold it well.\r\nHe lov’d me—O false wench!—Give’t me again.\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nWhose was’t?\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nIt is no matter, now I have’t again.\r\nI will not meet with you tomorrow night.\r\nI prithee, Diomed, visit me no more.\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nNow she sharpens. Well said, whetstone.\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nI shall have it.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nWhat, this?\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nAy, that.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nO all you gods! O pretty, pretty pledge!\r\nThy master now lies thinking on his bed\r\nOf thee and me, and sighs, and takes my glove,\r\nAnd gives memorial dainty kisses to it,\r\nAs I kiss thee. Nay, do not snatch it from me;\r\nHe that takes that doth take my heart withal.\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nI had your heart before; this follows it.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nI did swear patience.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nYou shall not have it, Diomed; faith, you shall not;\r\nI’ll give you something else.\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nI will have this. Whose was it?\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nIt is no matter.\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nCome, tell me whose it was.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\n’Twas one’s that lov’d me better than you will.\r\nBut, now you have it, take it.\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nWhose was it?\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nBy all Diana’s waiting women yond,\r\nAnd by herself, I will not tell you whose.\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nTomorrow will I wear it on my helm,\r\nAnd grieve his spirit that dares not challenge it.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nWert thou the devil and wor’st it on thy horn,\r\nIt should be challeng’d.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nWell, well, ’tis done, ’tis past; and yet it is not;\r\nI will not keep my word.\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nWhy, then farewell;\r\nThou never shalt mock Diomed again.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nYou shall not go.

The hour?\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nAy, come; O Jove! Do come. I shall be plagu’d.\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nFarewell till then.\r\n\r\nCRESSIDA.\r\nGood night. I prithee come.\r\n\r\n [_Exit_ Diomedes.]\r\n\r\nTroilus, farewell! One eye yet looks on thee;\r\nBut with my heart the other eye doth see.\r\nAh, poor our sex! this fault in us I find,\r\nThe error of our eye directs our mind.\r\nWhat error leads must err; O, then conclude,\r\nMinds sway’d by eyes are full of turpitude.\r\n\r\n [_Exit_.]\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nA proof of strength she could not publish more,\r\nUnless she said ‘My mind is now turn’d whore.’\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nAll’s done, my lord.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nIt is.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nWhy stay we, then?\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nTo make a recordation to my soul\r\nOf every syllable that here was spoke.\r\nBut if I tell how these two did co-act,\r\nShall I not lie in publishing a truth?\r\nSith yet there is a credence in my heart,\r\nAn esperance so obstinately strong,\r\nThat doth invert th’attest of eyes and ears;\r\nAs if those organs had deceptious functions\r\nCreated only to calumniate.\r\nWas Cressid here?\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nI cannot conjure, Trojan.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nShe was not, sure.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nMost sure she was.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nWhy, my negation hath no taste of madness.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nNor mine, my lord. Cressid was here but now.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nLet it not be believ’d for womanhood.\r\nThink, we had mothers; do not give advantage\r\nTo stubborn critics, apt, without a theme,\r\nFor depravation, to square the general sex\r\nBy Cressid’s rule. Rather think this not Cressid.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nWhat hath she done, Prince, that can soil our mothers?\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nNothing at all, unless that this were she.\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nWill he swagger himself out on’s own eyes?\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nThis she? No; this is Diomed’s Cressida.\r\nIf beauty have a soul, this is not she;\r\nIf souls guide vows, if vows be sanctimonies,\r\nIf sanctimony be the god’s delight,\r\nIf there be rule in unity itself,\r\nThis was not she. O madness of discourse,\r\nThat cause sets up with and against itself!\r\nBi-fold authority! where reason can revolt\r\nWithout perdition, and loss assume all reason\r\nWithout revolt: this is, and is not, Cressid.\r\nWithin my soul there doth conduce a fight\r\nOf this strange nature, that a thing inseparate\r\nDivides more wider than the sky and earth;\r\nAnd yet the spacious breadth of this division\r\nAdmits no orifice for a point as subtle\r\nAs Ariachne’s broken woof to enter.\r\nInstance, O instance! strong as Pluto’s gates:\r\nCressid is mine, tied with the bonds of heaven.\r\nInstance, O instance! strong as heaven itself:\r\nThe bonds of heaven are slipp’d, dissolv’d, and loos’d;\r\nAnd with another knot, five-finger-tied,\r\nThe fractions of her faith, orts of her love,\r\nThe fragments, scraps, the bits, and greasy relics\r\nOf her o’er-eaten faith, are given to Diomed.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nMay worthy Troilus be half attach’d\r\nWith that which here his passion doth express?\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nAy, Greek; and that shall be divulged well\r\nIn characters as red as Mars his heart\r\nInflam’d with Venus. Never did young man fancy\r\nWith so eternal and so fix’d a soul.\r\nHark, Greek: as much as I do Cressid love,\r\nSo much by weight hate I her Diomed.\r\nThat sleeve is mine that he’ll bear on his helm;\r\nWere it a casque compos’d by Vulcan’s skill\r\nMy sword should bite it. Not the dreadful spout\r\nWhich shipmen do the hurricano call,\r\nConstring’d in mass by the almighty sun,\r\nShall dizzy with more clamour Neptune’s ear\r\nIn his descent than shall my prompted sword\r\nFalling on Diomed.\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nHe’ll tickle it for his concupy.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nO Cressid! O false Cressid! false, false, false!\r\nLet all untruths stand by thy stained name,\r\nAnd they’ll seem glorious.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nO, contain yourself;\r\nYour passion draws ears hither.\r\n\r\n Enter Aeneas.\r\n\r\nAENEAS.\r\nI have been seeking you this hour, my lord.\r\nHector, by this, is arming him in Troy;\r\nAjax, your guard, stays to conduct you home.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nHave with you, Prince. My courteous lord, adieu.\r\nFairwell, revolted fair! and, Diomed,\r\nStand fast, and wear a castle on thy head.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nI’ll bring you to the gates.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nAccept distracted thanks.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Troilus, Aeneas and Ulysses_.]\r\n\r\nTHERSITES. Would I could meet that rogue Diomed! I would croak like a\r\nraven; I would bode, I would bode. Patroclus will give me anything for\r\nthe intelligence of this whore; the parrot will not do more for an\r\nalmond than he for a commodious drab. Lechery, lechery! Still wars and\r\nlechery! Nothing else holds fashion. A burning devil take them!\r\n\r\n [_Exit_.]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. Troy.

The gods have heard me swear.\r\n\r\nCASSANDRA.\r\nThe gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows;\r\nThey are polluted off’rings, more abhorr’d\r\nThan spotted livers in the sacrifice.\r\n\r\nANDROMACHE.\r\nO, be persuaded! Do not count it holy\r\nTo hurt by being just. It is as lawful,\r\nFor we would give much, to use violent thefts\r\nAnd rob in the behalf of charity.\r\n\r\nCASSANDRA.\r\nIt is the purpose that makes strong the vow;\r\nBut vows to every purpose must not hold.\r\nUnarm, sweet Hector.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nHold you still, I say.\r\nMine honour keeps the weather of my fate.\r\nLife every man holds dear; but the dear man\r\nHolds honour far more precious dear than life.\r\n\r\n Enter Troilus.\r\n\r\nHow now, young man! Mean’st thou to fight today?\r\n\r\nANDROMACHE.\r\nCassandra, call my father to persuade.\r\n\r\n [_Exit_ Cassandra.]\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nNo, faith, young Troilus; doff thy harness, youth;\r\nI am today i’ th’vein of chivalry.\r\nLet grow thy sinews till their knots be strong,\r\nAnd tempt not yet the brushes of the war.\r\nUnarm thee, go; and doubt thou not, brave boy,\r\nI’ll stand today for thee and me and Troy.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nBrother, you have a vice of mercy in you,\r\nWhich better fits a lion than a man.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nWhat vice is that? Good Troilus, chide me for it.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nWhen many times the captive Grecian falls,\r\nEven in the fan and wind of your fair sword,\r\nYou bid them rise and live.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nO, ’tis fair play!\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nFool’s play, by heaven, Hector.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nHow now? how now?\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nFor th’ love of all the gods,\r\nLet’s leave the hermit Pity with our mother;\r\nAnd when we have our armours buckled on,\r\nThe venom’d vengeance ride upon our swords,\r\nSpur them to ruthful work, rein them from ruth!\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nFie, savage, fie!\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nHector, then ’tis wars.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nTroilus, I would not have you fight today.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nWho should withhold me?\r\nNot fate, obedience, nor the hand of Mars\r\nBeckoning with fiery truncheon my retire;\r\nNot Priamus and Hecuba on knees,\r\nTheir eyes o’er-galled with recourse of tears;\r\nNor you, my brother, with your true sword drawn,\r\nOppos’d to hinder me, should stop my way,\r\nBut by my ruin.\r\n\r\n Re-enter Cassandra with Priam.\r\n\r\nCASSANDRA.\r\nLay hold upon him, Priam, hold him fast;\r\nHe is thy crutch; now if thou lose thy stay,\r\nThou on him leaning, and all Troy on thee,\r\nFall all together.\r\n\r\nPRIAM.\r\nCome, Hector, come, go back.\r\nThy wife hath dreamt; thy mother hath had visions;\r\nCassandra doth foresee; and I myself\r\nAm like a prophet suddenly enrapt\r\nTo tell thee that this day is ominous.\r\nTherefore, come back.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nAeneas is a-field;\r\nAnd I do stand engag’d to many Greeks,\r\nEven in the faith of valour, to appear\r\nThis morning to them.\r\n\r\nPRIAM.\r\nAy, but thou shalt not go.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nI must not break my faith.\r\nYou know me dutiful; therefore, dear sir,\r\nLet me not shame respect; but give me leave\r\nTo take that course by your consent and voice\r\nWhich you do here forbid me, royal Priam.\r\n\r\nCASSANDRA.\r\nO Priam, yield not to him!\r\n\r\nANDROMACHE.\r\nDo not, dear father.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nAndromache, I am offended with you.\r\nUpon the love you bear me, get you in.\r\n\r\n [_Exit_ Andromache.]\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nThis foolish, dreaming, superstitious girl\r\nMakes all these bodements.\r\n\r\nCASSANDRA.\r\nO, farewell, dear Hector!\r\nLook how thou diest.

Hector’s dead! O Hector!’\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nAway, away!\r\n\r\nCASSANDRA.\r\nFarewell! yet, soft!

Do you hear?\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nWhat now?\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nHere’s a letter come from yond poor girl.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nLet me read.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nA whoreson tisick, a whoreson rascally tisick, so troubles me, and the\r\nfoolish fortune of this girl, and what one thing, what another, that I\r\nshall leave you one o’ these days; and I have a rheum in mine eyes too,\r\nand such an ache in my bones that unless a man were curs’d I cannot\r\ntell what to think on’t.

The plain between Troy and the Grecian camp.\r\n\r\n Alarums. Excursions. Enter Thersites.\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nNow they are clapper-clawing one another; I’ll go look on. That\r\ndissembling abominable varlet, Diomed, has got that same scurvy doting\r\nfoolish young knave’s sleeve of Troy there in his helm. I would fain\r\nsee them meet, that that same young Trojan ass that loves the whore\r\nthere might send that Greekish whoremasterly villain with the sleeve\r\nback to the dissembling luxurious drab of a sleeve-less errand. O’ the\r\nother side, the policy of those crafty swearing rascals that stale old\r\nmouse-eaten dry cheese, Nestor, and that same dog-fox, Ulysses, is not\r\nprov’d worth a blackberry. They set me up, in policy, that mongrel cur,\r\nAjax, against that dog of as bad a kind, Achilles; and now is the cur,\r\nAjax prouder than the cur Achilles, and will not arm today; whereupon\r\nthe Grecians begin to proclaim barbarism, and policy grows into an ill\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\n Enter Diomedes, Troilus following.\r\n\r\nSoft! here comes sleeve, and t’other.\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nFly not; for shouldst thou take the river Styx, I would swim after.\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nThou dost miscall retire.\r\nI do not fly; but advantageous care\r\nWithdrew me from the odds of multitude.\r\nHave at thee!\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nHold thy whore, Grecian; now for thy whore,\r\nTrojan! now the sleeve, now the sleeve!\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Troilus and Diomedes fighting_.]\r\n\r\n Enter Hector.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nWhat art thou, Greek? Art thou for Hector’s match?\r\nArt thou of blood and honour?\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nNo, no I am a rascal; a scurvy railing knave; a very filthy rogue.\r\n\r\nHECTOR.\r\nI do believe thee. Live.\r\n\r\n [_Exit_.]\r\n\r\nTHERSITES.\r\nGod-a-mercy, that thou wilt believe me; but a plague break thy neck for\r\nfrighting me! What’s become of the wenching rogues?

Polixenes is slain;\r\nAmphimacus and Thoas deadly hurt;\r\nPatroclus ta’en, or slain; and Palamedes\r\nSore hurt and bruis’d. The dreadful Sagittary\r\nAppals our numbers. Haste we, Diomed,\r\nTo reinforcement, or we perish all.\r\n\r\n Enter Nestor.\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\nGo, bear Patroclus’ body to Achilles,\r\nAnd bid the snail-pac’d Ajax arm for shame.\r\nThere is a thousand Hectors in the field;\r\nNow here he fights on Galathe his horse,\r\nAnd there lacks work; anon he’s there afoot,\r\nAnd there they fly or die, like scaled sculls\r\nBefore the belching whale; then is he yonder,\r\nAnd there the strawy Greeks, ripe for his edge,\r\nFall down before him like the mower’s swath.\r\nHere, there, and everywhere, he leaves and takes;\r\nDexterity so obeying appetite\r\nThat what he will he does, and does so much\r\nThat proof is call’d impossibility.\r\n\r\n Enter Ulysses.\r\n\r\nULYSSES.\r\nO, courage, courage, courage, Princes! Great Achilles\r\nIs arming, weeping, cursing, vowing vengeance.\r\nPatroclus’ wounds have rous’d his drowsy blood,\r\nTogether with his mangled Myrmidons,\r\nThat noseless, handless, hack’d and chipp’d, come to him,\r\nCrying on Hector. Ajax hath lost a friend\r\nAnd foams at mouth, and he is arm’d and at it,\r\nRoaring for Troilus; who hath done today\r\nMad and fantastic execution,\r\nEngaging and redeeming of himself\r\nWith such a careless force and forceless care\r\nAs if that lust, in very spite of cunning,\r\nBade him win all.\r\n\r\n Enter Ajax.\r\n\r\nAJAX.\r\nTroilus! thou coward Troilus!\r\n\r\n [_Exit_.]\r\n\r\nDIOMEDES.\r\nAy, there, there.\r\n\r\nNESTOR.\r\nSo, so, we draw together.\r\n\r\n [_Exit_.]\r\n\r\n Enter Achilles.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nWhere is this Hector?\r\nCome, come, thou boy-queller, show thy face;\r\nKnow what it is to meet Achilles angry.\r\nHector! where’s Hector?

Now, Troy, sink down;\r\nHere lies thy heart, thy sinews, and thy bone.\r\nOn, Myrmidons, and cry you all amain\r\n‘Achilles hath the mighty Hector slain.’\r\n\r\n [_A retreat sounded_.]\r\n\r\nHark! a retire upon our Grecian part.\r\n\r\nMYRMIDON.\r\nThe Trojan trumpets sound the like, my lord.\r\n\r\nACHILLES.\r\nThe dragon wing of night o’erspreads the earth\r\nAnd, stickler-like, the armies separates.\r\nMy half-supp’d sword, that frankly would have fed,\r\nPleas’d with this dainty bait, thus goes to bed.\r\n\r\n [_Sheathes his sword_.]\r\n\r\nCome, tie his body to my horse’s tail;\r\nAlong the field I will the Trojan trail.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt_.]\r\n\r\nSCENE IX.

Let one be sent\r\nTo pray Achilles see us at our tent.\r\nIf in his death the gods have us befriended;\r\nGreat Troy is ours, and our sharp wars are ended.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt_.]\r\n\r\nSCENE X.

Hector is gone.\r\nWho shall tell Priam so, or Hecuba?\r\nLet him that will a screech-owl aye be call’d\r\nGo in to Troy, and say there ‘Hector’s dead.’\r\nThere is a word will Priam turn to stone;\r\nMake wells and Niobes of the maids and wives,\r\nCold statues of the youth; and, in a word,\r\nScare Troy out of itself. But, march away;\r\nHector is dead; there is no more to say.\r\nStay yet. You vile abominable tents,\r\nThus proudly pight upon our Phrygian plains,\r\nLet Titan rise as early as he dare,\r\nI’ll through and through you. And, thou great-siz’d coward,\r\nNo space of earth shall sunder our two hates;\r\nI’ll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still,\r\nThat mouldeth goblins swift as frenzy’s thoughts.\r\nStrike a free march to Troy. With comfort go;\r\nHope of revenge shall hide our inward woe.\r\n\r\n Enter Pandarus.\r\n\r\nPANDARUS.\r\nBut hear you, hear you!\r\n\r\nTROILUS.\r\nHence, broker-lackey.

I\r\nam sure care’s an enemy to life.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nBy my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o’ nights; your cousin,\r\nmy lady, takes great exceptions to your ill hours.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhy, let her except, before excepted.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nAy, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits of order.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nConfine? I’ll confine myself no finer than I am. These clothes are good\r\nenough to drink in, and so be these boots too; and they be not, let\r\nthem hang themselves in their own straps.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nThat quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heard my lady talk of it\r\nyesterday; and of a foolish knight that you brought in one night here\r\nto be her wooer.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWho? Sir Andrew Aguecheek?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nAy, he.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nHe’s as tall a man as any’s in Illyria.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nWhat’s that to th’ purpose?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhy, he has three thousand ducats a year.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nAy, but he’ll have but a year in all these ducats. He’s a very fool,\r\nand a prodigal.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nFie, that you’ll say so! he plays o’ the viol-de-gamboys, and speaks\r\nthree or four languages word for word without book, and hath all the\r\ngood gifts of nature.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nHe hath indeed, almost natural: for, besides that he’s a fool, he’s a\r\ngreat quarreller; and, but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay\r\nthe gust he hath in quarrelling, ’tis thought among the prudent he\r\nwould quickly have the gift of a grave.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nBy this hand, they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of him.\r\nWho are they?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nThey that add, moreover, he’s drunk nightly in your company.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWith drinking healths to my niece; I’ll drink to her as long as there\r\nis a passage in my throat, and drink in Illyria. He’s a coward and a\r\ncoystril that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o’ the\r\ntoe like a parish top. What, wench! _Castiliano vulgo:_ for here comes\r\nSir Andrew Agueface.\r\n\r\n Enter Sir Andrew.\r\n\r\nAGUECHEEK.\r\nSir Toby Belch!

Is that the\r\nmeaning of accost?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nFare you well, gentlemen.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nAnd thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst never draw sword\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAnd you part so, mistress, I would I might never draw sword again. Fair\r\nlady, do you think you have fools in hand?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nSir, I have not you by the hand.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nMarry, but you shall have, and here’s my hand.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nNow, sir, thought is free. I pray you, bring your hand to th’ buttery\r\nbar and let it drink.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nWherefore, sweetheart? What’s your metaphor?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nIt’s dry, sir.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nWhy, I think so; I am not such an ass but I can keep my hand dry. But\r\nwhat’s your jest?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nA dry jest, sir.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAre you full of them?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nAy, sir, I have them at my fingers’ ends: marry, now I let go your\r\nhand, I am barren.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Maria._]\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nO knight, thou lack’st a cup of canary: When did I see thee so put\r\ndown?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nNever in your life, I think, unless you see canary put me down.\r\nMethinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary\r\nman has; but I am a great eater of beef, and I believe that does harm\r\nto my wit.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nNo question.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAnd I thought that, I’d forswear it. I’ll ride home tomorrow, Sir Toby.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n_Pourquoy_, my dear knight?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nWhat is _pourquoy?_ Do, or not do? I would I had bestowed that time in\r\nthe tongues that I have in fencing, dancing, and bear-baiting. O, had I\r\nbut followed the arts!\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nThen hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nWhy, would that have mended my hair?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nPast question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nBut it becomes me well enough, does’t not?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nExcellent, it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I hope to see a\r\nhuswife take thee between her legs, and spin it off.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nFaith, I’ll home tomorrow, Sir Toby; your niece will not be seen, or if\r\nshe be, it’s four to one she’ll none of me; the Count himself here hard\r\nby woos her.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nShe’ll none o’ the Count; she’ll not match above her degree, neither in\r\nestate, years, nor wit; I have heard her swear’t. Tut, there’s life\r\nin’t, man.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nI’ll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o’ the strangest mind i’ the\r\nworld; I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nArt thou good at these kick-shawses, knight?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAs any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the degree of my\r\nbetters; and yet I will not compare with an old man.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhat is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nFaith, I can cut a caper.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nAnd I can cut the mutton to’t.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAnd I think I have the back-trick simply as strong as any man in\r\nIllyria.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWherefore are these things hid? Wherefore have these gifts a curtain\r\nbefore ’em? Are they like to take dust, like Mistress Mall’s picture?\r\nWhy dost thou not go to church in a galliard, and come home in a\r\ncoranto? My very walk should be a jig; I would not so much as make\r\nwater but in a sink-a-pace. What dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide\r\nvirtues in? I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy leg, it\r\nwas formed under the star of a galliard.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAy, ’tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a dam’d-colour’d\r\nstock. Shall we set about some revels?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhat shall we do else? Were we not born under Taurus?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nTaurus? That’s sides and heart.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nNo, sir, it is legs and thighs. Let me see thee caper. Ha, higher: ha,\r\nha, excellent!\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV.

Some four or five attend him:\r\nAll, if you will; for I myself am best\r\nWhen least in company. Prosper well in this,\r\nAnd thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,\r\nTo call his fortunes thine.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI’ll do my best\r\nTo woo your lady.

Well, go thy way; if Sir Toby would leave\r\ndrinking, thou wert as witty a piece of Eve’s flesh as any in Illyria.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nPeace, you rogue, no more o’ that. Here comes my lady: make your excuse\r\nwisely, you were best.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\n Enter Olivia with Malvolio.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWit, and’t be thy will, put me into good fooling! Those wits that think\r\nthey have thee, do very oft prove fools; and I that am sure I lack\r\nthee, may pass for a wise man. For what says Quinapalus? Better a witty\r\nfool than a foolish wit. God bless thee, lady!\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nTake the fool away.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nDo you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nGo to, y’are a dry fool; I’ll no more of you. Besides, you grow\r\ndishonest.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nTwo faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel will amend: for give\r\nthe dry fool drink, then is the fool not dry; bid the dishonest man\r\nmend himself, if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if he cannot, let\r\nthe botcher mend him. Anything that’s mended is but patched; virtue\r\nthat transgresses is but patched with sin, and sin that amends is but\r\npatched with virtue. If that this simple syllogism will serve, so; if\r\nit will not, what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but calamity, so\r\nbeauty’s a flower. The lady bade take away the fool, therefore, I say\r\nagain, take her away.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nSir, I bade them take away you.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nMisprision in the highest degree! Lady, _cucullus non facit monachum:_\r\nthat’s as much to say, I wear not motley in my brain. Good madonna,\r\ngive me leave to prove you a fool.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nCan you do it?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nDexteriously, good madonna.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nMake your proof.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nI must catechize you for it, madonna. Good my mouse of virtue, answer\r\nme.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWell sir, for want of other idleness, I’ll ’bide your proof.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nGood madonna, why mourn’st thou?\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nGood fool, for my brother’s death.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nI think his soul is in hell, madonna.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nI know his soul is in heaven, fool.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nThe more fool you, madonna, to mourn for your brother’s soul being in\r\nheaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhat think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he not mend?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nYes; and shall do, till the pangs of death shake him. Infirmity, that\r\ndecays the wise, doth ever make the better fool.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nGod send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the better increasing your\r\nfolly! Sir Toby will be sworn that I am no fox; but he will not pass\r\nhis word for twopence that you are no fool.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nHow say you to that, Malvolio?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nI marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal; I saw him\r\nput down the other day with an ordinary fool, that has no more brain\r\nthan a stone. Look you now, he’s out of his guard already; unless you\r\nlaugh and minister occasion to him, he is gagged. I protest I take\r\nthese wise men, that crow so at these set kind of fools, no better than\r\nthe fools’ zanies.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nO, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste with a distempered\r\nappetite. To be generous, guiltless, and of free disposition, is to\r\ntake those things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon bullets. There is\r\nno slander in an allowed fool, though he do nothing but rail; nor no\r\nrailing in a known discreet man, though he do nothing but reprove.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNow Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou speak’st well of fools!\r\n\r\n Enter Maria.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nMadam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to speak\r\nwith you.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nFrom the Count Orsino, is it?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nI know not, madam; ’tis a fair young man, and well attended.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWho of my people hold him in delay?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nSir Toby, madam, your kinsman.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nFetch him off, I pray you; he speaks nothing but madman. Fie on him!\r\n\r\n [_Exit Maria._]\r\n\r\nGo you, Malvolio. If it be a suit from the Count, I am sick, or not at\r\nhome. What you will, to dismiss it.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Malvolio._]\r\n\r\nNow you see, sir, how your fooling grows old, and people dislike it.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nThou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldest son should be a fool:\r\nwhose skull Jove cram with brains, for here he comes, one of thy kin\r\nhas a most weak _pia mater_.\r\n\r\n Enter Sir Toby.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nBy mine honour, half drunk. What is he at the gate, cousin?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nA gentleman.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nA gentleman? What gentleman?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n’Tis a gentleman here. A plague o’ these pickle-herrings! How now, sot?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nGood Sir Toby.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nCousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nLechery! I defy lechery. There’s one at the gate.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nAy, marry, what is he?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nLet him be the devil an he will, I care not: give me faith, say I.\r\nWell, it’s all one.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhat’s a drunken man like, fool?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nLike a drowned man, a fool, and a madman: one draught above heat makes\r\nhim a fool, the second mads him, and a third drowns him.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nGo thou and seek the coroner, and let him sit o’ my coz; for he’s in\r\nthe third degree of drink; he’s drowned. Go, look after him.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nHe is but mad yet, madonna; and the fool shall look to the madman.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Clown._]\r\n\r\n Enter Malvolio.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nMadam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with you. I told him you\r\nwere sick; he takes on him to understand so much, and therefore comes\r\nto speak with you. I told him you were asleep; he seems to have a\r\nforeknowledge of that too, and therefore comes to speak with you. What\r\nis to be said to him, lady? He’s fortified against any denial.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nTell him, he shall not speak with me.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nHas been told so; and he says he’ll stand at your door like a sheriff’s\r\npost, and be the supporter of a bench, but he’ll speak with you.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhat kind o’ man is he?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nWhy, of mankind.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhat manner of man?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nOf very ill manner; he’ll speak with you, will you or no.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nOf what personage and years is he?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nNot yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for a boy; as a squash\r\nis before ’tis a peascod, or a codling, when ’tis almost an apple. ’Tis\r\nwith him in standing water, between boy and man. He is very\r\nwell-favoured, and he speaks very shrewishly. One would think his\r\nmother’s milk were scarce out of him.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nLet him approach. Call in my gentlewoman.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nGentlewoman, my lady calls.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\n Enter Maria.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nGive me my veil; come, throw it o’er my face.\r\nWe’ll once more hear Orsino’s embassy.\r\n\r\n Enter Viola.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nThe honourable lady of the house, which is she?\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nSpeak to me; I shall answer for her. Your will?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nMost radiant, exquisite, and unmatchable beauty,—I pray you, tell me if\r\nthis be the lady of the house, for I never saw her. I would be loath to\r\ncast away my speech; for besides that it is excellently well penned, I\r\nhave taken great pains to con it. Good beauties, let me sustain no\r\nscorn; I am very comptible, even to the least sinister usage.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhence came you, sir?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI can say little more than I have studied, and that question’s out of\r\nmy part. Good gentle one, give me modest assurance, if you be the lady\r\nof the house, that I may proceed in my speech.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nAre you a comedian?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nNo, my profound heart: and yet, by the very fangs of malice I swear, I\r\nam not that I play. Are you the lady of the house?\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nIf I do not usurp myself, I am.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nMost certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself; for what is yours\r\nto bestow is not yours to reserve. But this is from my commission. I\r\nwill on with my speech in your praise, and then show you the heart of\r\nmy message.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nCome to what is important in’t: I forgive you the praise.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nAlas, I took great pains to study it, and ’tis poetical.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nIt is the more like to be feigned; I pray you keep it in. I heard you\r\nwere saucy at my gates; and allowed your approach, rather to wonder at\r\nyou than to hear you. If you be mad, be gone; if you have reason, be\r\nbrief: ’tis not that time of moon with me to make one in so skipping a\r\ndialogue.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nWill you hoist sail, sir? Here lies your way.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nNo, good swabber, I am to hull here a little longer. Some mollification\r\nfor your giant, sweet lady. Tell me your mind. I am a messenger.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nSure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when the courtesy of it\r\nis so fearful. Speak your office.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nIt alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of war, no taxation of\r\nhomage; I hold the olive in my hand: my words are as full of peace as\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nYet you began rudely. What are you? What would you?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nThe rudeness that hath appeared in me have I learned from my\r\nentertainment. What I am and what I would are as secret as maidenhead:\r\nto your ears, divinity; to any other’s, profanation.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nGive us the place alone: we will hear this divinity.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Maria._]\r\n\r\nNow, sir, what is your text?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nMost sweet lady—\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nA comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it. Where lies your\r\ntext?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nIn Orsino’s bosom.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nIn his bosom? In what chapter of his bosom?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nTo answer by the method, in the first of his heart.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nO, I have read it; it is heresy. Have you no more to say?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nGood madam, let me see your face.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nHave you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face? You\r\nare now out of your text: but we will draw the curtain and show you the\r\npicture. [_Unveiling._] Look you, sir, such a one I was this present.\r\nIs’t not well done?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nExcellently done, if God did all.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\n’Tis in grain, sir; ’twill endure wind and weather.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\n’Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white\r\nNature’s own sweet and cunning hand laid on.\r\nLady, you are the cruel’st she alive\r\nIf you will lead these graces to the grave,\r\nAnd leave the world no copy.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nO, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will give out divers schedules\r\nof my beauty. It shall be inventoried and every particle and utensil\r\nlabelled to my will: as, item, two lips indifferent red; item, two grey\r\neyes with lids to them; item, one neck, one chin, and so forth. Were\r\nyou sent hither to praise me?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI see you what you are, you are too proud;\r\nBut, if you were the devil, you are fair.\r\nMy lord and master loves you. O, such love\r\nCould be but recompens’d though you were crown’d\r\nThe nonpareil of beauty!\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nHow does he love me?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nWith adorations, fertile tears,\r\nWith groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nYour lord does know my mind, I cannot love him:\r\nYet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,\r\nOf great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;\r\nIn voices well divulg’d, free, learn’d, and valiant,\r\nAnd in dimension and the shape of nature,\r\nA gracious person. But yet I cannot love him.\r\nHe might have took his answer long ago.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nIf I did love you in my master’s flame,\r\nWith such a suff’ring, such a deadly life,\r\nIn your denial I would find no sense,\r\nI would not understand it.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhy, what would you?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nMake me a willow cabin at your gate,\r\nAnd call upon my soul within the house;\r\nWrite loyal cantons of contemned love,\r\nAnd sing them loud even in the dead of night;\r\nHallow your name to the reverberate hills,\r\nAnd make the babbling gossip of the air\r\nCry out Olivia! O, you should not rest\r\nBetween the elements of air and earth,\r\nBut you should pity me.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nYou might do much.\r\nWhat is your parentage?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nAbove my fortunes, yet my state is well:\r\nI am a gentleman.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nGet you to your lord;\r\nI cannot love him: let him send no more,\r\nUnless, perchance, you come to me again,\r\nTo tell me how he takes it. Fare you well:\r\nI thank you for your pains: spend this for me.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI am no fee’d post, lady; keep your purse;\r\nMy master, not myself, lacks recompense.\r\nLove make his heart of flint that you shall love,\r\nAnd let your fervour like my master’s be\r\nPlac’d in contempt. Farewell, fair cruelty.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhat is your parentage?\r\n‘Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:\r\nI am a gentleman.’ I’ll be sworn thou art;\r\nThy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions, and spirit,\r\nDo give thee five-fold blazon. Not too fast: soft, soft!\r\nUnless the master were the man. How now?\r\nEven so quickly may one catch the plague?\r\nMethinks I feel this youth’s perfections\r\nWith an invisible and subtle stealth\r\nTo creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be.\r\nWhat ho, Malvolio!\r\n\r\n Enter Malvolio.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nHere, madam, at your service.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nRun after that same peevish messenger\r\nThe County’s man: he left this ring behind him,\r\nWould I or not; tell him, I’ll none of it.\r\nDesire him not to flatter with his lord,\r\nNor hold him up with hopes; I am not for him.\r\nIf that the youth will come this way tomorrow,\r\nI’ll give him reasons for’t. Hie thee, Malvolio.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nMadam, I will.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nI do I know not what, and fear to find\r\nMine eye too great a flatterer for my mind.\r\nFate, show thy force, ourselves we do not owe.\r\nWhat is decreed must be; and be this so!\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\nACT II.\r\n\r\nSCENE I. The sea-coast.\r\n\n Enter Antonio and Sebastian.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nWill you stay no longer? Nor will you not that I go with you?\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nBy your patience, no; my stars shine darkly over me; the malignancy of\r\nmy fate might perhaps distemper yours; therefore I shall crave of you\r\nyour leave that I may bear my evils alone. It were a bad recompense for\r\nyour love, to lay any of them on you.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nLet me know of you whither you are bound.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nNo, sooth, sir; my determinate voyage is mere extravagancy. But I\r\nperceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty, that you will not\r\nextort from me what I am willing to keep in. Therefore it charges me in\r\nmanners the rather to express myself. You must know of me then,\r\nAntonio, my name is Sebastian, which I called Roderigo; my father was\r\nthat Sebastian of Messaline whom I know you have heard of. He left\r\nbehind him myself and a sister, both born in an hour. If the heavens\r\nhad been pleased, would we had so ended! But you, sir, altered that,\r\nfor some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my\r\nsister drowned.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nAlas the day!\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nA lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled me, was yet of many\r\naccounted beautiful. But though I could not with such estimable wonder\r\noverfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly publish her, she bore\r\na mind that envy could not but call fair. She is drowned already, sir,\r\nwith salt water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nPardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nO good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nIf you will not murder me for my love, let me be your servant.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nIf you will not undo what you have done, that is, kill him whom you\r\nhave recovered, desire it not. Fare ye well at once; my bosom is full\r\nof kindness, and I am yet so near the manners of my mother, that upon\r\nthe least occasion more, mine eyes will tell tales of me. I am bound to\r\nthe Count Orsino’s court: farewell.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nThe gentleness of all the gods go with thee!\r\nI have many enemies in Orsino’s court,\r\nElse would I very shortly see thee there:\r\nBut come what may, I do adore thee so,\r\nThat danger shall seem sport, and I will go.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. A street.\r\n\r\n Enter Viola; Malvolio at several doors.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nWere you not even now with the Countess Olivia?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nEven now, sir; on a moderate pace I have since arrived but hither.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nShe returns this ring to you, sir; you might have saved me my pains, to\r\nhave taken it away yourself. She adds, moreover, that you should put\r\nyour lord into a desperate assurance she will none of him. And one\r\nthing more, that you be never so hardy to come again in his affairs,\r\nunless it be to report your lord’s taking of this. Receive it so.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nShe took the ring of me: I’ll none of it.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nCome sir, you peevishly threw it to her; and her will is it should be\r\nso returned. If it be worth stooping for, there it lies in your eye; if\r\nnot, be it his that finds it.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI left no ring with her; what means this lady?\r\nFortune forbid my outside have not charm’d her!\r\nShe made good view of me, indeed, so much,\r\nThat methought her eyes had lost her tongue,\r\nFor she did speak in starts distractedly.\r\nShe loves me, sure, the cunning of her passion\r\nInvites me in this churlish messenger.\r\nNone of my lord’s ring? Why, he sent her none.\r\nI am the man; if it be so, as ’tis,\r\nPoor lady, she were better love a dream.\r\nDisguise, I see thou art a wickedness\r\nWherein the pregnant enemy does much.\r\nHow easy is it for the proper false\r\nIn women’s waxen hearts to set their forms!\r\nAlas, our frailty is the cause, not we,\r\nFor such as we are made of, such we be.\r\nHow will this fadge? My master loves her dearly,\r\nAnd I, poor monster, fond as much on him,\r\nAnd she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.\r\nWhat will become of this? As I am man,\r\nMy state is desperate for my master’s love;\r\nAs I am woman (now alas the day!)\r\nWhat thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!\r\nO time, thou must untangle this, not I,\r\nIt is too hard a knot for me t’untie!\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. A Room in Olivia’s House.\r\n\r\n Enter Sir Toby and Sir Andrew.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nApproach, Sir Andrew; not to be abed after midnight, is to be up\r\nbetimes; and _diluculo surgere_, thou know’st.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nNay, by my troth, I know not; but I know to be up late is to be up\r\nlate.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nA false conclusion; I hate it as an unfilled can. To be up after\r\nmidnight, and to go to bed then is early: so that to go to bed after\r\nmidnight is to go to bed betimes. Does not our lives consist of the\r\nfour elements?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nFaith, so they say, but I think it rather consists of eating and\r\ndrinking.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nTh’art a scholar; let us therefore eat and drink.\r\nMarian, I say! a stoup of wine.\r\n\r\n Enter Clown.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nHere comes the fool, i’ faith.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nHow now, my hearts? Did you never see the picture of “we three”?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWelcome, ass. Now let’s have a catch.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nBy my troth, the fool has an excellent breast. I had rather than forty\r\nshillings I had such a leg, and so sweet a breath to sing, as the fool\r\nhas. In sooth, thou wast in very gracious fooling last night when thou\r\nspok’st of Pigrogromitus, of the Vapians passing the equinoctial of\r\nQueubus; ’twas very good, i’ faith. I sent thee sixpence for thy leman.\r\nHadst it?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nI did impeticos thy gratillity; for Malvolio’s nose is no whipstock. My\r\nlady has a white hand, and the Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nExcellent! Why, this is the best fooling, when all is done. Now, a\r\nsong.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nCome on, there is sixpence for you. Let’s have a song.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nThere’s a testril of me too: if one knight give a—\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWould you have a love-song, or a song of good life?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nA love-song, a love-song.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAy, ay. I care not for good life.\r\n\r\nCLOWN. [_sings._]\r\n _O mistress mine, where are you roaming?\r\n O stay and hear, your true love’s coming,\r\n That can sing both high and low.\r\n Trip no further, pretty sweeting.\r\n Journeys end in lovers meeting,\r\n Every wise man’s son doth know._\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nExcellent good, i’ faith.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nGood, good.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\n _What is love? ’Tis not hereafter,\r\n Present mirth hath present laughter.\r\n What’s to come is still unsure.\r\n In delay there lies no plenty,\r\n Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty.\r\n Youth’s a stuff will not endure._\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nA mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nA contagious breath.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nVery sweet and contagious, i’ faith.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nTo hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion. But shall we make the\r\nwelkin dance indeed? Shall we rouse the night-owl in a catch that will\r\ndraw three souls out of one weaver? Shall we do that?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAnd you love me, let’s do’t: I am dog at a catch.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nBy’r lady, sir, and some dogs will catch well.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nMost certain.

I shall be constrain’d in’t to\r\ncall thee knave, knight.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\n’Tis not the first time I have constrained one to call me knave. Begin,\r\nfool; it begins “Hold thy peace.”\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nI shall never begin if I hold my peace.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nGood, i’ faith! Come, begin.\r\n\r\n [_Catch sung._]\r\n\r\n Enter Maria.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nWhat a caterwauling do you keep here! If my lady have not called up her\r\nsteward Malvolio, and bid him turn you out of doors, never trust me.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nMy lady’s a Cataian, we are politicians, Malvolio’s a Peg-a-Ramsey, and\r\n[_Sings._] _Three merry men be we._ Am not I consanguineous? Am I not\r\nof her blood? Tilly-vally! “Lady”! _There dwelt a man in Babylon, Lady,\r\nLady._\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nBeshrew me, the knight’s in admirable fooling.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAy, he does well enough if he be disposed, and so do I too; he does it\r\nwith a better grace, but I do it more natural.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n[_Sings._] _O’ the twelfth day of December—_\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nFor the love o’ God, peace!\r\n\r\n Enter Malvolio.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nMy masters, are you mad? Or what are you? Have you no wit, manners, nor\r\nhonesty, but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night? Do ye make\r\nan ale-house of my lady’s house, that ye squeak out your coziers’\r\ncatches without any mitigation or remorse of voice? Is there no respect\r\nof place, persons, nor time, in you?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWe did keep time, sir, in our catches. Sneck up!\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nSir Toby, I must be round with you. My lady bade me tell you that,\r\nthough she harbours you as her kinsman she’s nothing allied to your\r\ndisorders. If you can separate yourself and your misdemeanours, you are\r\nwelcome to the house; if not, and it would please you to take leave of\r\nher, she is very willing to bid you farewell.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n[_Sings._] _Farewell, dear heart, since I must needs be gone._\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nNay, good Sir Toby.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\n[_Sings._] _His eyes do show his days are almost done._\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nIs’t even so?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n[_Sings._] _But I will never die._\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\n[_Sings._] _Sir Toby, there you lie._\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nThis is much credit to you.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n[_Sings._] _Shall I bid him go?_\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\n[_Sings._] _What and if you do?_\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n[_Sings._] _Shall I bid him go, and spare not?_\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\n[_Sings._] _O, no, no, no, no, you dare not._\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nOut o’ tune? sir, ye lie.

Go, sir, rub your chain with crumbs. A stoup of\r\nwine, Maria!\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nMistress Mary, if you prized my lady’s favour at anything more than\r\ncontempt, you would not give means for this uncivil rule; she shall\r\nknow of it, by this hand.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nGo shake your ears.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\n’Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man’s a-hungry, to challenge\r\nhim the field, and then to break promise with him and make a fool of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nDo’t, knight. I’ll write thee a challenge; or I’ll deliver thy\r\nindignation to him by word of mouth.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nSweet Sir Toby, be patient for tonight. Since the youth of the Count’s\r\nwas today with my lady, she is much out of quiet. For Monsieur\r\nMalvolio, let me alone with him. If I do not gull him into a nayword,\r\nand make him a common recreation, do not think I have wit enough to lie\r\nstraight in my bed. I know I can do it.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nPossess us, possess us, tell us something of him.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nMarry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of Puritan.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nO, if I thought that, I’d beat him like a dog.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhat, for being a Puritan? Thy exquisite reason, dear knight?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nI have no exquisite reason for’t, but I have reason good enough.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nThe devil a Puritan that he is, or anything constantly but a\r\ntime-pleaser, an affectioned ass that cons state without book and\r\nutters it by great swarths; the best persuaded of himself, so crammed\r\n(as he thinks) with excellencies, that it is his grounds of faith that\r\nall that look on him love him. And on that vice in him will my revenge\r\nfind notable cause to work.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhat wilt thou do?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nI will drop in his way some obscure epistles of love, wherein by the\r\ncolour of his beard, the shape of his leg, the manner of his gait, the\r\nexpressure of his eye, forehead, and complexion, he shall find himself\r\nmost feelingly personated. I can write very like my lady your niece; on\r\na forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our hands.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nExcellent! I smell a device.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nI have’t in my nose too.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nHe shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop, that they come from\r\nmy niece, and that she is in love with him.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nMy purpose is indeed a horse of that colour.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAnd your horse now would make him an ass.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nAss, I doubt not.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nO ’twill be admirable!\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nSport royal, I warrant you. I know my physic will work with him. I will\r\nplant you two, and let the fool make a third, where he shall find the\r\nletter. Observe his construction of it. For this night, to bed, and\r\ndream on the event. Farewell.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nGood night, Penthesilea.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nBefore me, she’s a good wench.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nShe’s a beagle true bred, and one that adores me.

Thou hadst need send for more money.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nIf I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way out.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nSend for money, knight; if thou hast her not i’ th’ end, call me cut.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nIf I do not, never trust me, take it how you will.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nCome, come, I’ll go burn some sack, ’tis too late to go to bed now.\r\nCome, knight, come, knight.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV.

Now, good morrow, friends.\r\nNow, good Cesario, but that piece of song,\r\nThat old and antique song we heard last night;\r\nMethought it did relieve my passion much,\r\nMore than light airs and recollected terms\r\nOf these most brisk and giddy-paced times.\r\nCome, but one verse.\r\n\r\nCURIO.\r\nHe is not here, so please your lordship, that should sing it.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWho was it?\r\n\r\nCURIO.\r\nFeste, the jester, my lord, a fool that the Lady Olivia’s father took\r\nmuch delight in. He is about the house.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nSeek him out, and play the tune the while.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Curio. Music plays._]\r\n\r\nCome hither, boy. If ever thou shalt love,\r\nIn the sweet pangs of it remember me:\r\nFor such as I am, all true lovers are,\r\nUnstaid and skittish in all motions else,\r\nSave in the constant image of the creature\r\nThat is belov’d. How dost thou like this tune?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nIt gives a very echo to the seat\r\nWhere love is throned.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThou dost speak masterly.\r\nMy life upon’t, young though thou art, thine eye\r\nHath stayed upon some favour that it loves.\r\nHath it not, boy?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nA little, by your favour.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWhat kind of woman is’t?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nOf your complexion.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nShe is not worth thee, then. What years, i’ faith?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nAbout your years, my lord.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nToo old, by heaven! Let still the woman take\r\nAn elder than herself; so wears she to him,\r\nSo sways she level in her husband’s heart.\r\nFor, boy, however we do praise ourselves,\r\nOur fancies are more giddy and unfirm,\r\nMore longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,\r\nThan women’s are.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI think it well, my lord.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThen let thy love be younger than thyself,\r\nOr thy affection cannot hold the bent:\r\nFor women are as roses, whose fair flower\r\nBeing once display’d, doth fall that very hour.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nAnd so they are: alas, that they are so;\r\nTo die, even when they to perfection grow!\r\n\r\n Enter Curio and Clown.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nO, fellow, come, the song we had last night.\r\nMark it, Cesario, it is old and plain;\r\nThe spinsters and the knitters in the sun,\r\nAnd the free maids, that weave their thread with bones\r\nDo use to chant it: it is silly sooth,\r\nAnd dallies with the innocence of love\r\nLike the old age.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nAre you ready, sir?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nAy; prithee, sing.\r\n\r\n [_Music._]\r\n\r\n The Clown’s song.\r\n\r\n_ Come away, come away, death.\r\n And in sad cypress let me be laid.\r\n Fly away, fly away, breath;\r\n I am slain by a fair cruel maid.\r\n My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,\r\n O, prepare it!\r\n My part of death no one so true\r\n Did share it._\r\n\r\n_ Not a flower, not a flower sweet,\r\n On my black coffin let there be strown:\r\n Not a friend, not a friend greet\r\n My poor corpse where my bones shall be thrown:\r\n A thousand thousand sighs to save,\r\n Lay me, O, where\r\n Sad true lover never find my grave,\r\n To weep there._\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThere’s for thy pains.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNo pains, sir; I take pleasure in singing, sir.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nI’ll pay thy pleasure, then.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nTruly sir, and pleasure will be paid one time or another.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nGive me now leave to leave thee.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNow the melancholy god protect thee, and the tailor make thy doublet of\r\nchangeable taffeta, for thy mind is a very opal.

Must she not then be answer’d?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThere is no woman’s sides\r\nCan bide the beating of so strong a passion\r\nAs love doth give my heart: no woman’s heart\r\nSo big, to hold so much; they lack retention.\r\nAlas, their love may be called appetite,\r\nNo motion of the liver, but the palate,\r\nThat suffer surfeit, cloyment, and revolt;\r\nBut mine is all as hungry as the sea,\r\nAnd can digest as much. Make no compare\r\nBetween that love a woman can bear me\r\nAnd that I owe Olivia.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nAy, but I know—\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWhat dost thou know?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nToo well what love women to men may owe.\r\nIn faith, they are as true of heart as we.\r\nMy father had a daughter loved a man,\r\nAs it might be perhaps, were I a woman,\r\nI should your lordship.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nAnd what’s her history?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nA blank, my lord. She never told her love,\r\nBut let concealment, like a worm i’ th’ bud,\r\nFeed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,\r\nAnd with a green and yellow melancholy\r\nShe sat like patience on a monument,\r\nSmiling at grief. Was not this love, indeed?\r\nWe men may say more, swear more, but indeed,\r\nOur shows are more than will; for still we prove\r\nMuch in our vows, but little in our love.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nBut died thy sister of her love, my boy?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI am all the daughters of my father’s house,\r\nAnd all the brothers too: and yet I know not.\r\nSir, shall I to this lady?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nAy, that’s the theme.\r\nTo her in haste. Give her this jewel; say\r\nMy love can give no place, bide no denay.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE V. Olivia’s garden.\r\n\r\n Enter Sir Toby, Sir Andrew and Fabian.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nCome thy ways, Signior Fabian.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nNay, I’ll come. If I lose a scruple of this sport, let me be boiled to\r\ndeath with melancholy.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally sheep-biter\r\ncome by some notable shame?\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nI would exult, man. You know he brought me out o’ favour with my lady\r\nabout a bear-baiting here.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nTo anger him we’ll have the bear again, and we will fool him black and\r\nblue, shall we not, Sir Andrew?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAnd we do not, it is pity of our lives.\r\n\r\n Enter Maria.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nHere comes the little villain. How now, my metal of India?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nGet ye all three into the box-tree. Malvolio’s coming down this walk;\r\nhe has been yonder i’ the sun practising behaviour to his own shadow\r\nthis half hour: observe him, for the love of mockery; for I know this\r\nletter will make a contemplative idiot of him. Close, in the name of\r\njesting! [_The men hide themselves._] Lie thou there; [_Throws down a\r\nletter_] for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Maria._]\r\n\r\n Enter Malvolio.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n’Tis but fortune, all is fortune. Maria once told me she did affect me,\r\nand I have heard herself come thus near, that should she fancy, it\r\nshould be one of my complexion. Besides, she uses me with a more\r\nexalted respect than anyone else that follows her. What should I think\r\non’t?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nHere’s an overweening rogue!\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nO, peace! Contemplation makes a rare turkey-cock of him; how he jets\r\nunder his advanced plumes!\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\n’Slight, I could so beat the rogue!\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nPeace, I say.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nTo be Count Malvolio.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nAh, rogue!\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nPistol him, pistol him.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nPeace, peace.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nThere is example for’t. The lady of the Strachy married the yeoman of\r\nthe wardrobe.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nFie on him, Jezebel!\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nO, peace! now he’s deeply in; look how imagination blows him.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nHaving been three months married to her, sitting in my state—\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nO for a stone-bow to hit him in the eye!\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nCalling my officers about me, in my branched velvet gown; having come\r\nfrom a day-bed, where I have left Olivia sleeping.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nFire and brimstone!\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nO, peace, peace.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nAnd then to have the humour of state; and after a demure travel of\r\nregard, telling them I know my place as I would they should do theirs,\r\nto ask for my kinsman Toby.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nBolts and shackles!\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nO, peace, peace, peace! Now, now.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nSeven of my people, with an obedient start, make out for him. I frown\r\nthe while, and perchance wind up my watch, or play with some rich\r\njewel. Toby approaches; curtsies there to me—\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nShall this fellow live?\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nThough our silence be drawn from us with cars, yet peace!\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nI extend my hand to him thus, quenching my familiar smile with an\r\naustere regard of control—\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nAnd does not Toby take you a blow o’ the lips then?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nSaying ‘Cousin Toby, my fortunes having cast me on your niece, give me\r\nthis prerogative of speech—’\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhat, what?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n‘You must amend your drunkenness.’\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nOut, scab!\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nNay, patience, or we break the sinews of our plot.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n‘Besides, you waste the treasure of your time with a foolish knight—’\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nThat’s me, I warrant you.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n‘One Sir Andrew.’\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nI knew ’twas I, for many do call me fool.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n[_Taking up the letter._] What employment have we here?\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nNow is the woodcock near the gin.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nO, peace! And the spirit of humours intimate reading aloud to him!\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nBy my life, this is my lady’s hand: these be her very C’s, her U’s, and\r\nher T’s, and thus makes she her great P’s. It is in contempt of\r\nquestion, her hand.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nHer C’s, her U’s, and her T’s. Why that?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n[_Reads._] _To the unknown beloved, this, and my good wishes._ Her very\r\nphrases! By your leave, wax. Soft! and the impressure her Lucrece, with\r\nwhich she uses to seal: ’tis my lady.

Why, this is evident to any formal capacity. There is\r\nno obstruction in this. And the end—what should that alphabetical\r\nposition portend? If I could make that resemble something in me!\r\nSoftly! ‘M.O.A.I.’—\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nO, ay, make up that:—he is now at a cold scent.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nSowter will cry upon’t for all this, though it be as rank as a fox.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n‘M’—Malvolio; ‘M!’ Why, that begins my name!\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nDid not I say he would work it out? The cur is excellent at faults.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n‘M’—But then there is no consonancy in the sequel; that suffers under\r\nprobation: ‘A’ should follow, but ‘O’ does.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nAnd ‘O’ shall end, I hope.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nAy, or I’ll cudgel him, and make him cry ‘O!’\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nAnd then ‘I’ comes behind.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nAy, and you had any eye behind you, you might see more detraction at\r\nyour heels than fortunes before you.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n‘M.O.A.I.’ This simulation is not as the former: and yet, to crush this\r\na little, it would bow to me, for every one of these letters are in my\r\nname. Soft, here follows prose.\r\n[_Reads._] _If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my stars I am above\r\nthee, but be not afraid of greatness.

She did commend my yellow stockings of\r\nlate, she did praise my leg being cross-gartered, and in this she\r\nmanifests herself to my love, and with a kind of injunction, drives me\r\nto these habits of her liking. I thank my stars, I am happy. I will be\r\nstrange, stout, in yellow stockings, and cross-gartered, even with the\r\nswiftness of putting on. Jove and my stars be praised!—Here is yet a\r\npostscript. [_Reads._] _Thou canst not choose but know who I am.

I will smile, I will do everything that\r\nthou wilt have me.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nI will not give my part of this sport for a pension of thousands to be\r\npaid from the Sophy.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nI could marry this wench for this device.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nSo could I too.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nAnd ask no other dowry with her but such another jest.\r\n\r\n Enter Maria.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nNor I neither.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nHere comes my noble gull-catcher.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWilt thou set thy foot o’ my neck?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nOr o’ mine either?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nShall I play my freedom at tray-trip, and become thy bond-slave?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nI’ faith, or I either?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhy, thou hast put him in such a dream, that when the image of it\r\nleaves him he must run mad.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nNay, but say true, does it work upon him?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nLike aqua-vitae with a midwife.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nIf you will then see the fruits of the sport, mark his first approach\r\nbefore my lady: he will come to her in yellow stockings, and ’tis a\r\ncolour she abhors, and cross-gartered, a fashion she detests; and he\r\nwill smile upon her, which will now be so unsuitable to her\r\ndisposition, being addicted to a melancholy as she is, that it cannot\r\nbut turn him into a notable contempt. If you will see it, follow me.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nTo the gates of Tartar, thou most excellent devil of wit!\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nI’ll make one too.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\nACT III.\r\n\r\nSCENE I. Olivia’s garden.\r\n\n Enter Viola and Clown with a tabor.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nSave thee, friend, and thy music. Dost thou live by thy tabor?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNo, sir, I live by the church.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nArt thou a churchman?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNo such matter, sir. I do live by the church, for I do live at my\r\nhouse, and my house doth stand by the church.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nSo thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar, if a beggar dwell near\r\nhim; or the church stands by thy tabor, if thy tabor stand by the\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nYou have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is but a chev’ril glove\r\nto a good wit. How quickly the wrong side may be turned outward!\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nNay, that’s certain; they that dally nicely with words may quickly make\r\nthem wanton.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nI would, therefore, my sister had had no name, sir.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nWhy, man?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWhy, sir, her name’s a word; and to dally with that word might make my\r\nsister wanton. But indeed, words are very rascals, since bonds\r\ndisgraced them.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nThy reason, man?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nTroth, sir, I can yield you none without words, and words are grown so\r\nfalse, I am loath to prove reason with them.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI warrant thou art a merry fellow, and car’st for nothing.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNot so, sir, I do care for something. But in my conscience, sir, I do\r\nnot care for you. If that be to care for nothing, sir, I would it would\r\nmake you invisible.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nArt not thou the Lady Olivia’s fool?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNo, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly. She will keep no fool,\r\nsir, till she be married, and fools are as like husbands as pilchards\r\nare to herrings, the husband’s the bigger. I am indeed not her fool,\r\nbut her corrupter of words.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI saw thee late at the Count Orsino’s.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nFoolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun; it shines\r\neverywhere. I would be sorry, sir, but the fool should be as oft with\r\nyour master as with my mistress. I think I saw your wisdom there.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nNay, and thou pass upon me, I’ll no more with thee. Hold, there’s\r\nexpenses for thee.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNow Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nBy my troth, I’ll tell thee, I am almost sick for one, though I would\r\nnot have it grow on my chin. Is thy lady within?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWould not a pair of these have bred, sir?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nYes, being kept together, and put to use.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nI would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to bring a Cressida to this\r\nTroilus.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI understand you, sir; ’tis well begged.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nThe matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging but a beggar: Cressida\r\nwas a beggar. My lady is within, sir. I will conster to them whence you\r\ncome; who you are and what you would are out of my welkin. I might say\r\n“element”, but the word is overworn.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nThis fellow is wise enough to play the fool,\r\nAnd to do that well, craves a kind of wit:\r\nHe must observe their mood on whom he jests,\r\nThe quality of persons, and the time,\r\nAnd like the haggard, check at every feather\r\nThat comes before his eye. This is a practice\r\nAs full of labour as a wise man’s art:\r\nFor folly, that he wisely shows, is fit;\r\nBut wise men, folly-fall’n, quite taint their wit.\r\n\r\n Enter Sir Toby and Sir Andrew.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nSave you, gentleman.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nAnd you, sir.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\n_Dieu vous garde, monsieur._\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\n_Et vous aussi; votre serviteur._\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nI hope, sir, you are, and I am yours.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWill you encounter the house? My niece is desirous you should enter, if\r\nyour trade be to her.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI am bound to your niece, sir, I mean, she is the list of my voyage.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nTaste your legs, sir, put them to motion.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nMy legs do better understand me, sir, than I understand what you mean\r\nby bidding me taste my legs.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nI mean, to go, sir, to enter.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI will answer you with gait and entrance: but we are prevented.\r\n\r\n Enter Olivia and Maria.\r\n\r\nMost excellent accomplished lady, the heavens rain odours on you!\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nThat youth’s a rare courtier. ‘Rain odours,’ well.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nMy matter hath no voice, lady, but to your own most pregnant and\r\nvouchsafed ear.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\n‘Odours,’ ‘pregnant,’ and ‘vouchsafed.’—I’ll get ’em all three ready.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nLet the garden door be shut, and leave me to my hearing.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Sir Toby, Sir Andrew and Maria._]\r\n\r\nGive me your hand, sir.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nMy duty, madam, and most humble service.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhat is your name?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nCesario is your servant’s name, fair princess.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nMy servant, sir! ’Twas never merry world,\r\nSince lowly feigning was call’d compliment:\r\nY’are servant to the Count Orsino, youth.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nAnd he is yours, and his must needs be yours.\r\nYour servant’s servant is your servant, madam.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nFor him, I think not on him: for his thoughts,\r\nWould they were blanks rather than fill’d with me!\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nMadam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts\r\nOn his behalf.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nO, by your leave, I pray you.\r\nI bade you never speak again of him.\r\nBut would you undertake another suit,\r\nI had rather hear you to solicit that\r\nThan music from the spheres.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nDear lady—\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nGive me leave, beseech you. I did send,\r\nAfter the last enchantment you did here,\r\nA ring in chase of you. So did I abuse\r\nMyself, my servant, and, I fear me, you.\r\nUnder your hard construction must I sit;\r\nTo force that on you in a shameful cunning,\r\nWhich you knew none of yours. What might you think?\r\nHave you not set mine honour at the stake,\r\nAnd baited it with all th’ unmuzzled thoughts\r\nThat tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving\r\nEnough is shown. A cypress, not a bosom,\r\nHides my heart: so let me hear you speak.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI pity you.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nThat’s a degree to love.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nNo, not a grize; for ’tis a vulgar proof\r\nThat very oft we pity enemies.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhy then methinks ’tis time to smile again.\r\nO world, how apt the poor are to be proud!\r\nIf one should be a prey, how much the better\r\nTo fall before the lion than the wolf! [_Clock strikes._]\r\nThe clock upbraids me with the waste of time.\r\nBe not afraid, good youth, I will not have you.\r\nAnd yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,\r\nYour wife is like to reap a proper man.\r\nThere lies your way, due west.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nThen westward ho!\r\nGrace and good disposition attend your ladyship!\r\nYou’ll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nStay:\r\nI prithee tell me what thou think’st of me.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nThat you do think you are not what you are.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nIf I think so, I think the same of you.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nThen think you right; I am not what I am.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nI would you were as I would have you be.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nWould it be better, madam, than I am?\r\nI wish it might, for now I am your fool.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nO what a deal of scorn looks beautiful\r\nIn the contempt and anger of his lip!\r\nA murd’rous guilt shows not itself more soon\r\nThan love that would seem hid. Love’s night is noon.\r\nCesario, by the roses of the spring,\r\nBy maidhood, honour, truth, and everything,\r\nI love thee so, that maugre all thy pride,\r\nNor wit nor reason can my passion hide.\r\nDo not extort thy reasons from this clause,\r\nFor that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause;\r\nBut rather reason thus with reason fetter:\r\nLove sought is good, but given unsought is better.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nBy innocence I swear, and by my youth,\r\nI have one heart, one bosom, and one truth,\r\nAnd that no woman has; nor never none\r\nShall mistress be of it, save I alone.\r\nAnd so adieu, good madam; never more\r\nWill I my master’s tears to you deplore.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nYet come again: for thou perhaps mayst move\r\nThat heart, which now abhors, to like his love.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. A Room in Olivia’s House.\r\n\r\n Enter Sir Toby, Sir Andrew and Fabian.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nNo, faith, I’ll not stay a jot longer.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nThy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nYou must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nMarry, I saw your niece do more favours to the Count’s servingman than\r\never she bestowed upon me; I saw’t i’ th’ orchard.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nDid she see thee the while, old boy? Tell me that.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAs plain as I see you now.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nThis was a great argument of love in her toward you.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\n’Slight! will you make an ass o’ me?\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nI will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of judgment and reason.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nAnd they have been grand-jurymen since before Noah was a sailor.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nShe did show favour to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you,\r\nto awake your dormouse valour, to put fire in your heart and brimstone\r\nin your liver. You should then have accosted her, and with some\r\nexcellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you should have banged the\r\nyouth into dumbness. This was looked for at your hand, and this was\r\nbalked: the double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash off, and\r\nyou are now sailed into the north of my lady’s opinion; where you will\r\nhang like an icicle on Dutchman’s beard, unless you do redeem it by\r\nsome laudable attempt, either of valour or policy.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAnd’t be any way, it must be with valour, for policy I hate; I had as\r\nlief be a Brownist as a politician.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhy, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valour. Challenge me\r\nthe Count’s youth to fight with him. Hurt him in eleven places; my\r\nniece shall take note of it, and assure thyself there is no love-broker\r\nin the world can more prevail in man’s commendation with woman than\r\nreport of valour.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nThere is no way but this, Sir Andrew.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nWill either of you bear me a challenge to him?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nGo, write it in a martial hand, be curst and brief; it is no matter how\r\nwitty, so it be eloquent and full of invention. Taunt him with the\r\nlicence of ink. If thou ‘thou’st’ him some thrice, it shall not be\r\namiss, and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of paper, although the\r\nsheet were big enough for the bed of Ware in England, set ’em down. Go\r\nabout it. Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou write with a\r\ngoose-pen, no matter. About it.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nWhere shall I find you?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWe’ll call thee at the cubiculo. Go.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Sir Andrew._]\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nThis is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nI have been dear to him, lad, some two thousand strong, or so.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nWe shall have a rare letter from him; but you’ll not deliver it.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nNever trust me then. And by all means stir on the youth to an answer. I\r\nthink oxen and wainropes cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he\r\nwere opened and you find so much blood in his liver as will clog the\r\nfoot of a flea, I’ll eat the rest of th’ anatomy.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nAnd his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage no great presage of\r\ncruelty.\r\n\r\n Enter Maria.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nLook where the youngest wren of nine comes.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nIf you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourselves into stitches,\r\nfollow me. Yond gull Malvolio is turned heathen, a very renegado; for\r\nthere is no Christian that means to be saved by believing rightly can\r\never believe such impossible passages of grossness. He’s in yellow\r\nstockings.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nAnd cross-gartered?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nMost villainously; like a pedant that keeps a school i’ th’ church. I\r\nhave dogged him like his murderer. He does obey every point of the\r\nletter that I dropped to betray him. He does smile his face into more\r\nlines than is in the new map with the augmentation of the Indies. You\r\nhave not seen such a thing as ’tis. I can hardly forbear hurling\r\nthings at him. I know my lady will strike him. If she do, he’ll smile\r\nand take’t for a great favour.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nCome, bring us, bring us where he is.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. A street.\r\n\r\n Enter Sebastian and Antonio.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nI would not by my will have troubled you,\r\nBut since you make your pleasure of your pains,\r\nI will no further chide you.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nI could not stay behind you: my desire,\r\nMore sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth;\r\nAnd not all love to see you, though so much,\r\nAs might have drawn one to a longer voyage,\r\nBut jealousy what might befall your travel,\r\nBeing skilless in these parts; which to a stranger,\r\nUnguided and unfriended, often prove\r\nRough and unhospitable. My willing love,\r\nThe rather by these arguments of fear,\r\nSet forth in your pursuit.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nMy kind Antonio,\r\nI can no other answer make but thanks,\r\nAnd thanks, and ever thanks; and oft good turns\r\nAre shuffled off with such uncurrent pay.\r\nBut were my worth, as is my conscience, firm,\r\nYou should find better dealing. What’s to do?\r\nShall we go see the relics of this town?\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nTomorrow, sir; best first go see your lodging.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nI am not weary, and ’tis long to night;\r\nI pray you, let us satisfy our eyes\r\nWith the memorials and the things of fame\r\nThat do renown this city.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nWould you’d pardon me.\r\nI do not without danger walk these streets.\r\nOnce in a sea-fight, ’gainst the Count his galleys,\r\nI did some service, of such note indeed,\r\nThat were I ta’en here, it would scarce be answer’d.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nBelike you slew great number of his people.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nTh’ offence is not of such a bloody nature,\r\nAlbeit the quality of the time and quarrel\r\nMight well have given us bloody argument.\r\nIt might have since been answered in repaying\r\nWhat we took from them, which for traffic’s sake,\r\nMost of our city did. Only myself stood out,\r\nFor which, if I be lapsed in this place,\r\nI shall pay dear.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nDo not then walk too open.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nIt doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here’s my purse.\r\nIn the south suburbs, at the Elephant,\r\nIs best to lodge. I will bespeak our diet\r\nWhiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge\r\nWith viewing of the town. There shall you have me.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nWhy I your purse?\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nHaply your eye shall light upon some toy\r\nYou have desire to purchase; and your store,\r\nI think, is not for idle markets, sir.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nI’ll be your purse-bearer, and leave you for an hour.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nTo th’ Elephant.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nI do remember.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV. Olivia’s garden.\r\n\r\n Enter Olivia and Maria.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nI have sent after him. He says he’ll come;\r\nHow shall I feast him? What bestow of him?\r\nFor youth is bought more oft than begg’d or borrow’d.\r\nI speak too loud.—\r\nWhere’s Malvolio?—He is sad and civil,\r\nAnd suits well for a servant with my fortunes;\r\nWhere is Malvolio?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nHe’s coming, madam:\r\nBut in very strange manner. He is sure possessed, madam.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhy, what’s the matter? Does he rave?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nNo, madam, he does nothing but smile: your ladyship were best to have\r\nsome guard about you if he come, for sure the man is tainted in ’s\r\nwits.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nGo call him hither. I’m as mad as he,\r\nIf sad and merry madness equal be.\r\n\r\n Enter Malvolio.\r\n\r\nHow now, Malvolio?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nSweet lady, ho, ho!\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nSmil’st thou? I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nSad, lady? I could be sad: this does make some obstruction in the\r\nblood, this cross-gartering. But what of that? If it please the eye of\r\none, it is with me as the very true sonnet is: ‘Please one and please\r\nall.’\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhy, how dost thou, man? What is the matter with thee?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nNot black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. It did come to his\r\nhands, and commands shall be executed. I think we do know the sweet\r\nRoman hand.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nTo bed? Ay, sweetheart, and I’ll come to thee.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nGod comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so, and kiss thy hand so oft?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nHow do you, Malvolio?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nAt your request? Yes, nightingales answer daws!\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nWhy appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n‘Be not afraid of greatness.’ ’Twas well writ.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhat mean’st thou by that, Malvolio?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n‘Some are born great’—\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nHa?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n‘Some achieve greatness’—\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhat say’st thou?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n‘And some have greatness thrust upon them.’\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nHeaven restore thee!\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n‘Remember who commended thy yellow stockings’—\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nThy yellow stockings?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n‘And wished to see thee cross-gartered.’\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nCross-gartered?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n‘Go to: thou art made, if thou desir’st to be so:’—\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nAm I made?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n‘If not, let me see thee a servant still.’\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhy, this is very midsummer madness.\r\n\r\n Enter Servant.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nMadam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino’s is returned; I could\r\nhardly entreat him back. He attends your ladyship’s pleasure.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nI’ll come to him.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Servant._]\r\n\r\nGood Maria, let this fellow be looked to. Where’s my cousin Toby? Let\r\nsome of my people have a special care of him; I would not have him\r\nmiscarry for the half of my dowry.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Olivia and Maria._]\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nO ho, do you come near me now? No worse man than Sir Toby to look to\r\nme. This concurs directly with the letter: she sends him on purpose,\r\nthat I may appear stubborn to him; for she incites me to that in the\r\nletter. ‘Cast thy humble slough,’ says she; ‘be opposite with a\r\nkinsman, surly with servants, let thy tongue tang with arguments of\r\nstate, put thyself into the trick of singularity,’ and consequently,\r\nsets down the manner how: as, a sad face, a reverend carriage, a slow\r\ntongue, in the habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have limed\r\nher, but it is Jove’s doing, and Jove make me thankful! And when she\r\nwent away now, ‘Let this fellow be looked to;’ ‘Fellow!’ not\r\n‘Malvolio’, nor after my degree, but ‘fellow’. Why, everything adheres\r\ntogether, that no dram of a scruple, no scruple of a scruple, no\r\nobstacle, no incredulous or unsafe circumstance. What can be said?\r\nNothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my\r\nhopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the doer of this, and he is to be thanked.\r\n\r\n Enter Sir Toby, Fabian and Maria.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhich way is he, in the name of sanctity? If all the devils of hell be\r\ndrawn in little, and Legion himself possessed him, yet I’ll speak to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nHere he is, here he is. How is’t with you, sir? How is’t with you, man?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nGo off, I discard you. Let me enjoy my private. Go off.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nLo, how hollow the fiend speaks within him! Did not I tell you? Sir\r\nToby, my lady prays you to have a care of him.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nAh, ha! does she so?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nGo to, go to; peace, peace, we must deal gently with him. Let me alone.\r\nHow do you, Malvolio? How is’t with you? What, man! defy the devil!\r\nConsider, he’s an enemy to mankind.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nDo you know what you say?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nLa you, an you speak ill of the devil, how he takes it at heart! Pray\r\nGod he be not bewitched.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nCarry his water to th’ wise woman.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nMarry, and it shall be done tomorrow morning, if I live. My lady would\r\nnot lose him for more than I’ll say.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nHow now, mistress!\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nO Lord!\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nPrithee hold thy peace, this is not the way. Do you not see you move\r\nhim? Let me alone with him.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nNo way but gentleness, gently, gently. The fiend is rough, and will not\r\nbe roughly used.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhy, how now, my bawcock? How dost thou, chuck?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nSir!\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nAy, biddy, come with me. What, man, ’tis not for gravity to play at\r\ncherry-pit with Satan. Hang him, foul collier!\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nGet him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby, get him to pray.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nMy prayers, minx?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nNo, I warrant you, he will not hear of godliness.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nGo, hang yourselves all! You are idle, shallow things. I am not of your\r\nelement. You shall know more hereafter.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nIs’t possible?\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nIf this were played upon a stage now, I could condemn it as an\r\nimprobable fiction.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nHis very genius hath taken the infection of the device, man.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nNay, pursue him now, lest the device take air and taint.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nWhy, we shall make him mad indeed.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nThe house will be the quieter.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nCome, we’ll have him in a dark room and bound. My niece is already in\r\nthe belief that he’s mad. We may carry it thus for our pleasure, and\r\nhis penance, till our very pastime, tired out of breath, prompt us to\r\nhave mercy on him, at which time we will bring the device to the bar,\r\nand crown thee for a finder of madmen. But see, but see!\r\n\r\n Enter Sir Andrew.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nMore matter for a May morning.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nHere’s the challenge, read it. I warrant there’s vinegar and pepper\r\nin’t.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nIs’t so saucy?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAy, is’t, I warrant him. Do but read.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nGive me. [_Reads._] _Youth, whatsoever thou art, thou art but a scurvy\r\nfellow._\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nGood, and valiant.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n_Wonder not, nor admire not in thy mind, why I do call thee so, for I\r\nwill show thee no reason for’t._\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nA good note, that keeps you from the blow of the law.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n_Thou comest to the Lady Olivia, and in my sight she uses thee kindly:\r\nbut thou liest in thy throat; that is not the matter I challenge thee\r\nfor._\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nVery brief, and to exceeding good sense—less.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n_I will waylay thee going home; where if it be thy chance to kill me—_\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nGood.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n_Thou kill’st me like a rogue and a villain._\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nStill you keep o’ th’ windy side of the law. Good.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n_Fare thee well, and God have mercy upon one of our souls! He may have\r\nmercy upon mine, but my hope is better, and so look to thyself. Thy\r\nfriend, as thou usest him, and thy sworn enemy,\r\n Andrew Aguecheek._\r\nIf this letter move him not, his legs cannot. I’ll give’t him.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nYou may have very fit occasion for’t. He is now in some commerce with\r\nmy lady, and will by and by depart.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nGo, Sir Andrew. Scout me for him at the corner of the orchard, like a\r\nbum-baily. So soon as ever thou seest him, draw, and as thou draw’st,\r\nswear horrible, for it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath, with a\r\nswaggering accent sharply twanged off, gives manhood more approbation\r\nthan ever proof itself would have earned him. Away.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nNay, let me alone for swearing.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nNow will not I deliver his letter, for the behaviour of the young\r\ngentleman gives him out to be of good capacity and breeding; his\r\nemployment between his lord and my niece confirms no less. Therefore\r\nthis letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no terror in the\r\nyouth. He will find it comes from a clodpole. But, sir, I will deliver\r\nhis challenge by word of mouth, set upon Aguecheek notable report of\r\nvalour, and drive the gentleman (as I know his youth will aptly receive\r\nit) into a most hideous opinion of his rage, skill, fury, and\r\nimpetuosity. This will so fright them both that they will kill one\r\nanother by the look, like cockatrices.\r\n\r\n Enter Olivia and Viola.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nHere he comes with your niece; give them way till he take leave, and\r\npresently after him.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nI will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challenge.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Sir Toby, Fabian and Maria._]\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nI have said too much unto a heart of stone,\r\nAnd laid mine honour too unchary on’t:\r\nThere’s something in me that reproves my fault:\r\nBut such a headstrong potent fault it is,\r\nThat it but mocks reproof.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nWith the same ’haviour that your passion bears\r\nGoes on my master’s griefs.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nHere, wear this jewel for me, ’tis my picture.\r\nRefuse it not, it hath no tongue to vex you.\r\nAnd I beseech you come again tomorrow.\r\nWhat shall you ask of me that I’ll deny,\r\nThat honour sav’d, may upon asking give?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nNothing but this, your true love for my master.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nHow with mine honour may I give him that\r\nWhich I have given to you?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI will acquit you.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWell, come again tomorrow. Fare thee well;\r\nA fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\n Enter Sir Toby and Fabian.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nGentleman, God save thee.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nAnd you, sir.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nThat defence thou hast, betake thee to’t. Of what nature the wrongs are\r\nthou hast done him, I know not, but thy intercepter, full of despite,\r\nbloody as the hunter, attends thee at the orchard end. Dismount thy\r\ntuck, be yare in thy preparation, for thy assailant is quick, skilful,\r\nand deadly.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nYou mistake, sir; I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me. My\r\nremembrance is very free and clear from any image of offence done to\r\nany man.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nYou’ll find it otherwise, I assure you. Therefore, if you hold your\r\nlife at any price, betake you to your guard, for your opposite hath in\r\nhim what youth, strength, skill, and wrath, can furnish man withal.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI pray you, sir, what is he?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nHe is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier, and on carpet\r\nconsideration, but he is a devil in private brawl. Souls and bodies\r\nhath he divorced three, and his incensement at this moment is so\r\nimplacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and\r\nsepulchre. Hob, nob is his word; give’t or take’t.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady.\r\nI am no fighter. I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels\r\npurposely on others to taste their valour: belike this is a man of that\r\nquirk.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nSir, no. His indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury;\r\ntherefore, get you on and give him his desire. Back you shall not to\r\nthe house, unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety\r\nyou might answer him. Therefore on, or strip your sword stark naked,\r\nfor meddle you must, that’s certain, or forswear to wear iron about\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nThis is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do me this courteous\r\noffice, as to know of the knight what my offence to him is. It is\r\nsomething of my negligence, nothing of my purpose.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nI will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this gentleman till my\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Sir Toby._]\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nPray you, sir, do you know of this matter?\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nI know the knight is incensed against you, even to a mortal\r\narbitrement, but nothing of the circumstance more.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI beseech you, what manner of man is he?\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nNothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by his form, as you are\r\nlike to find him in the proof of his valour. He is indeed, sir, the\r\nmost skilful, bloody, and fatal opposite that you could possibly have\r\nfound in any part of Illyria. Will you walk towards him? I will make\r\nyour peace with him if I can.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI shall be much bound to you for’t. I am one that had rather go with\r\nsir priest than sir knight: I care not who knows so much of my mettle.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\n Enter Sir Toby and Sir Andrew.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhy, man, he’s a very devil. I have not seen such a firago. I had a\r\npass with him, rapier, scabbard, and all, and he gives me the stuck-in\r\nwith such a mortal motion that it is inevitable; and on the answer, he\r\npays you as surely as your feet hits the ground they step on. They say\r\nhe has been fencer to the Sophy.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nPox on’t, I’ll not meddle with him.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nAy, but he will not now be pacified: Fabian can scarce hold him yonder.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nPlague on’t, an I thought he had been valiant, and so cunning in fence,\r\nI’d have seen him damned ere I’d have challenged him. Let him let the\r\nmatter slip, and I’ll give him my horse, grey Capilet.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nI’ll make the motion. Stand here, make a good show on’t. This shall end\r\nwithout the perdition of souls. [_Aside._] Marry, I’ll ride your horse\r\nas well as I ride you.\r\n\r\n Enter Fabian and Viola.\r\n\r\n[_To Fabian._] I have his horse to take up the quarrel. I have\r\npersuaded him the youth’s a devil.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nHe is as horribly conceited of him, and pants and looks pale, as if a\r\nbear were at his heels.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nThere’s no remedy, sir, he will fight with you for’s oath sake. Marry,\r\nhe hath better bethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that now\r\nscarce to be worth talking of. Therefore, draw for the supportance of\r\nhis vow; he protests he will not hurt you.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\n[_Aside._] Pray God defend me! A little thing would make me tell them\r\nhow much I lack of a man.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nGive ground if you see him furious.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nCome, Sir Andrew, there’s no remedy, the gentleman will for his\r\nhonour’s sake have one bout with you. He cannot by the duello avoid it;\r\nbut he has promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he will not\r\nhurt you. Come on: to’t.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\n[_Draws._] Pray God he keep his oath!\r\n\r\n Enter Antonio.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\n[_Draws._] I do assure you ’tis against my will.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nPut up your sword. If this young gentleman\r\nHave done offence, I take the fault on me.\r\nIf you offend him, I for him defy you.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nYou, sir? Why, what are you?\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\n[_Draws._] One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more\r\nThan you have heard him brag to you he will.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n[_Draws._] Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.\r\n\r\n Enter Officers.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nO good Sir Toby, hold! Here come the officers.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n[_To Antonio._] I’ll be with you anon.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\n[_To Sir Andrew._] Pray, sir, put your sword up, if you please.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nMarry, will I, sir; and for that I promised you, I’ll be as good as my\r\nword. He will bear you easily, and reins well.\r\n\r\nFIRST OFFICER.\r\nThis is the man; do thy office.\r\n\r\nSECOND OFFICER.\r\nAntonio, I arrest thee at the suit\r\nOf Count Orsino.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nYou do mistake me, sir.\r\n\r\nFIRST OFFICER.\r\nNo, sir, no jot. I know your favour well,\r\nThough now you have no sea-cap on your head.—\r\nTake him away, he knows I know him well.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nI must obey. This comes with seeking you;\r\nBut there’s no remedy, I shall answer it.\r\nWhat will you do? Now my necessity\r\nMakes me to ask you for my purse. It grieves me\r\nMuch more for what I cannot do for you,\r\nThan what befalls myself. You stand amaz’d,\r\nBut be of comfort.\r\n\r\nSECOND OFFICER.\r\nCome, sir, away.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nI must entreat of you some of that money.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nWhat money, sir?\r\nFor the fair kindness you have show’d me here,\r\nAnd part being prompted by your present trouble,\r\nOut of my lean and low ability\r\nI’ll lend you something. My having is not much;\r\nI’ll make division of my present with you.\r\nHold, there’s half my coffer.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nWill you deny me now?\r\nIs’t possible that my deserts to you\r\nCan lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery,\r\nLest that it make me so unsound a man\r\nAs to upbraid you with those kindnesses\r\nThat I have done for you.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI know of none,\r\nNor know I you by voice or any feature.\r\nI hate ingratitude more in a man\r\nThan lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness,\r\nOr any taint of vice whose strong corruption\r\nInhabits our frail blood.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nO heavens themselves!\r\n\r\nSECOND OFFICER.\r\nCome, sir, I pray you go.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nLet me speak a little. This youth that you see here\r\nI snatch’d one half out of the jaws of death,\r\nReliev’d him with such sanctity of love;\r\nAnd to his image, which methought did promise\r\nMost venerable worth, did I devotion.\r\n\r\nFIRST OFFICER.\r\nWhat’s that to us? The time goes by. Away!\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nBut O how vile an idol proves this god!\r\nThou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame.\r\nIn nature there’s no blemish but the mind;\r\nNone can be call’d deform’d but the unkind.\r\nVirtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil\r\nAre empty trunks, o’erflourished by the devil.\r\n\r\nFIRST OFFICER.\r\nThe man grows mad, away with him. Come, come, sir.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nLead me on.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Officers with Antonio._]\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nMethinks his words do from such passion fly\r\nThat he believes himself; so do not I.\r\nProve true, imagination, O prove true,\r\nThat I, dear brother, be now ta’en for you!\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nCome hither, knight; come hither, Fabian. We’ll whisper o’er a couplet\r\nor two of most sage saws.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nHe nam’d Sebastian. I my brother know\r\nYet living in my glass; even such and so\r\nIn favour was my brother, and he went\r\nStill in this fashion, colour, ornament,\r\nFor him I imitate. O if it prove,\r\nTempests are kind, and salt waves fresh in love!\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nA very dishonest paltry boy, and more a coward than a hare. His\r\ndishonesty appears in leaving his friend here in necessity, and denying\r\nhim; and for his cowardship, ask Fabian.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nA coward, a most devout coward, religious in it.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\n’Slid, I’ll after him again and beat him.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nDo, cuff him soundly, but never draw thy sword.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAnd I do not—\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nCome, let’s see the event.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nI dare lay any money ’twill be nothing yet.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\nACT IV.\r\n\r\nSCENE I. The Street before Olivia’s House.\r\n\n Enter Sebastian and Clown.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWill you make me believe that I am not sent for you?\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nGo to, go to, thou art a foolish fellow.\r\nLet me be clear of thee.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWell held out, i’ faith! No, I do not know you, nor I am not sent to\r\nyou by my lady, to bid you come speak with her; nor your name is not\r\nMaster Cesario; nor this is not my nose neither. Nothing that is so, is\r\nso.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nI prithee vent thy folly somewhere else,\r\nThou know’st not me.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nVent my folly! He has heard that word of some great man, and now\r\napplies it to a fool. Vent my folly! I am afraid this great lubber, the\r\nworld, will prove a cockney. I prithee now, ungird thy strangeness, and\r\ntell me what I shall vent to my lady. Shall I vent to her that thou art\r\ncoming?\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nI prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me.\r\nThere’s money for thee; if you tarry longer\r\nI shall give worse payment.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nBy my troth, thou hast an open hand. These wise men that give fools\r\nmoney get themselves a good report—after fourteen years’ purchase.\r\n\r\n Enter Sir Andrew, Sir Toby and Fabian.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nNow sir, have I met you again? There’s for you.\r\n\r\n [_Striking Sebastian._]\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nWhy, there’s for thee, and there, and there.\r\nAre all the people mad?\r\n\r\n [_Beating Sir Andrew._]\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nHold, sir, or I’ll throw your dagger o’er the house.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nThis will I tell my lady straight. I would not be in some of your coats\r\nfor twopence.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Clown._]\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nCome on, sir, hold!\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nNay, let him alone, I’ll go another way to work with him. I’ll have an\r\naction of battery against him, if there be any law in Illyria. Though I\r\nstruck him first, yet it’s no matter for that.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nLet go thy hand!\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nCome, sir, I will not let you go. Come, my young soldier, put up your\r\niron: you are well fleshed. Come on.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nI will be free from thee. What wouldst thou now?\r\nIf thou dar’st tempt me further, draw thy sword.\r\n\r\n [_Draws._]\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhat, what? Nay, then, I must have an ounce or two of this malapert\r\nblood from you.\r\n\r\n [_Draws._]\r\n\r\n Enter Olivia.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nHold, Toby! On thy life I charge thee hold!\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nMadam.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWill it be ever thus? Ungracious wretch,\r\nFit for the mountains and the barbarous caves,\r\nWhere manners ne’er were preach’d! Out of my sight!\r\nBe not offended, dear Cesario.\r\nRudesby, be gone!\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Sir Toby, Sir Andrew and Fabian._]\r\n\r\nI prithee, gentle friend,\r\nLet thy fair wisdom, not thy passion, sway\r\nIn this uncivil and unjust extent\r\nAgainst thy peace. Go with me to my house,\r\nAnd hear thou there how many fruitless pranks\r\nThis ruffian hath botch’d up, that thou thereby\r\nMayst smile at this. Thou shalt not choose but go.\r\nDo not deny. Beshrew his soul for me,\r\nHe started one poor heart of mine, in thee.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nWhat relish is in this? How runs the stream?\r\nOr I am mad, or else this is a dream.\r\nLet fancy still my sense in Lethe steep;\r\nIf it be thus to dream, still let me sleep!\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nNay, come, I prithee. Would thou’dst be ruled by me!\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nMadam, I will.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nO, say so, and so be!\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. A Room in Olivia’s House.\r\n\r\n Enter Maria and Clown.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nNay, I prithee, put on this gown and this beard; make him believe thou\r\nart Sir Topas the curate. Do it quickly. I’ll call Sir Toby the whilst.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Maria._]\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWell, I’ll put it on, and I will dissemble myself in’t, and I would I\r\nwere the first that ever dissembled in such a gown. I am not tall\r\nenough to become the function well, nor lean enough to be thought a\r\ngood student, but to be said, an honest man and a good housekeeper goes\r\nas fairly as to say, a careful man and a great scholar. The competitors\r\nenter.\r\n\r\n Enter Sir Toby and Maria.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nJove bless thee, Master Parson.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\n_Bonos dies_, Sir Toby: for as the old hermit of Prague, that never saw\r\npen and ink, very wittily said to a niece of King Gorboduc, ‘That that\r\nis, is’: so I, being Master Parson, am Master Parson; for what is\r\n‘that’ but ‘that’? and ‘is’ but ‘is’?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nTo him, Sir Topas.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWhat ho, I say! Peace in this prison!\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nThe knave counterfeits well. A good knave.\r\n\r\nMalvolio within.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nWho calls there?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nSir Topas the curate, who comes to visit Malvolio the lunatic.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nSir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go to my lady.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nOut, hyperbolical fiend! how vexest thou this man? Talkest thou nothing\r\nbut of ladies?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWell said, Master Parson.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nSir Topas, never was man thus wronged. Good Sir Topas, do not think I\r\nam mad. They have laid me here in hideous darkness.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nFie, thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the most modest terms, for I\r\nam one of those gentle ones that will use the devil himself with\r\ncourtesy. Say’st thou that house is dark?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nAs hell, Sir Topas.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWhy, it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes, and the\r\nclerestories toward the south-north are as lustrous as ebony; and yet\r\ncomplainest thou of obstruction?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nI am not mad, Sir Topas. I say to you this house is dark.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nMadman, thou errest. I say there is no darkness but ignorance, in which\r\nthou art more puzzled than the Egyptians in their fog.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nI say this house is as dark as ignorance, though ignorance were as dark\r\nas hell; and I say there was never man thus abused. I am no more mad\r\nthan you are. Make the trial of it in any constant question.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWhat is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wildfowl?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nThat the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWhat think’st thou of his opinion?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nI think nobly of the soul, and no way approve his opinion.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nFare thee well. Remain thou still in darkness. Thou shalt hold the\r\nopinion of Pythagoras ere I will allow of thy wits, and fear to kill a\r\nwoodcock, lest thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam.

He sees thee\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nTo him in thine own voice, and bring me word how thou find’st him. I\r\nwould we were well rid of this knavery. If he may be conveniently\r\ndelivered, I would he were, for I am now so far in offence with my\r\nniece that I cannot pursue with any safety this sport to the upshot.\r\nCome by and by to my chamber.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Sir Toby and Maria._]\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\n[_Singing._]\r\n _Hey, Robin, jolly Robin,\r\n Tell me how thy lady does._\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nFool!\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\n _My lady is unkind, perdy._\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nFool!\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\n _Alas, why is she so?_\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nFool, I say!\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\n _She loves another_—\r\nWho calls, ha?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nGood fool, as ever thou wilt deserve well at my hand, help me to a\r\ncandle, and pen, ink, and paper.

Where’s Antonio, then?\r\nI could not find him at the Elephant,\r\nYet there he was, and there I found this credit,\r\nThat he did range the town to seek me out.\r\nHis counsel now might do me golden service.\r\nFor though my soul disputes well with my sense\r\nThat this may be some error, but no madness,\r\nYet doth this accident and flood of fortune\r\nSo far exceed all instance, all discourse,\r\nThat I am ready to distrust mine eyes\r\nAnd wrangle with my reason that persuades me\r\nTo any other trust but that I am mad,\r\nOr else the lady’s mad; yet if ’twere so,\r\nShe could not sway her house, command her followers,\r\nTake and give back affairs and their dispatch,\r\nWith such a smooth, discreet, and stable bearing\r\nAs I perceive she does.

Now my foes tell me\r\nplainly I am an ass: so that by my foes, sir, I profit in the knowledge\r\nof myself, and by my friends I am abused. So that, conclusions to be as\r\nkisses, if your four negatives make your two affirmatives, why then,\r\nthe worse for my friends, and the better for my foes.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWhy, this is excellent.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nBy my troth, sir, no; though it please you to be one of my friends.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThou shalt not be the worse for me; there’s gold.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nBut that it would be double-dealing, sir, I would you could make it\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nO, you give me ill counsel.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nPut your grace in your pocket, sir, for this once, and let your flesh\r\nand blood obey it.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWell, I will be so much a sinner to be a double-dealer: there’s\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\n_Primo, secundo, tertio_, is a good play, and the old saying is, the\r\nthird pays for all; the triplex, sir, is a good tripping measure; or\r\nthe bells of Saint Bennet, sir, may put you in mind—one, two, three.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nYou can fool no more money out of me at this throw.

A witchcraft drew me hither:\r\nThat most ingrateful boy there by your side\r\nFrom the rude sea’s enraged and foamy mouth\r\nDid I redeem; a wreck past hope he was.\r\nHis life I gave him, and did thereto add\r\nMy love, without retention or restraint,\r\nAll his in dedication. For his sake\r\nDid I expose myself, pure for his love,\r\nInto the danger of this adverse town;\r\nDrew to defend him when he was beset;\r\nWhere being apprehended, his false cunning\r\n(Not meaning to partake with me in danger)\r\nTaught him to face me out of his acquaintance,\r\nAnd grew a twenty years’ removed thing\r\nWhile one would wink; denied me mine own purse,\r\nWhich I had recommended to his use\r\nNot half an hour before.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nHow can this be?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWhen came he to this town?\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nToday, my lord; and for three months before,\r\nNo int’rim, not a minute’s vacancy,\r\nBoth day and night did we keep company.\r\n\r\n Enter Olivia and Attendants.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nHere comes the Countess, now heaven walks on earth.\r\nBut for thee, fellow, fellow, thy words are madness.\r\nThree months this youth hath tended upon me;\r\nBut more of that anon. Take him aside.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhat would my lord, but that he may not have,\r\nWherein Olivia may seem serviceable?\r\nCesario, you do not keep promise with me.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nMadam?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nGracious Olivia—\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhat do you say, Cesario?

You uncivil lady,\r\nTo whose ingrate and unauspicious altars\r\nMy soul the faithfull’st off’rings hath breathed out\r\nThat e’er devotion tender’d! What shall I do?\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nEven what it please my lord that shall become him.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWhy should I not, had I the heart to do it,\r\nLike to the Egyptian thief at point of death,\r\nKill what I love?—a savage jealousy\r\nThat sometime savours nobly. But hear me this:\r\nSince you to non-regardance cast my faith,\r\nAnd that I partly know the instrument\r\nThat screws me from my true place in your favour,\r\nLive you the marble-breasted tyrant still.\r\nBut this your minion, whom I know you love,\r\nAnd whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,\r\nHim will I tear out of that cruel eye\r\nWhere he sits crowned in his master’s spite.—\r\nCome, boy, with me; my thoughts are ripe in mischief:\r\nI’ll sacrifice the lamb that I do love,\r\nTo spite a raven’s heart within a dove.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nAnd I, most jocund, apt, and willingly,\r\nTo do you rest, a thousand deaths would die.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhere goes Cesario?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nAfter him I love\r\nMore than I love these eyes, more than my life,\r\nMore, by all mores, than e’er I shall love wife.\r\nIf I do feign, you witnesses above\r\nPunish my life for tainting of my love.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nAh me, detested! how am I beguil’d!\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nWho does beguile you?

What wilt thou be\r\nWhen time hath sowed a grizzle on thy case?\r\nOr will not else thy craft so quickly grow\r\nThat thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?\r\nFarewell, and take her; but direct thy feet\r\nWhere thou and I henceforth may never meet.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nMy lord, I do protest—\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nO, do not swear.\r\nHold little faith, though thou has too much fear.\r\n\r\n Enter Sir Andrew.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nFor the love of God, a surgeon! Send one presently to Sir Toby.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhat’s the matter?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\n’Has broke my head across, and has given Sir Toby a bloody coxcomb too.\r\nFor the love of God, your help! I had rather than forty pound I were at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWho has done this, Sir Andrew?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nThe Count’s gentleman, one Cesario. We took him for a coward, but he’s\r\nthe very devil incardinate.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nMy gentleman, Cesario?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\n’Od’s lifelings, here he is!—You broke my head for nothing; and that\r\nthat I did, I was set on to do’t by Sir Toby.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nWhy do you speak to me? I never hurt you:\r\nYou drew your sword upon me without cause,\r\nBut I bespake you fair and hurt you not.\r\n\r\n Enter Sir Toby, drunk, led by the Clown.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nIf a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me. I think you set\r\nnothing by a bloody coxcomb. Here comes Sir Toby halting, you shall\r\nhear more: but if he had not been in drink, he would have tickled you\r\nothergates than he did.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nHow now, gentleman? How is’t with you?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nThat’s all one; ’has hurt me, and there’s th’ end on’t. Sot, didst see\r\nDick Surgeon, sot?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nO, he’s drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone; his eyes were set at eight i’\r\nth’ morning.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nThen he’s a rogue, and a passy measures pavin. I hate a drunken rogue.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nAway with him. Who hath made this havoc with them?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nI’ll help you, Sir Toby, because we’ll be dressed together.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWill you help? An ass-head, and a coxcomb, and a knave, a thin-faced\r\nknave, a gull?\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nGet him to bed, and let his hurt be looked to.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Clown, Fabian, Sir Toby and Sir Andrew._]\r\n\r\n Enter Sebastian.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nI am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman;\r\nBut had it been the brother of my blood,\r\nI must have done no less with wit and safety.\r\nYou throw a strange regard upon me, and by that\r\nI do perceive it hath offended you.\r\nPardon me, sweet one, even for the vows\r\nWe made each other but so late ago.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nOne face, one voice, one habit, and two persons!\r\nA natural perspective, that is, and is not!\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nAntonio, O my dear Antonio!\r\nHow have the hours rack’d and tortur’d me\r\nSince I have lost thee.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nSebastian are you?\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nFear’st thou that, Antonio?\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nHow have you made division of yourself?\r\nAn apple cleft in two is not more twin\r\nThan these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nMost wonderful!\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nDo I stand there? I never had a brother:\r\nNor can there be that deity in my nature\r\nOf here and everywhere. I had a sister,\r\nWhom the blind waves and surges have devoured.\r\nOf charity, what kin are you to me?\r\nWhat countryman? What name? What parentage?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nOf Messaline: Sebastian was my father;\r\nSuch a Sebastian was my brother too:\r\nSo went he suited to his watery tomb.\r\nIf spirits can assume both form and suit,\r\nYou come to fright us.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nA spirit I am indeed,\r\nBut am in that dimension grossly clad,\r\nWhich from the womb I did participate.\r\nWere you a woman, as the rest goes even,\r\nI should my tears let fall upon your cheek,\r\nAnd say, ‘Thrice welcome, drowned Viola.’\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nMy father had a mole upon his brow.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nAnd so had mine.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nAnd died that day when Viola from her birth\r\nHad numbered thirteen years.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nO, that record is lively in my soul!\r\nHe finished indeed his mortal act\r\nThat day that made my sister thirteen years.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nIf nothing lets to make us happy both\r\nBut this my masculine usurp’d attire,\r\nDo not embrace me till each circumstance\r\nOf place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump\r\nThat I am Viola; which to confirm,\r\nI’ll bring you to a captain in this town,\r\nWhere lie my maiden weeds; by whose gentle help\r\nI was preserv’d to serve this noble count.\r\nAll the occurrence of my fortune since\r\nHath been between this lady and this lord.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\n[_To Olivia._] So comes it, lady, you have been mistook.\r\nBut nature to her bias drew in that.\r\nYou would have been contracted to a maid;\r\nNor are you therein, by my life, deceived:\r\nYou are betroth’d both to a maid and man.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nBe not amazed; right noble is his blood.\r\nIf this be so, as yet the glass seems true,\r\nI shall have share in this most happy wreck.\r\n[_To Viola._] Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times\r\nThou never shouldst love woman like to me.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nAnd all those sayings will I over-swear,\r\nAnd all those swearings keep as true in soul\r\nAs doth that orbed continent the fire\r\nThat severs day from night.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nGive me thy hand,\r\nAnd let me see thee in thy woman’s weeds.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nThe captain that did bring me first on shore\r\nHath my maid’s garments. He, upon some action,\r\nIs now in durance, at Malvolio’s suit,\r\nA gentleman and follower of my lady’s.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nHe shall enlarge him. Fetch Malvolio hither.\r\nAnd yet, alas, now I remember me,\r\nThey say, poor gentleman, he’s much distract.\r\n\r\n Enter Clown, with a letter and Fabian.\r\n\r\nA most extracting frenzy of mine own\r\nFrom my remembrance clearly banished his.\r\nHow does he, sirrah?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nTruly, madam, he holds Belzebub at the stave’s end as well as a man in\r\nhis case may do. Has here writ a letter to you. I should have given it\r\nyou today morning, but as a madman’s epistles are no gospels, so it\r\nskills not much when they are delivered.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nOpen ’t, and read it.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nLook then to be well edified, when the fool delivers the madman. _By\r\nthe Lord, madam,—_\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nHow now, art thou mad?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNo, madam, I do but read madness: an your ladyship will have it as it\r\nought to be, you must allow _vox_.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nPrithee, read i’ thy right wits.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nSo I do, madonna.

I have your own letter that induced me to the semblance I put\r\non; with the which I doubt not but to do myself much right or you much\r\nshame. Think of me as you please. I leave my duty a little unthought\r\nof, and speak out of my injury.\r\n The madly-used Malvolio._\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nDid he write this?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nAy, madam.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThis savours not much of distraction.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nSee him delivered, Fabian, bring him hither.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Fabian._]\r\n\r\nMy lord, so please you, these things further thought on,\r\nTo think me as well a sister, as a wife,\r\nOne day shall crown th’ alliance on’t, so please you,\r\nHere at my house, and at my proper cost.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nMadam, I am most apt t’ embrace your offer.\r\n[_To Viola._] Your master quits you; and for your service done him,\r\nSo much against the mettle of your sex,\r\nSo far beneath your soft and tender breeding,\r\nAnd since you call’d me master for so long,\r\nHere is my hand; you shall from this time be\r\nYour master’s mistress.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nA sister? You are she.\r\n\r\n Enter Fabian and Malvolio.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nIs this the madman?\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nAy, my lord, this same.\r\nHow now, Malvolio?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nMadam, you have done me wrong,\r\nNotorious wrong.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nHave I, Malvolio? No.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nLady, you have. Pray you peruse that letter.\r\nYou must not now deny it is your hand,\r\nWrite from it, if you can, in hand, or phrase,\r\nOr say ’tis not your seal, not your invention:\r\nYou can say none of this. Well, grant it then,\r\nAnd tell me, in the modesty of honour,\r\nWhy you have given me such clear lights of favour,\r\nBade me come smiling and cross-garter’d to you,\r\nTo put on yellow stockings, and to frown\r\nUpon Sir Toby, and the lighter people;\r\nAnd acting this in an obedient hope,\r\nWhy have you suffer’d me to be imprison’d,\r\nKept in a dark house, visited by the priest,\r\nAnd made the most notorious geck and gull\r\nThat e’er invention played on? Tell me why?\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nAlas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,\r\nThough I confess, much like the character:\r\nBut out of question, ’tis Maria’s hand.\r\nAnd now I do bethink me, it was she\r\nFirst told me thou wast mad; then cam’st in smiling,\r\nAnd in such forms which here were presuppos’d\r\nUpon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content.\r\nThis practice hath most shrewdly pass’d upon thee.\r\nBut when we know the grounds and authors of it,\r\nThou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge\r\nOf thine own cause.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nGood madam, hear me speak,\r\nAnd let no quarrel, nor no brawl to come,\r\nTaint the condition of this present hour,\r\nWhich I have wonder’d at. In hope it shall not,\r\nMost freely I confess, myself and Toby\r\nSet this device against Malvolio here,\r\nUpon some stubborn and uncourteous parts\r\nWe had conceiv’d against him. Maria writ\r\nThe letter, at Sir Toby’s great importance,\r\nIn recompense whereof he hath married her.\r\nHow with a sportful malice it was follow’d\r\nMay rather pluck on laughter than revenge,\r\nIf that the injuries be justly weigh’d\r\nThat have on both sides passed.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nAlas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWhy, ‘some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have\r\ngreatness thrown upon them.’ I was one, sir, in this interlude, one Sir\r\nTopas, sir, but that’s all one. ‘By the Lord, fool, I am not mad.’ But\r\ndo you remember? ‘Madam, why laugh you at such a barren rascal? And you\r\nsmile not, he’s gagged’? And thus the whirligig of time brings in his\r\nrevenges.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nI’ll be revenged on the whole pack of you.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nHe hath been most notoriously abus’d.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nPursue him, and entreat him to a peace:\r\nHe hath not told us of the captain yet.\r\nWhen that is known, and golden time convents,\r\nA solemn combination shall be made\r\nOf our dear souls.—Meantime, sweet sister,\r\nWe will not part from hence.—Cesario, come:\r\nFor so you shall be while you are a man;\r\nBut when in other habits you are seen,\r\nOrsino’s mistress, and his fancy’s queen.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\n Clown sings.\r\n\r\n_ When that I was and a little tiny boy,\r\n With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,\r\n A foolish thing was but a toy,\r\n For the rain it raineth every day._\r\n\r\n_ But when I came to man’s estate,\r\n With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,\r\n ’Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate,\r\n For the rain it raineth every day._\r\n\r\n_ But when I came, alas, to wive,\r\n With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,\r\n By swaggering could I never thrive,\r\n For the rain it raineth every day._\r\n\r\n_ But when I came unto my beds,\r\n With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,\r\n With toss-pots still had drunken heads,\r\n For the rain it raineth every day._\r\n\r\n_ A great while ago the world begun,\r\n With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,\r\n But that’s all one, our play is done,\r\n And we’ll strive to please you every day._\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\nTHE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA\r\n\nContents\r\n\r\n ACT I\r\n Scene I.

Verona. An open place\r\n\nEnter Valentine and Proteus.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nCease to persuade, my loving Proteus.\r\nHome-keeping youth have ever homely wits.\r\nWere’t not affection chains thy tender days\r\nTo the sweet glances of thy honoured love,\r\nI rather would entreat thy company\r\nTo see the wonders of the world abroad\r\nThan, living dully sluggardized at home,\r\nWear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.\r\nBut since thou lov’st, love still, and thrive therein,\r\nEven as I would when I to love begin.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nWilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu.\r\nThink on thy Proteus when thou haply seest\r\nSome rare noteworthy object in thy travel.\r\nWish me partaker in thy happiness\r\nWhen thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,\r\nIf ever danger do environ thee,\r\nCommend thy grievance to my holy prayers,\r\nFor I will be thy headsman, Valentine.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nAnd on a love-book pray for my success?\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nUpon some book I love I’ll pray for thee.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nThat’s on some shallow story of deep love,\r\nHow young Leander crossed the Hellespont.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nThat’s a deep story of a deeper love,\r\nFor he was more than over shoes in love.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\n’Tis true; for you are over boots in love,\r\nAnd yet you never swam the Hellespont.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nOver the boots? Nay, give me not the boots.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nNo, I will not, for it boots thee not.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nWhat?\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nTo be in love, where scorn is bought with groans,\r\nCoy looks with heart-sore sighs, one fading moment’s mirth\r\nWith twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights.\r\nIf haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;\r\nIf lost, why then a grievous labour won;\r\nHowever, but a folly bought with wit,\r\nOr else a wit by folly vanquished.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nSo, by your circumstance, you call me fool.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nSo, by your circumstance, I fear you’ll prove.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\n’Tis love you cavil at. I am not Love.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nLove is your master, for he masters you;\r\nAnd he that is so yoked by a fool\r\nMethinks should not be chronicled for wise.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nYet writers say, as in the sweetest bud\r\nThe eating canker dwells, so eating love\r\nInhabits in the finest wits of all.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nAnd writers say, as the most forward bud\r\nIs eaten by the canker ere it blow,\r\nEven so by love the young and tender wit\r\nIs turned to folly, blasting in the bud,\r\nLosing his verdure even in the prime,\r\nAnd all the fair effects of future hopes.\r\nBut wherefore waste I time to counsel thee\r\nThat art a votary to fond desire?\r\nOnce more adieu. My father at the road\r\nExpects my coming, there to see me shipped.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nAnd thither will I bring thee, Valentine.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nSweet Proteus, no. Now let us take our leave.\r\nTo Milan let me hear from thee by letters\r\nOf thy success in love, and what news else\r\nBetideth here in absence of thy friend;\r\nAnd I likewise will visit thee with mine.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nAll happiness bechance to thee in Milan.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nAs much to you at home, and so farewell.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nHe after honour hunts, I after love.\r\nHe leaves his friends to dignify them more;\r\nI leave myself, my friends, and all for love.\r\nThou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me,\r\nMade me neglect my studies, lose my time,\r\nWar with good counsel, set the world at nought;\r\nMade wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.\r\n\r\nEnter Speed.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nSir Proteus, ’save you. Saw you my master?\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nBut now he parted hence to embark for Milan.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nTwenty to one, then, he is shipped already,\r\nAnd I have played the sheep in losing him.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nIndeed a sheep doth very often stray,\r\nAn if the shepherd be a while away.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nYou conclude that my master is a shepherd then, and I a sheep?\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nI do.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nWhy then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nA silly answer, and fitting well a sheep.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nThis proves me still a sheep.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nTrue, and thy master a shepherd.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nNay, that I can deny by a circumstance.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nIt shall go hard but I’ll prove it by another.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nThe shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the shepherd; but I\r\nseek my master, and my master seeks not me. Therefore I am no sheep.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nThe sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the shepherd for food follows\r\nnot the sheep. Thou for wages followest thy master; thy master for\r\nwages follows not thee. Therefore thou art a sheep.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nSuch another proof will make me cry “baa”.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nBut dost thou hear? Gav’st thou my letter to Julia?\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nAy, sir. I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her, a laced mutton, and\r\nshe, a laced mutton, gave me, a lost mutton, nothing for my labour.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nHere’s too small a pasture for such store of muttons.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nIf the ground be overcharged, you were best stick her.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nNay, in that you are astray; ’twere best pound you.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nNay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your letter.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nYou mistake; I mean the pound, a pinfold.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nFrom a pound to a pin? Fold it over and over,\r\n’Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nBut what said she?\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\n[_Nods his head_.] Ay.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nNod—“Ay”. Why, that’s “noddy”.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nYou mistook, sir. I say she did nod, and you ask me if she did nod; and\r\nI say “Ay”.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nAnd that set together is “noddy”.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nNow you have taken the pains to set it together, take it for your\r\npains.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nNo, no, you shall have it for bearing the letter.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nWell, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nWhy, sir, how do you bear with me?\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nMarry, sir, the letter, very orderly, having nothing but the word\r\n“noddy” for my pains.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nBeshrew me, but you have a quick wit.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nAnd yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nCome, come, open the matter; in brief, what said she?\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nOpen your purse, that the money and the matter may be both at once\r\ndelivered.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\n[_Giving him a coin_.] Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said\r\nshe?\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nTruly, sir, I think you’ll hardly win her.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nWhy? Couldst thou perceive so much from her?\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nSir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no, not so much as a\r\nducat for delivering your letter. And being so hard to me that brought\r\nyour mind, I fear she’ll prove as hard to you in telling your mind.\r\nGive her no token but stones, for she’s as hard as steel.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nWhat said she, nothing?\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nNo, not so much as “Take this for thy pains.” To testify your bounty, I\r\nthank you, you have testerned me; in requital whereof, henceforth carry\r\nyour letters yourself. And so, sir, I’ll commend you to my master.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nGo, go, begone, to save your ship from wrack,\r\nWhich cannot perish having thee aboard,\r\nBeing destined to a drier death on shore.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Speed._]\r\n\nI must go send some better messenger.\r\nI fear my Julia would not deign my lines,\r\nReceiving them from such a worthless post.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II.

Let me see what news.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nThere is no news, my lord, but that he writes\r\nHow happily he lives, how well beloved\r\nAnd daily graced by the Emperor,\r\nWishing me with him, partner of his fortune.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nAnd how stand you affected to his wish?\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nAs one relying on your lordship’s will,\r\nAnd not depending on his friendly wish.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nMy will is something sorted with his wish.\r\nMuse not that I thus suddenly proceed,\r\nFor what I will, I will, and there an end.\r\nI am resolved that thou shalt spend some time\r\nWith Valentinus in the Emperor’s court.\r\nWhat maintenance he from his friends receives,\r\nLike exhibition thou shalt have from me.\r\nTomorrow be in readiness to go.\r\nExcuse it not, for I am peremptory.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nMy lord, I cannot be so soon provided;\r\nPlease you deliberate a day or two.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nLook what thou want’st shall be sent after thee.\r\nNo more of stay. Tomorrow thou must go.\r\nCome on, Pantino, you shall be employed\r\nTo hasten on his expedition.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Antonio and Pantino._]\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nThus have I shunned the fire for fear of burning\r\nAnd drenched me in the sea, where I am drowned.\r\nI feared to show my father Julia’s letter\r\nLest he should take exceptions to my love,\r\nAnd with the vantage of mine own excuse\r\nHath he excepted most against my love.\r\nO, how this spring of love resembleth\r\nThe uncertain glory of an April day,\r\nWhich now shows all the beauty of the sun,\r\nAnd by an by a cloud takes all away.\r\n\r\nEnter Pantino.\r\n\r\nPANTINO.\r\nSir Proteus, your father calls for you.\r\nHe is in haste. Therefore, I pray you, go.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nWhy, this it is: my heart accords thereto,\r\nAnd yet a thousand times it answers “No”.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\nACT II\r\n\r\nSCENE I. Milan. A room in the Duke’s palace\r\n\nEnter Valentine and Speed.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nSir, your glove.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nNot mine. My gloves are on.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nWhy, then, this may be yours, for this is but one.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nHa? Let me see. Ay, give it me, it’s mine.\r\nSweet ornament that decks a thing divine!\r\nAh, Silvia, Silvia!\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\n[_Calling_.] Madam Silvia! Madam Silvia!\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nHow now, sirrah?\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nShe is not within hearing, sir.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nWhy, sir, who bade you call her?\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nYour worship, sir, or else I mistook.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nWell, you’ll still be too forward.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nAnd yet I was last chidden for being too slow.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nGo to, sir. Tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nShe that your worship loves?\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nWhy, how know you that I am in love?\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nMarry, by these special marks: first, you have learned, like Sir\r\nProteus, to wreathe your arms like a malcontent; to relish a love-song,\r\nlike a robin redbreast; to walk alone, like one that had the\r\npestilence; to sigh, like a schoolboy that had lost his ABC; to weep,\r\nlike a young wench that had buried her grandam; to fast, like one that\r\ntakes diet; to watch, like one that fears robbing; to speak puling,\r\nlike a beggar at Hallowmas. You were wont, when you laughed, to crow\r\nlike a cock; when you walked, to walk like one of the lions; when you\r\nfasted, it was presently after dinner; when you looked sadly, it was\r\nfor want of money. And now you are metamorphosed with a mistress, that,\r\nwhen I look on you, I can hardly think you my master.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nAre all these things perceived in me?\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nThey are all perceived without ye.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nWithout me? They cannot.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nWithout you? Nay, that’s certain, for without you were so simple, none\r\nelse would. But you are so without these follies, that these follies\r\nare within you, and shine through you like the water in an urinal, that\r\nnot an eye that sees you but is a physician to comment on your malady.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nBut tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nShe that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nHast thou observed that? Even she I mean.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nWhy, sir, I know her not.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nDost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet know’st her not?\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nIs she not hard-favoured, sir?\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nNot so fair, boy, as well-favoured.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nSir, I know that well enough.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nWhat dost thou know?\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nThat she is not so fair as, of you, well-favoured.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nI mean that her beauty is exquisite but her favour infinite.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nThat’s because the one is painted, and the other out of all count.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nHow painted? And how out of count?\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nMarry, sir, so painted to make her fair, that no man counts of her\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nHow esteem’st thou me? I account of her beauty.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nYou never saw her since she was deformed.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nHow long hath she been deformed?\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nEver since you loved her.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nI have loved her ever since I saw her, and still I see her beautiful.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nIf you love her, you cannot see her.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nBecause Love is blind. O, that you had mine eyes, or your own eyes had\r\nthe lights they were wont to have when you chid at Sir Proteus for\r\ngoing ungartered!\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nWhat should I see then?\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nYour own present folly and her passing deformity; for he, being in\r\nlove, could not see to garter his hose; and you, being in love, cannot\r\nsee to put on your hose.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nBelike, boy, then you are in love, for last morning you could not see\r\nto wipe my shoes.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nTrue, sir, I was in love with my bed. I thank you, you swinged me for\r\nmy love, which makes me the bolder to chide you for yours.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nIn conclusion, I stand affected to her.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nI would you were set, so your affection would cease.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nLast night she enjoined me to write some lines to one she loves.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nAnd have you?\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nI have.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nAre they not lamely writ?\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nNo, boy, but as well as I can do them.\r\nPeace, here she comes.\r\n\r\nEnter Silvia.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\n[_Aside_.] O excellent motion! O exceeding puppet!\r\nNow will he interpret to her.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nMadam and mistress, a thousand good-morrows.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\n[_Aside_.] O, give ye good e’en! Here’s a million of manners.\r\n\r\nSILVIA.\r\nSir Valentine and servant, to you two thousand.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\n[_Aside_.] He should give her interest, and she gives it him.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nAs you enjoined me, I have writ your letter\r\nUnto the secret nameless friend of yours,\r\nWhich I was much unwilling to proceed in\r\nBut for my duty to your ladyship.\r\n\r\n[_Gives her a letter._]\r\n\r\nSILVIA.\r\nI thank you, gentle servant, ’tis very clerkly done.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nNow trust me, madam, it came hardly off,\r\nFor, being ignorant to whom it goes,\r\nI writ at random, very doubtfully.\r\n\r\nSILVIA.\r\nPerchance you think too much of so much pains?\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nNo, madam; so it stead you, I will write,\r\nPlease you command, a thousand times as much.\r\nAnd yet—\r\n\r\nSILVIA.\r\nA pretty period. Well, I guess the sequel;\r\nAnd yet I will not name it. And yet I care not.\r\nAnd yet take this again.\r\n\r\n[_Offers him the letter._]\r\n\r\nAnd yet I thank you,\r\nMeaning henceforth to trouble you no more.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\n[_Aside_.] And yet you will; and yet another “yet”.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nWhat means your ladyship? Do you not like it?\r\n\r\nSILVIA.\r\nYes, yes, the lines are very quaintly writ,\r\nBut, since unwillingly, take them again.\r\nNay, take them.\r\n\r\n[_Offers the letter again._]\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nMadam, they are for you.\r\n\r\nSILVIA.\r\nAy, ay, you writ them, sir, at my request,\r\nBut I will none of them. They are for you.\r\nI would have had them writ more movingly.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nPlease you, I’ll write your ladyship another.\r\n\r\nSILVIA.\r\nAnd when it’s writ, for my sake read it over,\r\nAnd if it please you, so; if not, why, so.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nIf it please me, madam? What then?\r\n\r\nSILVIA.\r\nWhy, if it please you, take it for your labour.\r\nAnd so good morrow, servant.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\n[_Aside_.] O jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible,\r\nAs a nose on a man’s face, or a weathercock on a steeple!\r\nMy master sues to her, and she hath taught her suitor,\r\nHe being her pupil, to become her tutor.\r\nO excellent device! Was there ever heard a better?\r\nThat my master, being scribe, to himself should write the letter?\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nHow now, sir? What are you reasoning with yourself?\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nNay, I was rhyming. ’Tis you that have the reason.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nTo do what?\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nTo be a spokesman from Madam Silvia.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nTo whom?\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nTo yourself. Why, she woos you by a figure.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nWhat figure?\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nBy a letter, I should say.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nWhy, she hath not writ to me.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nWhat need she, when she hath made you write to yourself? Why, do you\r\nnot perceive the jest?\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nNo, believe me.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nNo believing you indeed, sir. But did you perceive her earnest?\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nShe gave me none, except an angry word.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nWhy, she hath given you a letter.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nThat’s the letter I writ to her friend.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nAnd that letter hath she delivered, and there an end.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nI would it were no worse.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nI’ll warrant you, ’tis as well.\r\nFor often have you writ to her, and she, in modesty\r\nOr else for want of idle time, could not again reply,\r\nOr fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover,\r\nHerself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover.\r\nAll this I speak in print, for in print I found it. Why muse you, sir?\r\n’Tis dinner time.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nI have dined.\r\n\r\nSPEED.\r\nAy, but hearken, sir, though the chameleon Love can feed on the air, I\r\nam one that am nourished by my victuals, and would fain have meat. O,\r\nbe not like your mistress! Be moved, be moved.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. Verona. A room in Julia’s house\r\n\r\nEnter Proteus and Julia.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nHave patience, gentle Julia.\r\n\r\nJULIA.\r\nI must, where is no remedy.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nWhen possibly I can, I will return.\r\n\r\nJULIA.\r\nIf you turn not, you will return the sooner.\r\nKeep this remembrance for thy Julia’s sake.\r\n\r\n[_Gives him a ring._]\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nWhy, then we’ll make exchange.

The same. A street\r\n\r\nEnter Lance with his dog Crab.\r\n\r\nLANCE.\r\nNay, ’twill be this hour ere I have done weeping; all the kind of the\r\nLances have this very fault. I have received my proportion, like the\r\nprodigious son, and am going with Sir Proteus to the Imperial’s court.\r\nI think Crab my dog be the sourest-natured dog that lives: my mother\r\nweeping, my father wailing, my sister crying, our maid howling, our cat\r\nwringing her hands, and all our house in a great perplexity, yet did\r\nnot this cruel-hearted cur shed one tear. He is a stone, a very\r\npebblestone, and has no more pity in him than a dog. A Jew would have\r\nwept to have seen our parting. Why, my grandam, having no eyes, look\r\nyou, wept herself blind at my parting. Nay, I’ll show you the manner of\r\nit. This shoe is my father. No, this left shoe is my father; no, no,\r\nthis left shoe is my mother. Nay, that cannot be so neither. Yes, it is\r\nso, it is so; it hath the worser sole. This shoe with the hole in it is\r\nmy mother, and this my father. A vengeance on ’t, there ’tis. Now, sir,\r\nthis staff is my sister, for, look you, she is as white as a lily and\r\nas small as a wand. This hat is Nan, our maid. I am the dog. No, the\r\ndog is himself, and I am the dog. O, the dog is me, and I am myself.\r\nAy, so, so. Now come I to my father: “Father, your blessing.” Now\r\nshould not the shoe speak a word for weeping. Now should I kiss my\r\nfather. Well, he weeps on. Now come I to my mother. O, that she could\r\nspeak now like a wood woman! Well, I kiss her. Why there ’tis; here’s\r\nmy mother’s breath up and down. Now come I to my sister. Mark the moan\r\nshe makes. Now the dog all this while sheds not a tear nor speaks a\r\nword; but see how I lay the dust with my tears.\r\n\r\nEnter Pantino.\r\n\r\nPANTINO.\r\nLance, away, away! Aboard! Thy master is shipped, and thou art to post\r\nafter with oars. What’s the matter? Why weep’st thou, man? Away, ass.\r\nYou’ll lose the tide if you tarry any longer.\r\n\r\nLANCE.\r\nIt is no matter if the tied were lost, for it is the unkindest tied\r\nthat ever any man tied.\r\n\r\nPANTINO.\r\nWhat’s the unkindest tide?\r\n\r\nLANCE.\r\nWhy, he that’s tied here, Crab, my dog.\r\n\r\nPANTINO.\r\nTut, man, I mean thou’lt lose the flood, and, in losing the flood, lose\r\nthy voyage, and, in losing thy voyage, lose thy master, and, in losing\r\nthy master, lose thy service, and, in losing thy service—why dost thou\r\nstop my mouth?\r\n\r\nLANCE.\r\nFor fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue.\r\n\r\nPANTINO.\r\nWhere should I lose my tongue?\r\n\r\nLANCE.\r\nIn thy tale.\r\n\r\nPANTINO.\r\nIn thy tail!\r\n\r\nLANCE.\r\nLose the tide, and the voyage, and the master, and the service, and the\r\ntied? Why, man, if the river were dry, I am able to fill it with my\r\ntears; if the wind were down, I could drive the boat with my sighs.\r\n\r\nPANTINO.\r\nCome, come away, man. I was sent to call thee.\r\n\r\nLANCE.\r\nSir, call me what thou dar’st.\r\n\r\nPANTINO.\r\nWill thou go?\r\n\r\nLANCE.\r\nWell, I will go.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV. Milan.

Do you change colour?\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nGive him leave, madam, he is a kind of chameleon.\r\n\r\nTHURIO.\r\nThat hath more mind to feed on your blood than live in your air.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nYou have said, sir.\r\n\r\nTHURIO.\r\nAy, sir, and done too, for this time.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nI know it well, sir. You always end ere you begin.\r\n\r\nSILVIA.\r\nA fine volley of words, gentlemen, and quickly shot off.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\n’Tis indeed, madam, we thank the giver.\r\n\r\nSILVIA.\r\nWho is that, servant?\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nYourself, sweet lady, for you gave the fire. Sir Thurio borrows his wit\r\nfrom your ladyship’s looks, and spends what he borrows kindly in your\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nTHURIO.\r\nSir, if you spend word for word with me, I shall make your wit\r\nbankrupt.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nI know it well, sir. You have an exchequer of words and, I think, no\r\nother treasure to give your followers, for it appears by their bare\r\nliveries that they live by your bare words.\r\n\r\nSILVIA.\r\nNo more, gentlemen, no more. Here comes my father.\r\n\r\nEnter Duke.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nNow, daughter Silvia, you are hard beset.\r\nSir Valentine, your father is in good health.\r\nWhat say you to a letter from your friends\r\nOf much good news?\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nMy lord, I will be thankful\r\nTo any happy messenger from thence.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nKnow ye Don Antonio, your countryman?\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nAy, my good lord, I know the gentleman\r\nTo be of worth and worthy estimation,\r\nAnd not without desert so well reputed.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nHath he not a son?\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nAy, my good lord, a son that well deserves\r\nThe honour and regard of such a father.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nYou know him well?\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nI knew him as myself, for from our infancy\r\nWe have conversed and spent our hours together.\r\nAnd though myself have been an idle truant,\r\nOmitting the sweet benefit of time\r\nTo clothe mine age with angel-like perfection,\r\nYet hath Sir Proteus, for that’s his name,\r\nMade use and fair advantage of his days:\r\nHis years but young, but his experience old;\r\nHis head unmellowed, but his judgement ripe;\r\nAnd in a word, for far behind his worth\r\nComes all the praises that I now bestow,\r\nHe is complete in feature and in mind,\r\nWith all good grace to grace a gentleman.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nBeshrew me, sir, but if he make this good,\r\nHe is as worthy for an empress’ love\r\nAs meet to be an emperor’s counsellor.\r\nWell, sir, this gentleman is come to me\r\nWith commendation from great potentates,\r\nAnd here he means to spend his time awhile.\r\nI think ’tis no unwelcome news to you.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nShould I have wished a thing, it had been he.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWelcome him then according to his worth.\r\nSilvia, I speak to you, and you, Sir Thurio.\r\nFor Valentine, I need not cite him to it.\r\nI will send him hither to you presently.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nThis is the gentleman I told your ladyship\r\nHad come along with me but that his mistresss\r\nDid hold his eyes locked in her crystal looks.\r\n\r\nSILVIA.\r\nBelike that now she hath enfranchised them\r\nUpon some other pawn for fealty.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nNay, sure, I think she holds them prisoners still.\r\n\r\nSILVIA.\r\nNay, then, he should be blind, and being blind\r\nHow could he see his way to seek out you?\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nWhy, lady, Love hath twenty pair of eyes.\r\n\r\nTHURIO.\r\nThey say that Love hath not an eye at all.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nTo see such lovers, Thurio, as yourself.\r\nUpon a homely object, Love can wink.\r\n\r\nSILVIA.\r\nHave done, have done.

The same\r\n\r\nEnter Lance with his dog Crab.\r\n\r\nLANCE.\r\nWhen a man’s servant shall play the cur with him, look you, it goes\r\nhard: one that I brought up of a puppy; one that I saved from drowning\r\nwhen three or four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it. I have\r\ntaught him even as one would say precisely, “Thus I would teach a dog.”\r\nI was sent to deliver him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my\r\nmaster; and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he steps me to\r\nher trencher and steals her capon’s leg. O, ’tis a foul thing when a\r\ncur cannot keep himself in all companies! I would have, as one should\r\nsay, one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be, as it were, a\r\ndog at all things. If I had not had more wit than he, to take a fault\r\nupon me that he did, I think verily he had been hanged for’t; sure as I\r\nlive, he had suffered for’t. You shall judge. He thrusts me himself\r\ninto the company of three or four gentleman-like dogs under the Duke’s\r\ntable; he had not been there—bless the mark!—a pissing-while but all\r\nthe chamber smelt him. “Out with the dog!” says one; “What cur is\r\nthat?” says another; “Whip him out”, says the third; “Hang him up”,\r\nsays the Duke. I, having been acquainted with the smell before, knew it\r\nwas Crab, and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs. “Friend,”\r\nquoth I, “you mean to whip the dog?” “Ay, marry do I,” quoth he. “You do\r\nhim the more wrong,” quoth I. “’Twas I did the thing you wot of.” He\r\nmakes me no more ado but whips me out of the chamber. How many masters\r\nwould do this for his servant? Nay, I’ll be sworn I have sat in the\r\nstock for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he had been executed. I\r\nhave stood on the pillory for geese he hath killed, otherwise he had\r\nsuffered for’t. [_To Crab_.] Thou think’st not of this now. Nay, I\r\nremember the trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam Silvia.\r\nDid not I bid thee still mark me, and do as I do? When didst thou see\r\nme heave up my leg and make water against a gentlewoman’s farthingale?\r\nDidst thou ever see me do such a trick?\r\n\r\nEnter Proteus and Julia disguised as Sebastian.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nSebastian is thy name? I like thee well,\r\nAnd will employ thee in some service presently.\r\n\r\nJULIA.\r\nIn what you please; I’ll do what I can.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nI hope thou wilt. [_To Lance_.] How now, you whoreson peasant,\r\nWhere have you been these two days loitering?\r\n\r\nLANCE.\r\nMarry, sir, I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nAnd what says she to my little jewel?\r\n\r\nLANCE.\r\nMarry, she says your dog was a cur, and tells you currish thanks is\r\ngood enough for such a present.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nBut she received my dog?\r\n\r\nLANCE.\r\nNo, indeed, did she not. Here have I brought him back again.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nWhat, didst thou offer her this from me?\r\n\r\nLANCE.\r\nAy, sir, the other squirrel was stolen from me by the hangman’s boys in\r\nthe market-place, and then I offered her mine own, who is a dog as big\r\nas ten of yours, and therefore the gift the greater.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nGo, get thee hence, and find my dog again,\r\nOr ne’er return again into my sight.\r\nAway, I say. Stayest thou to vex me here?\r\nA slave that still an end turns me to shame.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Lance with Crab._]\r\n\r\nSebastian, I have entertained thee\r\nPartly that I have need of such a youth\r\nThat can with some discretion do my business—\r\nFor ’tis no trusting to yond foolish lout—\r\nBut chiefly for thy face and thy behaviour,\r\nWhich, if my augury deceive me not,\r\nWitness good bringing up, fortune, and truth.\r\nTherefore, know thou, for this I entertain thee.\r\nGo presently, and take this ring with thee,\r\nDeliver it to Madam Silvia.\r\nShe loved me well delivered it to me.\r\n\r\nJULIA.\r\nIt seems you loved not her, to leave her token.\r\nShe’s dead belike?\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nNot so; I think she lives.\r\n\r\nJULIA.\r\nAlas!\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nWhy dost thou cry “Alas”?\r\n\r\nJULIA.\r\nI cannot choose\r\nBut pity her.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nWherefore shouldst thou pity her?\r\n\r\nJULIA.\r\nBecause methinks that she loved you as well\r\nAs you do love your lady Silvia.\r\nShe dreams on him that has forgot her love;\r\nYou dote on her that cares not for your love.\r\n’Tis pity love should be so contrary;\r\nAnd thinking on it makes me cry “Alas.”\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nWell, give her that ring, and therewithal\r\nThis letter. That’s her chamber. Tell my lady\r\nI claim the promise for her heavenly picture.\r\nYour message done, hie home unto my chamber,\r\nWhere thou shalt find me sad and solitary.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nJULIA.\r\nHow many women would do such a message?\r\nAlas, poor Proteus, thou hast entertained\r\nA fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.\r\nAlas, poor fool, why do I pity him\r\nThat with his very heart despiseth me?\r\nBecause he loves her, he despiseth me;\r\nBecause I love him, I must pity him.\r\nThis ring I gave him when he parted from me,\r\nTo bind him to remember my good will;\r\nAnd now am I, unhappy messenger,\r\nTo plead for that which I would not obtain,\r\nTo carry that which I would have refused,\r\nTo praise his faith, which I would have dispraised.\r\nI am my master’s true confirmed love,\r\nBut cannot be true servant to my master\r\nUnless I prove false traitor to myself.\r\nYet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly\r\nAs, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.\r\n\r\nEnter Silvia attended.\r\n\r\nGentlewoman, good day. I pray you be my mean\r\nTo bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.\r\n\r\nSILVIA.\r\nWhat would you with her, if that I be she?\r\n\r\nJULIA.\r\nIf you be she, I do entreat your patience\r\nTo hear me speak the message I am sent on.\r\n\r\nSILVIA.\r\nFrom whom?\r\n\r\nJULIA.\r\nFrom my master, Sir Proteus, madam.\r\n\r\nSILVIA.\r\nO, he sends you for a picture?\r\n\r\nJULIA.\r\nAy, madam.\r\n\r\nSILVIA.\r\nUrsula, bring my picture there.\r\n\r\n[_She is brought the picture._]\r\n\r\nGo, give your master this.

Good madam, pardon me.\r\n\r\nSILVIA.\r\nThere, hold.\r\nI will not look upon your master’s lines.\r\nI know they are stuffed with protestations\r\nAnd full of new-found oaths, which he will break\r\nAs easily as I do tear his paper.\r\n\r\n[_She tears the second letter._]\r\n\r\nJULIA.\r\nMadam, he sends your ladyship this ring.\r\n\r\nSILVIA.\r\nThe more shame for him that he sends it me;\r\nFor I have heard him say a thousand times\r\nHis Julia gave it him at his departure.\r\nThough his false finger have profaned the ring,\r\nMine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.\r\n\r\nJULIA.\r\nShe thanks you.\r\n\r\nSILVIA.\r\nWhat sayst thou?\r\n\r\nJULIA.\r\nI thank you, madam, that you tender her.\r\nPoor gentlewoman, my master wrongs her much.\r\n\r\nSILVIA.\r\nDost thou know her?\r\n\r\nJULIA.\r\nAlmost as well as I do know myself.\r\nTo think upon her woes, I do protest\r\nThat I have wept a hundred several times.\r\n\r\nSILVIA.\r\nBelike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her?\r\n\r\nJULIA.\r\nI think she doth, and that’s her cause of sorrow.\r\n\r\nSILVIA.\r\nIs she not passing fair?\r\n\r\nJULIA.\r\nShe hath been fairer, madam, than she is.\r\nWhen she did think my master loved her well,\r\nShe, in my judgement, was as fair as you.\r\nBut since she did neglect her looking-glass\r\nAnd threw her sun-expelling mask away,\r\nThe air hath starved the roses in her cheeks\r\nAnd pinched the lily-tincture of her face,\r\nThat now she is become as black as I.\r\n\r\nSILVIA.\r\nHow tall was she?\r\n\r\nJULIA.\r\nAbout my stature; for at Pentecost,\r\nWhen all our pageants of delight were played,\r\nOur youth got me to play the woman’s part,\r\nAnd I was trimmed in Madam Julia’s gown,\r\nWhich served me as fit, by all men’s judgements,\r\nAs if the garment had been made for me;\r\nTherefore I know she is about my height.\r\nAnd at that time I made her weep agood,\r\nFor I did play a lamentable part.\r\nMadam, ’twas Ariadne, passioning\r\nFor Theseus’ perjury and unjust flight,\r\nWhich I so lively acted with my tears\r\nThat my poor mistress, moved therewithal,\r\nWept bitterly; and would I might be dead\r\nIf I in thought felt not her very sorrow.\r\n\r\nSILVIA.\r\nShe is beholding to thee, gentle youth.\r\nAlas, poor lady, desolate and left!\r\nI weep myself to think upon thy words.\r\nHere, youth, there is my purse. I give thee this\r\nFor thy sweet mistress’ sake, because thou lov’st her.\r\nFarewell.\r\n\r\nJULIA.\r\nAnd she shall thank you for’t, if e’er you know her.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Silvia and Attendants._]\r\n\r\nA virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful.\r\nI hope my master’s suit will be but cold,\r\nSince she respects my mistress’ love so much.\r\nAlas, how love can trifle with itself!\r\nHere is her picture; let me see.

O thou senseless form,\r\nThou shalt be worshipped, kissed, loved, and adored;\r\nAnd were there sense in his idolatry,\r\nMy substance should be statue in thy stead.\r\nI’ll use thee kindly for thy mistress’ sake,\r\nThat used me so; or else, by Jove I vow,\r\nI should have scratched out your unseeing eyes\r\nTo make my master out of love with thee.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\nACT V\r\n\r\nSCENE I.

Lady, a happy evening!\r\n\r\nSILVIA.\r\nAmen, amen. Go on, good Eglamour,\r\nOut at the postern by the abbey wall.\r\nI fear I am attended by some spies.\r\n\r\nEGLAMOUR.\r\nFear not.

A room in the Duke’s palace\r\n\r\nEnter Thurio, Proteus and Julia.\r\n\r\nTHURIO.\r\nSir Proteus, what says Silvia to my suit?\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nO, sir, I find her milder than she was,\r\nAnd yet she takes exceptions at your person.\r\n\r\nTHURIO.\r\nWhat? That my leg is too long?\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nNo, that it is too little.\r\n\r\nTHURIO.\r\nI’ll wear a boot to make it somewhat rounder.\r\n\r\nJULIA.\r\n[_Aside_.] But love will not be spurred to what it loathes.\r\n\r\nTHURIO.\r\nWhat says she to my face?\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nShe says it is a fair one.\r\n\r\nTHURIO.\r\nNay, then, the wanton lies; my face is black.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nBut pearls are fair; and the old saying is,\r\n“Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies’ eyes.”\r\n\r\nJULIA.\r\n[_Aside_.] ’Tis true, such pearls as put out ladies’ eyes,\r\nFor I had rather wink than look on them.\r\n\r\nTHURIO.\r\nHow likes she my discourse?\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nIll, when you talk of war.\r\n\r\nTHURIO.\r\nBut well when I discourse of love and peace.\r\n\r\nJULIA.\r\n[_Aside_.] But better, indeed, when you hold your peace.\r\n\r\nTHURIO.\r\nWhat says she to my valour?\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nO, sir, she makes no doubt of that.\r\n\r\nJULIA.\r\n[_Aside_.] She needs not, when she knows it cowardice.\r\n\r\nTHURIO.\r\nWhat says she to my birth?\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nThat you are well derived.\r\n\r\nJULIA.\r\n[_Aside_.] True, from a gentleman to a fool.\r\n\r\nTHURIO.\r\nConsiders she my possessions?\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nO, ay, and pities them.\r\n\r\nTHURIO.\r\nWherefore?\r\n\r\nJULIA.\r\n[_Aside_.] That such an ass should owe them.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nThat they are out by lease.\r\n\r\nJULIA.\r\nHere comes the Duke.\r\n\r\nEnter Duke.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nHow now, Sir Proteus!

Julia?\r\n\r\nJULIA.\r\nBehold her that gave aim to all thy oaths\r\nAnd entertained ’em deeply in her heart.\r\nHow oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!\r\nO Proteus, let this habit make thee blush.\r\nBe thou ashamed that I have took upon me\r\nSuch an immodest raiment, if shame live\r\nIn a disguise of love.\r\nIt is the lesser blot, modesty finds,\r\nWomen to change their shapes than men their minds.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nThan men their minds! ’Tis true. O heaven, were man\r\nBut constant, he were perfect. That one error\r\nFills him with faults, makes him run through all th’ sins;\r\nInconstancy falls off ere it begins.\r\nWhat is in Silvia’s face but I may spy\r\nMore fresh in Julia’s with a constant eye?\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nCome, come, a hand from either.\r\nLet me be blest to make this happy close.\r\n’Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.\r\n\r\nPROTEUS.\r\nBear witness, heaven, I have my wish for ever.\r\n\r\nJULIA.\r\nAnd I mine.\r\n\r\nEnter Outlaws with Duke and Thurio.\r\n\r\nOUTLAWS.\r\nA prize, a prize, a prize!\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nForbear, forbear, I say!

And a good play,\r\nWhose modest scenes blush on his marriage day\r\nAnd shake to lose his honour, is like her\r\nThat after holy tie and first night’s stir\r\nYet still is Modesty, and still retains\r\nMore of the maid, to sight, than husband’s pains.\r\nWe pray our play may be so, for I am sure\r\nIt has a noble breeder and a pure,\r\nA learned, and a poet never went\r\nMore famous yet ’twixt Po and silver Trent.\r\nChaucer, of all admired, the story gives;\r\nThere, constant to eternity, it lives.\r\nIf we let fall the nobleness of this,\r\nAnd the first sound this child hear be a hiss,\r\nHow will it shake the bones of that good man\r\nAnd make him cry from underground, “O, fan\r\nFrom me the witless chaff of such a writer\r\nThat blasts my bays and my famed works makes lighter\r\nThan Robin Hood!” This is the fear we bring;\r\nFor, to say truth, it were an endless thing\r\nAnd too ambitious, to aspire to him,\r\nWeak as we are, and, almost breathless, swim\r\nIn this deep water. Do but you hold out\r\nYour helping hands, and we shall tack about\r\nAnd something do to save us. You shall hear\r\nScenes, though below his art, may yet appear\r\nWorth two hours’ travel.

Deliver you for all.\r\n\r\nFIRST QUEEN.\r\nWe are three queens whose sovereigns fell before\r\nThe wrath of cruel Creon, who endure\r\nThe beaks of ravens, talons of the kites,\r\nAnd pecks of crows, in the foul fields of Thebes.\r\nHe will not suffer us to burn their bones,\r\nTo urn their ashes, nor to take th’ offence\r\nOf mortal loathsomeness from the blest eye\r\nOf holy Phœbus, but infects the winds\r\nWith stench of our slain lords. O, pity, Duke!\r\nThou purger of the earth, draw thy feared sword\r\nThat does good turns to th’ world; give us the bones\r\nOf our dead kings, that we may chapel them;\r\nAnd of thy boundless goodness take some note\r\nThat for our crowned heads we have no roof\r\nSave this, which is the lion’s and the bear’s,\r\nAnd vault to everything.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nPray you, kneel not.\r\nI was transported with your speech and suffered\r\nYour knees to wrong themselves. I have heard the fortunes\r\nOf your dead lords, which gives me such lamenting\r\nAs wakes my vengeance and revenge for ’em.\r\nKing Capaneus was your lord. The day\r\nThat he should marry you, at such a season\r\nAs now it is with me, I met your groom\r\nBy Mars’s altar. You were that time fair!\r\nNot Juno’s mantle fairer than your tresses,\r\nNor in more bounty spread her. Your wheaten wreath\r\nWas then nor threshed nor blasted. Fortune at you\r\nDimpled her cheek with smiles. Hercules, our kinsman,\r\nThen weaker than your eyes, laid by his club;\r\nHe tumbled down upon his Nemean hide\r\nAnd swore his sinews thawed. O grief and time,\r\nFearful consumers, you will all devour!\r\n\r\nFIRST QUEEN.\r\nO, I hope some god,\r\nSome god hath put his mercy in your manhood,\r\nWhereto he’ll infuse power, and press you forth\r\nOur undertaker.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nO, no knees, none, widow!\r\nUnto the helmeted Bellona use them,\r\nAnd pray for me, your soldier.\r\nTroubled I am.\r\n\r\n[_Turns away._]\r\n\r\nSECOND QUEEN.\r\nHonoured Hippolyta,\r\nMost dreaded Amazonian, that hast slain\r\nThe scythe-tusked boar; that with thy arm, as strong\r\nAs it is white, wast near to make the male\r\nTo thy sex captive, but that this thy lord,\r\nBorn to uphold creation in that honour\r\nFirst nature styled it in, shrunk thee into\r\nThe bound thou wast o’erflowing, at once subduing\r\nThy force and thy affection; soldieress\r\nThat equally canst poise sternness with pity,\r\nWhom now I know hast much more power on him\r\nThan ever he had on thee, who ow’st his strength\r\nAnd his love too, who is a servant for\r\nThe tenor of thy speech, dear glass of ladies,\r\nBid him that we, whom flaming war doth scorch,\r\nUnder the shadow of his sword may cool us;\r\nRequire him he advance it o’er our heads;\r\nSpeak ’t in a woman’s key, like such a woman\r\nAs any of us three; weep ere you fail.\r\nLend us a knee;\r\nBut touch the ground for us no longer time\r\nThan a dove’s motion when the head’s plucked off.\r\nTell him if he i’ th’ blood-sized field lay swollen,\r\nShowing the sun his teeth, grinning at the moon,\r\nWhat you would do.\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA.\r\nPoor lady, say no more.\r\nI had as lief trace this good action with you\r\nAs that whereto I am going, and never yet\r\nWent I so willing way.

There through my tears,\r\nLike wrinkled pebbles in a glassy stream,\r\nYou may behold ’em. Lady, lady, alack!\r\nHe that will all the treasure know o’ th’ earth\r\nMust know the center too; he that will fish\r\nFor my least minnow, let him lead his line\r\nTo catch one at my heart. O, pardon me!\r\nExtremity, that sharpens sundry wits,\r\nMakes me a fool.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nPray you say nothing, pray you.\r\nWho cannot feel nor see the rain, being in ’t,\r\nKnows neither wet nor dry. If that you were\r\nThe ground-piece of some painter, I would buy you\r\nT’ instruct me ’gainst a capital grief, indeed\r\nSuch heart-pierced demonstration. But, alas,\r\nBeing a natural sister of our sex,\r\nYour sorrow beats so ardently upon me\r\nThat it shall make a counter-reflect ’gainst\r\nMy brother’s heart and warm it to some pity,\r\nThough it were made of stone. Pray have good comfort.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nForward to th’ temple! Leave not out a jot\r\nO’ th’ sacred ceremony.\r\n\r\nFIRST QUEEN.\r\nO, this celebration\r\nWill longer last and be more costly than\r\nYour suppliants’ war! Remember that your fame\r\nKnolls in the ear o’ th’ world; what you do quickly\r\nIs not done rashly; your first thought is more\r\nThan others’ laboured meditance, your premeditating\r\nMore than their actions. But, O Jove, your actions,\r\nSoon as they move, as ospreys do the fish,\r\nSubdue before they touch. Think, dear Duke, think\r\nWhat beds our slain kings have!\r\n\r\nSECOND QUEEN.\r\nWhat griefs our beds,\r\nThat our dear lords have none!\r\n\r\nTHIRD QUEEN.\r\nNone fit for th’ dead.\r\nThose that with cords, knives, drams, precipitance,\r\nWeary of this world’s light, have to themselves\r\nBeen death’s most horrid agents, human grace\r\nAffords them dust and shadow.\r\n\r\nFIRST QUEEN.\r\nBut our lords\r\nLie blist’ring ’fore the visitating sun,\r\nAnd were good kings when living.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nIt is true, and I will give you comfort\r\nTo give your dead lords graves;\r\nThe which to do must make some work with Creon.\r\n\r\nFIRST QUEEN.\r\nAnd that work presents itself to th’ doing.\r\nNow ’twill take form; the heats are gone tomorrow.\r\nThen, bootless toil must recompense itself\r\nWith its own sweat. Now he’s secure,\r\nNot dreams we stand before your puissance,\r\nRinsing our holy begging in our eyes\r\nTo make petition clear.\r\n\r\nSECOND QUEEN.\r\nNow you may take him, drunk with his victory.\r\n\r\nTHIRD QUEEN.\r\nAnd his army full of bread and sloth.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nArtesius, that best knowest\r\nHow to draw out fit to this enterprise\r\nThe prim’st for this proceeding, and the number\r\nTo carry such a business: forth and levy\r\nOur worthiest instruments, whilst we dispatch\r\nThis grand act of our life, this daring deed\r\nOf fate in wedlock.\r\n\r\nFIRST QUEEN.\r\nDowagers, take hands.\r\nLet us be widows to our woes; delay\r\nCommends us to a famishing hope.\r\n\r\nALL THE QUEENS.\r\nFarewell!\r\n\r\nSECOND QUEEN.\r\nWe come unseasonably; but when could grief\r\nCull forth, as unpanged judgement can, fitt’st time\r\nFor best solicitation?\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nWhy, good ladies,\r\nThis is a service, whereto I am going,\r\nGreater than any war; it more imports me\r\nThan all the actions that I have foregone,\r\nOr futurely can cope.\r\n\r\nFIRST QUEEN.\r\nThe more proclaiming\r\nOur suit shall be neglected when her arms,\r\nAble to lock Jove from a synod, shall\r\nBy warranting moonlight corselet thee. O, when\r\nHer twinning cherries shall their sweetness fall\r\nUpon thy tasteful lips, what wilt thou think\r\nOf rotten kings or blubbered queens? What care\r\nFor what thou feel’st not, what thou feel’st being able\r\nTo make Mars spurn his drum? O, if thou couch\r\nBut one night with her, every hour in ’t will\r\nTake hostage of thee for a hundred, and\r\nThou shalt remember nothing more than what\r\nThat banquet bids thee to.\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA.\r\nThough much unlike\r\nYou should be so transported, as much sorry\r\nI should be such a suitor, yet I think,\r\nDid I not, by th’ abstaining of my joy,\r\nWhich breeds a deeper longing, cure their surfeit\r\nThat craves a present med’cine, I should pluck\r\nAll ladies’ scandal on me. Therefore, sir,\r\n\r\n[_She kneels._]\r\n\r\nAs I shall here make trial of my prayers,\r\nEither presuming them to have some force,\r\nOr sentencing for aye their vigor dumb,\r\nProrogue this business we are going about, and hang\r\nYour shield afore your heart, about that neck\r\nWhich is my fee, and which I freely lend\r\nTo do these poor queens service.\r\n\r\nALL QUEENS.\r\n[_To Emilia_.] O, help now!\r\nOur cause cries for your knee.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\n[_To Theseus, kneeling_.] If you grant not\r\nMy sister her petition in that force,\r\nWith that celerity and nature, which\r\nShe makes it in, from henceforth I’ll not dare\r\nTo ask you anything, nor be so hardy\r\nEver to take a husband.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nPray stand up.\r\nI am entreating of myself to do\r\n\r\n[_They rise._]\r\n\r\nThat which you kneel to have me.—Pirithous,\r\nLead on the bride; get you and pray the gods\r\nFor success and return; omit not anything\r\nIn the pretended celebration.—Queens,\r\nFollow your soldier. [_To Artesius._] As before, hence you,\r\nAnd at the banks of Aulis meet us with\r\nThe forces you can raise, where we shall find\r\nThe moiety of a number for a business\r\nMore bigger looked.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Artesius._]\r\n\r\n[_To Hippolyta._] Since that our theme is haste,\r\nI stamp this kiss upon thy currant lip;\r\nSweet, keep it as my token. Set you forward,\r\nFor I will see you gone.\r\n\r\n[_The wedding procession moves towards the temple._]\r\n\r\nFarewell, my beauteous sister.—Pirithous,\r\nKeep the feast full; bate not an hour on ’t.\r\n\r\nPIRITHOUS.\r\nSir,\r\nI’ll follow you at heels. The feast’s solemnity\r\nShall want till your return.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nCousin, I charge you,\r\nBudge not from Athens. We shall be returning\r\nEre you can end this feast, of which I pray you\r\nMake no abatement. Once more, farewell all.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt all but Theseus and the Queens._]\r\n\r\nFIRST QUEEN.\r\nThus dost thou still make good the tongue o’ th’ world.\r\n\r\nSECOND QUEEN.\r\nAnd earn’st a deity equal with Mars.\r\n\r\nTHIRD QUEEN.\r\nIf not above him, for\r\nThou, being but mortal, mak’st affections bend\r\nTo godlike honours; they themselves, some say,\r\nGroan under such a mast’ry.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nAs we are men,\r\nThus should we do; being sensually subdued,\r\nWe lose our human title. Good cheer, ladies.\r\nNow turn we towards your comforts.\r\n\r\n[_Flourish. Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. Thebes. The Court of the Palace\r\n\r\nEnter Palamon and Arcite.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nDear Palamon, dearer in love than blood\r\nAnd our prime cousin, yet unhardened in\r\nThe crimes of nature, let us leave the city\r\nThebes, and the temptings in ’t, before we further\r\nSully our gloss of youth\r\nAnd here to keep in abstinence we shame\r\nAs in incontinence; for not to swim\r\nI’ th’ aid o’ th’ current, were almost to sink,\r\nAt least to frustrate striving; and to follow\r\nThe common stream, ’twould bring us to an eddy\r\nWhere we should turn or drown; if labour through,\r\nOur gain but life and weakness.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nYour advice\r\nIs cried up with example. What strange ruins,\r\nSince first we went to school, may we perceive\r\nWalking in Thebes! Scars and bare weeds\r\nThe gain o’ th’ martialist, who did propound\r\nTo his bold ends honour and golden ingots,\r\nWhich, though he won, he had not, and now flirted\r\nBy peace for whom he fought! Who then shall offer\r\nTo Mars’s so-scorned altar? I do bleed\r\nWhen such I meet, and wish great Juno would\r\nResume her ancient fit of jealousy\r\nTo get the soldier work, that peace might purge\r\nFor her repletion, and retain anew\r\nHer charitable heart, now hard and harsher\r\nThan strife or war could be.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nAre you not out?\r\nMeet you no ruin but the soldier in\r\nThe cranks and turns of Thebes? You did begin\r\nAs if you met decays of many kinds.\r\nPerceive you none that do arouse your pity\r\nBut th’ unconsidered soldier?\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nYes, I pity\r\nDecays where’er I find them, but such most\r\nThat, sweating in an honourable toil,\r\nAre paid with ice to cool ’em.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\n’Tis not this\r\nI did begin to speak of. This is virtue\r\nOf no respect in Thebes. I spake of Thebes,\r\nHow dangerous, if we will keep our honours,\r\nIt is for our residing, where every evil\r\nHath a good colour; where every seeming good’s\r\nA certain evil; where not to be e’en jump\r\nAs they are here were to be strangers, and,\r\nSuch things to be, mere monsters.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\n’Tis in our power—\r\nUnless we fear that apes can tutor ’s—to\r\nBe masters of our manners. What need I\r\nAffect another’s gait, which is not catching\r\nWhere there is faith? Or to be fond upon\r\nAnother’s way of speech, when by mine own\r\nI may be reasonably conceived, saved too,\r\nSpeaking it truly? Why am I bound\r\nBy any generous bond to follow him\r\nFollows his tailor, haply so long until\r\nThe followed make pursuit? Or let me know\r\nWhy mine own barber is unblessed, with him\r\nMy poor chin too, for ’tis not scissored just\r\nTo such a favourite’s glass? What canon is there\r\nThat does command my rapier from my hip\r\nTo dangle ’t in my hand, or to go tiptoe\r\nBefore the street be foul? Either I am\r\nThe fore-horse in the team, or I am none\r\nThat draw i’ th’ sequent trace. These poor slight sores\r\nNeed not a plantain; that which rips my bosom\r\nAlmost to th’ heart’s—\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nOur uncle Creon.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nHe.\r\nA most unbounded tyrant, whose successes\r\nMakes heaven unfeared and villainy assured\r\nBeyond its power there’s nothing; almost puts\r\nFaith in a fever, and deifies alone\r\nVoluble chance; who only attributes\r\nThe faculties of other instruments\r\nTo his own nerves and act; commands men service,\r\nAnd what they win in ’t, boot and glory; one\r\nThat fears not to do harm; good, dares not. Let\r\nThe blood of mine that’s sib to him be sucked\r\nFrom me with leeches; let them break and fall\r\nOff me with that corruption.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nClear-spirited cousin,\r\nLet’s leave his court, that we may nothing share\r\nOf his loud infamy; for our milk\r\nWill relish of the pasture, and we must\r\nBe vile or disobedient; not his kinsmen\r\nIn blood unless in quality.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nNothing truer.\r\nI think the echoes of his shames have deafed\r\nThe ears of heavenly justice. Widows’ cries\r\nDescend again into their throats and have not\r\nDue audience of the gods.\r\n\r\nEnter Valerius.\r\n\r\nValerius!\r\n\r\nVALERIUS.\r\nThe King calls for you; yet be leaden-footed\r\nTill his great rage be off him. Phœbus, when\r\nHe broke his whipstock and exclaimed against\r\nThe horses of the sun, but whispered to\r\nThe loudness of his fury.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nSmall winds shake him.\r\nBut what’s the matter?\r\n\r\nVALERIUS.\r\nTheseus, who where he threats appalls, hath sent\r\nDeadly defiance to him and pronounces\r\nRuin to Thebes, who is at hand to seal\r\nThe promise of his wrath.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nLet him approach.\r\nBut that we fear the gods in him, he brings not\r\nA jot of terror to us. Yet what man\r\nThirds his own worth—the case is each of ours—\r\nWhen that his action’s dregged with mind assured\r\n’Tis bad he goes about?\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nLeave that unreasoned.\r\nOur services stand now for Thebes, not Creon.\r\nYet to be neutral to him were dishonour,\r\nRebellious to oppose; therefore we must\r\nWith him stand to the mercy of our fate,\r\nWho hath bounded our last minute.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nSo we must.\r\n[_To Valerius._] Is ’t said this war’s afoot? Or, it shall be,\r\nOn fail of some condition?\r\n\r\nVALERIUS.\r\n’Tis in motion;\r\nThe intelligence of state came in the instant\r\nWith the defier.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nLet’s to the King; who, were he\r\nA quarter carrier of that honour which\r\nHis enemy come in, the blood we venture\r\nShould be as for our health, which were not spent,\r\nRather laid out for purchase. But alas,\r\nOur hands advanced before our hearts, what will\r\nThe fall o’ th’ stroke do damage?\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nLet th’ event,\r\nThat never-erring arbitrator, tell us\r\nWhen we know all ourselves; and let us follow\r\nThe becking of our chance.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. Before the gates of Athens\r\n\r\nEnter Pirithous, Hippolyta and Emilia.\r\n\r\nPIRITHOUS.\r\nNo further.\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA.\r\nSir, farewell. Repeat my wishes\r\nTo our great lord, of whose success I dare not\r\nMake any timorous question; yet I wish him\r\nExcess and overflow of power, an ’t might be,\r\nTo dure ill-dealing fortune. Speed to him!\r\nStore never hurts good governors.\r\n\r\nPIRITHOUS.\r\nThough I know\r\nHis ocean needs not my poor drops, yet they\r\nMust yield their tribute there. My precious maid,\r\nThose best affections that the heavens infuse\r\nIn their best-tempered pieces keep enthroned\r\nIn your dear heart!\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nThanks, sir. Remember me\r\nTo our all-royal brother, for whose speed\r\nThe great Bellona I’ll solicit; and\r\nSince in our terrene state petitions are not\r\nWithout gifts understood, I’ll offer to her\r\nWhat I shall be advised she likes. Our hearts\r\nAre in his army, in his tent.\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA.\r\nIn ’s bosom.\r\nWe have been soldiers, and we cannot weep\r\nWhen our friends don their helms, or put to sea,\r\nOr tell of babes broached on the lance, or women\r\nThat have sod their infants in—and after eat them—\r\nThe brine they wept at killing ’em. Then if\r\nYou stay to see of us such spinsters, we\r\nShould hold you here for ever.\r\n\r\nPIRITHOUS.\r\nPeace be to you\r\nAs I pursue this war, which shall be then\r\n Beyond further requiring.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Pirithous._]\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nHow his longing\r\nFollows his friend! Since his depart, his sports,\r\nThough craving seriousness and skill, passed slightly\r\nHis careless execution, where nor gain\r\nMade him regard, or loss consider, but\r\nPlaying one business in his hand, another\r\nDirecting in his head, his mind nurse equal\r\nTo these so differing twins. Have you observed him\r\nSince our great lord departed?\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA.\r\nWith much labour,\r\nAnd I did love him for ’t. They two have cabined\r\nIn many as dangerous as poor a corner,\r\nPeril and want contending; they have skiffed\r\nTorrents whose roaring tyranny and power\r\nI’ th’ least of these was dreadful; and they have\r\nFought out together where Death’s self was lodged;\r\nYet fate hath brought them off. Their knot of love,\r\nTied, weaved, entangled, with so true, so long,\r\nAnd with a finger of so deep a cunning,\r\nMay be outworn, never undone. I think\r\nTheseus cannot be umpire to himself,\r\nCleaving his conscience into twain and doing\r\nEach side like justice, which he loves best.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nDoubtless\r\nThere is a best, and reason has no manners\r\nTo say it is not you. I was acquainted\r\nOnce with a time when I enjoyed a playfellow;\r\nYou were at wars when she the grave enriched,\r\nWho made too proud the bed, took leave o’ th’ moon\r\nWhich then looked pale at parting, when our count\r\nWas each eleven.\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA.\r\n’Twas Flavina.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nYes.\r\nYou talk of Pirithous’ and Theseus’ love.\r\nTheirs has more ground, is more maturely seasoned,\r\nMore buckled with strong judgement, and their needs\r\nThe one of th’ other may be said to water\r\nTheir intertangled roots of love; but I,\r\nAnd she I sigh and spoke of, were things innocent,\r\nLoved for we did, and like the elements\r\nThat know not what nor why, yet do effect\r\nRare issues by their operance, our souls\r\nDid so to one another. What she liked\r\nWas then of me approved, what not, condemned,\r\nNo more arraignment. The flower that I would pluck\r\nAnd put between my breasts, O, then but beginning\r\nTo swell about the blossom—she would long\r\nTill she had such another, and commit it\r\nTo the like innocent cradle, where, phœnix-like,\r\nThey died in perfume. On my head no toy\r\nBut was her pattern; her affections—pretty,\r\nThough haply her careless wear—I followed\r\nFor my most serious decking; had mine ear\r\nStol’n some new air, or at adventure hummed one\r\nFrom musical coinage, why, it was a note\r\nWhereon her spirits would sojourn—rather, dwell on,\r\nAnd sing it in her slumbers. This rehearsal,\r\nWhich fury-innocent wots well, comes in\r\nLike old importment’s bastard—has this end,\r\nThat the true love ’tween maid and maid may be\r\nMore than in sex individual.\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA.\r\nYou’re out of breath;\r\nAnd this high-speeded pace is but to say\r\nThat you shall never, like the maid Flavina,\r\nLove any that’s called man.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nI am sure I shall not.\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA.\r\nNow, alack, weak sister,\r\nI must no more believe thee in this point—\r\nThough in ’t I know thou dost believe thyself—\r\nThan I will trust a sickly appetite,\r\nThat loathes even as it longs. But sure, my sister,\r\nIf I were ripe for your persuasion, you\r\nHave said enough to shake me from the arm\r\nOf the all-noble Theseus; for whose fortunes\r\nI will now in and kneel, with great assurance\r\nThat we, more than his Pirithous, possess\r\nThe high throne in his heart.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nI am not\r\nAgainst your faith, yet I continue mine.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV. A field before Thebes.\r\n\r\nCornets. A battle struck within; then a retreat. Flourish. Then enter,\r\nTheseus, as victor, with a Herald, other Lords, and Soldiers. The three\r\nQueens meet him and fall on their faces before him.\r\n\r\nFIRST QUEEN.\r\nTo thee no star be dark!\r\n\r\nSECOND QUEEN.\r\nBoth heaven and earth\r\nFriend thee for ever!\r\n\r\nTHIRD QUEEN.\r\nAll the good that may\r\nBe wished upon thy head, I cry “Amen” to ’t!\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nTh’ impartial gods, who from the mounted heavens\r\nView us their mortal herd, behold who err\r\nAnd, in their time, chastise. Go and find out\r\nThe bones of your dead lords and honour them\r\nWith treble ceremony, rather than a gap\r\nShould be in their dear rites, we would supply ’t,\r\nBut those we will depute which shall invest\r\nYou in your dignities and even each thing\r\nOur haste does leave imperfect. So, adieu,\r\nAnd heaven’s good eyes look on you.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Queens._]\r\n\r\nEnter a Herald and Soldiers bearing Palamon and Arcite on hearses.\r\n\r\nWhat are those?\r\n\r\nHERALD.\r\nMen of great quality, as may be judged\r\nBy their appointment. Some of Thebes have told ’s\r\nThey are sisters’ children, nephews to the King.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nBy th’ helm of Mars, I saw them in the war,\r\nLike to a pair of lions, smeared with prey,\r\nMake lanes in troops aghast. I fixed my note\r\nConstantly on them, for they were a mark\r\nWorth a god’s view. What prisoner was ’t that told me\r\nWhen I enquired their names?\r\n\r\nHERALD.\r\nWi’ leave, they’re called Arcite and Palamon.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\n’Tis right; those, those. They are not dead?\r\n\r\nHERALD.\r\nNor in a state of life. Had they been taken\r\nWhen their last hurts were given, ’twas possible\r\nThey might have been recovered; yet they breathe\r\nAnd have the name of men.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nThen like men use ’em.\r\nThe very lees of such, millions of rates,\r\nExceed the wine of others. All our surgeons\r\nConvent in their behoof; our richest balms,\r\nRather than niggard, waste. Their lives concern us\r\nMuch more than Thebes is worth. Rather than have ’em\r\nFreed of this plight, and in their morning state,\r\nSound and at liberty, I would ’em dead;\r\nBut forty-thousandfold we had rather have ’em\r\nPrisoners to us than death. Bear ’em speedily\r\nFrom our kind air, to them unkind, and minister\r\nWhat man to man may do, for our sake, more,\r\nSince I have known frights, fury, friends’ behests,\r\nLove’s provocations, zeal, a mistress’ task,\r\nDesire of liberty, a fever, madness,\r\nHath set a mark which nature could not reach to\r\nWithout some imposition, sickness in will\r\nO’er-wrestling strength in reason. For our love\r\nAnd great Apollo’s mercy, all our best\r\nTheir best skill tender. Lead into the city,\r\nWhere, having bound things scattered, we will post\r\nTo Athens ’fore our army.\r\n\r\n[_Flourish. Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE V. Another part of the same, more remote from Thebes\r\n\r\nMusic. Enter the Queens with the hearses of their knights, in a funeral\r\nsolemnity, &c.\r\n\r\nSONG.\r\n\n_Urns and odours bring away;\r\nVapours, sighs, darken the day;\r\nOur dole more deadly looks than dying;\r\nBalms and gums and heavy cheers,\r\nSacred vials filled with tears,\r\nAnd clamours through the wild air flying._\r\n\r\n_Come, all sad and solemn shows\r\nThat are quick-eyed Pleasure’s foes;\r\nWe convent naught else but woes.\r\nWe convent naught else but woes._\r\n\r\nTHIRD QUEEN.\r\nThis funeral path brings to your household’s grave.\r\nJoy seize on you again; peace sleep with him.\r\n\r\nSECOND QUEEN.\r\nAnd this to yours.\r\n\r\nFIRST QUEEN.\r\nYours this way. Heavens lend\r\nA thousand differing ways to one sure end.\r\n\r\nTHIRD QUEEN.\r\nThis world’s a city full of straying streets,\r\nAnd death’s the market-place where each one meets.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt severally._]\r\n\nACT II\r\n\r\nSCENE I. Athens. A garden, with a castle in the background\r\n\nEnter Jailer and Wooer.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nI may depart with little while I live; something I may cast to you, not\r\nmuch. Alas, the prison I keep, though it be for great ones, yet they\r\nseldom come; before one salmon, you shall take a number of minnows. I\r\nam given out to be better lined than it can appear to me report is a\r\ntrue speaker. I would I were really that I am delivered to be. Marry,\r\nwhat I have, be it what it will, I will assure upon my daughter at the\r\nday of my death.\r\n\r\nWOOER.\r\nSir, I demand no more than your own offer, and I will estate your\r\ndaughter in what I have promised.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nWell, we will talk more of this when the solemnity is past. But have\r\nyou a full promise of her? When that shall be seen, I tender my\r\nconsent.\r\n\r\nEnter the Jailer’s Daughter, carrying rushes.\r\n\r\nWOOER.\r\nI have sir. Here she comes.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nYour friend and I have chanced to name you here, upon the old business.\r\nBut no more of that now; so soon as the court hurry is over, we will\r\nhave an end of it. I’ th’ meantime, look tenderly to the two prisoners.\r\nI can tell you they are princes.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nThese strewings are for their chamber. ’Tis pity they are in prison,\r\nand ’twere pity they should be out. I do think they have patience to\r\nmake any adversity ashamed. The prison itself is proud of ’em, and they\r\nhave all the world in their chamber.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nThey are famed to be a pair of absolute men.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nBy my troth, I think fame but stammers ’em; they stand a grise above\r\nthe reach of report.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nI heard them reported in the battle to be the only doers.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nNay, most likely, for they are noble sufferers. I marvel how they would\r\nhave looked had they been victors, that with such a constant nobility\r\nenforce a freedom out of bondage, making misery their mirth and\r\naffliction a toy to jest at.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nDo they so?\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nIt seems to me they have no more sense of their captivity than I of\r\nruling Athens. They eat well, look merrily, discourse of many things,\r\nbut nothing of their own restraint and disasters. Yet sometime a\r\ndivided sigh, martyred as ’twere i’ th’ deliverance, will break from\r\none of them—when the other presently gives it so sweet a rebuke that I\r\ncould wish myself a sigh to be so chid, or at least a sigher to be\r\ncomforted.\r\n\r\nWOOER.\r\nI never saw ’em.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nThe Duke himself came privately in the night, and so did they.\r\n\r\nEnter Palamon and Arcite, above.\r\n\r\nWhat the reason of it is, I know not. Look, yonder they are; that’s\r\nArcite looks out.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nNo, sir, no, that’s Palamon. Arcite is the lower of the twain; you may\r\nperceive a part of him.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nGo to, leave your pointing; they would not make us their object. Out of\r\ntheir sight.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nIt is a holiday to look on them. Lord, the difference of men!\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. The prison\r\n\r\nEnter Palamon and Arcite in prison.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nHow do you, noble cousin?\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nHow do you, sir?\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nWhy, strong enough to laugh at misery\r\nAnd bear the chance of war; yet we are prisoners\r\nI fear for ever, cousin.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nI believe it,\r\nAnd to that destiny have patiently\r\nLaid up my hour to come.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nO, cousin Arcite,\r\nWhere is Thebes now? Where is our noble country?\r\nWhere are our friends and kindreds? Never more\r\nMust we behold those comforts, never see\r\nThe hardy youths strive for the games of honour,\r\nHung with the painted favours of their ladies,\r\nLike tall ships under sail; then start amongst ’em,\r\nAnd as an east wind leave ’em all behind us,\r\nLike lazy clouds, whilst Palamon and Arcite,\r\nEven in the wagging of a wanton leg,\r\nOutstripped the people’s praises, won the garlands,\r\nEre they have time to wish ’em ours. O, never\r\nShall we two exercise, like twins of honour,\r\nOur arms again, and feel our fiery horses\r\nLike proud seas under us! Our good swords now—\r\nBetter the red-eyed god of war ne’er wore—\r\nRavished our sides, like age must run to rust\r\nAnd deck the temples of those gods that hate us;\r\nThese hands shall never draw ’em out like lightning\r\nTo blast whole armies more.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nNo, Palamon,\r\nThose hopes are prisoners with us. Here we are,\r\nAnd here the graces of our youths must wither\r\nLike a too-timely spring; here age must find us\r\nAnd, which is heaviest, Palamon, unmarried.\r\nThe sweet embraces of a loving wife,\r\nLoaden with kisses, armed with thousand Cupids,\r\nShall never clasp our necks; no issue know us,\r\nNo figures of ourselves shall we e’er see,\r\nTo glad our age, and like young eagles teach ’em\r\nBoldly to gaze against bright arms and say\r\n“Remember what your fathers were, and conquer!”\r\nThe fair-eyed maids shall weep our banishments\r\nAnd in their songs curse ever-blinded Fortune\r\nTill she for shame see what a wrong she has done\r\nTo youth and nature. This is all our world.\r\nWe shall know nothing here but one another,\r\nHear nothing but the clock that tells our woes.\r\nThe vine shall grow, but we shall never see it;\r\nSummer shall come, and with her all delights,\r\nBut dead-cold winter must inhabit here still.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\n’Tis too true, Arcite. To our Theban hounds\r\nThat shook the aged forest with their echoes\r\nNo more now must we hallow, no more shake\r\nOur pointed javelins whilst the angry swine\r\nFlies like a Parthian quiver from our rages,\r\nStruck with our well-steeled darts. All valiant uses,\r\nThe food and nourishment of noble minds,\r\nIn us two here shall perish; we shall die,\r\nWhich is the curse of honour, lastly,\r\nChildren of grief and ignorance.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nYet, cousin,\r\nEven from the bottom of these miseries,\r\nFrom all that fortune can inflict upon us,\r\nI see two comforts rising, two mere blessings,\r\nIf the gods please: to hold here a brave patience,\r\nAnd the enjoying of our griefs together.\r\nWhilst Palamon is with me, let me perish\r\nIf I think this our prison!\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nCertainly\r\n’Tis a main goodness, cousin, that our fortunes\r\nWere twined together; ’tis most true, two souls\r\nPut in two noble bodies, let ’em suffer\r\nThe gall of hazard, so they grow together,\r\nWill never sink; they must not, say they could.\r\nA willing man dies sleeping and all’s done.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nShall we make worthy uses of this place\r\nThat all men hate so much?\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nHow, gentle cousin?\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nLet’s think this prison holy sanctuary,\r\nTo keep us from corruption of worse men.\r\nWe are young and yet desire the ways of honour;\r\nThat liberty and common conversation,\r\nThe poison of pure spirits, might like women,\r\nWoo us to wander from. What worthy blessing\r\nCan be but our imaginations\r\nMay make it ours? And here being thus together,\r\nWe are an endless mine to one another;\r\nWe are one another’s wife, ever begetting\r\nNew births of love; we are father, friends, acquaintance;\r\nWe are, in one another, families;\r\nI am your heir, and you are mine. This place\r\nIs our inheritance; no hard oppressor\r\nDare take this from us; here with a little patience\r\nWe shall live long and loving. No surfeits seek us;\r\nThe hand of war hurts none here, nor the seas\r\nSwallow their youth. Were we at liberty,\r\nA wife might part us lawfully, or business;\r\nQuarrels consume us; envy of ill men\r\nCrave our acquaintance. I might sicken, cousin,\r\nWhere you should never know it, and so perish\r\nWithout your noble hand to close mine eyes,\r\nOr prayers to the gods. A thousand chances,\r\nWere we from hence, would sever us.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nYou have made me—\r\nI thank you, cousin Arcite—almost wanton\r\nWith my captivity. What a misery\r\nIt is to live abroad and everywhere!\r\n’Tis like a beast, methinks. I find the court here,\r\nI am sure, a more content; and all those pleasures\r\nThat woo the wills of men to vanity\r\nI see through now, and am sufficient\r\nTo tell the world ’tis but a gaudy shadow\r\nThat old Time as he passes by takes with him.\r\nWhat had we been, old in the court of Creon,\r\nWhere sin is justice, lust and ignorance\r\nThe virtues of the great ones? Cousin Arcite,\r\nHad not the loving gods found this place for us,\r\nWe had died as they do, ill old men, unwept,\r\nAnd had their epitaphs, the people’s curses.\r\nShall I say more?\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nI would hear you still.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nYe shall.\r\nIs there record of any two that loved\r\nBetter than we do, Arcite?\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nSure, there cannot.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nI do not think it possible our friendship\r\nShould ever leave us.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nTill our deaths it cannot;\r\n\r\nEnter Emilia and her Woman, below.\r\n\r\nAnd after death our spirits shall be led\r\nTo those that love eternally. Speak on, sir.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nThis garden has a world of pleasures in’t.\r\nWhat flower is this?\r\n\r\nWOMAN.\r\n’Tis called narcissus, madam.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nThat was a fair boy, certain, but a fool,\r\nTo love himself. Were there not maids enough?\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nPray, forward.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nOr were they all hard-hearted?\r\n\r\nWOMAN.\r\nThey could not be to one so fair.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nThou wouldst not.\r\n\r\nWOMAN.\r\nI think I should not, madam.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nThat’s a good wench.\r\nBut take heed to your kindness, though.\r\n\r\nWOMAN.\r\nWhy, madam?\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nMen are mad things.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nWill ye go forward, cousin?\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nCanst not thou work such flowers in silk, wench?\r\n\r\nWOMAN.\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nI’ll have a gown full of ’em, and of these.\r\nThis is a pretty colour; will ’t not do\r\nRarely upon a skirt, wench?\r\n\r\nWOMAN.\r\nDainty, madam.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nCousin, cousin! How do you, sir? Why, Palamon!\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nNever till now I was in prison, Arcite.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nWhy, what’s the matter, man?\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nBehold, and wonder!\r\nBy heaven, she is a goddess.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nHa!\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nDo reverence. She is a goddess, Arcite.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nOf all flowers,\r\nMethinks a rose is best.\r\n\r\nWOMAN.\r\nWhy, gentle madam?\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nIt is the very emblem of a maid.\r\nFor when the west wind courts her gently,\r\nHow modestly she blows and paints the sun\r\nWith her chaste blushes! When the north comes near her,\r\nRude and impatient, then, like chastity,\r\nShe locks her beauties in her bud again,\r\nAnd leaves him to base briers.\r\n\r\nWOMAN.\r\nYet, good madam,\r\nSometimes her modesty will blow so far\r\nShe falls for ’t. A maid,\r\nIf she have any honour, would be loath\r\nTo take example by her.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nThou art wanton.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nShe is wondrous fair.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nShe is all the beauty extant.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nThe sun grows high; let’s walk in. Keep these flowers.\r\nWe’ll see how near art can come near their colours.\r\nI am wondrous merry-hearted. I could laugh now.\r\n\r\nWOMAN.\r\nI could lie down, I am sure.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nAnd take one with you?\r\n\r\nWOMAN.\r\nThat’s as we bargain, madam.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nWell, agree then.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Emilia and Woman._]\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nWhat think you of this beauty?\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\n’Tis a rare one.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nIs’t but a rare one?\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nYes, a matchless beauty.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nMight not a man well lose himself, and love her?\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nI cannot tell what you have done; I have,\r\nBeshrew mine eyes for’t! Now I feel my shackles.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nYou love her, then?\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nWho would not?\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nAnd desire her?\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nBefore my liberty.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nI saw her first.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nThat’s nothing.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nBut it shall be.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nI saw her too.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nYes, but you must not love her.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nI will not, as you do, to worship her\r\nAs she is heavenly and a blessed goddess.\r\nI love her as a woman, to enjoy her.\r\nSo both may love.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nYou shall not love at all.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nNot love at all! Who shall deny me?\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nI, that first saw her; I that took possession\r\nFirst with mine eye of all those beauties in her\r\nRevealed to mankind. If thou lovest her,\r\nOr entertain’st a hope to blast my wishes,\r\nThou art a traitor, Arcite, and a fellow\r\nFalse as thy title to her. Friendship, blood,\r\nAnd all the ties between us, I disclaim\r\nIf thou once think upon her.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nYes, I love her;\r\nAnd, if the lives of all my name lay on it,\r\nI must do so; I love her with my soul.\r\nIf that will lose ye, farewell, Palamon.\r\nI say again, I love, and in loving her maintain\r\nI am as worthy and as free a lover\r\nAnd have as just a title to her beauty,\r\nAs any Palamon, or any living\r\nThat is a man’s son.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nHave I called thee friend?\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nYes, and have found me so. Why are you moved thus?\r\nLet me deal coldly with you: am not I\r\nPart of your blood, part of your soul? You have told me\r\nThat I was Palamon and you were Arcite.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nAm not I liable to those affections,\r\nThose joys, griefs, angers, fears, my friend shall suffer?\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nYe may be.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nWhy then would you deal so cunningly,\r\nSo strangely, so unlike a noble kinsman,\r\nTo love alone? Speak truly; do you think me\r\nUnworthy of her sight?\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nNo; but unjust,\r\nIf thou pursue that sight.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nBecause another\r\nFirst sees the enemy, shall I stand still\r\nAnd let mine honour down, and never charge?\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nYes, if he be but one.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nBut say that one\r\nHad rather combat me?\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nLet that one say so,\r\nAnd use thy freedom. Else, if thou pursuest her,\r\nBe as that cursed man that hates his country,\r\nA branded villain.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nYou are mad.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nI must be,\r\nTill thou art worthy, Arcite; it concerns me;\r\nAnd in this madness, if I hazard thee\r\nAnd take thy life, I deal but truely.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nFie, sir!\r\nYou play the child extremely. I will love her;\r\nI must, I ought to do so, and I dare,\r\nAnd all this justly.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nO, that now, that now,\r\nThy false self and thy friend had but this fortune,\r\nTo be one hour at liberty, and grasp\r\nOur good swords in our hands! I would quickly teach thee\r\nWhat ’twere to filch affection from another!\r\nThou art baser in it than a cutpurse.\r\nPut but thy head out of this window more\r\nAnd, as I have a soul, I’ll nail thy life to ’t.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nThou dar’st not, fool, thou canst not, thou art feeble.\r\nPut my head out? I’ll throw my body out\r\nAnd leap the garden, when I see her next\r\nAnd pitch between her arms, to anger thee.\r\n\r\nEnter Jailer.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nNo more; the keeper’s coming. I shall live\r\nTo knock thy brains out with my shackles.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nDo!\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nBy your leave, gentlemen.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nNow, honest keeper?\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nLord Arcite, you must presently to th’ Duke;\r\nThe cause I know not yet.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nI am ready, keeper.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nPrince Palamon, I must awhile bereave you\r\nOf your fair cousin’s company.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Arcite and Jailer._]\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nAnd me too,\r\nEven when you please, of life.—Why is he sent for?\r\nIt may be he shall marry her; he’s goodly,\r\nAnd like enough the Duke hath taken notice\r\nBoth of his blood and body. But his falsehood!\r\nWhy should a friend be treacherous? If that\r\nGet him a wife so noble and so fair,\r\nLet honest men ne’er love again. Once more\r\nI would but see this fair one. Blessed garden\r\nAnd fruit and flowers more blessed that still blossom\r\nAs her bright eyes shine on ye! Would I were,\r\nFor all the fortune of my life hereafter,\r\nYon little tree, yon blooming apricock!\r\nHow I would spread and fling my wanton arms\r\nIn at her window! I would bring her fruit\r\nFit for the gods to feed on; youth and pleasure\r\nStill as she tasted should be doubled on her;\r\nAnd, if she be not heavenly, I would make her\r\nSo near the gods in nature, they should fear her.\r\n\r\nEnter Jailer.\r\n\r\nAnd then I am sure she would love me. How now, keeper?\r\nWhere’s Arcite?\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nBanished. Prince Pirithous\r\nObtained his liberty, but never more\r\nUpon his oath and life must he set foot\r\nUpon this kingdom.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nHe’s a blessed man.\r\nHe shall see Thebes again, and call to arms\r\nThe bold young men that, when he bids ’em charge,\r\nFall on like fire. Arcite shall have a fortune,\r\nIf he dare make himself a worthy lover,\r\nYet in the field to strike a battle for her;\r\nAnd, if he lose her then, he’s a cold coward.\r\nHow bravely may he bear himself to win her\r\nIf he be noble Arcite, thousand ways!\r\nWere I at liberty, I would do things\r\nOf such a virtuous greatness that this lady,\r\nThis blushing virgin, should take manhood to her\r\nAnd seek to ravish me.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nMy lord for you\r\nI have this charge to—\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nTo discharge my life?\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nNo, but from this place to remove your lordship;\r\nThe windows are too open.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nDevils take ’em,\r\nThat are so envious to me! Prithee, kill me.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nAnd hang for’t afterward!\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nBy this good light,\r\nHad I a sword I would kill thee.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nWhy, my Lord?\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nThou bringst such pelting, scurvy news continually,\r\nThou art not worthy life. I will not go.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nIndeed, you must, my lord.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nMay I see the garden?\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nThen I am resolved, I will not go.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nI must constrain you then; and, for you are dangerous,\r\nI’ll clap more irons on you.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nDo, good keeper.\r\nI’ll shake ’em so, ye shall not sleep;\r\nI’ll make you a new morris. Must I go?\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nThere is no remedy.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nFarewell, kind window.\r\nMay rude wind never hurt thee!—O, my lady,\r\nIf ever thou hast felt what sorrow was,\r\nDream how I suffer.—Come, now bury me.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Palamon and Jailer._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. The country near Athens\r\n\r\nEnter Arcite.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nBanished the kingdom? ’Tis a benefit,\r\nA mercy I must thank ’em for; but banished\r\nThe free enjoying of that face I die for,\r\nO, ’twas a studied punishment, a death\r\nBeyond imagination, such a vengeance\r\nThat, were I old and wicked, all my sins\r\nCould never pluck upon me. Palamon,\r\nThou hast the start now; thou shalt stay and see\r\nHer bright eyes break each morning ’gainst thy window\r\nAnd let in life into thee; thou shalt feed\r\nUpon the sweetness of a noble beauty\r\nThat nature ne’er exceeded nor ne’er shall.\r\nGood gods, what happiness has Palamon!\r\nTwenty to one, he’ll come to speak to her;\r\nAnd if she be as gentle as she’s fair,\r\nI know she’s his; he has a tongue will tame\r\nTempests and make the wild rocks wanton.\r\nCome what can come,\r\nThe worst is death; I will not leave the kingdom.\r\nI know mine own is but a heap of ruins,\r\nAnd no redress there. If I go, he has her.\r\nI am resolved another shape shall make me\r\nOr end my fortunes. Either way I am happy.\r\nI’ll see her and be near her, or no more.\r\n\r\nEnter four Countrymen, and one with a garland before them.\r\n\r\nFIRST COUNTRYMAN.\r\nMy masters, I’ll be there, that’s certain.\r\n\r\nSECOND COUNTRYMAN.\r\nAnd I’ll be there.\r\n\r\nTHIRD COUNTRYMAN.\r\nAnd I.\r\n\r\nFOURTH COUNTRYMAN.\r\nWhy, then, have with you, boys. ’Tis but a chiding.\r\nLet the plough play today; I’ll tickle ’t out\r\nOf the jades’ tails tomorrow.\r\n\r\nFIRST COUNTRYMAN.\r\nI am sure\r\nTo have my wife as jealous as a turkey,\r\nBut that’s all one. I’ll go through; let her mumble.\r\n\r\nSECOND COUNTRYMAN.\r\nClap her aboard tomorrow night, and stow her,\r\nAnd all’s made up again.\r\n\r\nTHIRD COUNTRYMAN.\r\nAy, do but put\r\nA fescue in her fist and you shall see her\r\nTake a new lesson out and be a good wench.\r\nDo we all hold against the Maying?\r\n\r\nFOURTH COUNTRYMAN.\r\nHold?\r\nWhat should ail us?\r\n\r\nTHIRD COUNTRYMAN.\r\nArcas will be there.\r\n\r\nSECOND COUNTRYMAN.\r\nAnd Sennois.\r\nAnd Rycas; and three better lads ne’er danced\r\nUnder green tree. And ye know what wenches, ha?\r\nBut will the dainty domine, the schoolmaster,\r\nKeep touch, do you think? For he does all, ye know.\r\n\r\nTHIRD COUNTRYMAN.\r\nHe’ll eat a hornbook ere he fail. Go to;\r\nThe matter’s too far driven between him\r\nAnd the tanner’s daughter to let slip now;\r\nAnd she must see the Duke, and she must dance too.\r\n\r\nFOURTH COUNTRYMAN.\r\nShall we be lusty?\r\n\r\nSECOND COUNTRYMAN.\r\nAll the boys in Athens\r\nBlow wind i’ th’ breech on ’s. And here I’ll be,\r\nAnd there I’ll be, for our town, and here again,\r\nAnd there again. Ha, boys, hey for the weavers!\r\n\r\nFIRST COUNTRYMAN.\r\nThis must be done i’ th’ woods.\r\n\r\nFOURTH COUNTRYMAN.\r\nO, pardon me.\r\n\r\nSECOND COUNTRYMAN.\r\nBy any means; our thing of learning says so—\r\nWhere he himself will edify the Duke\r\nMost parlously in our behalfs. He’s excellent i’ th’ woods;\r\nBring him to th’ plains, his learning makes no cry.\r\n\r\nTHIRD COUNTRYMAN.\r\nWe’ll see the sports, then every man to ’s tackle;\r\nAnd, sweet companions, let’s rehearse, by any means,\r\nBefore the ladies see us, and do sweetly,\r\nAnd God knows what may come on ’t.\r\n\r\nFOURTH COUNTRYMAN.\r\nContent; the sports once ended, we’ll perform.\r\nAway, boys, and hold.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nBy your leaves, honest friends: pray you, whither go you?\r\n\r\nFOURTH COUNTRYMAN.\r\nWhither? Why, what a question’s that?\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nYes, ’tis a question\r\nTo me that know not.\r\n\r\nTHIRD COUNTRYMAN.\r\nTo the games, my friend.\r\n\r\nSECOND COUNTRYMAN.\r\nWhere were you bred, you know it not?\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nNot far, sir;\r\nAre there such games today?\r\n\r\nFIRST COUNTRYMAN.\r\nYes, marry, are there,\r\nAnd such as you never saw; the Duke himself\r\nWill be in person there.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nWhat pastimes are they?\r\n\r\nSECOND COUNTRYMAN.\r\nWrestling, and running.—’Tis a pretty fellow.\r\n\r\nTHIRD COUNTRYMAN.\r\nThou wilt not go along?\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nNot yet, sir.\r\n\r\nFOURTH COUNTRYMAN.\r\nWell, sir,\r\nTake your own time. Come, boys.\r\n\r\nFIRST COUNTRYMAN.\r\nMy mind misgives me,\r\nThis fellow has a vengeance trick o’ th’ hip;\r\nMark how his body’s made for ’t.\r\n\r\nSECOND COUNTRYMAN.\r\nI’ll be hanged, though,\r\nIf he dare venture. Hang him, plum porridge!\r\nHe wrestle? He roast eggs! Come, let’s be gone, lads.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Countrymen._]\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nThis is an offered opportunity\r\nI durst not wish for. Well I could have wrestled—\r\nThe best men called it excellent—and run\r\nSwifter than wind upon a field of corn,\r\nCurling the wealthy ears, never flew. I’ll venture,\r\nAnd in some poor disguise be there. Who knows\r\nWhether my brows may not be girt with garlands,\r\nAnd happiness prefer me to a place\r\nWhere I may ever dwell in sight of her?\r\n\r\n[_Exit Arcite._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV. Athens. A room in the prison\r\n\r\nEnter Jailer’s Daughter alone.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nWhy should I love this gentleman? ’Tis odds\r\nHe never will affect me. I am base,\r\nMy father the mean keeper of his prison,\r\nAnd he a prince. To marry him is hopeless;\r\nTo be his whore is witless. Out upon ’t!\r\nWhat pushes are we wenches driven to\r\nWhen fifteen once has found us! First, I saw him;\r\nI, seeing, thought he was a goodly man;\r\nHe has as much to please a woman in him,\r\nIf he please to bestow it so, as ever\r\nThese eyes yet looked on. Next, I pitied him,\r\nAnd so would any young wench, o’ my conscience,\r\nThat ever dreamed, or vowed her maidenhead\r\nTo a young handsome man. Then I loved him,\r\nExtremely loved him, infinitely loved him!\r\nAnd yet he had a cousin, fair as he too,\r\nBut in my heart was Palamon, and there,\r\nLord, what a coil he keeps! To hear him\r\nSing in an evening, what a heaven it is!\r\nAnd yet his songs are sad ones. Fairer spoken\r\nWas never gentleman. When I come in\r\nTo bring him water in a morning, first\r\nHe bows his noble body, then salutes me thus:\r\n“Fair, gentle maid, good morrow. May thy goodness\r\nGet thee a happy husband.” Once he kissed me;\r\nI loved my lips the better ten days after.\r\nWould he would do so ev’ry day! He grieves much—\r\nAnd me as much to see his misery.\r\nWhat should I do to make him know I love him?\r\nFor I would fain enjoy him. Say I ventured\r\nTo set him free? What says the law then?\r\nThus much for law or kindred! I will do it;\r\nAnd this night, or tomorrow, he shall love me.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE V. An open place in Athens\r\n\r\nA short flourish of cornets and shouts within. Enter Theseus,\r\nHippolyta, Pirithous, Emilia; Arcite in disguise as a countryman, with\r\na garland, Attendants, and others.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nYou have done worthily. I have not seen,\r\nSince Hercules, a man of tougher sinews.\r\nWhate’er you are, you run the best and wrestle,\r\nThat these times can allow.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nI am proud to please you.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nWhat country bred you?\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nThis; but far off, Prince.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nAre you a gentleman?\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nMy father said so;\r\nAnd to those gentle uses gave me life.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nAre you his heir?\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nHis youngest, sir.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nYour father\r\nSure is a happy sire then. What profess you?\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nA little of all noble qualities.\r\nI could have kept a hawk and well have hallowed\r\nTo a deep cry of dogs. I dare not praise\r\nMy feat in horsemanship, yet they that knew me\r\nWould say it was my best piece; last, and greatest,\r\nI would be thought a soldier.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nYou are perfect.\r\n\r\nPIRITHOUS.\r\nUpon my soul, a proper man.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nHe is so.\r\n\r\nPIRITHOUS.\r\nHow do you like him, lady?\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA.\r\nI admire him.\r\nI have not seen so young a man so noble,\r\nIf he say true, of his sort.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nBelieve,\r\nHis mother was a wondrous handsome woman;\r\nHis face, methinks, goes that way.\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA.\r\nBut his body\r\nAnd fiery mind illustrate a brave father.\r\n\r\nPIRITHOUS.\r\nMark how his virtue, like a hidden sun,\r\nBreaks through his baser garments.\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA.\r\nHe’s well got, sure.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nWhat made you seek this place, sir?\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nNoble Theseus,\r\nTo purchase name and do my ablest service\r\nTo such a well-found wonder as thy worth;\r\nFor only in thy court, of all the world,\r\nDwells fair-eyed Honour.\r\n\r\nPIRITHOUS.\r\nAll his words are worthy.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nSir, we are much indebted to your travel,\r\nNor shall you lose your wish.—Pirithous,\r\nDispose of this fair gentleman.\r\n\r\nPIRITHOUS.\r\nThanks, Theseus.\r\nWhate’er you are, you’re mine, and I shall give you\r\nTo a most noble service: to this lady,\r\nThis bright young virgin; pray, observe her goodness.\r\nYou have honoured her fair birthday with your virtues,\r\nAnd, as your due, you’re hers; kiss her fair hand, sir.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nSir, you’re a noble giver.—Dearest beauty,\r\nThus let me seal my vowed faith.\r\n\r\n[_He kisses her hand._]\r\n\r\nWhen your servant,\r\nYour most unworthy creature, but offends you,\r\nCommand him die, he shall.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nThat were too cruel.\r\nIf you deserve well, sir, I shall soon see ’t.\r\nYou’re mine, and somewhat better than your rank\r\nI’ll use you.\r\n\r\nPIRITHOUS.\r\nI’ll see you furnished, and because you say\r\nYou are a horseman, I must needs entreat you\r\nThis afternoon to ride, but ’tis a rough one.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nI like him better, Prince; I shall not then\r\nFreeze in my saddle.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nSweet, you must be ready,—\r\nAnd you, Emilia,—and you, friend,—and all,\r\nTomorrow by the sun, to do observance\r\nTo flowery May, in Dian’s wood.—Wait well, sir,\r\nUpon your mistress.—Emily, I hope\r\nHe shall not go afoot.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nThat were a shame, sir,\r\nWhile I have horses.—Take your choice, and what\r\nYou want at any time, let me but know it.\r\nIf you serve faithfully, I dare assure you\r\nYou’ll find a loving mistress.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nIf I do not,\r\nLet me find that my father ever hated,\r\nDisgrace and blows.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nGo lead the way; you have won it.\r\nIt shall be so; you shall receive all dues\r\nFit for the honour you have won; ’twere wrong else.\r\nSister, beshrew my heart, you have a servant,\r\nThat, if I were a woman, would be master.\r\nBut you are wise.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nI hope too wise for that, sir.\r\n\r\n[_Flourish. Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE VI. Athens. Before the prison\r\n\r\nEnter Jailer’s Daughter alone.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nLet all the dukes and all the devils roar,\r\nHe is at liberty! I have ventured for him\r\nAnd out I have brought him; to a little wood\r\nA mile hence I have sent him, where a cedar\r\nHigher than all the rest spreads like a plane\r\nFast by a brook, and there he shall keep close\r\nTill I provide him files and food, for yet\r\nHis iron bracelets are not off. O Love,\r\nWhat a stout-hearted child thou art! My father\r\nDurst better have endured cold iron than done it.\r\nI love him beyond love and beyond reason,\r\nOr wit, or safety. I have made him know it;\r\nI care not, I am desperate. If the law\r\nFind me and then condemn me for ’t, some wenches,\r\nSome honest-hearted maids, will sing my dirge\r\nAnd tell to memory my death was noble,\r\nDying almost a martyr. That way he takes,\r\nI purpose is my way too. Sure he cannot\r\nBe so unmanly as to leave me here.\r\nIf he do, maids will not so easily\r\nTrust men again. And yet he has not thanked me\r\nFor what I have done; no, not so much as kissed me,\r\nAnd that, methinks, is not so well; nor scarcely\r\nCould I persuade him to become a free man,\r\nHe made such scruples of the wrong he did\r\nTo me and to my father. Yet I hope,\r\nWhen he considers more, this love of mine\r\nWill take more root within him. Let him do\r\nWhat he will with me, so he use me kindly;\r\nFor use me so he shall, or I’ll proclaim him,\r\nAnd to his face, no man. I’ll presently\r\nProvide him necessaries and pack my clothes up,\r\nAnd where there is a path of ground I’ll venture,\r\nSo he be with me. By him, like a shadow\r\nI’ll ever dwell. Within this hour the hubbub\r\nWill be all o’er the prison. I am then\r\nKissing the man they look for. Farewell, father!\r\nGet many more such prisoners and such daughters,\r\nAnd shortly you may keep yourself. Now to him.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\nACT III\r\n\r\nSCENE I. A forest near Athens\r\n\nCornets in sundry places. Noise and hallowing as people a-Maying. Enter\r\nArcite alone.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nThe Duke has lost Hippolyta; each took\r\nA several land. This is a solemn rite\r\nThey owe bloomed May, and the Athenians pay it\r\nTo th’ heart of ceremony. O Queen Emilia,\r\nFresher than May, sweeter\r\nThan her gold buttons on the boughs, or all\r\nTh’ enameled knacks o’ th’ mead or garden—yea,\r\nWe challenge too the bank of any nymph\r\nThat makes the stream seem flowers; thou, O jewel\r\nO’ th’ wood, o’ th’ world, hast likewise blessed a pace\r\nWith thy sole presence. In thy rumination\r\nThat I, poor man, might eftsoons come between\r\nAnd chop on some cold thought! Thrice blessed chance\r\nTo drop on such a mistress, expectation\r\nMost guiltless on ’t. Tell me, O Lady Fortune,\r\nNext after Emily my sovereign, how far\r\nI may be proud. She takes strong note of me,\r\nHath made me near her, and this beauteous morn,\r\nThe prim’st of all the year, presents me with\r\nA brace of horses; two such steeds might well\r\nBe by a pair of kings backed, in a field\r\nThat their crowns’ titles tried. Alas, alas,\r\nPoor cousin Palamon, poor prisoner, thou\r\nSo little dream’st upon my fortune that\r\nThou think’st thyself the happier thing, to be\r\nSo near Emilia; me thou deem’st at Thebes,\r\nAnd therein wretched, although free. But if\r\nThou knew’st my mistress breathed on me, and that\r\nI eared her language, lived in her eye, O coz,\r\nWhat passion would enclose thee!\r\n\r\nEnter Palamon as out of a bush, with his shackles; he bends his fist at\r\nArcite.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nTraitor kinsman,\r\nThou shouldst perceive my passion, if these signs\r\nOf prisonment were off me, and this hand\r\nBut owner of a sword. By all oaths in one,\r\nI and the justice of my love would make thee\r\nA confessed traitor! O thou most perfidious\r\nThat ever gently looked, the void’st of honour\r\nThat e’er bore gentle token, falsest cousin\r\nThat ever blood made kin! Call’st thou her thine?\r\nI’ll prove it in my shackles, with these hands,\r\nVoid of appointment, that thou liest, and art\r\nA very thief in love, a chaffy lord,\r\nNor worth the name of villain. Had I a sword,\r\nAnd these house-clogs away—\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nDear cousin Palamon—\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nCozener Arcite, give me language such\r\nAs thou hast showed me feat.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nNot finding in\r\nThe circuit of my breast any gross stuff\r\nTo form me like your blazon holds me to\r\nThis gentleness of answer. ’Tis your passion\r\nThat thus mistakes, the which, to you being enemy,\r\nCannot to me be kind. Honour and honesty\r\nI cherish and depend on, howsoe’er\r\nYou skip them in me, and with them, fair coz,\r\nI’ll maintain my proceedings. Pray be pleased\r\nTo show in generous terms your griefs, since that\r\nYour question’s with your equal, who professes\r\nTo clear his own way with the mind and sword\r\nOf a true gentleman.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nThat thou durst, Arcite!\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nMy coz, my coz, you have been well advertised\r\nHow much I dare; you’ve seen me use my sword\r\nAgainst th’ advice of fear. Sure, of another\r\nYou would not hear me doubted, but your silence\r\nShould break out, though i’ th’ sanctuary.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nSir,\r\nI have seen you move in such a place, which well\r\nMight justify your manhood; you were called\r\nA good knight and a bold. But the whole week’s not fair\r\nIf any day it rain. Their valiant temper\r\nMen lose when they incline to treachery;\r\nAnd then they fight like compelled bears, would fly\r\nWere they not tied.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nKinsman, you might as well\r\nSpeak this and act it in your glass as to\r\nHis ear which now disdains you.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nCome up to me;\r\nQuit me of these cold gyves, give me a sword\r\nThough it be rusty, and the charity\r\nOf one meal lend me. Come before me then,\r\nA good sword in thy hand, and do but say\r\nThat Emily is thine, I will forgive\r\nThe trespass thou hast done me, yea, my life,\r\nIf then thou carry ’t; and brave souls in shades\r\nThat have died manly, which will seek of me\r\nSome news from earth, they shall get none but this:\r\nThat thou art brave and noble.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nBe content.\r\nAgain betake you to your hawthorn house.\r\nWith counsel of the night, I will be here\r\nWith wholesome viands. These impediments\r\nWill I file off; you shall have garments and\r\nPerfumes to kill the smell o’ th’ prison. After,\r\nWhen you shall stretch yourself and say but “Arcite,\r\nI am in plight,” there shall be at your choice\r\nBoth sword and armour.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nOh you heavens, dares any\r\nSo noble bear a guilty business? None\r\nBut only Arcite, therefore none but Arcite\r\nIn this kind is so bold.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nSweet Palamon.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nI do embrace you and your offer; for\r\nYour offer do ’t I only, sir; your person,\r\nWithout hypocrisy I may not wish\r\nMore than my sword’s edge on ’t.\r\n\r\n[_Wind horns of cornets._]\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nYou hear the horns.\r\nEnter your musit, lest this match between ’s\r\nBe crossed ere met. Give me your hand; farewell.\r\nI’ll bring you every needful thing. I pray you,\r\nTake comfort and be strong.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nPray hold your promise,\r\nAnd do the deed with a bent brow. Most certain\r\nYou love me not; be rough with me, and pour\r\nThis oil out of your language. By this air,\r\nI could for each word give a cuff, my stomach\r\nNot reconciled by reason.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nPlainly spoken.\r\nYet pardon me hard language. When I spur\r\nMy horse, I chide him not; content and anger\r\nIn me have but one face.\r\n\r\n[_Wind horns._]\r\n\r\nHark, sir, they call\r\nThe scattered to the banquet. You must guess\r\nI have an office there.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nSir, your attendance\r\nCannot please heaven, and I know your office\r\nUnjustly is achieved.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\n’Tis a good title.\r\nI am persuaded, this question, sick between ’s,\r\nBy bleeding must be cured. I am a suitor\r\nThat to your sword you will bequeath this plea,\r\nAnd talk of it no more.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nBut this one word:\r\nYou are going now to gaze upon my mistress,\r\nFor, note you, mine she is—\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nNay, then—\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nNay, pray you,\r\nYou talk of feeding me to breed me strength.\r\nYou are going now to look upon a sun\r\nThat strengthens what it looks on; there\r\nYou have a vantage o’er me. But enjoy ’t till\r\nI may enforce my remedy. Farewell.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. Another Part of the forest\r\n\r\nEnter Jailer’s Daughter alone.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nHe has mistook the brake I meant, is gone\r\nAfter his fancy. ’Tis now well-nigh morning.\r\nNo matter; would it were perpetual night,\r\nAnd darkness lord o’ th’ world. Hark, ’tis a wolf!\r\nIn me hath grief slain fear, and but for one thing,\r\nI care for nothing, and that’s Palamon.\r\nI reck not if the wolves would jaw me, so\r\nHe had this file. What if I hallowed for him?\r\nI cannot hallow. If I whooped, what then?\r\nIf he not answered, I should call a wolf,\r\nAnd do him but that service. I have heard\r\nStrange howls this livelong night; why may ’t not be\r\nThey have made prey of him? He has no weapons;\r\nHe cannot run; the jingling of his gyves\r\nMight call fell things to listen, who have in them\r\nA sense to know a man unarmed and can\r\nSmell where resistance is. I’ll set it down\r\nHe’s torn to pieces; they howled many together,\r\nAnd then they fed on him. So much for that.\r\nBe bold to ring the bell. How stand I then?\r\nAll’s chared when he is gone. No, no, I lie.\r\nMy father’s to be hanged for his escape;\r\nMyself to beg, if I prized life so much\r\nAs to deny my act; but that I would not,\r\nShould I try death by dozens. I am moped.\r\nFood took I none these two days;\r\nSipped some water. I have not closed mine eyes\r\nSave when my lids scoured off their brine. Alas,\r\nDissolve, my life! Let not my sense unsettle,\r\nLest I should drown, or stab, or hang myself.\r\nO state of nature, fail together in me,\r\nSince thy best props are warped! So, which way now?\r\nThe best way is the next way to a grave;\r\nEach errant step beside is torment. Lo,\r\nThe moon is down, the crickets chirp, the screech owl\r\nCalls in the dawn. All offices are done\r\nSave what I fail in. But the point is this:\r\nAn end, and that is all.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. The same part of the forest as in scene I.\r\n\r\nEnter Arcite with meat, wine and files.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nI should be near the place.—Ho! Cousin Palamon!\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\n[_From the bush._] Arcite?\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nThe same. I have brought you food and files.\r\nCome forth and fear not; here’s no Theseus.\r\n\r\nEnter Palamon.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nNor none so honest, Arcite.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nThat’s no matter.\r\nWe’ll argue that hereafter. Come, take courage;\r\nYou shall not die thus beastly. Here, sir, drink—\r\nI know you are faint—then I’ll talk further with you.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nArcite, thou mightst now poison me.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nI might;\r\nBut I must fear you first. Sit down and, good now,\r\nNo more of these vain parleys; let us not,\r\nHaving our ancient reputation with us,\r\nMake talk for fools and cowards. To your health.\r\n\r\n[_Drinks._]\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nDo.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nPray sit down, then, and let me entreat you,\r\nBy all the honesty and honour in you,\r\nNo mention of this woman; ’twill disturb us.\r\nWe shall have time enough.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nWell, sir, I’ll pledge you.\r\n\r\n[_Drinks._]\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nDrink a good hearty draught; it breeds good blood, man.\r\nDo not you feel it thaw you?\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nStay, I’ll tell you\r\nAfter a draught or two more.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nSpare it not; the Duke has more, coz. Eat now.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n[_Eats._]\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nI am glad you have so good a stomach.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nI am gladder I have so good meat to ’t.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nIs’t not mad lodging,\r\nHere in the wild woods, cousin?\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nYes, for them\r\nThat have wild consciences.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nHow tastes your victuals?\r\nYour hunger needs no sauce, I see.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nNot much.\r\nBut if it did, yours is too tart, sweet cousin.\r\nWhat is this?\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nVenison.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\n’Tis a lusty meat.\r\nGive me more wine. Here, Arcite, to the wenches\r\nWe have known in our days! The Lord Steward’s daughter,\r\nDo you remember her?\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nAfter you, coz.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nShe loved a black-haired man.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nShe did so; well, sir?\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nAnd I have heard some call him Arcite, and—\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nOut with’t, faith.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nShe met him in an arbour.\r\nWhat did she there, coz? Play o’ th’ virginals?\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nSomething she did, sir.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nMade her groan a month for ’t,\r\nOr two, or three, or ten.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nThe Marshal’s sister\r\nHad her share too, as I remember, cousin,\r\nElse there be tales abroad. You’ll pledge her?\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nA pretty brown wench ’tis. There was a time\r\nWhen young men went a-hunting, and a wood,\r\nAnd a broad beech; and thereby hangs a tale.\r\nHeigh ho!\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nFor Emily, upon my life! Fool,\r\nAway with this strained mirth! I say again\r\nThat sigh was breathed for Emily. Base cousin,\r\nDar’st thou break first?\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nYou are wide.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nBy heaven and earth,\r\nThere’s nothing in thee honest.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nThen I’ll leave you.\r\nYou are a beast now.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nAs thou mak’st me, traitor.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nThere’s all things needful: files and shirts and perfumes.\r\nI’ll come again some two hours hence, and bring\r\nThat that shall quiet all.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nA sword and armour?\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nFear me not. You are now too foul. Farewell.\r\nGet off your trinkets; you shall want naught.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nSirrah—\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nI’ll hear no more.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nIf he keep touch, he dies for ’t.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV. Another part of the forest\r\n\r\nEnter Jailer’s Daughter.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nI am very cold, and all the stars are out too,\r\nThe little stars and all, that look like aglets.\r\nThe sun has seen my folly. Palamon!\r\nAlas, no; he’s in heaven. Where am I now?\r\nYonder’s the sea, and there’s a ship; how ’t tumbles!\r\nAnd there’s a rock lies watching under water;\r\nNow, now, it beats upon it; now, now, now,\r\nThere’s a leak sprung, a sound one! How they cry!\r\nRun her before the wind, you’ll lose all else.\r\nUp with a course or two, and tack about, boys!\r\nGood night, good night; you’re gone. I am very hungry.\r\nWould I could find a fine frog; he would tell me\r\nNews from all parts o’ th’ world; then would I make\r\nA carrack of a cockle shell, and sail\r\nBy east and north-east to the king of pygmies,\r\nFor he tells fortunes rarely. Now my father,\r\nTwenty to one, is trussed up in a trice\r\nTomorrow morning. I’ll say never a word.\r\n\r\n[_Sings._]\r\n\r\n_For I’ll cut my green coat a foot above my knee,\r\nAnd I’ll clip my yellow locks an inch below mine eye.\r\nHey nonny, nonny, nonny.\r\nHe’s buy me a white cut, forth for to ride,\r\nAnd I’ll go seek him through the world that is so wide.\r\nHey nonny, nonny, nonny._\r\nO, for a prick now, like a nightingale,\r\nTo put my breast against. I shall sleep like a top else.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE V.

Have my rudiments\r\nBeen laboured so long with ye, milked unto ye,\r\nAnd, by a figure, even the very plum-broth\r\nAnd marrow of my understanding laid upon ye,\r\nAnd do you still cry “Where?” and “How?” and “Wherefore?”\r\nYou most coarse-frieze capacities, ye jean judgements,\r\nHave I said “Thus let be” and “There let be”\r\nAnd “Then let be” and no man understand me?\r\n_Proh Deum, medius fidius_, ye are all dunces!\r\nFor why?\r\nHere stand I; here the Duke comes; there are you,\r\nClose in the thicket; the Duke appears; I meet him\r\nAnd unto him I utter learned things\r\nAnd many figures; he hears, and nods, and hums,\r\nAnd then cries “Rare!” and I go forward. At length\r\nI fling my cap up—mark there! Then do you\r\nAs once did Meleager and the boar,\r\nBreak comely out before him; like true lovers,\r\nCast yourselves in a body decently,\r\nAnd sweetly, by a figure, trace and turn, boys.\r\n\r\nFIRST COUNTRYMAN.\r\nAnd sweetly we will do it, Master Gerald.\r\n\r\nSECOND COUNTRYMAN.\r\nDraw up the company.

If he fail,\r\nHe’s neither man nor soldier. When he left me,\r\nI did not think a week could have restored\r\nMy lost strength to me, I was grown so low\r\nAnd crestfall’n with my wants. I thank thee, Arcite,\r\nThou art yet a fair foe, and I feel myself,\r\nWith this refreshing, able once again\r\nTo outdure danger. To delay it longer\r\nWould make the world think, when it comes to hearing,\r\nThat I lay fatting like a swine to fight\r\nAnd not a soldier. Therefore, this blest morning\r\nShall be the last; and that sword he refuses,\r\nIf it but hold, I kill him with. ’Tis justice.\r\nSo, love and fortune for me!\r\n\r\nEnter Arcite with armours and swords.\r\n\r\nO, good morrow.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nGood morrow, noble kinsman.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nI have put you\r\nTo too much pains, sir.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nThat too much, fair cousin,\r\nIs but a debt to honour, and my duty.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nWould you were so in all, sir; I could wish ye\r\nAs kind a kinsman as you force me find\r\nA beneficial foe, that my embraces\r\nMight thank ye, not my blows.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nI shall think either,\r\nWell done, a noble recompence.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nThen I shall quit you.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nDefy me in these fair terms, and you show\r\nMore than a mistress to me. No more anger,\r\nAs you love anything that’s honourable!\r\nWe were not bred to talk, man; when we are armed\r\nAnd both upon our guards, then let our fury,\r\nLike meeting of two tides, fly strongly from us;\r\nAnd then to whom the birthright of this beauty\r\nTruly pertains—without upbraidings, scorns,\r\nDespisings of our persons, and such poutings,\r\nFitter for girls and schoolboys—will be seen,\r\nAnd quickly, yours or mine. Will ’t please you arm, sir?\r\nOr, if you feel yourself not fitting yet\r\nAnd furnished with your old strength, I’ll stay, cousin,\r\nAnd every day discourse you into health,\r\nAs I am spared. Your person I am friends with,\r\nAnd I could wish I had not said I loved her,\r\nThough I had died; but, loving such a lady,\r\nAnd justifying my love, I must not fly from ’t.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nArcite, thou art so brave an enemy,\r\nThat no man but thy cousin’s fit to kill thee.\r\nI am well and lusty; choose your arms.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nChoose you, sir.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nWilt thou exceed in all, or dost thou do it\r\nTo make me spare thee?\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nIf you think so, cousin,\r\nYou are deceived, for as I am a soldier,\r\nI will not spare you.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nThat’s well said.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nYou’ll find it.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nThen, as I am an honest man and love\r\nWith all the justice of affection,\r\nI’ll pay thee soundly.\r\n\r\n[_He chooses armour._]\r\n\r\nThis I’ll take.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nThat’s mine, then.\r\nI’ll arm you first.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nDo.\r\n\r\n[_Arcite begins arming him._]\r\n\r\nPray thee, tell me, cousin,\r\nWhere got’st thou this good armour?\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\n’Tis the Duke’s,\r\nAnd, to say true, I stole it. Do I pinch you?\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nIs’t not too heavy?\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nI have worn a lighter,\r\nBut I shall make it serve.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nI’ll buckle ’t close.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nBy any means.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nYou care not for a grand guard?\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nNo, no; we’ll use no horses: I perceive\r\nYou would fain be at that fight.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nI am indifferent.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nFaith, so am I. Good cousin, thrust the buckle\r\nThrough far enough.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nI warrant you.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nMy casque now.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nWill you fight bare-armed?\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nWe shall be the nimbler.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nBut use your gauntlets though. Those are o’ th’ least;\r\nPrithee take mine, good cousin.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nThank you, Arcite.\r\nHow do I look? Am I fall’n much away?\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nFaith, very little; love has used you kindly.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nI’ll warrant thee, I’ll strike home.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nDo, and spare not.\r\nI’ll give you cause, sweet cousin.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nNow to you, sir.\r\n\r\n[_He begins to arm Arcite._]\r\n\r\nMethinks this armour’s very like that, Arcite,\r\nThou wor’st that day the three kings fell, but lighter.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nThat was a very good one; and that day,\r\nI well remember, you outdid me, cousin;\r\nI never saw such valour. When you charged\r\nUpon the left wing of the enemy,\r\nI spurred hard to come up, and under me\r\nI had a right good horse.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nYou had indeed;\r\nA bright bay, I remember.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nYes, but all\r\nWas vainly laboured in me; you outwent me,\r\nNor could my wishes reach you. Yet a little\r\nI did by imitation.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nMore by virtue;\r\nYou are modest, cousin.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nWhen I saw you charge first,\r\nMe thought I heard a dreadful clap of thunder\r\nBreak from the troop.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nBut still before that flew\r\nThe lightning of your valour. Stay a little;\r\nIs not this piece too strait?\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nNo, no, ’tis well.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nI would have nothing hurt thee but my sword.\r\nA bruise would be dishonour.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nNow I am perfect.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nStand off, then.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nTake my sword; I hold it better.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nI thank ye, no; keep it; your life lies on it.\r\nHere’s one; if it but hold, I ask no more\r\nFor all my hopes. My cause and honour guard me!\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nAnd me my love!\r\n\r\n[_They bow several ways, then advance and stand._]\r\n\r\nIs there aught else to say?\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nThis only, and no more. Thou art mine aunt’s son.\r\nAnd that blood we desire to shed is mutual,\r\nIn me thine, and in thee mine. My sword\r\nIs in my hand, and if thou killest me,\r\nThe gods and I forgive thee. If there be\r\nA place prepared for those that sleep in honour,\r\nI wish his weary soul that falls may win it.\r\nFight bravely, cousin; give me thy noble hand.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nHere, Palamon. This hand shall never more\r\nCome near thee with such friendship.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nI commend thee.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nIf I fall, curse me, and say I was a coward,\r\nFor none but such dare die in these just trials.\r\nOnce more farewell, my cousin.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nFarewell, Arcite.\r\n\r\n[_They fight.

O, retire,\r\nFor honour’s sake and safety, presently\r\nInto your bush again. Sir, we shall find\r\nToo many hours to die in. Gentle cousin,\r\nIf you be seen, you perish instantly\r\nFor breaking prison and I, if you reveal me,\r\nFor my contempt. Then all the world will scorn us,\r\nAnd say we had a noble difference,\r\nBut base disposers of it.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nNo, no, cousin,\r\nI will no more be hidden, nor put off\r\nThis great adventure to a second trial;\r\nI know your cunning and I know your cause.\r\nHe that faints now, shame take him! Put thyself\r\nUpon thy present guard—\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nYou are not mad?\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nOr I will make th’advantage of this hour\r\nMine own, and what to come shall threaten me\r\nI fear less than my fortune. Know, weak cousin,\r\nI love Emilia, and in that I’ll bury\r\nThee, and all crosses else.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nThen, come what can come,\r\nThou shalt know, Palamon, I dare as well\r\nDie, as discourse, or sleep. Only this fears me,\r\nThe law will have the honour of our ends.\r\nHave at thy life!\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nLook to thine own well, Arcite.\r\n\r\n[_They fight. Horns within. They stand._]\r\n\r\nEnter Theseus, Hippolyta, Emilia, Pirithous and train.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nWhat ignorant and mad malicious traitors\r\nAre you, that ’gainst the tenor of my laws\r\nAre making battle, thus like knights appointed,\r\nWithout my leave, and officers of arms?\r\nBy Castor, both shall die.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nHold thy word, Theseus.\r\nWe are certainly both traitors, both despisers\r\nOf thee and of thy goodness. I am Palamon,\r\nThat cannot love thee, he that broke thy prison.\r\nThink well what that deserves. And this is Arcite.\r\nA bolder traitor never trod thy ground,\r\nA falser ne’er seemed friend. This is the man\r\nWas begged and banished; this is he contemns thee\r\nAnd what thou dar’st do; and in this disguise,\r\nAgainst thine own edict, follows thy sister,\r\nThat fortunate bright star, the fair Emilia,\r\nWhose servant—if there be a right in seeing\r\nAnd first bequeathing of the soul to—justly\r\nI am; and, which is more, dares think her his.\r\nThis treachery, like a most trusty lover,\r\nI called him now to answer. If thou be’st\r\nAs thou art spoken, great and virtuous,\r\nThe true decider of all injuries,\r\nSay “Fight again,” and thou shalt see me, Theseus,\r\nDo such a justice thou thyself wilt envy.\r\nThen take my life; I’ll woo thee to ’t.\r\n\r\nPIRITHOUS.\r\nO heaven,\r\nWhat more than man is this!\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nI have sworn.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nWe seek not\r\nThy breath of mercy, Theseus. ’Tis to me\r\nA thing as soon to die as thee to say it,\r\nAnd no more moved. Where this man calls me traitor,\r\nLet me say thus much: if in love be treason,\r\nIn service of so excellent a beauty,\r\nAs I love most, and in that faith will perish,\r\nAs I have brought my life here to confirm it,\r\nAs I have served her truest, worthiest,\r\nAs I dare kill this cousin that denies it,\r\nSo let me be most traitor, and you please me.\r\nFor scorning thy edict, Duke, ask that lady\r\nWhy she is fair, and why her eyes command me\r\nStay here to love her; and if she say “traitor,”\r\nI am a villain fit to lie unburied.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nThou shalt have pity of us both, O Theseus,\r\nIf unto neither thou show mercy. Stop,\r\nAs thou art just, thy noble ear against us;\r\nAs thou art valiant, for thy cousin’s soul,\r\nWhose twelve strong labours crown his memory,\r\nLet’s die together at one instant, Duke;\r\nOnly a little let him fall before me,\r\nThat I may tell my soul he shall not have her.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nI grant your wish, for, to say true, your cousin\r\nHas ten times more offended, for I gave him\r\nMore mercy than you found, sir, your offences\r\nBeing no more than his. None here speak for ’em,\r\nFor, ere the sun set, both shall sleep for ever.\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA.\r\nAlas the pity! Now or never, sister,\r\nSpeak, not to be denied. That face of yours\r\nWill bear the curses else of after ages\r\nFor these lost cousins.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nIn my face, dear sister,\r\nI find no anger to ’em, nor no ruin;\r\nThe misadventure of their own eyes kill ’em.\r\nYet that I will be woman and have pity,\r\nMy knees shall grow to’ th’ ground but I’ll get mercy.\r\n\r\n[_She kneels._]\r\n\r\nHelp me, dear sister; in a deed so virtuous\r\nThe powers of all women will be with us.\r\nMost royal brother—\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA.\r\n[_Kneels._] Sir, by our tie of marriage—\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nBy your own spotless honour—\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA.\r\nBy that faith,\r\nThat fair hand, and that honest heart you gave me—\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nBy that you would have pity in another,\r\nBy your own virtues infinite—\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA.\r\nBy valour,\r\nBy all the chaste nights I have ever pleased you—\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nThese are strange conjurings.\r\n\r\nPIRITHOUS.\r\nNay, then, I’ll in too.\r\n\r\n[_Kneels._]\r\n\r\nBy all our friendship, sir, by all our dangers,\r\nBy all you love most: wars and this sweet lady—\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nBy that you would have trembled to deny\r\nA blushing maid—\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA.\r\nBy your own eyes, by strength,\r\nIn which you swore I went beyond all women,\r\nAlmost all men, and yet I yielded, Theseus—\r\n\r\nPIRITHOUS.\r\nTo crown all this, by your most noble soul,\r\nWhich cannot want due mercy, I beg first.\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA.\r\nNext, hear my prayers.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nLast, let me entreat, sir.\r\n\r\nPIRITHOUS.\r\nFor mercy.\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA.\r\nMercy.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nMercy on these princes.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nYe make my faith reel.

But with their banishments.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nYou are a right woman, sister: you have pity,\r\nBut want the understanding where to use it.\r\nIf you desire their lives, invent a way\r\nSafer than banishment. Can these two live,\r\nAnd have the agony of love about ’em,\r\nAnd not kill one another? Every day\r\nThey’d fight about you, hourly bring your honour\r\nIn public question with their swords. Be wise, then,\r\nAnd here forget ’em; it concerns your credit\r\nAnd my oath equally. I have said they die.\r\nBetter they fall by th’ law than one another.\r\nBow not my honour.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nO, my noble brother,\r\nThat oath was rashly made, and in your anger;\r\nYour reason will not hold it; if such vows\r\nStand for express will, all the world must perish.\r\nBesides, I have another oath ’gainst yours,\r\nOf more authority, I am sure more love,\r\nNot made in passion neither, but good heed.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nWhat is it, sister?\r\n\r\nPIRITHOUS.\r\nUrge it home, brave lady.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nThat you would ne’er deny me anything\r\nFit for my modest suit and your free granting.\r\nI tie you to your word now; if ye fail in ’t,\r\nThink how you maim your honour—\r\nFor now I am set a-begging, sir, I am deaf\r\nTo all but your compassion—how their lives\r\nMight breed the ruin of my name. Opinion!\r\nShall anything that loves me perish for me?\r\nThat were a cruel wisdom. Do men prune\r\nThe straight young boughs that blush with thousand blossoms\r\nBecause they may be rotten? O, Duke Theseus,\r\nThe goodly mothers that have groaned for these,\r\nAnd all the longing maids that ever loved,\r\nIf your vow stand, shall curse me and my beauty,\r\nAnd in their funeral songs for these two cousins\r\nDespise my cruelty, and cry woe worth me,\r\nTill I am nothing but the scorn of women.\r\nFor heaven’s sake, save their lives, and banish ’em.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nOn what conditions?\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nSwear ’em never more\r\nTo make me their contention, or to know me,\r\nTo tread upon thy dukedom, and to be,\r\nWherever they shall travel, ever strangers\r\nTo one another.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nI’ll be cut a-pieces\r\nBefore I take this oath! Forget I love her?\r\nO, all ye gods, despise me then! Thy banishment\r\nI not mislike, so we may fairly carry\r\nOur swords and cause along; else never trifle,\r\nBut take our lives, Duke. I must love, and will\r\nAnd for that love must and dare kill this cousin\r\nOn any piece the earth has.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nWill you, Arcite,\r\nTake these conditions?\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nHe’s a villain, then.\r\n\r\nPIRITHOUS.\r\nThese are men!\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nNo, never, Duke. ’Tis worse to me than begging\r\nTo take my life so basely. Though I think\r\nI never shall enjoy her, yet I’ll preserve\r\nThe honour of affection, and die for her,\r\nMake death a devil.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nWhat may be done? For now I feel compassion.\r\n\r\nPIRITHOUS.\r\nLet it not fall again, sir.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nSay, Emilia,\r\nIf one of them were dead, as one must, are you\r\nContent to take th’ other to your husband?\r\nThey cannot both enjoy you. They are princes\r\nAs goodly as your own eyes, and as noble\r\nAs ever fame yet spoke of. Look upon ’em,\r\nAnd, if you can love, end this difference;\r\nI give consent.—Are you content too, princes?\r\n\r\nBOTH.\r\nWith all our souls.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nHe that she refuses\r\nMust die, then.\r\n\r\nBOTH.\r\nAny death thou canst invent, Duke.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nIf I fall from that mouth, I fall with favour,\r\nAnd lovers yet unborn shall bless my ashes.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nIf she refuse me, yet my grave will wed me,\r\nAnd soldiers sing my epitaph.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nMake choice, then.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nI cannot, sir, they are both too excellent;\r\nFor me, a hair shall never fall of these men.\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA.\r\nWhat will become of ’em?\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nThus I ordain it\r\nAnd, by mine honour, once again, it stands,\r\nOr both shall die. You shall both to your country,\r\nAnd each within this month, accompanied\r\nWith three fair knights, appear again in this place,\r\nIn which I’ll plant a pyramid; and whether,\r\nBefore us that are here, can force his cousin\r\nBy fair and knightly strength to touch the pillar,\r\nHe shall enjoy her; th’ other lose his head,\r\nAnd all his friends; nor shall he grudge to fall,\r\nNor think he dies with interest in this lady.\r\nWill this content ye?\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nYes. Here, cousin Arcite,\r\nI am friends again, till that hour.\r\n\r\n[_He offers his hand._]\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nI embrace ye.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nAre you content, sister?\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nYes, I must, sir,\r\nElse both miscarry.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nCome, shake hands again, then;\r\nAnd take heed, as you are gentlemen, this quarrel\r\nSleep till the hour prefixed, and hold your course.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nWe dare not fail thee, Theseus.\r\n\r\n[_They shake hands._]\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nCome, I’ll give ye\r\nNow usage like to princes, and to friends.\r\nWhen ye return, who wins, I’ll settle here;\r\nWho loses, yet I’ll weep upon his bier.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\nACT IV\r\n\r\nSCENE I. Athens. A room in the prison\r\n\nEnter Jailer and his Friend.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nHear you no more? Was nothing said of me\r\nConcerning the escape of Palamon?\r\nGood sir, remember.\r\n\r\nFIRST FRIEND.\r\nNothing that I heard,\r\nFor I came home before the business\r\nWas fully ended. Yet I might perceive,\r\nEre I departed, a great likelihood\r\nOf both their pardons; for Hippolyta\r\nAnd fair-eyed Emily, upon their knees,\r\nBegged with such handsome pity that the Duke\r\nMethought stood staggering whether he should follow\r\nHis rash oath or the sweet compassion\r\nOf those two ladies. And, to second them,\r\nThat truly noble prince, Pirithous,\r\nHalf his own heart, set in too, that I hope\r\nAll shall be well. Neither heard I one question\r\nOf your name or his ’scape.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nPray heaven it hold so.\r\n\r\nEnter Second Friend.\r\n\r\nSECOND FRIEND.\r\nBe of good comfort, man; I bring you news,\r\nGood news.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nThey are welcome.\r\n\r\nSECOND FRIEND.\r\nPalamon has cleared you,\r\nAnd got your pardon, and discovered how\r\nAnd by whose means he escaped, which was your daughter’s,\r\nWhose pardon is procured too; and the prisoner,\r\nNot to be held ungrateful to her goodness,\r\nHas given a sum of money to her marriage,\r\nA large one, I’ll assure you.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nYou are a good man\r\nAnd ever bring good news.\r\n\r\nFIRST FRIEND.\r\nHow was it ended?\r\n\r\nSECOND FRIEND.\r\nWhy, as it should be; they that never begged\r\nBut they prevailed had their suits fairly granted;\r\nThe prisoners have their lives.\r\n\r\nFIRST FRIEND.\r\nI knew ’twould be so.\r\n\r\nSECOND FRIEND.\r\nBut there be new conditions, which you’ll hear of\r\nAt better time.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nI hope they are good.\r\n\r\nSECOND FRIEND.\r\nThey are honourable;\r\nHow good they’ll prove, I know not.\r\n\r\nFIRST FRIEND.\r\n’Twill be known.\r\n\r\nEnter Wooer.\r\n\r\nWOOER.\r\nAlas, sir, where’s your daughter?\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nWhy do you ask?\r\n\r\nWOOER.\r\nO, sir, when did you see her?\r\n\r\nSECOND FRIEND.\r\nHow he looks?\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nThis morning.\r\n\r\nWOOER.\r\nWas she well? Was she in health, sir?\r\nWhen did she sleep?\r\n\r\nFIRST FRIEND.\r\nThese are strange questions.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nI do not think she was very well, for now\r\nYou make me mind her, but this very day\r\nI asked her questions, and she answered me\r\nSo far from what she was, so childishly,\r\nSo sillily, as if she were a fool,\r\nAn innocent, and I was very angry.\r\nBut what of her, sir?\r\n\r\nWOOER.\r\nNothing but my pity.\r\nBut you must know it, and as good by me\r\nAs by another that less loves her.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nWell, sir?\r\n\r\nFIRST FRIEND.\r\nNot right?\r\n\r\nSECOND FRIEND.\r\nNot well?\r\n\r\nWOOER.\r\nNo, sir, not well:\r\n’Tis too true, she is mad.\r\n\r\nFIRST FRIEND.\r\nIt cannot be.\r\n\r\nWOOER.\r\nBelieve, you’ll find it so.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nI half suspected\r\nWhat you have told me. The gods comfort her!\r\nEither this was her love to Palamon,\r\nOr fear of my miscarrying on his ’scape,\r\nOr both.\r\n\r\nWOOER.\r\n’Tis likely.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nBut why all this haste, sir?\r\n\r\nWOOER.\r\nI’ll tell you quickly. As I late was angling\r\nIn the great lake that lies behind the palace,\r\nFrom the far shore, thick set with reeds and sedges,\r\nAs patiently I was attending sport,\r\nI heard a voice, a shrill one; and, attentive,\r\nI gave my ear, when I might well perceive\r\n’Twas one that sung, and by the smallness of it\r\nA boy or woman. I then left my angle\r\nTo his own skill, came near, but yet perceived not\r\nWho made the sound, the rushes and the reeds\r\nHad so encompassed it. I laid me down\r\nAnd listened to the words she sung, for then,\r\nThrough a small glade cut by the fishermen,\r\nI saw it was your daughter.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nPray, go on, sir.\r\n\r\nWOOER.\r\nShe sung much, but no sense; only I heard her\r\nRepeat this often: “Palamon is gone,\r\nIs gone to th’ wood to gather mulberries;\r\nI’ll find him out tomorrow.”\r\n\r\nFIRST FRIEND.\r\nPretty soul!\r\n\r\nWOOER.\r\n“His shackles will betray him; he’ll be taken,\r\nAnd what shall I do then? I’ll bring a bevy,\r\nA hundred black-eyed maids that love as I do,\r\nWith chaplets on their heads of daffadillies,\r\nWith cherry lips and cheeks of damask roses,\r\nAnd all we’ll dance an antic ’fore the Duke,\r\nAnd beg his pardon.” Then she talked of you, sir;\r\nThat you must lose your head tomorrow morning,\r\nAnd she must gather flowers to bury you,\r\nAnd see the house made handsome. Then she sung\r\nNothing but “Willow, willow, willow,” and between\r\nEver was “Palamon, fair Palamon,”\r\nAnd “Palamon was a tall young man.” The place\r\nWas knee-deep where she sat; her careless tresses,\r\nA wreath of bulrush rounded; about her stuck\r\nThousand fresh water-flowers of several colours,\r\nThat methought she appeared like the fair nymph\r\nThat feeds the lake with waters, or as Iris\r\nNewly dropped down from heaven. Rings she made\r\nOf rushes that grew by, and to ’em spoke\r\nThe prettiest posies: “Thus our true love’s tied,”\r\n“This you may loose, not me,” and many a one;\r\nAnd then she wept, and sung again, and sighed,\r\nAnd with the same breath smiled and kissed her hand.\r\n\r\nSECOND FRIEND.\r\nAlas, what pity it is!\r\n\r\nWOOER.\r\nI made in to her.\r\nShe saw me, and straight sought the flood. I saved her\r\nAnd set her safe to land, when presently\r\nShe slipped away, and to the city made\r\nWith such a cry and swiftness that, believe me,\r\nShe left me far behind her. Three or four\r\nI saw from far off cross her—one of ’em\r\nI knew to be your brother—where she stayed\r\nAnd fell, scarce to be got away. I left them with her\r\nAnd hither came to tell you.\r\n\r\nEnter Jailer’s Brother, Jailer’s Daughter and others.\r\n\r\nHere they are.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\n[_Sings_.]\r\n\r\n _May you never more enjoy the light, &c._\r\n\r\nIs not this a fine song?\r\n\r\nBROTHER.\r\nO, a very fine one.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nI can sing twenty more.\r\n\r\nBROTHER.\r\nI think you can.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nYes, truly can I. I can sing “The Broom”\r\nand “Bonny Robin.” Are not you a tailor?\r\n\r\nBROTHER.\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nWhere’s my wedding gown?\r\n\r\nBROTHER.\r\nI’ll bring it tomorrow.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nDo, very rarely, I must be abroad else\r\nTo call the maids and pay the minstrels,\r\nFor I must lose my maidenhead by cocklight.\r\n’Twill never thrive else.\r\n[_Sings_.] _O fair, O sweet, &c._\r\n\r\nBROTHER.\r\n[_To Jailer._] You must e’en take it patiently.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\n’Tis true.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nGood ev’n, good men; pray, did you ever hear\r\nOf one young Palamon?\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nYes, wench, we know him.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nIs’t not a fine young gentleman?\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\n’Tis, love.\r\n\r\nBROTHER.\r\nBy no means cross her; she is then distempered\r\nFar worse than now she shows.\r\n\r\nFIRST FRIEND.\r\nYes, he’s a fine man.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nO, is he so? You have a sister?\r\n\r\nFIRST FRIEND.\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nBut she shall never have him, tell her so,\r\nFor a trick that I know; you’d best look to her,\r\nFor if she see him once, she’s gone, she’s done,\r\nAnd undone in an hour. All the young maids\r\nOf our town are in love with him, but I laugh at ’em\r\nAnd let ’em all alone. Is ’t not a wise course?\r\n\r\nFIRST FRIEND.\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nThere is at least two hundred now with child by him—\r\nThere must be four; yet I keep close for all this,\r\nClose as a cockle; and all these must be boys\r\nHe has the trick on ’t; and at ten years old\r\nThey must be all gelt for musicians\r\nAnd sing the wars of Theseus.\r\n\r\nSECOND FRIEND.\r\nThis is strange.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nAs ever you heard, but say nothing.\r\n\r\nFIRST FRIEND.\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nThey come from all parts of the dukedom to him.\r\nI’ll warrant ye, he had not so few last night\r\nAs twenty to dispatch. He’ll tickle ’t up\r\nIn two hours, if his hand be in.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nShe’s lost\r\nPast all cure.\r\n\r\nBROTHER.\r\nHeaven forbid, man!\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nCome hither, you are a wise man.\r\n\r\nFIRST FRIEND.\r\n[_Aside._] Does she know him?\r\n\r\nSECOND FRIEND.\r\n[_Aside._] No, would she did.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nYou are master of a ship?\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nWhere’s your compass?\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nHere.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nSet it to th’ north.\r\nAnd now direct your course to th’ wood, where Palamon\r\nLies longing for me. For the tackling,\r\nLet me alone. Come, weigh, my hearts, cheerly.\r\n\r\nALL.\r\nOwgh, owgh, owgh! ’Tis up, the wind’s fair!\r\nTop the bowline; out with the mainsail;\r\nWhere’s your whistle, master?\r\n\r\nBROTHER.\r\nLet’s get her in.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nUp to the top, boy.\r\n\r\nBROTHER.\r\nWhere’s the pilot?\r\n\r\nFIRST FRIEND.\r\nHere.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nWhat kenn’st thou?\r\n\r\nSECOND FRIEND.\r\nA fair wood.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nBear for it, master. Tack about!\r\n[_Sings_.]\r\n _When Cinthia with her borrowed light, &c._\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. A Room in the Palace\r\n\r\nEnter Emilia alone, with two pictures.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nYet I may bind those wounds up, that must open\r\nAnd bleed to death for my sake else. I’ll choose,\r\nAnd end their strife. Two such young handsome men\r\nShall never fall for me; their weeping mothers,\r\nFollowing the dead cold ashes of their sons,\r\nShall never curse my cruelty.\r\n\r\n[_Looks at one of the pictures._]\r\n\r\nGood heaven,\r\nWhat a sweet face has Arcite! If wise Nature,\r\nWith all her best endowments, all those beauties\r\nShe sows into the births of noble bodies,\r\nWere here a mortal woman, and had in her\r\nThe coy denials of young maids, yet doubtless\r\nShe would run mad for this man. What an eye,\r\nOf what a fiery sparkle and quick sweetness,\r\nHas this young prince! Here Love himself sits smiling;\r\nJust such another wanton Ganymede\r\nSet Jove afire with, and enforced the god\r\nSnatch up the goodly boy and set him by him,\r\nA shining constellation. What a brow,\r\nOf what a spacious majesty, he carries,\r\nArched like the great-eyed Juno’s, but far sweeter,\r\nSmoother than Pelops’ shoulder! Fame and Honour,\r\nMethinks, from hence, as from a promontory\r\nPointed in heaven, should clap their wings and sing\r\nTo all the under-world the loves and fights\r\nOf gods and such men near ’em.\r\n\r\n[_Looks at the other picture._]\r\n\r\nPalamon\r\nIs but his foil; to him a mere dull shadow;\r\nHe’s swart and meagre, of an eye as heavy\r\nAs if he had lost his mother; a still temper,\r\nNo stirring in him, no alacrity;\r\nOf all this sprightly sharpness, not a smile.\r\nYet these that we count errors may become him;\r\nNarcissus was a sad boy but a heavenly.\r\nO, who can find the bent of woman’s fancy?\r\nI am a fool; my reason is lost in me;\r\nI have no choice, and I have lied so lewdly\r\nThat women ought to beat me. On my knees\r\nI ask thy pardon, Palamon, thou art alone\r\nAnd only beautiful, and these the eyes,\r\nThese the bright lamps of beauty, that command\r\nAnd threaten love, and what young maid dare cross ’em?\r\nWhat a bold gravity, and yet inviting,\r\nHas this brown manly face! O Love, this only\r\nFrom this hour is complexion. Lie there, Arcite.\r\n\r\n[_She puts aside his picture._]\r\n\r\nThou art a changeling to him, a mere gypsy,\r\nAnd this the noble body. I am sotted,\r\nUtterly lost. My virgin’s faith has fled me.\r\nFor if my brother but even now had asked me\r\nWhether I loved, I had run mad for Arcite;\r\nNow, if my sister, more for Palamon.\r\nStand both together. Now, come ask me, brother.\r\nAlas, I know not! Ask me now, sweet sister.\r\nI may go look! What a mere child is Fancy,\r\nThat, having two fair gauds of equal sweetness,\r\nCannot distinguish, but must cry for both.\r\n\r\nEnter a Gentleman.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nHow now, sir?\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nFrom the noble Duke your brother,\r\nMadam, I bring you news. The knights are come.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nTo end the quarrel?\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nWould I might end first!\r\nWhat sins have I committed, chaste Diana,\r\nThat my unspotted youth must now be soiled\r\nWith blood of princes, and my chastity\r\nBe made the altar where the lives of lovers—\r\nTwo greater and two better never yet\r\nMade mothers joy—must be the sacrifice\r\nTo my unhappy beauty?\r\n\r\nEnter Theseus, Hippolyta, Pirithous and Attendants.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nBring ’em in\r\nQuickly, by any means; I long to see ’em.\r\nYour two contending lovers are returned,\r\nAnd with them their fair knights. Now, my fair sister,\r\nYou must love one of them.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nI had rather both,\r\nSo neither for my sake should fall untimely.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nWho saw ’em?\r\n\r\nPIRITHOUS.\r\nI a while.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nAnd I.\r\n\r\nEnter Messenger.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nFrom whence come you, sir?\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nFrom the knights.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nPray, speak,\r\nYou that have seen them, what they are.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nI will, sir,\r\nAnd truly what I think. Six braver spirits\r\nThan these they have brought, if we judge by the outside,\r\nI never saw nor read of. He that stands\r\nIn the first place with Arcite, by his seeming\r\nShould be a stout man, by his face a prince,\r\nHis very looks so say him; his complexion\r\nNearer a brown than black, stern and yet noble,\r\nWhich shows him hardy, fearless, proud of dangers;\r\nThe circles of his eyes show fire within him,\r\nAnd as a heated lion so he looks.\r\nHis hair hangs long behind him, black and shining\r\nLike ravens’ wings; his shoulders broad and strong;\r\nArmed long and round; and on his thigh a sword\r\nHung by a curious baldric, when he frowns\r\nTo seal his will with. Better, o’ my conscience,\r\nWas never soldier’s friend.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nThou hast well described him.\r\n\r\nPIRITHOUS.\r\nYet a great deal short,\r\nMethinks, of him that’s first with Palamon.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nPray, speak him, friend.\r\n\r\nPIRITHOUS.\r\nI guess he is a prince too,\r\nAnd, if it may be, greater; for his show\r\nHas all the ornament of honour in ’t:\r\nHe’s somewhat bigger than the knight he spoke of,\r\nBut of a face far sweeter; his complexion\r\nIs, as a ripe grape, ruddy. He has felt\r\nWithout doubt what he fights for, and so apter\r\nTo make this cause his own. In ’s face appears\r\nAll the fair hopes of what he undertakes\r\nAnd when he’s angry, then a settled valour,\r\nNot tainted with extremes, runs through his body\r\nAnd guides his arm to brave things. Fear he cannot;\r\nHe shows no such soft temper. His head’s yellow,\r\nHard-haired and curled, thick-twined like ivy tods,\r\nNot to undo with thunder. In his face\r\nThe livery of the warlike maid appears,\r\nPure red and white, for yet no beard has blessed him;\r\nAnd in his rolling eyes sits Victory,\r\nAs if she ever meant to crown his valour.\r\nHis nose stands high, a character of honour;\r\nHis red lips, after fights, are fit for ladies.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nMust these men die too?\r\n\r\nPIRITHOUS.\r\nWhen he speaks, his tongue\r\nSounds like a trumpet. All his lineaments\r\nAre as a man would wish ’em, strong and clean.\r\nHe wears a well-steeled axe, the staff of gold;\r\nHis age some five-and-twenty.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nThere’s another,\r\nA little man, but of a tough soul, seeming\r\nAs great as any; fairer promises\r\nIn such a body yet I never looked on.\r\n\r\nPIRITHOUS.\r\nO, he that’s freckle-faced?\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nThe same, my lord;\r\nAre they not sweet ones?\r\n\r\nPIRITHOUS.\r\nYes, they are well.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nMethinks,\r\nBeing so few and well disposed, they show\r\nGreat and fine art in nature. He’s white-haired,\r\nNot wanton white, but such a manly colour\r\nNext to an auburn; tough and nimble-set,\r\nWhich shows an active soul. His arms are brawny,\r\nLined with strong sinews. To the shoulder-piece\r\nGently they swell, like women new-conceived,\r\nWhich speaks him prone to labour, never fainting\r\nUnder the weight of arms; stout-hearted still,\r\nBut when he stirs, a tiger. He’s grey-eyed,\r\nWhich yields compassion where he conquers; sharp\r\nTo spy advantages, and where he finds ’em,\r\nHe’s swift to make ’em his. He does no wrongs,\r\nNor takes none. He’s round-faced, and when he smiles\r\nHe shows a lover; when he frowns, a soldier.\r\nAbout his head he wears the winner’s oak,\r\nAnd in it stuck the favour of his lady.\r\nHis age some six-and-thirty. In his hand\r\nHe bears a charging-staff embossed with silver.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nAre they all thus?\r\n\r\nPIRITHOUS.\r\nThey are all the sons of honour.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nNow, as I have a soul, I long to see’em.\r\nLady, you shall see men fight now.\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA.\r\nI wish it,\r\nBut not the cause, my lord. They would show\r\nBravely about the titles of two kingdoms.\r\n’Tis pity love should be so tyrannous.—\r\nO, my soft-hearted sister, what think you?\r\nWeep not till they weep blood. Wench, it must be.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nYou have steeled ’em with your beauty.\r\nHonoured friend,\r\nTo you I give the field; pray order it\r\nFitting the persons that must use it.\r\n\r\nPIRITHOUS.\r\nYes, sir.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nCome, I’ll go visit ’em. I cannot stay,\r\nTheir fame has fired me so; till they appear.\r\nGood friend, be royal.\r\n\r\nPIRITHOUS.\r\nThere shall want no bravery.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt all but Emilia._]\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nPoor wench, go weep, for whosoever wins,\r\nLoses a noble cousin for thy sins.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. A room in the prison\r\n\r\nEnter Jailer, Wooer and Doctor.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nHer distraction is more at some time of the moon, than at other some,\r\nis it not?\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nShe is continually in a harmless distemper, sleeps little, altogether\r\nwithout appetite, save often drinking, dreaming of another world, and a\r\nbetter; and what broken piece of matter soe’er she’s about, the name\r\nPalamon lards it, that she farces every business withal, fits it to\r\nevery question.\r\n\r\nEnter Jailer’s Daughter.\r\n\r\nLook where she comes; you shall perceive her behaviour.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nI have forgot it quite. The burden on ’t was “Down-a, down-a,” and\r\npenned by no worse man than Geraldo, Emilia’s schoolmaster. He’s as\r\nfantastical, too, as ever he may go upon’s legs, for in the next world\r\nwill Dido see Palamon, and then will she be out of love with Æneas.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nWhat stuff’s here? Poor soul!\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nEven thus all day long.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nNow for this charm that I told you of: you must bring a piece of silver\r\non the tip of your tongue, or no ferry. Then if it be your chance to\r\ncome where the blessed spirits are, there’s a sight now! We maids that\r\nhave our livers perished, cracked to pieces with love, we shall come\r\nthere, and do nothing all day long but pick flowers with Proserpine.\r\nThen will I make Palamon a nosegay; then let him mark me—then.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nHow prettily she’s amiss! Note her a little further.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nFaith, I’ll tell you, sometime we go to barley-break, we of the\r\nblessed. Alas, ’tis a sore life they have i’ th’ other place—such\r\nburning, frying, boiling, hissing, howling, chattering, cursing—O, they\r\nhave shrewd measure; take heed! If one be mad, or hang or drown\r\nthemselves, thither they go; Jupiter bless us! And there shall we be\r\nput in a cauldron of lead and usurers’ grease, amongst a whole million\r\nof cutpurses, and there boil like a gammon of bacon that will never be\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nHow her brain coins!\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nLords and courtiers that have got maids with child, they are in this\r\nplace. They shall stand in fire up to the navel and in ice up to the\r\nheart, and there th’ offending part burns and the deceiving part\r\nfreezes. In troth, a very grievous punishment, as one would think, for\r\nsuch a trifle. Believe me, one would marry a leprous witch to be rid on\r\n’t, I’ll assure you.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nHow she continues this fancy! ’Tis not an engraffed madness, but a most\r\nthick, and profound melancholy.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nTo hear there a proud lady and a proud city wife howl together! I were\r\na beast an I’d call it good sport. One cries “O this smoke!” th’ other,\r\n“This fire!”; one cries, “O, that ever I did it behind the arras!” and\r\nthen howls; th’ other curses a suing fellow and her garden house.\r\n\r\n[_Sings._]\r\n _I will be true, my stars, my fate, &c._\r\n\r\n[_Exit Jailer’s Daughter._]\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nWhat think you of her, sir?\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nI think she has a perturbed mind, which I cannot minister to.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nAlas, what then?\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nUnderstand you she ever affected any man ere she beheld Palamon?\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nI was once, sir, in great hope she had fixed her liking on this\r\ngentleman, my friend.\r\n\r\nWOOER.\r\nI did think so too, and would account I had a great penn’orth on’t, to\r\ngive half my state, that both she and I at this present stood\r\nunfeignedly on the same terms.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nThat intemperate surfeit of her eye hath distempered the other senses.\r\nThey may return and settle again to execute their preordained\r\nfaculties, but they are now in a most extravagant vagary. This you must\r\ndo: confine her to a place where the light may rather seem to steal in\r\nthan be permitted. Take upon you, young sir, her friend, the name of\r\nPalamon; say you come to eat with her, and to commune of love. This\r\nwill catch her attention, for this her mind beats upon; other objects\r\nthat are inserted ’tween her mind and eye become the pranks and\r\nfriskins of her madness. Sing to her such green songs of love as she\r\nsays Palamon hath sung in prison. Come to her stuck in as sweet flowers\r\nas the season is mistress of, and thereto make an addition of some\r\nother compounded odours which are grateful to the sense. All this shall\r\nbecome Palamon, for Palamon can sing, and Palamon is sweet and every\r\ngood thing. Desire to eat with her, carve her, drink to her, and still\r\namong intermingle your petition of grace and acceptance into her\r\nfavour. Learn what maids have been her companions and play-feres, and\r\nlet them repair to her with Palamon in their mouths, and appear with\r\ntokens, as if they suggested for him. It is a falsehood she is in,\r\nwhich is with falsehoods to be combated. This may bring her to eat, to\r\nsleep, and reduce what’s now out of square in her into their former law\r\nand regiment. I have seen it approved, how many times I know not, but\r\nto make the number more I have great hope in this. I will, between the\r\npassages of this project, come in with my appliance. Let us put it in\r\nexecution and hasten the success, which, doubt not, will bring forth\r\ncomfort.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\nACT V\r\n\r\nSCENE I. Athens.

Think you but thus,\r\nThat were there aught in me which strove to show\r\nMine enemy in this business, were ’t one eye\r\nAgainst another, arm oppressed by arm,\r\nI would destroy th’ offender, coz, I would\r\nThough parcel of myself. Then from this gather\r\nHow I should tender you.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nI am in labour\r\nTo push your name, your ancient love, our kindred\r\nOut of my memory, and i’ th’ selfsame place\r\nTo seat something I would confound. So hoist we\r\nThe sails that must these vessels port even where\r\nThe heavenly limiter pleases.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nYou speak well.\r\nBefore I turn, let me embrace thee, cousin.\r\nThis I shall never do again.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nOne farewell.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nWhy, let it be so. Farewell, coz.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nFarewell, sir.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Palamon and his Knights._]\r\n\r\nKnights, kinsmen, lovers, yea, my sacrifices,\r\nTrue worshippers of Mars, whose spirit in you\r\nExpels the seeds of fear and th’ apprehension\r\nWhich still is father of it, go with me\r\nBefore the god of our profession. There\r\nRequire of him the hearts of lions and\r\nThe breath of tigers, yea, the fierceness too,\r\nYea, the speed also—to go on, I mean;\r\nElse wish we to be snails. You know my prize\r\nMust be dragged out of blood; force and great feat\r\nMust put my garland on, where she sticks,\r\nThe queen of flowers. Our intercession, then,\r\nMust be to him that makes the camp a cistern\r\nBrimmed with the blood of men. Give me your aid,\r\nAnd bend your spirits towards him.\r\n\r\n[_They advance to the altar of Mars, fall on their faces before it, and\r\nthen kneel._]\r\n\r\nThou mighty one, that with thy power hast turned\r\nGreen Neptune into purple; whose approach\r\nComets prewarn, whose havoc in vast field\r\nUnearthed skulls proclaim; whose breath blows down\r\nThe teeming Ceres’ foison, who dost pluck\r\nWith hand armipotent from forth blue clouds\r\nThe masoned turrets, that both mak’st and break’st\r\nThe stony girths of cities; me thy pupil,\r\nYoungest follower of thy drum, instruct this day\r\nWith military skill, that to thy laud\r\nI may advance my streamer, and by thee\r\nBe styled the lord o’ th’ day. Give me, great Mars,\r\nSome token of thy pleasure.\r\n\r\n[_Here they fall on their faces as formerly, and there is heard\r\nclanging of armour, with a short thunder, as the burst of a battle,\r\nwhereupon they all rise and bow to the altar._]\r\n\r\nO, great corrector of enormous times,\r\nShaker of o’er-rank states, thou grand decider\r\nOf dusty and old titles, that heal’st with blood\r\nThe earth when it is sick, and cur’st the world\r\nO’ th’ pleurisy of people; I do take\r\nThy signs auspiciously, and in thy name\r\nTo my design march boldly.—Let us go.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nEnter Palamon and his Knights, with the former observance.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nOur stars must glister with new fire, or be\r\nToday extinct. Our argument is love,\r\nWhich, if the goddess of it grant, she gives\r\nVictory too. Then blend your spirits with mine,\r\nYou whose free nobleness do make my cause\r\nYour personal hazard. To the goddess Venus\r\nCommend we our proceeding, and implore\r\nHer power unto our party.\r\n\r\n[_Here they kneel as formerly._]\r\n\r\nHail, sovereign queen of secrets, who hast power\r\nTo call the fiercest tyrant from his rage\r\nAnd weep unto a girl; that hast the might\r\nEven with an eye-glance to choke Mars’s drum\r\nAnd turn th’ alarm to whispers; that canst make\r\nA cripple flourish with his crutch, and cure him\r\nBefore Apollo; that mayst force the king\r\nTo be his subject’s vassal, and induce\r\nStale gravity to dance. The polled bachelor,\r\nWhose youth, like wanton boys through bonfires,\r\nHave skipped thy flame, at seventy thou canst catch,\r\nAnd make him, to the scorn of his hoarse throat,\r\nAbuse young lays of love. What godlike power\r\nHast thou not power upon? To Phœbus thou\r\nAdd’st flames hotter than his; the heavenly fires\r\nDid scorch his mortal son, thine him. The huntress,\r\nAll moist and cold, some say, began to throw\r\nHer bow away and sigh. Take to thy grace\r\nMe, thy vowed soldier, who do bear thy yoke\r\nAs ’twere a wreath of roses, yet is heavier\r\nThan lead itself, stings more than nettles.\r\nI have never been foul-mouthed against thy law,\r\nNe’er revealed secret, for I knew none—would not,\r\nHad I kenned all that were. I never practised\r\nUpon man’s wife, nor would the libels read\r\nOf liberal wits. I never at great feasts\r\nSought to betray a beauty, but have blushed\r\nAt simpering sirs that did. I have been harsh\r\nTo large confessors, and have hotly asked them\r\nIf they had mothers—I had one, a woman,\r\nAnd women ’twere they wronged. I knew a man\r\nOf eighty winters, this I told them, who\r\nA lass of fourteen brided; ’twas thy power\r\nTo put life into dust. The aged cramp\r\nHad screwed his square foot round;\r\nThe gout had knit his fingers into knots,\r\nTorturing convulsions from his globy eyes\r\nHad almost drawn their spheres, that what was life\r\nIn him seemed torture. This anatomy\r\nHad by his young fair fere a boy, and I\r\nBelieved it was his, for she swore it was,\r\nAnd who would not believe her? Brief, I am\r\nTo those that prate and have done, no companion;\r\nTo those that boast and have not, a defier;\r\nTo those that would and cannot, a rejoicer.\r\nYea, him I do not love that tells close offices\r\nThe foulest way, nor names concealments in\r\nThe boldest language. Such a one I am,\r\nAnd vow that lover never yet made sigh\r\nTruer than I. O, then, most soft sweet goddess,\r\nGive me the victory of this question, which\r\nIs true love’s merit, and bless me with a sign\r\nOf thy great pleasure.\r\n\r\n[_Here music is heard; doves are seen to flutter. They fall again upon\r\ntheir faces, then on their knees._]\r\n\r\nO thou that from eleven to ninety reign’st\r\nIn mortal bosoms, whose chase is this world\r\nAnd we in herds thy game, I give thee thanks\r\nFor this fair token, which being laid unto\r\nMine innocent true heart, arms in assurance\r\nMy body to this business.—Let us rise\r\nAnd bow before the goddess.\r\n\r\n[_They rise and bow._]\r\n\r\nTime comes on.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nStill music of recorders. Enter Emilia in white, her hair about her\r\nshoulders, wearing a wheaten wreath. One in white holding up her train,\r\nher hair stuck with flowers. One before her carrying a silver hind, in\r\nwhich is conveyed incense and sweet odours, which being set upon the\r\naltar of Diana, her maids standing aloof, she sets fire to it; then\r\nthey curtsy and kneel.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nO sacred, shadowy, cold, and constant queen,\r\nAbandoner of revels, mute contemplative,\r\nSweet, solitary, white as chaste, and pure\r\nAs wind-fanned snow, who to thy female knights\r\nAllow’st no more blood than will make a blush,\r\nWhich is their order’s robe, I here, thy priest,\r\nAm humbled ’fore thine altar. O, vouchsafe\r\nWith that thy rare green eye, which never yet\r\nBeheld thing maculate, look on thy virgin;\r\nAnd, sacred silver mistress, lend thine ear,\r\nWhich ne’er heard scurrile term, into whose port\r\nNe’er entered wanton sound, to my petition,\r\nSeasoned with holy fear. This is my last\r\nOf vestal office. I am bride-habited\r\nBut maiden-hearted. A husband I have ’pointed,\r\nBut do not know him. Out of two I should\r\nChoose one, and pray for his success, but I\r\nAm guiltless of election. Of mine eyes,\r\nWere I to lose one, they are equal precious;\r\nI could doom neither; that which perished should\r\nGo to ’t unsentenced. Therefore, most modest queen,\r\nHe of the two pretenders that best loves me\r\nAnd has the truest title in ’t, let him\r\nTake off my wheaten garland, or else grant\r\nThe file and quality I hold I may\r\nContinue in thy band.\r\n\r\n[_Here the hind vanishes under the altar, and in the place ascends a\r\nrose tree, having one rose upon it._]\r\n\r\n See what our general of ebbs and flows\r\nOut from the bowels of her holy altar\r\nWith sacred act advances: but one rose!\r\nIf well inspired, this battle shall confound\r\nBoth these brave knights, and I, a virgin flower,\r\nMust grow alone, unplucked.\r\n\r\n[_Here is heard a sudden twang of instruments, and the rose falls from\r\nthe tree._]\r\n\r\nThe flower is fall’n, the tree descends. O mistress,\r\nThou here dischargest me. I shall be gathered;\r\nI think so, but I know not thine own will.\r\nUnclasp thy mystery!—I hope she’s pleased;\r\nHer signs were gracious.\r\n\r\n[_They curtsy and exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. Athens. A Room in the Prison\r\n\r\nEnter Doctor, Jailer and Wooer in the habit of Palamon.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nHas this advice I told you, done any good upon her?\r\n\r\nWOOER.\r\nO, very much. The maids that kept her company\r\nHave half persuaded her that I am Palamon;\r\nWithin this half-hour she came smiling to me,\r\nAnd asked me what I would eat, and when I would kiss her.\r\nI told her “Presently,” and kissed her twice.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\n’Twas well done. Twenty times had been far better,\r\nFor there the cure lies mainly.\r\n\r\nWOOER.\r\nThen she told me\r\nShe would watch with me tonight, for well she knew\r\nWhat hour my fit would take me.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nLet her do so,\r\nAnd when your fit comes, fit her home, and presently.\r\n\r\nWOOER.\r\nShe would have me sing.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nYou did so?\r\n\r\nWOOER.\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\n’Twas very ill done, then;\r\nYou should observe her every way.\r\n\r\nWOOER.\r\nAlas,\r\nI have no voice, sir, to confirm her that way.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nThat’s all one, if ye make a noise.\r\nIf she entreat again, do anything.\r\nLie with her, if she ask you.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nHoa, there, doctor!\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nYes, in the way of cure.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nBut first, by your leave,\r\nI’ th’ way of honesty.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nThat’s but a niceness,\r\nNe’er cast your child away for honesty.\r\nCure her first this way; then if she will be honest,\r\nShe has the path before her.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nThank ye, Doctor.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nPray, bring her in,\r\nAnd let’s see how she is.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nI will, and tell her\r\nHer Palamon stays for her. But, Doctor,\r\nMethinks you are i’ th’ wrong still.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Jailer._]\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nGo, go;\r\nYou fathers are fine fools.

She comes, pray, humour her.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nCome, your love Palamon stays for you, child,\r\nAnd has done this long hour, to visit you.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nI thank him for his gentle patience;\r\nHe’s a kind gentleman, and I am much bound to him.\r\nDid you ne’er see the horse he gave me?\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nHow do you like him?\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nHe’s a very fair one.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nYou never saw him dance?\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nI have often.\r\nHe dances very finely, very comely,\r\nAnd for a jig, come cut and long tail to him,\r\nHe turns ye like a top.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nThat’s fine, indeed.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nHe’ll dance the morris twenty mile an hour,\r\nAnd that will founder the best hobby-horse\r\nIf I have any skill in all the parish,\r\nAnd gallops to the tune of “Light o’ love.”\r\nWhat think you of this horse?\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nHaving these virtues,\r\nI think he might be brought to play at tennis.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nAlas, that’s nothing.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nCan he write and read too?\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nA very fair hand, and casts himself th’ accounts\r\nOf all his hay and provender. That hostler\r\nMust rise betime that cozens him. You know\r\nThe chestnut mare the Duke has?\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nVery well.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nShe is horribly in love with him, poor beast;\r\nBut he is like his master, coy and scornful.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nWhat dowry has she?\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nSome two hundred bottles,\r\nAnd twenty strike of oates; but he’ll ne’er have her.\r\nHe lisps in’s neighing, able to entice\r\nA miller’s mare. He’ll be the death of her.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nWhat stuff she utters!\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nMake curtsy; here your love comes.\r\n\r\nEnter Wooer and Doctor come forward.\r\n\r\nWOOER.\r\nPretty soul,\r\nHow do ye?

I have nothing\r\nBut this poor petticoat, and two coarse smocks.\r\n\r\nWOOER.\r\nThat’s all one; I will have you.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nWill you surely?\r\n\r\nWOOER.\r\n[_Taking her hand._] Yes, by this fair hand, will I.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nWe’ll to bed, then.\r\n\r\nWOOER.\r\nE’en when you will.\r\n\r\n[_Kisses her._]\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\n[_Rubs off the kiss._] O sir, you would fain be nibbling.\r\n\r\nWOOER.\r\nWhy do you rub my kiss off?\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\n’Tis a sweet one,\r\nAnd will perfume me finely against the wedding.\r\nIs not this your cousin Arcite?\r\n\r\n[_She indicates the Doctor._]\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nYes, sweetheart,\r\nAnd I am glad my cousin Palamon\r\nHas made so fair a choice.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nDo you think he’ll have me?\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.\r\nYes, without doubt.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nDo you think so too?\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\nWe shall have many children.

Darkness, which ever was\r\nThe dam of horror, who does stand accursed\r\nOf many mortal millions, may even now,\r\nBy casting her black mantle over both,\r\nThat neither could find other, get herself\r\nSome part of a good name, and many a murder\r\nSet off whereto she’s guilty.\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA.\r\nYou must go.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nIn faith, I will not.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nWhy, the knights must kindle\r\nTheir valour at your eye. Know, of this war\r\nYou are the treasure, and must needs be by\r\nTo give the service pay.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nSir, pardon me;\r\nThe title of a kingdom may be tried\r\nOut of itself.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nWell, well, then, at your pleasure.\r\nThose that remain with you could wish their office\r\nTo any of their enemies.\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA.\r\nFarewell, sister.\r\nI am like to know your husband ’fore yourself\r\nBy some small start of time. He whom the gods\r\nDo of the two know best, I pray them he\r\nBe made your lot.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt all but Emilia._]\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nArcite is gently visaged, yet his eye\r\nIs like an engine bent, or a sharp weapon\r\nIn a soft sheath; mercy and manly courage\r\nAre bedfellows in his visage. Palamon\r\nHas a most menacing aspect; his brow\r\nIs graved, and seems to bury what it frowns on;\r\nYet sometimes ’tis not so, but alters to\r\nThe quality of his thoughts. Long time his eye\r\nWill dwell upon his object. Melancholy\r\nBecomes him nobly; so does Arcite’s mirth;\r\nBut Palamon’s sadness is a kind of mirth,\r\nSo mingled as if mirth did make him sad\r\nAnd sadness merry. Those darker humours that\r\nStick misbecomingly on others, on them\r\nLive in fair dwelling.\r\n\r\n[_Cornets. Trumpets sound as to a charge._]\r\n\r\nHark how yon spurs to spirit do incite\r\nThe princes to their proof! Arcite may win me\r\nAnd yet may Palamon wound Arcite to\r\nThe spoiling of his figure. O, what pity\r\nEnough for such a chance? If I were by,\r\nI might do hurt, for they would glance their eyes\r\nTowards my seat, and in that motion might\r\nOmit a ward or forfeit an offence\r\nWhich craved that very time. It is much better\r\nI am not there.\r\n\r\n[_Cornets. A great cry and noise within crying “À Palamon!”_]\r\n\r\nOh better never born\r\nThan minister to such harm.\r\n\r\nEnter Servant.\r\n\r\nWhat is the chance?\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nThe cry’s “À Palamon.”\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nThen he has won. ’Twas ever likely.\r\nHe looked all grace and success, and he is\r\nDoubtless the prim’st of men. I prithee run\r\nAnd tell me how it goes.\r\n\r\n[_Shout and cornets, crying “À Palamon!”_]\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nStill “Palamon.”\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nRun and enquire.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Servant._]\r\n\r\nPoor servant, thou hast lost.\r\nUpon my right side still I wore thy picture,\r\nPalamon’s on the left. Why so, I know not.\r\nI had no end in ’t else; chance would have it so.\r\nOn the sinister side the heart lies; Palamon\r\nHad the best-boding chance.\r\n\r\n[_Another cry and shout within, and cornets._]\r\n\r\nThis burst of clamour\r\nIs sure th’ end o’ th’ combat.\r\n\r\nEnter Servant.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nThey said that Palamon had Arcite’s body\r\nWithin an inch o’ th’ pyramid, that the cry\r\nWas general “À Palamon.” But anon,\r\nTh’ assistants made a brave redemption, and\r\nThe two bold titlers at this instant are\r\nHand to hand at it.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nWere they metamorphosed\r\nBoth into one—O, why? There were no woman\r\nWorth so composed a man! Their single share,\r\nTheir nobleness peculiar to them, gives\r\nThe prejudice of disparity, value’s shortness,\r\nTo any lady breathing.\r\n\r\n[_Cornets. Cry within, “Arcite, Arcite.”_]\r\n\r\nMore exulting?\r\n“Palamon” still?\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nNay, now the sound is “Arcite.”\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nI prithee, lay attention to the cry;\r\nSet both thine ears to th’ business.\r\n\r\n[_Cornets. A great shout and cry “Arcite, victory!”_]\r\n\nSERVANT.\r\nThe cry is\r\n“Arcite”, and “Victory!” Hark, “Arcite, victory!”\r\nThe combat’s consummation is proclaimed\r\nBy the wind instruments.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nHalf-sights saw\r\nThat Arcite was no babe. God’s lid, his richness\r\nAnd costliness of spirit looked through him; it could\r\nNo more be hid in him than fire in flax,\r\nThan humble banks can go to law with waters\r\nThat drift-winds force to raging. I did think\r\nGood Palamon would miscarry, yet I knew not\r\nWhy I did think so. Our reasons are not prophets\r\nWhen oft our fancies are. They are coming off.\r\nAlas, poor Palamon!\r\n\r\nCornets. Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Pirithous, Arcite as victor, and\r\nAttendants.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nLo, where our sister is in expectation,\r\nYet quaking and unsettled.—Fairest Emily,\r\nThe gods by their divine arbitrament\r\nHave given you this knight; he is a good one\r\nAs ever struck at head. Give me your hands.\r\nReceive you her, you him; be plighted with\r\nA love that grows as you decay.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nEmily,\r\nTo buy you, I have lost what’s dearest to me,\r\nSave what is bought; and yet I purchase cheaply,\r\nAs I do rate your value.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nO loved sister,\r\nHe speaks now of as brave a knight as e’er\r\nDid spur a noble steed. Surely the gods\r\nWould have him die a bachelor, lest his race\r\nShould show i’ th’ world too godlike. His behaviour\r\nSo charmed me that methought Alcides was\r\nTo him a sow of lead. If I could praise\r\nEach part of him to th’ all I have spoke, your Arcite\r\nDid not lose by ’t, for he that was thus good\r\nEncountered yet his better. I have heard\r\nTwo emulous Philomels beat the ear o’ th’ night\r\nWith their contentious throats, now one the higher,\r\nAnon the other, then again the first,\r\nAnd by-and-by out-breasted, that the sense\r\nCould not be judge between ’em. So it fared\r\nGood space between these kinsmen, till heavens did\r\nMake hardly one the winner.—Wear the garland\r\nWith joy that you have won.—For the subdued,\r\nGive them our present justice, since I know\r\nTheir lives but pinch ’em. Let it here be done.\r\nThe scene’s not for our seeing. Go we hence\r\nRight joyful, with some sorrow.—Arm your prize;\r\nI know you will not lose her.—Hippolyta,\r\nI see one eye of yours conceives a tear,\r\nThe which it will deliver.\r\n\r\n[_Flourish._]\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nIs this winning?\r\nO all you heavenly powers, where is your mercy?\r\nBut that your wills have said it must be so,\r\nAnd charge me live to comfort this unfriended,\r\nThis miserable prince, that cuts away\r\nA life more worthy from him than all women,\r\nI should and would die too.\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA.\r\nInfinite pity\r\nThat four such eyes should be so fixed on one\r\nThat two must needs be blind for ’t.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nSo it is.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV. The same; a Block prepared\r\n\r\nEnter Palamon and his Knights pinioned; Jailer, Executioner and Guard.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nThere’s many a man alive that hath outlived\r\nThe love o’ th’ people; yea, i’ th’ selfsame state\r\nStands many a father with his child. Some comfort\r\nWe have by so considering. We expire,\r\nAnd not without men’s pity; to live still,\r\nHave their good wishes; we prevent\r\nThe loathsome misery of age, beguile\r\nThe gout and rheum that in lag hours attend\r\nFor gray approachers; we come towards the gods\r\nYoung and unwappered, not halting under crimes\r\nMany and stale. That sure shall please the gods\r\nSooner than such, to give us nectar with ’em,\r\nFor we are more clear spirits. My dear kinsmen,\r\nWhose lives for this poor comfort are laid down,\r\nYou have sold ’em too too cheap.\r\n\r\nFIRST KNIGHT.\r\nWhat ending could be\r\nOf more content? O’er us the victors have\r\nFortune, whose title is as momentary,\r\nAs to us death is certain. A grain of honour\r\nThey not o’erweigh us.\r\n\r\nSECOND KNIGHT.\r\nLet us bid farewell;\r\nAnd with our patience anger tottering Fortune,\r\nWho at her certain’st reels.\r\n\r\nTHIRD KNIGHT.\r\nCome; who begins?\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nE’en he that led you to this banquet shall\r\nTaste to you all.—Ah ha, my friend, my friend,\r\nYour gentle daughter gave me freedom once;\r\nYou’ll see ’t done now for ever. Pray, how does she?\r\nI heard she was not well; her kind of ill\r\nGave me some sorrow.\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nSir, she’s well restored,\r\nAnd to be married shortly.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nBy my short life,\r\nI am most glad on’t. ’Tis the latest thing\r\nI shall be glad of; prithee, tell her so.\r\nCommend me to her, and, to piece her portion,\r\nTender her this.\r\n\r\n[_Gives him his purse._]\r\n\r\nFIRST KNIGHT.\r\nNay let’s be offerers all.\r\n\r\nSECOND KNIGHT.\r\nIs it a maid?\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nVerily, I think so.\r\nA right good creature, more to me deserving\r\nThen I can ’quite or speak of.\r\n\r\nALL KNIGHTS.\r\nCommend us to her.\r\n\r\n[_They give their purses._]\r\n\r\nJAILER.\r\nThe gods requite you all, and make her thankful.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nAdieu; and let my life be now as short\r\nAs my leave-taking.\r\n\r\n[_Lays his head on the block._]\r\n\r\nFIRST KNIGHT.\r\nLead, courageous cousin.\r\n\r\nSECOND AND THIRD KNIGHT.\r\nWe’ll follow cheerfully.\r\n\r\n[_A great noise within crying “Run!” “Save!” “Hold!”_]\r\n\r\nEnter in haste a Messenger.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nHold, hold! O hold, hold, hold!\r\n\r\nEnter Pirithous in haste.\r\n\r\nPIRITHOUS.\r\nHold, ho! It is a cursed haste you made\r\nIf you have done so quickly!—Noble Palamon,\r\nThe gods will show their glory in a life\r\nThat thou art yet to lead.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nCan that be,\r\nWhen Venus, I have said, is false? How do things fare?\r\n\r\nPIRITHOUS.\r\nArise, great sir, and give the tidings ear\r\nThat are most dearly sweet and bitter.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nWhat\r\nHath waked us from our dream?\r\n\r\nPIRITHOUS.\r\nList, then. Your cousin,\r\nMounted upon a steed that Emily\r\nDid first bestow on him, a black one, owing\r\nNot a hair-worth of white, which some will say\r\nWeakens his price, and many will not buy\r\nHis goodness with this note, which superstition\r\nHere finds allowance—on this horse is Arcite\r\nTrotting the stones of Athens, which the calkins\r\nDid rather tell than trample; for the horse\r\nWould make his length a mile, if ’t pleased his rider\r\nTo put pride in him. As he thus went counting\r\nThe flinty pavement, dancing, as ’twere, to th’ music\r\nHis own hooves made—for, as they say, from iron\r\nCame music’s origin—what envious flint,\r\nCold as old Saturn, and like him possessed\r\nWith fire malevolent, darted a spark,\r\nOr what fierce sulphur else, to this end made,\r\nI comment not; the hot horse, hot as fire,\r\nTook toy at this and fell to what disorder\r\nHis power could give his will; bounds, comes on end,\r\nForgets school-doing, being therein trained\r\nAnd of kind manage. Pig-like he whines\r\nAt the sharp rowel, which he frets at rather\r\nThan any jot obeys; seeks all foul means\r\nOf boist’rous and rough jad’ry to disseat\r\nHis lord that kept it bravely. When naught served,\r\nWhen neither curb would crack, girth break, nor diff’ring plunges\r\nDisroot his rider whence he grew, but that\r\nHe kept him ’tween his legs, on his hind hoofs\r\nOn end he stands\r\nThat Arcite’s legs, being higher than his head,\r\nSeemed with strange art to hang. His victor’s wreath\r\nEven then fell off his head and presently\r\nBackward the jade comes o’er, and his full poise\r\nBecomes the rider’s load. Yet is he living,\r\nBut such a vessel ’tis that floats but for\r\nThe surge that next approaches. He much desires\r\nTo have some speech with you. Lo, he appears.\r\n\r\nEnter Theseus, Hippolyta, Emilia, Arcite in a chair.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nO miserable end of our alliance!\r\nThe gods are mighty. Arcite, if thy heart,\r\nThy worthy, manly heart, be yet unbroken,\r\nGive me thy last words. I am Palamon,\r\nOne that yet loves thee dying.\r\n\r\nARCITE.\r\nTake Emilia\r\nAnd with her all the world’s joy. Reach thy hand;\r\nFarewell. I have told my last hour. I was false,\r\nYet never treacherous. Forgive me, cousin.\r\nOne kiss from fair Emilia.\r\n\r\n[_Emilia kisses Arcite._]\r\n\r\n’Tis done.\r\nTake her. I die.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nThy brave soul seek Elysium!\r\n\r\n[_Arcite dies._]\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nI’ll close thine eyes, Prince; blessed souls be with thee!\r\nThou art a right good man, and, while I live,\r\nThis day I give to tears.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nAnd I to honour.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nIn this place first you fought; e’en very here\r\nI sundered you. Acknowledge to the gods\r\nOur thanks that you are living.\r\nHis part is played, and, though it were too short,\r\nHe did it well; your day is lengthened, and\r\nThe blissful dew of heaven does arrose you.\r\nThe powerful Venus well hath graced her altar,\r\nAnd given you your love. Our master Mars,\r\nHath vouched his oracle, and to Arcite gave\r\nThe grace of the contention. So the deities\r\nHave showed due justice.—Bear this hence.\r\n\r\nPALAMON.\r\nO cousin,\r\nThat we should things desire, which do cost us\r\nThe loss of our desire! That naught could buy\r\nDear love, but loss of dear love!\r\n\r\n[_Arcite’s body is carried out._]\r\n\r\nTHESEUS.\r\nNever Fortune\r\nDid play a subtler game. The conquered triumphs;\r\nThe victor has the loss; yet in the passage\r\nThe gods have been most equal. Palamon,\r\nYour kinsman hath confessed the right o’ th’ lady\r\nDid lie in you, for you first saw her and\r\nEven then proclaimed your fancy. He restored her\r\nAs your stol’n jewel and desired your spirit\r\nTo send him hence forgiven. The gods my justice\r\nTake from my hand and they themselves become\r\nThe executioners. Lead your lady off\r\nAnd call your lovers from the stage of death,\r\nWhom I adopt my friends. A day or two\r\nLet us look sadly, and give grace unto\r\nThe funeral of Arcite, in whose end\r\nThe visages of bridegrooms we’ll put on\r\nAnd smile with Palamon; for whom an hour,\r\nBut one hour since, I was as dearly sorry\r\nAs glad of Arcite, and am now as glad\r\nAs for him sorry. O you heavenly charmers,\r\nWhat things you make of us! For what we lack\r\nWe laugh, for what we have are sorry, still\r\nAre children in some kind. Let us be thankful\r\nFor that which is, and with you leave dispute\r\nThat are above our question. Let’s go off\r\nAnd bear us like the time.\r\n\r\n[_Flourish. Exeunt._]\r\n\nEPILOGUE\r\n\nEnter Epilogue.\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE\r\n I would now ask ye how you like the play,\r\nBut, as it is with schoolboys, cannot say.\r\nI am cruel fearful! Pray yet, stay a while,\r\nAnd let me look upon ye. No man smile?\r\nThen it goes hard, I see. He that has\r\nLoved a young handsome wench, then, show his face—\r\n’Tis strange if none be here—and, if he will,\r\nAgainst his conscience let him hiss, and kill\r\nOur market. ’Tis in vain, I see, to stay ye.\r\nHave at the worst can come, then! Now what say ye?\r\nAnd yet mistake me not: I am not bold;\r\nWe have no such cause. If the tale we have told\r\nFor ’tis no other—any way content ye—\r\nFor to that honest purpose it was meant ye—\r\nWe have our end; and you shall have ere long,\r\nI dare say, many a better, to prolong\r\nYour old loves to us. We, and all our might,\r\nRest at your service. Gentlemen, good night.\r\n\r\n[_Flourish. Exit._]\r\n\r\nFINIS\r\n\nTHE WINTER’S TALE\r\n\nContents\r\n\r\nACT I\r\nScene I. Sicilia.

Sicilia. An Antechamber in Leontes’ Palace.\r\n\r\n Enter Camillo and Archidamus.\r\n\r\nARCHIDAMUS.\r\nIf you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on the like occasion\r\nwhereon my services are now on foot, you shall see, as I have said,\r\ngreat difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nI think this coming summer the King of Sicilia means to pay Bohemia the\r\nvisitation which he justly owes him.\r\n\r\nARCHIDAMUS.\r\nWherein our entertainment shall shame us; we will be justified in our\r\nloves. For indeed,—\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nBeseech you—\r\n\r\nARCHIDAMUS.\r\nVerily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge. We cannot with such\r\nmagnificence—in so rare—I know not what to say. We will give you sleepy\r\ndrinks, that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience, may,\r\nthough they cannot praise us, as little accuse us.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nYou pay a great deal too dear for what’s given freely.\r\n\r\nARCHIDAMUS.\r\nBelieve me, I speak as my understanding instructs me and as mine\r\nhonesty puts it to utterance.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nSicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia. They were trained\r\ntogether in their childhoods, and there rooted betwixt them then such\r\nan affection which cannot choose but branch now. Since their more\r\nmature dignities and royal necessities made separation of their\r\nsociety, their encounters, though not personal, have been royally\r\nattorneyed with interchange of gifts, letters, loving embassies, that\r\nthey have seemed to be together, though absent; shook hands, as over a\r\nvast; and embraced as it were from the ends of opposed winds. The\r\nheavens continue their loves!\r\n\r\nARCHIDAMUS.\r\nI think there is not in the world either malice or matter to alter it.\r\nYou have an unspeakable comfort of your young Prince Mamillius. It is a\r\ngentleman of the greatest promise that ever came into my note.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nI very well agree with you in the hopes of him. It is a gallant child;\r\none that indeed physics the subject, makes old hearts fresh. They that\r\nwent on crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to see him a\r\nman.\r\n\r\nARCHIDAMUS.\r\nWould they else be content to die?\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nYes, if there were no other excuse why they should desire to live.\r\n\r\nARCHIDAMUS.\r\nIf the king had no son, they would desire to live on crutches till he\r\nhad one.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II.

Time as long again\r\nWould be fill’d up, my brother, with our thanks;\r\nAnd yet we should, for perpetuity,\r\nGo hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,\r\nYet standing in rich place, I multiply\r\nWith one “we thank you” many thousands more\r\nThat go before it.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nStay your thanks a while,\r\nAnd pay them when you part.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nSir, that’s tomorrow.\r\nI am question’d by my fears, of what may chance\r\nOr breed upon our absence; that may blow\r\nNo sneaping winds at home, to make us say\r\n“This is put forth too truly.” Besides, I have stay’d\r\nTo tire your royalty.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nWe are tougher, brother,\r\nThan you can put us to ’t.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nNo longer stay.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nOne seve’night longer.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nVery sooth, tomorrow.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nWe’ll part the time between ’s then: and in that\r\nI’ll no gainsaying.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nPress me not, beseech you, so,\r\nThere is no tongue that moves, none, none i’ th’ world,\r\nSo soon as yours, could win me: so it should now,\r\nWere there necessity in your request, although\r\n’Twere needful I denied it. My affairs\r\nDo even drag me homeward: which to hinder\r\nWere, in your love a whip to me; my stay\r\nTo you a charge and trouble: to save both,\r\nFarewell, our brother.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nTongue-tied, our queen? Speak you.\r\n\r\nHERMIONE.\r\nI had thought, sir, to have held my peace until\r\nYou had drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,\r\nCharge him too coldly. Tell him you are sure\r\nAll in Bohemia’s well: this satisfaction\r\nThe by-gone day proclaimed. Say this to him,\r\nHe’s beat from his best ward.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nWell said, Hermione.\r\n\r\nHERMIONE.\r\nTo tell he longs to see his son were strong.\r\nBut let him say so then, and let him go;\r\nBut let him swear so, and he shall not stay,\r\nWe’ll thwack him hence with distaffs.\r\n[_To Polixenes._] Yet of your royal presence I’ll adventure\r\nThe borrow of a week. When at Bohemia\r\nYou take my lord, I’ll give him my commission\r\nTo let him there a month behind the gest\r\nPrefix’d for’s parting:—yet, good deed, Leontes,\r\nI love thee not a jar of th’ clock behind\r\nWhat lady she her lord. You’ll stay?\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nNo, madam.\r\n\r\nHERMIONE.\r\nNay, but you will?\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nI may not, verily.\r\n\r\nHERMIONE.\r\nVerily!\r\nYou put me off with limber vows; but I,\r\nThough you would seek t’ unsphere the stars with oaths,\r\nShould yet say “Sir, no going.” Verily,\r\nYou shall not go. A lady’s verily is\r\nAs potent as a lord’s. Will go yet?\r\nForce me to keep you as a prisoner,\r\nNot like a guest: so you shall pay your fees\r\nWhen you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?\r\nMy prisoner or my guest? By your dread “verily,”\r\nOne of them you shall be.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nYour guest, then, madam.\r\nTo be your prisoner should import offending;\r\nWhich is for me less easy to commit\r\nThan you to punish.\r\n\r\nHERMIONE.\r\nNot your gaoler then,\r\nBut your kind hostess. Come, I’ll question you\r\nOf my lord’s tricks and yours when you were boys.\r\nYou were pretty lordings then.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nWe were, fair queen,\r\nTwo lads that thought there was no more behind\r\nBut such a day tomorrow as today,\r\nAnd to be boy eternal.\r\n\r\nHERMIONE.\r\nWas not my lord\r\nThe verier wag o’ th’ two?\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nWe were as twinn’d lambs that did frisk i’ th’ sun\r\nAnd bleat the one at th’ other. What we chang’d\r\nWas innocence for innocence; we knew not\r\nThe doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream’d\r\nThat any did. Had we pursu’d that life,\r\nAnd our weak spirits ne’er been higher rear’d\r\nWith stronger blood, we should have answer’d heaven\r\nBoldly “Not guilty,” the imposition clear’d\r\nHereditary ours.\r\n\r\nHERMIONE.\r\nBy this we gather\r\nYou have tripp’d since.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nO my most sacred lady,\r\nTemptations have since then been born to ’s! for\r\nIn those unfledg’d days was my wife a girl;\r\nYour precious self had then not cross’d the eyes\r\nOf my young play-fellow.\r\n\r\nHERMIONE.\r\nGrace to boot!\r\nOf this make no conclusion, lest you say\r\nYour queen and I are devils. Yet go on;\r\nTh’ offences we have made you do we’ll answer,\r\nIf you first sinn’d with us, and that with us\r\nYou did continue fault, and that you slipp’d not\r\nWith any but with us.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nIs he won yet?\r\n\r\nHERMIONE.\r\nHe’ll stay, my lord.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nAt my request he would not.\r\nHermione, my dearest, thou never spok’st\r\nTo better purpose.\r\n\r\nHERMIONE.\r\nNever?\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nNever but once.\r\n\r\nHERMIONE.\r\nWhat! have I twice said well? when was’t before?\r\nI prithee tell me. Cram ’s with praise, and make ’s\r\nAs fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless\r\nSlaughters a thousand waiting upon that.\r\nOur praises are our wages. You may ride ’s\r\nWith one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere\r\nWith spur we heat an acre. But to th’ goal:\r\nMy last good deed was to entreat his stay.\r\nWhat was my first? It has an elder sister,\r\nOr I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!\r\nBut once before I spoke to the purpose—when?\r\nNay, let me have’t; I long.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nWhy, that was when\r\nThree crabbed months had sour’d themselves to death,\r\nEre I could make thee open thy white hand\r\nAnd clap thyself my love; then didst thou utter\r\n“I am yours for ever.”\r\n\r\nHERMIONE.\r\n’Tis Grace indeed.\r\nWhy, lo you now, I have spoke to th’ purpose twice.\r\nThe one for ever earn’d a royal husband;\r\nTh’ other for some while a friend.\r\n\r\n [_Giving her hand to Polixenes._]\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\n[_Aside._] Too hot, too hot!\r\nTo mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.\r\nI have _tremor cordis_ on me. My heart dances,\r\nBut not for joy,—not joy. This entertainment\r\nMay a free face put on, derive a liberty\r\nFrom heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,\r\nAnd well become the agent: ’t may, I grant:\r\nBut to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,\r\nAs now they are, and making practis’d smiles\r\nAs in a looking-glass; and then to sigh, as ’twere\r\nThe mort o’ th’ deer. O, that is entertainment\r\nMy bosom likes not, nor my brows. Mamillius,\r\nArt thou my boy?\r\n\r\nMAMILLIUS.\r\nAy, my good lord.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nI’ fecks!\r\nWhy, that’s my bawcock. What! hast smutch’d thy nose?\r\nThey say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,\r\nWe must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:\r\nAnd yet the steer, the heifer, and the calf\r\nAre all call’d neat.—Still virginalling\r\nUpon his palm?—How now, you wanton calf!\r\nArt thou my calf?\r\n\r\nMAMILLIUS.\r\nYes, if you will, my lord.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nThou want’st a rough pash and the shoots that I have\r\nTo be full like me:—yet they say we are\r\nAlmost as like as eggs; women say so,\r\nThat will say anything. But were they false\r\nAs o’er-dy’d blacks, as wind, as waters, false\r\nAs dice are to be wish’d by one that fixes\r\nNo bourn ’twixt his and mine, yet were it true\r\nTo say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,\r\nLook on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!\r\nMost dear’st! my collop! Can thy dam?—may’t be?\r\nAffection! thy intention stabs the centre:\r\nThou dost make possible things not so held,\r\nCommunicat’st with dreams;—how can this be?—\r\nWith what’s unreal thou coactive art,\r\nAnd fellow’st nothing: then ’tis very credent\r\nThou may’st co-join with something; and thou dost,\r\nAnd that beyond commission, and I find it,\r\nAnd that to the infection of my brains\r\nAnd hardening of my brows.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nWhat means Sicilia?\r\n\r\nHERMIONE.\r\nHe something seems unsettled.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nHow, my lord?\r\nWhat cheer? How is’t with you, best brother?\r\n\r\nHERMIONE.\r\nYou look\r\nAs if you held a brow of much distraction:\r\nAre you mov’d, my lord?\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nNo, in good earnest.\r\nHow sometimes nature will betray its folly,\r\nIts tenderness, and make itself a pastime\r\nTo harder bosoms! Looking on the lines\r\nOf my boy’s face, methoughts I did recoil\r\nTwenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech’d,\r\nIn my green velvet coat; my dagger muzzled\r\nLest it should bite its master, and so prove,\r\nAs ornaments oft do, too dangerous.\r\nHow like, methought, I then was to this kernel,\r\nThis squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,\r\nWill you take eggs for money?\r\n\r\nMAMILLIUS.\r\nNo, my lord, I’ll fight.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nYou will? Why, happy man be ’s dole! My brother,\r\nAre you so fond of your young prince as we\r\nDo seem to be of ours?\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nIf at home, sir,\r\nHe’s all my exercise, my mirth, my matter:\r\nNow my sworn friend, and then mine enemy;\r\nMy parasite, my soldier, statesman, all.\r\nHe makes a July’s day short as December;\r\nAnd with his varying childness cures in me\r\nThoughts that would thick my blood.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nSo stands this squire\r\nOffic’d with me. We two will walk, my lord,\r\nAnd leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,\r\nHow thou lov’st us show in our brother’s welcome;\r\nLet what is dear in Sicily be cheap:\r\nNext to thyself and my young rover, he’s\r\nApparent to my heart.\r\n\r\nHERMIONE.\r\nIf you would seek us,\r\nWe are yours i’ the garden. Shall ’s attend you there?\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nTo your own bents dispose you: you’ll be found,\r\nBe you beneath the sky. [_Aside._] I am angling now,\r\nThough you perceive me not how I give line.\r\nGo to, go to!\r\nHow she holds up the neb, the bill to him!\r\nAnd arms her with the boldness of a wife\r\nTo her allowing husband!\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Polixenes, Hermione and Attendants._]\r\n\r\nGone already!\r\nInch-thick, knee-deep, o’er head and ears a fork’d one!—\r\nGo, play, boy, play. Thy mother plays, and I\r\nPlay too; but so disgrac’d a part, whose issue\r\nWill hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour\r\nWill be my knell. Go, play, boy, play. There have been,\r\nOr I am much deceiv’d, cuckolds ere now;\r\nAnd many a man there is, even at this present,\r\nNow while I speak this, holds his wife by th’ arm,\r\nThat little thinks she has been sluic’d in ’s absence,\r\nAnd his pond fish’d by his next neighbour, by\r\nSir Smile, his neighbour. Nay, there’s comfort in ’t,\r\nWhiles other men have gates, and those gates open’d,\r\nAs mine, against their will. Should all despair\r\nThat hath revolted wives, the tenth of mankind\r\nWould hang themselves. Physic for’t there’s none;\r\nIt is a bawdy planet, that will strike\r\nWhere ’tis predominant; and ’tis powerful, think it,\r\nFrom east, west, north, and south. Be it concluded,\r\nNo barricado for a belly. Know’t;\r\nIt will let in and out the enemy\r\nWith bag and baggage. Many thousand of us\r\nHave the disease, and feel’t not.—How now, boy!\r\n\r\nMAMILLIUS.\r\nI am like you, they say.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nWhy, that’s some comfort.\r\nWhat! Camillo there?\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nAy, my good lord.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nGo play, Mamillius; thou’rt an honest man.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Mamillius._]\r\n\r\nCamillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nYou had much ado to make his anchor hold:\r\nWhen you cast out, it still came home.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nDidst note it?\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nHe would not stay at your petitions; made\r\nHis business more material.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nDidst perceive it?\r\n[_Aside._] They’re here with me already; whisp’ring, rounding,\r\n“Sicilia is a so-forth.” ’Tis far gone\r\nWhen I shall gust it last.—How came’t, Camillo,\r\nThat he did stay?\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nAt the good queen’s entreaty.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nAt the queen’s be’t: “good” should be pertinent,\r\nBut so it is, it is not. Was this taken\r\nBy any understanding pate but thine?\r\nFor thy conceit is soaking, will draw in\r\nMore than the common blocks. Not noted, is’t,\r\nBut of the finer natures? by some severals\r\nOf head-piece extraordinary? lower messes\r\nPerchance are to this business purblind? say.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nBusiness, my lord? I think most understand\r\nBohemia stays here longer.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nHa?\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nStays here longer.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nAy, but why?\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nTo satisfy your highness, and the entreaties\r\nOf our most gracious mistress.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nSatisfy?\r\nTh’ entreaties of your mistress? Satisfy?\r\nLet that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,\r\nWith all the nearest things to my heart, as well\r\nMy chamber-counsels, wherein, priest-like, thou\r\nHast cleans’d my bosom; I from thee departed\r\nThy penitent reform’d. But we have been\r\nDeceiv’d in thy integrity, deceiv’d\r\nIn that which seems so.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nBe it forbid, my lord!\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nTo bide upon’t: thou art not honest; or,\r\nIf thou inclin’st that way, thou art a coward,\r\nWhich hoxes honesty behind, restraining\r\nFrom course requir’d; or else thou must be counted\r\nA servant grafted in my serious trust,\r\nAnd therein negligent; or else a fool\r\nThat seest a game play’d home, the rich stake drawn,\r\nAnd tak’st it all for jest.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nMy gracious lord,\r\nI may be negligent, foolish, and fearful;\r\nIn every one of these no man is free,\r\nBut that his negligence, his folly, fear,\r\nAmong the infinite doings of the world,\r\nSometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,\r\nIf ever I were wilful-negligent,\r\nIt was my folly; if industriously\r\nI play’d the fool, it was my negligence,\r\nNot weighing well the end; if ever fearful\r\nTo do a thing, where I the issue doubted,\r\nWhereof the execution did cry out\r\nAgainst the non-performance, ’twas a fear\r\nWhich oft affects the wisest: these, my lord,\r\nAre such allow’d infirmities that honesty\r\nIs never free of. But, beseech your Grace,\r\nBe plainer with me; let me know my trespass\r\nBy its own visage: if I then deny it,\r\n’Tis none of mine.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nHa’ not you seen, Camillo?\r\n(But that’s past doubt: you have, or your eye-glass\r\nIs thicker than a cuckold’s horn) or heard?\r\n(For, to a vision so apparent, rumour\r\nCannot be mute) or thought? (for cogitation\r\nResides not in that man that does not think)\r\nMy wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,\r\nOr else be impudently negative,\r\nTo have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say\r\nMy wife’s a hobby-horse, deserves a name\r\nAs rank as any flax-wench that puts to\r\nBefore her troth-plight: say’t and justify’t.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nI would not be a stander-by to hear\r\nMy sovereign mistress clouded so, without\r\nMy present vengeance taken: ’shrew my heart,\r\nYou never spoke what did become you less\r\nThan this; which to reiterate were sin\r\nAs deep as that, though true.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nIs whispering nothing?\r\nIs leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?\r\nKissing with inside lip? Stopping the career\r\nOf laughter with a sigh?—a note infallible\r\nOf breaking honesty?—horsing foot on foot?\r\nSkulking in corners? Wishing clocks more swift?\r\nHours, minutes? Noon, midnight? and all eyes\r\nBlind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,\r\nThat would unseen be wicked? Is this nothing?\r\nWhy, then the world and all that’s in’t is nothing,\r\nThe covering sky is nothing, Bohemia nothing,\r\nMy wife is nothing, nor nothing have these nothings,\r\nIf this be nothing.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nGood my lord, be cur’d\r\nOf this diseas’d opinion, and betimes,\r\nFor ’tis most dangerous.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nSay it be, ’tis true.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nNo, no, my lord.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nIt is; you lie, you lie:\r\nI say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,\r\nPronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,\r\nOr else a hovering temporizer that\r\nCanst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,\r\nInclining to them both. Were my wife’s liver\r\nInfected as her life, she would not live\r\nThe running of one glass.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nWho does infect her?\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nWhy, he that wears her like her medal, hanging\r\nAbout his neck, Bohemia: who, if I\r\nHad servants true about me, that bare eyes\r\nTo see alike mine honour as their profits,\r\nTheir own particular thrifts, they would do that\r\nWhich should undo more doing: ay, and thou,\r\nHis cupbearer,—whom I from meaner form\r\nHave bench’d and rear’d to worship, who mayst see\r\nPlainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,\r\nHow I am galled,—mightst bespice a cup,\r\nTo give mine enemy a lasting wink;\r\nWhich draught to me were cordial.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nSir, my lord,\r\nI could do this, and that with no rash potion,\r\nBut with a ling’ring dram, that should not work\r\nMaliciously like poison. But I cannot\r\nBelieve this crack to be in my dread mistress,\r\nSo sovereignly being honourable.\r\nI have lov’d thee,—\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nMake that thy question, and go rot!\r\nDost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,\r\nTo appoint myself in this vexation; sully\r\nThe purity and whiteness of my sheets,\r\n(Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted\r\nIs goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps)\r\nGive scandal to the blood o’ th’ prince, my son,\r\n(Who I do think is mine, and love as mine)\r\nWithout ripe moving to’t? Would I do this?\r\nCould man so blench?\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nI must believe you, sir:\r\nI do; and will fetch off Bohemia for’t;\r\nProvided that, when he’s remov’d, your highness\r\nWill take again your queen as yours at first,\r\nEven for your son’s sake, and thereby for sealing\r\nThe injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms\r\nKnown and allied to yours.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nThou dost advise me\r\nEven so as I mine own course have set down:\r\nI’ll give no blemish to her honour, none.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nMy lord,\r\nGo then; and with a countenance as clear\r\nAs friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia\r\nAnd with your queen. I am his cupbearer.\r\nIf from me he have wholesome beverage,\r\nAccount me not your servant.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nThis is all:\r\nDo’t, and thou hast the one half of my heart;\r\nDo’t not, thou splitt’st thine own.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nI’ll do’t, my lord.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nI will seem friendly, as thou hast advis’d me.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nO miserable lady! But, for me,\r\nWhat case stand I in? I must be the poisoner\r\nOf good Polixenes, and my ground to do’t\r\nIs the obedience to a master; one\r\nWho, in rebellion with himself, will have\r\nAll that are his so too. To do this deed,\r\nPromotion follows. If I could find example\r\nOf thousands that had struck anointed kings\r\nAnd flourish’d after, I’d not do’t. But since\r\nNor brass, nor stone, nor parchment, bears not one,\r\nLet villainy itself forswear’t. I must\r\nForsake the court: to do’t, or no, is certain\r\nTo me a break-neck. Happy star reign now!\r\nHere comes Bohemia.\r\n\r\n Enter Polixenes.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nThis is strange. Methinks\r\nMy favour here begins to warp. Not speak?\r\nGood day, Camillo.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nHail, most royal sir!\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nWhat is the news i’ th’ court?\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nNone rare, my lord.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nThe king hath on him such a countenance\r\nAs he had lost some province, and a region\r\nLov’d as he loves himself. Even now I met him\r\nWith customary compliment, when he,\r\nWafting his eyes to the contrary, and falling\r\nA lip of much contempt, speeds from me, and\r\nSo leaves me to consider what is breeding\r\nThat changes thus his manners.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nI dare not know, my lord.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nHow, dare not? Do not? Do you know, and dare not?\r\nBe intelligent to me? ’Tis thereabouts;\r\nFor, to yourself, what you do know, you must,\r\nAnd cannot say you dare not. Good Camillo,\r\nYour chang’d complexions are to me a mirror\r\nWhich shows me mine chang’d too; for I must be\r\nA party in this alteration, finding\r\nMyself thus alter’d with’t.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nThere is a sickness\r\nWhich puts some of us in distemper, but\r\nI cannot name the disease, and it is caught\r\nOf you that yet are well.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nHow caught of me?\r\nMake me not sighted like the basilisk.\r\nI have look’d on thousands who have sped the better\r\nBy my regard, but kill’d none so. Camillo,—\r\nAs you are certainly a gentleman, thereto\r\nClerk-like, experienc’d, which no less adorns\r\nOur gentry than our parents’ noble names,\r\nIn whose success we are gentle,—I beseech you,\r\nIf you know aught which does behove my knowledge\r\nThereof to be inform’d, imprison’t not\r\nIn ignorant concealment.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nI may not answer.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nA sickness caught of me, and yet I well?\r\nI must be answer’d. Dost thou hear, Camillo,\r\nI conjure thee, by all the parts of man\r\nWhich honour does acknowledge, whereof the least\r\nIs not this suit of mine, that thou declare\r\nWhat incidency thou dost guess of harm\r\nIs creeping toward me; how far off, how near;\r\nWhich way to be prevented, if to be;\r\nIf not, how best to bear it.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nSir, I will tell you;\r\nSince I am charg’d in honour, and by him\r\nThat I think honourable. Therefore mark my counsel,\r\nWhich must be ev’n as swiftly follow’d as\r\nI mean to utter it, or both yourself and me\r\nCry lost, and so goodnight!\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nOn, good Camillo.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nI am appointed him to murder you.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nBy whom, Camillo?\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nBy the king.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nFor what?\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nHe thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,\r\nAs he had seen’t or been an instrument\r\nTo vice you to’t, that you have touch’d his queen\r\nForbiddenly.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nO, then my best blood turn\r\nTo an infected jelly, and my name\r\nBe yok’d with his that did betray the Best!\r\nTurn then my freshest reputation to\r\nA savour that may strike the dullest nostril\r\nWhere I arrive, and my approach be shunn’d,\r\nNay, hated too, worse than the great’st infection\r\nThat e’er was heard or read!\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nSwear his thought over\r\nBy each particular star in heaven and\r\nBy all their influences, you may as well\r\nForbid the sea for to obey the moon\r\nAs or by oath remove or counsel shake\r\nThe fabric of his folly, whose foundation\r\nIs pil’d upon his faith, and will continue\r\nThe standing of his body.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nHow should this grow?\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nI know not: but I am sure ’tis safer to\r\nAvoid what’s grown than question how ’tis born.\r\nIf therefore you dare trust my honesty,\r\nThat lies enclosed in this trunk, which you\r\nShall bear along impawn’d, away tonight.\r\nYour followers I will whisper to the business,\r\nAnd will by twos and threes, at several posterns,\r\nClear them o’ th’ city. For myself, I’ll put\r\nMy fortunes to your service, which are here\r\nBy this discovery lost. Be not uncertain,\r\nFor, by the honour of my parents, I\r\nHave utter’d truth: which if you seek to prove,\r\nI dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer\r\nThan one condemned by the king’s own mouth,\r\nThereon his execution sworn.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nI do believe thee.\r\nI saw his heart in ’s face. Give me thy hand,\r\nBe pilot to me, and thy places shall\r\nStill neighbour mine. My ships are ready, and\r\nMy people did expect my hence departure\r\nTwo days ago. This jealousy\r\nIs for a precious creature: as she’s rare,\r\nMust it be great; and, as his person’s mighty,\r\nMust it be violent; and as he does conceive\r\nHe is dishonour’d by a man which ever\r\nProfess’d to him, why, his revenges must\r\nIn that be made more bitter. Fear o’ershades me.\r\nGood expedition be my friend, and comfort\r\nThe gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing\r\nOf his ill-ta’en suspicion! Come, Camillo,\r\nI will respect thee as a father if\r\nThou bear’st my life off hence. Let us avoid.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nIt is in mine authority to command\r\nThe keys of all the posterns: please your highness\r\nTo take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\nACT II\r\n\r\nSCENE I. Sicilia. A Room in the Palace.\r\n\r\n Enter Hermione, Mamillius and Ladies.\r\n\r\nHERMIONE.\r\nTake the boy to you: he so troubles me,\r\n’Tis past enduring.\r\n\r\nFIRST LADY.\r\nCome, my gracious lord,\r\nShall I be your playfellow?\r\n\r\nMAMILLIUS.\r\nNo, I’ll none of you.\r\n\r\nFIRST LADY.\r\nWhy, my sweet lord?\r\n\r\nMAMILLIUS.\r\nYou’ll kiss me hard, and speak to me as if\r\nI were a baby still. I love you better.\r\n\r\nSECOND LADY.\r\nAnd why so, my lord?\r\n\r\nMAMILLIUS.\r\nNot for because\r\nYour brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,\r\nBecome some women best, so that there be not\r\nToo much hair there, but in a semicircle\r\nOr a half-moon made with a pen.\r\n\r\nSECOND LADY.\r\nWho taught this?\r\n\r\nMAMILLIUS.\r\nI learn’d it out of women’s faces. Pray now,\r\nWhat colour are your eyebrows?\r\n\r\nFIRST LADY.\r\nBlue, my lord.\r\n\r\nMAMILLIUS.\r\nNay, that’s a mock. I have seen a lady’s nose\r\nThat has been blue, but not her eyebrows.\r\n\r\nFIRST LADY.\r\nHark ye,\r\nThe queen your mother rounds apace. We shall\r\nPresent our services to a fine new prince\r\nOne of these days, and then you’d wanton with us,\r\nIf we would have you.\r\n\r\nSECOND LADY.\r\nShe is spread of late\r\nInto a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!\r\n\r\nHERMIONE.\r\nWhat wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now\r\nI am for you again. Pray you sit by us,\r\nAnd tell ’s a tale.\r\n\r\nMAMILLIUS.\r\nMerry or sad shall’t be?\r\n\r\nHERMIONE.\r\nAs merry as you will.\r\n\r\nMAMILLIUS.\r\nA sad tale’s best for winter. I have one\r\nOf sprites and goblins.\r\n\r\nHERMIONE.\r\nLet’s have that, good sir.\r\nCome on, sit down. Come on, and do your best\r\nTo fright me with your sprites: you’re powerful at it.\r\n\r\nMAMILLIUS.\r\nThere was a man,—\r\n\r\nHERMIONE.\r\nNay, come, sit down, then on.\r\n\r\nMAMILLIUS.\r\nDwelt by a churchyard. I will tell it softly,\r\nYond crickets shall not hear it.\r\n\r\nHERMIONE.\r\nCome on then,\r\nAnd give’t me in mine ear.\r\n\r\n Enter Leontes, Antigonus, Lords and Guards.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nWas he met there? his train? Camillo with him?\r\n\r\nFIRST LORD.\r\nBehind the tuft of pines I met them, never\r\nSaw I men scour so on their way: I ey’d them\r\nEven to their ships.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nHow blest am I\r\nIn my just censure, in my true opinion!\r\nAlack, for lesser knowledge! How accurs’d\r\nIn being so blest! There may be in the cup\r\nA spider steep’d, and one may drink, depart,\r\nAnd yet partake no venom, for his knowledge\r\nIs not infected; but if one present\r\nTh’ abhorr’d ingredient to his eye, make known\r\nHow he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,\r\nWith violent hefts. I have drunk, and seen the spider.\r\nCamillo was his help in this, his pander.\r\nThere is a plot against my life, my crown;\r\nAll’s true that is mistrusted. That false villain\r\nWhom I employ’d, was pre-employ’d by him.\r\nHe has discover’d my design, and I\r\nRemain a pinch’d thing; yea, a very trick\r\nFor them to play at will. How came the posterns\r\nSo easily open?\r\n\r\nFIRST LORD.\r\nBy his great authority,\r\nWhich often hath no less prevail’d than so\r\nOn your command.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nI know’t too well.\r\nGive me the boy. I am glad you did not nurse him.\r\nThough he does bear some signs of me, yet you\r\nHave too much blood in him.\r\n\r\nHERMIONE.\r\nWhat is this? sport?\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nBear the boy hence, he shall not come about her,\r\nAway with him, and let her sport herself\r\nWith that she’s big with; for ’tis Polixenes\r\nHas made thee swell thus.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Mamillius with some of the Guards._]\r\n\r\nHERMIONE.\r\nBut I’d say he had not,\r\nAnd I’ll be sworn you would believe my saying,\r\nHowe’er you learn th’ nayward.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nYou, my lords,\r\nLook on her, mark her well. Be but about\r\nTo say, “she is a goodly lady,” and\r\nThe justice of your hearts will thereto add\r\n“’Tis pity she’s not honest, honourable”:\r\nPraise her but for this her without-door form,\r\nWhich on my faith deserves high speech, and straight\r\nThe shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands\r\nThat calumny doth use—O, I am out,\r\nThat mercy does; for calumny will sear\r\nVirtue itself—these shrugs, these hum’s, and ha’s,\r\nWhen you have said “she’s goodly,” come between,\r\nEre you can say “she’s honest”: but be it known,\r\nFrom him that has most cause to grieve it should be,\r\nShe’s an adultress!\r\n\r\nHERMIONE.\r\nShould a villain say so,\r\nThe most replenish’d villain in the world,\r\nHe were as much more villain: you, my lord,\r\nDo but mistake.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nYou have mistook, my lady,\r\nPolixenes for Leontes. O thou thing,\r\nWhich I’ll not call a creature of thy place,\r\nLest barbarism, making me the precedent,\r\nShould a like language use to all degrees,\r\nAnd mannerly distinguishment leave out\r\nBetwixt the prince and beggar. I have said\r\nShe’s an adultress; I have said with whom:\r\nMore, she’s a traitor, and Camillo is\r\nA federary with her; and one that knows\r\nWhat she should shame to know herself\r\nBut with her most vile principal, that she’s\r\nA bed-swerver, even as bad as those\r\nThat vulgars give bold’st titles; ay, and privy\r\nTo this their late escape.\r\n\r\nHERMIONE.\r\nNo, by my life,\r\nPrivy to none of this. How will this grieve you,\r\nWhen you shall come to clearer knowledge, that\r\nYou thus have publish’d me! Gentle my lord,\r\nYou scarce can right me throughly then, to say\r\nYou did mistake.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nNo. If I mistake\r\nIn those foundations which I build upon,\r\nThe centre is not big enough to bear\r\nA school-boy’s top. Away with her to prison!\r\nHe who shall speak for her is afar off guilty\r\nBut that he speaks.\r\n\r\nHERMIONE.\r\nThere’s some ill planet reigns:\r\nI must be patient till the heavens look\r\nWith an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,\r\nI am not prone to weeping, as our sex\r\nCommonly are; the want of which vain dew\r\nPerchance shall dry your pities. But I have\r\nThat honourable grief lodg’d here which burns\r\nWorse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,\r\nWith thoughts so qualified as your charities\r\nShall best instruct you, measure me; and so\r\nThe king’s will be perform’d.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nShall I be heard?\r\n\r\nHERMIONE.\r\nWho is’t that goes with me? Beseech your highness\r\nMy women may be with me, for you see\r\nMy plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools;\r\nThere is no cause: when you shall know your mistress\r\nHas deserv’d prison, then abound in tears\r\nAs I come out: this action I now go on\r\nIs for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:\r\nI never wish’d to see you sorry; now\r\nI trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nGo, do our bidding. Hence!\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Queen and Ladies with Guards._]\r\n\r\nFIRST LORD.\r\nBeseech your highness, call the queen again.\r\n\r\nANTIGONUS.\r\nBe certain what you do, sir, lest your justice\r\nProve violence, in the which three great ones suffer,\r\nYourself, your queen, your son.\r\n\r\nFIRST LORD.\r\nFor her, my lord,\r\nI dare my life lay down, and will do’t, sir,\r\nPlease you to accept it, that the queen is spotless\r\nI’ th’ eyes of heaven and to you—I mean\r\nIn this which you accuse her.\r\n\r\nANTIGONUS.\r\nIf it prove\r\nShe’s otherwise, I’ll keep my stables where\r\nI lodge my wife; I’ll go in couples with her;\r\nThan when I feel and see her no further trust her.\r\nFor every inch of woman in the world,\r\nAy, every dram of woman’s flesh, is false,\r\nIf she be.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nHold your peaces.\r\n\r\nFIRST LORD.\r\nGood my lord,—\r\n\r\nANTIGONUS.\r\nIt is for you we speak, not for ourselves:\r\nYou are abus’d, and by some putter-on\r\nThat will be damn’d for’t: would I knew the villain,\r\nI would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw’d,\r\nI have three daughters; the eldest is eleven;\r\nThe second and the third, nine and some five;\r\nIf this prove true, they’ll pay for’t. By mine honour,\r\nI’ll geld ’em all; fourteen they shall not see,\r\nTo bring false generations: they are co-heirs,\r\nAnd I had rather glib myself than they\r\nShould not produce fair issue.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nCease; no more.\r\nYou smell this business with a sense as cold\r\nAs is a dead man’s nose: but I do see’t and feel’t,\r\nAs you feel doing thus; and see withal\r\nThe instruments that feel.\r\n\r\nANTIGONUS.\r\nIf it be so,\r\nWe need no grave to bury honesty.\r\nThere’s not a grain of it the face to sweeten\r\nOf the whole dungy earth.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nWhat! Lack I credit?\r\n\r\nFIRST LORD.\r\nI had rather you did lack than I, my lord,\r\nUpon this ground: and more it would content me\r\nTo have her honour true than your suspicion,\r\nBe blam’d for’t how you might.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nWhy, what need we\r\nCommune with you of this, but rather follow\r\nOur forceful instigation? Our prerogative\r\nCalls not your counsels, but our natural goodness\r\nImparts this; which, if you, or stupified\r\nOr seeming so in skill, cannot or will not\r\nRelish a truth, like us, inform yourselves\r\nWe need no more of your advice: the matter,\r\nThe loss, the gain, the ord’ring on’t, is all\r\nProperly ours.\r\n\r\nANTIGONUS.\r\nAnd I wish, my liege,\r\nYou had only in your silent judgement tried it,\r\nWithout more overture.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nHow could that be?\r\nEither thou art most ignorant by age,\r\nOr thou wert born a fool. Camillo’s flight,\r\nAdded to their familiarity,\r\n(Which was as gross as ever touch’d conjecture,\r\nThat lack’d sight only, nought for approbation\r\nBut only seeing, all other circumstances\r\nMade up to th’ deed) doth push on this proceeding.\r\nYet, for a greater confirmation\r\n(For in an act of this importance, ’twere\r\nMost piteous to be wild), I have dispatch’d in post\r\nTo sacred Delphos, to Apollo’s temple,\r\nCleomenes and Dion, whom you know\r\nOf stuff’d sufficiency: now from the oracle\r\nThey will bring all, whose spiritual counsel had,\r\nShall stop or spur me. Have I done well?\r\n\r\nFIRST LORD.\r\nWell done, my lord.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nThough I am satisfied, and need no more\r\nThan what I know, yet shall the oracle\r\nGive rest to the minds of others, such as he\r\nWhose ignorant credulity will not\r\nCome up to th’ truth. So have we thought it good\r\nFrom our free person she should be confin’d,\r\nLest that the treachery of the two fled hence\r\nBe left her to perform. Come, follow us;\r\nWe are to speak in public; for this business\r\nWill raise us all.\r\n\r\nANTIGONUS.\r\n[_Aside._] To laughter, as I take it,\r\nIf the good truth were known.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. The same. The outer Room of a Prison.\r\n\r\n Enter Paulina, a Gentleman and Attendants.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nThe keeper of the prison, call to him;\r\nLet him have knowledge who I am.\r\n\r\n [_Exit the Gentleman._]\r\n\r\nGood lady!\r\nNo court in Europe is too good for thee;\r\nWhat dost thou then in prison?\r\n\r\n Enter Gentleman with the Gaoler.\r\n\r\nNow, good sir,\r\nYou know me, do you not?\r\n\r\nGAOLER.\r\nFor a worthy lady\r\nAnd one who much I honour.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nPray you then,\r\nConduct me to the queen.\r\n\r\nGAOLER.\r\nI may not, madam.\r\nTo the contrary I have express commandment.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nHere’s ado, to lock up honesty and honour from\r\nTh’ access of gentle visitors! Is’t lawful, pray you,\r\nTo see her women? any of them? Emilia?\r\n\r\nGAOLER.\r\nSo please you, madam,\r\nTo put apart these your attendants, I\r\nShall bring Emilia forth.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nI pray now, call her.\r\nWithdraw yourselves.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Gentleman and Attendants._]\r\n\r\nGAOLER.\r\nAnd, madam,\r\nI must be present at your conference.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nWell, be’t so, prithee.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Gaoler._]\r\n\r\nHere’s such ado to make no stain a stain\r\nAs passes colouring.\r\n\r\n Re-enter Gaoler with Emilia.\r\n\r\nDear gentlewoman,\r\nHow fares our gracious lady?\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nAs well as one so great and so forlorn\r\nMay hold together: on her frights and griefs,\r\n(Which never tender lady hath borne greater)\r\nShe is, something before her time, deliver’d.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nA boy?\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nA daughter; and a goodly babe,\r\nLusty, and like to live: the queen receives\r\nMuch comfort in ’t; says “My poor prisoner,\r\nI am as innocent as you.”\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nI dare be sworn.\r\nThese dangerous unsafe lunes i’ th’ king, beshrew them!\r\nHe must be told on’t, and he shall: the office\r\nBecomes a woman best. I’ll take’t upon me.\r\nIf I prove honey-mouth’d, let my tongue blister,\r\nAnd never to my red-look’d anger be\r\nThe trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia,\r\nCommend my best obedience to the queen.\r\nIf she dares trust me with her little babe,\r\nI’ll show’t the king, and undertake to be\r\nHer advocate to th’ loud’st. We do not know\r\nHow he may soften at the sight o’ th’ child:\r\nThe silence often of pure innocence\r\nPersuades, when speaking fails.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nMost worthy madam,\r\nYour honour and your goodness is so evident,\r\nThat your free undertaking cannot miss\r\nA thriving issue: there is no lady living\r\nSo meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship\r\nTo visit the next room, I’ll presently\r\nAcquaint the queen of your most noble offer,\r\nWho but today hammer’d of this design,\r\nBut durst not tempt a minister of honour,\r\nLest she should be denied.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nTell her, Emilia,\r\nI’ll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from ’t\r\nAs boldness from my bosom, let’t not be doubted\r\nI shall do good.\r\n\r\nEMILIA.\r\nNow be you blest for it!\r\nI’ll to the queen: please you come something nearer.\r\n\r\nGAOLER.\r\nMadam, if ’t please the queen to send the babe,\r\nI know not what I shall incur to pass it,\r\nHaving no warrant.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nYou need not fear it, sir:\r\nThis child was prisoner to the womb, and is,\r\nBy law and process of great nature thence\r\nFreed and enfranchis’d: not a party to\r\nThe anger of the king, nor guilty of,\r\nIf any be, the trespass of the queen.\r\n\r\nGAOLER.\r\nI do believe it.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nDo not you fear: upon mine honour, I\r\nWill stand betwixt you and danger.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. The same. A Room in the Palace.\r\n\r\n Enter Leontes, Antigonus, Lords and other Attendants.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nNor night nor day no rest: it is but weakness\r\nTo bear the matter thus, mere weakness. If\r\nThe cause were not in being,—part o’ th’ cause,\r\nShe th’ adultress; for the harlot king\r\nIs quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank\r\nAnd level of my brain, plot-proof. But she\r\nI can hook to me. Say that she were gone,\r\nGiven to the fire, a moiety of my rest\r\nMight come to me again. Who’s there?\r\n\r\nFIRST ATTENDANT.\r\nMy lord.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nHow does the boy?\r\n\r\nFIRST ATTENDANT.\r\nHe took good rest tonight;\r\n’Tis hop’d his sickness is discharg’d.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nTo see his nobleness,\r\nConceiving the dishonour of his mother.\r\nHe straight declin’d, droop’d, took it deeply,\r\nFasten’d and fix’d the shame on’t in himself,\r\nThrew off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,\r\nAnd downright languish’d. Leave me solely: go,\r\nSee how he fares.\r\n\r\n [_Exit First Attendant._]\r\n\r\nFie, fie! no thought of him.\r\nThe very thought of my revenges that way\r\nRecoil upon me: in himself too mighty,\r\nAnd in his parties, his alliance. Let him be,\r\nUntil a time may serve. For present vengeance,\r\nTake it on her. Camillo and Polixenes\r\nLaugh at me; make their pastime at my sorrow:\r\nThey should not laugh if I could reach them, nor\r\nShall she, within my power.\r\n\r\n Enter Paulina carrying a baby, with Antigonus, lords and servants.\r\n\r\nFIRST LORD.\r\nYou must not enter.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nNay, rather, good my lords, be second to me:\r\nFear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,\r\nThan the queen’s life? a gracious innocent soul,\r\nMore free than he is jealous.\r\n\r\nANTIGONUS.\r\nThat’s enough.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nMadam, he hath not slept tonight; commanded\r\nNone should come at him.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nNot so hot, good sir;\r\nI come to bring him sleep. ’Tis such as you,\r\nThat creep like shadows by him, and do sigh\r\nAt each his needless heavings,—such as you\r\nNourish the cause of his awaking. I\r\nDo come with words as med’cinal as true,\r\nHonest as either, to purge him of that humour\r\nThat presses him from sleep.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nWhat noise there, ho?\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nNo noise, my lord; but needful conference\r\nAbout some gossips for your highness.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nHow!\r\nAway with that audacious lady! Antigonus,\r\nI charg’d thee that she should not come about me.\r\nI knew she would.\r\n\r\nANTIGONUS.\r\nI told her so, my lord,\r\nOn your displeasure’s peril and on mine,\r\nShe should not visit you.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nWhat, canst not rule her?\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nFrom all dishonesty he can. In this,\r\nUnless he take the course that you have done,\r\nCommit me for committing honour—trust it,\r\nHe shall not rule me.\r\n\r\nANTIGONUS.\r\nLa you now, you hear.\r\nWhen she will take the rein I let her run;\r\nBut she’ll not stumble.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nGood my liege, I come,—\r\nAnd, I beseech you hear me, who professes\r\nMyself your loyal servant, your physician,\r\nYour most obedient counsellor, yet that dares\r\nLess appear so, in comforting your evils,\r\nThan such as most seem yours—I say I come\r\nFrom your good queen.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nGood queen!\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nGood queen, my lord, good queen: I say, good queen,\r\nAnd would by combat make her good, so were I\r\nA man, the worst about you.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nForce her hence.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nLet him that makes but trifles of his eyes\r\nFirst hand me: on mine own accord I’ll off;\r\nBut first I’ll do my errand. The good queen,\r\n(For she is good) hath brought you forth a daughter;\r\nHere ’tis; commends it to your blessing.\r\n\r\n [_Laying down the child._]\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nOut!\r\nA mankind witch! Hence with her, out o’ door:\r\nA most intelligencing bawd!\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nNot so.\r\nI am as ignorant in that as you\r\nIn so entitling me; and no less honest\r\nThan you are mad; which is enough, I’ll warrant,\r\nAs this world goes, to pass for honest.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nTraitors!\r\nWill you not push her out? [_To Antigonus._] Give her the bastard,\r\nThou dotard! Thou art woman-tir’d, unroosted\r\nBy thy Dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard,\r\nTake’t up, I say; give’t to thy crone.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nFor ever\r\nUnvenerable be thy hands, if thou\r\nTak’st up the princess by that forced baseness\r\nWhich he has put upon ’t!\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nHe dreads his wife.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nSo I would you did; then ’twere past all doubt\r\nYou’d call your children yours.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nA nest of traitors!\r\n\r\nANTIGONUS.\r\nI am none, by this good light.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nNor I; nor any\r\nBut one that’s here, and that’s himself. For he\r\nThe sacred honour of himself, his queen’s,\r\nHis hopeful son’s, his babe’s, betrays to slander,\r\nWhose sting is sharper than the sword’s; and will not,\r\n(For, as the case now stands, it is a curse\r\nHe cannot be compell’d to’t) once remove\r\nThe root of his opinion, which is rotten\r\nAs ever oak or stone was sound.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nA callat\r\nOf boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband,\r\nAnd now baits me! This brat is none of mine;\r\nIt is the issue of Polixenes.\r\nHence with it, and together with the dam\r\nCommit them to the fire.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nIt is yours;\r\nAnd, might we lay th’ old proverb to your charge,\r\nSo like you ’tis the worse. Behold, my lords,\r\nAlthough the print be little, the whole matter\r\nAnd copy of the father: eye, nose, lip,\r\nThe trick of ’s frown, his forehead; nay, the valley,\r\nThe pretty dimples of his chin and cheek; his smiles;\r\nThe very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger:\r\nAnd thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it\r\nSo like to him that got it, if thou hast\r\nThe ordering of the mind too, ’mongst all colours\r\nNo yellow in ’t, lest she suspect, as he does,\r\nHer children not her husband’s!\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nA gross hag!\r\nAnd, losel, thou art worthy to be hang’d\r\nThat wilt not stay her tongue.\r\n\r\nANTIGONUS.\r\nHang all the husbands\r\nThat cannot do that feat, you’ll leave yourself\r\nHardly one subject.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nOnce more, take her hence.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nA most unworthy and unnatural lord\r\nCan do no more.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nI’ll have thee burnt.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nI care not.\r\nIt is an heretic that makes the fire,\r\nNot she which burns in ’t. I’ll not call you tyrant;\r\nBut this most cruel usage of your queen,\r\nNot able to produce more accusation\r\nThan your own weak-hing’d fancy, something savours\r\nOf tyranny, and will ignoble make you,\r\nYea, scandalous to the world.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nOn your allegiance,\r\nOut of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,\r\nWhere were her life? She durst not call me so,\r\nIf she did know me one. Away with her!\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nI pray you, do not push me; I’ll be gone.\r\nLook to your babe, my lord; ’tis yours: Jove send her\r\nA better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?\r\nYou that are thus so tender o’er his follies,\r\nWill never do him good, not one of you.\r\nSo, so. Farewell; we are gone.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nThou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.\r\nMy child? Away with’t. Even thou, that hast\r\nA heart so tender o’er it, take it hence,\r\nAnd see it instantly consum’d with fire;\r\nEven thou, and none but thou. Take it up straight:\r\nWithin this hour bring me word ’tis done,\r\nAnd by good testimony, or I’ll seize thy life,\r\nWith that thou else call’st thine. If thou refuse\r\nAnd wilt encounter with my wrath, say so;\r\nThe bastard brains with these my proper hands\r\nShall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire;\r\nFor thou set’st on thy wife.\r\n\r\nANTIGONUS.\r\nI did not, sir:\r\nThese lords, my noble fellows, if they please,\r\nCan clear me in ’t.\r\n\r\nLORDS\r\nWe can: my royal liege,\r\nHe is not guilty of her coming hither.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nYou’re liars all.\r\n\r\nFIRST LORD.\r\nBeseech your highness, give us better credit:\r\nWe have always truly serv’d you; and beseech\r\nSo to esteem of us. And on our knees we beg,\r\nAs recompense of our dear services\r\nPast and to come, that you do change this purpose,\r\nWhich being so horrible, so bloody, must\r\nLead on to some foul issue. We all kneel.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nI am a feather for each wind that blows.\r\nShall I live on to see this bastard kneel\r\nAnd call me father? better burn it now\r\nThan curse it then. But be it; let it live.\r\nIt shall not neither. [_To Antigonus._] You, sir, come you hither,\r\nYou that have been so tenderly officious\r\nWith Lady Margery, your midwife, there,\r\nTo save this bastard’s life—for ’tis a bastard,\r\nSo sure as this beard’s grey. What will you adventure\r\nTo save this brat’s life?\r\n\r\nANTIGONUS.\r\nAnything, my lord,\r\nThat my ability may undergo,\r\nAnd nobleness impose: at least thus much:\r\nI’ll pawn the little blood which I have left\r\nTo save the innocent. Anything possible.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nIt shall be possible. Swear by this sword\r\nThou wilt perform my bidding.\r\n\r\nANTIGONUS.\r\nI will, my lord.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nMark, and perform it, seest thou? for the fail\r\nOf any point in’t shall not only be\r\nDeath to thyself, but to thy lewd-tongu’d wife,\r\nWhom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,\r\nAs thou art liegeman to us, that thou carry\r\nThis female bastard hence, and that thou bear it\r\nTo some remote and desert place, quite out\r\nOf our dominions; and that there thou leave it,\r\nWithout more mercy, to it own protection\r\nAnd favour of the climate. As by strange fortune\r\nIt came to us, I do in justice charge thee,\r\nOn thy soul’s peril and thy body’s torture,\r\nThat thou commend it strangely to some place\r\nWhere chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.\r\n\r\nANTIGONUS.\r\nI swear to do this, though a present death\r\nHad been more merciful. Come on, poor babe:\r\nSome powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens\r\nTo be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say,\r\nCasting their savageness aside, have done\r\nLike offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous\r\nIn more than this deed does require! And blessing\r\nAgainst this cruelty, fight on thy side,\r\nPoor thing, condemn’d to loss!\r\n\r\n [_Exit with the child._]\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nNo, I’ll not rear\r\nAnother’s issue.\r\n\r\n Enter a Servant.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nPlease your highness, posts\r\nFrom those you sent to th’ oracle are come\r\nAn hour since: Cleomenes and Dion,\r\nBeing well arriv’d from Delphos, are both landed,\r\nHasting to th’ court.\r\n\r\nFIRST LORD.\r\nSo please you, sir, their speed\r\nHath been beyond account.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nTwenty-three days\r\nThey have been absent: ’tis good speed; foretells\r\nThe great Apollo suddenly will have\r\nThe truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords;\r\nSummon a session, that we may arraign\r\nOur most disloyal lady; for, as she hath\r\nBeen publicly accus’d, so shall she have\r\nA just and open trial. While she lives,\r\nMy heart will be a burden to me. Leave me,\r\nAnd think upon my bidding.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\nACT III\r\n\r\nSCENE I. Sicilia. A Street in some Town.\r\n\r\n Enter Cleomenes and Dion.\r\n\r\nCLEOMENES\r\nThe climate’s delicate; the air most sweet,\r\nFertile the isle, the temple much surpassing\r\nThe common praise it bears.\r\n\r\nDION.\r\nI shall report,\r\nFor most it caught me, the celestial habits\r\n(Methinks I so should term them) and the reverence\r\nOf the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice!\r\nHow ceremonious, solemn, and unearthly,\r\nIt was i’ th’ offering!\r\n\r\nCLEOMENES\r\nBut of all, the burst\r\nAnd the ear-deaf’ning voice o’ th’ oracle,\r\nKin to Jove’s thunder, so surprised my sense\r\nThat I was nothing.\r\n\r\nDION.\r\nIf the event o’ th’ journey\r\nProve as successful to the queen,—O, be’t so!—\r\nAs it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,\r\nThe time is worth the use on’t.\r\n\r\nCLEOMENES\r\nGreat Apollo\r\nTurn all to th’ best! These proclamations,\r\nSo forcing faults upon Hermione,\r\nI little like.\r\n\r\nDION.\r\nThe violent carriage of it\r\nWill clear or end the business: when the oracle,\r\n(Thus by Apollo’s great divine seal’d up)\r\nShall the contents discover, something rare\r\nEven then will rush to knowledge. Go. Fresh horses!\r\nAnd gracious be the issue!\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. The same. A Court of Justice.\r\n\r\n Enter Leontes, Lords and Officers appear, properly seated.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nThis sessions (to our great grief we pronounce)\r\nEven pushes ’gainst our heart: the party tried\r\nThe daughter of a king, our wife, and one\r\nOf us too much belov’d. Let us be clear’d\r\nOf being tyrannous, since we so openly\r\nProceed in justice, which shall have due course,\r\nEven to the guilt or the purgation.\r\nProduce the prisoner.\r\n\r\nOFFICER.\r\nIt is his highness’ pleasure that the queen\r\nAppear in person here in court. Silence!\r\n\r\n Hermione is brought in guarded; Paulina and Ladies attending.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nRead the indictment.\r\n\r\nOFFICER.\r\n[_Reads._] “Hermione, queen to the worthy Leontes, king of Sicilia,\r\nthou art here accused and arraigned of high treason, in committing\r\nadultery with Polixenes, king of Bohemia; and conspiring with Camillo\r\nto take away the life of our sovereign lord the king, thy royal\r\nhusband: the pretence whereof being by circumstances partly laid open,\r\nthou, Hermione, contrary to the faith and allegiance of a true subject,\r\ndidst counsel and aid them, for their better safety, to fly away by\r\nnight.”\r\n\r\nHERMIONE.\r\nSince what I am to say must be but that\r\nWhich contradicts my accusation, and\r\nThe testimony on my part no other\r\nBut what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me\r\nTo say “Not guilty”. Mine integrity,\r\nBeing counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,\r\nBe so receiv’d. But thus, if powers divine\r\nBehold our human actions, as they do,\r\nI doubt not, then, but innocence shall make\r\nFalse accusation blush, and tyranny\r\nTremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,\r\nWho least will seem to do so, my past life\r\nHath been as continent, as chaste, as true,\r\nAs I am now unhappy; which is more\r\nThan history can pattern, though devis’d\r\nAnd play’d to take spectators. For behold me,\r\nA fellow of the royal bed, which owe\r\nA moiety of the throne, a great king’s daughter,\r\nThe mother to a hopeful prince, here standing\r\nTo prate and talk for life and honour ’fore\r\nWho please to come and hear. For life, I prize it\r\nAs I weigh grief, which I would spare. For honour,\r\n’Tis a derivative from me to mine,\r\nAnd only that I stand for. I appeal\r\nTo your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes\r\nCame to your court, how I was in your grace,\r\nHow merited to be so; since he came,\r\nWith what encounter so uncurrent I\r\nHave strain’d t’ appear thus: if one jot beyond\r\nThe bound of honour, or in act or will\r\nThat way inclining, harden’d be the hearts\r\nOf all that hear me, and my near’st of kin\r\nCry fie upon my grave!\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nI ne’er heard yet\r\nThat any of these bolder vices wanted\r\nLess impudence to gainsay what they did\r\nThan to perform it first.\r\n\r\nHERMIONE.\r\nThat’s true enough;\r\nThough ’tis a saying, sir, not due to me.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nYou will not own it.\r\n\r\nHERMIONE.\r\nMore than mistress of\r\nWhich comes to me in name of fault, I must not\r\nAt all acknowledge. For Polixenes,\r\nWith whom I am accus’d, I do confess\r\nI lov’d him as in honour he requir’d,\r\nWith such a kind of love as might become\r\nA lady like me; with a love even such,\r\nSo and no other, as yourself commanded:\r\nWhich not to have done, I think had been in me\r\nBoth disobedience and ingratitude\r\nTo you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,\r\nEver since it could speak, from an infant, freely,\r\nThat it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,\r\nI know not how it tastes, though it be dish’d\r\nFor me to try how: all I know of it\r\nIs that Camillo was an honest man;\r\nAnd why he left your court, the gods themselves,\r\nWotting no more than I, are ignorant.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nYou knew of his departure, as you know\r\nWhat you have underta’en to do in ’s absence.\r\n\r\nHERMIONE.\r\nSir,\r\nYou speak a language that I understand not:\r\nMy life stands in the level of your dreams,\r\nWhich I’ll lay down.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nYour actions are my dreams.\r\nYou had a bastard by Polixenes,\r\nAnd I but dream’d it. As you were past all shame\r\n(Those of your fact are so) so past all truth,\r\nWhich to deny concerns more than avails; for as\r\nThy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,\r\nNo father owning it (which is, indeed,\r\nMore criminal in thee than it), so thou\r\nShalt feel our justice; in whose easiest passage\r\nLook for no less than death.\r\n\r\nHERMIONE.\r\nSir, spare your threats:\r\nThe bug which you would fright me with, I seek.\r\nTo me can life be no commodity.\r\nThe crown and comfort of my life, your favour,\r\nI do give lost, for I do feel it gone,\r\nBut know not how it went. My second joy,\r\nAnd first-fruits of my body, from his presence\r\nI am barr’d, like one infectious. My third comfort,\r\nStarr’d most unluckily, is from my breast,\r\n(The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth)\r\nHal’d out to murder; myself on every post\r\nProclaim’d a strumpet; with immodest hatred\r\nThe child-bed privilege denied, which ’longs\r\nTo women of all fashion; lastly, hurried\r\nHere to this place, i’ th’ open air, before\r\nI have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,\r\nTell me what blessings I have here alive,\r\nThat I should fear to die. Therefore proceed.\r\nBut yet hear this: mistake me not: no life,\r\nI prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,\r\nWhich I would free, if I shall be condemn’d\r\nUpon surmises, all proofs sleeping else\r\nBut what your jealousies awake, I tell you\r\n’Tis rigour, and not law. Your honours all,\r\nI do refer me to the oracle:\r\nApollo be my judge!\r\n\r\nFIRST LORD.\r\nThis your request\r\nIs altogether just: therefore bring forth,\r\nAnd in Apollo’s name, his oracle:\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt certain Officers._]\r\n\r\nHERMIONE.\r\nThe Emperor of Russia was my father.\r\nO that he were alive, and here beholding\r\nHis daughter’s trial! that he did but see\r\nThe flatness of my misery; yet with eyes\r\nOf pity, not revenge!\r\n\r\n Enter Officers with Cleomenes and Dion.\r\n\r\nOFFICER.\r\nYou here shall swear upon this sword of justice,\r\nThat you, Cleomenes and Dion, have\r\nBeen both at Delphos, and from thence have brought\r\nThis seal’d-up oracle, by the hand deliver’d\r\nOf great Apollo’s priest; and that since then\r\nYou have not dared to break the holy seal,\r\nNor read the secrets in’t.\r\n\r\nCLEOMENES, DION.\r\nAll this we swear.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nBreak up the seals and read.\r\n\r\nOFFICER.\r\n[_Reads._] “Hermione is chaste; Polixenes blameless; Camillo a true\r\nsubject; Leontes a jealous tyrant; his innocent babe truly begotten;\r\nand the king shall live without an heir, if that which is lost be not\r\nfound.”\r\n\r\nLORDS\r\nNow blessed be the great Apollo!\r\n\r\nHERMIONE.\r\nPraised!\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nHast thou read truth?\r\n\r\nOFFICER.\r\nAy, my lord, even so\r\nAs it is here set down.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nThere is no truth at all i’ th’ oracle:\r\nThe sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood.\r\n\r\n Enter a Servant hastily.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nMy lord the king, the king!\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nWhat is the business?\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nO sir, I shall be hated to report it.\r\nThe prince your son, with mere conceit and fear\r\nOf the queen’s speed, is gone.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nHow! gone?\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nIs dead.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nApollo’s angry, and the heavens themselves\r\nDo strike at my injustice.\r\n\r\n [_Hermione faints._]\r\n\r\nHow now there?\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nThis news is mortal to the queen. Look down\r\nAnd see what death is doing.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nTake her hence:\r\nHer heart is but o’ercharg’d; she will recover.\r\nI have too much believ’d mine own suspicion.\r\nBeseech you tenderly apply to her\r\nSome remedies for life.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Paulina and Ladies with Hermione._]\r\n\r\nApollo, pardon\r\nMy great profaneness ’gainst thine oracle!\r\nI’ll reconcile me to Polixenes,\r\nNew woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,\r\nWhom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;\r\nFor, being transported by my jealousies\r\nTo bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose\r\nCamillo for the minister to poison\r\nMy friend Polixenes: which had been done,\r\nBut that the good mind of Camillo tardied\r\nMy swift command, though I with death and with\r\nReward did threaten and encourage him,\r\nNot doing it and being done. He, most humane\r\nAnd fill’d with honour, to my kingly guest\r\nUnclasp’d my practice, quit his fortunes here,\r\nWhich you knew great, and to the certain hazard\r\nOf all incertainties himself commended,\r\nNo richer than his honour. How he glisters\r\nThorough my rust! And how his piety\r\nDoes my deeds make the blacker!\r\n\r\n Enter Paulina.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nWoe the while!\r\nO, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,\r\nBreak too!\r\n\r\nFIRST LORD.\r\nWhat fit is this, good lady?\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nWhat studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?\r\nWhat wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling\r\nIn leads or oils? What old or newer torture\r\nMust I receive, whose every word deserves\r\nTo taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny,\r\nTogether working with thy jealousies,\r\nFancies too weak for boys, too green and idle\r\nFor girls of nine. O, think what they have done,\r\nAnd then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all\r\nThy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.\r\nThat thou betray’dst Polixenes, ’twas nothing;\r\nThat did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant\r\nAnd damnable ingrateful; nor was’t much\r\nThou wouldst have poison’d good Camillo’s honour,\r\nTo have him kill a king; poor trespasses,\r\nMore monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon\r\nThe casting forth to crows thy baby daughter,\r\nTo be or none or little, though a devil\r\nWould have shed water out of fire ere done’t,\r\nNor is’t directly laid to thee the death\r\nOf the young prince, whose honourable thoughts,\r\nThoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart\r\nThat could conceive a gross and foolish sire\r\nBlemish’d his gracious dam: this is not, no,\r\nLaid to thy answer: but the last—O lords,\r\nWhen I have said, cry Woe!—the queen, the queen,\r\nThe sweet’st, dear’st creature’s dead, and vengeance for’t\r\nNot dropp’d down yet.\r\n\r\nFIRST LORD.\r\nThe higher powers forbid!\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nI say she’s dead: I’ll swear’t. If word nor oath\r\nPrevail not, go and see: if you can bring\r\nTincture, or lustre, in her lip, her eye,\r\nHeat outwardly or breath within, I’ll serve you\r\nAs I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!\r\nDo not repent these things, for they are heavier\r\nThan all thy woes can stir. Therefore betake thee\r\nTo nothing but despair. A thousand knees\r\nTen thousand years together, naked, fasting,\r\nUpon a barren mountain, and still winter\r\nIn storm perpetual, could not move the gods\r\nTo look that way thou wert.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nGo on, go on:\r\nThou canst not speak too much; I have deserv’d\r\nAll tongues to talk their bitterest.\r\n\r\nFIRST LORD.\r\nSay no more:\r\nHowe’er the business goes, you have made fault\r\nI’ th’ boldness of your speech.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nI am sorry for ’t:\r\nAll faults I make, when I shall come to know them,\r\nI do repent. Alas, I have show’d too much\r\nThe rashness of a woman: he is touch’d\r\nTo th’ noble heart. What’s gone and what’s past help,\r\nShould be past grief. Do not receive affliction\r\nAt my petition; I beseech you, rather\r\nLet me be punish’d, that have minded you\r\nOf what you should forget. Now, good my liege,\r\nSir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman:\r\nThe love I bore your queen—lo, fool again!\r\nI’ll speak of her no more, nor of your children.\r\nI’ll not remember you of my own lord,\r\nWho is lost too. Take your patience to you,\r\nAnd I’ll say nothing.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nThou didst speak but well\r\nWhen most the truth, which I receive much better\r\nThan to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me\r\nTo the dead bodies of my queen and son:\r\nOne grave shall be for both. Upon them shall\r\nThe causes of their death appear, unto\r\nOur shame perpetual. Once a day I’ll visit\r\nThe chapel where they lie, and tears shed there\r\nShall be my recreation. So long as nature\r\nWill bear up with this exercise, so long\r\nI daily vow to use it. Come, and lead me\r\nTo these sorrows.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. Bohemia.

In my conscience,\r\nThe heavens with that we have in hand are angry,\r\nAnd frown upon ’s.\r\n\r\nANTIGONUS.\r\nTheir sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;\r\nLook to thy bark: I’ll not be long before\r\nI call upon thee.\r\n\r\nMARINER.\r\nMake your best haste, and go not\r\nToo far i’ th’ land: ’tis like to be loud weather;\r\nBesides, this place is famous for the creatures\r\nOf prey that keep upon ’t.\r\n\r\nANTIGONUS.\r\nGo thou away:\r\nI’ll follow instantly.\r\n\r\nMARINER.\r\nI am glad at heart\r\nTo be so rid o’ th’ business.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nANTIGONUS.\r\nCome, poor babe.\r\nI have heard, but not believ’d, the spirits of the dead\r\nMay walk again: if such thing be, thy mother\r\nAppear’d to me last night; for ne’er was dream\r\nSo like a waking. To me comes a creature,\r\nSometimes her head on one side, some another.\r\nI never saw a vessel of like sorrow,\r\nSo fill’d and so becoming: in pure white robes,\r\nLike very sanctity, she did approach\r\nMy cabin where I lay: thrice bow’d before me,\r\nAnd, gasping to begin some speech, her eyes\r\nBecame two spouts. The fury spent, anon\r\nDid this break from her: “Good Antigonus,\r\nSince fate, against thy better disposition,\r\nHath made thy person for the thrower-out\r\nOf my poor babe, according to thine oath,\r\nPlaces remote enough are in Bohemia,\r\nThere weep, and leave it crying. And, for the babe\r\nIs counted lost for ever, Perdita\r\nI prithee call’t. For this ungentle business,\r\nPut on thee by my lord, thou ne’er shalt see\r\nThy wife Paulina more.” And so, with shrieks,\r\nShe melted into air. Affrighted much,\r\nI did in time collect myself and thought\r\nThis was so, and no slumber. Dreams are toys,\r\nYet for this once, yea, superstitiously,\r\nI will be squar’d by this. I do believe\r\nHermione hath suffer’d death, and that\r\nApollo would, this being indeed the issue\r\nOf King Polixenes, it should here be laid,\r\nEither for life or death, upon the earth\r\nOf its right father. Blossom, speed thee well! There lie; and there thy\r\ncharacter: there these;\r\n\r\n [_Laying down the child and a bundle._]\r\n\r\nWhich may if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,\r\nAnd still rest thine. The storm begins: poor wretch,\r\nThat for thy mother’s fault art thus expos’d\r\nTo loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,\r\nBut my heart bleeds, and most accurs’d am I\r\nTo be by oath enjoin’d to this. Farewell!\r\nThe day frowns more and more. Thou’rt like to have\r\nA lullaby too rough. I never saw\r\nThe heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!\r\nWell may I get aboard! This is the chase:\r\nI am gone for ever.\r\n\r\n [_Exit, pursued by a bear._]\r\n\r\n Enter an old Shepherd.\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nI would there were no age between ten and three-and-twenty, or that\r\nyouth would sleep out the rest; for there is nothing in the between but\r\ngetting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry, stealing,\r\nfighting—Hark you now! Would any but these boiled brains of nineteen\r\nand two-and-twenty hunt this weather? They have scared away two of my\r\nbest sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find than the master: if\r\nanywhere I have them, ’tis by the sea-side, browsing of ivy. Good luck,\r\nan ’t be thy will, what have we here?\r\n\r\n [_Taking up the child._]\r\n\r\n Mercy on ’s, a bairn! A very pretty bairn! A boy or a child, I wonder?\r\n A pretty one; a very pretty one. Sure, some scape. Though I am not\r\n bookish, yet I can read waiting-gentlewoman in the scape. This has\r\n been some stair-work, some trunk-work, some behind-door-work. They\r\n were warmer that got this than the poor thing is here. I’ll take it up\r\n for pity: yet I’ll tarry till my son come; he halloed but even now.\r\n Whoa-ho-hoa!\r\n\r\n Enter Clown.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nHilloa, loa!\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nWhat, art so near? If thou’lt see a thing to talk on when thou art dead\r\nand rotten, come hither. What ail’st thou, man?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nI have seen two such sights, by sea and by land! But I am not to say it\r\nis a sea, for it is now the sky: betwixt the firmament and it, you\r\ncannot thrust a bodkin’s point.\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nWhy, boy, how is it?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nI would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages, how it takes up\r\nthe shore! But that’s not to the point. O, the most piteous cry of the\r\npoor souls! sometimes to see ’em, and not to see ’em. Now the ship\r\nboring the moon with her mainmast, and anon swallowed with yest and\r\nfroth, as you’d thrust a cork into a hogshead. And then for the land\r\nservice, to see how the bear tore out his shoulder-bone, how he cried\r\nto me for help, and said his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to\r\nmake an end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragon’d it: but\r\nfirst, how the poor souls roared, and the sea mocked them, and how the\r\npoor gentleman roared, and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder\r\nthan the sea or weather.\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nName of mercy, when was this, boy?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNow, now. I have not winked since I saw these sights: the men are not\r\nyet cold under water, nor the bear half dined on the gentleman. He’s at\r\nit now.\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nWould I had been by to have helped the old man!\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nI would you had been by the ship side, to have helped her: there your\r\ncharity would have lacked footing.\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nHeavy matters, heavy matters! But look thee here, boy. Now bless\r\nthyself: thou met’st with things dying, I with things new-born. Here’s\r\na sight for thee. Look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire’s child! Look\r\nthee here; take up, take up, boy; open’t. So, let’s see. It was told me\r\nI should be rich by the fairies. This is some changeling: open’t.\r\nWhat’s within, boy?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nYou’re a made old man. If the sins of your youth are forgiven you,\r\nyou’re well to live. Gold! all gold!\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nThis is fairy gold, boy, and ’twill prove so. Up with it, keep it\r\nclose: home, home, the next way. We are lucky, boy, and to be so still\r\nrequires nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, good boy, the next\r\nway home.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nGo you the next way with your findings. I’ll go see if the bear be gone\r\nfrom the gentleman, and how much he hath eaten. They are never curst\r\nbut when they are hungry: if there be any of him left, I’ll bury it.\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nThat’s a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that which is left of him\r\nwhat he is, fetch me to th’ sight of him.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nMarry, will I; and you shall help to put him i’ th’ ground.\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\n’Tis a lucky day, boy, and we’ll do good deeds on ’t.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\nACT IV\r\n\r\nSCENE I.\r\n\r\n Enter Time, the Chorus.\r\n\r\nTIME.\r\nI that please some, try all: both joy and terror\r\nOf good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,\r\nNow take upon me, in the name of Time,\r\nTo use my wings. Impute it not a crime\r\nTo me or my swift passage, that I slide\r\nO’er sixteen years, and leave the growth untried\r\nOf that wide gap, since it is in my power\r\nTo o’erthrow law, and in one self-born hour\r\nTo plant and o’erwhelm custom. Let me pass\r\nThe same I am, ere ancient’st order was\r\nOr what is now received. I witness to\r\nThe times that brought them in; so shall I do\r\nTo th’ freshest things now reigning, and make stale\r\nThe glistering of this present, as my tale\r\nNow seems to it. Your patience this allowing,\r\nI turn my glass, and give my scene such growing\r\nAs you had slept between. Leontes leaving\r\nTh’ effects of his fond jealousies, so grieving\r\nThat he shuts up himself, imagine me,\r\nGentle spectators, that I now may be\r\nIn fair Bohemia, and remember well,\r\nI mentioned a son o’ th’ king’s, which Florizel\r\nI now name to you; and with speed so pace\r\nTo speak of Perdita, now grown in grace\r\nEqual with wondering. What of her ensues\r\nI list not prophesy; but let Time’s news\r\nBe known when ’tis brought forth. A shepherd’s daughter,\r\nAnd what to her adheres, which follows after,\r\nIs th’ argument of Time. Of this allow,\r\nIf ever you have spent time worse ere now;\r\nIf never, yet that Time himself doth say\r\nHe wishes earnestly you never may.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. Bohemia. A Room in the palace of Polixenes.\r\n\r\n Enter Polixenes and Camillo.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nI pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate: ’tis a sickness\r\ndenying thee anything; a death to grant this.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nIt is fifteen years since I saw my country. Though I have for the most\r\npart been aired abroad, I desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the\r\npenitent king, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling sorrows I\r\nmight be some allay, or I o’erween to think so,—which is another spur\r\nto my departure.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nAs thou lov’st me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of thy services by\r\nleaving me now: the need I have of thee, thine own goodness hath made;\r\nbetter not to have had thee than thus to want thee. Thou, having made\r\nme businesses which none without thee can sufficiently manage, must\r\neither stay to execute them thyself, or take away with thee the very\r\nservices thou hast done, which if I have not enough considered (as too\r\nmuch I cannot) to be more thankful to thee shall be my study; and my\r\nprofit therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal country Sicilia,\r\nprithee speak no more; whose very naming punishes me with the\r\nremembrance of that penitent, as thou call’st him, and reconciled king,\r\nmy brother; whose loss of his most precious queen and children are even\r\nnow to be afresh lamented. Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince\r\nFlorizel, my son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not being\r\ngracious, than they are in losing them when they have approved their\r\nvirtues.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nSir, it is three days since I saw the prince. What his happier affairs\r\nmay be, are to me unknown, but I have missingly noted he is of late\r\nmuch retired from court, and is less frequent to his princely exercises\r\nthan formerly he hath appeared.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nI have considered so much, Camillo, and with some care; so far that I\r\nhave eyes under my service which look upon his removedness; from whom I\r\nhave this intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a most\r\nhomely shepherd, a man, they say, that from very nothing, and beyond\r\nthe imagination of his neighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nI have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a daughter of most rare\r\nnote: the report of her is extended more than can be thought to begin\r\nfrom such a cottage.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nThat’s likewise part of my intelligence: but, I fear, the angle that\r\nplucks our son thither. Thou shalt accompany us to the place, where we\r\nwill, not appearing what we are, have some question with the shepherd;\r\nfrom whose simplicity I think it not uneasy to get the cause of my\r\nson’s resort thither. Prithee, be my present partner in this business,\r\nand lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nI willingly obey your command.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nMy best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. The same. A Road near the Shepherd’s cottage.\r\n\r\n Enter Autolycus, singing.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\n_When daffodils begin to peer,\r\n With, hey! the doxy over the dale,\r\nWhy, then comes in the sweet o’ the year,\r\n For the red blood reigns in the winter’s pale._\r\n\r\n_The white sheet bleaching on the hedge,\r\n With, hey! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!\r\nDoth set my pugging tooth on edge;\r\n For a quart of ale is a dish for a king._\r\n\r\n_The lark, that tirra-lirra chants,\r\n With, hey! with, hey! the thrush and the jay,\r\nAre summer songs for me and my aunts,\r\n While we lie tumbling in the hay._\r\n\r\nI have served Prince Florizel, and in my time wore three-pile, but now\r\nI am out of service.\r\n\r\n_But shall I go mourn for that, my dear?\r\n The pale moon shines by night:\r\nAnd when I wander here and there,\r\n I then do most go right._\r\n\r\n_If tinkers may have leave to live,\r\n And bear the sow-skin budget,\r\nThen my account I well may give\r\n And in the stocks avouch it._\r\n\r\nMy traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to lesser linen. My\r\nfather named me Autolycus; who being, I as am, littered under Mercury,\r\nwas likewise a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and drab I\r\npurchased this caparison, and my revenue is the silly cheat. Gallows\r\nand knock are too powerful on the highway. Beating and hanging are\r\nterrors to me. For the life to come, I sleep out the thought of it. A\r\nprize! a prize!\r\n\r\n Enter Clown.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nLet me see: every ’leven wether tods; every tod yields pound and odd\r\nshilling; fifteen hundred shorn, what comes the wool to?\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\n[_Aside._] If the springe hold, the cock’s mine.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nI cannot do’t without counters. Let me see; what am I to buy for our\r\nsheep-shearing feast? “Three pound of sugar, five pound of currants,\r\nrice”—what will this sister of mine do with rice? But my father hath\r\nmade her mistress of the feast, and she lays it on. She hath made me\r\nfour-and-twenty nosegays for the shearers, three-man song-men all, and\r\nvery good ones; but they are most of them means and basses, but one\r\npuritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to hornpipes. I must have\r\nsaffron to colour the warden pies; “mace; dates”, none, that’s out of\r\nmy note; “nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger”, but that I may beg;\r\n“four pound of prunes, and as many of raisins o’ th’ sun.”\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\n[_Grovelling on the ground._] O that ever I was born!\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nI’ th’ name of me!\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nO, help me, help me! Pluck but off these rags; and then, death, death!\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nAlack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay on thee, rather\r\nthan have these off.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nO sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me more than the stripes I\r\nhave received, which are mighty ones and millions.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nAlas, poor man! a million of beating may come to a great matter.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nI am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparel ta’en from me, and\r\nthese detestable things put upon me.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWhat, by a horseman or a footman?\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nA footman, sweet sir, a footman.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nIndeed, he should be a footman by the garments he has left with thee:\r\nif this be a horseman’s coat, it hath seen very hot service. Lend me\r\nthy hand, I’ll help thee: come, lend me thy hand.\r\n\r\n [_Helping him up._]\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nO, good sir, tenderly, O!\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nAlas, poor soul!\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nO, good sir, softly, good sir. I fear, sir, my shoulder blade is out.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nHow now! canst stand?\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nSoftly, dear sir! [_Picks his pocket._] good sir, softly. You ha’ done\r\nme a charitable office.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nDost lack any money? I have a little money for thee.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nNo, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir: I have a kinsman not past\r\nthree-quarters of a mile hence, unto whom I was going. I shall there\r\nhave money or anything I want. Offer me no money, I pray you; that\r\nkills my heart.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWhat manner of fellow was he that robbed you?\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nA fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with troll-my-dames. I\r\nknew him once a servant of the prince; I cannot tell, good sir, for\r\nwhich of his virtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nHis vices, you would say; there’s no virtue whipped out of the court.\r\nThey cherish it to make it stay there; and yet it will no more but\r\nabide.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nVices, I would say, sir. I know this man well. He hath been since an\r\nape-bearer, then a process-server, a bailiff. Then he compassed a\r\nmotion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker’s wife within a mile\r\nwhere my land and living lies; and, having flown over many knavish\r\nprofessions, he settled only in rogue. Some call him Autolycus.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nOut upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he haunts wakes, fairs, and\r\nbear-baitings.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nVery true, sir; he, sir, he; that’s the rogue that put me into this\r\napparel.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNot a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia. If you had but looked big and\r\nspit at him, he’d have run.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nI must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter. I am false of heart that\r\nway; and that he knew, I warrant him.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nHow do you now?\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nSweet sir, much better than I was. I can stand and walk: I will even\r\ntake my leave of you and pace softly towards my kinsman’s.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nShall I bring thee on the way?\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nNo, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nThen fare thee well. I must go buy spices for our sheep-shearing.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nProsper you, sweet sir!\r\n\r\n [_Exit Clown._]\r\n\r\n Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice. I’ll be with you\r\n at your sheep-shearing too. If I make not this cheat bring out\r\n another, and the shearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled, and my name\r\n put in the book of virtue!\r\n[_Sings._]\r\n_Jog on, jog on, the footpath way,\r\n And merrily hent the stile-a:\r\nA merry heart goes all the day,\r\n Your sad tires in a mile-a._\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV. The same. A Shepherd’s Cottage.\r\n\r\n Enter Florizel and Perdita.\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nThese your unusual weeds to each part of you\r\nDo give a life, no shepherdess, but Flora\r\nPeering in April’s front. This your sheep-shearing\r\nIs as a meeting of the petty gods,\r\nAnd you the queen on ’t.\r\n\r\nPERDITA.\r\nSir, my gracious lord,\r\nTo chide at your extremes it not becomes me;\r\nO, pardon that I name them! Your high self,\r\nThe gracious mark o’ th’ land, you have obscur’d\r\nWith a swain’s wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,\r\nMost goddess-like prank’d up. But that our feasts\r\nIn every mess have folly, and the feeders\r\nDigest it with a custom, I should blush\r\nTo see you so attir’d; swoon, I think,\r\nTo show myself a glass.\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nI bless the time\r\nWhen my good falcon made her flight across\r\nThy father’s ground.\r\n\r\nPERDITA.\r\nNow Jove afford you cause!\r\nTo me the difference forges dread. Your greatness\r\nHath not been us’d to fear. Even now I tremble\r\nTo think your father, by some accident,\r\nShould pass this way, as you did. O, the Fates!\r\nHow would he look to see his work, so noble,\r\nVilely bound up? What would he say? Or how\r\nShould I, in these my borrow’d flaunts, behold\r\nThe sternness of his presence?\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nApprehend\r\nNothing but jollity. The gods themselves,\r\nHumbling their deities to love, have taken\r\nThe shapes of beasts upon them. Jupiter\r\nBecame a bull and bellow’d; the green Neptune\r\nA ram and bleated; and the fire-rob’d god,\r\nGolden Apollo, a poor humble swain,\r\nAs I seem now. Their transformations\r\nWere never for a piece of beauty rarer,\r\nNor in a way so chaste, since my desires\r\nRun not before mine honour, nor my lusts\r\nBurn hotter than my faith.\r\n\r\nPERDITA.\r\nO, but, sir,\r\nYour resolution cannot hold when ’tis\r\nOppos’d, as it must be, by the power of the king:\r\nOne of these two must be necessities,\r\nWhich then will speak, that you must change this purpose,\r\nOr I my life.\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nThou dearest Perdita,\r\nWith these forc’d thoughts, I prithee, darken not\r\nThe mirth o’ th’ feast. Or I’ll be thine, my fair,\r\nOr not my father’s. For I cannot be\r\nMine own, nor anything to any, if\r\nI be not thine. To this I am most constant,\r\nThough destiny say no. Be merry, gentle.\r\nStrangle such thoughts as these with anything\r\nThat you behold the while. Your guests are coming:\r\nLift up your countenance, as it were the day\r\nOf celebration of that nuptial which\r\nWe two have sworn shall come.\r\n\r\nPERDITA.\r\nO lady Fortune,\r\nStand you auspicious!\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nSee, your guests approach:\r\nAddress yourself to entertain them sprightly,\r\nAnd let’s be red with mirth.\r\n\r\n Enter Shepherd with Polixenes and Camillo, disguised; Clown, Mopsa,\r\n Dorcas with others.\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nFie, daughter! When my old wife liv’d, upon\r\nThis day she was both pantler, butler, cook,\r\nBoth dame and servant; welcom’d all; serv’d all;\r\nWould sing her song and dance her turn; now here\r\nAt upper end o’ th’ table, now i’ th’ middle;\r\nOn his shoulder, and his; her face o’ fire\r\nWith labour, and the thing she took to quench it\r\nShe would to each one sip. You are retired,\r\nAs if you were a feasted one, and not\r\nThe hostess of the meeting: pray you, bid\r\nThese unknown friends to ’s welcome, for it is\r\nA way to make us better friends, more known.\r\nCome, quench your blushes, and present yourself\r\nThat which you are, mistress o’ th’ feast. Come on,\r\nAnd bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,\r\nAs your good flock shall prosper.\r\n\r\nPERDITA.\r\n[_To Polixenes._] Sir, welcome.\r\nIt is my father’s will I should take on me\r\nThe hostess-ship o’ the day.\r\n[_To Camillo._] You’re welcome, sir.\r\nGive me those flowers there, Dorcas. Reverend sirs,\r\nFor you there’s rosemary and rue; these keep\r\nSeeming and savour all the winter long.\r\nGrace and remembrance be to you both!\r\nAnd welcome to our shearing!\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nShepherdess—\r\nA fair one are you—well you fit our ages\r\nWith flowers of winter.\r\n\r\nPERDITA.\r\nSir, the year growing ancient,\r\nNot yet on summer’s death nor on the birth\r\nOf trembling winter, the fairest flowers o’ th’ season\r\nAre our carnations and streak’d gillyvors,\r\nWhich some call nature’s bastards: of that kind\r\nOur rustic garden’s barren; and I care not\r\nTo get slips of them.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nWherefore, gentle maiden,\r\nDo you neglect them?\r\n\r\nPERDITA.\r\nFor I have heard it said\r\nThere is an art which, in their piedness, shares\r\nWith great creating nature.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nSay there be;\r\nYet nature is made better by no mean\r\nBut nature makes that mean. So, over that art\r\nWhich you say adds to nature, is an art\r\nThat nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry\r\nA gentler scion to the wildest stock,\r\nAnd make conceive a bark of baser kind\r\nBy bud of nobler race. This is an art\r\nWhich does mend nature, change it rather, but\r\nThe art itself is nature.\r\n\r\nPERDITA.\r\nSo it is.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nThen make your garden rich in gillyvors,\r\nAnd do not call them bastards.\r\n\r\nPERDITA.\r\nI’ll not put\r\nThe dibble in earth to set one slip of them;\r\nNo more than, were I painted, I would wish\r\nThis youth should say ’twere well, and only therefore\r\nDesire to breed by me. Here’s flowers for you:\r\nHot lavender, mints, savory, marjoram,\r\nThe marigold, that goes to bed with th’ sun\r\nAnd with him rises weeping. These are flowers\r\nOf middle summer, and I think they are given\r\nTo men of middle age. You’re very welcome.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nI should leave grazing, were I of your flock,\r\nAnd only live by gazing.\r\n\r\nPERDITA.\r\nOut, alas!\r\nYou’d be so lean that blasts of January\r\nWould blow you through and through. [_To Florizel_] Now, my fair’st\r\nfriend,\r\nI would I had some flowers o’ th’ spring, that might\r\nBecome your time of day; and yours, and yours,\r\nThat wear upon your virgin branches yet\r\nYour maidenheads growing. O Proserpina,\r\nFrom the flowers now that, frighted, thou let’st fall\r\nFrom Dis’s waggon! daffodils,\r\nThat come before the swallow dares, and take\r\nThe winds of March with beauty; violets dim,\r\nBut sweeter than the lids of Juno’s eyes\r\nOr Cytherea’s breath; pale primroses,\r\nThat die unmarried ere they can behold\r\nBright Phoebus in his strength (a malady\r\nMost incident to maids); bold oxlips and\r\nThe crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,\r\nThe flower-de-luce being one. O, these I lack,\r\nTo make you garlands of; and my sweet friend,\r\nTo strew him o’er and o’er!\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nWhat, like a corse?\r\n\r\nPERDITA.\r\nNo, like a bank for love to lie and play on;\r\nNot like a corse; or if, not to be buried,\r\nBut quick, and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers.\r\nMethinks I play as I have seen them do\r\nIn Whitsun pastorals. Sure this robe of mine\r\nDoes change my disposition.\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nWhat you do\r\nStill betters what is done. When you speak, sweet,\r\nI’d have you do it ever. When you sing,\r\nI’d have you buy and sell so, so give alms,\r\nPray so; and, for the ord’ring your affairs,\r\nTo sing them too. When you do dance, I wish you\r\nA wave o’ th’ sea, that you might ever do\r\nNothing but that, move still, still so,\r\nAnd own no other function. Each your doing,\r\nSo singular in each particular,\r\nCrowns what you are doing in the present deeds,\r\nThat all your acts are queens.\r\n\r\nPERDITA.\r\nO Doricles,\r\nYour praises are too large. But that your youth,\r\nAnd the true blood which peeps fairly through ’t,\r\nDo plainly give you out an unstained shepherd,\r\nWith wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,\r\nYou woo’d me the false way.\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nI think you have\r\nAs little skill to fear as I have purpose\r\nTo put you to ’t. But, come; our dance, I pray.\r\nYour hand, my Perdita. So turtles pair\r\nThat never mean to part.\r\n\r\nPERDITA.\r\nI’ll swear for ’em.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nThis is the prettiest low-born lass that ever\r\nRan on the green-sward. Nothing she does or seems\r\nBut smacks of something greater than herself,\r\nToo noble for this place.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nHe tells her something\r\nThat makes her blood look out. Good sooth, she is\r\nThe queen of curds and cream.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nCome on, strike up.\r\n\r\nDORCAS.\r\nMopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlic, to mend her kissing with!\r\n\r\nMOPSA.\r\nNow, in good time!\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNot a word, a word; we stand upon our manners.\r\nCome, strike up.\r\n\r\n [_Music. Here a dance Of Shepherds and Shepherdesses._]\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nPray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this\r\nWhich dances with your daughter?\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nThey call him Doricles; and boasts himself\r\nTo have a worthy feeding. But I have it\r\nUpon his own report, and I believe it.\r\nHe looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter.\r\nI think so too; for never gaz’d the moon\r\nUpon the water as he’ll stand and read,\r\nAs ’twere, my daughter’s eyes. And, to be plain,\r\nI think there is not half a kiss to choose\r\nWho loves another best.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nShe dances featly.\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nSo she does anything, though I report it\r\nThat should be silent. If young Doricles\r\nDo light upon her, she shall bring him that\r\nWhich he not dreams of.\r\n\r\n Enter a Servant.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nO master, if you did but hear the pedlar at the door, you would never\r\ndance again after a tabor and pipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you.\r\nHe sings several tunes faster than you’ll tell money. He utters them as\r\nhe had eaten ballads, and all men’s ears grew to his tunes.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nHe could never come better: he shall come in. I love a ballad but even\r\ntoo well, if it be doleful matter merrily set down, or a very pleasant\r\nthing indeed and sung lamentably.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nHe hath songs for man or woman of all sizes. No milliner can so fit his\r\ncustomers with gloves. He has the prettiest love-songs for maids, so\r\nwithout bawdry, which is strange; with such delicate burdens of dildos\r\nand fadings, “jump her and thump her”; and where some stretch-mouthed\r\nrascal would, as it were, mean mischief and break a foul gap into the\r\nmatter, he makes the maid to answer “Whoop, do me no harm, good man”;\r\nputs him off, slights him, with “Whoop, do me no harm, good man.”\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nThis is a brave fellow.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nBelieve me, thou talkest of an admirable conceited fellow. Has he any\r\nunbraided wares?\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nHe hath ribbons of all the colours i’ th’ rainbow; points, more than\r\nall the lawyers in Bohemia can learnedly handle, though they come to\r\nhim by th’ gross; inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns; why he sings ’em\r\nover as they were gods or goddesses; you would think a smock were a\r\nshe-angel, he so chants to the sleeve-hand and the work about the\r\nsquare on ’t.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nPrithee bring him in; and let him approach singing.\r\n\r\nPERDITA.\r\nForewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in ’s tunes.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Servant._]\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nYou have of these pedlars that have more in them than you’d think,\r\nsister.\r\n\r\nPERDITA.\r\nAy, good brother, or go about to think.\r\n\r\n Enter Autolycus, singing.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\n_Lawn as white as driven snow,\r\nCypress black as e’er was crow,\r\nGloves as sweet as damask roses,\r\nMasks for faces and for noses,\r\nBugle-bracelet, necklace amber,\r\nPerfume for a lady’s chamber,\r\nGolden quoifs and stomachers\r\nFor my lads to give their dears,\r\nPins and poking-sticks of steel,\r\nWhat maids lack from head to heel.\r\nCome buy of me, come; come buy, come buy;\r\nBuy, lads, or else your lasses cry.\r\nCome, buy._\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nIf I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst take no money of me;\r\nbut being enthralled as I am, it will also be the bondage of certain\r\nribbons and gloves.\r\n\r\nMOPSA.\r\nI was promised them against the feast; but they come not too late now.\r\n\r\nDORCAS.\r\nHe hath promised you more than that, or there be liars.\r\n\r\nMOPSA.\r\nHe hath paid you all he promised you. Maybe he has paid you more, which\r\nwill shame you to give him again.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nIs there no manners left among maids? Will they wear their plackets\r\nwhere they should bear their faces? Is there not milking-time, when you\r\nare going to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle of these secrets, but you\r\nmust be tittle-tattling before all our guests? ’Tis well they are\r\nwhispering. Clamour your tongues, and not a word more.\r\n\r\nMOPSA.\r\nI have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry lace and a pair of sweet\r\ngloves.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nHave I not told thee how I was cozened by the way and lost all my\r\nmoney?\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nAnd indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad; therefore it behoves men to\r\nbe wary.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nFear not thou, man. Thou shalt lose nothing here.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nI hope so, sir; for I have about me many parcels of charge.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWhat hast here? Ballads?\r\n\r\nMOPSA.\r\nPray now, buy some. I love a ballad in print alife, for then we are\r\nsure they are true.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nHere’s one to a very doleful tune. How a usurer’s wife was brought to\r\nbed of twenty money-bags at a burden, and how she longed to eat adders’\r\nheads and toads carbonadoed.\r\n\r\nMOPSA.\r\nIs it true, think you?\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nVery true, and but a month old.\r\n\r\nDORCAS.\r\nBless me from marrying a usurer!\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nHere’s the midwife’s name to’t, one Mistress Taleporter, and five or\r\nsix honest wives that were present. Why should I carry lies abroad?\r\n\r\nMOPSA.\r\nPray you now, buy it.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nCome on, lay it by; and let’s first see more ballads. We’ll buy the\r\nother things anon.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nHere’s another ballad, of a fish that appeared upon the coast on\r\nWednesday the fourscore of April, forty thousand fathom above water,\r\nand sung this ballad against the hard hearts of maids. It was thought\r\nshe was a woman, and was turned into a cold fish for she would not\r\nexchange flesh with one that loved her. The ballad is very pitiful, and\r\nas true.\r\n\r\nDORCAS.\r\nIs it true too, think you?\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nFive justices’ hands at it, and witnesses more than my pack will hold.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nLay it by too: another.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nThis is a merry ballad; but a very pretty one.\r\n\r\nMOPSA.\r\nLet’s have some merry ones.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nWhy, this is a passing merry one and goes to the tune of “Two maids\r\nwooing a man.” There’s scarce a maid westward but she sings it. ’Tis in\r\nrequest, I can tell you.\r\n\r\nMOPSA.\r\nWe can both sing it: if thou’lt bear a part, thou shalt hear; ’tis in\r\nthree parts.\r\n\r\nDORCAS.\r\nWe had the tune on ’t a month ago.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nI can bear my part; you must know ’tis my occupation: have at it with\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nSONG.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\n_Get you hence, for I must go\r\nWhere it fits not you to know._\r\n\r\nDORCAS.\r\n_Whither?_\r\n\r\nMOPSA.\r\n_O, whither?_\r\n\r\nDORCAS.\r\n_Whither?_\r\n\r\nMOPSA.\r\n_It becomes thy oath full well\r\nThou to me thy secrets tell._\r\n\r\nDORCAS.\r\n_Me too!

Say, whither?_\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWe’ll have this song out anon by ourselves. My father and the gentlemen\r\nare in sad talk, and we’ll not trouble them. Come, bring away thy pack\r\nafter me. Wenches, I’ll buy for you both. Pedlar, let’s have the first\r\nchoice. Follow me, girls.\r\n\r\n [_Exit with Dorcas and Mopsa._]\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\n[_Aside._] And you shall pay well for ’em.\r\n\r\nSONG.\r\n\n _Will you buy any tape,\r\n Or lace for your cape,\r\nMy dainty duck, my dear-a?\r\n Any silk, any thread,\r\n Any toys for your head,\r\nOf the new’st and fin’st, fin’st wear-a?\r\n Come to the pedlar;\r\n Money’s a meddler\r\nThat doth utter all men’s ware-a._\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\n Enter Servant.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nMaster, there is three carters, three shepherds, three neat-herds,\r\nthree swine-herds, that have made themselves all men of hair. They call\r\nthemselves saltiers, and they have dance which the wenches say is a\r\ngallimaufry of gambols, because they are not in ’t; but they themselves\r\nare o’ the mind (if it be not too rough for some that know little but\r\nbowling) it will please plentifully.\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nAway! we’ll none on ’t. Here has been too much homely foolery already.\r\nI know, sir, we weary you.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nYou weary those that refresh us: pray, let’s see these four threes of\r\nherdsmen.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nOne three of them, by their own report, sir, hath danced before the\r\nking; and not the worst of the three but jumps twelve foot and a half\r\nby th’ square.\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nLeave your prating: since these good men are pleased, let them come in;\r\nbut quickly now.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nWhy, they stay at door, sir.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\n Enter Twelve Rustics, habited like Satyrs.

[_To Florizel._] How now, fair shepherd!\r\nYour heart is full of something that does take\r\nYour mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young\r\nAnd handed love, as you do, I was wont\r\nTo load my she with knacks: I would have ransack’d\r\nThe pedlar’s silken treasury and have pour’d it\r\nTo her acceptance. You have let him go,\r\nAnd nothing marted with him. If your lass\r\nInterpretation should abuse, and call this\r\nYour lack of love or bounty, you were straited\r\nFor a reply, at least if you make a care\r\nOf happy holding her.\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nOld sir, I know\r\nShe prizes not such trifles as these are:\r\nThe gifts she looks from me are pack’d and lock’d\r\nUp in my heart, which I have given already,\r\nBut not deliver’d. O, hear me breathe my life\r\nBefore this ancient sir, who, it should seem,\r\nHath sometime lov’d. I take thy hand! this hand,\r\nAs soft as dove’s down and as white as it,\r\nOr Ethiopian’s tooth, or the fann’d snow that’s bolted\r\nBy th’ northern blasts twice o’er.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nWhat follows this?\r\nHow prettily the young swain seems to wash\r\nThe hand was fair before! I have put you out.\r\nBut to your protestation. Let me hear\r\nWhat you profess.\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nDo, and be witness to ’t.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nAnd this my neighbour, too?\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nAnd he, and more\r\nThan he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all:\r\nThat were I crown’d the most imperial monarch,\r\nThereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth\r\nThat ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge\r\nMore than was ever man’s, I would not prize them\r\nWithout her love; for her employ them all;\r\nCommend them and condemn them to her service,\r\nOr to their own perdition.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nFairly offer’d.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nThis shows a sound affection.\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nBut my daughter,\r\nSay you the like to him?\r\n\r\nPERDITA.\r\nI cannot speak\r\nSo well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better:\r\nBy th’ pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out\r\nThe purity of his.\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nTake hands, a bargain!\r\nAnd, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to’t.\r\nI give my daughter to him, and will make\r\nHer portion equal his.\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nO, that must be\r\nI’ th’ virtue of your daughter: one being dead,\r\nI shall have more than you can dream of yet;\r\nEnough then for your wonder. But come on,\r\nContract us ’fore these witnesses.\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nCome, your hand;\r\nAnd, daughter, yours.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nSoft, swain, awhile, beseech you;\r\nHave you a father?\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nI have; but what of him?\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nKnows he of this?\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nHe neither does nor shall.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nMethinks a father\r\nIs at the nuptial of his son a guest\r\nThat best becomes the table. Pray you once more,\r\nIs not your father grown incapable\r\nOf reasonable affairs? is he not stupid\r\nWith age and alt’ring rheums? can he speak? hear?\r\nKnow man from man? dispute his own estate?\r\nLies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing\r\nBut what he did being childish?\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nNo, good sir;\r\nHe has his health, and ampler strength indeed\r\nThan most have of his age.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nBy my white beard,\r\nYou offer him, if this be so, a wrong\r\nSomething unfilial: reason my son\r\nShould choose himself a wife, but as good reason\r\nThe father, all whose joy is nothing else\r\nBut fair posterity, should hold some counsel\r\nIn such a business.\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nI yield all this;\r\nBut for some other reasons, my grave sir,\r\nWhich ’tis not fit you know, I not acquaint\r\nMy father of this business.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nLet him know ’t.\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nHe shall not.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nPrithee let him.\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nNo, he must not.\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nLet him, my son: he shall not need to grieve\r\nAt knowing of thy choice.\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nCome, come, he must not.\r\nMark our contract.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\n[_Discovering himself._] Mark your divorce, young sir,\r\nWhom son I dare not call; thou art too base\r\nTo be acknowledged: thou a sceptre’s heir,\r\nThat thus affects a sheep-hook! Thou, old traitor,\r\nI am sorry that, by hanging thee, I can\r\nBut shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh piece\r\nOf excellent witchcraft, whom of force must know\r\nThe royal fool thou cop’st with,—\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nO, my heart!\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nI’ll have thy beauty scratch’d with briers and made\r\nMore homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy,\r\nIf I may ever know thou dost but sigh\r\nThat thou no more shalt see this knack (as never\r\nI mean thou shalt), we’ll bar thee from succession;\r\nNot hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,\r\nFar than Deucalion off. Mark thou my words.\r\nFollow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time,\r\nThough full of our displeasure, yet we free thee\r\nFrom the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment,\r\nWorthy enough a herdsman; yea, him too\r\nThat makes himself, but for our honour therein,\r\nUnworthy thee. If ever henceforth thou\r\nThese rural latches to his entrance open,\r\nOr hoop his body more with thy embraces,\r\nI will devise a death as cruel for thee\r\nAs thou art tender to ’t.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nPERDITA.\r\nEven here undone.\r\nI was not much afeard, for once or twice\r\nI was about to speak, and tell him plainly\r\nThe selfsame sun that shines upon his court\r\nHides not his visage from our cottage, but\r\nLooks on alike. [_To Florizel._] Will’t please you, sir, be gone?\r\nI told you what would come of this. Beseech you,\r\nOf your own state take care. This dream of mine—\r\nBeing now awake, I’ll queen it no inch farther,\r\nBut milk my ewes, and weep.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nWhy, how now, father!\r\nSpeak ere thou diest.\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nI cannot speak, nor think,\r\nNor dare to know that which I know. O sir,\r\nYou have undone a man of fourscore three,\r\nThat thought to fill his grave in quiet; yea,\r\nTo die upon the bed my father died,\r\nTo lie close by his honest bones; but now\r\nSome hangman must put on my shroud and lay me\r\nWhere no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch,\r\nThat knew’st this was the prince, and wouldst adventure\r\nTo mingle faith with him! Undone, undone!\r\nIf I might die within this hour, I have liv’d\r\nTo die when I desire.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nWhy look you so upon me?\r\nI am but sorry, not afeard; delay’d,\r\nBut nothing alt’red: what I was, I am:\r\nMore straining on for plucking back; not following\r\nMy leash unwillingly.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nGracious my lord,\r\nYou know your father’s temper: at this time\r\nHe will allow no speech (which I do guess\r\nYou do not purpose to him) and as hardly\r\nWill he endure your sight as yet, I fear:\r\nThen, till the fury of his highness settle,\r\nCome not before him.\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nI not purpose it.\r\nI think Camillo?\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nEven he, my lord.\r\n\r\nPERDITA.\r\nHow often have I told you ’twould be thus!\r\nHow often said my dignity would last\r\nBut till ’twere known!\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nIt cannot fail but by\r\nThe violation of my faith; and then\r\nLet nature crush the sides o’ th’ earth together\r\nAnd mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks.\r\nFrom my succession wipe me, father; I\r\nAm heir to my affection.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nBe advis’d.\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nI am, and by my fancy. If my reason\r\nWill thereto be obedient, I have reason;\r\nIf not, my senses, better pleas’d with madness,\r\nDo bid it welcome.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nThis is desperate, sir.\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nSo call it: but it does fulfil my vow.\r\nI needs must think it honesty. Camillo,\r\nNot for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may\r\nBe thereat glean’d; for all the sun sees or\r\nThe close earth wombs, or the profound seas hides\r\nIn unknown fathoms, will I break my oath\r\nTo this my fair belov’d. Therefore, I pray you,\r\nAs you have ever been my father’s honour’d friend,\r\nWhen he shall miss me,—as, in faith, I mean not\r\nTo see him any more,—cast your good counsels\r\nUpon his passion: let myself and fortune\r\nTug for the time to come. This you may know,\r\nAnd so deliver, I am put to sea\r\nWith her whom here I cannot hold on shore;\r\nAnd, most opportune to her need, I have\r\nA vessel rides fast by, but not prepar’d\r\nFor this design. What course I mean to hold\r\nShall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor\r\nConcern me the reporting.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nO my lord,\r\nI would your spirit were easier for advice,\r\nOr stronger for your need.\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nHark, Perdita. [_Takes her aside._]\r\n[_To Camillo._] I’ll hear you by and by.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nHe’s irremovable,\r\nResolv’d for flight. Now were I happy if\r\nHis going I could frame to serve my turn,\r\nSave him from danger, do him love and honour,\r\nPurchase the sight again of dear Sicilia\r\nAnd that unhappy king, my master, whom\r\nI so much thirst to see.\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nNow, good Camillo,\r\nI am so fraught with curious business that\r\nI leave out ceremony.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nSir, I think\r\nYou have heard of my poor services, i’ th’ love\r\nThat I have borne your father?\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nVery nobly\r\nHave you deserv’d: it is my father’s music\r\nTo speak your deeds, not little of his care\r\nTo have them recompens’d as thought on.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nWell, my lord,\r\nIf you may please to think I love the king,\r\nAnd, through him, what’s nearest to him, which is\r\nYour gracious self, embrace but my direction,\r\nIf your more ponderous and settled project\r\nMay suffer alteration. On mine honour,\r\nI’ll point you where you shall have such receiving\r\nAs shall become your highness; where you may\r\nEnjoy your mistress; from the whom, I see,\r\nThere’s no disjunction to be made, but by,\r\nAs heavens forfend, your ruin. Marry her,\r\nAnd with my best endeavours in your absence\r\nYour discontenting father strive to qualify\r\nAnd bring him up to liking.\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nHow, Camillo,\r\nMay this, almost a miracle, be done?\r\nThat I may call thee something more than man,\r\nAnd after that trust to thee.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nHave you thought on\r\nA place whereto you’ll go?\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nNot any yet.\r\nBut as th’ unthought-on accident is guilty\r\nTo what we wildly do, so we profess\r\nOurselves to be the slaves of chance, and flies\r\nOf every wind that blows.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nThen list to me:\r\nThis follows, if you will not change your purpose,\r\nBut undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,\r\nAnd there present yourself and your fair princess,\r\nFor so, I see, she must be, ’fore Leontes:\r\nShe shall be habited as it becomes\r\nThe partner of your bed. Methinks I see\r\nLeontes opening his free arms and weeping\r\nHis welcomes forth; asks thee, the son, forgiveness,\r\nAs ’twere i’ th’ father’s person; kisses the hands\r\nOf your fresh princess; o’er and o’er divides him\r\n’Twixt his unkindness and his kindness. Th’ one\r\nHe chides to hell, and bids the other grow\r\nFaster than thought or time.\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nWorthy Camillo,\r\nWhat colour for my visitation shall I\r\nHold up before him?\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nSent by the king your father\r\nTo greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,\r\nThe manner of your bearing towards him, with\r\nWhat you (as from your father) shall deliver,\r\nThings known betwixt us three, I’ll write you down,\r\nThe which shall point you forth at every sitting\r\nWhat you must say; that he shall not perceive\r\nBut that you have your father’s bosom there\r\nAnd speak his very heart.\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nI am bound to you:\r\nThere is some sap in this.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nA course more promising\r\nThan a wild dedication of yourselves\r\nTo unpath’d waters, undream’d shores, most certain\r\nTo miseries enough: no hope to help you,\r\nBut as you shake off one to take another:\r\nNothing so certain as your anchors, who\r\nDo their best office if they can but stay you\r\nWhere you’ll be loath to be. Besides, you know\r\nProsperity’s the very bond of love,\r\nWhose fresh complexion and whose heart together\r\nAffliction alters.\r\n\r\nPERDITA.\r\nOne of these is true:\r\nI think affliction may subdue the cheek,\r\nBut not take in the mind.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nYea, say you so?\r\nThere shall not at your father’s house, these seven years\r\nBe born another such.\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nMy good Camillo,\r\nShe is as forward of her breeding as\r\nShe is i’ th’ rear our birth.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nI cannot say ’tis pity\r\nShe lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress\r\nTo most that teach.\r\n\r\nPERDITA.\r\nYour pardon, sir; for this\r\nI’ll blush you thanks.\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nMy prettiest Perdita!\r\nBut, O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,\r\nPreserver of my father, now of me,\r\nThe medicine of our house, how shall we do?\r\nWe are not furnish’d like Bohemia’s son,\r\nNor shall appear in Sicilia.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nMy lord,\r\nFear none of this. I think you know my fortunes\r\nDo all lie there: it shall be so my care\r\nTo have you royally appointed as if\r\nThe scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,\r\nThat you may know you shall not want,—one word.\r\n[_They talk aside._]\r\n\r\n Enter Autolycus.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nHa, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his sworn brother, a very\r\nsimple gentleman! I have sold all my trumpery. Not a counterfeit stone,\r\nnot a ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad, knife, tape,\r\nglove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring, to keep my pack from fasting.\r\nThey throng who should buy first, as if my trinkets had been hallowed\r\nand brought a benediction to the buyer: by which means I saw whose\r\npurse was best in picture; and what I saw, to my good use I remembered.\r\nMy clown (who wants but something to be a reasonable man) grew so in\r\nlove with the wenches’ song that he would not stir his pettitoes till\r\nhe had both tune and words; which so drew the rest of the herd to me\r\nthat all their other senses stuck in ears: you might have pinched a\r\nplacket, it was senseless; ’twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a purse;\r\nI would have filed keys off that hung in chains: no hearing, no\r\nfeeling, but my sir’s song, and admiring the nothing of it. So that in\r\nthis time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their festival purses;\r\nand had not the old man come in with a whoobub against his daughter and\r\nthe king’s son, and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not left a\r\npurse alive in the whole army.\r\n\r\n Camillo, Florizel and Perdita come forward.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nNay, but my letters, by this means being there\r\nSo soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nAnd those that you’ll procure from king Leontes?\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nShall satisfy your father.\r\n\r\nPERDITA.\r\nHappy be you!\r\nAll that you speak shows fair.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\n[_Seeing Autolycus._] Who have we here?\r\nWe’ll make an instrument of this; omit\r\nNothing may give us aid.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\n[_Aside._] If they have overheard me now,—why, hanging.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nHow now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fear not, man; here’s no\r\nharm intended to thee.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nI am a poor fellow, sir.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nWhy, be so still; here’s nobody will steal that from thee: yet, for the\r\noutside of thy poverty we must make an exchange; therefore discase thee\r\ninstantly,—thou must think there’s a necessity in’t—and change garments\r\nwith this gentleman: though the pennyworth on his side be the worst,\r\nyet hold thee, there’s some boot.\r\n\r\n [_Giving money._]\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nI am a poor fellow, sir: [_Aside._] I know ye well enough.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nNay, prithee dispatch: the gentleman is half flayed already.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nAre you in earnest, sir? [_Aside._] I smell the trick on’t.\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nDispatch, I prithee.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nIndeed, I have had earnest; but I cannot with conscience take it.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nUnbuckle, unbuckle.\r\n\r\n [_Florizel and Autolycus exchange garments._]\r\n\r\nFortunate mistress,—let my prophecy\r\nCome home to you!—you must retire yourself\r\nInto some covert. Take your sweetheart’s hat\r\nAnd pluck it o’er your brows, muffle your face,\r\nDismantle you; and, as you can, disliken\r\nThe truth of your own seeming; that you may\r\n(For I do fear eyes over) to shipboard\r\nGet undescried.\r\n\r\nPERDITA.\r\nI see the play so lies\r\nThat I must bear a part.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nNo remedy.\r\nHave you done there?\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nShould I now meet my father,\r\nHe would not call me son.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nNay, you shall have no hat.

To have an open ear, a quick eye,\r\nand a nimble hand, is necessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is\r\nrequisite also, to smell out work for the other senses. I see this is\r\nthe time that the unjust man doth thrive. What an exchange had this\r\nbeen without boot! What a boot is here with this exchange! Sure the\r\ngods do this year connive at us, and we may do anything extempore. The\r\nprince himself is about a piece of iniquity, stealing away from his\r\nfather with his clog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece of\r\nhonesty to acquaint the king withal, I would not do’t: I hold it the\r\nmore knavery to conceal it; and therein am I constant to my profession.\r\n\r\n Enter Clown and Shepherd.\r\n\r\nAside, aside; here is more matter for a hot brain: every lane’s end,\r\nevery shop, church, session, hanging, yields a careful man work.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nSee, see; what a man you are now! There is no other way but to tell the\r\nking she’s a changeling, and none of your flesh and blood.\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nNay, but hear me.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNay, but hear me.\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nGo to, then.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nShe being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh and blood has not\r\noffended the king; and so your flesh and blood is not to be punished by\r\nhim. Show those things you found about her, those secret things, all\r\nbut what she has with her: this being done, let the law go whistle, I\r\nwarrant you.\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nI will tell the king all, every word, yea, and his son’s pranks too;\r\nwho, I may say, is no honest man neither to his father nor to me, to go\r\nabout to make me the king’s brother-in-law.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nIndeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you could have been to him,\r\nand then your blood had been the dearer by I know how much an ounce.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\n[_Aside._] Very wisely, puppies!\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nWell, let us to the king: there is that in this fardel will make him\r\nscratch his beard.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\n[_Aside._] I know not what impediment this complaint may be to the\r\nflight of my master.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nPray heartily he be at’ palace.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\n[_Aside._] Though I am not naturally honest, I am so sometimes by\r\nchance. Let me pocket up my pedlar’s excrement. [_Takes off his false\r\nbeard._] How now, rustics! whither are you bound?\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nTo the palace, an it like your worship.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nYour affairs there, what, with whom, the condition of that fardel, the\r\nplace of your dwelling, your names, your ages, of what having,\r\nbreeding, and anything that is fitting to be known? discover!\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWe are but plain fellows, sir.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nA lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have no lying. It becomes none\r\nbut tradesmen, and they often give us soldiers the lie; but we pay them\r\nfor it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; therefore they do not\r\ngive us the lie.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nYour worship had like to have given us one, if you had not taken\r\nyourself with the manner.\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nAre you a courtier, an ’t like you, sir?\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nWhether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest thou not the air of\r\nthe court in these enfoldings? hath not my gait in it the measure of\r\nthe court? receives not thy nose court-odour from me? reflect I not on\r\nthy baseness court-contempt? Think’st thou, for that I insinuate, or\r\ntoaze from thee thy business, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtier\r\n_cap-a-pe_, and one that will either push on or pluck back thy business\r\nthere. Whereupon I command thee to open thy affair.\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nMy business, sir, is to the king.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nWhat advocate hast thou to him?\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nI know not, an ’t like you.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nAdvocate’s the court-word for a pheasant. Say you have none.\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nNone, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nHow bless’d are we that are not simple men!\r\nYet nature might have made me as these are,\r\nTherefore I will not disdain.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nThis cannot be but a great courtier.\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nHis garments are rich, but he wears them not handsomely.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nHe seems to be the more noble in being fantastical: a great man, I’ll\r\nwarrant; I know by the picking on’s teeth.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nThe fardel there? What’s i’ th’ fardel? Wherefore that box?\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nSir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box which none must\r\nknow but the king; and which he shall know within this hour, if I may\r\ncome to th’ speech of him.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nAge, thou hast lost thy labour.\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nWhy, sir?\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nThe king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a new ship to purge\r\nmelancholy and air himself: for, if thou beest capable of things\r\nserious, thou must know the king is full of grief.\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nSo ’tis said, sir; about his son, that should have married a shepherd’s\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nIf that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly. The curses he shall\r\nhave, the tortures he shall feel, will break the back of man, the heart\r\nof monster.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nThink you so, sir?\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nNot he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy and vengeance bitter;\r\nbut those that are germane to him, though removed fifty times, shall\r\nall come under the hangman: which, though it be great pity, yet it is\r\nnecessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue, a ram-tender, to offer to have\r\nhis daughter come into grace! Some say he shall be stoned; but that\r\ndeath is too soft for him, say I. Draw our throne into a sheepcote! All\r\ndeaths are too few, the sharpest too easy.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nHas the old man e’er a son, sir, do you hear, an ’t like you, sir?\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nHe has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then ’nointed over with honey,\r\nset on the head of a wasp’s nest; then stand till he be three quarters\r\nand a dram dead; then recovered again with aqua-vitæ or some other hot\r\ninfusion; then, raw as he is, and in the hottest day prognostication\r\nproclaims, shall he be set against a brick wall, the sun looking with a\r\nsouthward eye upon him, where he is to behold him with flies blown to\r\ndeath. But what talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries are\r\nto be smiled at, their offences being so capital? Tell me (for you seem\r\nto be honest plain men) what you have to the king. Being something\r\ngently considered, I’ll bring you where he is aboard, tender your\r\npersons to his presence, whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in\r\nman besides the king to effect your suits, here is man shall do it.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nHe seems to be of great authority: close with him, give him gold; and\r\nthough authority be a stubborn bear, yet he is oft led by the nose with\r\ngold: show the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand, and no\r\nmore ado. Remember: “ston’d” and “flayed alive”.\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nAn ’t please you, sir, to undertake the business for us, here is that\r\ngold I have. I’ll make it as much more, and leave this young man in\r\npawn till I bring it you.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nAfter I have done what I promised?\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nAy, sir.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nWell, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nIn some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitiful one, I hope I shall\r\nnot be flayed out of it.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nO, that’s the case of the shepherd’s son. Hang him, he’ll be made an\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nComfort, good comfort! We must to the king and show our strange sights.\r\nHe must know ’tis none of your daughter nor my sister; we are gone\r\nelse. Sir, I will give you as much as this old man does when the\r\nbusiness is performed, and remain, as he says, your pawn till it be\r\nbrought you.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nI will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side; go on the\r\nright-hand. I will but look upon the hedge, and follow you.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWe are blessed in this man, as I may say, even blessed.\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nLet’s before, as he bids us. He was provided to do us good.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Shepherd and Clown._]\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nIf I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would not suffer me: she\r\ndrops booties in my mouth. I am courted now with a double occasion:\r\ngold, and a means to do the prince my master good; which who knows how\r\nthat may turn back to my advancement? I will bring these two moles,\r\nthese blind ones, aboard him. If he think it fit to shore them again\r\nand that the complaint they have to the king concerns him nothing, let\r\nhim call me rogue for being so far officious; for I am proof against\r\nthat title and what shame else belongs to ’t. To him will I present\r\nthem. There may be matter in it.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\nACT V\r\n\r\nSCENE I. Sicilia. A Room in the palace of Leontes.\r\n\r\n Enter Leontes, Cleomenes, Dion, Paulina and others.\r\n\r\nCLEOMENES\r\nSir, you have done enough, and have perform’d\r\nA saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make\r\nWhich you have not redeem’d; indeed, paid down\r\nMore penitence than done trespass: at the last,\r\nDo as the heavens have done, forget your evil;\r\nWith them, forgive yourself.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nWhilst I remember\r\nHer and her virtues, I cannot forget\r\nMy blemishes in them; and so still think of\r\nThe wrong I did myself: which was so much\r\nThat heirless it hath made my kingdom, and\r\nDestroy’d the sweet’st companion that e’er man\r\nBred his hopes out of.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nTrue, too true, my lord.\r\nIf, one by one, you wedded all the world,\r\nOr from the all that are took something good,\r\nTo make a perfect woman, she you kill’d\r\nWould be unparallel’d.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nI think so. Kill’d!\r\nShe I kill’d! I did so: but thou strik’st me\r\nSorely, to say I did: it is as bitter\r\nUpon thy tongue as in my thought. Now, good now,\r\nSay so but seldom.\r\n\r\nCLEOMENES\r\nNot at all, good lady.\r\nYou might have spoken a thousand things that would\r\nHave done the time more benefit and grac’d\r\nYour kindness better.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nYou are one of those\r\nWould have him wed again.\r\n\r\nDION.\r\nIf you would not so,\r\nYou pity not the state, nor the remembrance\r\nOf his most sovereign name; consider little\r\nWhat dangers, by his highness’ fail of issue,\r\nMay drop upon his kingdom, and devour\r\nIncertain lookers-on. What were more holy\r\nThan to rejoice the former queen is well?\r\nWhat holier than, for royalty’s repair,\r\nFor present comfort, and for future good,\r\nTo bless the bed of majesty again\r\nWith a sweet fellow to ’t?\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nThere is none worthy,\r\nRespecting her that’s gone. Besides, the gods\r\nWill have fulfill’d their secret purposes;\r\nFor has not the divine Apollo said,\r\nIs ’t not the tenor of his oracle,\r\nThat king Leontes shall not have an heir\r\nTill his lost child be found? Which that it shall,\r\nIs all as monstrous to our human reason\r\nAs my Antigonus to break his grave\r\nAnd come again to me; who, on my life,\r\nDid perish with the infant. ’Tis your counsel\r\nMy lord should to the heavens be contrary,\r\nOppose against their wills. [_To Leontes._] Care not for issue;\r\nThe crown will find an heir. Great Alexander\r\nLeft his to th’ worthiest; so his successor\r\nWas like to be the best.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nGood Paulina,\r\nWho hast the memory of Hermione,\r\nI know, in honour, O that ever I\r\nHad squar’d me to thy counsel! Then, even now,\r\nI might have look’d upon my queen’s full eyes,\r\nHave taken treasure from her lips,—\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nAnd left them\r\nMore rich for what they yielded.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nThou speak’st truth.\r\nNo more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,\r\nAnd better us’d, would make her sainted spirit\r\nAgain possess her corpse, and on this stage,\r\n(Where we offenders now appear) soul-vexed,\r\nAnd begin “Why to me?”\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nHad she such power,\r\nShe had just cause.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nShe had; and would incense me\r\nTo murder her I married.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nI should so.\r\nWere I the ghost that walk’d, I’d bid you mark\r\nHer eye, and tell me for what dull part in ’t\r\nYou chose her: then I’d shriek, that even your ears\r\nShould rift to hear me; and the words that follow’d\r\nShould be “Remember mine.”\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nStars, stars,\r\nAnd all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;\r\nI’ll have no wife, Paulina.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nWill you swear\r\nNever to marry but by my free leave?\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nNever, Paulina; so be bless’d my spirit!\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nThen, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.\r\n\r\nCLEOMENES\r\nYou tempt him over-much.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nUnless another,\r\nAs like Hermione as is her picture,\r\nAffront his eye.\r\n\r\nCLEOMENES\r\nGood madam,—\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nI have done.\r\nYet, if my lord will marry,—if you will, sir,\r\nNo remedy but you will,—give me the office\r\nTo choose you a queen: she shall not be so young\r\nAs was your former, but she shall be such\r\nAs, walk’d your first queen’s ghost, it should take joy\r\nTo see her in your arms.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nMy true Paulina,\r\nWe shall not marry till thou bid’st us.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nThat\r\nShall be when your first queen’s again in breath;\r\nNever till then.\r\n\r\n Enter a Servant.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nOne that gives out himself Prince Florizel,\r\nSon of Polixenes, with his princess (she\r\nThe fairest I have yet beheld) desires access\r\nTo your high presence.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nWhat with him? he comes not\r\nLike to his father’s greatness: his approach,\r\nSo out of circumstance and sudden, tells us\r\n’Tis not a visitation fram’d, but forc’d\r\nBy need and accident. What train?\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nBut few,\r\nAnd those but mean.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nHis princess, say you, with him?\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nAy, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,\r\nThat e’er the sun shone bright on.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nO Hermione,\r\nAs every present time doth boast itself\r\nAbove a better gone, so must thy grave\r\nGive way to what’s seen now! Sir, you yourself\r\nHave said and writ so,—but your writing now\r\nIs colder than that theme,—‘She had not been,\r\nNor was not to be equall’d’; thus your verse\r\nFlow’d with her beauty once; ’tis shrewdly ebb’d,\r\nTo say you have seen a better.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nPardon, madam:\r\nThe one I have almost forgot,—your pardon;—\r\nThe other, when she has obtain’d your eye,\r\nWill have your tongue too. This is a creature,\r\nWould she begin a sect, might quench the zeal\r\nOf all professors else; make proselytes\r\nOf who she but bid follow.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nHow! not women?\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nWomen will love her that she is a woman\r\nMore worth than any man; men, that she is\r\nThe rarest of all women.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nGo, Cleomenes;\r\nYourself, assisted with your honour’d friends,\r\nBring them to our embracement.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Cleomenes and others._]\r\n\r\nStill, ’tis strange\r\nHe thus should steal upon us.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nHad our prince,\r\nJewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair’d\r\nWell with this lord. There was not full a month\r\nBetween their births.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nPrithee no more; cease; Thou know’st\r\nHe dies to me again when talk’d of: sure,\r\nWhen I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches\r\nWill bring me to consider that which may\r\nUnfurnish me of reason. They are come.\r\n\r\n Enter Florizel, Perdita, Cleomenes and others.\r\n\r\nYour mother was most true to wedlock, prince;\r\nFor she did print your royal father off,\r\nConceiving you. Were I but twenty-one,\r\nYour father’s image is so hit in you,\r\nHis very air, that I should call you brother,\r\nAs I did him, and speak of something wildly\r\nBy us perform’d before. Most dearly welcome!\r\nAnd your fair princess,—goddess! O, alas!\r\nI lost a couple that ’twixt heaven and earth\r\nMight thus have stood, begetting wonder, as\r\nYou, gracious couple, do! And then I lost,—\r\nAll mine own folly,—the society,\r\nAmity too, of your brave father, whom,\r\nThough bearing misery, I desire my life\r\nOnce more to look on him.\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nBy his command\r\nHave I here touch’d Sicilia, and from him\r\nGive you all greetings that a king, at friend,\r\nCan send his brother: and, but infirmity,\r\nWhich waits upon worn times, hath something seiz’d\r\nHis wish’d ability, he had himself\r\nThe lands and waters ’twixt your throne and his\r\nMeasur’d, to look upon you; whom he loves,\r\nHe bade me say so,—more than all the sceptres\r\nAnd those that bear them living.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nO my brother,—\r\nGood gentleman!—the wrongs I have done thee stir\r\nAfresh within me; and these thy offices,\r\nSo rarely kind, are as interpreters\r\nOf my behind-hand slackness! Welcome hither,\r\nAs is the spring to the earth. And hath he too\r\nExpos’d this paragon to the fearful usage,\r\nAt least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,\r\nTo greet a man not worth her pains, much less\r\nTh’ adventure of her person?\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nGood, my lord,\r\nShe came from Libya.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nWhere the warlike Smalus,\r\nThat noble honour’d lord, is fear’d and lov’d?\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nMost royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughter\r\nHis tears proclaim’d his, parting with her: thence,\r\nA prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross’d,\r\nTo execute the charge my father gave me\r\nFor visiting your highness: my best train\r\nI have from your Sicilian shores dismiss’d;\r\nWho for Bohemia bend, to signify\r\nNot only my success in Libya, sir,\r\nBut my arrival, and my wife’s, in safety\r\nHere, where we are.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nThe blessed gods\r\nPurge all infection from our air whilst you\r\nDo climate here! You have a holy father,\r\nA graceful gentleman; against whose person,\r\nSo sacred as it is, I have done sin,\r\nFor which the heavens, taking angry note,\r\nHave left me issueless. And your father’s bless’d,\r\nAs he from heaven merits it, with you,\r\nWorthy his goodness. What might I have been,\r\nMight I a son and daughter now have look’d on,\r\nSuch goodly things as you!\r\n\r\n Enter a Lord.\r\n\r\nLORD.\r\nMost noble sir,\r\nThat which I shall report will bear no credit,\r\nWere not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir,\r\nBohemia greets you from himself by me;\r\nDesires you to attach his son, who has—\r\nHis dignity and duty both cast off—\r\nFled from his father, from his hopes, and with\r\nA shepherd’s daughter.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nWhere’s Bohemia? speak.\r\n\r\nLORD.\r\nHere in your city; I now came from him.\r\nI speak amazedly, and it becomes\r\nMy marvel and my message. To your court\r\nWhiles he was hast’ning—in the chase, it seems,\r\nOf this fair couple—meets he on the way\r\nThe father of this seeming lady and\r\nHer brother, having both their country quitted\r\nWith this young prince.\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nCamillo has betray’d me;\r\nWhose honour and whose honesty till now,\r\nEndur’d all weathers.\r\n\r\nLORD.\r\nLay ’t so to his charge.\r\nHe’s with the king your father.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nWho? Camillo?\r\n\r\nLORD.\r\nCamillo, sir; I spake with him; who now\r\nHas these poor men in question. Never saw I\r\nWretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth;\r\nForswear themselves as often as they speak.\r\nBohemia stops his ears, and threatens them\r\nWith divers deaths in death.\r\n\r\nPERDITA.\r\nO my poor father!\r\nThe heaven sets spies upon us, will not have\r\nOur contract celebrated.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nYou are married?\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nWe are not, sir, nor are we like to be.\r\nThe stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first.\r\nThe odds for high and low’s alike.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nMy lord,\r\nIs this the daughter of a king?\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nShe is,\r\nWhen once she is my wife.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nThat “once”, I see by your good father’s speed,\r\nWill come on very slowly. I am sorry,\r\nMost sorry, you have broken from his liking,\r\nWhere you were tied in duty; and as sorry\r\nYour choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,\r\nThat you might well enjoy her.\r\n\r\nFLORIZEL.\r\nDear, look up:\r\nThough Fortune, visible an enemy,\r\nShould chase us with my father, power no jot\r\nHath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,\r\nRemember since you ow’d no more to time\r\nThan I do now: with thought of such affections,\r\nStep forth mine advocate. At your request\r\nMy father will grant precious things as trifles.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nWould he do so, I’d beg your precious mistress,\r\nWhich he counts but a trifle.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nSir, my liege,\r\nYour eye hath too much youth in ’t: not a month\r\n’Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes\r\nThan what you look on now.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nI thought of her\r\nEven in these looks I made. [_To Florizel._] But your petition\r\nIs yet unanswer’d. I will to your father.\r\nYour honour not o’erthrown by your desires,\r\nI am friend to them and you: upon which errand\r\nI now go toward him; therefore follow me,\r\nAnd mark what way I make. Come, good my lord.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. The same. Before the Palace.\r\n\r\n Enter Autolycus and a Gentleman.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nBeseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\r\nI was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old shepherd deliver\r\nthe manner how he found it: whereupon, after a little amazedness, we\r\nwere all commanded out of the chamber; only this, methought I heard the\r\nshepherd say he found the child.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nI would most gladly know the issue of it.\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\r\nI make a broken delivery of the business; but the changes I perceived\r\nin the king and Camillo were very notes of admiration. They seemed\r\nalmost, with staring on one another, to tear the cases of their eyes.\r\nThere was speech in their dumbness, language in their very gesture;\r\nthey looked as they had heard of a world ransomed, or one destroyed. A\r\nnotable passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest beholder,\r\nthat knew no more but seeing could not say if th’ importance were joy\r\nor sorrow; but in the extremity of the one, it must needs be. Here\r\ncomes a gentleman that happily knows more.\r\n\r\n Enter a Gentleman.\r\n\r\nThe news, Rogero?\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\r\nNothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled: the king’s daughter is\r\nfound: such a deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that\r\nballad-makers cannot be able to express it. Here comes the Lady\r\nPaulina’s steward: he can deliver you more.\r\n\r\n Enter a third Gentleman.\r\n\r\n How goes it now, sir? This news, which is called true, is so like an\r\n old tale that the verity of it is in strong suspicion. Has the king\r\n found his heir?\r\n\r\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.\r\nMost true, if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance. That which you\r\nhear you’ll swear you see, there is such unity in the proofs. The\r\nmantle of Queen Hermione’s, her jewel about the neck of it, the letters\r\nof Antigonus found with it, which they know to be his character; the\r\nmajesty of the creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection of\r\nnobleness which nature shows above her breeding, and many other\r\nevidences proclaim her with all certainty to be the king’s daughter.\r\nDid you see the meeting of the two kings?\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.\r\nThen you have lost a sight which was to be seen, cannot be spoken of.\r\nThere might you have beheld one joy crown another, so and in such\r\nmanner that it seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their joy\r\nwaded in tears. There was casting up of eyes, holding up of hands, with\r\ncountenance of such distraction that they were to be known by garment,\r\nnot by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of himself for joy of\r\nhis found daughter, as if that joy were now become a loss, cries “O,\r\nthy mother, thy mother!” then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then embraces\r\nhis son-in-law; then again worries he his daughter with clipping her;\r\nnow he thanks the old shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten\r\nconduit of many kings’ reigns. I never heard of such another encounter,\r\nwhich lames report to follow it, and undoes description to do it.\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\r\nWhat, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried hence the child?\r\n\r\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.\r\nLike an old tale still, which will have matter to rehearse, though\r\ncredit be asleep and not an ear open. He was torn to pieces with a\r\nbear: this avouches the shepherd’s son, who has not only his innocence,\r\nwhich seems much, to justify him, but a handkerchief and rings of his\r\nthat Paulina knows.\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\r\nWhat became of his bark and his followers?\r\n\r\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.\r\nWrecked the same instant of their master’s death, and in the view of\r\nthe shepherd: so that all the instruments which aided to expose the\r\nchild were even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble combat\r\nthat ’twixt joy and sorrow was fought in Paulina! She had one eye\r\ndeclined for the loss of her husband, another elevated that the oracle\r\nwas fulfilled. She lifted the princess from the earth, and so locks her\r\nin embracing, as if she would pin her to her heart, that she might no\r\nmore be in danger of losing.\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\r\nThe dignity of this act was worth the audience of kings and princes;\r\nfor by such was it acted.\r\n\r\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.\r\nOne of the prettiest touches of all, and that which angled for mine\r\neyes (caught the water, though not the fish) was, when at the relation\r\nof the queen’s death (with the manner how she came to it bravely\r\nconfessed and lamented by the king) how attentiveness wounded his\r\ndaughter; till, from one sign of dolour to another, she did, with an\r\n“Alas,” I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my heart wept\r\nblood. Who was most marble there changed colour; some swooned, all\r\nsorrowed: if all the world could have seen it, the woe had been\r\nuniversal.\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\r\nAre they returned to the court?\r\n\r\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.\r\nNo: the princess hearing of her mother’s statue, which is in the\r\nkeeping of Paulina,—a piece many years in doing and now newly performed\r\nby that rare Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself\r\neternity, and could put breath into his work, would beguile Nature of\r\nher custom, so perfectly he is her ape: he so near to Hermione hath\r\ndone Hermione that they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of\r\nanswer. Thither with all greediness of affection are they gone, and\r\nthere they intend to sup.\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN.\r\nI thought she had some great matter there in hand; for she hath\r\nprivately twice or thrice a day, ever since the death of Hermione,\r\nvisited that removed house. Shall we thither, and with our company\r\npiece the rejoicing?\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN.\r\nWho would be thence that has the benefit of access? Every wink of an\r\neye some new grace will be born. Our absence makes us unthrifty to our\r\nknowledge. Let’s along.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Gentlemen._]\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nNow, had I not the dash of my former life in me, would preferment drop\r\non my head. I brought the old man and his son aboard the prince; told\r\nhim I heard them talk of a fardel and I know not what. But he at that\r\ntime over-fond of the shepherd’s daughter (so he then took her to be),\r\nwho began to be much sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of\r\nweather continuing, this mystery remained undiscover’d. But ’tis all\r\none to me; for had I been the finder-out of this secret, it would not\r\nhave relish’d among my other discredits.\r\n\r\n Enter Shepherd and Clown.\r\n\r\nHere come those I have done good to against my will, and already\r\nappearing in the blossoms of their fortune.\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nCome, boy; I am past more children, but thy sons and daughters will be\r\nall gentlemen born.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nYou are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me this other day,\r\nbecause I was no gentleman born. See you these clothes? Say you see\r\nthem not and think me still no gentleman born: you were best say these\r\nrobes are not gentlemen born. Give me the lie, do; and try whether I am\r\nnot now a gentleman born.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nI know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nAy, and have been so any time these four hours.\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nAnd so have I, boy!\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nSo you have: but I was a gentleman born before my father; for the\r\nking’s son took me by the hand and called me brother; and then the two\r\nkings called my father brother; and then the prince, my brother, and\r\nthe princess, my sister, called my father father; and so we wept; and\r\nthere was the first gentleman-like tears that ever we shed.\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nWe may live, son, to shed many more.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nAy; or else ’twere hard luck, being in so preposterous estate as we\r\nare.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nI humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the faults I have committed\r\nto your worship, and to give me your good report to the prince my\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nPrithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are gentlemen.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nThou wilt amend thy life?\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nAy, an it like your good worship.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nGive me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou art as honest a true\r\nfellow as any is in Bohemia.\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nYou may say it, but not swear it.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNot swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and franklins say it,\r\nI’ll swear it.\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD.\r\nHow if it be false, son?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nIf it be ne’er so false, a true gentleman may swear it in the behalf of\r\nhis friend. And I’ll swear to the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy\r\nhands and that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no tall\r\nfellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be drunk: but I’ll swear it; and\r\nI would thou wouldst be a tall fellow of thy hands.\r\n\r\nAUTOLYCUS.\r\nI will prove so, sir, to my power.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nAy, by any means, prove a tall fellow: if I do not wonder how thou\r\ndar’st venture to be drunk, not being a tall fellow, trust me not.\r\nHark! the kings and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the\r\nqueen’s picture. Come, follow us: we’ll be thy good masters.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. The same. A Room in Paulina’s house.\r\n\r\n Enter Leontes, Polixenes, Florizel, Perdita, Camillo, Paulina, Lords\r\n and Attendants.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nO grave and good Paulina, the great comfort\r\nThat I have had of thee!\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nWhat, sovereign sir,\r\nI did not well, I meant well. All my services\r\nYou have paid home: but that you have vouchsaf’d,\r\nWith your crown’d brother and these your contracted\r\nHeirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,\r\nIt is a surplus of your grace which never\r\nMy life may last to answer.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nO Paulina,\r\nWe honour you with trouble. But we came\r\nTo see the statue of our queen: your gallery\r\nHave we pass’d through, not without much content\r\nIn many singularities; but we saw not\r\nThat which my daughter came to look upon,\r\nThe statue of her mother.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nAs she liv’d peerless,\r\nSo her dead likeness, I do well believe,\r\nExcels whatever yet you look’d upon\r\nOr hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it\r\nLonely, apart. But here it is: prepare\r\nTo see the life as lively mock’d as ever\r\nStill sleep mock’d death. Behold, and say ’tis well.\r\n\r\n Paulina undraws a curtain, and discovers Hermione standing as a\r\n statue.\r\n\r\nI like your silence, it the more shows off\r\nYour wonder: but yet speak. First you, my liege.\r\nComes it not something near?\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nHer natural posture!\r\nChide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed\r\nThou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she\r\nIn thy not chiding; for she was as tender\r\nAs infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,\r\nHermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing\r\nSo aged as this seems.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nO, not by much!\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nSo much the more our carver’s excellence,\r\nWhich lets go by some sixteen years and makes her\r\nAs she liv’d now.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nAs now she might have done,\r\nSo much to my good comfort as it is\r\nNow piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,\r\nEven with such life of majesty, warm life,\r\nAs now it coldly stands, when first I woo’d her!\r\nI am asham’d: does not the stone rebuke me\r\nFor being more stone than it? O royal piece,\r\nThere’s magic in thy majesty, which has\r\nMy evils conjur’d to remembrance and\r\nFrom thy admiring daughter took the spirits,\r\nStanding like stone with thee.\r\n\r\nPERDITA.\r\nAnd give me leave,\r\nAnd do not say ’tis superstition, that\r\nI kneel, and then implore her blessing. Lady,\r\nDear queen, that ended when I but began,\r\nGive me that hand of yours to kiss.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nO, patience!\r\nThe statue is but newly fix’d, the colour’s\r\nNot dry.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nMy lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,\r\nWhich sixteen winters cannot blow away,\r\nSo many summers dry. Scarce any joy\r\nDid ever so long live; no sorrow\r\nBut kill’d itself much sooner.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nDear my brother,\r\nLet him that was the cause of this have power\r\nTo take off so much grief from you as he\r\nWill piece up in himself.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nIndeed, my lord,\r\nIf I had thought the sight of my poor image\r\nWould thus have wrought you—for the stone is mine—\r\nI’d not have show’d it.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nDo not draw the curtain.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nNo longer shall you gaze on’t, lest your fancy\r\nMay think anon it moves.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nLet be, let be.\r\nWould I were dead, but that methinks already—\r\nWhat was he that did make it? See, my lord,\r\nWould you not deem it breath’d? And that those veins\r\nDid verily bear blood?\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nMasterly done:\r\nThe very life seems warm upon her lip.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nThe fixture of her eye has motion in ’t,\r\nAs we are mock’d with art.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nI’ll draw the curtain:\r\nMy lord’s almost so far transported that\r\nHe’ll think anon it lives.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nO sweet Paulina,\r\nMake me to think so twenty years together!\r\nNo settled senses of the world can match\r\nThe pleasure of that madness. Let ’t alone.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nI am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr’d you: but\r\nI could afflict you further.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nDo, Paulina;\r\nFor this affliction has a taste as sweet\r\nAs any cordial comfort. Still methinks\r\nThere is an air comes from her. What fine chisel\r\nCould ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,\r\nFor I will kiss her!\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nGood my lord, forbear:\r\nThe ruddiness upon her lip is wet;\r\nYou’ll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own\r\nWith oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nNo, not these twenty years.\r\n\r\nPERDITA.\r\nSo long could I\r\nStand by, a looker on.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nEither forbear,\r\nQuit presently the chapel, or resolve you\r\nFor more amazement. If you can behold it,\r\nI’ll make the statue move indeed, descend,\r\nAnd take you by the hand. But then you’ll think\r\n(Which I protest against) I am assisted\r\nBy wicked powers.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nWhat you can make her do\r\nI am content to look on: what to speak,\r\nI am content to hear; for ’tis as easy\r\nTo make her speak as move.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nIt is requir’d\r\nYou do awake your faith. Then all stand still;\r\nOr those that think it is unlawful business\r\nI am about, let them depart.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nProceed:\r\nNo foot shall stir.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nMusic, awake her: strike! [_Music._]\r\n’Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;\r\nStrike all that look upon with marvel. Come;\r\nI’ll fill your grave up: stir; nay, come away.\r\nBequeath to death your numbness, for from him\r\nDear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs.\r\n\r\n Hermione comes down from the pedestal.\r\n\r\nStart not; her actions shall be holy as\r\nYou hear my spell is lawful. Do not shun her\r\nUntil you see her die again; for then\r\nYou kill her double. Nay, present your hand:\r\nWhen she was young you woo’d her; now in age\r\nIs she become the suitor?\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\n[_Embracing her._] O, she’s warm!\r\nIf this be magic, let it be an art\r\nLawful as eating.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nShe embraces him.\r\n\r\nCAMILLO.\r\nShe hangs about his neck.\r\nIf she pertain to life, let her speak too.\r\n\r\nPOLIXENES.\r\nAy, and make it manifest where she has liv’d,\r\nOr how stol’n from the dead.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nThat she is living,\r\nWere it but told you, should be hooted at\r\nLike an old tale; but it appears she lives,\r\nThough yet she speak not. Mark a little while.\r\nPlease you to interpose, fair madam. Kneel\r\nAnd pray your mother’s blessing. Turn, good lady,\r\nOur Perdita is found.\r\n\r\n [_Presenting Perdita who kneels to Hermione._]\r\n\r\nHERMIONE.\r\nYou gods, look down,\r\nAnd from your sacred vials pour your graces\r\nUpon my daughter’s head! Tell me, mine own,\r\nWhere hast thou been preserv’d? where liv’d? how found\r\nThy father’s court? for thou shalt hear that I,\r\nKnowing by Paulina that the oracle\r\nGave hope thou wast in being, have preserv’d\r\nMyself to see the issue.\r\n\r\nPAULINA.\r\nThere’s time enough for that;\r\nLest they desire upon this push to trouble\r\nYour joys with like relation. Go together,\r\nYou precious winners all; your exultation\r\nPartake to everyone. I, an old turtle,\r\nWill wing me to some wither’d bough, and there\r\nMy mate, that’s never to be found again,\r\nLament till I am lost.\r\n\r\nLEONTES.\r\nO peace, Paulina!\r\nThou shouldst a husband take by my consent,\r\nAs I by thine a wife: this is a match,\r\nAnd made between ’s by vows. Thou hast found mine;\r\nBut how, is to be question’d; for I saw her,\r\nAs I thought, dead; and have in vain said many\r\nA prayer upon her grave. I’ll not seek far—\r\nFor him, I partly know his mind—to find thee\r\nAn honourable husband. Come, Camillo,\r\nAnd take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty\r\nIs richly noted, and here justified\r\nBy us, a pair of kings. Let’s from this place.\r\nWhat! look upon my brother: both your pardons,\r\nThat e’er I put between your holy looks\r\nMy ill suspicion. This your son-in-law,\r\nAnd son unto the king, whom heavens directing,\r\nIs troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,\r\nLead us from hence; where we may leisurely\r\nEach one demand, and answer to his part\r\nPerform’d in this wide gap of time, since first\r\nWe were dissever’d. Hastily lead away!\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\nA LOVER’S COMPLAINT\r\n\nFrom off a hill whose concave womb reworded\r\nA plaintful story from a sist’ring vale,\r\nMy spirits t’attend this double voice accorded,\r\nAnd down I laid to list the sad-tun’d tale;\r\nEre long espied a fickle maid full pale,\r\nTearing of papers, breaking rings a-twain,\r\nStorming her world with sorrow’s wind and rain.\r\n\r\nUpon her head a platted hive of straw,\r\nWhich fortified her visage from the sun,\r\nWhereon the thought might think sometime it saw\r\nThe carcass of a beauty spent and done;\r\nTime had not scythed all that youth begun,\r\nNor youth all quit, but spite of heaven’s fell rage\r\nSome beauty peeped through lattice of sear’d age.\r\n\r\nOft did she heave her napkin to her eyne,\r\nWhich on it had conceited characters,\r\nLaund’ring the silken figures in the brine\r\nThat seasoned woe had pelleted in tears,\r\nAnd often reading what contents it bears;\r\nAs often shrieking undistinguish’d woe,\r\nIn clamours of all size, both high and low.\r\n\r\nSometimes her levell’d eyes their carriage ride,\r\nAs they did batt’ry to the spheres intend;\r\nSometime diverted their poor balls are tied\r\nTo th’orbed earth; sometimes they do extend\r\nTheir view right on; anon their gazes lend\r\nTo every place at once, and nowhere fix’d,\r\nThe mind and sight distractedly commix’d.\r\n\r\nHer hair, nor loose nor tied in formal plat,\r\nProclaim’d in her a careless hand of pride;\r\nFor some untuck’d descended her sheav’d hat,\r\nHanging her pale and pined cheek beside;\r\nSome in her threaden fillet still did bide,\r\nAnd, true to bondage, would not break from thence,\r\nThough slackly braided in loose negligence.\r\n\r\nA thousand favours from a maund she drew,\r\nOf amber, crystal, and of beaded jet,\r\nWhich one by one she in a river threw,\r\nUpon whose weeping margent she was set,\r\nLike usury applying wet to wet,\r\nOr monarchs’ hands, that lets not bounty fall\r\nWhere want cries ‘some,’ but where excess begs ‘all’.\r\n\r\nOf folded schedules had she many a one,\r\nWhich she perus’d, sigh’d, tore and gave the flood;\r\nCrack’d many a ring of posied gold and bone,\r\nBidding them find their sepulchres in mud;\r\nFound yet mo letters sadly penn’d in blood,\r\nWith sleided silk, feat and affectedly\r\nEnswath’d, and seal’d to curious secrecy.\r\n\r\nThese often bath’d she in her fluxive eyes,\r\nAnd often kiss’d, and often gave to tear;\r\nCried, ‘O false blood, thou register of lies,\r\nWhat unapproved witness dost thou bear!\r\nInk would have seem’d more black and damned here!’\r\nThis said, in top of rage the lines she rents,\r\nBig discontent so breaking their contents.\r\n\r\nA reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh,\r\nSometime a blusterer, that the ruffle knew\r\nOf court, of city, and had let go by\r\nThe swiftest hours observed as they flew,\r\nTowards this afflicted fancy fastly drew;\r\nAnd, privileg’d by age, desires to know\r\nIn brief the grounds and motives of her woe.\r\n\r\nSo slides he down upon his grained bat,\r\nAnd comely distant sits he by her side,\r\nWhen he again desires her, being sat,\r\nHer grievance with his hearing to divide:\r\nIf that from him there may be aught applied\r\nWhich may her suffering ecstasy assuage,\r\n’Tis promised in the charity of age.\r\n\r\n‘Father,’ she says, ‘though in me you behold\r\nThe injury of many a blasting hour,\r\nLet it not tell your judgement I am old,\r\nNot age, but sorrow, over me hath power.\r\nI might as yet have been a spreading flower,\r\nFresh to myself, if I had self-applied\r\nLove to myself, and to no love beside.\r\n\r\n‘But woe is me! Too early I attended\r\nA youthful suit; it was to gain my grace;\r\nO one by nature’s outwards so commended,\r\nThat maiden’s eyes stuck over all his face,\r\nLove lack’d a dwelling and made him her place;\r\nAnd when in his fair parts she did abide,\r\nShe was new lodg’d and newly deified.\r\n\r\n‘His browny locks did hang in crooked curls,\r\nAnd every light occasion of the wind\r\nUpon his lips their silken parcels hurls,\r\nWhat’s sweet to do, to do will aptly find,\r\nEach eye that saw him did enchant the mind:\r\nFor on his visage was in little drawn,\r\nWhat largeness thinks in paradise was sawn.\r\n\r\n‘Small show of man was yet upon his chin;\r\nHis phoenix down began but to appear,\r\nLike unshorn velvet, on that termless skin,\r\nWhose bare out-bragg’d the web it seemed to wear.\r\nYet show’d his visage by that cost more dear,\r\nAnd nice affections wavering stood in doubt\r\nIf best were as it was, or best without.\r\n\r\n‘His qualities were beauteous as his form,\r\nFor maiden-tongued he was, and thereof free;\r\nYet if men mov’d him, was he such a storm\r\nAs oft ’twixt May and April is to see,\r\nWhen winds breathe sweet, unruly though they be.\r\nHis rudeness so with his authoriz’d youth\r\nDid livery falseness in a pride of truth.\r\n\r\n‘Well could he ride, and often men would say\r\nThat horse his mettle from his rider takes,\r\nProud of subjection, noble by the sway,\r\nWhat rounds, what bounds, what course, what stop he makes!\r\nAnd controversy hence a question takes,\r\nWhether the horse by him became his deed,\r\nOr he his manage by th’ well-doing steed.\r\n\r\n‘But quickly on this side the verdict went,\r\nHis real habitude gave life and grace\r\nTo appertainings and to ornament,\r\nAccomplish’d in himself, not in his case;\r\nAll aids, themselves made fairer by their place,\r\nCame for additions; yet their purpos’d trim\r\nPiec’d not his grace, but were all grac’d by him.\r\n\r\n‘So on the tip of his subduing tongue\r\nAll kind of arguments and question deep,\r\nAll replication prompt, and reason strong,\r\nFor his advantage still did wake and sleep,\r\nTo make the weeper laugh, the laugher weep:\r\nHe had the dialect and different skill,\r\nCatching all passions in his craft of will.\r\n\r\n‘That he did in the general bosom reign\r\nOf young, of old, and sexes both enchanted,\r\nTo dwell with him in thoughts, or to remain\r\nIn personal duty, following where he haunted,\r\nConsent’s bewitch’d, ere he desire, have granted,\r\nAnd dialogued for him what he would say,\r\nAsk’d their own wills, and made their wills obey.\r\n\r\n‘Many there were that did his picture get\r\nTo serve their eyes, and in it put their mind,\r\nLike fools that in th’ imagination set\r\nThe goodly objects which abroad they find\r\nOf lands and mansions, theirs in thought assign’d,\r\nAnd labouring in moe pleasures to bestow them,\r\nThan the true gouty landlord which doth owe them.\r\n\r\n‘So many have, that never touch’d his hand,\r\nSweetly suppos’d them mistress of his heart.\r\nMy woeful self that did in freedom stand,\r\nAnd was my own fee-simple (not in part)\r\nWhat with his art in youth, and youth in art,\r\nThrew my affections in his charmed power,\r\nReserv’d the stalk and gave him all my flower.\r\n\r\n‘Yet did I not, as some my equals did,\r\nDemand of him, nor being desired yielded,\r\nFinding myself in honour so forbid,\r\nWith safest distance I mine honour shielded.\r\nExperience for me many bulwarks builded\r\nOf proofs new-bleeding, which remain’d the foil\r\nOf this false jewel, and his amorous spoil.\r\n\r\n‘But ah! Who ever shunn’d by precedent\r\nThe destin’d ill she must herself assay,\r\nOr force’d examples ’gainst her own content,\r\nTo put the by-pass’d perils in her way?\r\nCounsel may stop a while what will not stay:\r\nFor when we rage, advice is often seen\r\nBy blunting us to make our wills more keen.\r\n\r\n‘Nor gives it satisfaction to our blood,\r\nThat we must curb it upon others’ proof,\r\nTo be forbode the sweets that seems so good,\r\nFor fear of harms that preach in our behoof.\r\nO appetite, from judgement stand aloof!\r\nThe one a palate hath that needs will taste,\r\nThough reason weep and cry, “It is thy last.”\r\n\r\n‘For further I could say, “This man’s untrue”,\r\nAnd knew the patterns of his foul beguiling;\r\nHeard where his plants in others’ orchards grew,\r\nSaw how deceits were gilded in his smiling;\r\nKnew vows were ever brokers to defiling;\r\nThought characters and words merely but art,\r\nAnd bastards of his foul adulterate heart.\r\n\r\n‘And long upon these terms I held my city,\r\nTill thus he ’gan besiege me: “Gentle maid,\r\nHave of my suffering youth some feeling pity,\r\nAnd be not of my holy vows afraid:\r\nThat’s to ye sworn, to none was ever said,\r\nFor feasts of love I have been call’d unto,\r\nTill now did ne’er invite, nor never woo.\r\n\r\n‘“All my offences that abroad you see\r\nAre errors of the blood, none of the mind:\r\nLove made them not; with acture they may be,\r\nWhere neither party is nor true nor kind,\r\nThey sought their shame that so their shame did find,\r\nAnd so much less of shame in me remains,\r\nBy how much of me their reproach contains.\r\n\r\n‘“Among the many that mine eyes have seen,\r\nNot one whose flame my heart so much as warmed,\r\nOr my affection put to th’ smallest teen,\r\nOr any of my leisures ever charmed:\r\nHarm have I done to them, but ne’er was harmed;\r\nKept hearts in liveries, but mine own was free,\r\nAnd reign’d commanding in his monarchy.\r\n\r\n‘“Look here what tributes wounded fancies sent me,\r\nOf pallid pearls and rubies red as blood,\r\nFiguring that they their passions likewise lent me\r\nOf grief and blushes, aptly understood\r\nIn bloodless white and the encrimson’d mood;\r\nEffects of terror and dear modesty,\r\nEncamp’d in hearts, but fighting outwardly.\r\n\r\n‘“And, lo! behold these talents of their hair,\r\nWith twisted metal amorously empleach’d,\r\nI have receiv’d from many a several fair,\r\nTheir kind acceptance weepingly beseech’d,\r\nWith th’ annexions of fair gems enrich’d,\r\nAnd deep-brain’d sonnets that did amplify\r\nEach stone’s dear nature, worth and quality.\r\n\r\n‘“The diamond, why ’twas beautiful and hard,\r\nWhereto his invis’d properties did tend,\r\nThe deep green emerald, in whose fresh regard\r\nWeak sights their sickly radiance do amend;\r\nThe heaven-hued sapphire and the opal blend\r\nWith objects manifold; each several stone,\r\nWith wit well blazon’d smil’d, or made some moan.\r\n\r\n‘“Lo, all these trophies of affections hot,\r\nOf pensiv’d and subdued desires the tender,\r\nNature hath charg’d me that I hoard them not,\r\nBut yield them up where I myself must render,\r\nThat is, to you, my origin and ender:\r\nFor these of force must your oblations be,\r\nSince I their altar, you empatron me.\r\n\r\n‘“O then advance of yours that phraseless hand,\r\nWhose white weighs down the airy scale of praise;\r\nTake all these similes to your own command,\r\nHallowed with sighs that burning lungs did raise:\r\nWhat me, your minister for you, obeys,\r\nWorks under you; and to your audit comes\r\nTheir distract parcels in combined sums.\r\n\r\n‘“Lo, this device was sent me from a nun,\r\nOr sister sanctified of holiest note,\r\nWhich late her noble suit in court did shun,\r\nWhose rarest havings made the blossoms dote;\r\nFor she was sought by spirits of richest coat,\r\nBut kept cold distance, and did thence remove\r\nTo spend her living in eternal love.\r\n\r\n‘“But O, my sweet, what labour is’t to leave\r\nThe thing we have not, mast’ring what not strives,\r\nPlaning the place which did no form receive,\r\nPlaying patient sports in unconstrained gyves,\r\nShe that her fame so to herself contrives,\r\nThe scars of battle ’scapeth by the flight,\r\nAnd makes her absence valiant, not her might.\r\n\r\n‘“O pardon me, in that my boast is true,\r\nThe accident which brought me to her eye,\r\nUpon the moment did her force subdue,\r\nAnd now she would the caged cloister fly:\r\nReligious love put out religion’s eye:\r\nNot to be tempted would she be immur’d,\r\nAnd now to tempt all, liberty procur’d.\r\n\r\n‘“How mighty then you are, O hear me tell!\r\nThe broken bosoms that to me belong\r\nHave emptied all their fountains in my well,\r\nAnd mine I pour your ocean all among:\r\nI strong o’er them, and you o’er me being strong,\r\nMust for your victory us all congest,\r\nAs compound love to physic your cold breast.\r\n\r\n‘“My parts had pow’r to charm a sacred nun,\r\nWho, disciplin’d and dieted in grace,\r\nBeliev’d her eyes when they t’assail begun,\r\nAll vows and consecrations giving place.\r\nO most potential love! Vow, bond, nor space,\r\nIn thee hath neither sting, knot, nor confine,\r\nFor thou art all and all things else are thine.\r\n\r\n‘“When thou impressest, what are precepts worth\r\nOf stale example? When thou wilt inflame,\r\nHow coldly those impediments stand forth,\r\nOf wealth, of filial fear, law, kindred, fame!\r\nLove’s arms are peace, ’gainst rule, ’gainst sense, ’gainst shame,\r\nAnd sweetens, in the suff’ring pangs it bears,\r\nThe aloes of all forces, shocks and fears.\r\n\r\n‘“Now all these hearts that do on mine depend,\r\nFeeling it break, with bleeding groans they pine,\r\nAnd supplicant their sighs to your extend,\r\nTo leave the batt’ry that you make ’gainst mine,\r\nLending soft audience to my sweet design,\r\nAnd credent soul to that strong-bonded oath,\r\nThat shall prefer and undertake my troth.”\r\n\r\n‘This said, his wat’ry eyes he did dismount,\r\nWhose sights till then were levell’d on my face;\r\nEach cheek a river running from a fount\r\nWith brinish current downward flowed apace.\r\nO how the channel to the stream gave grace!\r\nWho, glaz’d with crystal gate the glowing roses\r\nThat flame through water which their hue encloses.\r\n\r\n‘O father, what a hell of witchcraft lies\r\nIn the small orb of one particular tear!\r\nBut with the inundation of the eyes\r\nWhat rocky heart to water will not wear?\r\nWhat breast so cold that is not warmed here?\r\nO cleft effect! Cold modesty, hot wrath,\r\nBoth fire from hence and chill extincture hath.\r\n\r\n‘For lo, his passion, but an art of craft,\r\nEven there resolv’d my reason into tears;\r\nThere my white stole of chastity I daff’d,\r\nShook off my sober guards, and civil fears,\r\nAppear to him as he to me appears,\r\nAll melting, though our drops this diff’rence bore:\r\nHis poison’d me, and mine did him restore.\r\n\r\n‘In him a plenitude of subtle matter,\r\nApplied to cautels, all strange forms receives,\r\nOf burning blushes, or of weeping water,\r\nOr swooning paleness; and he takes and leaves,\r\nIn either’s aptness, as it best deceives,\r\nTo blush at speeches rank, to weep at woes,\r\nOr to turn white and swoon at tragic shows.\r\n\r\n‘That not a heart which in his level came\r\nCould ’scape the hail of his all-hurting aim,\r\nShowing fair nature is both kind and tame;\r\nAnd veil’d in them, did win whom he would maim.\r\nAgainst the thing he sought he would exclaim;\r\nWhen he most burned in heart-wish’d luxury,\r\nHe preach’d pure maid, and prais’d cold chastity.\r\n\r\n‘Thus merely with the garment of a grace,\r\nThe naked and concealed fiend he cover’d,\r\nThat th’unexperient gave the tempter place,\r\nWhich, like a cherubin, above them hover’d.\r\nWho, young and simple, would not be so lover’d?\r\nAy me! I fell, and yet do question make\r\nWhat I should do again for such a sake.\r\n\r\n‘O, that infected moisture of his eye,\r\nO, that false fire which in his cheek so glow’d!\r\nO, that forc’d thunder from his heart did fly,\r\nO, that sad breath his spongy lungs bestow’d,\r\nO, all that borrowed motion, seeming owed,\r\nWould yet again betray the fore-betrayed,\r\nAnd new pervert a reconciled maid.’\r\n\nTHE PASSIONATE PILGRIM\r\n\nI\r\n\nWhen my love swears that she is made of truth,\r\nI do believe her, though I know she lies,\r\nThat she might think me some untutor’d youth,\r\nUnskilful in the world’s false forgeries.\r\nThus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,\r\nAlthough I know my years be past the best,\r\nI smiling credit her false-speaking tongue,\r\nOutfacing faults in love with love’s ill rest.\r\nBut wherefore says my love that she is young?\r\nAnd wherefore say not I that I am old?\r\nO, love’s best habit is a soothing tongue,\r\nAnd age, in love, loves not to have years told.\r\n Therefore, I’ll lie with love, and love with me,\r\n Since that our faults in love thus smother’d be.\r\n\nII\r\n\nTwo loves I have, of comfort and despair,\r\nThat like two spirits do suggest me still;\r\nMy better angel is a man right fair,\r\nMy worser spirit a woman colour’d ill.\r\nTo win me soon to hell, my female evil\r\nTempteth my better angel from my side,\r\nAnd would corrupt my saint to be a devil,\r\nWooing his purity with her fair pride.\r\nAnd whether that my angel be turn’d fiend,\r\nSuspect I may, yet not directly tell;\r\nFor being both to me, both to each friend,\r\nI guess one angel in another’s hell:\r\n The truth I shall not know, but live in doubt,\r\n Till my bad angel fire my good one out.\r\n\nIII\r\n\nDid not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye,\r\n’Gainst whom the world could not hold argument,\r\nPersuade my heart to this false perjury?\r\nVows for thee broke deserve not punishment.\r\nA woman I forswore; but I will prove,\r\nThou being a goddess, I forswore not thee:\r\nMy vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love;\r\nThy grace being gain’d cures all disgrace in me.\r\nMy vow was breath, and breath a vapour is;\r\nThen, thou fair sun, that on this earth doth shine,\r\nExhale this vapour vow; in thee it is;\r\nIf broken then, it is no fault of mine.\r\n If by me broke, what fool is not so wise\r\n To break an oath, to win a paradise?\r\n\nIV\r\n\nSweet Cytherea, sitting by a brook\r\nWith young Adonis, lovely, fresh and green,\r\nDid court the lad with many a lovely look,\r\nSuch looks as none could look but beauty’s queen.\r\nShe told him stories to delight his ear;\r\nShe show’d him favours to allure his eye;\r\nTo win his heart, she touch’d him here and there;\r\nTouches so soft still conquer chastity.\r\nBut whether unripe years did want conceit,\r\nOr he refus’d to take her figur’d proffer,\r\nThe tender nibbler would not touch the bait,\r\nBut smile and jest at every gentle offer.\r\n Then fell she on her back, fair queen, and toward:\r\n He rose and ran away; ah, fool too froward!\r\n\nV\r\n\nIf love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to love?\r\nO never faith could hold, if not to beauty vowed.\r\nThough to myself forsworn, to thee I’ll constant prove;\r\nThose thoughts, to me like oaks, to thee like osiers bowed.\r\nStudy his bias leaves, and makes his book thine eyes,\r\nWhere all those pleasures live that art can comprehend.\r\nIf knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice;\r\nWell learned is that tongue that well can thee commend,\r\nAll ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder;\r\nWhich is to me some praise, that I thy parts admire.\r\nThine eye Jove’s lightning seems, thy voice his dreadful thunder,\r\nWhich, not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire.\r\n Celestial as thou art, O do not love that wrong,\r\n To sing heaven’s praise with such an earthly tongue.\r\n\nVI\r\n\nScarce had the sun dried up the dewy morn,\r\nAnd scarce the herd gone to the hedge for shade,\r\nWhen Cytherea, all in love forlorn,\r\nA longing tarriance for Adonis made\r\nUnder an osier growing by a brook,\r\nA brook where Adon used to cool his spleen.\r\nHot was the day; she hotter that did look\r\nFor his approach, that often there had been.\r\nAnon he comes, and throws his mantle by,\r\nAnd stood stark naked on the brook’s green brim:\r\nThe sun look’d on the world with glorious eye,\r\nYet not so wistly as this queen on him.\r\n He, spying her, bounc’d in, whereas he stood,\r\n “O Jove,” quoth she, “why was not I a flood?”\r\n\nVII\r\n\nFair is my love, but not so fair as fickle,\r\nMild as a dove, but neither true nor trusty,\r\nBrighter than glass, and yet, as glass is, brittle,\r\nSofter than wax, and yet, as iron, rusty:\r\n A lily pale, with damask dye to grace her,\r\n None fairer, nor none falser to deface her.\r\n\r\nHer lips to mine how often hath she joined,\r\nBetween each kiss her oaths of true love swearing!\r\nHow many tales to please me hath she coined,\r\nDreading my love, the loss thereof still fearing!\r\n Yet in the midst of all her pure protestings,\r\n Her faith, her oaths, her tears, and all were jestings.\r\n\r\nShe burnt with love, as straw with fire flameth;\r\nShe burnt out love, as soon as straw out-burneth;\r\nShe fram’d the love, and yet she foil’d the framing;\r\nShe bade love last, and yet she fell a-turning.\r\n Was this a lover, or a lecher whether?\r\n Bad in the best, though excellent in neither.\r\n\nVIII\r\n\nIf music and sweet poetry agree,\r\nAs they must needs, the sister and the brother,\r\nThen must the love be great ’twixt thee and me,\r\nBecause thou lov’st the one and I the other.\r\nDowland to thee is dear, whose heavenly touch\r\nUpon the lute doth ravish human sense;\r\nSpenser to me, whose deep conceit is such\r\nAs passing all conceit, needs no defence.\r\nThou lov’st to hear the sweet melodious sound\r\nThat Phœbus’ lute, the queen of music, makes;\r\nAnd I in deep delight am chiefly drown’d\r\nWhenas himself to singing he betakes.\r\n One god is god of both, as poets feign;\r\n One knight loves both, and both in thee remain.\r\n\nIX\r\n\nFair was the morn when the fair queen of love,\r\n * * * * * *\r\nPaler for sorrow than her milk-white dove,\r\nFor Adon’s sake, a youngster proud and wild;\r\nHer stand she takes upon a steep-up hill;\r\nAnon Adonis comes with horn and hounds;\r\nShe, silly queen, with more than love’s good will,\r\nForbade the boy he should not pass those grounds.\r\n“Once,” quoth she, “did I see a fair sweet youth\r\nHere in these brakes deep-wounded with a boar,\r\nDeep in the thigh, a spectacle of ruth!\r\nSee in my thigh,” quoth she, “here was the sore.”\r\n She showed hers: he saw more wounds than one,\r\n And blushing fled, and left her all alone.\r\n\nX\r\n\nSweet rose, fair flower, untimely pluck’d, soon vaded,\r\nPluck’d in the bud and vaded in the spring!\r\nBright orient pearl, alack, too timely shaded!\r\nFair creature, kill’d too soon by death’s sharp sting!\r\n Like a green plum that hangs upon a tree,\r\n And falls, through wind, before the fall should be.\r\n\r\nI weep for thee, and yet no cause I have;\r\nFor why thou left’st me nothing in thy will;\r\nAnd yet thou left’st me more than I did crave;\r\nFor why I craved nothing of thee still.\r\n O yes, dear friend, I pardon crave of thee,\r\n Thy discontent thou didst bequeath to me.\r\n\nXI\r\n\nVenus, with young Adonis sitting by her\r\nUnder a myrtle shade, began to woo him;\r\nShe told the youngling how god Mars did try her,\r\nAnd as he fell to her, she fell to him.\r\n“Even thus,” quoth she, “the warlike god embrac’d me,”\r\nAnd then she clipp’d Adonis in her arms;\r\n“Even thus,” quoth she, “the warlike god unlaced me;”\r\nAs if the boy should use like loving charms;\r\n“Even thus,” quoth she, “he seized on my lips,”\r\nAnd with her lips on his did act the seizure;\r\nAnd as she fetched breath, away he skips,\r\nAnd would not take her meaning nor her pleasure.\r\n Ah, that I had my lady at this bay,\r\n To kiss and clip me till I run away!\r\n\nXII\r\n\nCrabbed age and youth cannot live together:\r\nYouth is full of pleasance, age is full of care;\r\nYouth like summer morn, age like winter weather;\r\nYouth like summer brave, age like winter bare.\r\nYouth is full of sport, age’s breath is short;\r\n Youth is nimble, age is lame;\r\nYouth is hot and bold, age is weak and cold;\r\n Youth is wild, and age is tame.\r\nAge, I do abhor thee; youth, I do adore thee;\r\n O, my love, my love is young!\r\nAge, I do defy thee. O, sweet shepherd, hie thee,\r\nFor methinks thou stay’st too long.\r\n\nXIII\r\n\nBeauty is but a vain and doubtful good,\r\nA shining gloss that vadeth suddenly;\r\nA flower that dies when first it ’gins to bud;\r\nA brittle glass that’s broken presently:\r\n A doubtful good, a gloss, a glass, a flower,\r\n Lost, vaded, broken, dead within an hour.\r\n\r\nAnd as goods lost are seld or never found,\r\nAs vaded gloss no rubbing will refresh,\r\nAs flowers dead lie wither’d on the ground,\r\nAs broken glass no cement can redress,\r\n So beauty blemish’d once, for ever’s lost,\r\n In spite of physic, painting, pain and cost.\r\n\nXIV\r\n\nGood night, good rest. Ah, neither be my share:\r\nShe bade good night that kept my rest away;\r\nAnd daff’d me to a cabin hang’d with care,\r\nTo descant on the doubts of my decay.\r\n “Farewell,” quoth she, “and come again tomorrow:”\r\n Fare well I could not, for I supp’d with sorrow.\r\n\r\nYet at my parting sweetly did she smile,\r\nIn scorn or friendship, nill I conster whether:\r\n’T may be, she joy’d to jest at my exile,\r\n’T may be, again to make me wander thither:\r\n “Wander,” a word for shadows like myself,\r\n As take the pain, but cannot pluck the pelf.\r\n\r\nLord, how mine eyes throw gazes to the east!\r\nMy heart doth charge the watch; the morning rise\r\nDoth cite each moving sense from idle rest.\r\nNot daring trust the office of mine eyes,\r\n While Philomela sits and sings, I sit and mark,\r\n And wish her lays were tuned like the lark.\r\n\r\nFor she doth welcome daylight with her ditty,\r\nAnd drives away dark dreaming night.\r\nThe night so pack’d, I post unto my pretty;\r\nHeart hath his hope and eyes their wished sight;\r\n Sorrow chang’d to solace, solace mix’d with sorrow;\r\n For why, she sigh’d, and bade me come tomorrow.\r\n\r\nWere I with her, the night would post too soon;\r\nBut now are minutes added to the hours;\r\nTo spite me now, each minute seems a moon;\r\nYet not for me, shine sun to succour flowers!\r\n Pack night, peep day; good day, of night now borrow:\r\n Short, night, tonight, and length thyself tomorrow.\r\n\nXV\r\n\nIt was a lording’s daughter, the fairest one of three,\r\nThat liked of her master as well as well might be,\r\nTill looking on an Englishman, the fairest that eye could see,\r\n Her fancy fell a-turning.\r\nLong was the combat doubtful, that love with love did fight,\r\nTo leave the master loveless, or kill the gallant knight;\r\nTo put in practice either, alas, it was a spite\r\n Unto the silly damsel!\r\nBut one must be refused; more mickle was the pain,\r\nThat nothing could be used to turn them both to gain,\r\nFor of the two the trusty knight was wounded with disdain:\r\n Alas she could not help it!\r\nThus art with arms contending was victor of the day,\r\nWhich by a gift of learning did bear the maid away:\r\nThen lullaby, the learned man hath got the lady gay;\r\n For now my song is ended.\r\n\nXVI\r\n\nOn a day, alack the day!\r\nLove, whose month was ever May,\r\nSpied a blossom passing fair,\r\nPlaying in the wanton air.\r\nThrough the velvet leaves the wind\r\nAll unseen ’gan passage find,\r\nThat the lover, sick to death,\r\nWish’d himself the heaven’s breath:\r\n“Air,” quoth he, “thy cheeks may blow;\r\nAir, would I might triumph so!\r\nBut, alas, my hand hath sworn\r\nNe’er to pluck thee from thy thorn:\r\nVow, alack, for youth unmeet,\r\nYouth, so apt to pluck a sweet!\r\nThou for whom Jove would swear\r\nJuno but an Ethiope were,\r\nAnd deny himself for Jove,\r\nTurning mortal for thy love.”\r\n\nXVII\r\n\nMy flocks feed not, my ewes breed not,\r\nMy rams speed not, all is amis:\r\nLove is dying, faith’s defying,\r\nHeart’s denying, causer of this.\r\nAll my merry jigs are quite forgot,\r\nAll my lady’s love is lost, God wot:\r\nWhere her faith was firmely fix’d in love,\r\nThere a nay is plac’d without remove.\r\nOne silly cross wrought all my loss;\r\nO frowning fortune, cursed fickle dame!\r\nFor now I see inconstancy\r\nMore in women than in men remain.\r\n\r\nIn black mourn I, all fears scorn I,\r\nLove hath forlorn me, living in thrall.\r\nHeart is bleeding, all help needing,\r\nO cruel speeding, fraughted with gall.\r\nMy shepherd’s pipe can sound no deal.\r\nMy weather’s bell rings doleful knell;\r\nMy curtal dog that wont to have play’d,\r\nPlays not at all, but seems afraid.\r\nWith sighs so deep procures to weep,\r\nIn howling wise, to see my doleful plight.\r\nHow sighs resound through heartless ground,\r\nLike a thousand vanquish’d men in bloody fight!\r\n\r\nClear wells spring not, sweet birds sing not,\r\nGreen plants bring not forth their dye;\r\nHerds stands weeping, flocks all sleeping,\r\nNymphs black peeping fearfully.\r\nAll our pleasure known to us poor swains,\r\nAll our merry meetings on the plains,\r\nAll our evening sport from us is fled,\r\nAll our love is lost, for love is dead.\r\nFarewel, sweet love, thy like ne’er was\r\nFor a sweet content, the cause of all my woe!\r\nPoor Corydon must live alone;\r\nOther help for him I see that there is none.\r\n\nXVIII\r\n\nWhenas thine eye hath chose the dame,\r\nAnd stall’d the deer that thou shouldst strike,\r\nLet reason rule things worthy blame,\r\nAs well as fancy, partial might;\r\n Take counsel of some wiser head,\r\n Neither too young nor yet unwed.\r\n\r\nAnd when thou com’st thy tale to tell,\r\nSmooth not thy tongue with filed talk,\r\nLeast she some subtle practice smell,—\r\nA cripple soon can find a halt,—\r\n But plainly say thou lov’st her well,\r\n And set her person forth to sale.\r\n\r\nWhat though her frowning brows be bent,\r\nHer cloudy looks will calm ere night,\r\nAnd then too late she will repent,\r\nThat thus dissembled her delight;\r\n And twice desire, ere it be day,\r\n That which with scorn she put away.\r\n\r\nWhat though she strive to try her strength,\r\nAnd ban and brawl, and say thee nay,\r\nHer feeble force will yield at length,\r\nWhen craft hath taught her thus to say:\r\n “Had women been so strong as men,\r\n In faith, you had not had it then.”\r\n\r\nAnd to her will frame all thy ways;\r\nSpare not to spend, and chiefly there\r\nWhere thy desert may merit praise,\r\nBy ringing in thy lady’s ear:\r\n The strongest castle, tower and town,\r\n The golden bullet beats it down.\r\n\r\nServe always with assured trust,\r\nAnd in thy suit be humble true;\r\nUnless thy lady prove unjust,\r\nPress never thou to choose a new:\r\n When time shall serve, be thou not slack,\r\n To proffer, though she put thee back.\r\n\r\nThe wiles and guiles that women work,\r\nDissembled with an outward show,\r\nThe tricks and toys that in them lurk,\r\nThe cock that treads them shall not know,\r\n Have you not heard it said full oft,\r\n A woman’s nay doth stand for nought.\r\n\r\nThink women still to strive with men,\r\nTo sin and never for to saint:\r\nThere is no heaven, by holy then,\r\nWhen time with age shall them attaint,\r\n Were kisses all the joys in bed,\r\n One woman would another wed.\r\n\r\nBut soft, enough,—too much,—I fear\r\nLest that my mistress hear my song:\r\nShe will not stick to round me on th’ ear,\r\nTo teach my tongue to be so long.\r\n Yet will she blush, here be it said,\r\n To hear her secrets so bewray’d.\r\n\nXIX\r\n\nLive with me and be my love,\r\nAnd we will all the pleasures prove\r\nThat hills and valleys, dales and fields,\r\nAnd all the craggy mountains yield.\r\n\r\nThere will we sit upon the rocks,\r\nAnd see the shepherds feed their flocks,\r\nBy shallow rivers, by whose falls\r\nMelodious birds sing madrigals.\r\n\r\nThere will I make thee a bed of roses,\r\nWith a thousand fragrant posies,\r\nA cap of flowers, and a kirtle\r\nEmbroidered all with leaves of myrtle.\r\n\r\nA belt of straw and ivy buds,\r\nWith coral clasps and amber studs;\r\nAnd if these pleasures may thee move,\r\nThen live with me and be my love.\r\n\r\nLove’s Answer.\r\n\r\nIf that the world and love were young,\r\nAnd truth in every shepherd’s tongue,\r\nThese pretty pleasures might me move\r\nTo live with thee and be thy love.\r\n\nXX\r\n\nAs it fell upon a day\r\nIn the merry month of May,\r\nSitting in a pleasant shade\r\nWhich a grove of myrtles made,\r\nBeasts did leap and birds did sing,\r\nTrees did grow and plants did spring;\r\nEverything did banish moan,\r\nSave the nightingale alone:\r\nShe, poor bird, as all forlorn,\r\nLean’d her breast up-till a thorn,\r\nAnd there sung the dolefull’st ditty,\r\nThat to hear it was great pitty.\r\n“Fie, fie, fie,” now would she cry,\r\n“Tereu, Tereu,” by and by;\r\n\r\nThat to hear her so complain,\r\nScarce I could from tears refrain,\r\nFor her griefs so lively shown\r\nMade me think upon mine own.\r\nAh, thought I, thou mourn’st in vain!\r\nNone takes pitty on thy pain.\r\nSenseless trees they cannot hear thee,\r\nRuthless bears they will not cheer thee;\r\nKing Pandion he is dead,\r\nAll thy friends are lapp’d in lead,\r\nAll thy fellow birds do sing,\r\nCareless of thy sorrowing.\r\n\r\nWhilst as fickle fortune smiled,\r\nThou and I were both beguiled.\r\nEvery one that flatters thee\r\nIs no friend in misery.\r\nWords are easy, like the wind;\r\nFaithful friends are hard to find.\r\nEvery man will be thy friend\r\nWhilst thou hast wherewith to spend;\r\nBut if store of crowns be scant,\r\nNo man will supply thy want.\r\nIf that one be prodigal,\r\nBountiful they will him call,\r\nAnd with such-like flattering,\r\n“Pity but he were a king.”\r\n\r\nIf he be addict to vice,\r\nQuickly him they will entice;\r\nIf to women he be bent,\r\nThey have at commandement.\r\nBut if Fortune once do frown,\r\nThen farewell his great renown.\r\nThey that fawn’d on him before,\r\nUse his company no more.\r\nHe that is thy friend indeed,\r\nHe will help thee in thy need:\r\nIf thou sorrow, he will weep;\r\nIf thou wake, he cannot sleep.\r\nThus of every grief in heart\r\nHe with thee doth bear a part.\r\nThese are certain signs to know\r\nFaithful friend from flatt’ring foe.\r\n\nTHE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE\r\n\nLet the bird of loudest lay,\r\nOn the sole Arabian tree,\r\nHerald sad and trumpet be,\r\nTo whose sound chaste wings obey.\r\n\r\nBut thou shrieking harbinger,\r\nFoul precurrer of the fiend,\r\nAugur of the fever’s end,\r\nTo this troop come thou not near.\r\n\r\nFrom this session interdict\r\nEvery fowl of tyrant wing,\r\nSave the eagle, feather’d king;\r\nKeep the obsequy so strict.\r\n\r\nLet the priest in surplice white,\r\nThat defunctive music can,\r\nBe the death-divining swan,\r\nLest the requiem lack his right.\r\n\r\nAnd thou treble-dated crow,\r\nThat thy sable gender mak’st\r\nWith the breath thou giv’st and tak’st,\r\n’Mongst our mourners shalt thou go.\r\n\r\nHere the anthem doth commence:\r\nLove and constancy is dead;\r\nPhoenix and the turtle fled\r\nIn a mutual flame from hence.\r\n\r\nSo they lov’d, as love in twain\r\nHad the essence but in one;\r\nTwo distincts, division none:\r\nNumber there in love was slain.\r\n\r\nHearts remote, yet not asunder;\r\nDistance and no space was seen\r\n’Twixt this turtle and his queen;\r\nBut in them it were a wonder.\r\n\r\nSo between them love did shine,\r\nThat the turtle saw his right\r\nFlaming in the phoenix’ sight;\r\nEither was the other’s mine.\r\n\r\nProperty was thus appalled,\r\nThat the self was not the same;\r\nSingle nature’s double name\r\nNeither two nor one was called.\r\n\r\nReason, in itself confounded,\r\nSaw division grow together;\r\nTo themselves yet either neither,\r\nSimple were so well compounded.\r\n\r\nThat it cried, How true a twain\r\nSeemeth this concordant one!\r\nLove hath reason, reason none,\r\nIf what parts can so remain.\r\n\r\nWhereupon it made this threne\r\nTo the phoenix and the dove,\r\nCo-supremes and stars of love,\r\nAs chorus to their tragic scene.\r\n\n THRENOS\r\n\r\nBeauty, truth, and rarity.\r\nGrace in all simplicity,\r\nHere enclos’d in cinders lie.\r\n\r\nDeath is now the phoenix’ nest;\r\nAnd the turtle’s loyal breast\r\nTo eternity doth rest.\r\n\r\nLeaving no posterity:—\r\n’Twas not their infirmity,\r\nIt was married chastity.\r\n\r\nTruth may seem, but cannot be;\r\nBeauty brag, but ’tis not she;\r\nTruth and beauty buried be.\r\n\r\nTo this urn let those repair\r\nThat are either true or fair;\r\nFor these dead birds sigh a prayer.\r\n\nTHE RAPE OF LUCRECE\r\n\nTO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE\r\nHENRY WRIOTHESLEY, EARL OF SOUTHAMPTON,\r\nand Baron of Titchfield.\r\n\r\nThe love I dedicate to your Lordship is without end; whereof this\r\npamphlet, without beginning, is but a superfluous moiety. The warrant I\r\nhave of your honourable disposition, not the worth of my untutored\r\nlines, makes it assured of acceptance. What I have done is yours; what\r\nI have to do is yours; being part in all I have, devoted yours. Were my\r\nworth greater, my duty would show greater; meantime, as it is, it is\r\nbound to your Lordship, to whom I wish long life, still lengthened with\r\nall happiness.\r\n\r\n Your Lordship’s in all duty,\r\n WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\nTHE ARGUMENT.\r\n\nLucius Tarquinius (for his excessive pride surnamed Superbus), after he\r\nhad caused his own father-in-law, Servius Tullius, to be cruelly\r\nmurdered, and, contrary to the Roman laws and customs, not requiring or\r\nstaying for the people’s suffrages, had possessed himself of the\r\nkingdom, went, accompanied with his sons and other noblemen of Rome, to\r\nbesiege Ardea. During which siege the principal men of the army meeting\r\none evening at the tent of Sextus Tarquinius, the king’s son, in their\r\ndiscourses after supper, everyone commended the virtues of his own\r\nwife; among whom Collatinus extolled the incomparable chastity of his\r\nwife Lucretia. In that pleasant humour they all posted to Rome; and\r\nintending, by their secret and sudden arrival, to make trial of that\r\nwhich everyone had before avouched, only Collatinus finds his wife,\r\nthough it were late in the night, spinning amongst her maids: the other\r\nladies were all found dancing and revelling, or in several disports.\r\nWhereupon the noblemen yielded Collatinus the victory, and his wife the\r\nfame. At that time Sextus Tarquinius being inflamed with Lucrece’s\r\nbeauty, yet smothering his passions for the present, departed with the\r\nrest back to the camp; from whence he shortly after privily withdrew\r\nhimself, and was (according to his estate) royally entertained and\r\nlodged by Lucrece at Collatium. The same night he treacherously\r\nstealeth into her chamber, violently ravished her, and early in the\r\nmorning speedeth away. Lucrece, in this lamentable plight, hastily\r\ndispatched messengers, one to Rome for her father, another to the camp\r\nfor Collatine. They came, the one accompanied with Junius Brutus, the\r\nother with Publius Valerius; and finding Lucrece attired in mourning\r\nhabit, demanded the cause of her sorrow. She, first taking an oath of\r\nthem for her revenge, revealed the actor, and whole manner of his\r\ndealing, and withal suddenly stabbed herself. Which done, with one\r\nconsent they all vowed to root out the whole hated family of the\r\nTarquins; and bearing the dead body to Rome, Brutus acquainted the\r\npeople with the doer and manner of the vile deed, with a bitter\r\ninvective against the tyranny of the king; wherewith the people were so\r\nmoved, that with one consent and a general acclamation the Tarquins\r\nwere all exiled, and the state government changed from kings to\r\nconsuls.\r\n\nFrom the besieged Ardea all in post,\r\nBorne by the trustless wings of false desire,\r\nLust-breathed Tarquin leaves the Roman host,\r\nAnd to Collatium bears the lightless fire,\r\nWhich in pale embers hid, lurks to aspire\r\n And girdle with embracing flames the waist\r\n Of Collatine’s fair love, Lucrece the chaste.\r\n\r\nHaply that name of “chaste” unhapp’ly set\r\nThis bateless edge on his keen appetite,\r\nWhen Collatine unwisely did not let\r\nTo praise the clear unmatched red and white\r\nWhich triumphed in that sky of his delight;\r\n Where mortal stars as bright as heaven’s beauties,\r\n With pure aspects did him peculiar duties.\r\n\r\nFor he the night before, in Tarquin’s tent\r\nUnlocked the treasure of his happy state,\r\nWhat priceless wealth the heavens had him lent\r\nIn the possession of his beauteous mate;\r\nReck’ning his fortune at such high proud rate\r\n That kings might be espoused to more fame,\r\n But king nor peer to such a peerless dame.\r\n\r\nO happiness enjoyed but of a few,\r\nAnd, if possessed, as soon decayed and done\r\nAs is the morning’s silver melting dew\r\nAgainst the golden splendour of the sun!\r\nAn expired date, cancelled ere well begun.\r\n Honour and beauty in the owner’s arms,\r\n Are weakly fortressed from a world of harms.\r\n\r\nBeauty itself doth of itself persuade\r\nThe eyes of men without an orator;\r\nWhat needeth then apologies be made,\r\nTo set forth that which is so singular?\r\nOr why is Collatine the publisher\r\n Of that rich jewel he should keep unknown\r\n From thievish ears, because it is his own?\r\n\r\nPerchance his boast of Lucrece’ sov’reignty\r\nSuggested this proud issue of a king;\r\nFor by our ears our hearts oft tainted be.\r\nPerchance that envy of so rich a thing,\r\nBraving compare, disdainfully did sting\r\n His high-pitched thoughts, that meaner men should vaunt\r\n That golden hap which their superiors want.\r\n\r\nBut some untimely thought did instigate\r\nHis all-too-timeless speed, if none of those;\r\nHis honour, his affairs, his friends, his state,\r\nNeglected all, with swift intent he goes\r\nTo quench the coal which in his liver glows.\r\n O rash false heat, wrapped in repentant cold,\r\n Thy hasty spring still blasts and ne’er grows old!\r\n\r\nWhen at Collatium this false lord arrived,\r\nWell was he welcomed by the Roman dame,\r\nWithin whose face beauty and virtue strived\r\nWhich of them both should underprop her fame.\r\nWhen virtue bragged, beauty would blush for shame;\r\n When beauty boasted blushes, in despite\r\n Virtue would stain that o’er with silver white.\r\n\r\nBut beauty, in that white intituled\r\nFrom Venus’ doves, doth challenge that fair field.\r\nThen virtue claims from beauty beauty’s red,\r\nWhich virtue gave the golden age to gild\r\nTheir silver cheeks, and called it then their shield;\r\n Teaching them thus to use it in the fight,\r\n When shame assailed, the red should fence the white.\r\n\r\nThis heraldry in Lucrece’ face was seen,\r\nArgued by beauty’s red and virtue’s white.\r\nOf either’s colour was the other queen,\r\nProving from world’s minority their right.\r\nYet their ambition makes them still to fight;\r\n The sovereignty of either being so great,\r\n That oft they interchange each other’s seat.\r\n\r\nTheir silent war of lilies and of roses,\r\nWhich Tarquin viewed in her fair face’s field,\r\nIn their pure ranks his traitor eye encloses;\r\nWhere, lest between them both it should be killed,\r\nThe coward captive vanquished doth yield\r\n To those two armies that would let him go\r\n Rather than triumph in so false a foe.\r\n\r\nNow thinks he that her husband’s shallow tongue,\r\nThe niggard prodigal that praised her so,\r\nIn that high task hath done her beauty wrong,\r\nWhich far exceeds his barren skill to show.\r\nTherefore that praise which Collatine doth owe\r\n Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise,\r\n In silent wonder of still-gazing eyes.\r\n\r\nThis earthly saint, adored by this devil,\r\nLittle suspecteth the false worshipper;\r\nFor unstained thoughts do seldom dream on evil;\r\nBirds never limed no secret bushes fear.\r\nSo guiltless she securely gives good cheer\r\n And reverend welcome to her princely guest,\r\n Whose inward ill no outward harm expressed.\r\n\r\nFor that he coloured with his high estate,\r\nHiding base sin in pleats of majesty,\r\nThat nothing in him seemed inordinate,\r\nSave sometime too much wonder of his eye,\r\nWhich, having all, all could not satisfy;\r\n But, poorly rich, so wanteth in his store\r\n That, cloyed with much, he pineth still for more.\r\n\r\nBut she, that never coped with stranger eyes,\r\nCould pick no meaning from their parling looks,\r\nNor read the subtle shining secrecies\r\nWrit in the glassy margents of such books;\r\nShe touched no unknown baits, nor feared no hooks,\r\n Nor could she moralize his wanton sight,\r\n More than his eyes were opened to the light.\r\n\r\nHe stories to her ears her husband’s fame,\r\nWon in the fields of fruitful Italy;\r\nAnd decks with praises Collatine’s high name,\r\nMade glorious by his manly chivalry\r\nWith bruised arms and wreaths of victory.\r\n Her joy with heaved-up hand she doth express,\r\n And, wordless, so greets heaven for his success.\r\n\r\nFar from the purpose of his coming thither,\r\nHe makes excuses for his being there.\r\nNo cloudy show of stormy blust’ring weather\r\nDoth yet in his fair welkin once appear,\r\nTill sable Night, mother of dread and fear,\r\n Upon the world dim darkness doth display,\r\n And in her vaulty prison stows the day.\r\n\r\nFor then is Tarquin brought unto his bed,\r\nIntending weariness with heavy sprite;\r\nFor after supper long he questioned\r\nWith modest Lucrece, and wore out the night.\r\nNow leaden slumber with life’s strength doth fight,\r\n And every one to rest themselves betake,\r\n Save thieves and cares and troubled minds that wake.\r\n\r\nAs one of which doth Tarquin lie revolving\r\nThe sundry dangers of his will’s obtaining,\r\nYet ever to obtain his will resolving,\r\nThough weak-built hopes persuade him to abstaining.\r\nDespair to gain doth traffic oft for gaining,\r\n And when great treasure is the meed proposed,\r\n Though death be adjunct, there’s no death supposed.\r\n\r\nThose that much covet are with gain so fond\r\nFor what they have not, that which they possess\r\nThey scatter and unloose it from their bond;\r\nAnd so, by hoping more, they have but less,\r\nOr, gaining more, the profit of excess\r\n Is but to surfeit, and such griefs sustain,\r\n That they prove bankrout in this poor-rich gain.\r\n\r\nThe aim of all is but to nurse the life\r\nWith honour, wealth, and ease, in waning age;\r\nAnd in this aim there is such thwarting strife\r\nThat one for all or all for one we gage:\r\nAs life for honour in fell battle’s rage,\r\n Honour for wealth; and oft that wealth doth cost\r\n The death of all, and all together lost.\r\n\r\nSo that in vent’ring ill we leave to be\r\nThe things we are, for that which we expect;\r\nAnd this ambitious foul infirmity,\r\nIn having much, torments us with defect\r\nOf that we have. So then we do neglect\r\n The thing we have, and, all for want of wit,\r\n Make something nothing by augmenting it.\r\n\r\nSuch hazard now must doting Tarquin make,\r\nPawning his honour to obtain his lust;\r\nAnd for himself himself he must forsake.\r\nThen where is truth, if there be no self-trust?\r\nWhen shall he think to find a stranger just,\r\n When he himself himself confounds, betrays\r\n To sland’rous tongues and wretched hateful days?\r\n\r\nNow stole upon the time the dead of night,\r\nWhen heavy sleep had closed up mortal eyes.\r\nNo comfortable star did lend his light,\r\nNo noise but owls’ and wolves’ death-boding cries;\r\nNow serves the season that they may surprise\r\n The silly lambs. Pure thoughts are dead and still,\r\n While lust and murder wake to stain and kill.\r\n\r\nAnd now this lustful lord leaped from his bed,\r\nThrowing his mantle rudely o’er his arm;\r\nIs madly tossed between desire and dread;\r\nTh’ one sweetly flatters, th’ other feareth harm.\r\nBut honest fear, bewitched with lust’s foul charm,\r\n Doth too too oft betake him to retire,\r\n Beaten away by brain-sick rude desire.\r\n\r\nHis falchion on a flint he softly smiteth,\r\nThat from the cold stone sparks of fire do fly;\r\nWhereat a waxen torch forthwith he lighteth,\r\nWhich must be lodestar to his lustful eye,\r\nAnd to the flame thus speaks advisedly:\r\n “As from this cold flint I enforced this fire,\r\n So Lucrece must I force to my desire.”\r\n\r\nHere pale with fear he doth premeditate\r\nThe dangers of his loathsome enterprise,\r\nAnd in his inward mind he doth debate\r\nWhat following sorrow may on this arise.\r\nThen looking scornfully, he doth despise\r\n His naked armour of still-slaughtered lust,\r\n And justly thus controls his thoughts unjust:\r\n\r\n“Fair torch, burn out thy light, and lend it not\r\nTo darken her whose light excelleth thine.\r\nAnd die, unhallowed thoughts, before you blot\r\nWith your uncleanness that which is divine.\r\nOffer pure incense to so pure a shrine.\r\n Let fair humanity abhor the deed\r\n That spots and stains love’s modest snow-white weed.\r\n\r\n“O shame to knighthood and to shining arms!\r\nO foul dishonour to my household’s grave!\r\nO impious act including all foul harms!\r\nA martial man to be soft fancy’s slave!\r\nTrue valour still a true respect should have.\r\n Then my digression is so vile, so base,\r\n That it will live engraven in my face.\r\n\r\n“Yea, though I die, the scandal will survive\r\nAnd be an eye-sore in my golden coat;\r\nSome loathsome dash the herald will contrive,\r\nTo cipher me how fondly I did dote,\r\nThat my posterity, shamed with the note,\r\n Shall curse my bones, and hold it for no sin\r\n To wish that I their father had not been.\r\n\r\n“What win I if I gain the thing I seek?\r\nA dream, a breath, a froth of fleeting joy.\r\nWho buys a minute’s mirth to wail a week,\r\nOr sells eternity to get a toy?\r\nFor one sweet grape who will the vine destroy?\r\n Or what fond beggar, but to touch the crown,\r\n Would with the sceptre straight be strucken down?\r\n\r\n“If Collatinus dream of my intent,\r\nWill he not wake, and in a desp’rate rage\r\nPost hither, this vile purpose to prevent?—\r\nThis siege that hath engirt his marriage,\r\nThis blur to youth, this sorrow to the sage,\r\n This dying virtue, this surviving shame,\r\n Whose crime will bear an ever-during blame?\r\n\r\n“O, what excuse can my invention make\r\nWhen thou shalt charge me with so black a deed?\r\nWill not my tongue be mute, my frail joints shake,\r\nMine eyes forgo their light, my false heart bleed?\r\nThe guilt being great, the fear doth still exceed;\r\n And extreme fear can neither fight nor fly,\r\n But coward-like with trembling terror die.\r\n\r\n“Had Collatinus killed my son or sire,\r\nOr lain in ambush to betray my life,\r\nOr were he not my dear friend, this desire\r\nMight have excuse to work upon his wife,\r\nAs in revenge or quittal of such strife;\r\n But as he is my kinsman, my dear friend,\r\n The shame and fault finds no excuse nor end.\r\n\r\n“Shameful it is; ay, if the fact be known.\r\nHateful it is, there is no hate in loving.\r\nI’ll beg her love. But she is not her own.\r\nThe worst is but denial and reproving.\r\nMy will is strong, past reason’s weak removing.\r\n Who fears a sentence or an old man’s saw\r\n Shall by a painted cloth be kept in awe.”\r\n\r\nThus, graceless, holds he disputation\r\n’Tween frozen conscience and hot-burning will,\r\nAnd with good thoughts makes dispensation,\r\nUrging the worser sense for vantage still;\r\nWhich in a moment doth confound and kill\r\n All pure effects, and doth so far proceed\r\n That what is vile shows like a virtuous deed.\r\n\r\nQuoth he, “She took me kindly by the hand,\r\nAnd gazed for tidings in my eager eyes,\r\nFearing some hard news from the warlike band\r\nWhere her beloved Collatinus lies.\r\nO how her fear did make her colour rise!\r\n First red as roses that on lawn we lay,\r\n Then white as lawn, the roses took away.\r\n\r\n“And how her hand, in my hand being locked,\r\nForced it to tremble with her loyal fear,\r\nWhich struck her sad, and then it faster rocked,\r\nUntil her husband’s welfare she did hear;\r\nWhereat she smiled with so sweet a cheer\r\n That had Narcissus seen her as she stood,\r\n Self-love had never drowned him in the flood.\r\n\r\n“Why hunt I then for colour or excuses?\r\nAll orators are dumb when beauty pleadeth.\r\nPoor wretches have remorse in poor abuses;\r\nLove thrives not in the heart that shadows dreadeth.\r\nAffection is my captain, and he leadeth;\r\n And when his gaudy banner is displayed,\r\n The coward fights and will not be dismayed.\r\n\r\n“Then, childish fear, avaunt! Debating, die!\r\nRespect and reason wait on wrinkled age!\r\nMy heart shall never countermand mine eye.\r\nSad pause and deep regard beseems the sage;\r\nMy part is youth, and beats these from the stage.\r\n Desire my pilot is, beauty my prize;\r\n Then who fears sinking where such treasure lies?”\r\n\r\nAs corn o’ergrown by weeds, so heedful fear\r\nIs almost choked by unresisted lust.\r\nAway he steals with opening, list’ning ear,\r\nFull of foul hope, and full of fond mistrust;\r\nBoth which, as servitors to the unjust,\r\n So cross him with their opposite persuasion\r\n That now he vows a league, and now invasion.\r\n\r\nWithin his thought her heavenly image sits,\r\nAnd in the self-same seat sits Collatine.\r\nThat eye which looks on her confounds his wits;\r\nThat eye which him beholds, as more divine,\r\nUnto a view so false will not incline,\r\n But with a pure appeal seeks to the heart,\r\n Which once corrupted takes the worser part;\r\n\r\nAnd therein heartens up his servile powers,\r\nWho, flattered by their leader’s jocund show,\r\nStuff up his lust, as minutes fill up hours;\r\nAnd as their captain, so their pride doth grow,\r\nPaying more slavish tribute than they owe.\r\n By reprobate desire thus madly led,\r\n The Roman lord marcheth to Lucrece’ bed.\r\n\r\nThe locks between her chamber and his will,\r\nEach one by him enforced, retires his ward;\r\nBut, as they open, they all rate his ill,\r\nWhich drives the creeping thief to some regard.\r\nThe threshold grates the door to have him heard;\r\n Night-wand’ring weasels shriek to see him there;\r\n They fright him, yet he still pursues his fear.\r\n\r\nAs each unwilling portal yields him way,\r\nThrough little vents and crannies of the place\r\nThe wind wars with his torch, to make him stay,\r\nAnd blows the smoke of it into his face,\r\nExtinguishing his conduct in this case;\r\n But his hot heart, which fond desire doth scorch,\r\n Puffs forth another wind that fires the torch.\r\n\r\nAnd being lighted, by the light he spies\r\nLucretia’s glove, wherein her needle sticks;\r\nHe takes it from the rushes where it lies,\r\nAnd griping it, the needle his finger pricks,\r\nAs who should say, “This glove to wanton tricks\r\n Is not inured. Return again in haste;\r\n Thou seest our mistress’ ornaments are chaste.”\r\n\r\nBut all these poor forbiddings could not stay him;\r\nHe in the worst sense construes their denial.\r\nThe doors, the wind, the glove that did delay him,\r\nHe takes for accidental things of trial;\r\nOr as those bars which stop the hourly dial,\r\n Who with a ling’ring stay his course doth let,\r\n Till every minute pays the hour his debt.\r\n\r\n“So, so,” quoth he, “these lets attend the time,\r\nLike little frosts that sometime threat the spring,\r\nTo add a more rejoicing to the prime,\r\nAnd give the sneaped birds more cause to sing.\r\nPain pays the income of each precious thing:\r\n Huge rocks, high winds, strong pirates, shelves and sands\r\n The merchant fears, ere rich at home he lands.”\r\n\r\nNow is he come unto the chamber door\r\nThat shuts him from the heaven of his thought,\r\nWhich with a yielding latch, and with no more,\r\nHath barred him from the blessed thing he sought.\r\nSo from himself impiety hath wrought,\r\n That for his prey to pray he doth begin,\r\n As if the heavens should countenance his sin.\r\n\r\nBut in the midst of his unfruitful prayer,\r\nHaving solicited th’ eternal power\r\nThat his foul thoughts might compass his fair fair,\r\nAnd they would stand auspicious to the hour,\r\nEven there he starts. Quoth he, “I must deflower.\r\n The powers to whom I pray abhor this fact,\r\n How can they then assist me in the act?\r\n\r\n“Then Love and Fortune be my gods, my guide!\r\nMy will is backed with resolution.\r\nThoughts are but dreams till their effects be tried;\r\nThe blackest sin is cleared with absolution.\r\nAgainst love’s fire fear’s frost hath dissolution.\r\n The eye of heaven is out, and misty night\r\n Covers the shame that follows sweet delight.”\r\n\r\nThis said, his guilty hand plucked up the latch,\r\nAnd with his knee the door he opens wide.\r\nThe dove sleeps fast that this night-owl will catch;\r\nThus treason works ere traitors be espied.\r\nWho sees the lurking serpent steps aside;\r\n But she, sound sleeping, fearing no such thing,\r\n Lies at the mercy of his mortal sting.\r\n\r\nInto the chamber wickedly he stalks,\r\nAnd gazeth on her yet unstained bed.\r\nThe curtains being close, about he walks,\r\nRolling his greedy eyeballs in his head.\r\nBy their high treason is his heart misled,\r\n Which gives the watch-word to his hand full soon\r\n To draw the cloud that hides the silver moon.\r\n\r\nLook as the fair and fiery-pointed sun,\r\nRushing from forth a cloud, bereaves our sight;\r\nEven so, the curtain drawn, his eyes begun\r\nTo wink, being blinded with a greater light.\r\nWhether it is that she reflects so bright,\r\n That dazzleth them, or else some shame supposed;\r\n But blind they are, and keep themselves enclosed.\r\n\r\nO, had they in that darksome prison died,\r\nThen had they seen the period of their ill!\r\nThen Collatine again by Lucrece’ side\r\nIn his clear bed might have reposed still.\r\nBut they must ope, this blessed league to kill;\r\n And holy-thoughted Lucrece to their sight\r\n Must sell her joy, her life, her world’s delight.\r\n\r\nHer lily hand her rosy cheek lies under,\r\nCoz’ning the pillow of a lawful kiss;\r\nWho, therefore angry, seems to part in sunder,\r\nSwelling on either side to want his bliss;\r\nBetween whose hills her head entombed is,\r\n Where like a virtuous monument she lies,\r\n To be admired of lewd unhallowed eyes.\r\n\r\nWithout the bed her other fair hand was,\r\nOn the green coverlet; whose perfect white\r\nShowed like an April daisy on the grass,\r\nWith pearly sweat resembling dew of night.\r\nHer eyes, like marigolds, had sheathed their light,\r\n And canopied in darkness sweetly lay,\r\n Till they might open to adorn the day.\r\n\r\nHer hair, like golden threads, played with her breath:\r\nO modest wantons, wanton modesty!\r\nShowing life’s triumph in the map of death,\r\nAnd death’s dim look in life’s mortality.\r\nEach in her sleep themselves so beautify,\r\n As if between them twain there were no strife,\r\n But that life lived in death and death in life.\r\n\r\nHer breasts like ivory globes circled with blue,\r\nA pair of maiden worlds unconquered,\r\nSave of their lord no bearing yoke they knew,\r\nAnd him by oath they truly honoured.\r\nThese worlds in Tarquin new ambition bred;\r\n Who, like a foul usurper, went about\r\n From this fair throne to heave the owner out.\r\n\r\nWhat could he see but mightily he noted?\r\nWhat did he note but strongly he desired?\r\nWhat he beheld, on that he firmly doted,\r\nAnd in his will his wilful eye he tired.\r\nWith more than admiration he admired\r\n Her azure veins, her alabaster skin,\r\n Her coral lips, her snow-white dimpled chin.\r\n\r\nAs the grim lion fawneth o’er his prey,\r\nSharp hunger by the conquest satisfied,\r\nSo o’er this sleeping soul doth Tarquin stay,\r\nHis rage of lust by grazing qualified—\r\nSlaked, not suppressed; for standing by her side,\r\n His eye, which late this mutiny restrains,\r\n Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins.\r\n\r\nAnd they, like straggling slaves for pillage fighting,\r\nObdurate vassals fell exploits effecting,\r\nIn bloody death and ravishment delighting,\r\nNor children’s tears nor mothers’ groans respecting,\r\nSwell in their pride, the onset still expecting.\r\n Anon his beating heart, alarum striking,\r\n Gives the hot charge and bids them do their liking.\r\n\r\nHis drumming heart cheers up his burning eye,\r\nHis eye commends the leading to his hand;\r\nHis hand, as proud of such a dignity,\r\nSmoking with pride, marched on to make his stand\r\nOn her bare breast, the heart of all her land;\r\n Whose ranks of blue veins, as his hand did scale,\r\n Left their round turrets destitute and pale.\r\n\r\nThey, must’ring to the quiet cabinet\r\nWhere their dear governess and lady lies,\r\nDo tell her she is dreadfully beset,\r\nAnd fright her with confusion of their cries.\r\nShe, much amazed, breaks ope her locked-up eyes,\r\n Who, peeping forth this tumult to behold,\r\n Are by his flaming torch dimmed and controlled.\r\n\r\nImagine her as one in dead of night\r\nFrom forth dull sleep by dreadful fancy waking,\r\nThat thinks she hath beheld some ghastly sprite,\r\nWhose grim aspect sets every joint a shaking.\r\nWhat terror ’tis! but she, in worser taking,\r\n From sleep disturbed, heedfully doth view\r\n The sight which makes supposed terror true.\r\n\r\nWrapped and confounded in a thousand fears,\r\nLike to a new-killed bird she trembling lies.\r\nShe dares not look; yet, winking, there appears\r\nQuick-shifting antics, ugly in her eyes.\r\nSuch shadows are the weak brain’s forgeries;\r\n Who, angry that the eyes fly from their lights,\r\n In darkness daunts them with more dreadful sights.\r\n\r\nHis hand, that yet remains upon her breast,\r\nRude ram, to batter such an ivory wall!\r\nMay feel her heart, poor citizen, distressed,\r\nWounding itself to death, rise up and fall,\r\nBeating her bulk, that his hand shakes withal.\r\n This moves in him more rage, and lesser pity,\r\n To make the breach and enter this sweet city.\r\n\r\nFirst, like a trumpet doth his tongue begin\r\nTo sound a parley to his heartless foe,\r\nWho o’er the white sheet peers her whiter chin,\r\nThe reason of this rash alarm to know,\r\nWhich he by dumb demeanour seeks to show;\r\n But she with vehement prayers urgeth still\r\n Under what colour he commits this ill.\r\n\r\nThus he replies: “The colour in thy face,\r\nThat even for anger makes the lily pale,\r\nAnd the red rose blush at her own disgrace,\r\nShall plead for me and tell my loving tale.\r\nUnder that colour am I come to scale\r\n Thy never-conquered fort; the fault is thine,\r\n For those thine eyes betray thee unto mine.\r\n\r\n“Thus I forestall thee, if thou mean to chide:\r\nThy beauty hath ensnared thee to this night,\r\nWhere thou with patience must my will abide,\r\nMy will that marks thee for my earth’s delight,\r\nWhich I to conquer sought with all my might.\r\n But as reproof and reason beat it dead,\r\n By thy bright beauty was it newly bred.\r\n\r\n“I see what crosses my attempt will bring;\r\nI know what thorns the growing rose defends;\r\nI think the honey guarded with a sting;\r\nAll this beforehand counsel comprehends.\r\nBut will is deaf, and hears no heedful friends;\r\n Only he hath an eye to gaze on beauty,\r\n And dotes on what he looks, ’gainst law or duty.\r\n\r\n“I have debated, even in my soul,\r\nWhat wrong, what shame, what sorrow I shall breed;\r\nBut nothing can affection’s course control,\r\nOr stop the headlong fury of his speed.\r\nI know repentant tears ensue the deed,\r\n Reproach, disdain, and deadly enmity;\r\n Yet strike I to embrace mine infamy.”\r\n\r\nThis said, he shakes aloft his Roman blade,\r\nWhich, like a falcon tow’ring in the skies,\r\nCoucheth the fowl below with his wings’ shade,\r\nWhose crooked beak threats, if he mount he dies.\r\nSo under his insulting falchion lies\r\n Harmless Lucretia, marking what he tells\r\n With trembling fear, as fowl hear falcon’s bells.\r\n\r\n“Lucrece,” quoth he, “this night I must enjoy thee.\r\nIf thou deny, then force must work my way,\r\nFor in thy bed I purpose to destroy thee;\r\nThat done, some worthless slave of thine I’ll slay.\r\nTo kill thine honour with thy life’s decay;\r\n And in thy dead arms do I mean to place him,\r\n Swearing I slew him, seeing thee embrace him.\r\n\r\n“So thy surviving husband shall remain\r\nThe scornful mark of every open eye;\r\nThy kinsmen hang their heads at this disdain,\r\nThy issue blurred with nameless bastardy.\r\nAnd thou, the author of their obloquy,\r\n Shalt have thy trespass cited up in rhymes\r\n And sung by children in succeeding times.\r\n\r\n“But if thou yield, I rest thy secret friend.\r\nThe fault unknown is as a thought unacted;\r\nA little harm done to a great good end\r\nFor lawful policy remains enacted.\r\nThe poisonous simple sometimes is compacted\r\n In a pure compound; being so applied,\r\n His venom in effect is purified.\r\n\r\n“Then, for thy husband and thy children’s sake,\r\nTender my suit. Bequeath not to their lot\r\nThe shame that from them no device can take,\r\nThe blemish that will never be forgot,\r\nWorse than a slavish wipe, or birth-hour’s blot:\r\n For marks descried in men’s nativity\r\n Are nature’s faults, not their own infamy.”\r\n\r\nHere with a cockatrice’ dead-killing eye\r\nHe rouseth up himself and makes a pause;\r\nWhile she, the picture of pure piety,\r\nLike a white hind under the gripe’s sharp claws,\r\nPleads in a wilderness where are no laws,\r\n To the rough beast that knows no gentle right,\r\n Nor aught obeys but his foul appetite.\r\n\r\nBut when a black-faced cloud the world doth threat,\r\nIn his dim mist th’ aspiring mountains hiding,\r\nFrom earth’s dark womb some gentle gust doth get,\r\nWhich blows these pitchy vapours from their biding,\r\nHind’ring their present fall by this dividing;\r\n So his unhallowed haste her words delays,\r\n And moody Pluto winks while Orpheus plays.\r\n\r\nYet, foul night-waking cat, he doth but dally,\r\nWhile in his hold-fast foot the weak mouse panteth.\r\nHer sad behaviour feeds his vulture folly,\r\nA swallowing gulf that even in plenty wanteth.\r\nHis ear her prayers admits, but his heart granteth\r\n No penetrable entrance to her plaining;\r\n Tears harden lust, though marble wear with raining.\r\n\r\nHer pity-pleading eyes are sadly fixed\r\nIn the remorseless wrinkles of his face.\r\nHer modest eloquence with sighs is mixed,\r\nWhich to her oratory adds more grace.\r\nShe puts the period often from his place,\r\n And midst the sentence so her accent breaks\r\n That twice she doth begin ere once she speaks.\r\n\r\nShe conjures him by high almighty Jove,\r\nBy knighthood, gentry, and sweet friendship’s oath,\r\nBy her untimely tears, her husband’s love,\r\nBy holy human law, and common troth,\r\nBy heaven and earth, and all the power of both,\r\n That to his borrowed bed he make retire,\r\n And stoop to honour, not to foul desire.\r\n\r\nQuoth she, “Reward not hospitality\r\nWith such black payment as thou hast pretended;\r\nMud not the fountain that gave drink to thee,\r\nMar not the thing that cannot be amended.\r\nEnd thy ill aim before the shoot be ended;\r\n He is no woodman that doth bend his bow\r\n To strike a poor unseasonable doe.\r\n\r\n“My husband is thy friend; for his sake spare me.\r\nThyself art mighty; for thine own sake leave me.\r\nMyself a weakling, do not then ensnare me;\r\nThou look’st not like deceit; do not deceive me.\r\nMy sighs, like whirlwinds, labour hence to heave thee.\r\n If ever man were moved with woman’s moans,\r\n Be moved with my tears, my sighs, my groans.\r\n\r\n“All which together, like a troubled ocean,\r\nBeat at thy rocky and wrack-threat’ning heart,\r\nTo soften it with their continual motion;\r\nFor stones dissolved to water do convert.\r\nO, if no harder than a stone thou art,\r\n Melt at my tears and be compassionate!\r\n Soft pity enters at an iron gate.\r\n\r\n“In Tarquin’s likeness I did entertain thee.\r\nHast thou put on his shape to do him shame?\r\nTo all the host of heaven I complain me,\r\nThou wrong’st his honour, wound’st his princely name.\r\nThou art not what thou seem’st; and if the same,\r\n Thou seem’st not what thou art, a god, a king;\r\n For kings like gods should govern everything.\r\n\r\n“How will thy shame be seeded in thine age,\r\nWhen thus thy vices bud before thy spring?\r\nIf in thy hope thou dar’st do such outrage,\r\nWhat dar’st thou not when once thou art a king?\r\nO, be remembered, no outrageous thing\r\n From vassal actors can be wiped away;\r\n Then kings’ misdeeds cannot be hid in clay.\r\n\r\n“This deed will make thee only loved for fear,\r\nBut happy monarchs still are feared for love.\r\nWith foul offenders thou perforce must bear,\r\nWhen they in thee the like offences prove.\r\nIf but for fear of this, thy will remove,\r\n For princes are the glass, the school, the book,\r\n Where subjects’ eyes do learn, do read, do look.\r\n\r\n“And wilt thou be the school where Lust shall learn?\r\nMust he in thee read lectures of such shame?\r\nWilt thou be glass, wherein it shall discern\r\nAuthority for sin, warrant for blame,\r\nTo privilege dishonour in thy name?\r\n Thou back’st reproach against long-living laud,\r\n And mak’st fair reputation but a bawd.\r\n\r\n“Hast thou command? By him that gave it thee,\r\nFrom a pure heart command thy rebel will.\r\nDraw not thy sword to guard iniquity,\r\nFor it was lent thee all that brood to kill.\r\nThy princely office how canst thou fulfill,\r\n When, patterned by thy fault, foul Sin may say\r\n He learned to sin, and thou didst teach the way?\r\n\r\n“Think but how vile a spectacle it were\r\nTo view thy present trespass in another.\r\nMen’s faults do seldom to themselves appear;\r\nTheir own transgressions partially they smother.\r\nThis guilt would seem death-worthy in thy brother.\r\n O how are they wrapped in with infamies\r\n That from their own misdeeds askance their eyes!\r\n\r\n“To thee, to thee, my heaved-up hands appeal,\r\nNot to seducing lust, thy rash relier.\r\nI sue for exiled majesty’s repeal;\r\nLet him return, and flatt’ring thoughts retire.\r\nHis true respect will prison false desire,\r\n And wipe the dim mist from thy doting eyne,\r\n That thou shalt see thy state, and pity mine.”\r\n\r\n“Have done,” quoth he. “My uncontrolled tide\r\nTurns not, but swells the higher by this let.\r\nSmall lights are soon blown out, huge fires abide,\r\nAnd with the wind in greater fury fret.\r\nThe petty streams that pay a daily debt\r\n To their salt sovereign, with their fresh falls’ haste\r\n Add to his flow, but alter not his taste.”\r\n\r\n“Thou art,” quoth she, “a sea, a sovereign king,\r\nAnd, lo, there falls into thy boundless flood\r\nBlack lust, dishonour, shame, misgoverning,\r\nWho seek to stain the ocean of thy blood.\r\nIf all these petty ills shall change thy good,\r\n Thy sea within a puddle’s womb is hearsed,\r\n And not the puddle in thy sea dispersed.\r\n\r\n“So shall these slaves be king, and thou their slave;\r\nThou nobly base, they basely dignified;\r\nThou their fair life, and they thy fouler grave;\r\nThou loathed in their shame, they in thy pride.\r\nThe lesser thing should not the greater hide;\r\n The cedar stoops not to the base shrub’s foot,\r\n But low shrubs wither at the cedar’s root.\r\n\r\n“So let thy thoughts, low vassals to thy state”—\r\n“No more,” quoth he, “by heaven, I will not hear thee.\r\nYield to my love. If not, enforced hate,\r\nInstead of love’s coy touch, shall rudely tear thee.\r\nThat done, despitefully I mean to bear thee\r\n Unto the base bed of some rascal groom,\r\n To be thy partner in this shameful doom.”\r\n\r\nThis said, he sets his foot upon the light,\r\nFor light and lust are deadly enemies.\r\nShame folded up in blind concealing night,\r\nWhen most unseen, then most doth tyrannize.\r\nThe wolf hath seized his prey, the poor lamb cries,\r\n Till with her own white fleece her voice controlled\r\n Entombs her outcry in her lips’ sweet fold.\r\n\r\nFor with the nightly linen that she wears\r\nHe pens her piteous clamours in her head,\r\nCooling his hot face in the chastest tears\r\nThat ever modest eyes with sorrow shed.\r\nO, that prone lust should stain so pure a bed!\r\n The spots whereof could weeping purify,\r\n Her tears should drop on them perpetually.\r\n\r\nBut she hath lost a dearer thing than life,\r\nAnd he hath won what he would lose again.\r\nThis forced league doth force a further strife;\r\nThis momentary joy breeds months of pain;\r\nThis hot desire converts to cold disdain.\r\n Pure Chastity is rifled of her store,\r\n And Lust, the thief, far poorer than before.\r\n\r\nLook as the full-fed hound or gorged hawk,\r\nUnapt for tender smell or speedy flight,\r\nMake slow pursuit, or altogether balk\r\nThe prey wherein by nature they delight;\r\nSo surfeit-taking Tarquin fares this night.\r\n His taste delicious, in digestion souring,\r\n Devours his will, that lived by foul devouring.\r\n\r\nO deeper sin than bottomless conceit\r\nCan comprehend in still imagination!\r\nDrunken desire must vomit his receipt,\r\nEre he can see his own abomination.\r\nWhile lust is in his pride no exclamation\r\n Can curb his heat or rein his rash desire,\r\n Till, like a jade, self-will himself doth tire.\r\n\r\nAnd then with lank and lean discoloured cheek,\r\nWith heavy eye, knit brow, and strengthless pace,\r\nFeeble desire, all recreant, poor, and meek,\r\nLike to a bankrout beggar wails his case.\r\nThe flesh being proud, desire doth fight with Grace,\r\n For there it revels; and when that decays,\r\n The guilty rebel for remission prays.\r\n\r\nSo fares it with this faultful lord of Rome,\r\nWho this accomplishment so hotly chased;\r\nFor now against himself he sounds this doom,\r\nThat through the length of times he stands disgraced.\r\nBesides, his soul’s fair temple is defaced,\r\n To whose weak ruins muster troops of cares,\r\n To ask the spotted princess how she fares.\r\n\r\nShe says her subjects with foul insurrection\r\nHave battered down her consecrated wall,\r\nAnd by their mortal fault brought in subjection\r\nHer immortality, and made her thrall\r\nTo living death and pain perpetual,\r\n Which in her prescience she controlled still,\r\n But her foresight could not forestall their will.\r\n\r\nE’en in this thought through the dark night he stealeth,\r\nA captive victor that hath lost in gain,\r\nBearing away the wound that nothing healeth,\r\nThe scar that will, despite of cure, remain;\r\nLeaving his spoil perplexed in greater pain.\r\n She bears the load of lust he left behind,\r\n And he the burden of a guilty mind.\r\n\r\nHe like a thievish dog creeps sadly thence;\r\nShe like a wearied lamb lies panting there;\r\nHe scowls, and hates himself for his offence;\r\nShe, desperate, with her nails her flesh doth tear.\r\nHe faintly flies, sweating with guilty fear;\r\n She stays, exclaiming on the direful night;\r\n He runs, and chides his vanished, loathed delight.\r\n\r\nHe thence departs a heavy convertite;\r\nShe there remains a hopeless castaway.\r\nHe in his speed looks for the morning light;\r\nShe prays she never may behold the day.\r\n“For day,” quoth she, “night’s scapes doth open lay,\r\n And my true eyes have never practised how\r\n To cloak offences with a cunning brow.\r\n\r\n“They think not but that every eye can see\r\nThe same disgrace which they themselves behold;\r\nAnd therefore would they still in darkness be,\r\nTo have their unseen sin remain untold.\r\nFor they their guilt with weeping will unfold,\r\n And grave, like water that doth eat in steel,\r\n Upon my cheeks what helpless shame I feel.”\r\n\r\nHere she exclaims against repose and rest,\r\nAnd bids her eyes hereafter still be blind.\r\nShe wakes her heart by beating on her breast,\r\nAnd bids it leap from thence, where it may find\r\nSome purer chest, to close so pure a mind.\r\n Frantic with grief thus breathes she forth her spite\r\n Against the unseen secrecy of night.\r\n\r\n“O comfort-killing night, image of hell,\r\nDim register and notary of shame,\r\nBlack stage for tragedies and murders fell,\r\nVast sin-concealing chaos, nurse of blame,\r\nBlind muffled bawd, dark harbour for defame,\r\n Grim cave of death, whisp’ring conspirator\r\n With close-tongued treason and the ravisher!\r\n\r\n“O hateful, vaporous, and foggy night,\r\nSince thou art guilty of my cureless crime,\r\nMuster thy mists to meet the eastern light,\r\nMake war against proportioned course of time;\r\nOr if thou wilt permit the sun to climb\r\n His wonted height, yet ere he go to bed,\r\n Knit poisonous clouds about his golden head.\r\n\r\n“With rotten damps ravish the morning air;\r\nLet their exhaled unwholesome breaths make sick\r\nThe life of purity, the supreme fair,\r\nEre he arrive his weary noontide prick.\r\nAnd let thy misty vapours march so thick,\r\n That in their smoky ranks his smothered light\r\n May set at noon and make perpetual night.\r\n\r\n“Were Tarquin night, as he is but night’s child,\r\nThe silver-shining queen he would distain;\r\nHer twinkling handmaids too, by him defiled,\r\nThrough Night’s black bosom should not peep again.\r\nSo should I have co-partners in my pain;\r\n And fellowship in woe doth woe assuage,\r\n As palmers’ chat makes short their pilgrimage.\r\n\r\n“Where now I have no one to blush with me,\r\nTo cross their arms and hang their heads with mine,\r\nTo mask their brows, and hide their infamy;\r\nBut I alone alone must sit and pine,\r\nSeasoning the earth with showers of silver brine,\r\n Mingling my talk with tears, my grief with groans,\r\n Poor wasting monuments of lasting moans.\r\n\r\n“O night, thou furnace of foul reeking smoke,\r\nLet not the jealous day behold that face\r\nWhich underneath thy black all-hiding cloak\r\nImmodesty lies martyred with disgrace!\r\nKeep still possession of thy gloomy place,\r\n That all the faults which in thy reign are made\r\n May likewise be sepulchred in thy shade.\r\n\r\n“Make me not object to the tell-tale day.\r\nThe light will show charactered in my brow\r\nThe story of sweet chastity’s decay,\r\nThe impious breach of holy wedlock vow.\r\nYea, the illiterate, that know not how\r\n To cipher what is writ in learned books,\r\n Will quote my loathsome trespass in my looks.\r\n\r\n“The nurse, to still her child, will tell my story\r\nAnd fright her crying babe with Tarquin’s name.\r\nThe orator, to deck his oratory,\r\nWill couple my reproach to Tarquin’s shame.\r\nFeast-finding minstrels, tuning my defame,\r\n Will tie the hearers to attend each line,\r\n How Tarquin wronged me, I Collatine.\r\n\r\n“Let my good name, that senseless reputation,\r\nFor Collatine’s dear love be kept unspotted.\r\nIf that be made a theme for disputation,\r\nThe branches of another root are rotted,\r\nAnd undeserved reproach to him allotted\r\n That is as clear from this attaint of mine\r\n As I, ere this, was pure to Collatine.\r\n\r\n“O unseen shame, invisible disgrace!\r\nO unfelt sore, crest-wounding, private scar!\r\nReproach is stamped in Collatinus’ face,\r\nAnd Tarquin’s eye may read the mot afar,\r\nHow he in peace is wounded, not in war.\r\n Alas, how many bear such shameful blows,\r\n Which not themselves, but he that gives them knows!\r\n\r\n“If, Collatine, thine honour lay in me,\r\nFrom me by strong assault it is bereft.\r\nMy honey lost, and I, a drone-like bee,\r\nHave no perfection of my summer left,\r\nBut robbed and ransacked by injurious theft.\r\n In thy weak hive a wand’ring wasp hath crept,\r\n And sucked the honey which thy chaste bee kept.\r\n\r\n“Yet am I guilty of thy honour’s wrack;\r\nYet for thy honour did I entertain him.\r\nComing from thee, I could not put him back,\r\nFor it had been dishonour to disdain him.\r\nBesides, of weariness he did complain him,\r\n And talked of virtue. O unlooked-for evil,\r\n When virtue is profaned in such a devil!\r\n\r\n“Why should the worm intrude the maiden bud?\r\nOr hateful cuckoos hatch in sparrows’ nests?\r\nOr toads infect fair founts with venom mud?\r\nOr tyrant folly lurk in gentle breasts?\r\nOr kings be breakers of their own behests?\r\n But no perfection is so absolute\r\n That some impurity doth not pollute.\r\n\r\n“The aged man that coffers up his gold\r\nIs plagued with cramps, and gouts and painful fits,\r\nAnd scarce hath eyes his treasure to behold,\r\nBut like still-pining Tantalus he sits,\r\nAnd useless barns the harvest of his wits,\r\n Having no other pleasure of his gain\r\n But torment that it cannot cure his pain.\r\n\r\n“So then he hath it when he cannot use it,\r\nAnd leaves it to be mastered by his young,\r\nWho in their pride do presently abuse it.\r\nTheir father was too weak, and they too strong,\r\nTo hold their cursed-blessed fortune long.\r\n The sweets we wish for turn to loathed sours\r\n Even in the moment that we call them ours.\r\n\r\n“Unruly blasts wait on the tender spring;\r\nUnwholesome weeds take root with precious flowers;\r\nThe adder hisses where the sweet birds sing;\r\nWhat virtue breeds iniquity devours.\r\nWe have no good that we can say is ours,\r\n But ill-annexed Opportunity\r\n Or kills his life or else his quality.\r\n\r\n“O Opportunity, thy guilt is great!\r\n’Tis thou that execut’st the traitor’s treason;\r\nThou sets the wolf where he the lamb may get;\r\nWhoever plots the sin, thou ’point’st the season.\r\n’Tis thou that spurn’st at right, at law, at reason;\r\n And in thy shady cell, where none may spy him,\r\n Sits Sin, to seize the souls that wander by him.\r\n\r\n“Thou mak’st the vestal violate her oath;\r\nThou blow’st the fire when temperance is thawed;\r\nThou smother’st honesty, thou murder’st troth,\r\nThou foul abettor, thou notorious bawd!\r\nThou plantest scandal and displacest laud.\r\n Thou ravisher, thou traitor, thou false thief,\r\n Thy honey turns to gall, thy joy to grief.\r\n\r\n“Thy secret pleasure turns to open shame,\r\nThy private feasting to a public fast,\r\nThy smoothing titles to a ragged name,\r\nThy sugared tongue to bitter wormwood taste.\r\nThy violent vanities can never last.\r\n How comes it then, vile Opportunity,\r\n Being so bad, such numbers seek for thee?\r\n\r\n“When wilt thou be the humble suppliant’s friend,\r\nAnd bring him where his suit may be obtained?\r\nWhen wilt thou sort an hour great strifes to end,\r\nOr free that soul which wretchedness hath chained?\r\nGive physic to the sick, ease to the pained?\r\n The poor, lame, blind, halt, creep, cry out for thee;\r\n But they ne’er meet with Opportunity.\r\n\r\n“The patient dies while the physician sleeps;\r\nThe orphan pines while the oppressor feeds;\r\nJustice is feasting while the widow weeps;\r\nAdvice is sporting while infection breeds.\r\nThou grant’st no time for charitable deeds.\r\n Wrath, envy, treason, rape, and murder’s rages,\r\n Thy heinous hours wait on them as their pages.\r\n\r\n“When truth and virtue have to do with thee,\r\nA thousand crosses keep them from thy aid;\r\nThey buy thy help; but Sin ne’er gives a fee;\r\nHe gratis comes, and thou art well appaid\r\nAs well to hear as grant what he hath said.\r\n My Collatine would else have come to me\r\n When Tarquin did, but he was stayed by thee.\r\n\r\n“Guilty thou art of murder and of theft,\r\nGuilty of perjury and subornation,\r\nGuilty of treason, forgery, and shift,\r\nGuilty of incest, that abomination:\r\nAn accessory by thine inclination\r\n To all sins past and all that are to come,\r\n From the creation to the general doom.\r\n\r\n“Misshapen Time, copesmate of ugly night,\r\nSwift subtle post, carrier of grisly care,\r\nEater of youth, false slave to false delight,\r\nBase watch of woes, sin’s pack-horse, virtue’s snare!\r\nThou nursest all and murd’rest all that are.\r\n O hear me then, injurious, shifting Time!\r\n Be guilty of my death, since of my crime.\r\n\r\n“Why hath thy servant, Opportunity\r\nBetrayed the hours thou gav’st me to repose,\r\nCancelled my fortunes, and enchained me\r\nTo endless date of never-ending woes?\r\nTime’s office is to fine the hate of foes,\r\n To eat up errors by opinion bred,\r\n Not spend the dowry of a lawful bed.\r\n\r\n“Time’s glory is to calm contending kings,\r\nTo unmask falsehood and bring truth to light,\r\nTo stamp the seal of time in aged things,\r\nTo wake the morn and sentinel the night,\r\nTo wrong the wronger till he render right,\r\n To ruinate proud buildings with thy hours,\r\n And smear with dust their glitt’ring golden towers;\r\n\r\n“To fill with worm-holes stately monuments,\r\nTo feed oblivion with decay of things,\r\nTo blot old books and alter their contents,\r\nTo pluck the quills from ancient ravens’ wings,\r\nTo dry the old oak’s sap and cherish springs,\r\n To spoil antiquities of hammered steel,\r\n And turn the giddy round of Fortune’s wheel;\r\n\r\n“To show the beldam daughters of her daughter,\r\nTo make the child a man, the man a child,\r\nTo slay the tiger that doth live by slaughter,\r\nTo tame the unicorn and lion wild,\r\nTo mock the subtle in themselves beguiled,\r\n To cheer the ploughman with increaseful crops,\r\n And waste huge stones with little water-drops.\r\n\r\n“Why work’st thou mischief in thy pilgrimage,\r\nUnless thou couldst return to make amends?\r\nOne poor retiring minute in an age\r\nWould purchase thee a thousand thousand friends,\r\nLending him wit that to bad debtors lends.\r\n O, this dread night, wouldst thou one hour come back,\r\n I could prevent this storm and shun thy wrack!\r\n\r\n“Thou ceaseless lackey to eternity,\r\nWith some mischance cross Tarquin in his flight.\r\nDevise extremes beyond extremity,\r\nTo make him curse this cursed crimeful night.\r\nLet ghastly shadows his lewd eyes affright,\r\n And the dire thought of his committed evil\r\n Shape every bush a hideous shapeless devil.\r\n\r\n“Disturb his hours of rest with restless trances,\r\nAfflict him in his bed with bedrid groans;\r\nLet there bechance him pitiful mischances,\r\nTo make him moan, but pity not his moans.\r\nStone him with hard’ned hearts harder than stones,\r\n And let mild women to him lose their mildness,\r\n Wilder to him than tigers in their wildness.\r\n\r\n“Let him have time to tear his curled hair,\r\nLet him have time against himself to rave,\r\nLet him have time of Time’s help to despair,\r\nLet him have time to live a loathed slave,\r\nLet him have time a beggar’s orts to crave,\r\n And time to see one that by alms doth live\r\n Disdain to him disdained scraps to give.\r\n\r\n“Let him have time to see his friends his foes,\r\nAnd merry fools to mock at him resort;\r\nLet him have time to mark how slow time goes\r\nIn time of sorrow, and how swift and short\r\nHis time of folly and his time of sport;\r\n And ever let his unrecalling crime\r\n Have time to wail th’ abusing of his time.\r\n\r\n“O Time, thou tutor both to good and bad,\r\nTeach me to curse him that thou taught’st this ill!\r\nAt his own shadow let the thief run mad,\r\nHimself himself seek every hour to kill.\r\nSuch wretched hands such wretched blood should spill,\r\n For who so base would such an office have\r\n As sland’rous deathsman to so base a slave?\r\n\r\n“The baser is he, coming from a king,\r\nTo shame his hope with deeds degenerate.\r\nThe mightier man, the mightier is the thing\r\nThat makes him honoured or begets him hate;\r\nFor greatest scandal waits on greatest state.\r\n The moon being clouded presently is missed,\r\n But little stars may hide them when they list.\r\n\r\n“The crow may bathe his coal-black wings in mire,\r\nAnd unperceived fly with the filth away;\r\nBut if the like the snow-white swan desire,\r\nThe stain upon his silver down will stay.\r\nPoor grooms are sightless night, kings glorious day.\r\n Gnats are unnoted wheresoe’er they fly,\r\n But eagles gazed upon with every eye.\r\n\r\n“Out, idle words, servants to shallow fools,\r\nUnprofitable sounds, weak arbitrators!\r\nBusy yourselves in skill-contending schools;\r\nDebate where leisure serves with dull debaters;\r\nTo trembling clients be you mediators.\r\n For me, I force not argument a straw,\r\n Since that my case is past the help of law.\r\n\r\n“In vain I rail at Opportunity,\r\nAt Time, at Tarquin, and uncheerful night;\r\nIn vain I cavil with mine infamy,\r\nIn vain I spurn at my confirmed despite.\r\nThis helpless smoke of words doth me no right.\r\n The remedy indeed to do me good\r\n Is to let forth my foul defiled blood.\r\n\r\n“Poor hand, why quiver’st thou at this decree?\r\nHonour thyself to rid me of this shame,\r\nFor if I die, my honour lives in thee,\r\nBut if I live, thou liv’st in my defame.\r\nSince thou couldst not defend thy loyal dame,\r\n And wast afeared to scratch her wicked foe,\r\n Kill both thyself and her for yielding so.”\r\n\r\nThis said, from her betumbled couch she starteth,\r\nTo find some desp’rate instrument of death;\r\nBut this no slaughterhouse no tool imparteth\r\nTo make more vent for passage of her breath,\r\nWhich, thronging through her lips, so vanisheth\r\n As smoke from Ætna, that in air consumes,\r\n Or that which from discharged cannon fumes.\r\n\r\n“In vain,” quoth she, “I live, and seek in vain\r\nSome happy mean to end a hapless life.\r\nI feared by Tarquin’s falchion to be slain,\r\nYet for the self-same purpose seek a knife.\r\nBut when I feared I was a loyal wife;\r\n So am I now.—O no, that cannot be!\r\n Of that true type hath Tarquin rifled me.\r\n\r\n“O that is gone for which I sought to live,\r\nAnd therefore now I need not fear to die.\r\nTo clear this spot by death, at least I give\r\nA badge of fame to slander’s livery,\r\nA dying life to living infamy.\r\n Poor helpless help, the treasure stol’n away,\r\n To burn the guiltless casket where it lay!\r\n\r\n“Well, well, dear Collatine, thou shalt not know\r\nThe stained taste of violated troth;\r\nI will not wrong thy true affection so,\r\nTo flatter thee with an infringed oath.\r\nThis bastard graff shall never come to growth;\r\n He shall not boast who did thy stock pollute\r\n That thou art doting father of his fruit.\r\n\r\n“Nor shall he smile at thee in secret thought,\r\nNor laugh with his companions at thy state;\r\nBut thou shalt know thy int’rest was not bought\r\nBasely with gold, but stol’n from forth thy gate.\r\nFor me, I am the mistress of my fate,\r\n And with my trespass never will dispense,\r\n Till life to death acquit my forced offence.\r\n\r\n“I will not poison thee with my attaint,\r\nNor fold my fault in cleanly-coined excuses;\r\nMy sable ground of sin I will not paint,\r\nTo hide the truth of this false night’s abuses.\r\nMy tongue shall utter all; mine eyes, like sluices,\r\n As from a mountain-spring that feeds a dale,\r\n Shall gush pure streams to purge my impure tale.”\r\n\r\nBy this, lamenting Philomel had ended\r\nThe well-tuned warble of her nightly sorrow,\r\nAnd solemn night with slow sad gait descended\r\nTo ugly hell; when, lo, the blushing morrow\r\nLends light to all fair eyes that light will borrow.\r\n But cloudy Lucrece shames herself to see,\r\n And therefore still in night would cloistered be.\r\n\r\nRevealing day through every cranny spies,\r\nAnd seems to point her out where she sits weeping,\r\nTo whom she sobbing speaks: “O eye of eyes,\r\nWhy pry’st thou through my window? Leave thy peeping,\r\nMock with thy tickling beams eyes that are sleeping.\r\n Brand not my forehead with thy piercing light,\r\n For day hath naught to do what’s done by night.”\r\n\r\nThus cavils she with everything she sees.\r\nTrue grief is fond and testy as a child,\r\nWho wayward once, his mood with naught agrees.\r\nOld woes, not infant sorrows, bear them mild.\r\nContinuance tames the one; the other wild,\r\n Like an unpractised swimmer plunging still\r\n With too much labour drowns for want of skill.\r\n\r\nSo she, deep-drenched in a sea of care,\r\nHolds disputation with each thing she views,\r\nAnd to herself all sorrow doth compare;\r\nNo object but her passion’s strength renews,\r\nAnd as one shifts, another straight ensues.\r\n Sometime her grief is dumb and hath no words;\r\n Sometime ’tis mad and too much talk affords.\r\n\r\nThe little birds that tune their morning’s joy\r\nMake her moans mad with their sweet melody.\r\nFor mirth doth search the bottom of annoy;\r\nSad souls are slain in merry company.\r\nGrief best is pleased with grief’s society;\r\n True sorrow then is feelingly sufficed\r\n When with like semblance it is sympathized.\r\n\r\n’Tis double death to drown in ken of shore;\r\nHe ten times pines that pines beholding food;\r\nTo see the salve doth make the wound ache more;\r\nGreat grief grieves most at that would do it good;\r\nDeep woes roll forward like a gentle flood,\r\n Who, being stopped, the bounding banks o’erflows;\r\n Grief dallied with nor law nor limit knows.\r\n\r\n“You mocking birds,” quoth she, “your tunes entomb\r\nWithin your hollow-swelling feathered breasts,\r\nAnd in my hearing be you mute and dumb;\r\nMy restless discord loves no stops nor rests.\r\nA woeful hostess brooks not merry guests.\r\n Relish your nimble notes to pleasing ears;\r\n Distress likes dumps when time is kept with tears.\r\n\r\n“Come, Philomel, that sing’st of ravishment,\r\nMake thy sad grove in my disheveled hair.\r\nAs the dank earth weeps at thy languishment,\r\nSo I at each sad strain will strain a tear\r\nAnd with deep groans the diapason bear;\r\n For burden-wise I’ll hum on Tarquin still,\r\n While thou on Tereus descants better skill.\r\n\r\n“And whiles against a thorn thou bear’st thy part\r\nTo keep thy sharp woes waking, wretched I,\r\nTo imitate thee well, against my heart\r\nWill fix a sharp knife to affright mine eye,\r\nWho if it wink shall thereon fall and die.\r\n These means, as frets upon an instrument,\r\n Shall tune our heart-strings to true languishment.\r\n\r\n“And for, poor bird, thou sing’st not in the day,\r\nAs shaming any eye should thee behold,\r\nSome dark deep desert seated from the way,\r\nThat knows not parching heat nor freezing cold,\r\nWill we find out; and there we will unfold\r\n To creatures stern sad tunes to change their kinds.\r\n Since men prove beasts, let beasts bear gentle minds.”\r\n\r\nAs the poor frighted deer that stands at gaze,\r\nWildly determining which way to fly,\r\nOr one encompassed with a winding maze,\r\nThat cannot tread the way out readily;\r\nSo with herself is she in mutiny,\r\n To live or die which of the twain were better,\r\n When life is shamed and Death reproach’s debtor.\r\n\r\n“To kill myself,” quoth she, “alack, what were it,\r\nBut with my body my poor soul’s pollution?\r\nThey that lose half with greater patience bear it\r\nThan they whose whole is swallowed in confusion.\r\nThat mother tries a merciless conclusion\r\n Who, having two sweet babes, when death takes one,\r\n Will slay the other, and be nurse to none.\r\n\r\n“My body or my soul, which was the dearer,\r\nWhen the one pure, the other made divine?\r\nWhose love of either to myself was nearer,\r\nWhen both were kept for heaven and Collatine?\r\nAy me, the bark pilled from the lofty pine,\r\n His leaves will wither and his sap decay;\r\n So must my soul, her bark being pilled away.\r\n\r\n“Her house is sacked, her quiet interrupted,\r\nHer mansion battered by the enemy,\r\nHer sacred temple spotted, spoiled, corrupted,\r\nGrossly engirt with daring infamy.\r\nThen let it not be called impiety,\r\n If in this blemished fort I make some hole\r\n Through which I may convey this troubled soul.\r\n\r\n“Yet die I will not till my Collatine\r\nHave heard the cause of my untimely death,\r\nThat he may vow, in that sad hour of mine,\r\nRevenge on him that made me stop my breath.\r\nMy stained blood to Tarquin I’ll bequeath,\r\n Which by him tainted shall for him be spent,\r\n And as his due writ in my testament.\r\n\r\n“My honour I’ll bequeath unto the knife\r\nThat wounds my body so dishonoured.\r\n’Tis honour to deprive dishonoured life;\r\nThe one will live, the other being dead.\r\nSo of shame’s ashes shall my fame be bred,\r\n For in my death I murder shameful scorn;\r\n My shame so dead, mine honour is new born.\r\n\r\n“Dear lord of that dear jewel I have lost,\r\nWhat legacy shall I bequeath to thee?\r\nMy resolution, love, shall be thy boast,\r\nBy whose example thou revenged mayst be.\r\nHow Tarquin must be used, read it in me;\r\n Myself, thy friend, will kill myself, thy foe,\r\n And for my sake serve thou false Tarquin so.\r\n\r\n“This brief abridgement of my will I make:\r\nMy soul and body to the skies and ground;\r\nMy resolution, husband, do thou take;\r\nMine honour be the knife’s that makes my wound;\r\nMy shame be his that did my fame confound;\r\n And all my fame that lives disbursed be\r\n To those that live and think no shame of me.\r\n\r\n“Thou, Collatine, shalt oversee this will;\r\nHow was I overseen that thou shalt see it!\r\nMy blood shall wash the slander of mine ill;\r\nMy life’s foul deed my life’s fair end shall free it.\r\nFaint not, faint heart, but stoutly say, ‘So be it.’\r\n Yield to my hand; my hand shall conquer thee.\r\n Thou dead, both die, and both shall victors be.”\r\n\r\nThis plot of death when sadly she had laid,\r\nAnd wiped the brinish pearl from her bright eyes,\r\nWith untuned tongue she hoarsely called her maid,\r\nWhose swift obedience to her mistress hies;\r\nFor fleet-winged duty with thought’s feathers flies.\r\n Poor Lucrece’ cheeks unto her maid seem so\r\n As winter meads when sun doth melt their snow.\r\n\r\nHer mistress she doth give demure good-morrow,\r\nWith soft slow tongue, true mark of modesty,\r\nAnd sorts a sad look to her lady’s sorrow,\r\nFor why her face wore sorrow’s livery,\r\nBut durst not ask of her audaciously\r\n Why her two suns were cloud-eclipsed so,\r\n Nor why her fair cheeks over-washed with woe.\r\n\r\nBut as the earth doth weep, the sun being set,\r\nEach flower moistened like a melting eye,\r\nEven so the maid with swelling drops ’gan wet\r\nHer circled eyne, enforced by sympathy\r\nOf those fair suns set in her mistress’ sky,\r\n Who in a salt-waved ocean quench their light,\r\n Which makes the maid weep like the dewy night.\r\n\r\nA pretty while these pretty creatures stand,\r\nLike ivory conduits coral cisterns filling.\r\nOne justly weeps; the other takes in hand\r\nNo cause, but company, of her drops spilling.\r\nTheir gentle sex to weep are often willing,\r\n Grieving themselves to guess at others’ smarts,\r\n And then they drown their eyes or break their hearts.\r\n\r\nFor men have marble, women waxen, minds,\r\nAnd therefore are they formed as marble will;\r\nThe weak oppressed, th’ impression of strange kinds\r\nIs formed in them by force, by fraud, or skill.\r\nThen call them not the authors of their ill,\r\n No more than wax shall be accounted evil,\r\n Wherein is stamped the semblance of a devil.\r\n\r\nTheir smoothness, like a goodly champaign plain,\r\nLays open all the little worms that creep;\r\nIn men, as in a rough-grown grove, remain\r\nCave-keeping evils that obscurely sleep.\r\nThrough crystal walls each little mote will peep.\r\n Though men can cover crimes with bold stern looks,\r\n Poor women’s faces are their own faults’ books.\r\n\r\nNo man inveigh against the withered flower,\r\nBut chide rough winter that the flower hath killed;\r\nNot that devoured, but that which doth devour,\r\nIs worthy blame. O, let it not be hild\r\nPoor women’s faults, that they are so fulfilled\r\n With men’s abuses! Those proud lords, to blame,\r\n Make weak-made women tenants to their shame.\r\n\r\nThe precedent whereof in Lucrece view,\r\nAssailed by night with circumstances strong\r\nOf present death, and shame that might ensue\r\nBy that her death, to do her husband wrong.\r\nSuch danger to resistance did belong,\r\n The dying fear through all her body spread;\r\n And who cannot abuse a body dead?\r\n\r\nBy this, mild patience bid fair Lucrece speak\r\nTo the poor counterfeit of her complaining:\r\n“My girl,” quoth she, “on what occasion break\r\nThose tears from thee, that down thy cheeks are raining?\r\nIf thou dost weep for grief of my sustaining,\r\n Know, gentle wench, it small avails my mood.\r\n If tears could help, mine own would do me good.\r\n\r\n“But tell me, girl, when went”—and there she stayed\r\nTill after a deep groan—“Tarquin from hence?”\r\n“Madam, ere I was up,” replied the maid,\r\n“The more to blame my sluggard negligence.\r\nYet with the fault I thus far can dispense:\r\n Myself was stirring ere the break of day,\r\n And, ere I rose, was Tarquin gone away.\r\n\r\n“But, lady, if your maid may be so bold,\r\nShe would request to know your heaviness.”\r\n“O peace!” quoth Lucrece. “If it should be told,\r\nThe repetition cannot make it less;\r\nFor more it is than I can well express,\r\n And that deep torture may be called a hell,\r\n When more is felt than one hath power to tell.\r\n\r\n“Go, get me hither paper, ink, and pen.\r\nYet save that labour, for I have them here.\r\nWhat should I say?—One of my husband’s men\r\nBid thou be ready by and by to bear\r\nA letter to my lord, my love, my dear.\r\n Bid him with speed prepare to carry it;\r\n The cause craves haste, and it will soon be writ.”\r\n\r\nHer maid is gone, and she prepares to write,\r\nFirst hovering o’er the paper with her quill.\r\nConceit and grief an eager combat fight;\r\nWhat wit sets down is blotted straight with will;\r\nThis is too curious-good, this blunt and ill.\r\n Much like a press of people at a door,\r\n Throng her inventions, which shall go before.\r\n\r\nAt last she thus begins: “Thou worthy lord\r\nOf that unworthy wife that greeteth thee,\r\nHealth to thy person! Next vouchsafe t’ afford,\r\nIf ever, love, thy Lucrece thou wilt see,\r\nSome present speed to come and visit me.\r\n So I commend me from our house in grief.\r\n My woes are tedious, though my words are brief.”\r\n\r\nHere folds she up the tenor of her woe,\r\nHer certain sorrow writ uncertainly.\r\nBy this short schedule Collatine may know\r\nHer grief, but not her grief’s true quality;\r\nShe dares not thereof make discovery,\r\n Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse,\r\n Ere she with blood had stained her stained excuse.\r\n\r\nBesides, the life and feeling of her passion\r\nShe hoards, to spend when he is by to hear her;\r\nWhen sighs and groans and tears may grace the fashion\r\nOf her disgrace, the better so to clear her\r\nFrom that suspicion which the world might bear her.\r\n To shun this blot, she would not blot the letter\r\n With words, till action might become them better.\r\n\r\nTo see sad sights moves more than hear them told,\r\nFor then the eye interprets to the ear\r\nThe heavy motion that it doth behold,\r\nWhen every part a part of woe doth bear.\r\n’Tis but a part of sorrow that we hear.\r\n Deep sounds make lesser noise than shallow fords,\r\n And sorrow ebbs, being blown with wind of words.\r\n\r\nHer letter now is sealed, and on it writ\r\n“At Ardea to my lord with more than haste.”\r\nThe post attends, and she delivers it,\r\nCharging the sour-faced groom to hie as fast\r\nAs lagging fowls before the northern blast.\r\n Speed more than speed but dull and slow she deems;\r\n Extremely still urgeth such extremes.\r\n\r\nThe homely villain curtsies to her low,\r\nAnd, blushing on her with a steadfast eye,\r\nReceives the scroll without or yea or no,\r\nAnd forth with bashful innocence doth hie.\r\nBut they whose guilt within their bosoms lie\r\n Imagine every eye beholds their blame,\r\n For Lucrece thought he blushed to see her shame,\r\n\r\nWhen, silly groom! God wot, it was defect\r\nOf spirit, life, and bold audacity.\r\nSuch harmless creatures have a true respect\r\nTo talk in deeds, while others saucily\r\nPromise more speed, but do it leisurely.\r\n Even so this pattern of the worn-out age\r\n Pawned honest looks, but laid no words to gage.\r\n\r\nHis kindled duty kindled her mistrust,\r\nThat two red fires in both their faces blazed;\r\nShe thought he blushed, as knowing Tarquin’s lust,\r\nAnd, blushing with him, wistly on him gazed.\r\nHer earnest eye did make him more amazed.\r\n The more she saw the blood his cheeks replenish,\r\n The more she thought he spied in her some blemish.\r\n\r\nBut long she thinks till he return again,\r\nAnd yet the duteous vassal scarce is gone.\r\nThe weary time she cannot entertain,\r\nFor now ’tis stale to sigh, to weep, to groan;\r\nSo woe hath wearied woe, moan tired moan,\r\n That she her plaints a little while doth stay,\r\n Pausing for means to mourn some newer way.\r\n\r\nAt last she calls to mind where hangs a piece\r\nOf skilful painting, made for Priam’s Troy,\r\nBefore the which is drawn the power of Greece,\r\nFor Helen’s rape the city to destroy,\r\nThreat’ning cloud-kissing Ilion with annoy;\r\n Which the conceited painter drew so proud,\r\n As heaven, it seemed, to kiss the turrets bowed.\r\n\r\nA thousand lamentable objects there,\r\nIn scorn of Nature, Art gave lifeless life.\r\nMany a dry drop seemed a weeping tear,\r\nShed for the slaughtered husband by the wife.\r\nThe red blood reeked to show the painter’s strife,\r\n The dying eyes gleamed forth their ashy lights,\r\n Like dying coals burnt out in tedious nights.\r\n\r\nThere might you see the labouring pioneer\r\nBegrimed with sweat and smeared all with dust;\r\nAnd from the towers of Troy there would appear\r\nThe very eyes of men through loop-holes thrust,\r\nGazing upon the Greeks with little lust.\r\n Such sweet observance in this work was had,\r\n That one might see those far-off eyes look sad.\r\n\r\nIn great commanders grace and majesty\r\nYou might behold, triumphing in their faces;\r\nIn youth, quick bearing and dexterity;\r\nAnd here and there the painter interlaces\r\nPale cowards marching on with trembling paces,\r\n Which heartless peasants did so well resemble,\r\n That one would swear he saw them quake and tremble.\r\n\r\nIn Ajax and Ulysses, O, what art\r\nOf physiognomy might one behold!\r\nThe face of either ciphered either’s heart;\r\nTheir face their manners most expressly told.\r\nIn Ajax’ eyes blunt rage and rigour rolled,\r\n But the mild glance that sly Ulysses lent\r\n Showed deep regard and smiling government.\r\n\r\nThere pleading might you see grave Nestor stand,\r\nAs ’twere encouraging the Greeks to fight,\r\nMaking such sober action with his hand\r\nThat it beguiled attention, charmed the sight.\r\nIn speech, it seemed, his beard, all silver white,\r\n Wagged up and down, and from his lips did fly\r\n Thin winding breath, which purled up to the sky.\r\n\r\nAbout him were a press of gaping faces,\r\nWhich seemed to swallow up his sound advice,\r\nAll jointly list’ning, but with several graces,\r\nAs if some mermaid did their ears entice;\r\nSome high, some low, the painter was so nice.\r\n The scalps of many, almost hid behind,\r\n To jump up higher seemed to mock the mind.\r\n\r\nHere one man’s hand leaned on another’s head,\r\nHis nose being shadowed by his neighbour’s ear;\r\nHere one being thronged bears back, all boll’n and red;\r\nAnother smothered seems to pelt and swear;\r\nAnd in their rage such signs of rage they bear\r\n As, but for loss of Nestor’s golden words,\r\n It seemed they would debate with angry swords.\r\n\r\nFor much imaginary work was there,\r\nConceit deceitful, so compact, so kind,\r\nThat for Achilles’ image stood his spear\r\nGriped in an armed hand; himself, behind,\r\nWas left unseen, save to the eye of mind.\r\n A hand, a foot, a face, a leg, a head,\r\n Stood for the whole to be imagined.\r\n\r\nAnd from the walls of strong-besieged Troy,\r\nWhen their brave hope, bold Hector, marched to field,\r\nStood many Trojan mothers, sharing joy\r\nTo see their youthful sons bright weapons wield;\r\nAnd to their hope they such odd action yield\r\n That through their light joy seemed to appear,\r\n Like bright things stained, a kind of heavy fear.\r\n\r\nAnd from the strand of Dardan, where they fought,\r\nTo Simois’ reedy banks the red blood ran,\r\nWhose waves to imitate the battle sought\r\nWith swelling ridges, and their ranks began\r\nTo break upon the galled shore, and then\r\n Retire again till, meeting greater ranks,\r\n They join, and shoot their foam at Simois’ banks.\r\n\r\nTo this well-painted piece is Lucrece come,\r\nTo find a face where all distress is stelled.\r\nMany she sees where cares have carved some,\r\nBut none where all distress and dolour dwelled,\r\nTill she despairing Hecuba beheld,\r\n Staring on Priam’s wounds with her old eyes,\r\n Which bleeding under Pyrrhus’ proud foot lies.\r\n\r\nIn her the painter had anatomized\r\nTime’s ruin, beauty’s wrack, and grim care’s reign.\r\nHer cheeks with chops and wrinkles were disguised;\r\nOf what she was no semblance did remain.\r\nHer blue blood, changed to black in every vein,\r\n Wanting the spring that those shrunk pipes had fed,\r\n Showed life imprisoned in a body dead.\r\n\r\nOn this sad shadow Lucrece spends her eyes,\r\nAnd shapes her sorrow to the beldam’s woes,\r\nWho nothing wants to answer her but cries\r\nAnd bitter words to ban her cruel foes.\r\nThe painter was no god to lend her those,\r\n And therefore Lucrece swears he did her wrong,\r\n To give her so much grief, and not a tongue.\r\n\r\n“Poor instrument,” quoth she, “without a sound,\r\nI’ll tune thy woes with my lamenting tongue,\r\nAnd drop sweet balm in Priam’s painted wound,\r\nAnd rail on Pyrrhus that hath done him wrong,\r\nAnd with my tears quench Troy that burns so long,\r\n And with my knife scratch out the angry eyes\r\n Of all the Greeks that are thine enemies.\r\n\r\n“Show me the strumpet that began this stir,\r\nThat with my nails her beauty I may tear.\r\nThy heat of lust, fond Paris, did incur\r\nThis load of wrath that burning Troy doth bear;\r\nThy eye kindled the fire that burneth here,\r\n And here in Troy, for trespass of thine eye,\r\n The sire, the son, the dame, and daughter die.\r\n\r\n“Why should the private pleasure of some one\r\nBecome the public plague of many moe?\r\nLet sin, alone committed, light alone\r\nUpon his head that hath transgressed so;\r\nLet guiltless souls be freed from guilty woe.\r\n For one’s offence why should so many fall,\r\n To plague a private sin in general?\r\n\r\n“Lo, here weeps Hecuba, here Priam dies,\r\nHere manly Hector faints, here Troilus swounds;\r\nHere friend by friend in bloody channel lies,\r\nAnd friend to friend gives unadvised wounds,\r\nAnd one man’s lust these many lives confounds.\r\n Had doting Priam checked his son’s desire,\r\n Troy had been bright with fame and not with fire.”\r\n\r\nHere feelingly she weeps Troy’s painted woes,\r\nFor sorrow, like a heavy-hanging bell,\r\nOnce set on ringing, with his own weight goes;\r\nThen little strength rings out the doleful knell.\r\nSo Lucrece set a-work, sad tales doth tell\r\n To pencilled pensiveness and coloured sorrow;\r\n She lends them words, and she their looks doth borrow.\r\n\r\nShe throws her eyes about the painting round,\r\nAnd who she finds forlorn she doth lament.\r\nAt last she sees a wretched image bound,\r\nThat piteous looks to Phrygian shepherds lent.\r\nHis face, though full of cares, yet showed content;\r\n Onward to Troy with the blunt swains he goes,\r\n So mild, that patience seemed to scorn his woes.\r\n\r\nIn him the painter laboured with his skill\r\nTo hide deceit and give the harmless show\r\nAn humble gait, calm looks, eyes wailing still,\r\nA brow unbent that seemed to welcome woe,\r\nCheeks neither red nor pale, but mingled so\r\n That blushing red no guilty instance gave,\r\n Nor ashy pale the fear that false hearts have.\r\n\r\nBut, like a constant and confirmed devil,\r\nHe entertained a show so seeming just,\r\nAnd therein so ensconced his secret evil,\r\nThat jealousy itself could not mistrust\r\nFalse-creeping craft and perjury should thrust\r\n Into so bright a day such black-faced storms,\r\n Or blot with hell-born sin such saint-like forms.\r\n\r\nThe well-skilled workman this mild image drew\r\nFor perjured Sinon, whose enchanting story\r\nThe credulous Old Priam after slew;\r\nWhose words like wildfire burnt the shining glory\r\nOf rich-built Ilion, that the skies were sorry,\r\n And little stars shot from their fixed places,\r\n When their glass fell wherein they viewed their faces.\r\n\r\nThis picture she advisedly perused,\r\nAnd chid the painter for his wondrous skill,\r\nSaying some shape in Sinon’s was abused;\r\nSo fair a form lodged not a mind so ill.\r\nAnd still on him she gazed, and gazing still,\r\n Such signs of truth in his plain face she spied,\r\n That she concludes the picture was belied.\r\n\r\n“It cannot be,” quoth she, “that so much guile”—\r\nShe would have said “can lurk in such a look.”\r\nBut Tarquin’s shape came in her mind the while,\r\nAnd from her tongue “can lurk” from “cannot” took.\r\n“It cannot be” she in that sense forsook,\r\n And turned it thus: “It cannot be, I find,\r\n But such a face should bear a wicked mind.\r\n\r\n“For even as subtle Sinon here is painted,\r\nSo sober-sad, so weary, and so mild,\r\nAs if with grief or travail he had fainted,\r\nTo me came Tarquin armed too, beguiled\r\nWith outward honesty, but yet defiled\r\n With inward vice. As Priam him did cherish,\r\n So did I Tarquin; so my Troy did perish.\r\n\r\n“Look, look, how listening Priam wets his eyes,\r\nTo see those borrowed tears that Sinon sheds!\r\nPriam, why art thou old and yet not wise?\r\nFor every tear he falls a Trojan bleeds.\r\nHis eye drops fire, no water thence proceeds;\r\n Those round clear pearls of his that move thy pity,\r\n Are balls of quenchless fire to burn thy city.\r\n\r\n“Such devils steal effects from lightless hell,\r\nFor Sinon in his fire doth quake with cold,\r\nAnd in that cold hot-burning fire doth dwell.\r\nThese contraries such unity do hold,\r\nOnly to flatter fools and make them bold;\r\n So Priam’s trust false Sinon’s tears doth flatter,\r\n That he finds means to burn his Troy with water.”\r\n\r\nHere, all enraged, such passion her assails,\r\nThat patience is quite beaten from her breast.\r\nShe tears the senseless Sinon with her nails,\r\nComparing him to that unhappy guest\r\nWhose deed hath made herself herself detest.\r\n At last she smilingly with this gives o’er;\r\n “Fool, fool!” quoth she, “his wounds will not be sore.”\r\n\r\nThus ebbs and flows the current of her sorrow,\r\nAnd time doth weary time with her complaining.\r\nShe looks for night, and then she longs for morrow,\r\nAnd both she thinks too long with her remaining.\r\nShort time seems long in sorrow’s sharp sustaining.\r\n Though woe be heavy, yet it seldom sleeps,\r\n And they that watch see time how slow it creeps.\r\n\r\nWhich all this time hath overslipped her thought,\r\nThat she with painted images hath spent,\r\nBeing from the feeling of her own grief brought\r\nBy deep surmise of others’ detriment,\r\nLosing her woes in shows of discontent.\r\n It easeth some, though none it ever cured,\r\n To think their dolour others have endured.\r\n\r\nBut now the mindful messenger, come back,\r\nBrings home his lord and other company;\r\nWho finds his Lucrece clad in mourning black,\r\nAnd round about her tear-distained eye\r\nBlue circles streamed, like rainbows in the sky.\r\n These water-galls in her dim element\r\n Foretell new storms to those already spent.\r\n\r\nWhich when her sad-beholding husband saw,\r\nAmazedly in her sad face he stares.\r\nHer eyes, though sod in tears, looked red and raw,\r\nHer lively colour killed with deadly cares.\r\nHe hath no power to ask her how she fares;\r\n Both stood like old acquaintance in a trance,\r\n Met far from home, wond’ring each other’s chance.\r\n\r\nAt last he takes her by the bloodless hand,\r\nAnd thus begins: “What uncouth ill event\r\nHath thee befall’n, that thou dost trembling stand?\r\nSweet love, what spite hath thy fair colour spent?\r\nWhy art thou thus attired in discontent?\r\n Unmask, dear dear, this moody heaviness,\r\n And tell thy grief, that we may give redress.”\r\n\r\nThree times with sighs she gives her sorrow fire,\r\nEre once she can discharge one word of woe.\r\nAt length addressed to answer his desire,\r\nShe modestly prepares to let them know\r\nHer honour is ta’en prisoner by the foe;\r\n While Collatine and his consorted lords\r\n With sad attention long to hear her words.\r\n\r\nAnd now this pale swan in her wat’ry nest\r\nBegins the sad dirge of her certain ending:\r\n“Few words,” quoth she, “shall fit the trespass best,\r\nWhere no excuse can give the fault amending.\r\nIn me more woes than words are now depending;\r\n And my laments would be drawn out too long,\r\n To tell them all with one poor tired tongue.\r\n\r\n“Then be this all the task it hath to say:\r\nDear husband, in the interest of thy bed\r\nA stranger came, and on that pillow lay\r\nWhere thou wast wont to rest thy weary head;\r\nAnd what wrong else may be imagined\r\n By foul enforcement might be done to me,\r\n From that, alas, thy Lucrece is not free.\r\n\r\n“For in the dreadful dead of dark midnight,\r\nWith shining falchion in my chamber came\r\nA creeping creature with a flaming light,\r\nAnd softly cried ‘Awake, thou Roman dame,\r\nAnd entertain my love; else lasting shame\r\n On thee and thine this night I will inflict,\r\n If thou my love’s desire do contradict.\r\n\r\n“‘For some hard-favoured groom of thine,’ quoth he,\r\n‘Unless thou yoke thy liking to my will,\r\nI’ll murder straight, and then I’ll slaughter thee\r\nAnd swear I found you where you did fulfil\r\nThe loathsome act of lust, and so did kill\r\n The lechers in their deed. This act will be\r\n My fame and thy perpetual infamy.’\r\n\r\n“With this, I did begin to start and cry,\r\nAnd then against my heart he sets his sword,\r\nSwearing, unless I took all patiently,\r\nI should not live to speak another word;\r\nSo should my shame still rest upon record,\r\n And never be forgot in mighty Rome\r\n The adulterate death of Lucrece and her groom.\r\n\r\n“Mine enemy was strong, my poor self weak,\r\nAnd far the weaker with so strong a fear.\r\nMy bloody judge forbade my tongue to speak;\r\nNo rightful plea might plead for justice there.\r\nHis scarlet lust came evidence to swear\r\n That my poor beauty had purloined his eyes;\r\n And when the judge is robbed, the prisoner dies.\r\n\r\n“O, teach me how to make mine own excuse,\r\nOr at the least, this refuge let me find:\r\nThough my gross blood be stained with this abuse,\r\nImmaculate and spotless is my mind;\r\nThat was not forced; that never was inclined\r\n To accessary yieldings, but still pure\r\n Doth in her poisoned closet yet endure.”\r\n\r\nLo, here the hopeless merchant of this loss,\r\nWith head declined and voice dammed up with woe,\r\nWith sad set eyes and wretched arms across,\r\nFrom lips new-waxen pale begins to blow\r\nThe grief away that stops his answer so.\r\n But wretched as he is, he strives in vain;\r\n What he breathes out his breath drinks up again.\r\n\r\nAs through an arch the violent roaring tide\r\nOutruns the eye that doth behold his haste,\r\nYet in the eddy boundeth in his pride\r\nBack to the strait that forced him on so fast,\r\nIn rage sent out, recalled in rage, being past:\r\n Even so his sighs, his sorrows make a saw,\r\n To push grief on, and back the same grief draw.\r\n\r\nWhich speechless woe of his poor she attendeth,\r\nAnd his untimely frenzy thus awaketh:\r\n“Dear lord, thy sorrow to my sorrow lendeth\r\nAnother power; no flood by raining slaketh.\r\nMy woe too sensible thy passion maketh\r\n More feeling-painful. Let it then suffice\r\n To drown one woe, one pair of weeping eyes.\r\n\r\n“And for my sake, when I might charm thee so,\r\nFor she that was thy Lucrece, now attend me:\r\nBe suddenly revenged on my foe,\r\nThine, mine, his own. Suppose thou dost defend me\r\nFrom what is past. The help that thou shalt lend me\r\n Comes all too late, yet let the traitor die,\r\n For sparing justice feeds iniquity.\r\n\r\n“But ere I name him, you fair lords,” quoth she,\r\nSpeaking to those that came with Collatine,\r\n“Shall plight your honourable faiths to me,\r\nWith swift pursuit to venge this wrong of mine;\r\nFor ’tis a meritorious fair design\r\n To chase injustice with revengeful arms.\r\n Knights, by their oaths, should right poor ladies’ harms.”\r\n\r\nAt this request, with noble disposition\r\nEach present lord began to promise aid,\r\nAs bound in knighthood to her imposition,\r\nLonging to hear the hateful foe bewrayed.\r\nBut she, that yet her sad task hath not said,\r\n The protestation stops. “O, speak,” quoth she,\r\n “How may this forced stain be wiped from me?\r\n\r\n“What is the quality of my offence,\r\nBeing constrained with dreadful circumstance?\r\nMay my pure mind with the foul act dispense,\r\nMy low-declined honour to advance?\r\nMay any terms acquit me from this chance?\r\n The poisoned fountain clears itself again,\r\n And why not I from this compelled stain?\r\n\r\nWith this, they all at once began to say,\r\nHer body’s stain her mind untainted clears,\r\nWhile with a joyless smile she turns away\r\nThe face, that map which deep impression bears\r\nOf hard misfortune, carved in it with tears.\r\n “No, no,” quoth she, “no dame, hereafter living\r\n By my excuse shall claim excuse’s giving.”\r\n\r\nHere with a sigh, as if her heart would break,\r\nShe throws forth Tarquin’s name: “He, he,” she says,\r\nBut more than “he” her poor tongue could not speak;\r\nTill after many accents and delays,\r\nUntimely breathings, sick and short assays,\r\n She utters this: “He, he, fair lords, ’tis he,\r\n That guides this hand to give this wound to me.”\r\n\r\nEven here she sheathed in her harmless breast\r\nA harmful knife, that thence her soul unsheathed.\r\nThat blow did bail it from the deep unrest\r\nOf that polluted prison where it breathed.\r\nHer contrite sighs unto the clouds bequeathed\r\n Her winged sprite, and through her wounds doth fly\r\n Life’s lasting date from cancelled destiny.\r\n\r\nStone-still, astonished with this deadly deed,\r\nStood Collatine and all his lordly crew,\r\nTill Lucrece’ father that beholds her bleed,\r\nHimself on her self-slaughtered body threw,\r\nAnd from the purple fountain Brutus drew\r\n The murd’rous knife, and, as it left the place,\r\n Her blood, in poor revenge, held it in chase;\r\n\r\nAnd bubbling from her breast, it doth divide\r\nIn two slow rivers, that the crimson blood\r\nCircles her body in on every side,\r\nWho, like a late-sacked island, vastly stood\r\nBare and unpeopled in this fearful flood.\r\n Some of her blood still pure and red remained,\r\n And some looked black, and that false Tarquin stained.\r\n\r\nAbout the mourning and congealed face\r\nOf that black blood a wat’ry rigol goes,\r\nWhich seems to weep upon the tainted place;\r\nAnd ever since, as pitying Lucrece’ woes,\r\nCorrupted blood some watery token shows,\r\n And blood untainted still doth red abide,\r\n Blushing at that which is so putrified.\r\n\r\n“Daughter, dear daughter,” old Lucretius cries,\r\n“That life was mine which thou hast here deprived.\r\nIf in the child the father’s image lies,\r\nWhere shall I live now Lucrece is unlived?\r\nThou wast not to this end from me derived.\r\n If children predecease progenitors,\r\n We are their offspring, and they none of ours.\r\n\r\n“Poor broken glass, I often did behold\r\nIn thy sweet semblance my old age new born;\r\nBut now that fair fresh mirror, dim and old,\r\nShows me a bare-boned death by time outworn.\r\nO, from thy cheeks my image thou hast torn,\r\n And shivered all the beauty of my glass,\r\n That I no more can see what once I was!\r\n\r\n“O time, cease thou thy course and last no longer,\r\nIf they surcease to be that should survive!\r\nShall rotten death make conquest of the stronger,\r\nAnd leave the falt’ring feeble souls alive?\r\nThe old bees die, the young possess their hive.\r\n Then live, sweet Lucrece, live again and see\r\n Thy father die, and not thy father thee!”\r\n\r\nBy this starts Collatine as from a dream,\r\nAnd bids Lucretius give his sorrow place;\r\nAnd then in key-cold Lucrece’ bleeding stream\r\nHe falls, and bathes the pale fear in his face,\r\nAnd counterfeits to die with her a space;\r\n Till manly shame bids him possess his breath,\r\n And live to be revenged on her death.\r\n\r\nThe deep vexation of his inward soul\r\nHath served a dumb arrest upon his tongue;\r\nWho, mad that sorrow should his use control\r\nOr keep him from heart-easing words so long,\r\nBegins to talk; but through his lips do throng\r\n Weak words, so thick come in his poor heart’s aid\r\n That no man could distinguish what he said.\r\n\r\nYet sometime “Tarquin” was pronounced plain,\r\nBut through his teeth, as if the name he tore.\r\nThis windy tempest, till it blow up rain,\r\nHeld back his sorrow’s tide, to make it more.\r\nAt last it rains, and busy winds give o’er.\r\n Then son and father weep with equal strife\r\n Who should weep most, for daughter or for wife.\r\n\r\nThe one doth call her his, the other his,\r\nYet neither may possess the claim they lay,\r\nThe father says “She’s mine.” “O, mine she is,”\r\nReplies her husband. “Do not take away\r\nMy sorrow’s interest; let no mourner say\r\n He weeps for her, for she was only mine,\r\n And only must be wailed by Collatine.”\r\n\r\n“O,” quoth Lucretius, “I did give that life\r\nWhich she too early and too late hath spilled.”\r\n“Woe, woe,” quoth Collatine, “she was my wife,\r\nI owed her, and ’tis mine that she hath killed.”\r\n“My daughter” and “my wife” with clamours filled\r\n The dispersed air, who, holding Lucrece’ life,\r\n Answered their cries, “my daughter” and “my wife”.\r\n\r\nBrutus, who plucked the knife from Lucrece’ side,\r\nSeeing such emulation in their woe,\r\nBegan to clothe his wit in state and pride,\r\nBurying in Lucrece’ wound his folly’s show.\r\nHe with the Romans was esteemed so\r\n As silly jeering idiots are with kings,\r\n For sportive words and utt’ring foolish things.\r\n\r\nBut now he throws that shallow habit by,\r\nWherein deep policy did him disguise,\r\nAnd armed his long-hid wits advisedly,\r\nTo check the tears in Collatinus’ eyes.\r\n“Thou wronged lord of Rome,” quoth he, “arise!\r\n Let my unsounded self, supposed a fool,\r\n Now set thy long-experienced wit to school.\r\n\r\n“Why, Collatine, is woe the cure for woe?\r\nDo wounds help wounds, or grief help grievous deeds?\r\nIs it revenge to give thyself a blow\r\nFor his foul act by whom thy fair wife bleeds?\r\nSuch childish humour from weak minds proceeds.\r\n Thy wretched wife mistook the matter so,\r\n To slay herself, that should have slain her foe.\r\n\r\n“Courageous Roman, do not steep thy heart\r\nIn such relenting dew of lamentations,\r\nBut kneel with me, and help to bear thy part\r\nTo rouse our Roman gods with invocations,\r\nThat they will suffer these abominations,—\r\n Since Rome herself in them doth stand disgraced,—\r\n By our strong arms from forth her fair streets chased.\r\n\r\n“Now, by the Capitol that we adore,\r\nAnd by this chaste blood so unjustly stained,\r\nBy heaven’s fair sun that breeds the fat earth’s store,\r\nBy all our country rights in Rome maintained,\r\nAnd by chaste Lucrece’ soul that late complained\r\n Her wrongs to us, and by this bloody knife,\r\n We will revenge the death of this true wife.”\r\n\r\nThis said, he struck his hand upon his breast,\r\nAnd kissed the fatal knife, to end his vow;\r\nAnd to his protestation urged the rest,\r\nWho, wond’ring at him, did his words allow.\r\nThen jointly to the ground their knees they bow,\r\n And that deep vow which Brutus made before,\r\n He doth again repeat, and that they swore.\r\n\r\nWhen they had sworn to this advised doom,\r\nThey did conclude to bear dead Lucrece thence,\r\nTo show her bleeding body thorough Rome,\r\nAnd so to publish Tarquin’s foul offence;\r\nWhich being done with speedy diligence,\r\n The Romans plausibly did give consent\r\n To Tarquin’s everlasting banishment.\r\n\nVENUS AND ADONIS\r\n\n _Vilia miretur vulgus; mihi flavus Apollo\r\n Pocula Castalia plena ministret aqua._\r\n\nTO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE\r\nHENRY WRIOTHESLEY, EARL OF SOUTHAMPTON,\r\nand Baron of Titchfield.\r\n\r\nRight Honourable, I know not how I shall offend in dedicating my\r\nunpolished lines to your lordship, nor how the world will censure me\r\nfor choosing so strong a prop to support so weak a burthen: only, if\r\nyour honour seem but pleased, I account myself highly praised, and vow\r\nto take advantage of all idle hours, till I have honoured you with some\r\ngraver labour. But if the first heir of my invention prove deformed, I\r\nshall be sorry it had so noble a godfather, and never after ear so\r\nbarren a land, for fear it yield me still so bad a harvest. I leave it\r\nto your honourable survey, and your honour to your heart’s content;\r\nwhich I wish may always answer your own wish and the world’s hopeful\r\nexpectation.\r\n\r\nYour honour’s in all duty,\r\nWILLIAM SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\nVENUS AND ADONIS\r\n\r\nEven as the sun with purple-colour’d face\r\nHad ta’en his last leave of the weeping morn,\r\nRose-cheek’d Adonis tried him to the chase;\r\nHunting he lov’d, but love he laugh’d to scorn; 4\r\n Sick-thoughted Venus makes amain unto him,\r\n And like a bold-fac’d suitor ’gins to woo him.\r\n\r\n“Thrice fairer than myself,” thus she began,\r\n“The field’s chief flower, sweet above compare, 8\r\nStain to all nymphs, more lovely than a man,\r\nMore white and red than doves or roses are:\r\n Nature that made thee, with herself at strife,\r\n Saith that the world hath ending with thy life. 12\r\n\r\n“Vouchsafe, thou wonder, to alight thy steed,\r\nAnd rein his proud head to the saddle-bow;\r\nIf thou wilt deign this favour, for thy meed\r\nA thousand honey secrets shalt thou know: 16\r\n Here come and sit, where never serpent hisses,\r\n And being set, I’ll smother thee with kisses.\r\n\r\n“And yet not cloy thy lips with loath’d satiety,\r\nBut rather famish them amid their plenty, 20\r\nMaking them red, and pale, with fresh variety:\r\nTen kisses short as one, one long as twenty:\r\n A summer’s day will seem an hour but short,\r\n Being wasted in such time-beguiling sport.” 24\r\n\r\nWith this she seizeth on his sweating palm,\r\nThe precedent of pith and livelihood,\r\nAnd trembling in her passion, calls it balm,\r\nEarth’s sovereign salve to do a goddess good: 28\r\n Being so enrag’d, desire doth lend her force\r\n Courageously to pluck him from his horse.\r\n\r\nOver one arm the lusty courser’s rein,\r\nUnder her other was the tender boy, 32\r\nWho blush’d and pouted in a dull disdain,\r\nWith leaden appetite, unapt to toy;\r\n She red and hot as coals of glowing fire,\r\n He red for shame, but frosty in desire. 36\r\n\r\nThe studded bridle on a ragged bough\r\nNimbly she fastens;—O! how quick is love!—\r\nThe steed is stalled up, and even now\r\nTo tie the rider she begins to prove: 40\r\n Backward she push’d him, as she would be thrust,\r\n And govern’d him in strength, though not in lust.\r\n\r\nSo soon was she along, as he was down,\r\nEach leaning on their elbows and their hips: 44\r\nNow doth she stroke his cheek, now doth he frown,\r\nAnd ’gins to chide, but soon she stops his lips,\r\n And kissing speaks, with lustful language broken,\r\n “If thou wilt chide, thy lips shall never open.” 48\r\n\r\nHe burns with bashful shame, she with her tears\r\nDoth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks;\r\nThen with her windy sighs and golden hairs\r\nTo fan and blow them dry again she seeks. 52\r\n He saith she is immodest, blames her miss;\r\n What follows more, she murders with a kiss.\r\n\r\nEven as an empty eagle, sharp by fast,\r\nTires with her beak on feathers, flesh and bone, 56\r\nShaking her wings, devouring all in haste,\r\nTill either gorge be stuff’d or prey be gone:\r\n Even so she kiss’d his brow, his cheek, his chin,\r\n And where she ends she doth anew begin. 60\r\n\r\nForc’d to content, but never to obey,\r\nPanting he lies, and breatheth in her face.\r\nShe feedeth on the steam, as on a prey,\r\nAnd calls it heavenly moisture, air of grace, 64\r\n Wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers\r\n So they were dew’d with such distilling showers.\r\n\r\nLook how a bird lies tangled in a net,\r\nSo fasten’d in her arms Adonis lies; 68\r\nPure shame and aw’d resistance made him fret,\r\nWhich bred more beauty in his angry eyes:\r\n Rain added to a river that is rank\r\n Perforce will force it overflow the bank. 72\r\n\r\nStill she entreats, and prettily entreats,\r\nFor to a pretty ear she tunes her tale.\r\nStill is he sullen, still he lours and frets,\r\n’Twixt crimson shame and anger ashy pale; 76\r\n Being red she loves him best, and being white,\r\n Her best is better’d with a more delight.\r\n\r\nLook how he can, she cannot choose but love;\r\nAnd by her fair immortal hand she swears, 80\r\nFrom his soft bosom never to remove,\r\nTill he take truce with her contending tears,\r\n Which long have rain’d, making her cheeks all wet;\r\n And one sweet kiss shall pay this countless debt.\r\n\r\nUpon this promise did he raise his chin, 85\r\nLike a dive-dapper peering through a wave,\r\nWho, being look’d on, ducks as quickly in;\r\nSo offers he to give what she did crave, 88\r\n But when her lips were ready for his pay,\r\n He winks, and turns his lips another way.\r\n\r\nNever did passenger in summer’s heat\r\nMore thirst for drink than she for this good turn. 92\r\nHer help she sees, but help she cannot get;\r\nShe bathes in water, yet her fire must burn:\r\n “O! pity,” ’gan she cry, “flint-hearted boy,\r\n ’Tis but a kiss I beg; why art thou coy? 96\r\n\r\n“I have been woo’d as I entreat thee now,\r\nEven by the stern and direful god of war,\r\nWhose sinewy neck in battle ne’er did bow,\r\nWho conquers where he comes in every jar; 100\r\n Yet hath he been my captive and my slave,\r\n And begg’d for that which thou unask’d shalt have.\r\n\r\n“Over my altars hath he hung his lance,\r\nHis batter’d shield, his uncontrolled crest, 104\r\nAnd for my sake hath learn’d to sport and dance,\r\nTo toy, to wanton, dally, smile, and jest;\r\n Scorning his churlish drum and ensign red\r\n Making my arms his field, his tent my bed. 108\r\n\r\n“Thus he that overrul’d I oversway’d,\r\nLeading him prisoner in a red rose chain:\r\nStrong-temper’d steel his stronger strength obey’d,\r\nYet was he servile to my coy disdain. 112\r\n Oh be not proud, nor brag not of thy might,\r\n For mast’ring her that foil’d the god of fight.\r\n\r\n“Touch but my lips with those fair lips of thine,\r\nThough mine be not so fair, yet are they red, 116\r\nThe kiss shall be thine own as well as mine:\r\nWhat see’st thou in the ground? hold up thy head,\r\n Look in mine eyeballs, there thy beauty lies;\r\n Then why not lips on lips, since eyes in eyes? 120\r\n\r\n“Art thou asham’d to kiss? then wink again,\r\nAnd I will wink; so shall the day seem night.\r\nLove keeps his revels where there are but twain;\r\nBe bold to play, our sport is not in sight, 124\r\n These blue-vein’d violets whereon we lean\r\n Never can blab, nor know not what we mean.\r\n\r\n“The tender spring upon thy tempting lip 127\r\nShows thee unripe; yet mayst thou well be tasted,\r\nMake use of time, let not advantage slip;\r\nBeauty within itself should not be wasted,\r\n Fair flowers that are not gather’d in their prime\r\n Rot, and consume themselves in little time. 132\r\n\r\n“Were I hard-favour’d, foul, or wrinkled old,\r\nIll-nurtur’d, crooked, churlish, harsh in voice,\r\nO’erworn, despised, rheumatic, and cold,\r\nThick-sighted, barren, lean, and lacking juice, 136\r\n Then mightst thou pause, for then I were not for thee;\r\n But having no defects, why dost abhor me?\r\n\r\n“Thou canst not see one wrinkle in my brow, 139\r\nMine eyes are grey and bright, and quick in turning;\r\nMy beauty as the spring doth yearly grow,\r\nMy flesh is soft and plump, my marrow burning,\r\n My smooth moist hand, were it with thy hand felt,\r\n Would in thy palm dissolve, or seem to melt. 144\r\n\r\n“Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear,\r\nOr like a fairy, trip upon the green,\r\nOr like a nymph, with long dishevell’d hair,\r\nDance on the sands, and yet no footing seen. 148\r\n Love is a spirit all compact of fire,\r\n Not gross to sink, but light, and will aspire.\r\n\r\n“Witness this primrose bank whereon I lie: 151\r\nThese forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me;\r\nTwo strengthless doves will draw me through the sky,\r\nFrom morn till night, even where I list to sport me.\r\n Is love so light, sweet boy, and may it be\r\n That thou shouldst think it heavy unto thee? 156\r\n\r\n“Is thine own heart to thine own face affected?\r\nCan thy right hand seize love upon thy left?\r\nThen woo thyself, be of thyself rejected,\r\nSteal thine own freedom, and complain on theft. 160\r\n Narcissus so himself himself forsook,\r\n And died to kiss his shadow in the brook.\r\n\r\n“Torches are made to light, jewels to wear,\r\nDainties to taste, fresh beauty for the use, 164\r\nHerbs for their smell, and sappy plants to bear;\r\nThings growing to themselves are growth’s abuse,\r\n Seeds spring from seeds, and beauty breedeth beauty;\r\n Thou wast begot; to get it is thy duty. 168\r\n\r\n“Upon the earth’s increase why shouldst thou feed,\r\nUnless the earth with thy increase be fed?\r\nBy law of nature thou art bound to breed,\r\nThat thine may live when thou thyself art dead; 172\r\n And so in spite of death thou dost survive,\r\n In that thy likeness still is left alive.”\r\n\r\nBy this the love-sick queen began to sweat,\r\nFor where they lay the shadow had forsook them, 176\r\nAnd Titan, tired in the midday heat,\r\nWith burning eye did hotly overlook them,\r\n Wishing Adonis had his team to guide,\r\n So he were like him and by Venus’ side. 180\r\n\r\nAnd now Adonis with a lazy spright,\r\nAnd with a heavy, dark, disliking eye,\r\nHis louring brows o’erwhelming his fair sight,\r\nLike misty vapours when they blot the sky, 184\r\n Souring his cheeks, cries, “Fie, no more of love:\r\n The sun doth burn my face; I must remove.”\r\n\r\n“Ay me,” quoth Venus, “young, and so unkind!\r\nWhat bare excuses mak’st thou to be gone! 188\r\nI’ll sigh celestial breath, whose gentle wind\r\nShall cool the heat of this descending sun:\r\n I’ll make a shadow for thee of my hairs;\r\n If they burn too, I’ll quench them with my tears. 192\r\n\r\n“The sun that shines from heaven shines but warm,\r\nAnd lo I lie between that sun and thee:\r\nThe heat I have from thence doth little harm,\r\nThine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me; 196\r\n And were I not immortal, life were done,\r\n Between this heavenly and earthly sun.\r\n\r\n“Art thou obdurate, flinty, hard as steel?\r\nNay more than flint, for stone at rain relenteth: 200\r\nArt thou a woman’s son and canst not feel\r\nWhat ’tis to love, how want of love tormenteth?\r\n O had thy mother borne so hard a mind,\r\n She had not brought forth thee, but died unkind. 204\r\n\r\n“What am I that thou shouldst contemn me this?\r\nOr what great danger dwells upon my suit?\r\nWhat were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss?\r\nSpeak, fair; but speak fair words, or else be mute: 208\r\n Give me one kiss, I’ll give it thee again,\r\n And one for int’rest, if thou wilt have twain.\r\n\r\n“Fie, lifeless picture, cold and senseless stone,\r\nWell-painted idol, image dull and dead, 212\r\nStatue contenting but the eye alone,\r\nThing like a man, but of no woman bred:\r\n Thou art no man, though of a man’s complexion,\r\n For men will kiss even by their own direction.” 216\r\n\r\nThis said, impatience chokes her pleading tongue,\r\nAnd swelling passion doth provoke a pause;\r\nRed cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth her wrong;\r\nBeing judge in love, she cannot right her cause. 220\r\n And now she weeps, and now she fain would speak,\r\n And now her sobs do her intendments break.\r\n\r\nSometimes she shakes her head, and then his hand,\r\nNow gazeth she on him, now on the ground; 224\r\nSometimes her arms infold him like a band:\r\nShe would, he will not in her arms be bound;\r\n And when from thence he struggles to be gone,\r\n She locks her lily fingers one in one. 228\r\n\r\n“Fondling,” she saith, “since I have hemm’d thee here\r\nWithin the circuit of this ivory pale,\r\nI’ll be a park, and thou shalt be my deer;\r\nFeed where thou wilt, on mountain or in dale: 232\r\n Graze on my lips, and if those hills be dry,\r\n Stray lower, where the pleasant fountains lie.\r\n\r\n“Within this limit is relief enough,\r\nSweet bottom grass and high delightful plain, 236\r\nRound rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,\r\nTo shelter thee from tempest and from rain:\r\n Then be my deer, since I am such a park, 239\r\n No dog shall rouse thee, though a thousand bark.”\r\n\r\nAt this Adonis smiles as in disdain,\r\nThat in each cheek appears a pretty dimple;\r\nLove made those hollows, if himself were slain,\r\nHe might be buried in a tomb so simple; 244\r\n Foreknowing well, if there he came to lie,\r\n Why there love liv’d, and there he could not die.\r\n\r\nThese lovely caves, these round enchanting pits,\r\nOpen’d their mouths to swallow Venus’ liking. 248\r\nBeing mad before, how doth she now for wits?\r\nStruck dead at first, what needs a second striking?\r\n Poor queen of love, in thine own law forlorn,\r\n To love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn! 252\r\n\r\nNow which way shall she turn? what shall she say?\r\nHer words are done, her woes the more increasing;\r\nThe time is spent, her object will away,\r\nAnd from her twining arms doth urge releasing: 256\r\n “Pity,” she cries; “some favour, some remorse!”\r\n Away he springs, and hasteth to his horse.\r\n\r\nBut lo from forth a copse that neighbours by,\r\nA breeding jennet, lusty, young, and proud, 260\r\nAdonis’ tramping courser doth espy,\r\nAnd forth she rushes, snorts and neighs aloud:\r\n The strong-neck’d steed, being tied unto a tree,\r\n Breaketh his rein, and to her straight goes he. 264\r\n\r\nImperiously he leaps, he neighs, he bounds,\r\nAnd now his woven girths he breaks asunder;\r\nThe bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds,\r\nWhose hollow womb resounds like heaven’s thunder;\r\n The iron bit he crusheth ’tween his teeth, 269\r\n Controlling what he was controlled with.\r\n\r\nHis ears up-prick’d; his braided hanging mane\r\nUpon his compass’d crest now stand on end; 272\r\nHis nostrils drink the air, and forth again,\r\nAs from a furnace, vapours doth he send:\r\n His eye, which scornfully glisters like fire,\r\n Shows his hot courage and his high desire. 276\r\n\r\nSometime he trots, as if he told the steps,\r\nWith gentle majesty and modest pride;\r\nAnon he rears upright, curvets and leaps,\r\nAs who should say, “Lo thus my strength is tried;\r\n And this I do to captivate the eye 281\r\n Of the fair breeder that is standing by.”\r\n\r\nWhat recketh he his rider’s angry stir,\r\nHis flattering “Holla”, or his “Stand, I say”? 284\r\nWhat cares he now for curb or pricking spur?\r\nFor rich caparisons or trappings gay?\r\n He sees his love, and nothing else he sees,\r\n Nor nothing else with his proud sight agrees. 288\r\n\r\nLook when a painter would surpass the life,\r\nIn limning out a well-proportion’d steed,\r\nHis art with nature’s workmanship at strife,\r\nAs if the dead the living should exceed: 292\r\n So did this horse excel a common one,\r\n In shape, in courage, colour, pace and bone.\r\n\r\nRound-hoof’d, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,\r\nBroad breast, full eye, small head, and nostril wide,\r\nHigh crest, short ears, straight legs and passing strong,\r\nThin mane, thick tail, broad buttock, tender hide:\r\n Look, what a horse should have he did not lack,\r\n Save a proud rider on so proud a back. 300\r\n\r\nSometimes he scuds far off, and there he stares;\r\nAnon he starts at stirring of a feather:\r\nTo bid the wind a base he now prepares,\r\nAnd where he run or fly they know not whether; 304\r\n For through his mane and tail the high wind sings,\r\n Fanning the hairs, who wave like feather’d wings.\r\n\r\nHe looks upon his love, and neighs unto her;\r\nShe answers him as if she knew his mind, 308\r\nBeing proud, as females are, to see him woo her,\r\nShe puts on outward strangeness, seems unkind,\r\n Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels,\r\n Beating his kind embracements with her heels. 312\r\n\r\nThen like a melancholy malcontent,\r\nHe vails his tail that like a falling plume,\r\nCool shadow to his melting buttock lent:\r\nHe stamps, and bites the poor flies in his fume. 316\r\n His love, perceiving how he was enrag’d,\r\n Grew kinder, and his fury was assuag’d.\r\n\r\nHis testy master goeth about to take him,\r\nWhen lo the unback’d breeder, full of fear, 320\r\nJealous of catching, swiftly doth forsake him,\r\nWith her the horse, and left Adonis there:\r\n As they were mad, unto the wood they hie them,\r\n Outstripping crows that strive to overfly them. 324\r\n\r\nAll swoln with chafing, down Adonis sits,\r\nBanning his boisterous and unruly beast;\r\nAnd now the happy season once more fits\r\nThat love-sick love by pleading may be blest; 328\r\n For lovers say, the heart hath treble wrong,\r\n When it is barr’d the aidance of the tongue.\r\n\r\nAn oven that is stopp’d, or river stay’d,\r\nBurneth more hotly, swelleth with more rage: 332\r\nSo of concealed sorrow may be said,\r\nFree vent of words love’s fire doth assuage;\r\n But when the heart’s attorney once is mute,\r\n The client breaks, as desperate in his suit. 336\r\n\r\nHe sees her coming, and begins to glow,\r\nEven as a dying coal revives with wind,\r\nAnd with his bonnet hides his angry brow,\r\nLooks on the dull earth with disturbed mind, 340\r\n Taking no notice that she is so nigh,\r\n For all askance he holds her in his eye.\r\n\r\nO what a sight it was, wistly to view\r\nHow she came stealing to the wayward boy, 344\r\nTo note the fighting conflict of her hue,\r\nHow white and red each other did destroy:\r\n But now her cheek was pale, and by and by\r\n It flash’d forth fire, as lightning from the sky. 348\r\n\r\nNow was she just before him as he sat,\r\nAnd like a lowly lover down she kneels;\r\nWith one fair hand she heaveth up his hat,\r\nHer other tender hand his fair cheek feels: 352\r\n His tend’rer cheek receives her soft hand’s print,\r\n As apt as new-fall’n snow takes any dint.\r\n\r\nOh what a war of looks was then between them,\r\nHer eyes petitioners to his eyes suing, 356\r\nHis eyes saw her eyes, as they had not seen them,\r\nHer eyes woo’d still, his eyes disdain’d the wooing:\r\n And all this dumb play had his acts made plain\r\n With tears, which, chorus-like, her eyes did rain.\r\n\r\nFull gently now she takes him by the hand, 361\r\nA lily prison’d in a gaol of snow,\r\nOr ivory in an alabaster band,\r\nSo white a friend engirts so white a foe: 364\r\n This beauteous combat, wilful and unwilling,\r\n Show’d like two silver doves that sit a-billing.\r\n\r\nOnce more the engine of her thoughts began:\r\n“O fairest mover on this mortal round, 368\r\nWould thou wert as I am, and I a man,\r\nMy heart all whole as thine, thy heart my wound,\r\n For one sweet look thy help I would assure thee,\r\n Though nothing but my body’s bane would cure thee.”\r\n\r\n“Give me my hand,” saith he, “why dost thou feel it?”\r\n“Give me my heart,” saith she, “and thou shalt have it.\r\nO give it me lest thy hard heart do steel it,\r\nAnd being steel’d, soft sighs can never grave it. 376\r\n Then love’s deep groans I never shall regard,\r\n Because Adonis’ heart hath made mine hard.”\r\n\r\n“For shame,” he cries, “let go, and let me go,\r\nMy day’s delight is past, my horse is gone, 380\r\nAnd ’tis your fault I am bereft him so,\r\nI pray you hence, and leave me here alone,\r\n For all my mind, my thought, my busy care,\r\n Is how to get my palfrey from the mare.” 384\r\n\r\nThus she replies: “Thy palfrey as he should,\r\nWelcomes the warm approach of sweet desire,\r\nAffection is a coal that must be cool’d;\r\nElse, suffer’d, it will set the heart on fire, 388\r\n The sea hath bounds, but deep desire hath none;\r\n Therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone.\r\n\r\n“How like a jade he stood tied to the tree,\r\nServilely master’d with a leathern rein! 392\r\nBut when he saw his love, his youth’s fair fee,\r\nHe held such petty bondage in disdain;\r\n Throwing the base thong from his bending crest,\r\n Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast. 396\r\n\r\n“Who sees his true-love in her naked bed,\r\nTeaching the sheets a whiter hue than white,\r\nBut when his glutton eye so full hath fed,\r\nHis other agents aim at like delight? 400\r\n Who is so faint that dare not be so bold\r\n To touch the fire, the weather being cold?\r\n\r\n“Let me excuse thy courser, gentle boy,\r\nAnd learn of him, I heartily beseech thee, 404\r\nTo take advantage on presented joy,\r\nThough I were dumb, yet his proceedings teach thee.\r\n O learn to love, the lesson is but plain,\r\n And once made perfect, never lost again.” 408\r\n\r\n“I know not love,” quoth he, “nor will not know it,\r\nUnless it be a boar, and then I chase it;\r\n’Tis much to borrow, and I will not owe it;\r\nMy love to love is love but to disgrace it; 412\r\n For I have heard, it is a life in death,\r\n That laughs and weeps, and all but with a breath.\r\n\r\n“Who wears a garment shapeless and unfinish’d?\r\nWho plucks the bud before one leaf put forth? 416\r\nIf springing things be any jot diminish’d,\r\nThey wither in their prime, prove nothing worth;\r\n The colt that’s back’d and burden’d being young,\r\n Loseth his pride, and never waxeth strong. 420\r\n\r\n“You hurt my hand with wringing. Let us part,\r\nAnd leave this idle theme, this bootless chat:\r\nRemove your siege from my unyielding heart,\r\nTo love’s alarms it will not ope the gate: 424\r\n Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flatt’ry;\r\n For where a heart is hard they make no batt’ry.”\r\n\r\n“What! canst thou talk?” quoth she, “hast thou a tongue?\r\nO would thou hadst not, or I had no hearing; 428\r\nThy mermaid’s voice hath done me double wrong;\r\nI had my load before, now press’d with bearing:\r\n Melodious discord, heavenly tune, harsh-sounding,\r\n Ear’s deep sweet music, and heart’s deep sore wounding.\r\n\r\n“Had I no eyes but ears, my ears would love 433\r\nThat inward beauty and invisible;\r\nOr were I deaf, thy outward parts would move\r\nEach part in me that were but sensible: 436\r\n Though neither eyes nor ears, to hear nor see,\r\n Yet should I be in love by touching thee.\r\n\r\n“Say that the sense of feeling were bereft me,\r\nAnd that I could not see, nor hear, nor touch, 440\r\nAnd nothing but the very smell were left me,\r\nYet would my love to thee be still as much;\r\n For from the stillitory of thy face excelling\r\n Comes breath perfum’d, that breedeth love by smelling.\r\n\r\n“But oh what banquet wert thou to the taste, 445\r\nBeing nurse and feeder of the other four;\r\nWould they not wish the feast might ever last,\r\nAnd bid suspicion double-lock the door,\r\n Lest jealousy, that sour unwelcome guest,\r\n Should by his stealing in disturb the feast?” 448\r\n\r\nOnce more the ruby-colour’d portal open’d,\r\nWhich to his speech did honey passage yield, 452\r\nLike a red morn that ever yet betoken’d\r\nWrack to the seaman, tempest to the field,\r\n Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,\r\n Gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds. 456\r\n\r\nThis ill presage advisedly she marketh:\r\nEven as the wind is hush’d before it raineth,\r\nOr as the wolf doth grin before he barketh,\r\nOr as the berry breaks before it staineth, 460\r\n Or like the deadly bullet of a gun,\r\n His meaning struck her ere his words begun.\r\n\r\nAnd at his look she flatly falleth down\r\nFor looks kill love, and love by looks reviveth; 464\r\nA smile recures the wounding of a frown;\r\nBut blessed bankrout, that by love so thriveth!\r\n The silly boy, believing she is dead,\r\n Claps her pale cheek, till clapping makes it red. 468\r\n\r\nAnd all amaz’d brake off his late intent,\r\nFor sharply he did think to reprehend her,\r\nWhich cunning love did wittily prevent:\r\nFair fall the wit that can so well defend her! 472\r\n For on the grass she lies as she were slain,\r\n Till his breath breatheth life in her again.\r\n\r\nHe wrings her nose, he strikes her on the cheeks,\r\nHe bends her fingers, holds her pulses hard, 476\r\nHe chafes her lips; a thousand ways he seeks\r\nTo mend the hurt that his unkindness marr’d:\r\n He kisses her; and she, by her good will,\r\n Will never rise, so he will kiss her still. 480\r\n\r\nThe night of sorrow now is turn’d to day:\r\nHer two blue windows faintly she up-heaveth,\r\nLike the fair sun when in his fresh array\r\nHe cheers the morn, and all the world relieveth: 484\r\n And as the bright sun glorifies the sky,\r\n So is her face illumin’d with her eye.\r\n\r\nWhose beams upon his hairless face are fix’d,\r\nAs if from thence they borrow’d all their shine. 488\r\nWere never four such lamps together mix’d,\r\nHad not his clouded with his brow’s repine;\r\n But hers, which through the crystal tears gave light\r\n Shone like the moon in water seen by night. 492\r\n\r\n“O where am I?” quoth she, “in earth or heaven?\r\nOr in the ocean drench’d, or in the fire?\r\nWhat hour is this? or morn or weary even?\r\nDo I delight to die, or life desire? 496\r\n But now I liv’d, and life was death’s annoy;\r\n But now I died, and death was lively joy.\r\n\r\n“O thou didst kill me; kill me once again:\r\nThy eyes’ shrewd tutor, that hard heart of thine, 500\r\nHath taught them scornful tricks, and such disdain,\r\nThat they have murder’d this poor heart of mine;\r\n And these mine eyes, true leaders to their queen,\r\n But for thy piteous lips no more had seen. 504\r\n\r\n“Long may they kiss each other for this cure!\r\nOh never let their crimson liveries wear,\r\nAnd as they last, their verdure still endure,\r\nTo drive infection from the dangerous year: 508\r\n That the star-gazers, having writ on death,\r\n May say, the plague is banish’d by thy breath.\r\n\r\n“Pure lips, sweet seals in my soft lips imprinted,\r\nWhat bargains may I make, still to be sealing? 512\r\nTo sell myself I can be well contented,\r\nSo thou wilt buy, and pay, and use good dealing;\r\n Which purchase if thou make, for fear of slips,\r\n Set thy seal manual on my wax-red lips. 516\r\n\r\n“A thousand kisses buys my heart from me;\r\nAnd pay them at thy leisure, one by one,\r\nWhat is ten hundred touches unto thee?\r\nAre they not quickly told and quickly gone? 520\r\n Say, for non-payment that the debt should double,\r\n Is twenty hundred kisses such a trouble?”\r\n\r\n“Fair queen,” quoth he, “if any love you owe me,\r\nMeasure my strangeness with my unripe years: 524\r\nBefore I know myself, seek not to know me;\r\nNo fisher but the ungrown fry forbears:\r\n The mellow plum doth fall, the green sticks fast,\r\n Or being early pluck’d, is sour to taste. 528\r\n\r\n“Look the world’s comforter, with weary gait\r\nHis day’s hot task hath ended in the west;\r\nThe owl, night’s herald, shrieks, ’tis very late;\r\nThe sheep are gone to fold, birds to their nest, 532\r\n And coal-black clouds that shadow heaven’s light\r\n Do summon us to part, and bid good night.\r\n\r\n“Now let me say good night, and so say you;\r\nIf you will say so, you shall have a kiss.” 536\r\n“Good night,” quoth she; and ere he says adieu,\r\nThe honey fee of parting tender’d is:\r\n Her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace;\r\n Incorporate then they seem, face grows to face. 540\r\n\r\nTill breathless he disjoin’d, and backward drew\r\nThe heavenly moisture, that sweet coral mouth,\r\nWhose precious taste her thirsty lips well knew,\r\nWhereon they surfeit, yet complain on drouth, 544\r\n He with her plenty press’d, she faint with dearth,\r\n Their lips together glued, fall to the earth.\r\n\r\nNow quick desire hath caught the yielding prey,\r\nAnd glutton-like she feeds, yet never filleth; 548\r\nHer lips are conquerors, his lips obey,\r\nPaying what ransom the insulter willeth;\r\n Whose vulture thought doth pitch the price so high,\r\n That she will draw his lips’ rich treasure dry. 552\r\n\r\nAnd having felt the sweetness of the spoil,\r\nWith blindfold fury she begins to forage;\r\nHer face doth reek and smoke, her blood doth boil,\r\nAnd careless lust stirs up a desperate courage, 556\r\n Planting oblivion, beating reason back,\r\n Forgetting shame’s pure blush and honour’s wrack.\r\n\r\nHot, faint, and weary, with her hard embracing,\r\nLike a wild bird being tam’d with too much handling,\r\nOr as the fleet-foot roe that’s tir’d with chasing, 561\r\nOr like the froward infant still’d with dandling:\r\n He now obeys, and now no more resisteth,\r\n While she takes all she can, not all she listeth. 564\r\n\r\nWhat wax so frozen but dissolves with temp’ring,\r\nAnd yields at last to every light impression?\r\nThings out of hope are compass’d oft with vent’ring,\r\nChiefly in love, whose leave exceeds commission: 568\r\n Affection faints not like a pale-fac’d coward,\r\n But then woos best when most his choice is froward.\r\n\r\nWhen he did frown, O had she then gave over,\r\nSuch nectar from his lips she had not suck’d. 572\r\nFoul words and frowns must not repel a lover;\r\nWhat though the rose have prickles, yet ’tis pluck’d.\r\n Were beauty under twenty locks kept fast,\r\n Yet love breaks through, and picks them all at last.\r\n\r\nFor pity now she can no more detain him; 577\r\nThe poor fool prays her that he may depart:\r\nShe is resolv’d no longer to restrain him,\r\nBids him farewell, and look well to her heart, 580\r\n The which by Cupid’s bow she doth protest,\r\n He carries thence encaged in his breast.\r\n\r\n“Sweet boy,” she says, “this night I’ll waste in sorrow,\r\nFor my sick heart commands mine eyes to watch. 584\r\nTell me, love’s master, shall we meet tomorrow\r\nSay, shall we? shall we? wilt thou make the match?”\r\n He tells her no, tomorrow he intends\r\n To hunt the boar with certain of his friends. 588\r\n\r\n“The boar!” quoth she; whereat a sudden pale,\r\nLike lawn being spread upon the blushing rose,\r\nUsurps her cheek, she trembles at his tale,\r\nAnd on his neck her yoking arms she throws. 592\r\n She sinketh down, still hanging by his neck,\r\n He on her belly falls, she on her back.\r\n\r\nNow is she in the very lists of love,\r\nHer champion mounted for the hot encounter: 596\r\nAll is imaginary she doth prove,\r\nHe will not manage her, although he mount her;\r\n That worse than Tantalus’ is her annoy,\r\n To clip Elysium and to lack her joy. 600\r\n\r\nEven as poor birds, deceiv’d with painted grapes,\r\nDo surfeit by the eye and pine the maw:\r\nEven so she languisheth in her mishaps,\r\nAs those poor birds that helpless berries saw. 604\r\n The warm effects which she in him finds missing,\r\n She seeks to kindle with continual kissing.\r\n\r\nBut all in vain, good queen, it will not be,\r\nShe hath assay’d as much as may be prov’d; 608\r\nHer pleading hath deserv’d a greater fee;\r\nShe’s love, she loves, and yet she is not lov’d.\r\n “Fie, fie,” he says, “you crush me; let me go;\r\n You have no reason to withhold me so.” 612\r\n\r\n“Thou hadst been gone,” quoth she, “sweet boy, ere this,\r\nBut that thou told’st me thou wouldst hunt the boar.\r\nOh be advis’d; thou know’st not what it is,\r\nWith javelin’s point a churlish swine to gore, 616\r\n Whose tushes never sheath’d he whetteth still,\r\n Like to a mortal butcher, bent to kill.\r\n\r\n“On his bow-back he hath a battle set\r\nOf bristly pikes, that ever threat his foes; 620\r\nHis eyes like glow-worms shine when he doth fret;\r\nHis snout digs sepulchres where’er he goes;\r\n Being mov’d, he strikes whate’er is in his way,\r\n And whom he strikes his crooked tushes slay. 624\r\n\r\n“His brawny sides, with hairy bristles armed,\r\nAre better proof than thy spear’s point can enter;\r\nHis short thick neck cannot be easily harmed;\r\nBeing ireful, on the lion he will venture: 628\r\n The thorny brambles and embracing bushes,\r\n As fearful of him, part, through whom he rushes.\r\n\r\n“Alas! he naught esteems that face of thine,\r\nTo which love’s eyes pay tributary gazes; 632\r\nNor thy soft hands, sweet lips, and crystal eyne,\r\nWhose full perfection all the world amazes;\r\n But having thee at vantage, wondrous dread!\r\n Would root these beauties as he roots the mead.\r\n\r\n“Oh let him keep his loathsome cabin still, 637\r\nBeauty hath naught to do with such foul fiends:\r\nCome not within his danger by thy will;\r\nThey that thrive well, take counsel of their friends.\r\n When thou didst name the boar, not to dissemble,\r\n I fear’d thy fortune, and my joints did tremble.\r\n\r\n“Didst thou not mark my face, was it not white?\r\nSaw’st thou not signs of fear lurk in mine eye? 644\r\nGrew I not faint, and fell I not downright?\r\nWithin my bosom, whereon thou dost lie,\r\n My boding heart pants, beats, and takes no rest,\r\n But like an earthquake, shakes thee on my breast.\r\n\r\n“For where love reigns, disturbing jealousy 649\r\nDoth call himself affection’s sentinel;\r\nGives false alarms, suggesteth mutiny,\r\nAnd in a peaceful hour doth cry “Kill, kill!” 652\r\n Distemp’ring gentle love in his desire,\r\n As air and water do abate the fire.\r\n\r\n“This sour informer, this bate-breeding spy,\r\nThis canker that eats up love’s tender spring, 656\r\nThis carry-tale, dissentious jealousy,\r\nThat sometime true news, sometime false doth bring,\r\n Knocks at my heart, and whispers in mine ear,\r\n That if I love thee, I thy death should fear. 660\r\n\r\n“And more than so, presenteth to mine eye\r\nThe picture of an angry chafing boar,\r\nUnder whose sharp fangs on his back doth lie\r\nAn image like thyself, all stain’d with gore; 664\r\n Whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed,\r\n Doth make them droop with grief and hang the head.\r\n\r\n“What should I do, seeing thee so indeed,\r\nThat tremble at th’imagination? 668\r\nThe thought of it doth make my faint heart bleed,\r\nAnd fear doth teach it divination:\r\n I prophesy thy death, my living sorrow,\r\n If thou encounter with the boar tomorrow. 672\r\n\r\n“But if thou needs wilt hunt, be rul’d by me;\r\nUncouple at the timorous flying hare,\r\nOr at the fox which lives by subtilty,\r\nOr at the roe which no encounter dare: 676\r\n Pursue these fearful creatures o’er the downs,\r\n And on thy well-breath’d horse keep with thy hounds.\r\n\r\n“And when thou hast on foot the purblind hare,\r\nMark the poor wretch, to overshoot his troubles 680\r\nHow he outruns the wind, and with what care\r\nHe cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles:\r\n The many musits through the which he goes\r\n Are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes. 684\r\n\r\n“Sometime he runs among a flock of sheep,\r\nTo make the cunning hounds mistake their smell,\r\nAnd sometime where earth-delving conies keep,\r\nTo stop the loud pursuers in their yell, 688\r\n And sometime sorteth with a herd of deer;\r\n Danger deviseth shifts, wit waits on fear.\r\n\r\n“For there his smell with others being mingled, 691\r\nThe hot scent-snuffing hounds are driven to doubt,\r\nCeasing their clamorous cry, till they have singled\r\nWith much ado the cold fault cleanly out;\r\n Then do they spend their mouths: echo replies,\r\n As if another chase were in the skies. 696\r\n\r\n“By this, poor Wat, far off upon a hill,\r\nStands on his hinder legs with list’ning ear,\r\nTo hearken if his foes pursue him still.\r\nAnon their loud alarums he doth hear; 700\r\n And now his grief may be compared well\r\n To one sore sick that hears the passing bell.\r\n\r\n“Then shalt thou see the dew-bedabbled wretch\r\nTurn, and return, indenting with the way, 704\r\nEach envious briar his weary legs do scratch,\r\nEach shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay:\r\n For misery is trodden on by many,\r\n And being low never reliev’d by any. 708\r\n\r\n“Lie quietly, and hear a little more;\r\nNay, do not struggle, for thou shalt not rise:\r\nTo make thee hate the hunting of the boar,\r\nUnlike myself thou hear’st me moralize, 712\r\n Applying this to that, and so to so,\r\n For love can comment upon every woe.\r\n\r\n“Where did I leave?” “No matter where,” quoth he\r\n“Leave me, and then the story aptly ends: 716\r\nThe night is spent.” “Why, what of that?” quoth she.\r\n“I am,” quoth he, “expected of my friends;\r\n And now ’tis dark, and going I shall fall.”\r\n “In night,” quoth she, “desire sees best of all.” 720\r\n\r\nBut if thou fall, oh then imagine this,\r\nThe earth, in love with thee, thy footing trips,\r\nAnd all is but to rob thee of a kiss. 723\r\nRich preys make true men thieves; so do thy lips\r\n Make modest Dian cloudy and forlorn,\r\n Lest she should steal a kiss and die forsworn.\r\n\r\n“Now of this dark night I perceive the reason:\r\nCynthia for shame obscures her silver shine 728\r\nTill forging nature be condemn’d of treason,\r\nFor stealing moulds from heaven, that were divine;\r\n Wherein she fram’d thee, in high heaven’s despite,\r\n To shame the sun by day and her by night. 732\r\n\r\n“And therefore hath she brib’d the destinies,\r\nTo cross the curious workmanship of nature,\r\nTo mingle beauty with infirmities,\r\nAnd pure perfection with impure defeature, 736\r\n Making it subject to the tyranny\r\n Of mad mischances and much misery.\r\n\r\n“As burning fevers, agues pale and faint,\r\nLife-poisoning pestilence and frenzies wood, 740\r\nThe marrow-eating sickness, whose attaint\r\nDisorder breeds by heating of the blood;\r\n Surfeits, imposthumes, grief, and damn’d despair,\r\n Swear nature’s death, for framing thee so fair. 744\r\n\r\n“And not the least of all these maladies\r\nBut in one minute’s fight brings beauty under:\r\nBoth favour, savour, hue and qualities,\r\nWhereat th’impartial gazer late did wonder, 748\r\n Are on the sudden wasted, thaw’d and done,\r\n As mountain snow melts with the midday sun.\r\n\r\n“Therefore despite of fruitless chastity,\r\nLove-lacking vestals and self-loving nuns, 752\r\nThat on the earth would breed a scarcity\r\nAnd barren dearth of daughters and of sons,\r\n Be prodigal: the lamp that burns by night\r\n Dries up his oil to lend the world his light. 756\r\n\r\n“What is thy body but a swallowing grave,\r\nSeeming to bury that posterity,\r\nWhich by the rights of time thou needs must have,\r\nIf thou destroy them not in dark obscurity? 760\r\n If so, the world will hold thee in disdain,\r\n Sith in thy pride so fair a hope is slain.\r\n\r\n“So in thyself thyself art made away;\r\nA mischief worse than civil home-bred strife, 764\r\nOr theirs whose desperate hands themselves do slay,\r\nOr butcher sire that reeves his son of life.\r\n Foul cank’ring rust the hidden treasure frets,\r\n But gold that’s put to use more gold begets.” 768\r\n\r\n“Nay then,” quoth Adon, “you will fall again\r\nInto your idle over-handled theme;\r\nThe kiss I gave you is bestow’d in vain,\r\nAnd all in vain you strive against the stream; 772\r\n For by this black-fac’d night, desire’s foul nurse,\r\n Your treatise makes me like you worse and worse.\r\n\r\n“If love have lent you twenty thousand tongues,\r\nAnd every tongue more moving than your own, 776\r\nBewitching like the wanton mermaid’s songs,\r\nYet from mine ear the tempting tune is blown;\r\n For know, my heart stands armed in mine ear,\r\n And will not let a false sound enter there. 780\r\n\r\n“Lest the deceiving harmony should run\r\nInto the quiet closure of my breast,\r\nAnd then my little heart were quite undone,\r\nIn his bedchamber to be barr’d of rest. 784\r\n No, lady, no; my heart longs not to groan,\r\n But soundly sleeps, while now it sleeps alone.\r\n\r\n“What have you urg’d that I cannot reprove?\r\nThe path is smooth that leadeth on to danger; 790\r\nI hate not love, but your device in love\r\nThat lends embracements unto every stranger.\r\n You do it for increase: O strange excuse!\r\n When reason is the bawd to lust’s abuse. 792\r\n\r\n“Call it not, love, for love to heaven is fled,\r\nSince sweating lust on earth usurp’d his name;\r\nUnder whose simple semblance he hath fed\r\nUpon fresh beauty, blotting it with blame; 796\r\n Which the hot tyrant stains and soon bereaves,\r\n As caterpillars do the tender leaves.\r\n\r\n“Love comforteth like sunshine after rain,\r\nBut lust’s effect is tempest after sun; 800\r\nLove’s gentle spring doth always fresh remain,\r\nLust’s winter comes ere summer half be done.\r\n Love surfeits not, lust like a glutton dies;\r\n Love is all truth, lust full of forged lies. 804\r\n\r\n“More I could tell, but more I dare not say;\r\nThe text is old, the orator too green.\r\nTherefore, in sadness, now I will away;\r\nMy face is full of shame, my heart of teen, 808\r\n Mine ears, that to your wanton talk attended\r\n Do burn themselves for having so offended.”\r\n\r\nWith this he breaketh from the sweet embrace 811\r\nOf those fair arms which bound him to her breast,\r\nAnd homeward through the dark laund runs apace;\r\nLeaves love upon her back deeply distress’d.\r\n Look how a bright star shooteth from the sky,\r\n So glides he in the night from Venus’ eye. 816\r\n\r\nWhich after him she darts, as one on shore\r\nGazing upon a late embarked friend,\r\nTill the wild waves will have him seen no more,\r\nWhose ridges with the meeting clouds contend: 820\r\n So did the merciless and pitchy night\r\n Fold in the object that did feed her sight.\r\n\r\nWhereat amaz’d, as one that unaware\r\nHath dropp’d a precious jewel in the flood, 824\r\nOr ’stonish’d as night-wanderers often are,\r\nTheir light blown out in some mistrustful wood;\r\n Even so confounded in the dark she lay,\r\n Having lost the fair discovery of her way. 828\r\n\r\nAnd now she beats her heart, whereat it groans,\r\nThat all the neighbour caves, as seeming troubled,\r\nMake verbal repetition of her moans;\r\nPassion on passion deeply is redoubled: 832\r\n “Ay me!” she cries, and twenty times, “Woe, woe!”\r\n And twenty echoes twenty times cry so.\r\n\r\nShe marking them, begins a wailing note,\r\nAnd sings extemporally a woeful ditty; 836\r\nHow love makes young men thrall, and old men dote,\r\nHow love is wise in folly foolish witty:\r\n Her heavy anthem still concludes in woe,\r\n And still the choir of echoes answer so. 840\r\n\r\nHer song was tedious, and outwore the night,\r\nFor lovers’ hours are long, though seeming short,\r\nIf pleas’d themselves, others they think, delight\r\nIn such like circumstance, with such like sport: 844\r\n Their copious stories oftentimes begun,\r\n End without audience, and are never done.\r\n\r\nFor who hath she to spend the night withal,\r\nBut idle sounds resembling parasites; 848\r\nLike shrill-tongu’d tapsters answering every call,\r\nSoothing the humour of fantastic wits?\r\n She says, “’Tis so:” they answer all, “’Tis so;”\r\n And would say after her, if she said “No.” 852\r\n\r\nLo here the gentle lark, weary of rest,\r\nFrom his moist cabinet mounts up on high,\r\nAnd wakes the morning, from whose silver breast\r\nThe sun ariseth in his majesty; 856\r\n Who doth the world so gloriously behold,\r\n That cedar tops and hills seem burnish’d gold.\r\n\r\nVenus salutes him with this fair good morrow:\r\n“Oh thou clear god, and patron of all light, 860\r\nFrom whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow\r\nThe beauteous influence that makes him bright,\r\n There lives a son that suck’d an earthly mother,\r\n May lend thee light, as thou dost lend to other.”\r\n\r\nThis said, she hasteth to a myrtle grove, 865\r\nMusing the morning is so much o’erworn,\r\nAnd yet she hears no tidings of her love;\r\nShe hearkens for his hounds and for his horn. 868\r\n Anon she hears them chant it lustily,\r\n And all in haste she coasteth to the cry.\r\n\r\nAnd as she runs, the bushes in the way\r\nSome catch her by the neck, some kiss her face, 872\r\nSome twine about her thigh to make her stay:\r\nShe wildly breaketh from their strict embrace,\r\n Like a milch doe, whose swelling dugs do ache,\r\n Hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake. 876\r\n\r\nBy this she hears the hounds are at a bay,\r\nWhereat she starts like one that spies an adder\r\nWreath’d up in fatal folds just in his way,\r\nThe fear whereof doth make him shake and shudder; 880\r\n Even so the timorous yelping of the hounds\r\n Appals her senses, and her spirit confounds.\r\n\r\nFor now she knows it is no gentle chase,\r\nBut the blunt boar, rough bear, or lion proud, 884\r\nBecause the cry remaineth in one place,\r\nWhere fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud,\r\n Finding their enemy to be so curst,\r\n They all strain court’sy who shall cope him first. 888\r\n\r\nThis dismal cry rings sadly in her ear,\r\nThrough which it enters to surprise her heart;\r\nWho overcome by doubt and bloodless fear,\r\nWith cold-pale weakness numbs each feeling part; 892\r\n Like soldiers when their captain once doth yield,\r\n They basely fly and dare not stay the field.\r\n\r\nThus stands she in a trembling ecstasy,\r\nTill cheering up her senses sore dismay’d, 896\r\nShe tells them ’tis a causeless fantasy,\r\nAnd childish error, that they are afraid;\r\n Bids them leave quaking, bids them fear no more:\r\n And with that word, she spied the hunted boar. 900\r\n\r\nWhose frothy mouth bepainted all with red,\r\nLike milk and blood being mingled both together,\r\nA second fear through all her sinews spread,\r\nWhich madly hurries her she knows not whither: 904\r\n This way she runs, and now she will no further,\r\n But back retires, to rate the boar for murther.\r\n\r\nA thousand spleens bear her a thousand ways,\r\nShe treads the path that she untreads again; 908\r\nHer more than haste is mated with delays,\r\nLike the proceedings of a drunken brain,\r\n Full of respects, yet naught at all respecting,\r\n In hand with all things, naught at all effecting.\r\n\r\nHere kennel’d in a brake she finds a hound, 913\r\nAnd asks the weary caitiff for his master,\r\nAnd there another licking of his wound,\r\n’Gainst venom’d sores the only sovereign plaster. 916\r\n And here she meets another sadly scowling,\r\n To whom she speaks, and he replies with howling.\r\n\r\nWhen he hath ceas’d his ill-resounding noise,\r\nAnother flap-mouth’d mourner, black and grim, 920\r\nAgainst the welkin volleys out his voice;\r\nAnother and another answer him,\r\n Clapping their proud tails to the ground below,\r\n Shaking their scratch’d ears, bleeding as they go.\r\n\r\nLook how the world’s poor people are amazed 925\r\nAt apparitions, signs, and prodigies,\r\nWhereon with fearful eyes they long have gazed,\r\nInfusing them with dreadful prophecies; 928\r\n So she at these sad sighs draws up her breath,\r\n And sighing it again, exclaims on death.\r\n\r\n“Hard-favour’d tyrant, ugly, meagre, lean, 931\r\nHateful divorce of love,” thus chides she death,\r\n“Grim-grinning ghost, earth’s worm, what dost thou mean?\r\nTo stifle beauty and to steal his breath,\r\n Who when he liv’d, his breath and beauty set\r\n Gloss on the rose, smell to the violet. 936\r\n\r\n“If he be dead, O no, it cannot be,\r\nSeeing his beauty, thou shouldst strike at it,\r\nO yes, it may, thou hast no eyes to see,\r\nBut hatefully at random dost thou hit. 940\r\n Thy mark is feeble age, but thy false dart\r\n Mistakes that aim, and cleaves an infant’s heart.\r\n\r\n“Hadst thou but bid beware, then he had spoke,\r\nAnd hearing him, thy power had lost his power. 944\r\nThe destinies will curse thee for this stroke;\r\nThey bid thee crop a weed, thou pluck’st a flower.\r\n Love’s golden arrow at him should have fled,\r\n And not death’s ebon dart to strike him dead. 948\r\n\r\n“Dost thou drink tears, that thou provok’st such weeping?\r\nWhat may a heavy groan advantage thee?\r\nWhy hast thou cast into eternal sleeping\r\nThose eyes that taught all other eyes to see? 952\r\n Now nature cares not for thy mortal vigour,\r\n Since her best work is ruin’d with thy rigour.”\r\n\r\nHere overcome, as one full of despair,\r\nShe vail’d her eyelids, who like sluices stopp’d 956\r\nThe crystal tide that from her two cheeks fair\r\nIn the sweet channel of her bosom dropp’d\r\n But through the flood-gates breaks the silver rain,\r\n And with his strong course opens them again. 960\r\n\r\nO how her eyes and tears did lend and borrow;\r\nHer eyes seen in the tears, tears in her eye;\r\nBoth crystals, where they view’d each other’s sorrow,\r\nSorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry; 964\r\n But like a stormy day, now wind, now rain,\r\n Sighs dry her cheeks, tears make them wet again.\r\n\r\nVariable passions throng her constant woe,\r\nAs striving who should best become her grief; 968\r\nAll entertain’d, each passion labours so,\r\nThat every present sorrow seemeth chief,\r\n But none is best, then join they all together,\r\n Like many clouds consulting for foul weather. 972\r\n\r\nBy this, far off she hears some huntsman holla;\r\nA nurse’s song ne’er pleas’d her babe so well:\r\nThe dire imagination she did follow\r\nThis sound of hope doth labour to expel; 976\r\n For now reviving joy bids her rejoice,\r\n And flatters her it is Adonis’ voice.\r\n\r\nWhereat her tears began to turn their tide,\r\nBeing prison’d in her eye, like pearls in glass; 980\r\nYet sometimes falls an orient drop beside,\r\nWhich her cheek melts, as scorning it should pass\r\n To wash the foul face of the sluttish ground,\r\n Who is but drunken when she seemeth drown’d.\r\n\r\nO hard-believing love, how strange it seems 985\r\nNot to believe, and yet too credulous;\r\nThy weal and woe are both of them extremes;\r\nDespair and hope make thee ridiculous, 988\r\n The one doth flatter thee in thoughts unlikely,\r\n In likely thoughts the other kills thee quickly.\r\n\r\nNow she unweaves the web that she hath wrought,\r\nAdonis lives, and death is not to blame; 992\r\nIt was not she that call’d him all to naught;\r\nNow she adds honours to his hateful name.\r\n She clepes him king of graves, and grave for kings,\r\n Imperious supreme of all mortal things. 996\r\n\r\n“No, no,” quoth she, “sweet death, I did but jest;\r\nYet pardon me, I felt a kind of fear\r\nWhenas I met the boar, that bloody beast,\r\nWhich knows no pity, but is still severe; 1000\r\n Then, gentle shadow,—truth I must confess—\r\n I rail’d on thee, fearing my love’s decease.\r\n\r\n“’Tis not my fault, the boar provok’d my tongue;\r\nBe wreak’d on him, invisible commander; 1004\r\n’Tis he, foul creature, that hath done thee wrong;\r\nI did but act, he’s author of my slander.\r\n Grief hath two tongues, and never woman yet,\r\n Could rule them both, without ten women’s wit.”\r\n\r\nThus hoping that Adonis is alive, 1009\r\nHer rash suspect she doth extenuate;\r\nAnd that his beauty may the better thrive,\r\nWith death she humbly doth insinuate; 1012\r\n Tells him of trophies, statues, tombs and stories\r\n His victories, his triumphs and his glories.\r\n\r\n“O love!” quoth she, “how much a fool was I,\r\nTo be of such a weak and silly mind, 1016\r\nTo wail his death who lives, and must not die\r\nTill mutual overthrow of mortal kind;\r\n For he being dead, with him is beauty slain,\r\n And beauty dead, black Chaos comes again. 1020\r\n\r\n“Fie, fie, fond love, thou art as full of fear\r\nAs one with treasure laden, hemm’d with thieves,\r\nTrifles unwitnessed with eye or ear,\r\nThy coward heart with false bethinking grieves.” 1024\r\n Even at this word she hears a merry horn,\r\n Whereat she leaps that was but late forlorn.\r\n\r\nAs falcon to the lure, away she flies;\r\nThe grass stoops not, she treads on it so light, 1028\r\nAnd in her haste unfortunately spies\r\nThe foul boar’s conquest on her fair delight;\r\n Which seen, her eyes, as murder’d with the view,\r\n Like stars asham’d of day, themselves withdrew.\r\n\r\nOr as the snail, whose tender horns being hit, 1033\r\nShrinks backwards in his shelly cave with pain,\r\nAnd there all smother’d up, in shade doth sit,\r\nLong after fearing to creep forth again: 1036\r\n So at his bloody view her eyes are fled\r\n Into the deep dark cabins of her head.\r\n\r\nWhere they resign their office and their light\r\nTo the disposing of her troubled brain, 1040\r\nWho bids them still consort with ugly night,\r\nAnd never wound the heart with looks again;\r\n Who like a king perplexed in his throne,\r\n By their suggestion gives a deadly groan. 1044\r\n\r\nWhereat each tributary subject quakes,\r\nAs when the wind imprison’d in the ground,\r\nStruggling for passage, earth’s foundation shakes,\r\nWhich with cold terror doth men’s minds confound.\r\n This mutiny each part doth so surprise 1049\r\n That from their dark beds once more leap her eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd being open’d, threw unwilling light\r\nUpon the wide wound that the boar had trench’d\r\nIn his soft flank, whose wonted lily white 1053\r\nWith purple tears that his wound wept, was drench’d.\r\n No flower was nigh, no grass, herb, leaf or weed,\r\n But stole his blood and seem’d with him to bleed.\r\n\r\nThis solemn sympathy poor Venus noteth, 1057\r\nOver one shoulder doth she hang her head,\r\nDumbly she passions, franticly she doteth;\r\nShe thinks he could not die, he is not dead: 1060\r\n Her voice is stopp’d, her joints forget to bow,\r\n Her eyes are mad, that they have wept till now.\r\n\r\nUpon his hurt she looks so steadfastly,\r\nThat her sight dazzling makes the wound seem three;\r\nAnd then she reprehends her mangling eye, 1065\r\nThat makes more gashes, where no breach should be:\r\n His face seems twain, each several limb is doubled,\r\n For oft the eye mistakes, the brain being troubled.\r\n\r\n“My tongue cannot express my grief for one, 1069\r\nAnd yet,” quoth she, “behold two Adons dead!\r\nMy sighs are blown away, my salt tears gone,\r\nMine eyes are turn’d to fire, my heart to lead: 1072\r\n Heavy heart’s lead, melt at mine eyes’ red fire!\r\n So shall I die by drops of hot desire.\r\n\r\n“Alas poor world, what treasure hast thou lost!\r\nWhat face remains alive that’s worth the viewing?\r\nWhose tongue is music now? what canst thou boast\r\nOf things long since, or anything ensuing? 1078\r\n The flowers are sweet, their colours fresh and trim,\r\n But true sweet beauty liv’d and died with him.\r\n\r\n“Bonnet nor veil henceforth no creature wear! 1081\r\nNor sun nor wind will ever strive to kiss you:\r\nHaving no fair to lose, you need not fear;\r\nThe sun doth scorn you, and the wind doth hiss you.\r\n But when Adonis liv’d, sun and sharp air 1085\r\n Lurk’d like two thieves, to rob him of his fair.\r\n\r\n“And therefore would he put his bonnet on,\r\nUnder whose brim the gaudy sun would peep; 1088\r\nThe wind would blow it off, and being gone,\r\nPlay with his locks; then would Adonis weep;\r\n And straight, in pity of his tender years,\r\n They both would strive who first should dry his tears.\r\n\r\n“To see his face the lion walk’d along 1093\r\nBehind some hedge, because he would not fear him;\r\nTo recreate himself when he hath sung,\r\nThe tiger would be tame and gently hear him. 1096\r\n If he had spoke, the wolf would leave his prey,\r\n And never fright the silly lamb that day.\r\n\r\n“When he beheld his shadow in the brook,\r\nThe fishes spread on it their golden gills; 1100\r\nWhen he was by, the birds such pleasure took,\r\nThat some would sing, some other in their bills\r\n Would bring him mulberries and ripe-red cherries,\r\n He fed them with his sight, they him with berries.\r\n\r\n“But this foul, grim, and urchin-snouted boar, 1105\r\nWhose downward eye still looketh for a grave,\r\nNe’er saw the beauteous livery that he wore;\r\nWitness the entertainment that he gave. 1108\r\n If he did see his face, why then I know\r\n He thought to kiss him, and hath kill’d him so.\r\n\r\n“’Tis true, ’tis true; thus was Adonis slain:\r\nHe ran upon the boar with his sharp spear, 1112\r\nWho did not whet his teeth at him again,\r\nBut by a kiss thought to persuade him there;\r\n And nuzzling in his flank, the loving swine\r\n Sheath’d unaware the tusk in his soft groin. 1116\r\n\r\n“Had I been tooth’d like him, I must confess,\r\nWith kissing him I should have kill’d him first;\r\nBut he is dead, and never did he bless\r\nMy youth with his; the more am I accurst.” 1120\r\n With this she falleth in the place she stood,\r\n And stains her face with his congealed blood.\r\n\r\nShe looks upon his lips, and they are pale;\r\nShe takes him by the hand, and that is cold, 1124\r\nShe whispers in his ears a heavy tale,\r\nAs if they heard the woeful words she told;\r\nShe lifts the coffer-lids that close his eyes,\r\nWhere lo, two lamps burnt out in darkness lies.\r\n\r\nTwo glasses where herself herself beheld 1129\r\nA thousand times, and now no more reflect;\r\nTheir virtue lost, wherein they late excell’d,\r\nAnd every beauty robb’d of his effect. 1132\r\n “Wonder of time,” quoth she, “this is my spite,\r\n That thou being dead, the day should yet be light.\r\n\r\n“Since thou art dead, lo here I prophesy,\r\nSorrow on love hereafter shall attend: 1136\r\nIt shall be waited on with jealousy,\r\nFind sweet beginning, but unsavoury end;\r\n Ne’er settled equally, but high or low,\r\n That all love’s pleasure shall not match his woe.\r\n\r\n“It shall be fickle, false and full of fraud, 1141\r\nBud, and be blasted in a breathing while;\r\nThe bottom poison, and the top o’erstraw’d\r\nWith sweets that shall the truest sight beguile. 1144\r\n The strongest body shall it make most weak,\r\n Strike the wise dumb, and teach the fool to speak.\r\n\r\n“It shall be sparing, and too full of riot,\r\nTeaching decrepit age to tread the measures; 1148\r\nThe staring ruffian shall it keep in quiet,\r\nPluck down the rich, enrich the poor with treasures;\r\n It shall be raging mad, and silly mild,\r\n Make the young old, the old become a child. 1152\r\n\r\n“It shall suspect where is no cause of fear,\r\nIt shall not fear where it should most mistrust;\r\nIt shall be merciful, and too severe,\r\nAnd most deceiving when it seems most just; 1156\r\n Perverse it shall be, where it shows most toward,\r\n Put fear to valour, courage to the coward.\r\n\r\n“It shall be cause of war and dire events,\r\nAnd set dissension ’twixt the son and sire; 1160\r\nSubject and servile to all discontents,\r\nAs dry combustious matter is to fire,\r\n Sith in his prime death doth my love destroy,\r\n They that love best their love shall not enjoy.” 1164\r\n\r\nBy this the boy that by her side lay kill’d\r\nWas melted like a vapour from her sight,\r\nAnd in his blood that on the ground lay spill’d,\r\nA purple flower sprung up, chequer’d with white, 1168\r\n Resembling well his pale cheeks, and the blood\r\n Which in round drops upon their whiteness stood.\r\n\r\nShe bows her head, the new-sprung flower to smell,\r\nComparing it to her Adonis’ breath; 1172\r\nAnd says within her bosom it shall dwell,\r\nSince he himself is reft from her by death;\r\n She drops the stalk, and in the breach appears\r\n Green-dropping sap, which she compares to tears.\r\n\r\n“Poor flower,” quoth she, “this was thy father’s guise,\r\nSweet issue of a more sweet-smelling sire,\r\nFor every little grief to wet his eyes,\r\nTo grow unto himself was his desire, 1180\r\n And so ’tis thine; but know, it is as good\r\n To wither in my breast as in his blood.\r\n\r\n“Here was thy father’s bed, here in my breast;\r\nThou art the next of blood, and ’tis thy right: 1184\r\nLo in this hollow cradle take thy rest,\r\nMy throbbing heart shall rock thee day and night:\r\n There shall not be one minute in an hour\r\n Wherein I will not kiss my sweet love’s flower.”\r\n\r\nThus weary of the world, away she hies, 1189\r\nAnd yokes her silver doves; by whose swift aid\r\nTheir mistress mounted through the empty skies,\r\nIn her light chariot quickly is convey’d; 1192\r\n Holding their course to Paphos, where their queen\r\n Means to immure herself and not be seen.\r\n\n FINIS"
