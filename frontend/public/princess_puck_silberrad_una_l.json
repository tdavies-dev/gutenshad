      "content": "MISS BROWNLOW’S NIECES.\r\n\nIt was in March that Bill Alardy went to Ashelton. She was sent there\r\n“to grow up,” Polly said, and added some sceptical remarks with regard\r\nto both place and person. “Poor little Wilhelmina,” said Miss Brownlow,\r\n“she has never had a fair chance among us all; the best possible thing\r\nfor her would be to go to Ashelton with Theresa.” And Miss Brownlow\r\nshould have known, for she was acquainted with Ashelton, and even\r\nbetter acquainted with Bill, having had the doubtful pleasure of her\r\ncharge and company from early childhood. Polly did not know much about\r\nAshelton; she had only been there once to spend the day with Theresa,\r\nwhich was a grievance in itself, for Theresa had lived there ever since\r\nher marriage last June. That, however, was beside the point; Polly did\r\nnot so much base her doubts of the efficacy of the plan on Ashelton as\r\non Bill, and she had known her as long as Miss Brownlow, for she was\r\nthe eldest, as Bill was the youngest, of the four nieces Miss Brownlow\r\nhad taken into her household. Polly’s opinion and Miss Brownlow’s were\r\nnot identical on the subject of Bill; but when the matter of the going\r\nto Ashelton was being discussed Polly did not consider it necessary to\r\ngive undue prominence to the difference, thinking Bill might as well go\r\neven if it did her no good.\r\n\r\nIt was a Monday evening when the plan was first mentioned, and Miss\r\nBrownlow was making up her accounts at the time. She always made up\r\nher accounts on Monday evenings. In her opinion there was no other\r\ntime half so satisfactory, because, as she said, there was Sunday just\r\nbefore, and it was so easy to remember forgotten things on a Sunday.\r\nPerhaps it was not right to think of such things then, and of course\r\nshe never did so on purpose, only one cannot help things flashing\r\nacross one’s mind. Occasionally the things flashed away again before\r\nshe had time to secure them on Monday evening; occasionally also, the\r\nflashes were delusive and baseless; but on the other hand, sometimes\r\nthey did chance to be correct, and then it was most satisfactory. This\r\ndid not make any material difference to Miss Brownlow’s accounts, which\r\nnever by any chance came right; they never had come right since she\r\nfirst began keeping them in her girlhood, more years ago than she ever\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n“My father always insisted on our keeping an account of our money, and\r\nhow we spent it,” she used to say to her nieces. “It is an excellent\r\nplan, my dears, for then you know where you are and how you stand.”\r\nThese desirable results did not always occur in her own case, though\r\nthat did not deter her nieces from following the suggestion, each\r\naccording to her nature,--Theresa with neatness and some success,\r\nBella with results not unlike her aunt’s, Polly--there were commercial\r\ninstincts in Polly’s blood and her untidy books were kept with an\r\naccuracy which might have savoured of sharp practice to any one who\r\ncould comprehend them. Bill, of course, was too young to be considered,\r\nand too penniless to keep a record of her non-existent income;\r\nmoreover, she was only “Poor little Bill--Wilhelmina”--Miss Brownlow\r\ninvariably made the correction in mind and sometimes in speech. She\r\nsighed as she thought about the girl,--she had just come to the item\r\n_one shilling, a bottle of Stephens’s blue-black writing-ink_. Bill had\r\non Thursday upset the last bottle on the schoolroom-floor, in class,\r\ntoo, with all the little girls looking on. How they giggled! Polly said\r\nafterwards that Bill made them, but Miss Brownlow did not think so.\r\nBill was too old to do anything so wrong; she was seventeen now, though\r\nshe seemed such a child. Polly, who was perhaps not without authority\r\non the subject, was of opinion that age had little to do with iniquity,\r\nbut Miss Brownlow was not convinced. In any case she had to pay the\r\nshilling for another bottle of ink. The column of figures she was now\r\ncounting up did not come to the total she expected: “Now what have I\r\nforgotten?” she said.\r\n\r\nBella and Theresa glanced up but did not hazard a suggestion; they\r\nknew the remark was not addressed to them, and they went on correcting\r\nFrench exercises in silence. These French exercises were really Bella’s\r\nwork, but Theresa was helping her with them to-night. A year ago they\r\nwere Theresa’s own, but when she married her sister had taken up that\r\npart of her work. Theresa was on a visit to Miss Brownlow, and finding\r\nherself back among the familiar surroundings it came quite natural to\r\nher to take up some part of the old duties; besides, she liked to help\r\nBella.\r\n\r\nAs the two tall sisters sat close together, sharing the same dictionary\r\nand sometimes bending over the same page, Miss Brownlow thought they\r\nmade a beautiful picture; possibly even a less prejudiced observer\r\nmight not have entirely disagreed. Polly was certainly not a prejudiced\r\nobserver, yet even she admitted the sisters’ beauty in a general way.\r\nShe did not look in their direction now, for she was busy with her\r\nneedlework. She sat opposite to Miss Brownlow, close to the lamp, her\r\ndressmaking scattered around her. She possessed a perfect genius for\r\nwhat is technically known as “doing up” her clothes; consequently some\r\nof them were always undergoing alterations and repairs, and none of\r\nthem kept the same appearance for long together.\r\n\r\n“I cannot account for sixpence,” Miss Brownlow said at last; “on what\r\ncan I have spent sixpence?”\r\n\r\n“Cabbages,” Polly said briefly.\r\n\r\n“Cabbages! My dear Polly, one cannot buy cabbages at this time of year,\r\nnor hardly anything else either; vegetables are so dear and scarce, it\r\nis really quite dreadful.”\r\n\r\n“Sweep,” was Polly’s only comment.\r\n\r\nBut it was not the sweep, Miss Brownlow said. “We have not had him this\r\nfortnight past,” she declared. “Don’t you remember, the last--”\r\n\r\n“Then we ought to have had.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I am sure we do not need him yet, don’t you remember the last time\r\nhe came--”\r\n\r\nPolly did not remember, and she showed no interest in the reminiscence;\r\nbut Theresa, who did not like to hear Miss Brownlow treated so\r\ncavalierly, encouraged her aunt to describe the last coming of the\r\nsweep and the delinquencies of the maid-servant who overslept herself\r\non that occasion. “And I really do believe he would never have got in\r\nat all if it had not been for Bill; she heard him ringing and went down\r\nand let him in,--in her nightdress too!”\r\n\r\n“That sixpence is for mending Bill’s boots.” This was Polly’s remark.\r\n\r\n“What a memory you have!” Miss Brownlow exclaimed, and Polly showed\r\nsigns of remembering the incident of the sweep. “Bill did go down to\r\nhim,” she said, “in her nightdress and _nothing else_. I should like to\r\nknow how long she stopped down with him!”\r\n\r\nPolly had a habit of talking in italics; her treatment of the English\r\nlanguage made it acquire an almost double value, her intonation giving\r\nthe words an additional worth and meaning. Her last speech was an\r\nadmirable example of her methods; there were many more things implied\r\nin it than were said. It was the implications which made Bella exclaim,\r\n“You are hard on the child.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, well!” And Polly shrugged her shoulders and bent over her work\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n“Poor little Bill, poor little Wilhelmina!” Miss Brownlow sighed softly.\r\n\r\nPolly sniffed and Theresa asked: “How much longer are you going to let\r\nher be in the school?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, a long time,” Miss Brownlow answered readily; she had not begun\r\nto contemplate the problem of Bill’s future, nor even to admit its\r\nexistence. Polly knew that and her small dark eyes showed that she knew\r\nit as she remarked: “I began to teach the little ones before I was\r\nseventeen.”\r\n\r\nMiss Brownlow looked distressed, but Bella said cheerfully: “That was\r\nlong ago; Auntie wanted help then. Now it is quite different; if Bill\r\nwere ever so able to teach there would not be the slightest need for\r\nher to do it; in fact I don’t see whom she would teach.”\r\n\r\nThis speech, though perhaps hardly likely to fulfil its comforting\r\nintention, was unfortunately only too true. It was indisputable that\r\nMiss Brownlow’s school was not what it had been, that its best days\r\nlay behind it. At one time it had been almost an Establishment, the\r\nrecognised school of Wrugglesby, the place to which the country\r\nclergymen and gentlemen-farmers of the surrounding districts sent their\r\ndaughters. The boarders were so many then that it had been necessary\r\nto have a _mademoiselle_ and a visiting English governess. That was\r\nsome time ago, but even when Theresa first began to help with the\r\nteaching, things were more prosperous than they were now. Gradually\r\nthey had changed; times had changed, boarders had fallen off one by\r\none, new ones did not come; girls went further now,--to Brighton, to\r\nBournemouth, even to France and Germany. Mademoiselle left, and it\r\nhardly seemed necessary to fill her place, for Theresa was a very good\r\nFrench scholar. The English governess married, and Bella was found\r\nequal to doing all that was left of her work. Then, rather more than a\r\nyear ago, Theresa married, and though Miss Brownlow talked of finding\r\nsome nice well-educated girl to fill her place, nothing came of it.\r\nTheresa used to take the elder girls, and they were so few now that\r\nBella could quite well help Miss Brownlow with them, especially as she\r\nwas rather clever; she had passed the Cambridge Local Examination and\r\nattended some history lectures. Polly, of course, still taught the\r\nlittle ones; she always had done so, and had always contrived to drill\r\na certain amount of information into them. It is to be feared that\r\nshe did not know very much herself; even Miss Brownlow was obliged to\r\nadmit that; yet she possessed a far greater faculty for teaching than\r\ndid the more accomplished Bella. As the school was chiefly composed\r\nof little girls, it really was important that they should be well\r\ntaught. Sometimes Miss Brownlow felt a passing regret when she saw them\r\nstruggling for their overshoes in the lobby; they were not what her old\r\npupils had been, not of the same social position, not of the same age;\r\nmost of them were “reductions” on account of sisters past, present, or\r\nto come; none of them were likely to remain any length of time, none of\r\nthem were even weekly boarders. There were only two boarders besides\r\nWilhelmina, who could hardly be counted since she belonged to the\r\nhousehold.\r\n\r\nMiss Wilson, the principal of the High School two stations up the line,\r\nthought of Miss Brownlow when, in her able paper on the education of\r\ngirls, she had written of teachers of the past. Miss Brownlow was\r\nof the past, not highly educated, not clever, but kindly, simple,\r\npleasant, well loved by those pupils of long ago, a gentle power for\r\ngood in those past best days,--and in the present? Ah, well, the school\r\nwas going; there were no boarders to be influenced one way or the\r\nother now, and the little girls who came daily did not trouble about\r\nMiss Brownlow. She was of a race of schoolmistresses fast disappearing\r\nfrom the earth, vanishing under the inexorable law of the survival of\r\nthe fittest. She was not the fittest. Inefficient? Yes, that was it;\r\ninefficient for modern needs, modern wants; growing old, just a little\r\npast the work she once did, not at all fit for the work now to be\r\ndone; never a very wise woman, thank God, not wise enough to know that\r\nshe was a failure.\r\n\r\n“Wilhelmina will teach somewhere else,” Miss Brownlow said, after she\r\nhad mentally reviewed the prospect called up by Bella’s words; and\r\nmercifully the prospect she reviewed was not quite that which other\r\npeople saw.\r\n\r\n“Where?” Polly asked casually, as if the matter were of small moment.\r\n\r\nMiss Brownlow did not know. She had not thought, and the question was\r\nembarrassing.\r\n\r\nBella came to the rescue. “Mrs. Caxton will want a governess if her\r\nlittle girls are leaving at Easter. They are leaving because they\r\nalways catch colds from the other children, so she is sure to want a\r\ngoverness.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, of course,” Miss Brownlow said enthusiastically; “it would be the\r\nvery thing for Bill; she never has a cold.”\r\n\r\n“H’m! What is she to teach? How not to catch cold? It is about the only\r\nthing she knows, and she does that by accident.”\r\n\r\n“They are so young,” Miss Brownlow went on, delighted with the plan and\r\nregardless of Polly’s interruption; “they will only want elementary\r\nteaching, reading and writing and spelling.”\r\n\r\n“Bill can’t spell, not that that matters so very much though”--Polly\r\nperhaps knew by experience that it was possible to teach a subject in\r\nwhich you were not very deeply learned. “It certainly would not matter\r\nto Bill, nothing would matter. If she could spell every word in the\r\ndictionary, do you suppose any one would have her for a governess?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know why not,--when she is a little older of course. She is\r\nsuch a child yet; wait till she is grown up.”\r\n\r\n“We have been waiting,” Polly observed grimly.\r\n\r\n“She is very young for her age; I am sure I don’t know how it is.”\r\n\r\n“She was born without gumption,” said Polly with conviction, “and she\r\nhas never been able to acquire any general knowledge.”\r\n\r\n“She is not clever,” Miss Brownlow admitted sadly.\r\n\r\n“Cleverness has nothing to do with it,” Polly retorted. “If you\r\nstart in life lacking what Bill lacks, you must do what you can with\r\ncommon-sense. That will teach you a few things,--what not to say, and\r\nhow to say it, and--and all that. Bill has no common-sense.”\r\n\r\n“We have always treated her like a child;” and here Miss Brownlow\r\nsighed again.\r\n\r\nIt was then that Theresa suggested that Bill should come home with her\r\nto stay at Ashelton for a little while. Miss Brownlow was delighted\r\nwith the suggestion; it was just the thing, she was sure. No doubt the\r\ngirl would develop; Theresa would use her influence, and her young\r\ncousin had always been so fond of her, had always respected and admired\r\nher so much; such a visit would be the best possible thing. Theresa\r\nherself did not anticipate very great results, but she promised to do\r\nher best, and after some discussion of details regarding the proposed\r\nvisit, Miss Brownlow returned to her accounts and the sisters to the\r\nexercises, interrupted only now and again by a repetition of the elder\r\nlady’s satisfaction with the plan. After the third interruption Polly\r\nyawned aggressively. When there was silence again she bit her cotton\r\nand looked thoughtfully across at Miss Brownlow, at the kindly face,\r\nthe thin hair, the black stuff gown she knew so well. She did not\r\napprove of the whole effect; she thought it “snuffy,” and as such\r\nunlikely to create a favourable impression on the parents of possible\r\nscholars. She looked beyond Miss Brownlow to the wall behind,--to the\r\npale-toned paper with faint gold lines and fainter grey flowers, to the\r\nold-fashioned water-colours in shabby gilt frames, the white marble\r\nmantelpiece with red glass candlesticks upon it, and to the rosewood\r\nchairs covered with green rep, standing one on either side of the\r\nfireplace. The room was no more attractive than Miss Brownlow’s dress,\r\nshe thought; it was terribly old-fashioned in comparison with Miss\r\nWilson’s flatted walls and artistic green cushions. Polly had a poor\r\nopinion of art-colours, but she seriously considered the advisability\r\nof draping some of the household gods with the best of the shades of\r\nyellow. She was, in her own mind, reckoning the quantity of material\r\nnecessary, when Miss Brownlow again broke in on her reflections.\r\n\r\n“Are you sure Robert won’t mind?” she asked for the fourth time.\r\n\r\n“Quite sure,” was Theresa’s answer.\r\n\r\n“That’s all right; I should not like to put him about at all. You are\r\nquite certain?”\r\n\r\nTheresa was quite certain, and the subject was dismissed. Polly\r\nbreathed a heavy sigh, and once more fell back on her own thoughts.\r\nThese now turned from the art-materials to Robert Morton, Theresa’s\r\nhusband. Polly had not a very high opinion of Robert Morton; she liked\r\nhim well enough, but considered him a bad speculation. “He’ll die of\r\napoplexy--poor Theresa--I’m sorry for that poor girl. He’ll certainly\r\ndie of it, and I expect he’ll die young.” So she had once said to the\r\nindignant Bella, and she thought of the verdict again this evening as\r\nshe glanced at the sisters and mentally dressed Theresa in widow’s\r\nweeds. She would make a handsome widow, though perhaps not so effective\r\nas Bella. Polly glanced meditatively at Bella; a widow’s cap would\r\nlook well on that golden head. Theresa was darker and older too by\r\nnearly four years; she would be twenty-six in the summer and she looked\r\nher age; in fact, Theresa was almost too dignified. Bella was not\r\ndignified, though she was tall. They were both tall and graceful and\r\nclear-skinned; both had blue eyes, Theresa’s grave and sweet, Bella’s\r\nholy, innocent, suggesting a madonna’s eyes to the observer until he\r\nbecame aware of the turned-up nose between; “a flirt’s nose,” Polly\r\ncalled it. Theresa’s features were better, though less attractive; she\r\nhad not a flirt’s nose, but also she had no tantalising dimple in her\r\nchin. Still they were both undeniably beauties, and Polly was nothing\r\nof the sort."

      "content": "BILL.\r\n\nTheresa and Bella Waring were beauties when they came to Miss\r\nBrownlow’s seven years ago, well-educated, well-informed, used to the\r\nways of society (of small professional society), and possessed of sixty\r\npounds a year between them. Their father had been dead some years then;\r\nit was their mother’s death which sent them and their sixty pounds to\r\nLangford House. Theresa came to help with the teaching, Bella to finish\r\nher education first, and afterwards to fill her sister’s place. Of\r\ncourse Miss Brownlow received them gladly, loved them warmly, mothered\r\nthem to the best of her ability. She would have done that for any\r\nnumber of nieces, and she did it heartily for these four. Polly felt\r\nangry as she thought of their numbers, and thought contemptuously of\r\nthe Brownlow family and its faculty for dying. There had been five Miss\r\nBrownlows originally; one died young, three married first and then\r\ndied at their earliest convenience, leaving their children as a legacy\r\nto the remaining sister who neither married nor died. She, possessed\r\nof short views, a large heart, and an inexhaustible supply of hope,\r\nwelcomed them with open arms. Two of them she had to adopt entirely;\r\nthe other two, Theresa and Bella, came to her better endowed, better\r\nequipped, and at a more convenient age.\r\n\r\nAnd what had they done with their advantages? Polly put the case to\r\nherself with contemptuous irritation. Bella, so she summed it up, Bella\r\nat twenty-two had done nothing; Theresa at twenty-six had contrived to\r\nmarry a small farmer. No doubt his family had originally been good,\r\nbut one cannot live on a good family, especially if it is all but\r\nextinct; and the goodness did not prevent Robert from being a farmer\r\nin a small way, and an unsuccessful one too. He was undoubtedly a poor\r\nspeculation; his tastes were expensive, his inclinations horsey, his\r\nincome small, his tendencies apoplectic; he would soon, no doubt, die,\r\nand die suddenly, leaving Theresa no better off than she was a year\r\nago. Really these two girls were stupid, as stupid as the Brownlow\r\nfamily. And yet their mother had been the best of the five sisters,\r\naccording to all accounts; the strongest as well as the prettiest,\r\nfor she had managed to live to quite a respectable age. Possibly her\r\ndaughters were like her; they were sensible enough for any ordinary\r\noccasion but they were not, in Polly’s opinion, able to take advantage\r\nof adverse circumstances. “They would die off easily,” she thought,\r\n“and they haven’t an idea between them worth mentioning.”\r\n\r\nPolly was not like the Brownlow family. She took after her father,\r\na dubious advantage, and she flattered herself that she had ideas\r\nworth,--well, something, although perhaps they were not always quite\r\nsuitable for public mention. She also had an easy conscience, and\r\nin her youth some little acquaintance with social byways. She had a\r\ntenacious hold on life, and was not likely to follow her mother’s and\r\naunts’ example and die easily. “So has Bill,” she thought; “she is\r\nsilly and she is ugly, but she won’t fade out of the world in a hurry,\r\nthough I can’t see what good she will ever be in it.”\r\n\r\nThis last sentiment found something like an echo, albeit unexpressed,\r\nin the minds of two other inmates of Langford House, the two boarders\r\nCarrie and Alice. They were quiet, inoffensive girls, a year or two\r\nyounger than Bill, and forced by circumstances to have more of her\r\ncompany than they desired. The greater part of the day the three were\r\ntogether, and for the night they shared one room so that the sisters’\r\nnocturnal confidences had to be held in common with their companion.\r\nIt must be admitted that Carrie and Alice did not altogether like\r\nBill, though they felt a sort of superior pity for her which was not\r\nall unpleasant. On the evening when Miss Brownlow and her nieces were\r\nplanning Bill’s future good, Carrie and Alice were giving her a little\r\nadvice while going to bed. It was on the subject of hairdressing,\r\nCarrie thinking it was time Bill coiled her hair on the top of her head.\r\n\r\n“It’s quite time,” she concluded. “Are you going to wait till you are\r\neighteen? When are you going to do it up?”\r\n\r\nBill considered: “To-morrow,” she said at last.\r\n\r\n“To-morrow?” Carrie repeated, and Alice added: “You can’t, you haven’t\r\ngot any hairpins.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll get some of Bella’s.”\r\n\r\n“You can’t,” Carrie said again, and turning to the glass began to\r\narrange her own hair.\r\n\r\n“Miss Waring has gold-coloured hairpins,” Alice remarked; “you could\r\nnot use them.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Because it would look horrid to have brass hairpins sticking out of\r\nyour hair.”\r\n\r\n“Is that all?” Bill did not seem impressed.\r\n\r\nCarrie turned away from the glass. “That is how I shall do my hair,”\r\nshe said. “I shall do it up the day I leave school, the very day.”\r\n\r\n“I like plaits better,” Alice observed; but Bill examined the\r\nhead-dress thoughtfully, and then asked: “And what else will you do\r\nwhen you leave school,--besides your hair, I mean?”\r\n\r\n“Besides my hair? How ridiculous you are!” Carrie did not seem\r\ndispleased by the question. She condescended to answer it rather fully,\r\nand as she took off her shoes and stockings talked of the possibilities\r\nof evening parties, the certainty of afternoon calls, the charms of\r\nlong dresses, and of the young men who stayed at the Rectory. Alice\r\njoined in this explanation, and in fact the sisters were soon talking\r\nto and for each other only, having almost forgotten Bill’s presence\r\nuntil she exclaimed suddenly: “Men! It’s all men! Why are they nicer\r\nthan women?”\r\n\r\nShe was sitting on her pillow in her favourite position, her knees\r\ndrawn up, her elbows resting upon them, and her chin framed in her\r\nhands; she was looking straight in front of her and only turned her\r\neyes on the sisters when she spoke. They objected to her method of\r\nlooking round without turning her head; that, in addition to the\r\nimpropriety of the remark, made Carrie answer severely: “Men are not\r\nnicer than women; nobody thinks so except those who are fast.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, they are nicer. You think so, Polly thinks so, Bella thinks so,\r\nevery girl thinks so, though I don’t see why.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t know any men”; this was said with great contempt.\r\n\r\n“No, nor any girls either, except you two, and you are nice!” Bill had\r\nan enormous mouth and the beginning of a smile curved it as she spoke.\r\n\r\n“Then it is more than you are,” Alice retorted with irritation, “or you\r\nwould not talk about men like that.”\r\n\r\n“Men aren’t half so amusing as women,” Bill went on, ignoring the last\r\nspeech; “and women aren’t half so amusing when men are there. I can’t\r\nsee where the attraction comes in with any of them--the rector, the\r\ncurates, the masters at the grammar-school, Robert Morton, any of them.”\r\n\r\n“Of course they don’t take any notice of you,” Carrie said, and Alice\r\nadded: “You only think about people being amusing; you like people whom\r\nyou can imitate.”\r\n\r\n“That’s why I like you,” Bill said sweetly. “Why do you like\r\npeople--men?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t like men; you have never heard me speak of them!”\r\n\r\n“Heard!” Bill laughed. “I have felt; I have felt you crinkle up for a\r\nboy!”\r\n\r\n“You haven’t! How dare you say such things!”\r\n\r\n“Why not? Where is the harm? You talk about men to each other, why not\r\nto me? You never have before, but I see no reason why you should not.\r\nDo you consider it wrong to like men? How queer it is; you all like men\r\nand you all pretend you do not. There is a deal of humbug about it.”\r\n\r\n“Some people,” Carrie said with severity, “have a sense of decency.”\r\n\r\n“A sense of decency? That’s what Adam and Eve had when they hid\r\nthemselves; a sense of decency often seems to mean hiding something.”\r\n\r\n“You are very wicked!” Alice said scandalised, and would have nothing\r\nmore to say to Bill for some time, though after the light was out and\r\nall three were in bed the sisters continued to talk to each other about\r\nthe wonderful future, the first ball Carrie would attend, and the\r\nevents that would follow.\r\n\r\n“And after that,” came the voice from Bill’s bed,--“what are you going\r\nto do after that?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t know,” Carrie answered; “marry I suppose. There is a use\r\nfor your despised men; you can’t marry without them.”\r\n\r\n“Marry--h’m!--Yes, I expect you will marry.”\r\n\r\n“Do you really think so? I don’t know--and yet,--yes, I suppose I\r\nshould rather like to; not yet of course, but by and by, to marry and\r\nto have several children.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you are sure to; you are like the old white hen with feathers down\r\nher legs; you would make a splendid sitter.”\r\n\r\n“Bill!”\r\n\r\n“Now what’s the matter? Is it the sense of decency again?”\r\n\r\nBut the sisters would not answer her question and, having told her so,\r\nwent on to say that, as it was forbidden to talk after the light was\r\nout, they were not going to do it any more, especially to her. Then\r\nthey went to sleep, leaving Bill to her own reflections. She, thus\r\nleft, rolled over on her back and lay staring up into the darkness\r\nabove her and thinking. At her age one does not always think with a\r\ndefinite coherent clearness; dreaming is more to the mind of seventeen.\r\nBill dreamed, fancies and thoughts flitting to and fro in her mind.\r\n\r\nAbout marriage, for instance; last year Theresa had tried the great\r\nexperiment to which Carrie looked forward. Carrie would try it by and\r\nby; she would become Mrs. Somebody and grow staid and stout and placid;\r\nshe would talk about “my house” and “my husband”; she would bound the\r\nuniverse, almost the Kingdom of Heaven by those two; she would wear a\r\nblack silk dress and a heavy gold chain like Mrs. Bodling; she would\r\nget fatter and fairer and calmer; she would entirely lose sight of her\r\nfeet----\r\n\r\nBill stretched out her own feet, and then lay still to listen. The wind\r\ncrept in at the open window and stirred the curtains; the cloth on the\r\ntoilet-table flapped idly, reminding her of quiet, slumberous summer\r\nafternoons, of a certain Thursday afternoon in June especially,--it\r\nwas in June that Theresa had entered on the great experiment. In\r\nthe first freshness of early summer she left the school and the old\r\nroutine-work and the narrow, cosy, feminine life and went out to try\r\na wider, fuller, new life. She was to have a house of her own and a\r\nservant; there had been a lot of talk about the house (here Bill built\r\nan ideal house for herself), a lot of things to be bought, a lot of\r\nnew clothes for Theresa. Miss Brownlow and the girls had pinched and\r\nscraped and worked; Bill had been allowed to help a little, though her\r\nwork was more strong than neat. Evening after evening Bella and Polly\r\nand Theresa had sat at work with Miss Brownlow--how they seemed to\r\nenjoy it! Theresa must have missed that when she went to her new home;\r\nBill wondered what she did during those first evenings of the new life.\r\nThen the great day had come; Bill recalled every detail of it. There\r\nhad been excitement and bustle and people and flowers, Theresa in her\r\nbridal gown, and everywhere the scent of the little white roses--the\r\nwhite roses which made Bill think of funerals, though she did not know\r\nwhy.\r\n\r\nThen Theresa had gone away. She kissed them all and cried, and smiled\r\nand cried again, and went. Robert Morton looked rather cross during the\r\nkissing and crying, but nobody seemed to mind. They were quite sure\r\nTheresa was happy, quite sure she had attained to all that she desired;\r\nonly Bill thought she must be very lonely. She had also an inward\r\nconviction, founded on nothing, that Theresa would be desperately\r\ndisappointed in her venture. There was no reason for these thoughts,\r\nand Theresa had said nothing to suggest them; she seemed happy, and\r\nthey all thought her so except Bill, and Bill was so childish that she\r\ncould not be expected to know anything about the matter. She had only\r\nonce been to Theresa’s home at Ashelton. They had all driven there one\r\nSeptember day and enjoyed it greatly. Bill could recall every detail of\r\nthe expedition, her memory was vivid and her experiences few. She had\r\nnever been again to Ashelton; she had never been on a visit--\r\n\r\nShe was growing very sleepy now, and her thoughts became confused with\r\nthe words of the cousins who were speaking just outside the door.\r\n\r\n“I shall be very glad to have her.”\r\n\r\n“You will be more glad to be rid of her; besides, she has no clothes.”\r\n\r\nAt the Day of Judgment Polly would still be considering her\r\nclothes--she would probably want to let out her garment of\r\nrighteousness if--but sleep mastered Bill here."

      "content": "ROBERT MORTON.\r\n\nIt was September,--rich September, with warm lights and red\r\nshadows--when Bill went first to Haylands, Robert Morton’s farm. It\r\nwas March when she went again; a grey afternoon, level light, and\r\ndead stillness over the bare ploughed land and the low white house.\r\nShe drove from Wrugglesby with Theresa, a tedious drive along winding\r\nlanes,--not that she found it tedious, for nothing was tedious to Bill.\r\nTheresa, too, had enjoyed her homeward journey more than usual. She\r\nhad talked gaily all the way until they turned in at her own gateway;\r\nthen somehow her spirits flagged, and in silence they drove up the\r\nlong chase which meandered across a grassy field, passed a duck-pond\r\nwhere grey geese waded, and so on to the little gate which shut in\r\nthe overgrown garden. Bill looked quickly at the garden. It had been\r\na flowery, weedy wilderness when she was there in September; it was\r\nbare now, so dry that the earth rose in dust at the touch of Theresa’s\r\nskirts, so bare that the leafless raspberry-canes, still though they\r\nwere, seemed to shiver in their nakedness.\r\n\r\nThere was no one about; Robert, no doubt, was busy somewhere on the\r\nfarm. For a moment Theresa hesitated with the reins in her hand, then a\r\nman appeared from the stables and took the pony away. Theresa led the\r\nway into the house, covertly casting an anxious glance at Bill.\r\n\r\n“It is very cold,” she said, as she pushed open the door of her\r\nfavourite room and went to the fire.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I suppose it is,” Bill answered cheerfully. “I’m not cold though.\r\nWhat a jolly room! It is cubby, T.!”\r\n\r\n“Do you like it? You saw it when you were here before,” Theresa said,\r\nfeeling somehow a little warmer and very glad that Bill was with\r\nher. If it had been Polly or Bella they might have thought Robert\r\nneglectful, but as it was only Bill it did not matter.\r\n\r\nBy-and-bye Robert came in. He did not know that Bill was coming back\r\nwith his wife, and when the guest was safely shut in her room he asked,\r\n“Why on earth did you bring her?”\r\n\r\n“Do you mind?” Theresa asked in distress. “I am sorry; I did not think\r\nyou would mind; she won’t trouble you much.”\r\n\r\n“No, she won’t trouble me; still I don’t see what you wanted to have\r\nher for.”\r\n\r\n“We thought--I thought, it might do her good.”\r\n\r\n“Ill?” Morton asked, looking up sharply. “If she is ill, we certainly\r\ndon’t want her here.”\r\n\r\n“She is not ill. She does not get on very well at school; I mean--”\r\nTheresa felt the matter was difficult of explanation--“I mean, she is\r\nvery young for her age.”\r\n\r\n“She is very ugly,” Morton said, beginning to unlace his boots.\r\n\r\nTheresa flushed. “She is my cousin,” she said.\r\n\r\n“That don’t make her handsome, my dear,” he observed, without looking\r\nup.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think her at all ugly.” Theresa’s voice showed that she was\r\nhurt. “If she were, it would not be her fault. Do you wish me to send\r\nher home at the end of the week?”\r\n\r\n“I? No, please yourself as to that. Keep her as long as you like, as\r\nfar as I am concerned.”\r\n\r\nAnd he left her to take his boots to the wash-house with no idea that\r\nthere were tears in her eyes. She forced them back, turning to the\r\nfire as she did so. It was certainly cold, a dreary, dreary afternoon.\r\nShe was still standing by the fire, standing stiffly with something of\r\nunapproachable dignity about her, when Bill came down a few minutes\r\nlater; but Bill was not troubled by the dignity, and curled herself\r\nup in the big chair on the other side of the fire evidently quite\r\nsatisfied. She spent the evening helping Robert to mend whips, quite\r\nsatisfied with that too; possibly she found it an improvement on\r\nlearning grammar with Carrie and Alice.\r\n\r\nTheresa was relieved to find that Bill and Robert showed so much\r\ninclination to friendliness; indeed, at the end of two days she came\r\nto the conclusion that they were better friends than ever Robert and\r\nBella had been. It was a very good thing, she thought, as she watched\r\nBill wandering about the cow-yard and investigating the pig-styes. Bill\r\ntook the keenest interest in pigs and poultry, cows and butter; her\r\ninterest extended to the dairy, the kitchen, and the store-room; she\r\nseemed anxious to do any work she could. Theresa gave her dusting and\r\nchurning, and she worked with a will, though when the churning was done\r\nTheresa was rather horrified to find her young cousin scrubbing the\r\ndairy-floor.\r\n\r\n“Bill! What are you doing?”\r\n\r\n“Clearing up,--I upset some butter-milk.” Bill was kneeling on the\r\nbricks and she did not cease scrubbing to give the answer.\r\n\r\n“But, my dear child, there is no necessity,--get up.”\r\n\r\n“I like it, I like clearing up. I did the old fowls’ house just before\r\nI came in here; you should see it; it’s beautifully clean. This\r\nafternoon I am going to lime-wash it, and then I shall put in the\r\nbiggest family of chickens. They have not half enough room where they\r\nare; Robert said I might move them if I liked.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but,--surely you need not lime-wash the house yourself; one of\r\nthe men can do it. You must not do it; you will make yourself in such a\r\nstate.”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid I am rather a dirty worker.”\r\n\r\nTheresa glanced at Bill’s present condition and saw that the statement\r\nwas only too true. “You must leave off,” she said: “the soapsuds are\r\nall up your sleeves; besides, I want to speak to you.”\r\n\r\n“All right, I can hear; you sit down on that wooden tub; I’m just done,\r\nand I can finish while you are talking.”\r\n\r\nTheresa sat down in spite of her protestations. “I want to talk to\r\nyou about the prayer-meeting,” she said. “You know, during Lent Mr.\r\nJohnson holds meetings once a week, a kind of Bible-reading. We meet at\r\ndifferent houses and read passages from the Bible, and he explains them\r\nand gives a little address. They are really rather nice, and not too\r\nlong. We meet at seven and it is all over quite early; we usually have\r\nsupper about half-past eight.”\r\n\r\n“Yes?” Bill was working industriously at the last corner.\r\n\r\n“I meant--do you think you would care to go?” Theresa asked this\r\nsomewhat doubtfully. Bella and Polly had been amused by the idea of\r\nthe Ashelton prayer-meetings, and Bill, according to Polly’s account,\r\nwas not likely to treat them more respectfully. However, to Theresa’s\r\nsatisfaction, Bill answered with enthusiasm: “I should like it\r\ntremendously; is it to-night?”\r\n\r\n“No, to-morrow. To-day is market-day at Wrugglesby, you know; nothing\r\nhere is ever fixed on a market-day.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” Bill said, taking up her pail of water; “then it’s to-morrow?\r\nI’ll come if you will take me,” and she went away to empty the pail.\r\n\r\nTheresa watched her go, and then went into the house feeling that her\r\nguest was easy to entertain, and gave really very little trouble, in\r\nspite of Polly’s prognostications. Indeed she had been very glad of her\r\ncompany ever since her arrival, and especially so to-day as Robert had\r\ngone to market and was not likely to be back till late. The day seemed\r\nall the shorter for the girl’s presence in the house. The weather was\r\ngray and cloudy, and Theresa had a headache; she was very glad Bill was\r\nwith her in the afternoon. Later on, in the evening, when her headache\r\nbecame bad, she was persuaded by her young cousin to go to bed and\r\nleave her to wait for Robert.\r\n\r\n“I hardly like to go; you don’t think it will seem unkind?” Theresa\r\noffered this last protest standing by the door, her candle in her hand.\r\n\r\n“No, of course not, I’ll explain.”\r\n\r\nBill somehow knew, though Theresa did not, that Robert did not view\r\nthings in the same light as his wife did; so she persuaded her to go to\r\nbed and settled herself by the fire until the servant was ready to go\r\nup-stairs. After that she went round the house and fastened the doors,\r\nstanding a moment in the hall curiously impressed by the silence of\r\nthe place. “I have never been up alone in a sleeping house before,”\r\nshe meditated as she put out the light and stretched out her hands in\r\nthe darkness as if to feel to the full the sense of solitary night. At\r\nthat moment she remembered that she had fastened the back door which\r\nTheresa had told her particularly to leave unlocked, as Robert always\r\nlet himself in that way.\r\n\r\nShe went back and unfastened it, turned the handle to see if it were\r\nreally unbolted, and stood a moment looking out. The night-breeze\r\nstirred her hair; the moist fragrance of the earth came to her; she\r\ndrew her breath in deeply, slowly, turning her head from side to side,\r\nlistening to the intense stillness; it seemed to her that she could\r\nalmost hear things growing. Her heart began to beat faster; the blood\r\nin her veins stirred in unison with the moving sap in the hidden trees;\r\nsome wild creature of the woods was waking in her, bidding her go forth\r\ninto the darkness. A board creaked; it was only the timbers settling\r\ndown for the night, but it recalled her to the house and to her task of\r\nwaiting for its master’s return. With a last glance at the cloudy sky,\r\nshe went in and shut the door.\r\n\r\nThere was another that night who found it dark, so dark that more than\r\nonce he missed his way in the deep lanes which lay between Sales Green\r\nand Ashelton. More than once he anathematised the business which led\r\nhim to come home from Wrugglesby market by way of the little village;\r\nthe cross-roads were intricate and in bad repair, and under the\r\ndarkness of the trees it was impossible to see so much as the hedgerow\r\nelms on either side. At last he heard the sound of wheels away on the\r\nleft; he was clear of the lanes and out on the high road now; just as\r\nhe emerged a vehicle without lights passed, or rather, nearly collided\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nHe pulled his horse up and demanded angrily: “Where the devil are you\r\ngoing? If you want the whole road you might at least carry lights so\r\nthat one can see what you are doing!”\r\n\r\n“Where--going ’self?” a thick voice retorted. “Damn your clumsiness!\r\nWha’--what ’yer mean by running a man down li’ that!”\r\n\r\n“Where are you trying to go?” The man was evidently too drunk to be\r\nargued with.\r\n\r\n“Home;--that’sh if--if can get there. Brute pulls li’--like the devil.”\r\n\r\n“You had better let me drive you home, Morton--it is Morton? I expect I\r\ncan see better in the dark than you can.”\r\n\r\nMorton raised no objection and the other dismounted as he spoke and\r\nclimbed up beside him. “Pleashed, I’m sure,” Robert muttered. “Been to\r\nmarket? Oh, forgot,--saw you there myself, but you lef’ early; very\r\ncred’able, Mr. Harborough, you’ shober young man.”\r\n\r\nHe laughed in a maudlin way, and they started on a straight course in\r\nthe darkness, Harborough’s horse, fastened by the bridle, trotting\r\nbehind. A straight road lay before them, the ground rising clear from\r\nthe shade of the trees, just showing paler against the blackness,\r\nthen sloping gently downwards to deeper shadow until the turning by\r\nthe village; there the road forked, now to the left, through the open\r\ngateway, up the chase, and so to the stables and home.\r\n\r\n“Come on, ol’ chap, come in and have a--a glass of whishky,--don’t b’\r\nunsociable.”\r\n\r\nHarborough hesitated and thought of Mrs. Morton. He glanced up at the\r\nhouse; there was a light in one of the lower windows, the rest were\r\ndark--was she sitting up for her husband? He thought of the young wife\r\nwith her serene, unconscious face, waiting for this, and yielding to\r\nthe affectionate pressure on his arm he went in.\r\n\r\n“There does not seem to be any one up,” he said, as he opened the door\r\nand paused on the threshold.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, sure to be, sure--confound--”\r\n\r\nAs Morton stumbled, Harborough held him up, and then stood listening a\r\nmoment. The house was very quiet except for the chirping of crickets\r\nin the kitchen. Guided more by instinct than by his companion he made\r\nhis way to Mrs. Morton’s favourite sitting-room and opened the door,\r\nexpecting yet dreading to meet the sweet face of the young wife. But\r\nshe was not there; involuntarily he breathed a sigh of relief and\r\nbraced himself to face her substitute. There was a substitute, someone\r\ncurled up in the big chair by the fire, a slim young girl. She had been\r\nreading, and apparently had but just discovered their presence in the\r\nhouse, for she only looked up from her book as they entered.\r\n\r\n“Theresa has gone to bed,” she said, rising as she spoke. She did not\r\nseem at all surprised to see them both. Harborough wondered if she\r\nunderstood, or if Morton returned in this condition so often that she\r\nwas prepared for it. “Poor Theresa’s head was so bad that I persuaded\r\nher to go, and to let me sit up,” she added.\r\n\r\n“That ’ch al’right, you’n I--quite happy without her,” Morton said\r\nthickly, smiling upon the girl.\r\n\r\n“You won’t want to disturb her to-night,” she went on. “Her head is\r\never so bad; you will sleep in the blue room, won’t you? That will do\r\nnicely.”\r\n\r\n“That’ll do--we won’t dish’turb her, poor--poor T.”\r\n\r\n“Is the room ready?” Harborough asked quickly.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head, and flitted away with light noiseless feet. Morton\r\nstretched out a hand to detain her, but she passed him like a shadow\r\nand was gone.\r\n\r\n“Make her sing when ’comes back--sing to you,--cap’tal song.”\r\n\r\nHarborough turned away abruptly. Evidently she had not expected this\r\nsort of home-coming, or surely the room would have been ready. Probably\r\nit had not occurred before, to Mrs. Morton’s knowledge at least; if\r\nit had, she would never have left this child to face it alone; for a\r\nchild she was, fifteen, sixteen perhaps, but a child certainly. A great\r\nanger rose in Harborough’s heart against the man who had brought his\r\nbeastliness home here. He glanced round the room, which impressed him\r\nas daintily feminine, doubtless arranged by the bride nine months ago.\r\nHer work-basket stood on the table, a few spring flowers were on the\r\nmantelpiece; the whole place was pathetically eloquent of her presence.\r\nHarborough picked up a book which lay on the table and looked at the\r\ntitle--ROMANCES AND DROLLS OF THE WEST OF ENGLAND--an old book of\r\nWest Country legends and folk-lore, fairy tales of a primitive order,\r\nthe book that the girl, who had just left the room, had been reading.\r\nPleasant to call a child from her fairy-stories to meet a drunkard!\r\n\r\n“Now come to bed.” She had returned as noiselessly as she had gone.\r\n\r\n“Bed? Not ’f I know it!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, come along.”\r\n\r\n“I will see Mr. Morton to bed,” Harborough said. “Which is the room?\r\nNo, tell me, don’t trouble to come.”\r\n\r\n“Second door from the top of the stairs,” was the direction she\r\ngave, and Harborough, coercing his charge, went up-stairs. With the\r\ndoor safely shut on them he used more force than persuasion, feeling\r\nheartily sick of the whole business. When he came down again the girl\r\nwas in her old position, reading her fairy-book as before.\r\n\r\n“Is he in bed?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Are you alone here--I mean, are you going to shut the house up?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, all that is still open. I must, you see, there is no one else.\r\nYou can’t do it when you are outside, and you won’t want to stop in to\r\ndo it; it is not difficult.”\r\n\r\n“No. You are rather young to be left alone--I won’t keep you up;\r\ngood-night.”\r\n\r\nShe went to the door with him, the one opening on to the yard by\r\nwhich he and Morton had entered a little while before. On the step he\r\nhesitated; he was standing in shadow, she in the light of the lantern\r\nshe had brought that she might see to fasten the door after him.\r\n\r\n“If I were you,” he said doubtfully, “I should not disturb Mr. Morton\r\nmore than I could help. I would not pass his room unless it were\r\nnecessary.”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\nNevertheless, after he had gone she stole noiselessly to the door\r\nand turned the key outside for fear the sleeper should awake and\r\ndisturb Theresa in the night. But then that was quite necessary in her\r\nopinion, and no one was the wiser, for she unlocked it again between\r\nfour and five in the morning.\r\n\r\nAs for Harborough, having given the caution, he felt satisfied and\r\nafter repeating “good-night” went down the yard. He looked back\r\nonce before she closed the door. She was still standing in the same\r\nposition, the lantern in her hand, an elfin thing in its glow against\r\nthe brown shadows of the passage, herself all brown and red, skin and\r\nhair and eyes, colours such as Rembrandt loved. She moved, scattering\r\nsplashes of light from her lantern, then shut the door; and Harborough\r\nmounted his horse and rode a good mile home to Crows’ Farm."

      "content": "HARBOROUGH OF CROWS’ FARM.\r\n\nNobody could make farming pay, at least no one about Wrugglesby.\r\nThis was an axiom in the Ashelton district, which no one attempted\r\nto confute though each had an explanation for it, according to his\r\npolitical opinions and education, or want of education. But one and all\r\nbelieved it, though they continued to farm and to grumble, both the\r\nsmall men and the great. The small men were very small, little more\r\nthan peasant tenants with neither the capital nor the ability to farm\r\ntheir small holdings with any show of justice to the starved land,\r\nliving from hand to mouth, employing no labour, themselves and their\r\nfamilies practically doing the work, and doing it indifferently. The\r\ngreat men were quite another class, a cross between a landed gentry\r\nand a yeoman squirearchy, socially ranking with the professional\r\nclasses and for all practical purposes supplying the place of the\r\ncounty-families, now for the most part either impoverished or else\r\nremoved to more congenial centres. The greater farm-owners undoubtedly\r\ndid make some profit out of the land, or appeared to do something very\r\nlike it, though possibly they might have done so more successfully had\r\nthey inclined more towards the yeoman squirearchy and less towards the\r\nlanded gentry in their tastes and habits.\r\n\r\nAt least such was the opinion of one who, a little more than six months\r\nprevious to Bill’s advent in the Morton household, had come to settle\r\namong the yeoman-farmers and to prove to himself and to them some of\r\nthe theories he held with regard to farming. His theory-in-chief was a\r\nshort one, and could be summed up in one word,--work. A working farmer\r\ncould make it pay; there were one or two of the old-fashioned sort of\r\nlarge working farmers still left, who made it pay, even though they had\r\nno social position and wanted none. Their net profits were small, it\r\nis true, but then they had not the benefit of a modern education; they\r\nwere also abnormally pig-headed, and, in spite of experience, would\r\ndo as their fathers had done in the palmy days of Protection. Young\r\nGilchrist Harborough was of opinion that, were it only possible to\r\nunite the work in detail of these men with the knowledge and capital of\r\nthe gentleman-class, results of surprising grandeur could be obtained.\r\n\r\nHe held this theory long ago, before ever he saw the English farmer\r\nat work; he held it still more firmly now that fate had given him\r\nan opportunity of putting it to the test. The opportunity had come\r\nunexpectedly in the shape of a legacy from a friend of his father’s,\r\na man who had at one time stayed in the bush home where Gilchrist\r\nwas reared, and who, half amused and half pleased by the young man’s\r\nearnestness, had left him Crows’ Farm and a sufficiency on which to try\r\nhis theories on a small scale.\r\n\r\nAn unpretentious, whitewashed building was the farm, not unlike two\r\ncottages knocked into one. For many years it had been inhabited by a\r\nbailiff who farmed the adjoining land, the owner, frequently absent\r\nabroad, only coming down for the partridge-shooting. Ashelton was fond\r\nof this man, and genuinely sorry to hear of his death; he was the kind\r\nof man those good folks understood, and was sadly missed at the social\r\nfunctions which always took place in September and in which he usually\r\njoined. But the new owner, the young Australian to whom he had left\r\nthe farm, was something of a puzzle to them. Of course he had a right\r\nto his theories: everyone has in these highly educated days; but it\r\nis not everyone who tries to put his theories into practice, nor who,\r\nmoreover, has such uncomfortable ones. Harborough lived the life of a\r\nworking farmer in his little old house; lived, so report said, almost\r\nlike Robinson Crusoe, doing his own cooking and cleaning, rising early\r\nand sharing even the most menial toil with his few labourers. This\r\nwas not all strictly correct, but it was near enough to the truth\r\nto satisfy Ashelton, and the parish talked and wondered, and said\r\ndubiously that the experiment might answer, questioning for a while how\r\nMr. Harborough would be received. But in the winter the question was\r\nsettled by Mrs. Dawson, who, perhaps, alone was capable of settling it\r\nfinally. She, under the influence of her son Jack, decided that Mr.\r\nHarborough was as one of themselves, notwithstanding his theory and his\r\ncolonial origin,--a decision which scarcely did justice to Harborough,\r\nbut gave great satisfaction to everyone, even including Mr. Dane, the\r\nold rector. He, indeed, had seemed particularly to appreciate it, and\r\nhad even listened to Mrs. Dawson’s judgment on the case with a faint\r\nsmile flickering in his grey eyes. It is true he made Harborough’s\r\nacquaintance without waiting for Mrs. Dawson’s decision, but then,\r\nas she said, the rector, of course, knew everybody. Mr. Johnson, the\r\ncurate, being only a curate, had waited for her decision.\r\n\r\nBut none of these matters troubled Harborough. He lived his life in\r\nhis own way, working hard as long as he was able, smoking hard when\r\nwork was done; reading sometimes, and the books had nothing to do with\r\nthe theory, neither were they such as Jack Dawson would have chosen;\r\ndreaming sometimes in spite of the theory, in spite also of the pure\r\nreason with which he was still young enough to believe he governed his\r\nlife. Of his neighbours he thought little; he was friendly when he came\r\nacross them, but with the friendliness of the self-contained man who\r\nregards the rest of his kind as supernumeraries, necessary parts of\r\nthe world-play, but as well filled by one set of actors as by another.\r\nHe knew about his neighbours, of course, since he could not well live\r\nin Ashelton without doing so; but he did not care greatly about them,\r\nnor was there any reason to care; nothing to his knowledge had gone\r\nseriously wrong or seriously right in Ashelton until that night when he\r\ntook Robert Morton home.\r\n\r\nThat night there had been something seriously wrong, and the more\r\nhe thought about Morton, the more wrong the whole matter seemed.\r\nDrunkenness looked such a beastly thing in this quiet little village,\r\nin that peaceful home with that fair young wife. “The man’s a brute,”\r\nwas his disgusted verdict, “coming home to a wife like that! Lucky it\r\nwasn’t her. By the way, I wonder who the girl was, queer little thing.”\r\n\r\nBut he did not wonder very much, for he was too sleepy that night\r\nand too busy the next day till the time when the girl revealed her\r\nidentity to him. It was somewhere about noon when he saw her, as he was\r\nreturning by a lane which bordered one side of the Haylands property.\r\nHe had been that way once before during the morning, but was not aware\r\nthat anyone had been watching him. As he came back, however, he met\r\nthe girl of last night’s adventure evidently waiting for his return.\r\nThe Morton’s orchard was here; an untidy orchard, with old stooping\r\napple-trees, lichen-covered and unpruned, a thicket of nuts and pollard\r\nquinces and, beyond, a briery tangle of blackberries. As yet there was\r\nneither flower nor leaf, except for one plum-tree near the gate white\r\nas snow in its blossom.\r\n\r\nIt was in the orchard that Harborough saw the girl. She was sitting on\r\nthe gate deliberately waiting for him, and when he came in sight she\r\nmade the fact known.\r\n\r\n“I want to speak to you,” she announced. “I have been waiting ever so\r\nlong.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry,” he answered, in some surprise; “now I have come, what can\r\nI do for you?”\r\n\r\n“It is about Robert, Robert Morton--is he often drunk?”\r\n\r\nIf Harborough had any delusions as to her not grasping the situation\r\nlast night, they were now dispelled. “I don’t know,” he said; “I have\r\nnever seen him so before.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think he often is?”\r\n\r\n“I really cannot tell you; I am only very slightly acquainted with him.”\r\n\r\nA little smile crept round the corners of the girl’s mouth. “I didn’t\r\nsuppose you were great friends,” she said.\r\n\r\nHarborough bit his lip. His tone had not implied it, yet he was\r\nconscious that there had been a slight feeling of annoyance at the\r\nsuggestion of intimacy conveyed by her words; there was now a second\r\nfeeling of annoyance that she should have discovered the first.\r\n\r\n“I am a comparatively new comer in the place,” he said somewhat\r\nstiffly; “you would perhaps do better to ask someone who has lived here\r\nlonger.”\r\n\r\n“Umph!” As she made the oracular answer she drew her legs up to the\r\ntop bar of the gate and clasped her hands round them in a position\r\nHarborough considered most unsafe. As he watched her, fascinated,\r\nwondering which way she would fall, she turned a little towards him.\r\n\r\n“Take care!” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Theresa does not know,” she said, answering her own thoughts. “She has\r\nno idea; but she will, you know.”\r\n\r\nHarborough thought it possible, but he only said: “I suppose her\r\nhusband told her he did not wish to disturb her last night?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Then I do not see how she is to know, if you do not tell her.”\r\n\r\n“No, not this time; but next,--I may not be here then.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know there will be a next time?” he asked. “You have no\r\nreason to suppose this was anything but,--but an accident which might\r\nhappen to any of us.”\r\n\r\n“You, for instance?”\r\n\r\nHer blandly innocent eyes were turned on him. “Any man,” he answered\r\nbriefly. The eyes showed neither surprise nor disgust; in fact they did\r\nnot seem much convinced, and he went on. “There is no reason to say it\r\nmust occur again; why do you?”\r\n\r\n“Why do _you_?”\r\n\r\n“I do not,” he answered; “I should be very sorry to give such a\r\ndefinite opinion on the subject.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” she replied cheerfully, “that is the difference between\r\nus. I give the opinions, you only have them, but we mean the same\r\nthing.”\r\n\r\n“I have not formed any opinion.”\r\n\r\n“No, but you know him,--not very well, I dare say,--but you know other\r\nmen. I don’t know him very well either, better than you do, of course,\r\nbut not well. I came here on Tuesday, and to-day is Friday; before that\r\nI don’t think I saw him more than six times; but, all the same, I know\r\nhe will get drunk again.”\r\n\r\n“Pray, did you expect him to be drunk last night?” Harborough asked.\r\n\r\n“No,” she answered; “I had never thought about it. Until I saw him last\r\nnight I never thought about his drinking; now, of course, I know.”\r\n\r\n“I must say you took it very coolly,” he observed, “that is, if it was\r\na revelation to you.”\r\n\r\nShe shrugged her shoulders, till he thought she must inevitably fall\r\noff the gate; she did not, but turned to him, asking, “What would you\r\nhave had me do?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing different from what you did. I meant that you did not seem at\r\nall upset.”\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t think I can be upset easily.” He unconsciously looked at\r\nthe squirrel-like perch on the gate. “You see,” she went on, “there was\r\na good deal to be done till you went; after that I thought.”\r\n\r\n“Yes?” He wondered what she thought, what sort of brain she had under\r\nthat thatch of copper-brown hair.\r\n\r\n“It is about Theresa,” she went on to explain; “she does not know, and\r\nshe must sooner or later; he is bound to let it out some time. He may\r\nhave got drunk and hidden it in the past: he may do so in the future;\r\nbut sooner or later there will come another time like last night, and\r\nshe will find out.”\r\n\r\nHe drove his stick into the ground thoughtfully. “Well,” he said at\r\nlast, “if this is all as inevitable as you say, if this takes place, I\r\nsuppose Mrs. Morton will have to bear it, as other women have borne it\r\nbefore. There is nothing else for it; we can’t help her; she will just\r\nhave to bear it.”\r\n\r\nHarborough felt this was cold comfort. It was easy talking out here in\r\nthe spring sunshine, easy adjusting the burden to the accompaniment of\r\nthe thrushes’ love-songs; but to bear it was another matter, and the\r\ngirl evidently thought so.\r\n\r\n“You don’t know Theresa,” she said. “She just can’t bear it; I think it\r\nwould kill her.”\r\n\r\nHarborough repressed a smile. “I don’t think it would do anything of\r\nthe kind,” he said, from his wider knowledge of mankind. “Mrs. Morton\r\nby this time knows, what you, too, will find out some day, that the\r\nworld is peopled with men not heroes, and that you must take men, even\r\nhusbands, as you find them, and not despair and die because they are\r\nnot heroes of romance.”\r\n\r\n“That’s just what Theresa has not found out,” Theresa’s cousin\r\npersisted, “at least not properly. She and Robert don’t quite\r\nunderstand one another, I’m afraid. It’s an awful pity for people to\r\nget married; they can’t really know one another unless they have lived\r\ntogether for a long time first. You see, T. has lived such a different\r\nlife. It was a kind of she-life, quiet and dainty and small, and nice\r\nas nice could be,--weak tea in old china and wash the cups up carefully\r\nafterwards--that is how we lived. The pity is she married Robert; it\r\nmight have answered if she had married some other man, better, perhaps,\r\nor more,--more watered down, or something; I don’t know how to say it,\r\nbut you understand how it is. They just belong to different kinds of\r\npeople.”\r\n\r\nHarborough leaned against the gate-post, the one opposite to the end\r\nof the gate on which the girl sat; he was careful not to give her the\r\nleast jar as he considered the connubial problem presented to him. “Of\r\ncourse you think Morton is to blame,” he said at last. “You would blame\r\nhim far more than your sister--cousin is it?--your cousin then. He is,\r\nI suppose, a low hound, drunken and all the rest of it?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” she answered slowly, “it isn’t so much that; he has his good\r\npoints of course, though I don’t altogether like him. It isn’t exactly\r\na case of right and wrong; it’s how the thing seems to the other\r\nperson, and it’ll seem bad to T. For myself, I don’t think I should\r\nlike getting drunk, but I don’t so much mind about things; I can\r\nunderstand how it is in a way, and besides, it is not such a sin to his\r\nnature; it isn’t nice, but it is all of a piece with himself.”\r\n\r\nHarborough nodded. “That’s so,” he said and added: “To come home drunk\r\nis not, after all, such a dreadful thing from a man’s point of view;\r\nit is not nice, as you say, but it is not the most awful thing in the\r\nworld. Life’s entire happiness does not cease because of it; it is not\r\nthe end of all things.”\r\n\r\n“No,” she said thoughtfully looking past him into some fancy picture.\r\n“No, there is always the necessity to get up and have breakfast next\r\nmorning, even after a big tragedy; things don’t end.”\r\n\r\nHe laughed a little. “Naturally not, and a good thing too on the whole,\r\nthough perhaps it is not dramatic. Why not induce Mrs. Morton to take\r\nyour truly judicial view of the case?”\r\n\r\n“My view? It couldn’t be done.”\r\n\r\n“Why not? I think I understood you to say that she had lived in the\r\nsame circumstances as yourself; if the view is possible to you, why not\r\nto her?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know, but it is not.” Bill spoke with absolute conviction.\r\n“Besides, I can’t speak about it to her; I can’t even warn her what to\r\nexpect. If she had been with me when you brought him home last night, I\r\nshould have been obliged to pretend I did not know what was the matter,\r\nand I should have kept up the pretence afterwards.”\r\n\r\n“Would you?” he said, eyeing her curiously. “I suppose you would, and\r\nshe would have helped you; women always try to hide the shortcomings of\r\ntheir loved ones. She won’t admit it when she finds him out; she will\r\nstand by him with a sort of proud deceit to the end.”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” Bill answered simply; “he is her family now, and you must\r\nstand by your family, right or wrong.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose that is what you call loyalty,” Harborough said with a\r\nlaugh. “I was born in a land where we don’t think so much of our\r\nfamilies, where we have not always reason to think much of them.”\r\n\r\n“Mine isn’t much to boast of,” Bill admitted. “But that has nothing to\r\ndo with it; I must stand by them all the same,--why, I should bolster\r\nup Polly. But we are no nearer the settling of Theresa; I suppose we\r\nnever shall be, so there is no more to be said. Thank you for telling\r\nme all you knew.”\r\n\r\n“All I didn’t know; that is what it amounts to.”\r\n\r\nShe moved as if she were going to get off the gate, then stopped in the\r\nact and said suddenly: “Polly said Robert would die of apoplexy,--die\r\nyoung. What do you think?”\r\n\r\n“I think it is a solution of the difficulty I should not dwell on, if I\r\nwere you.”\r\n\r\n“Why not? Isn’t it likely?”\r\n\r\n“I should say it was at least uncertain; also it is not usually\r\nconsidered decent to think about such things, at all events to talk\r\nabout them.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, decent!” she said, and laughed softly as she remembered Carrie’s\r\nand Alice’s lecture. Then she dropped off the gate and was immediately\r\nlost among the orchard bushes. He stood for a moment, half-expecting\r\nher to come back, though he did not know why. As she did not, he went\r\non, smiling a little.\r\n\r\nGradually the smile died away. It was all very well to smile out there\r\nin the sunshine, all very well to talk under the apple-boughs, but the\r\nfact remained, the grim, stern fact. It was no concern of his, it is\r\ntrue, but he could not help thinking about it. Of course he knew that\r\nMorton drank, not desperately, nor enough to do any serious harm, not\r\nmore than did plenty of other men, nothing more than occasionally a\r\nlittle too much; so serious an affair as last night’s occurrence would\r\nprobably be an exception. It was not exactly a cardinal sin, it was\r\njust part of his nature, as the little brown girl had said, a kind of\r\nnature for which Harborough had a tolerant contempt when regarded as\r\na detached specimen; as a personal acquaintance it naturally wore a\r\ndifferent aspect. “If a man drinks, he drinks, and it is his affair.\r\nOne can forgive lapses; we are none of us exactly bread-and-butter\r\nsaints when we are nearing the thirties.” Harborough emphasised the\r\nwords with his stick; he had almost said them aloud, not quite, but\r\nloud enough for the man, who that moment joined him, to guess part of\r\nthe speech.\r\n\r\n“Who is not a saint when he is nearing the thirties?” he asked.\r\n“Forgive me for surprising your thoughts, Mr. Harborough; you really\r\nshould not think so loud, you know.”\r\n\r\n“I will forgive you more easily than I fancy you would forgive me\r\nfor thinking them.” So Harborough answered, for he had certain very\r\ndefinite notions as to what was and what was not acceptable to the\r\nclergy, and it was a clergyman who had accosted him, the rector of\r\nAshelton on his way to the rectory by a field-path well known to at\r\nleast one of his parishioners.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Harborough misjudged this clergyman; at all events he promised\r\nforgiveness for all sins of thought before they were expressed. “I give\r\nabsolution beforehand,” he said; “now confess the whole.”\r\n\r\n“The whole? I am afraid I was speech-making to myself, a bad habit\r\nI have got from living so much alone; still you shall have it all.\r\nHere goes,--If a man drinks, he drinks, and it is his affair. One can\r\nforgive lapses; we are none of us bread-and-butter saints when we are\r\nnearing the thirties. But a man whom the divine wisdom has, it would\r\nseem, for its own purposes, made something of a beast, should keep\r\nhis beastliness for suitable places. There is a lot done ‘somewhere\r\neast of Suez’ and in other places nearer at hand, which one does\r\nnot blame a man for doing there; but when he does it in his wife’s\r\ndrawing-room,--when he is such an egregious fool, such an unmitigated\r\nbrute--why then he wants kicking, and he should be soundly kicked.”\r\n\r\nMr. Dane laughed a little, but whether at the length of the speech or\r\nthe unconscious earnestness of its delivery did not appear. “Yes,” he\r\nsaid, “yes, brutes want kicking; I’m not sure we don’t all want kicking\r\nsometimes. Poor little wife; God help the wife, whoever she is!”\r\n\r\nHarborough acquiesced. “And yet,” he said doubtfully, “if she\r\nunderstood, it would be easier, much easier; a good woman is a hard\r\njudge.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, possibly.” The rector’s cold gray eyes seemed to summon up the\r\nmemory of some good woman who had judged hardly. “They were not made to\r\nunderstand some things.”\r\n\r\n“Not all women,” Harborough interposed.\r\n\r\n“Not all; are you sure she was a good woman, this exception of yours?\r\nBut perhaps we had better not start a controversy now; it is too late.\r\nI suppose the good women will judge the bad men, and love them too, to\r\nthe end of the story. Bad men? No, I beg pardon, average men, neither\r\ngood nor bad, just human, no bread-and-butter saints--good-bye.”\r\n\r\nThey parted at the rectory-gate. Just as it closed after Mr. Dane he\r\nturned to call after Harborough: “How about the beef and beer saints?\r\nWhat of them?”\r\n\r\n“Are there any?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and they’re good for three-score years and ten.”"

      "title": "CHAPTER V.",
      "content": "FOR BILL’S GOOD.\r\n\nTheresa was a conscientious person, and really had Bill’s welfare at\r\nheart. Miss Brownlow said she exercised a good influence over her young\r\ncousin. Theresa was rather doubtful on the subject herself, but she\r\nfelt the responsibility of her aunt’s expectations, and determined to\r\nfulfil them if possible; only she did not quite know how to set about\r\nit. Bill proved so very mild; there seemed no occasion for a preventive\r\nand negative influence, and a positive one Theresa found difficult to\r\ncompass. The only definite suggestion she had as yet made for Bill’s\r\nmental and moral benefit was the invitation to the prayer-meeting.\r\nThat, both in its religious and social aspects, was good; the religious\r\nside, Theresa felt, must benefit her charge, though she did not stop\r\nto consider how, religion being to her much what charms were to her\r\nforebears, good and protective, though operating in methods neither\r\nunderstood nor questioned. The social side of the prayer-meeting was\r\nobviously beneficial, for it was in every way desirable that Bill\r\nshould mix with her elders, it would help her to grow up. Altogether\r\nthe prayer-meeting was a good thing, and to it, accordingly, Theresa\r\ntook her cousin on Friday evening.\r\n\r\nThey drove in the dog-cart: “We can walk home,” Theresa had said; “it\r\nis not far.”\r\n\r\nSo Robert, who did not affect prayer-meetings, drove them and took\r\nthe cart home again; and as Theresa disliked driving very much, this\r\narrangement suited her better than any other. It suited Bill also, for\r\nshe sat on the back seat, and was as entirely oblivious of the two in\r\nfront as if she had been alone in her silent survey of the country.\r\nIt was still very black and white, she found, though a day of showers\r\nand sunshine would alter the whole face of the land now. She was\r\nconscious of the coming change; there was a feeling of waiting in the\r\nair, as though the unconscious earth stood patient on the threshold\r\nof life. There were no leaves as yet among the elms, no blade in the\r\ndry, crumbling fields, no hint of green in the close-cut hedge, so\r\nblack by contrast with the white road. So white the road was, so hard,\r\nstretching before them, stretching behind them; Bill looked at it and\r\nthought what a long way it could be seen in the pale strong light.\r\nEvery thing could be seen, the heap of faggots, the pump by the road,\r\nthe old man working in a cottage-garden,--she could even see what kind\r\nof belt he wore; she could see everything near and far,--truly a March\r\nevening was a beautiful thing. She drew in deep breaths of the thin\r\nair; it seemed like wine within her, making the young blood dance and\r\nthrob in her veins. She felt, though she hardly knew it, that it was a\r\nsplendid thing to be alive: “I should like to live as long as the world\r\nlasts,” she thought.\r\n\r\nJust then they turned in at a gateway. The short drive beyond sloped\r\ndown rapidly and the dog-cart entered with a jerk which nearly\r\nunseated the back passenger, who, however, was examining the garden too\r\nintently to be troubled by that. There was a large raised flower-bed\r\nin the centre of the gravel sweep, the drive dividing right and left\r\nof it. It was a circular bed planted in a geometrical pattern with\r\nDutch bulbs; as yet the hyacinths and tulips were only green shoots,\r\nbut the crocuses were in full flower and wound like a coloured ribbon\r\nacross the intricate design. Bill was wondering how it was that none\r\nof the crocuses had gone blind, when the cart stopped before a square,\r\nivy-covered house.\r\n\r\n“T.,” she said, as she got down, “every single one of those crocuses\r\nhas come up; they must be a good sort.”\r\n\r\n“I dare say. Mr. Perry is fond of his garden, and he has plenty of\r\nmoney.”\r\n\r\nBill’s acquaintance with people possessing plenty of money was\r\nlimited; indeed, she could not recall anyone she knew who was in that\r\naffluent state. She looked at the Perry’s house critically to see how\r\n“plenty of money” looked when it was translated into furniture and\r\nfittings. There were lots of white curtains, three or four at every\r\nwindow. “That is expensive,” she thought; “it means so much washing.”\r\nThere were thick carpets on the floors, old-fashioned in design,\r\nexcellent in preservation, and prodigiously ugly; the furniture in the\r\ndrawing-room was rosewood, the chairs as like as peas in a pod and\r\nall neatly covered in chintz. “I shall tell Polly our things are all\r\nright,” Bill mentally determined as she sat down in a retired corner.\r\nShe had been duly presented to the host and hostess, had duly made an\r\ninaudible answer to their polite remarks, and had then sunk into her\r\ncorner, still safe under her cousin’s wing, as became one of her youth\r\nand shyness. No one in Mrs. Perry’s drawing-room expected anything\r\ndifferent; indeed all would have been surprised if she had shown\r\ngreater forwardness of demeanour. Her nearest neighbour, a little old\r\nlady with a cheerful countenance and a great mosaic brooch, spoke to\r\nher; but at first Bill could not catch what she said, for she lowered\r\nher voice out of deference to the more important persons present, until\r\nit was little more than a sigh in her listener’s ear. But after a word\r\nor two Bill became used to the sound and made out, as she might have\r\nguessed, that the subject of conversation was the weather.\r\n\r\n“Dry evening,” was the first she heard, and then “a nice walk from\r\nAshelton.”\r\n\r\nBill did not catch the connecting words, but she answered what she\r\nheard, although she did not know that she had come beyond the boundary\r\nof Ashelton that evening, and contented herself with saying that they\r\nhad not walked.\r\n\r\n“Driven?” suggested the old lady. “I expect Mr. Morton drove you and\r\ntook the pony home again; such a good arrangement, and much safer than\r\nfor Mrs. Morton to drive those spirited horses herself. I’m sure I\r\nwonder she has never had an accident; I quite thought there would be\r\none when I saw her go by on Tuesday afternoon.”\r\n\r\n“Did you see us then?” Bill asked, and her neighbour explained that\r\nshe lived at the house at the corner where the roads divided. Then\r\nBill knew that this must be Miss Minchin, the lady who, Theresa said,\r\nmade ample use of the opportunities for observation offered by the\r\ncommanding position of her house. At that moment the entrance of some\r\nfresh arrivals caused such a buzz of conversation that Miss Minchin\r\nventured to inquire in quite a loud voice whether Bill herself could\r\nmanage a horse.\r\n\r\n“I never tried until I came here,” she answered; “I only came on\r\nTuesday, but I have done a little since then. I drove a waggon of straw\r\nhome yesterday. Tom Griggs told me he thought I should soon be able to\r\nhandle most things on four legs, but I don’t suppose he knows.”\r\n\r\n“You are learning to drive?” Miss Minchin asked, somewhat mystified.\r\n“Mr. Morton is teaching you? But, my dear, do be careful, he has\r\nsuch mettlesome horses; gentlemen seem all alike for that; there’s\r\nMr. Harborough, now, he’s nearly as bad. You know Mr. Harborough?”\r\nBefore Bill could answer the old lady went on: “Hush! Mr. Perry is\r\ngoing to speak. You must come with Mrs. Morton to see me to-morrow; I\r\nhave a cat and a canary, and several things that will interest you.”\r\nThe last words were spoken in a shrill whisper in Bill’s ear as the\r\ncompany settled themselves, and Mr. Perry, a trim little man some years\r\nretired from the grocery trade, called attention to the fact that the\r\nreading was about to begin. When he had made this announcement in a\r\nredundancy of words (for he was not averse to speech-making and had few\r\nopportunities), the proceedings commenced.\r\n\r\nThe subject for the evening was faith. Mr. Johnson was giving a course\r\nof Christian virtues during that Lent, and faith happened to be the\r\none under consideration on the evening when Bill was present. She was\r\nvery much interested, though it was not a matter in which she had erred\r\ngreatly hitherto; she believed largely, had much imagination, and as\r\nyet had thought little and felt less; consequently Mr. Johnson’s\r\nflowery periods slid harmlessly off her still unconscious mind. She\r\nwas interested, at first a little in the words, afterwards entirely\r\nby the man. Mr. Johnson was a fair man with a tendency towards the\r\nsandy, smooth, slightly florid, and with more than a tendency towards\r\nplumpness. He had for many years been curate at Ashelton, and, though\r\nhe was now past middle life, it seemed that he was likely to remain\r\ncurate at Ashelton, for it appeared that the Church dignitaries had not\r\nthe same opinion of his worth as had some other people who need not be\r\nnamed. After all, curate at the three Asheltons was on the whole well\r\nenough. There was not too much work in the big straggling parish, and\r\nthere was much sociability of a sort well suited to a man who had a\r\nnice taste in tea and pale sherry, and more fancy for being a whale\r\namong minnows than a minnow among whales. At Ashelton, though perhaps\r\nnot exactly a whale, he could pass as a very tolerably sized fish\r\namong others of congenial dimensions, at all events when the rector\r\nwas not there. As for the rector--well, poor man, he was eccentric, he\r\nhad had trouble--Mr. Johnson said so leniently without any idea as to\r\nwhat the trouble was. For the eccentricity he could vouch: the rector\r\nhad a cousin who was a bishop, in a genuine, important bishopric,\r\nand another, it was hinted, who was a peer. What man, not eccentric,\r\nwould have remained all these years in a little country parish when he\r\npossessed these advantages? Then there was his passion for music, and\r\nalso his inability to appreciate Mr. Johnson. Mr. Johnson had at last\r\ncome to the conclusion that this inability did exist; yet even now he\r\nwas not sure that it was not partly the expression of a not unnatural\r\njealousy of his own social and parochial triumphs.\r\n\r\nOn that particular March evening Mr. Johnson knew that he had added\r\none more to the long list of those triumphs. It was a small matter, of\r\ncourse, but, as he told his wife, trifles like that showed how easily\r\nhe could have influenced a larger audience, had he been in command\r\nof one. The trifle in question was Bill Alardy, whose face showed\r\nhow deeply interested she was in Mr. Johnson’s words. She had the\r\nmost expressive face imaginable, and that evening it was alive with\r\ninterest. She had never taken her eyes off the speaker; she listened\r\nto every word, the tell-tale face expressing the keenest enjoyment\r\nand appreciation. So marked was this that after supper, when all were\r\nleaving, Mr. Johnson came to Theresa and shook hands with her and Bill,\r\ntelling the latter impressively that he was very glad to see her at the\r\nreading.\r\n\r\nTo this Bill answered with equal impressiveness, “I am very glad I\r\ncame.”\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson smiled encouragingly. “I shall be happy if at any time I\r\ncan be of help to you,” he said; “I am always pleased to help any one.”\r\n\r\nBill thanked him vaguely and went out with Theresa. She did not know\r\nwhat he meant, but it did not matter, as she did not feel conscious\r\nof wanting his help. In her opinion he could not improve upon that\r\nevening’s performance, which had been perfectly delightful; so\r\ndelightful that when she went to her room she thought about him until\r\nit became too much for her, and turning to the little wooden bed and\r\nthe chair which stood beside it, she addressed them, inanimate though\r\nthey were. “My brothers and sisters,” she said--and her flexible voice,\r\nfar more flexible even than her face, rolled out in unctuous tones--“my\r\nbrothers and sisters, faith is the substance of things hoped for, the\r\nonly evidence we can present to our spiritual senses, the only evidence\r\nthey need. It is the be-all and end-all, the beginning and the end of\r\nall things.” She rolled the words lovingly on her tongue, swelling\r\nher face until it became almost Johnsonian in size. “Everything is\r\nfaith, faith is everything.” Here she stretched out a persuasive hand\r\nto the quaint little bed. “In it we live and move and have our being;\r\nbeing dead, we die not if in faith, being alive, we live not without\r\nit. Whatever is, is not, whatever is not, is, was and shall be, world\r\nwithout end, amen.”\r\n\r\nBut Theresa did not hear this, and held to her first opinion as to the\r\nkind of spiritual good Bill derived from the prayer-meeting. Of the\r\nsocial good she was not so sure, until her young cousin came to her on\r\nSaturday morning and suggested that they should go and see Miss Minchin\r\nin the afternoon. “Let us go,” she said; “she promised to show me her\r\ncat and bird and other things.”\r\n\r\nTheresa acceded to the request, feeling that last night’s meeting was\r\nnot without results since it had introduced Miss Minchin, and implanted\r\na desire to visit in Bill’s mind.\r\n\r\nMiss Minchin’s house was set at the corner where the high road from\r\nWrugglesby divided, the one way to go through Ashelton to the church,\r\nthe other to the lanes and so to the more distant village of Sales\r\nGreen. “It is a terribly public place,” Miss Gruet, Miss Minchin’s\r\nparticular friend, always said with commiseration. Her own house\r\nwas privacy itself, the lower windows looking solely on the laurel\r\nbushes tall and elderly, the upper as effectually screened by a great\r\nhorse-chestnut tree. “It was most secluded,” Miss Gruet said, and, out\r\nof pity no doubt, she often left her seclusion to cheer her friend\r\nin the publicity which had fallen to her share. She did so on the\r\nafternoon when Theresa and Bill made their call, but did not arrive\r\nuntil Miss Minchin had duly shown her treasures. Bill was interested\r\nin them all,--in the cat asleep on the violet bed, only dislodged with\r\nthe end of an umbrella, and the canary before the window in a green\r\ncage with a piece of grey paper neatly tacked round the lower part\r\nto keep the seeds in and the draughts out. This piece of paper was\r\noften changed, varying in colour with the Church festivals and other\r\nimportant events, always going into mourning on the death of royalty;\r\nat least, the cage did. Black paper Miss Minchin found difficult to\r\nobtain, as she explained to Bill.\r\n\r\n“When the poor dear Duke of Clarence died,” she said, “I could not get\r\na scrap. I put a piece of black cashmere round the cage, but the little\r\nfellow (it was not this canary then but another one) did not like it a\r\nbit.”\r\n\r\nThe subject of discussion here gave a short burst of song. When he\r\nceased Miss Minchin encouraged him to continue. “Swee-e-t!” she said;\r\n“go on, my pretty, swee-e-t! He likes someone to whistle to him, but of\r\ncourse I can’t do that.”\r\n\r\n“I can,” said Bill, and gave a trilling imitation of the caged singer.\r\n\r\n“I declare,” exclaimed Miss Minchin, “it’s quite charming! I’m sure\r\nif girls had whistled like that in my young days no one would have\r\nthought it unladylike. They did think so, then, my dear, but now, to be\r\nsure, things are quite changed; everyone can do as they like, and more\r\nbesides.”\r\n\r\nIt was just then that Miss Gruet came in. “I thought you must be\r\ncoming here,” Miss Minchin said briskly. “I said so to Mrs. Morton just\r\nnow, when I saw you coming down the road.”\r\n\r\n“You can see everyone from your window,” Miss Gruet said with a touch\r\nof severity. “I do believe from your back bedroom you could almost see\r\nthe field-path that leads to the rectory.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Miss Minchin admitted, “I can if I move the toilet-glass. Of\r\ncourse I never do move it, unless it happens that the blind goes wrong,\r\nas it does sometimes. It is such a tiresome blind; I remember I had to\r\nsee to it the day Tom Davies went to put his banns up; he thought no\r\none saw him go sneaking to the rectory, but I did, for I was mending my\r\nblind.”\r\n\r\nMiss Gruet professed herself properly shocked--and interested. “There\r\nis no telling what you might not see,” she said, “and Mr. Dane a\r\nbachelor too!”\r\n\r\nMiss Minchin hastened to assure the company that she had never seen\r\nanything bad; indeed, only yesterday morning, when the troublesome\r\nblind went wrong again, she had seen quite a pleasant sight--Mr. Dane\r\nand young Mr. Harborough in earnest conversation. “So nice,” she said,\r\n“for a young man like that to be such friends with the rector.”\r\n\r\nThe others agreed with her, and talked over this item of intelligence\r\nin all its aspects. A little later, Theresa and Miss Gruet being at the\r\ntime deep in a discussion of the difficulty of preventing mice from\r\neating cheese-mats, Bill led the conversation back to Harborough.\r\n\r\n“The Harboroughs of Gurnett,” she said; “does this Mr. Harborough\r\nbelong to them?”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed,” Miss Minchin answered, almost shocked at the idea. “The\r\nHarboroughs of Gurnett are the Harboroughs of Wood Hall, one of the\r\noldest families of the county, just as Wood Hall is one of the finest\r\nplaces. At least, it used to be, but times are sadly changed from what\r\nthey were. The Harboroughs are poor now and cannot afford to keep the\r\nplace up; not but what it is fine still,--have you ever seen it?”\r\n\r\n“No, but I have heard about it,” Bill said eagerly. “There is a room\r\nthere, the library I think, with a fireplace so big that a quadrille\r\ncould be danced on the hearth; and the great hall is so wide that a\r\ncoach and four could turn in it without touching the wall on either\r\nside.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my dear, yes.” The old lady’s tone was sad, as of one who\r\nremembers departed greatness. “Yes; so they say; they say many things\r\nabout the place. It is sad to think of the way in which it is being\r\nleft, sad to think of the Harboroughs, a good old family.”\r\n\r\n“I thought they were bad,” Bill remarked, remembering the common report\r\nof the district.\r\n\r\n“So they were, bad and extravagant too; they nearly all were, and that\r\nis why they are so poor now.”\r\n\r\nBill did not express any opinion on good old families which were also\r\nbad; she only remarked meditatively, “I think I shall go to Wood Hall.”\r\n\r\n“You can’t,” Miss Minchin said; “Mr. Harborough lives there now.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but parts of the grounds are open, are they not? I could see\r\nthem, as much as can be seen.”\r\n\r\n“I would not, if I were you.” Miss Minchin’s voice was a solemn warning.\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Because,--it does not seem exactly right for a young girl to go into\r\nthose grounds.”\r\n\r\n“But why?”\r\n\r\nMiss Minchin dropped her voice half a tone lower. “Mr. Harborough is a\r\nbad old man,” she said, “a very wicked old man. It does not become me\r\nto speak ill of one in his station, belonging to this county too; still\r\nfacts are facts and they are terrible.”\r\n\r\n“What has he done?”\r\n\r\nBill showed, or Miss Minchin thought she showed, too much interest in\r\nthe subject, and, either because she would not, or else because she\r\ncould not, she gave no further information. Whereupon Bill, failing to\r\nhear anything about the one Mr. Harborough turned to the other.\r\n\r\n“Is he related to the Wood Hall people?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“No, oh dear, no,” Miss Minchin answered. “He is an Australian, or\r\na New Zealander, or something American and colonial; I am rather\r\nuncertain about those places, but he comes from one of them. Besides,\r\nmy dear, consider, he is a farmer, nothing but a farmer,--a very good\r\nprofession; I am not saying anything against it,” she added, hastily\r\nremembering Theresa’s husband; “indeed, I should be very sorry to,\r\nseeing that all the patriarchs were farmers, so to say. Still, you must\r\nadmit it is not quite suitable to a member of the county-families. I\r\nknow old families are not respected as they used to be, but no one\r\nwould think of classing them with farmers even now.”\r\n\r\nBill acquiesced and then observed: “It is queer he should have the same\r\nname.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t know,” Miss Minchin said, bridling a little. “It is not\r\nsuch an uncommon name; besides the old families spread so. Long ago\r\nthey were, no doubt, much larger than they now are; there is no telling\r\nwhere all the younger branches go.”\r\n\r\n“You think he is a younger branch? Then he should be as good as the\r\nothers.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not: for one reason he has not lived in the same place so\r\nlong; he and his forebears have gone out from among the family; they\r\nhave not kept up the family traditions. There are many traditions in\r\na family like that, many, and much property too. Why, do you know the\r\nside chapel in our parish church is the property of the Harboroughs?”\r\n\r\nBill did not know it, neither did she see the force of it as an\r\nargument; nevertheless she was interested. “The whole chapel?” she\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n“Yes, the little chapel and the little altar and all complete. Of\r\ncourse they never go there, for they are Catholics. I sometimes\r\nthink perhaps if Mr. Harborough had not been a Catholic--but there!\r\nWe mustn’t be uncharitable. Do you like reading? Yes? Then I should\r\nadvise you to read the history of the county; you will find all about\r\nWood Hall there and many other things you will like. I don’t think\r\nMrs. Morton has a history, but Miss Gruet has a very nice book of\r\nSelections, which I have no doubt she will lend to you; I do believe I\r\nhave it in the house now.” She had borrowed it when Harborough first\r\ncame and had not yet returned it. “We can ask her to allow you to take\r\nit home with you; I’m sure she will.”\r\n\r\nThis Miss Gruet expressed herself happy to do, and Bill carried the\r\nbook away with her when she left with Theresa a few minutes later."

      "title": "CHAPTER VI.",
      "content": "THE RIGHT OF WAY.\r\n\nThe parish church of Ashelton was very old. It was said in Miss Gruet’s\r\nselected history of the county to be of great antiquarian interest; but\r\nantiquaries did not abound in Ashelton, and neither the inhabitants nor\r\ntheir friends troubled their heads much about the stone-work of the\r\nfourteenth century, or any of the other commended points of interest.\r\nAt one time there had been a couple of letters in a Wrugglesby paper\r\nabout a little Last Judgment window of obscure meaning; but the letters\r\nhad long been forgotten, and the rector’s new organ partly hid the\r\nwindow now.\r\n\r\nBill paid particular attention to the window on the first Sunday that\r\nshe went to Ashelton church; but she had just been reading about it and\r\nknew where to look for it. For the rest, that which chiefly pleased\r\nher were the grinning goblin faces which looked out from the capitals\r\nof pillars and the niches of windows,--from every place where the\r\nold builders could put them; there was even one carved at the end of\r\nTheresa’s pew. Everybody had a pew, and almost everybody went to church\r\nin Ashelton. The Morton’s pew was conveniently situated for keeping an\r\neye on the rest of the congregation. There was only one better placed\r\nfor that purpose, Miss Minchin’s; but she, as she always maintained,\r\nhad not selected it herself, her dear mother having done so long before\r\nher time,--in which case, it is possible to conceive that Miss Minchin\r\ninherited her tastes, as well as her pew, from her mother. Bill, from\r\nher place of vantage, looked at everybody, and everybody, with even\r\ngreater interest, looked at her. In fact so much did they look that\r\nshe, though as a rule somewhat indifferent on the subject of clothes,\r\nwas rather glad that Polly had furbished up her winter hat before she\r\nleft Wrugglesby. She gave the hat a little pull forward as she thought\r\nof it, and looked across Mrs. Perry’s purple bonnet to the Harborough\r\nchapel. It was to the left of the chancel, a step higher than the main\r\nbody of the church and in a measure cut off from it by a continuance\r\nof the slender oak screen which stood before the chancel itself. Bill\r\nlooked at it thoughtfully, opining that there could never have been\r\nenough Harboroughs to fill it, unless they brought their servants with\r\nthem. There was a small altar with a cross upon it, and above, an old\r\nwindow where fat cherubs smiled in starch-blue smoke. She wondered what\r\nits meaning was, as others had wondered before her, and came to the\r\nconclusion that it was a pity the starch clouds, if they were clouds,\r\nwere not red instead of blue: “It could not possibly make the place\r\ndarker than it now is,” she thought, “and it would look very much\r\nnicer.”\r\n\r\nIt is to be feared that Bill did not pay very much attention to the\r\nsermon. She looked about her over much, but she could still say with\r\ntruth, when asked by Miss Gruet afterwards, that she had enjoyed the\r\nservice, for she had a keen ear for music, and the music at Ashelton\r\nchurch was very good. She listened with rapt attention to what Miss\r\nMinchin called “the set pieces,” and joined enthusiastically in the\r\nhymns, singing loud and sweet, for though her flexible voice was\r\nperhaps better suited to the mimicry of other sounds than anything\r\nelse, it still possessed a rich sweetness in its many-noted variations.\r\n\r\nWhen Bella came home from visiting Theresa in the winter she confessed\r\nto Polly that she had found Sunday afternoon a little dull; that is to\r\nsay the first Sunday afternoon; on the second she had gone for a walk\r\nand--Bill had not heard any more, so she did not know what prevented\r\nthe second Sunday afternoon from being as dull as the first. She did\r\nnot herself find the afternoon dull, as she went up to the garret to\r\nlook over some books. Theresa in bringing away her girlish treasures\r\nfrom Miss Brownlow’s had accidentally brought a few things which were\r\nnot hers.\r\n\r\n“I have been meaning to take them back several times,” she said, “but I\r\nkeep forgetting. I really hardly know what they are now; there are one\r\nor two books belonging to Polly and to you, or your father. I put them\r\nin a box in the garret when I had to turn the spare room out; you might\r\nget them down some time and put them with your things, if you will.”\r\n\r\nBill said she would, and chose Sunday afternoon to do it. She left\r\nRobert and Theresa reading and dozing by the fire with the port and\r\noranges on the table beside them. “Don’t you want any dessert?” Theresa\r\nhad said. But Bill did not care about port and oranges; she filled\r\nher pocket with nuts and went to the garret to eat them while she\r\nlooked over the books. These she found in a lidless packing-case neatly\r\ncovered over with brown paper. The one on the top was HOLY LIVING AND\r\nDYING. “That’s Auntie’s: Theresa must have got it from the top shelf\r\nin the dining-room; the books there were mostly hers; I suppose she\r\nthought they all were and took the lot.” The next was a small brown\r\nvolume, PLAIN TRUTHS FOR PLAIN PEOPLE, in which she found Polly’s\r\nname--“That’s just the book for Polly; a plain person she certainly\r\nis, and the plain truth is a very good thing for her to start on,\r\nconsidering how she can trim it.” The two volumes were laid aside, and\r\nthe next dive into the box brought out a book she was pleased to see\r\nbut did not before know that they possessed, an old history of that\r\npart of the county. “Whose is this, I wonder?--why, it’s mine!” She had\r\nturned to the first page and seen her own name Wilhelmina Alardy.\r\n\r\n“That’s funny,”--she was cracking her nuts with her teeth as she\r\nlooked. “At least, I don’t know that it is so funny after all; I expect\r\nit was stuck up at the top with the other old things, so I never knew\r\nabout it. Of course I am not that Wilhelmina; that’s Grandmother.”\r\n\r\nBill looked long at the book, for she had not many relics, or even\r\ntales, of her own grandmother, as she counted her father’s mother in\r\ndistinction from her mother’s mother whom she shared equally with the\r\ncousins. There was not, to be sure, much of this lady to share; not\r\none of the four cousins had even a memory of her, though of their own\r\ngrandmothers the others each had something to tell. Polly had a good\r\nmany tales about hers, with an ugly old portrait, too, and a heavy\r\nlocket she used to wear. Bella and Theresa could remember theirs\r\nplainly; they had stayed with her when they were little girls, and\r\nstill had the coral necklaces she gave them the last Christmas she was\r\nalive. But Bill had neither tales nor trinkets; her parents had both\r\ndied when she was very young, and Miss Brownlow knew no traditions of\r\nthe Alardys and few facts concerning them, except that Bill’s father\r\nwas an only son, and that for relations the girl must depend on her; so\r\nit happened that Bill knew little about her grandmother, except that\r\nshe herself was named after her. There was a little wooden box-ottoman\r\nin the spare bedroom at Langford House, which, she had been told,\r\nused to belong to this grandmother. She had looked inside it once and\r\nfound nothing but papers, which did not prove very interesting; a few\r\nletters, not easy to decipher and not, so far as she had tried them,\r\nentertaining; half a dozen bills, part of an old account-book, some\r\nrecipes for cough-mixture and tea-cakes, a few odd sheets of paper\r\nand manuscript music, and some legal-looking documents which were\r\nquite beyond her comprehension. The greater part of this miscellaneous\r\ncollection seemed to have belonged to her mother; a few of the less\r\nintelligible were of an older date, and the music and some scraps of\r\npoetry were not dated at all. Bill had thought of carrying the poetry\r\naway, as the only thing there which interested her; but since she had\r\ngone to the box without Miss Brownlow’s permission, she decided that\r\nshe had better not take anything out, and learned the lines by heart\r\ninstead. Then she shut the box, and gave up any hope of boasting as\r\nintimate an acquaintance with her grandmother as the other cousins did\r\nwith theirs.\r\n\r\nThat was in the winter. She had not thought any more about it until\r\nthis Sunday afternoon when she unexpectedly came upon the history\r\nof the county with her grandmother’s name on the fly-leaf. She was\r\ndelighted with her discovery, partly because it was her grandmother’s,\r\nbut chiefly because it was the very book she wanted. Settling herself\r\ncomfortably on an empty tea-chest, she proceeded to study it and the\r\nold map of the district which she found folded inside. When at last she\r\nwas called down-stairs for tea she was still full of her treasure, and\r\ntold Robert and Theresa about it. They listened, amused by the interest\r\nshe attached to it and the attraction she found in both book and map.\r\n\r\n“I believe the map must be a good one,” she said at last; “it is so\r\nclear, I think I could find my way anywhere by it.”\r\n\r\n“Where do you want to find your way?” Robert asked smiling.\r\n\r\n“Oh, to lots of places, to Gurnett for one. I think I shall walk to\r\nGurnett to-morrow; may I, Theresa?”\r\n\r\n“It is rather a long way, but go if you like.” Theresa perhaps thought\r\na long walk would be better for her young cousin than spending too much\r\ntime with the animals in the yard.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, accordingly, Bill, armed with her map and some\r\nsandwiches for refreshment by the way, started on her walk. The\r\ndistance might be long, but she could not remember any time in her life\r\nwhen she had been really tired. It seemed to her that mere walking\r\nwas not enough, and once fairly started in the lonely lanes and quiet\r\nfields, she broke into a run for pure lightness of heart and ecstasy\r\nof living. Soon she was out on a road again, and here she walked more\r\nsoberly, looking to right and left, noting the veil of green that was\r\nspreading over the hedges, enjoying to the full the day and the walk\r\nand the solitude.\r\n\r\nAnd so Gurnett was reached, almost too soon, and the sandwiches eaten\r\nbehind a grassy bank, very much too soon considering it was not yet\r\ntwelve. After that the map was pulled out and considered thoughtfully.\r\nIt was some time before she could find on it the exact spot where she\r\nnow was, but at last she did. “Here I am, here--oh, yes, these must be\r\nthe cross-roads; there is Wood Hall, over there, and here comes the\r\nlane between, the second turning after the cross-roads. The little\r\npath ought to cross just where the road joins the lane; I wonder if I\r\nshall find it; it seems to go straight from Corbycroft on one side of\r\nthe lane to Wood Hall on the other, or rather to the little church in\r\nWood Hall grounds. I don’t see what it can have been made for, but it\r\nmust be a real path since it is marked; if anyone says anything to me I\r\nshall show him the map.”\r\n\r\nHaving come to this satisfactory conclusion Bill folded up her map and\r\nwent on. In due time she came to the junction of the road and lane, but\r\nthere was no indication that a footpath existed in any direction. In\r\nfact, the country itself on the left-hand side had undergone something\r\nof a change, for whereas her map showed that there had been a sort of\r\npark, the property of the distant hall, Corbycroft, there now seemed\r\nto be nothing but pasture-fields. She climbed the steep bank, the lane\r\nhere being considerably below the level of the fields, and looked\r\nround. There was nothing but pasture-land, green, curving, sloping\r\ngradually away from her. A clump of elms stood in the centre, beautiful\r\ntrees, tawny with the catkins which hung from their black branches;\r\nbut there was no park, only pasture-land sloping down to the farm in\r\nthe distance. And the farm looked very much as if it were a farm and\r\nnot a hall; perhaps it was the remains of the old hall patched up and\r\nserving as a farm-house; though, to be sure, her history had spoken of\r\na hall, a small off-manor belonging to the Corbys, a family who seemed\r\nto have had their head-quarters and more important property away in the\r\nnorth of the county, in the direction of the coast. The map and history\r\nwere alike old, and Bill was forced to admit that things might have\r\nchanged since they were made.\r\n\r\nBut if the left side of the lane was disappointing, the right more\r\nthan fulfilled expectations. The ground sloped sharply up on that\r\nside; Wood Hall evidently stood on a hill and appeared to be hidden\r\namong trees, for the slope as far as Bill could see was covered with\r\nwood. It was not a trim park but a thicket, a wild young forest\r\ngrowing up as it could about the stumps of veteran oaks and beeches\r\nlong since sacrificed to the axe. In some places the young trees\r\nalmost choked each other with their crowded growth; in others they\r\nstruggled for existence with the old pollards that still held their\r\nground. Brambles and moss and last year’s fern covered the paths and\r\nchoked the water-courses; here and there a tree, too lightly rooted to\r\nwithstand the winters’ storms, or too old to bear the weight of its\r\nyears, had fallen and lay as it fell. All was neglected, all growing,\r\nin crowded thicket or open glade, as only nature unassisted can grow;\r\nfor it was genuine woodland, where the sunshine filtered through a\r\nclose-woven roof of branches and chased dancing shadows over last\r\nyear’s leaves; thickets of thorn breaking into leaf, primroses hiding\r\nin the moss at their feet; beeches, tall and straight as pillars of\r\nstone, a cathedral twilight in their shade; pollard oaks still brown in\r\nsheltered places; the glossy darkness of holly, the stately grace of\r\nslim young larches lightly tasselled in earliest green; silver birches,\r\nold trees, their white bark cracked and swelled, blackened by many\r\nyears; young trees, a lace-work of branches, a tangle of supple stems\r\nand bursting buds.\r\n\r\nBill was over the low boundary fence now. There was no evidence of a\r\npath, but there ought to have been; it was marked on her map and she\r\nwas going to find it, so she began the ascent in the direction in which\r\nit should have been. Up she went, the ground soft and irregular, here\r\nthe dead leaves of many years blown into hollows rustling about her\r\nfeet, there the rich black earth patched with moss, emerald and gray\r\nand golden brown. An old pollard lay as it had fallen; about its head\r\nfungus had gathered, and under its side primroses grew. Higher up,\r\nwhere the leaves were fewer, in sheltered ledges, beneath the twisty\r\ncoils of beech-roots there were more primroses, plenty of them, and\r\neverywhere anemones, fairy flowers that danced among the dead bracken.\r\nThe sun, hidden by the hill, looked down through the forest aisles,\r\nthreading the whole place with arrows of light so that all around there\r\nwas a lattice of woven light and shadow, while, before, there lay a\r\npath golden as Jacob’s way to heaven.\r\n\r\nInvoluntarily the girl stood still, clasping her hands tight on one\r\nanother, while her breath came fast. All round stretched this living\r\nwoodland, thrilling with its growing, stirring life; the bare trees,\r\nbrown and purple and deep blue in their shadows, yet touched with the\r\nbreath of spring, faintest green, or gold, or sparkling where the sun\r\ncaught their yet unopened buds. The very earth was audible, alive, as\r\nit breathed forth its moist sweetness; and the birds sang their anthem\r\nof praise for the world’s eternal, ever recurring youth.\r\n\r\nShe stood, a little brown figure in the lonely wood, her whole\r\nsoul going out to the great mother Earth, her heart filled with a\r\npassionate, inarticulate gladness. “Oh, God!” she said, “how good, how\r\ngood it all is!”\r\n\r\nShe said it aloud because she had not outgrown that stage of savagedom\r\nwhich feels, with the Druids of old, that God is in the woods. A\r\nchaffinch on a crab-tree above her head looked down and to another hid\r\nin the catkinned branches of a hornbeam cried, “Come and see, what d’ye\r\nthink! What d’ye think!” And the other replied with exactly the same\r\nwords, or at least it seemed so to Bill; she listened a moment, then\r\nanswered them with a call so like their own that they might well have\r\nbeen puzzled by it if she had not at that moment begun to sing and\r\nfrightened them both to the safe distance of a higher bough--\r\n\r\n “There’s laughter for the May-time,”--\r\n\r\nShe sang and her voice was like a lark’s in its complete gladness--\r\n\r\n “The morning of the year--the year”--\r\n\r\nand the singing was merged into ripples of sound neither song nor\r\nlaughter and yet a wild sweet blending of both.\r\n\r\n“Well, young woman, I hope you are satisfied.”\r\n\r\nBill stopped abruptly and faced the speaker, an old man on the higher\r\nground just above her. He may have approached by some path hidden in\r\nthe thicket on the right, or he may have been close at hand waiting\r\ntill now to declare himself; she did not know which, neither did she\r\nknow what was expected of her, so she only answered truthfully, “Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad to hear it.” She looked puzzled, and he added abruptly: “You\r\nare trespassing,--do you know it?”\r\n\r\nThe light began to dawn on Bill’s mind; she had forgotten all about\r\nthe map and the footpath, but now she remembered and answered eagerly:\r\n“No, no, I am not really, at least I don’t think I can be; there is a\r\nfootpath somewhere about here; I can’t have got far from it.”\r\n\r\n“There is no footpath.”\r\n\r\n“But it is marked on my map,” and Bill began to unfold the paper in\r\nwhich she had for greater security wrapped her treasure.\r\n\r\n“I can’t help your map; there is no footpath here and there never was.\r\nI think I should know considering that the place belongs to me.”\r\n\r\n“Are you Mr. Harborough?” Bill’s face beamed with satisfaction.\r\n\r\n“I am; the fact seems to afford you pleasure.”\r\n\r\n“I am pleased,” Bill admitted. Having once got herself into a\r\ndifficulty she never had any hesitation about going through with it, in\r\nwhich course she was often helped by a serene unconsciousness of her\r\nposition and offences, a quality Polly reckoned high in the list of her\r\ncondemned exhibitions of no “gumption.” “I am pleased. I--I had heard\r\nabout you.”\r\n\r\n“I am indeed gratified”; he spoke with a sarcastic courtesy somewhat\r\nwasted on his hearer. “Judging by your flattering anxiety to make my\r\nacquaintance, I must conclude that what you heard was to my credit.”\r\n\r\n“It was interesting,” Bill said doubtfully.\r\n\r\nWhereupon the old man laughed. “In that case,” he said, “I must\r\nconclude it was not to my credit.”\r\n\r\nWithout replying Bill unfolded her map. “This is the footpath,” she\r\nsaid, and began tracing it with her finger.\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to see your map, child.” He was looking curiously at the\r\nsmall brown figure. “Look up,” he said, “I would rather see your face.\r\nTell me where you learnt to sing and laugh and whistle to the birds all\r\nin a breath.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know; I suppose I was made like that,” she still persistently\r\nspread out the map. “My cousin Polly,” she explained, without glancing\r\nup, “says my father was a singer, a poor one, you know, not anything\r\nmuch, but perhaps I inherited it from him. Sometimes, though, Polly\r\nsays he was a ventriloquist or even a clown; I don’t think she really\r\nknows.--See, here is the footpath.”\r\n\r\n“Whose is this map?” Mr. Harborough asked; he had taken it from her and\r\nwas examining it through a gold-rimmed glass.\r\n\r\n“Mine.”\r\n\r\n“But you did not mark that path; it was done years ago.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, when the map was made.”\r\n\r\n“No, certainly not; it was put in afterwards, that is easy to see. Even\r\nif I did not know that, as no such path exists, it could not have been\r\nprinted then or at any other time.”\r\n\r\nHe dropped his glass and handed the map back to Bill who, after looking\r\nat it a little, began to see that he was correct.\r\n\r\n“Then there is no path here after all,” she said in a tone of woful\r\ndisappointment. “I should like to know who marked it on the map?”\r\n\r\n“So should I, so should I very much. Where did you get the thing?”\r\n\r\n“I found it in an old book of my grandmother’s.”\r\n\r\n“Your grandmother?” he said impatiently. “What was your grandmother,\r\nwho was she, how did she come by the book and the map, whose were they\r\nbefore?”\r\n\r\nBill could give him no information, and he held out his hand for the\r\nmap again. She gave it to him and he examined it critically. “There\r\nwere very few people who could have put that in,” he said thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“Then there is a path!” Bill exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“No, there is not, and there never was. Come with me, just a few steps.\r\nThere,--now look down, your path should pass the pond by that stream,\r\ndo you see? That boggy place, that is where it is marked to go; that\r\nplace has always been the same. What do you think of men who chose that\r\nway by preference,--is it likely they would do it? What should you\r\nthink of them?”\r\n\r\n“I should think they were in a great hurry, and perhaps, that it was\r\nnight,” and Bill looked down into the marshy, overgrown hollow, at a\r\nloss to understand.\r\n\r\nHer companion’s voice aroused her: “What about this grandmother of\r\nyours?” he asked abruptly.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know anything; she has been dead a long time, but I will find\r\nout if I can.”\r\n\r\n“Will you? Perhaps you think you will also find out about this\r\nmysterious path?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nBill was a painfully persistent person. It may have been that Mr.\r\nHarborough thought so, or it may have been that he still wished to keep\r\nher to enliven the tedium of the day, for he said coolly: “I will tell\r\nyou if you like. There is no path, it is true, but the way marked on\r\nyour map was taken one night by men in a hurry to reach the chapel of\r\nease further on in these grounds.”\r\n\r\n“They made a path for themselves!” Bill cried. “They were in a hurry\r\nand went the nearest way! What were they doing? Why did they want to go\r\nto the chapel?”\r\n\r\nMr. Harborough laughed at her eagerness. “My dear young lady,” he said,\r\n“I will explain if you wish, only we must really walk on. I am sorry to\r\nsay I can no longer stand an indefinite time even to discuss anything\r\nso romantic as you seem to think this tale. Let us go on,--this\r\nway. Now for the romance: to begin with, do you know a certain old\r\ntradition in connection with carrying a corpse? It may linger still,\r\nthough I hardly think it, but at the time I am speaking of it was not\r\ninfrequently believed that the way along which a body had been carried\r\nfor burial became a path for ever, became what is called a right of\r\nway. Mind, this is tradition I am telling you, not fact; it is not fact\r\nand it never was. If twenty bodies were carried through my grounds\r\nfor burial no right of way would be established, but at one time some\r\npeople firmly believed such a thing to be the case.”\r\n\r\n“Then the men were carrying a body?” Bill’s face was flushed with\r\nexcitement. “And the person who marked my map knew about it and\r\nbelieved the tradition?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. The question is, who marked your map?”\r\n\r\n“Did not many people know about carrying the body that way?”\r\n\r\n“Not many, and certainly very few could have marked your map with the\r\naccuracy with which I believe it to be marked.”\r\n\r\n“The burying was private, then?”\r\n\r\nBill was anxious to make the most of her romance. Her companion watched\r\nher eagerness with an amused face, and as they came suddenly on to\r\na gravel path, he said with an air of impenetrable mystery: “Very\r\nprivate, I should say, at that time, very private indeed.”"

      "content": "HARBOROUGH OF GURNETT.\r\n\nIt was an axiom of Polly’s that if you can’t be clever, you had better\r\nbe a fool. This, needless to state, was first said in reference to\r\nBill who, Polly considered, fell into the last category and fell there\r\ncomfortably. “Providence, or something else, helps fools,” was Polly’s\r\nopinion, “while it leaves moderately sensible people to shift for\r\nthemselves. Things always turn out right for fools. Whatever muddle\r\nBill blundered into, I believe she would blunder out of it again not\r\none bit the worse.” The day that Bill went in search of the right of\r\nway at Wood Hall was possibly an illustration of this faculty; for on\r\nthat occasion, though she had the ill-luck to blunder on the owner\r\nof the property, she was not ignominiously turned out of the place,\r\nthreatened with prosecution and other penalties; on the contrary, she\r\nwas--“Well, treated in a way in which I should not have been treated,”\r\nPolly said with an indignant sniff. Wherein she certainly spoke the\r\ntruth, but then, as Bella pointed out, Bill was not Polly; though what\r\nBill was that she should please the master of Wood Hall, neither could\r\nquite say. They did not know him.\r\n\r\nAfter all, there was not much to know, only a lonely old man who had\r\noutlived friends and health and amusements. He had come to Wood Hall\r\nto die, he said, for it was well fitting that he, the last of the\r\nfamily in a direct line, should die in the neglected home. Certainly\r\nhe had never used it much as a home; perhaps he had not cared to do\r\nso in reduced state, perhaps, more likely, he had little interest in\r\na country life. One autumn, a long time ago, he had spent a month or\r\ntwo at the old hall, which was only some five miles from the house\r\nwhere the high sheriff for the year was living. People said that\r\nthis proximity had something to do with Mr. Harborough’s visit; and\r\ncertainly there was some scandal about the sheriff’s wife which had the\r\neffect of closing the doors of the neighbouring gentry upon him for a\r\ntime, at least of those who still cherished certain provincial notions\r\nof morality. But that was all a very old tale, a tale almost forgotten\r\nnow. Miss Minchin and her compeers might recall it, but to the younger\r\ngeneration Mr. Harborough and his doings were little more than a\r\nname, for since that time Wood Hall had seen but very little of him.\r\nIndeed, he affected a cynical indifference for the old house, which\r\nwas possibly genuine enough, though it had not prevented his coming\r\nto pass his last lonely days there. Lonely they were, and tedious he\r\noften found them; tedious when he was ill, more tedious still when he\r\nwas well. It was to this tedium, and to the fact that he was moderately\r\nwell that day, that Bill owed the interest she had for him; that and,\r\nperhaps, some little charm her youth had for the old rake.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the cause, certainly she did interest him,\r\nfor when he led her through the wood and out on to the path he showed\r\nno inclination to let her go. The path was a weed-grown gravel sweep,\r\ndividing the wood on the one side from a shrubbery on the other. Here a\r\nman with a wheeled chair was waiting the arrival of his master.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” Bill exclaimed as she saw the path between the trees, “I have\r\ncome out at the wrong place! I had better go back.”\r\n\r\n“And lose your way, and trespass still further on my property?”\r\n\r\n“I will be very careful.”\r\n\r\n“I dare say.” The old man seated himself in the chair as he spoke.\r\n“Don’t you think you have trespassed enough for one day?”\r\n\r\nBill did not consider that she had exactly trespassed, but she was not\r\nsure that she could make anyone else, say a magistrate, take the same\r\nview; neither was she sure what the penalty for trespass might be, so\r\nshe only said: “I am very sorry; I thought the map was right, though I\r\ncertainly did not see a path.”\r\n\r\n“On the strength of the thought you went to look? Yes? Well, supposing\r\nI let you off this time--”\r\n\r\n“I will never do it again.”\r\n\r\n“--Let you off, I say, on a condition.”\r\n\r\n“What condition?” Bill asked cautiously.\r\n\r\n“That as a penance for coming here, you finish that song you began in\r\nthe wood.”\r\n\r\n“Is that all? I’ll certainly do that. It is not a real song, only a\r\nverse of poetry and I don’t sing it quite right. The last line should\r\nbe ‘In winter rest is sweet,’ only I like it best the other way. Shall\r\nI sing it now?” And receiving an answer in the affirmative, she sang\r\nwithout more ado:\r\n\r\n “There’s laughter for the May-time,\r\n The morning of the year;\r\n There’s work for all the day-time,\r\n When summer’s noon is here;\r\n The victor’s crown of glory\r\n The harvest home shall greet;\r\n But after life’s long story\r\n There’s the devil’s bill to meet!\r\n The devil’s bill--”\r\n\r\nshe sang till all the wood around her seemed full of laughing voices--\r\n\r\n “The devil’s bill, the devil’s bill, the devil’s bill to meet!”\r\n\r\nSeeing that the condition laid upon her was a light one she felt bound\r\nto fulfil it to the uttermost and to do her best, using all the tricks\r\nof voice and tone that she knew. In this laudable endeavour her success\r\nwas such that even the stoical attendant with the chair, who, it might\r\nhave been presumed, had outlived astonishment in his master’s service,\r\nlooked at her in surprise, while Mr. Harborough himself was delighted.\r\n\r\n“Bravo!” he exclaimed. “What a voice it is! They ought to put you on\r\nthe stage, the variety-stage.”\r\n\r\nBill was gratified, but not unduly moved. She had a tolerably clear\r\nidea that her vocal tricks had not much real value, and, as she wanted\r\nto get home, she did not care to stay for more compliments.\r\n\r\n“You see, I have got to get back to Ashelton,” so she concluded her\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n“Ashelton?” Mr. Harborough exclaimed; “you cannot get there till after\r\nthree o’clock. You surely do not mean to go fasting? You must not do\r\nthat. You will perhaps give me the pleasure of your company at lunch?\r\nYes? You had better; they will have eaten up everything by the time you\r\nget home. Come, you must not say no; that song deserves something more\r\nthan a wander in the wood. Little Miss Tucker sang for her supper,--no,\r\nfor her lunch. I promise that you shall not be late in getting home,\r\nthe carriage can take you as far as you like on your return journey.”\r\n\r\nBill was not troubled with many even rudimentary ideas of propriety.\r\nThe sandwiches were little more than a memory, and, besides,--a reason\r\nwhich influenced her most of all--if she accepted the invitation she\r\nwould see Wood Hall. Consequently she did accept and, walking beside\r\nthe chair, accompanied Mr. Harborough to the house.\r\n\r\nWhat was it like? Bill sometimes tried to describe it, but she never\r\nsucceeded, and always ended by saying: “If it were mine, I would never,\r\nnever give it up; I would fight for every brick of it, every timber,\r\nevery stone. I would sell everything to keep it; it would break my\r\nheart to let it go after it had belonged to my people for so many\r\ngenerations. It is a house that is just weighed down with years; I\r\nthink it must be almost awful to have all those years behind you.”\r\n\r\nIt was with a hushed sense of the awe belonging to a great house which\r\nhad reached its declining days that Bill entered the wide arched\r\ndoorway. She had said, as they came from the wood, how much she wanted\r\nto see the big hall of local fame, so, by Mr. Harborough’s orders,\r\nthey went by the long west front of the house. It was a great pile,\r\nbuilt of bricks which were neither purple nor red, the tint which\r\nonly the centuries can mix, with rows of mullioned windows, set not\r\ntoo straight by the hands of Tudor builders, and pressed yet more\r\naslant by the weight of time upon them. Above, was a roof high-gabled,\r\nmany-peaked, running this way and that; below, stretching to right and\r\nleft, a terraced walk led to gardens where yew hedges and pleached\r\nalleys recalled the days of hooped petticoats and powdered heads, or\r\neven of older times when the men of trunk-hose and mighty hand cast\r\nbowls on the smooth turfed green. But everywhere was decay; even the\r\nspring sunshine and the glad singing birds could not destroy the sense\r\nof death and decay,--blistered paint and lichened stone, sagging roof\r\nand darkened windows, grass on the terrace, weeds between the stones,\r\nunclipped hedges, and rose-walks a tangle of thorns; and the great,\r\nsad, grand old house looking down on it all.\r\n\r\nTo this place Bill came, out of the spring sunshine and the living air\r\ninto the great hall. It was not quite so great as tradition said, but\r\nstill of size enough to tempt some mad Harborough of bygone days to try\r\nto turn his coach in its width. Vast it was, with its dark walls hung\r\nwith tapestry rotten past repair, its polished floor, and its fireplace\r\nwhere a man might well share the hearth with the logs and not then be\r\novernear the blaze. Above the mantelpiece were the arms of the house,\r\nthe house that had seen its best days; the dragons’ heads, deep cut in\r\npolished wood, grinned down malignantly on the little intruder whom the\r\nHarborough of to-day had brought from his woods. She paused a moment,\r\nawed by the sense of past greatness, by the weight of the years that\r\nlay behind, by the thought of the stately women who had passed that way\r\nbefore her. Then she went on, and as she went her light step gained a\r\nstateliness, her figure a dignity which well became the place and made\r\nold Harborough ask himself if the child had not some good blood in her\r\nafter all.\r\n\r\nHe found himself pondering over the same question again later on, for\r\nBill, like most born mimics, often unconsciously imitated those she\r\nwas with, frequently, without being aware of it, catching her manner\r\nfrom theirs, sometimes shaping even her speech and accent according to\r\nthose of the person to whom she spoke. Thus, as Mr. Harborough treated\r\nher with an almost exaggerated courtesy, she returned him the same,\r\nand, since she was keenly conscious of the dignity belonging to the old\r\nhouse, she shaped her behaviour in accordance with it. As for her host,\r\nhe was half surprised, half amused, the amusement growing, however, as\r\nhe led her to talk. Nobody had found her conversation amusing before;\r\nCarrie and Alice, though they sometimes laughed, more often professed\r\na contempt for her and all her sayings, even while they half feared\r\nher many mocking voices. Certainly no one had laughed at her thoughts\r\nand replies; she could not herself always see a reason for her host’s\r\nlaughter, but it was plain that he did. He was old, she thought, and\r\ntherefore easily pleased, lonely and therefore not very critical; but\r\nhis appreciation encouraged her, the wine (the first she had ever\r\ntasted) excited her, and she talked as she had never talked before, he\r\nleading her on till she had bewitched herself:\r\n\r\n“I tried to amuse him a little while, poor old man,” she told Polly\r\nmeekly afterwards. “I really owed him something for the good food he\r\ngave me. Still, I think I did it more because I liked it than for\r\nanything else.”\r\n\r\nTo which Polly, having but small opinion of Bill’s powers of amusing,\r\nonly made reply, “I dare say.”\r\n\r\nMr. Harborough, however, who had lived in seclusion so long now that a\r\nsmall thing entertained him, vowed, far on in the afternoon, that Bill\r\nwas the best of good company. In acknowledgment of which compliment\r\nBill swept him a curtsey, with three fingers on her lips in the fashion\r\nof the china ladies on Miss Minchin’s mantelpiece. Then she said she\r\nmust go home, and in so saying, it is to be feared that the imp in her\r\ngot the upper hand, prompting her to the character she loved, for the\r\ntone and manner of her words suggested Mr. Johnson.\r\n\r\nCarrie and Alice did not like Bill’s mimicry, but Mr. Harborough was\r\notherwise, and he recognised the original almost before Bill was aware\r\nof it herself.\r\n\r\n“I must come and hear that parson of yours,” he laughed.\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you?” Bill suddenly became serious. “There is the Harborough\r\nchapel in Ashelton church; what is the good of having a chapel all to\r\nyourself if you never use it?”\r\n\r\n“I do not belong to the Church of England.”\r\n\r\nBill remembered Miss Minchin’s words. “Oh,” she began apologetically,\r\nbut then a magnificent idea occurred to her or to some spirit of\r\nmischief that possessed her. She cast a quick glance at Harborough, her\r\neyes ablaze with light.\r\n\r\n“What is it now?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Nothing; at least, you would not do it--I don’t believe you could.”\r\n\r\n“Try me,” he answered; “lay your commands upon me and they are obeyed.”\r\n\r\n“It is not a command; but it would be,--I should like to see what would\r\nhappen.”\r\n\r\n“In what case?”\r\n\r\n“If you had a service in your chapel. I don’t know if you could, but I\r\nshould almost think so; it is your own; you could have a Roman Catholic\r\nservice there as well as we could have a Protestant one in our part,\r\ncouldn’t you? I should like to see what would happen if you did!”\r\n\r\n“I should probably be prosecuted,” Harborough said; “that is what would\r\nmost likely happen.”\r\n\r\nBill sighed. “I never thought of that,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Did you not?” he answered. “Neither should I if I wanted the service,\r\nor rather, wanted to see what would happen.”\r\n\r\n“You would risk it?”\r\n\r\n“What will you give me if I do?”\r\n\r\nHarborough had little respect for either religion, less still for his\r\nneighbours’ feelings. As for Bill, neither thought occurred to her; the\r\nthing appealed to her as many an act, incomprehensible to a man for its\r\nfolly or its wanton mischief, appeals to the superabundant energy of\r\nboyhood. It was simply a desire to see what would happen, a sporting\r\nappreciation of an explosion with no realisation of consequences\r\npainful to other people.\r\n\r\n“What would you give me?”\r\n\r\n“What do you want?”\r\n\r\nHe hesitated a moment, and then said: “Come and see me again, and we\r\nwill talk it over.”\r\n\r\nShe agreed readily: “Yes, if Theresa will let me.”\r\n\r\n“Theresa must let you.”\r\n\r\nBill thought it was probable that she would and said so, but Mr.\r\nHarborough, possibly judging from a wider experience, was not so sure\r\nand did not seem content with the arrangement.\r\n\r\n“Why ask?” he said.\r\n\r\n“Because I must; she won’t mind.”\r\n\r\n“But supposing she does?”\r\n\r\n“She won’t; I shall be able to come.”\r\n\r\n“You think so? Then let us make this bargain: if I do as you suggest,\r\nyou will come once more to talk over the terms.”\r\n\r\n“Very well; I will come once, she is sure to let me; but when I come,\r\nsupposing I don’t like your terms, supposing they don’t seem fair to\r\nme, what am I to do? Must I fulfil them?”\r\n\r\nHe told her that she need not, laughing at her caution, as a servant\r\nannounced that the carriage was waiting.\r\n\r\nSo Bill took her leave and drove away in state, though she did not\r\nthink it necessary to complete her journey in the Harborough carriage;\r\nin fact she dismissed it at the entrance of one of the lanes and went\r\nthe rest of the way home on foot.\r\n\r\n“Did you have a nice walk?” Theresa asked her young cousin when she met\r\nher at the door.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, glorious! I have had such a good time. I went into Wood Hall,\r\nnot the grounds only, but the house too. You never saw such a place; it\r\nis,--I can’t describe it.”\r\n\r\n“Into Wood Hall!” Theresa exclaimed in astonishment.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and I saw Mr. Harborough; he was ever so kind, not the least like\r\nwhat you would expect--”\r\n\r\nAnd then out came the story of Bill’s adventures, a brief and rather\r\nincoherent story with some things left out and some told twice,\r\nand, naturally, no mention of the surprise in store for the people\r\nof Ashelton. That was the only thing she intentionally suppressed,\r\nbut unintentionally she suppressed many details and most of the\r\nconversation, though enough was told to puzzle and disturb Theresa.\r\n\r\n“Bill, I don’t know what to say. I am sure you ought not to have gone.\r\nI wish I had never let you go that walk.”\r\n\r\nTheresa, completely astonished by Bill’s tale, now for the first time\r\nrealised the responsibility of her charge. The charge herself had no\r\nidea of the nature of her offence. “Ought not to have gone?” she said.\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Because--because you ought not. I wonder you did not know; you should\r\nhave known by instinct.”\r\n\r\nTheresa’s sense of the enormity of Bill’s conduct was increasing, but\r\nwith it there was also increasing a recognition of the difficulty of\r\nmaking it clear to the offender; certainly if she depended on Bill’s\r\ninstinct she was not likely to be successful, for, as Polly had rightly\r\nsaid, Bill possessed little of that in connection with matters of\r\nsocial behaviour.\r\n\r\n“Well, for a moment I did wonder if I ought, because, of course, I had\r\non my old dress and the place is so splendid.”\r\n\r\n“That is not the reason at all. You ought not to have gone,--I mean, he\r\nshould not have asked you. He would not have done so if he had been a\r\nnice man; he could not have done so properly.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes he did--”\r\n\r\n“I mean, he could not have asked you with propriety. You know he cannot\r\nthink you--did not ask you as an equal; besides, you must have heard\r\nabout him, the sort of man he is.”\r\n\r\n“About his being bad? Miss Minchin did say that, and certainly he did\r\nsay himself that he had the devil’s bill to meet.”\r\n\r\nBill did not think it wise to explain, in answer to Theresa’s\r\nexclamation, that she herself had supplied the expression. She let that\r\npass and Theresa began: “If you thought him all that--”\r\n\r\n“But I am not sure he is bad exactly; and if he were, I don’t see what\r\nharm it would do. Besides, is he bad? Of course I shouldn’t say he\r\nwas good in our sense of the word, but then there are so many senses.\r\nHe gave me the idea of being like a person who had lost his taste for\r\nall except one kind of thing. You can’t blame a person for not liking\r\nstrawberry jam when he can only properly taste peppers; I should think,\r\nin a way, he could only taste peppers; and I should not be surprised if\r\nhe had tried them very hot.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t talk nonsense, Bill,” Theresa said severely; and Bill, acting\r\non the suggestion, did not talk at all, except when she explained to\r\nher cousin that she had promised to go to Wood Hall once again. This\r\nTheresa naturally forbade, absolutely refusing to permit it on any\r\ncondition whatever. Bill did not press the point, nor go into too many\r\ndetails, for, as she said to herself, “Perhaps he won’t do it, and\r\nthen I sha’n’t have to go after all.” If he did, it would be then time\r\nenough to settle with Theresa, and arrange some satisfactory compromise\r\nbetween breaking her own word on the one hand and her cousin’s command\r\non the other.\r\n\r\nBut would he do it? Bill wondered about it once or twice during the\r\nweek. Would he be able to get a priest to read the service for him?\r\nShe had a very vague idea as to how he would set about it. He had said\r\nsomething about knowing a man, and had smiled when he said it, not a\r\nvery nice smile, but it looked rather as if he thought the man would do\r\nas he was asked. So Bill wondered, and the week passed quietly.\r\n\r\nSunday came, a still, peaceful spring day. April was fairly in now,\r\nevery bush and tree was waking to the fact even in the grey weather.\r\nSunday was grey, quiet and calm, but a Sunday long remembered in\r\nAshelton. The congregation assembled in church at the usual time,\r\nwearing the usual clothes, for it was not yet Easter. There was nothing\r\nmuch to look at, but from force of habit the congregation looked at\r\neach other. Bill, from her corner seat, looked across the old pews to\r\nthe Harborough chapel. Was he coming? The clock began to strike eleven.\r\nNo, he was not coming after all, he--was he?--she watched. The small\r\nside door of the chapel was opened from without and into the fretted\r\ntwilight an old man stepped--he had come!\r\n\r\nA great smile of satisfaction spread over Bill’s face; a pleasant\r\nsensation of excitement and expectancy took possession of her. To\r\ntell the truth, something like a thrill of excitement ran through the\r\nwhole congregation, though they expected nothing, at least nothing\r\ndefinite. Miss Minchin said afterwards that she wondered what was going\r\nto happen when she saw him come in, but then the saying came after\r\nthe event. At the time she certainly looked earnestly enough to have\r\nseen anything there was to see, though that did not amount to a great\r\ndeal. Mr. Harborough, attended by his manservant, entered; the verger,\r\nwho hastened forward for the purpose, disposed of the servant in a\r\nside seat and shut the master in the great front pew. The congregation\r\nstared intently; Mr. Harborough stared in return with the vacant stare\r\nof a superior being,--they had always said he was very haughty; his eye\r\nmet Bill’s for a moment, and a faint smile of recognition passed over\r\nhis face, but the general public did not notice it.\r\n\r\nThe clock had ceased striking, and the first notes of the organ filled\r\nthe church with a soft vibrating sound. Forth from the new vestry on\r\nthe right came the choir and clergy; forth from the old vestry on the\r\nleft, built originally for the sole use of the Harborough chapel, came\r\na priest with shaven face set in a mask of stolid endurance. Bill,\r\nwith the wanton cruelty of youth, saw the enduring face, but, not\r\nrecognising its pain, felt no compunction, no pity for the man forced\r\nby some threat he feared to a task hateful to him. She felt nothing\r\nat all except a thrilling excitement. For a moment the event was\r\nall she had expected. All around her she could feel the mute horror\r\nand astonishment of the congregation; she could see it uncontrolled\r\non their faces, so comical, she thought, in their blank, speechless\r\namazement at this unparalleled conduct of the lord of the manor. At the\r\nend of the aisle was the verger, motionless, dumb; in their pews, the\r\nchurchwardens, alike dumb, incapable of action, watching, fascinated,\r\nthe rival clergy who, owing to the situation of the altar in the\r\nHarborough chapel, were hidden from each other’s sight by the wooden\r\nscreen. No one in the chancel knew of those in the chapel; no one in\r\nthe chapel showed any sign of knowledge of those in the chancel; all\r\nknelt in silence. But as the last choir-boy on the right rose from his\r\nknees, he leaned a little forward and saw the priest beyond the screen.\r\nHis eyes grew round with astonishment; he almost fell forward on his\r\nhead in his eagerness to be quite sure; then the situation struck him\r\nas it struck Bill, and doubled him up in spasms of suppressed laughter.\r\n\r\n“When the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness,”--Mr. Johnson\r\nbegan, at the same time becoming aware of an unusual rustle and\r\nmovement among the hitherto spell-bound people.\r\n\r\nThe priest should, no doubt, have begun to read at the same time, but\r\nhe did not. Mr. Harborough apologised to Bill afterwards for the way in\r\nwhich he failed in his part, for he hesitated and waited a moment. In\r\nthat moment the verger, a shrewd old brickmaker, hastened up the aisle,\r\nand, without waiting for orders from the churchwardens, delivered some\r\nwhispered information to Mr. Dane.\r\n\r\nThere was a breathless pause; then low but distinct came the voice of\r\nthe priest,--“_Introibo ad altare Dei_--”\r\n\r\nMiss Minchin started violently and looked about her in an awed\r\nfashion. She had seen all that had passed, but she hardly thought, as\r\nshe said afterwards, that he would really venture to hold a service\r\nin the parish church. Mr. Dane passed quietly between the slender\r\npillars of the side screen and approached the priest. A second\r\nwhispered conversation, a glance, possibly an appealing glance, at Mr.\r\nHarborough, and Mr. Dane went on to him. Mr. Johnson, in the absence\r\nof the rector, went on with the service, but when Mr. Dane returned to\r\nhis place he silenced his curate with a glance, and the priest, either\r\nmore courteous or more sure of a hearing, did not attempt to begin his\r\nreading anew.\r\n\r\nMr. Dane turned to the congregation. “My brethren,” he said, “our\r\nneighbour, Mr. Harborough, has expressed a wish to hear the mass read\r\nin his chapel of St. Mary Magdalen. As the hour he has chosen for the\r\nreading coincides with that of our morning-service, and as both cannot\r\nbe conducted simultaneously in a seemly manner, I ask you to wait with\r\nme while the reverend Father reads the mass, which may God bless both\r\nto him and his hearers.”\r\n\r\nNo one left the church; to a man they stood by their rector, though\r\nthere were those among them who had strong feelings and would have much\r\nliked to enter a protest. The priest turned back to his mass-book;\r\nhis hands shook a little, for the rector’s words had distressed him\r\ncuriously; but Mr. Dane composed himself to listen with quiet dignity.\r\n\r\nAnd deep hidden in the shadow of a high old pew was one whose grief\r\nand self-abasement knew no bounds. The event had not been what she had\r\nanticipated; things looked quite different now."

      "content": "THE COURTSHIP OF HARBOROUGH OF GURNETT.\r\n\nThere can be no doubt that few things are so well concealed as the\r\nperfectly obvious, no course of conduct so little observed as that\r\nwhich is open to all observation. If Bill had wished to conceal her\r\ndoings on Sunday afternoon she would probably have been found out;\r\nsince she was perfectly indifferent as to who knew what she did, no one\r\ndiscovered it. If she had been anxious for concealment she would have\r\ngone to the rectory by way of the field-path, and would inevitably have\r\nbeen seen by Miss Minchin and catechised by her in due season. But,\r\nsince she was far too absorbed in other matters to care what any one\r\nthought, she went by the public way and no one knew it; no one, till\r\nMr. Dane’s old housekeeper admitted her and took her to the study where\r\nMr. Dane, but lately returned from a children’s service at Ashelton\r\nEnd, sat before his beloved piano.\r\n\r\nThe rector of Ashelton knew every one in his parish and, to a certain\r\nextent, all about every one; consequently he knew of Mrs. Morton’s aunt\r\nand sister and cousins in Wrugglesby. To be sure, he knew about them\r\nbefore Theresa was Mrs. Morton, for Miss Brownlow was an institution of\r\nsuch long standing that he, being also an institution of long standing,\r\ncould hardly fail to know of her. Still, this knowledge did not give\r\nhim much information about Bill, of whom he only knew that she was a\r\nniece of Miss Brownlow and a cousin of Mrs. Morton. At one time he\r\nhad tried to find out more about her, though not from any personal\r\ninterest, for he did not know her even by sight then. It was on account\r\nof her name that he had made the enquiries, having good reason to\r\nremember the name of Alardy. However, he could discover nothing to\r\ncouple her with the other Alardy, nor indeed had he been very hopeful\r\nof discovering anything. It was the familiarity of the name that had\r\ntempted him; and it was this familiarity which caused him an almost\r\npainful start when she was announced on that Sunday afternoon. He did\r\nnot know her, nor her business, nor could he guess what it might be.\r\n\r\nBill did not leave him long in doubt; her very face betrayed her; there\r\nwas about her whole manner a contrition and self-abasement almost\r\nsuggestive of a dog in disgrace. “I have come to tell you I did it,”\r\nshe said, standing in the centre of the room; and the old rector at\r\nonce perceived that he was to hear a confession, the enormity of which\r\nseemed terrible to the offender.\r\n\r\n“Sit down,” he said kindly. “There is something you want to tell me,\r\nsomething which seems very bad? Let us hear what is the matter, and we\r\nwill see what can be done.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing can be done or undone.” She spoke with absolute conviction. “I\r\nwant to tell you in case you should blame anyone else, and because I\r\nowe it to you,--that is the reason. The thing can’t be altered now.”\r\nAnd then she plunged straight into her confession. “It is about this\r\nmorning’s service. It was all my fault; I got Mr. Harborough to have\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nMr. Dane had known the owner of Wood Hall more years than he had\r\nknown Ashelton. He was considerably surprised by Bill’s confession,\r\nconsiderably more surprised than he had been by the affair of the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n“You induced Mr. Harborough to have the mass read?” he asked. “You? But\r\nwhy?--how?”\r\n\r\n“I thought of it,” she answered, “and,--he did it. This is how it\r\nhappened. I was in the wood, and he found me and took me to the house\r\nto amuse him a little while, and I amused him as well as I could. It\r\nwas rather like the daughter of Herodias dancing before Herod, though\r\nI did not dance, he did not ask me; but I sang and talked and pleased\r\nhim. It is true he did not ask me at the end what I would like, but\r\nwhen I thought of this he half promised to do it; and now,--he has done\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“Then it was your idea? He did it to please you, or rather because you\r\nasked him?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; it was my fault; he would not have done it if it had not been for\r\nme. I suppose,” she added doubtfully, “he hardly knew what it would be.”\r\n\r\nMr. Dane had other opinions, but he only said: “Perhaps we had better\r\nnot consider his action in the matter. I have known him long enough\r\nto be tempted to judge him as one man is sometimes tempted to judge\r\nanother; but we will not do it. Let us talk about you; you persuaded\r\nhim, or at least suggested the idea?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I suggested,--I did not persuade, I only suggested; but I had\r\npleased him first so that he was ready to do as I wished; it was almost\r\nas good as persuading.”\r\n\r\nHer eyes were honest, but the rector was perplexed. He could not quite\r\nunderstand the case; the nature of the offence and the manner of the\r\ncommittal were clear enough; but the nature of the offender puzzled\r\nhim. “Tell me,” he said, “what made you suggest such a thing; why did\r\nyou do it?”\r\n\r\n“I thought it would be--” Bill hesitated for a word,--“not exactly\r\nfun, though still funny,--it was, too, at first”; and in spite of her\r\ngenuine penitence a smile stole over her face at the recollection. “I\r\nbelieve I wanted to see what would happen more than anything else,” she\r\nconcluded after a pause.\r\n\r\n“Were you satisfied with what did happen?”\r\n\r\n“No; oh, no, no! If I had thought of that I would never have suggested\r\nit; I never thought about hurting you or the poor priest. When I saw\r\nhow you took it, and how he hated what he had got to do, I felt as if\r\nI should like to get up and tell Mr. Harborough to stop. But it would\r\nhave been no use, I am sure,--I had done it and I could not undo it.”\r\n\r\n“No,” he answered her very gravely, “no, you could not.”\r\n\r\nThere was a moment’s silence, and Bill for the first time in her life\r\nfaced the irrevocable. At last the old man spoke again. “And it never\r\noccurred to you,” he said, “that it would be painful to other people?\r\nTell me, did another and a higher consideration never occur to you\r\neither?”\r\n\r\n“That it was irreverent? I did not think of it at the time; now, of\r\ncourse, I know it was; but I really did not mean to be, and I think God\r\nmust know. That is the best of it; you need never pretend or explain\r\nto Him. He knows, but other people,--I am very, very sorry.”\r\n\r\nMr. Dane pressed that point no further; perhaps the offender was\r\nbeginning to explain herself to him a little, and so he judged it\r\nunwise. He led her to talk of the events which preceded her suggestion;\r\nshe told him all readily, the walk to Gurnett, the ramble in the wood,\r\neven her own rapture when alone there.\r\n\r\n“And to think,” she concluded, “that I should have felt like that,--as\r\nif the whole world were holy--and then, a little later think of such a\r\nthing!”\r\n\r\n“I know,” he said, “I know. The human mind is a very strange thing, and\r\nevil thoughts, in spite of what some people say to the contrary, are\r\nperhaps the very strangest things which ever come there.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,”--and she drew a deep breath. “I was so glad to be alive that\r\nmorning,” she went on; “I was glad about everything; I was fairly crazy\r\nwith,--with life I think. I can’t explain, and I am afraid you don’t\r\nunderstand.”\r\n\r\nDid he not? It was a great many years ago, but he too knew what it\r\nmeant--life and the joy of living, the wanton madness of youth. He\r\nunderstood so well that he said little more about the act she deplored\r\nbut could not undo. Instead, he tried to prepare for the future, and\r\nhe prepared by asking some few questions about the past, about life\r\nat Ashelton, life at Wrugglesby with Miss Brownlow, poor dear Miss\r\nBrownlow. And again she told him readily, but her answers only deepened\r\nthe wrinkles in his forehead. She thought they were for her wrong\r\ndoings, but she confessed them all bravely, including her enjoyment of\r\nthe prayer-meeting.\r\n\r\n“I liked it,” she admitted, “because Mr. Johnson was so fine when he\r\ntalked about faith, the evidence of the spirit, and the things which\r\nare not as they are, and all the rest of it. I suppose it is wrong? I\r\nhave not imitated him very much yet; I will try not. That is the chief\r\nreason why I liked the prayer-meeting and why I went to the second\r\none. There was another reason,--I liked driving there. It was such a\r\nsplendid evening, one of those that make you feel as if you would like\r\nto live for ever.”\r\n\r\nHe ruffled his hair thoughtfully, and looked at her with a still\r\ntroubled brow.\r\n\r\n“You don’t understand?” she said, mistaking him. “I don’t mean eternal\r\nlife that we--that Mr. Johnson talks about; but never to leave the\r\nworld. It is so beautiful, so,--so dear! I can’t”--and there was almost\r\na sob in her voice--“I can’t bear to think I shall have to die and lose\r\nsight of it all; that the thrushes will sing and I shall not hear them,\r\nthe leaves come and go, the suns rise and set, and I never see them. It\r\nis sad to think how much I have lost already, though inside myself I\r\nalways feel as if I had not really lost it, as if I had been there all\r\nthe time from the beginning and seen all the changes. You know what I\r\nmean; you can learn lots about the past but nothing about the future;\r\nnothing helps you about that, and by-and-bye there will be, must be,\r\nmore earth-history--it does not seem possible that I shall not know; I\r\ndo not feel as if I could die!”\r\n\r\nShe looked up, appealing almost passionately for mercy on this first\r\ntime that her soul had been betrayed into words. Perhaps the old rector\r\nwas a lenient judge; his eyes were almost wistful as he said half to\r\nhimself: “And you are never ill, and never tired.”\r\n\r\n“I never have been.”\r\n\r\n“And you have not nearly enough to do--” he was speaking solely to\r\nhimself now--“God help you!”\r\n\r\nIt is possible Mr. Dane thought this was a case for man’s help also; at\r\nall events he did not dismiss it with some brief fatherly advice and a\r\nblessing. He talked to Bill as he had not talked before to anyone in\r\nAshelton; he, who, as it were, kept all on the outskirts of his life,\r\nspoke of those things which were the innermost shrine of his faith,\r\nthe things which, like the priests of old, he believed should be kept\r\nfor the initiated. And Bill was not initiated. Possibly she did not\r\nquite understand him; but it did not matter, she would do so some day.\r\nPossibly he did not quite understand her; how should he with all the\r\ngap of years between them? Nevertheless he treated the girlish fancies\r\ndelicately, almost as holy things.\r\n\r\nIn the end he set her a penance, for, though a believer in spiritual\r\nrepentance, he also held that work was very good for the soul; so for\r\nher wrong-doing he set her a task, at least he said it was for that.\r\n\r\n“What shall I do?” she asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n“You know that long bed at the bottom of Mrs. Morton’s garden? Dig it\r\nup. First pull up all the weeds and burn them, then dig it up, dig\r\ndeep, put in manure and plant potatoes. I do not think Mrs. Morton will\r\nobject; I fancy she would let you do what you like in her garden.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, oh yes, she won’t mind. I will begin to-morrow morning; is there\r\nnothing else? I shall like doing that.”\r\n\r\n“Do that first,” he said, and she promised, not questioning his right\r\nto set her a task nor the fitness of the one he set. In fact, so\r\nsatisfied did she seem with his wisdom that, just as she was leaving,\r\nshe told him of the promise to go to Wood Hall again and of the\r\ndifficulties attending it.\r\n\r\n“I promised,” she said, “thinking Theresa would let me go, and now she\r\nwon’t; but I must still go.”\r\n\r\n“You should not have promised;” and he looked very grave.\r\n\r\n“But I have; I thought Theresa would not mind.”\r\n\r\n“She is quite right; nevertheless one must keep a promise.”\r\n\r\nIt is to be feared that here spoke the man dowered with family\r\ntradition, and not the clergyman and spiritual adviser. The sentiment,\r\nhowever, was one which Bill understood. “Yes,” she said, “I must go.”\r\n\r\n“But not alone,” he answered; “she must go with you.”\r\n\r\nThis Bill did not understand; she was also very certain that Theresa\r\nwould not agree, and proceeded to explain the difficulty.\r\n\r\n“She would take you, surely she would drive with you?” Mr. Dane\r\npersisted.\r\n\r\nBut Bill shook her head. “She would say the promise was wrong and could\r\nnot be kept, and she would think she was encouraging wrong by going;\r\nthat is her way of looking at it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Dane felt he was brought face to face with a difficulty, but he\r\nonly repeated firmly, “You must not go alone.” Perhaps he could think\r\nof nothing else to say.\r\n\r\nFortunately just then Bill thought of a possible way out of the\r\ntrouble. “Do you think it would do if Polly were to drive with me?” she\r\nasked. “Polly is my eldest cousin. I should have to leave her outside\r\nthe house, but I would not be many minutes gone.”\r\n\r\nMr. Dane did not know Polly, but he thought she would do. He strongly\r\nrecommended also that she should, if possible, accompany Bill into the\r\nhouse. Bill was not at all sure that Polly would do this, and she was\r\nvery sure indeed that she did not want her to do it; however, she could\r\nnot explain all this to Mr. Dane in the time now at her disposal, so\r\nshe prepared to say good-bye.\r\n\r\n“There is one thing I should like to ask you before you go,” said Mr.\r\nDane, looking at her thoughtfully as she stood by his chair. “It is\r\nabout yourself.”\r\n\r\n“I will tell you if I can,” she answered, “but I think I have already\r\ntold you all there is to tell.” Indeed, she had told him a great deal,\r\nfar more than she was aware of, but it was not quite what he meant.\r\n\r\n“Your mother was Miss Brownlow’s sister?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes, the youngest, Kate; but I do not remember her at all; she died\r\nwhen I was very little.”\r\n\r\nMr. Dane looked at her thoughtfully. “I should doubt if you were like\r\nyour mother,” he said; “you are not at all like your cousins, or Miss\r\nBrownlow either.”\r\n\r\n“No, I am not like them; sometimes Polly says I am like my father; but\r\nshe did not know him, and she only says it when she is angry. I don’t\r\nthink I can be like him really, except that I am dark. He was dark, but\r\nthen he was very clever and fascinating; Auntie says he bewitched my\r\nmother, so that she would marry him in spite of what they all said. I\r\nbelieve they did not think him good enough for her. I don’t quite know\r\nwhat he was; he used to come sometimes to sing at the town where she\r\nlived, but he was not a grand professional singer. Some people said he\r\nwas half a gipsy; he loved wandering about.”\r\n\r\n“Do you remember him?”\r\n\r\n“Not clearly; he did not live long after my mother; still I remember\r\nhim better than I do her. I can just remember going about with him, or\r\nat least I think I can; it is difficult to tell which is memory and\r\nwhich fancy, it is all so long ago. I came to Auntie when I was very\r\nsmall.”\r\n\r\n“And remained there ever since?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, remained there ever since,” and she held out her hand to him.\r\n\r\nHe took it. “Good-bye,” he said, “good-bye, little maiden. Do they call\r\nyou Katie, too?”\r\n\r\n“No; Bill,--Wilhelmina.”\r\n\r\n“Wilhelmina!”\r\n\r\nPerhaps the other Alardy had been called Wilhelmina; the old man’s face\r\nalmost looked as if it were so, or as if some ghost had sprung to life\r\nat the name. But Bill did not see his face; for a moment he stood in\r\nthe shadow of the door, then turned and went stooping into the dimness\r\nof the passage; and she went onward down the road, thinking only how\r\nshe could compass to-morrow’s visit.\r\n\r\nPolly was shrewd enough after her fashion, and if she saw Mr.\r\nHarborough would, Bill felt certain, find out more than was desirable\r\nconcerning her cousin’s share in the reading of the mass. Therefore\r\nPolly must not set foot inside Wood Hall. Bill had some respect for\r\nher shrewdness, though she was depending on being able to outwit it\r\nwhen she said she would get her chaperonage for the intended call. “But\r\nI’ll get her,” Bill assured herself as she walked home that Sunday\r\nafternoon; and the chances were that she would, for she was a tenacious\r\nlittle person, and also, while much lacking in perception on some\r\npoints, she had an instinctive comprehension of character which gave\r\nher a truer conception of the turns and twists of Polly’s nature than\r\neither of the other cousins possessed.\r\n\r\nOn Monday morning Bill set to work to carry out her plan. Her newly\r\nacquired mastery over the reins was the first thing pressed into\r\nher service. She would drive the old pony over to Wrugglesby, pack\r\nsome clothes she wanted, and bring Polly (Bella would be giving\r\nmusic-lessons) home to Haylands with her for the night. At first\r\nTheresa demurred, but Robert only laughed at her fears; and finally\r\nBill was allowed to go, with Henry, the boot-boy, in attendance in case\r\nof accidents. Bill accepted Henry’s escort to Wrugglesby, but said he\r\nwould have to walk back as she intended to take Polly for a drive by\r\nherself. Theresa demurred again, but Robert was on Bill’s side; and\r\nfinally, as might have been foreseen, Henry walked back alone, while\r\nBill and Polly went for their drive.\r\n\r\nNot, however, before Bill had encountered another obstacle, which\r\npresented itself in the attractive form of Bella. Bella wanted to make\r\none of the party; she pointed out that there was room for her in the\r\npony-carriage, and that Theresa was sure not to mind an extra guest for\r\none night. Of course, in the ordinary way it would have been impossible\r\nfor her to get out in the afternoon, but to-day it happened that nearly\r\nthe whole school was going to a birthday party and there were only two\r\nmusic-lessons to give. These two lessons were Bill’s salvation: she and\r\nPolly would take their drive while Bella gave them; as soon as she had\r\ndone she was to walk to Sales Cross Roads, where they would meet her\r\nwith the pony-chaise at a quarter to four.\r\n\r\nThe plan met with Polly’s entire approval; she did not at all wish to\r\nwaste the early part of the afternoon waiting for Bella, and she was\r\nnot troubled with many unselfish scruples. When Bella inconveniently\r\nsaid, “I think I could be at Sales Cross before that,” Polly answered\r\ndecidedly, “But we cannot.” Whereupon the good-natured Bella gave way,\r\nand, with matters at last satisfactorily arranged, the other two drove\r\naway.\r\n\r\nPolly leaned back with great satisfaction; Bill had borrowed a cushion\r\nfrom Theresa for her and she appreciated it. “Really, Bill,” she said\r\nbenignly, “I should never have thought you would learn to drive so\r\nwell; you are quite getting on.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think I have grown up any more?” Bill asked.\r\n\r\nPolly looked at her thoughtfully. “I don’t think you have developed\r\nmuch,” she said, after consideration. Before she reached the end of her\r\njourney that day she changed her opinion and came to the conclusion\r\nthat Bill had developed surprisingly, in one direction at least.\r\n\r\n“We are going to Gurnett,” Bill announced, and Polly, to whom one place\r\nwas as good as another, acquiesced.\r\n\r\n“We can easily get from there to Sales Cross to meet Bella,” Bill went\r\non to explain when they were nearing the village. “I want to see some\r\none at Gurnett, or rather, just this side of it; we don’t go through\r\nthe village.”\r\n\r\n“Whom are you going to see? I will hold the reins while you go in;\r\nI don’t care about going with messages to strange farms; there are\r\nalways geese and cows about.”\r\n\r\nBill entirely agreed with this suggestion. “Yes,” she said, “you must\r\nwait outside while I go in; I won’t be long, not more than ten minutes\r\nI expect. It is not to a farm we are going, though; it is to Wood Hall.”\r\n\r\n“Wood Hall? Whatever does Theresa want from there?”\r\n\r\n“Theresa does not want anything; I am going on my own business. She\r\ndoes not know I am going, and she would be very angry if she did.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Bill!”\r\n\r\n“But I have got to go all the same,” Bill continued, ignoring the\r\nexclamation.\r\n\r\n“What about me? Pray, why should I allow it if Theresa does not? I\r\ninsist on hearing all about it at once.”\r\n\r\nCuriosity as well as indignation prompted this speech, which Bill\r\nproceeded to gratify to a certain extent. “I will tell you as much as\r\nthere is time for,” she said, and there was not time for a great deal.\r\nPolly’s explosions of righteous wrath, not so judicial and certainly\r\nnot so genuine as Theresa’s, helped to shorten the narrative.\r\n\r\n“Well, Bill, I could not have believed it of you! No, I could not, even\r\nif anyone had told me! I know a good deal about you, it is true, but I\r\nshould never have expected--well--” Words failed, and Polly took refuge\r\nin a superlatively expressive sniff; she had brought the language of\r\nsniffs to a rare perfection.\r\n\r\nBut Bill was not at all impressed, and when Polly asked with stern\r\ndignity, “Do you think I, any more than Theresa, will allow you to go\r\nto Wood Hall?” she answered, “You can’t help yourself.”\r\n\r\n“Can’t help myself, indeed!”\r\n\r\n“No, we are just there.” That was undeniably true; they were in the\r\ndrive and must soon reach the house. “If you did not mean to come,”\r\nBill went on composedly, “why did you not say so before we turned in?”\r\n\r\n“I did not notice.”\r\n\r\nBill was politely doubtful. “Look here, Polly,” she said, “what is the\r\ngood of pretending? It is not what things are that matters to you, it\r\nis how they look. I am sure that this is quite right; you are not; but\r\nthat does not count, as you only want it to look right--”\r\n\r\n“Bill! You are a wicked girl. How dare you say such things?”\r\n\r\n“I dare say them, and you dare think them,” Bill retorted, vaguely\r\naware that she must have outraged the sense of decency again. At that\r\nmoment a sharp turn in the drive showed them the house just in front,\r\nthe chaise swayed to one side, for the ground dipped suddenly down\r\nbefore it rose again for the last little ascent.\r\n\r\n“I shall come in with you,” Polly said heroically, as she gripped the\r\nsides of the chaise with a firm, though nervous, grasp. “I shall not\r\nleave you--Bill, do be careful how you drive!--not leave you in spite\r\nof your conduct to me.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you will. You will wait outside, and think how it can be made to\r\nlook best.”\r\n\r\n“I shall do nothing of the kind!”\r\n\r\n“Then I shall frighten the pony and make him run away. He won’t run\r\nfar, but by the time you get back here I shall have gone inside.\r\nGood-bye for the present; I sha’n’t be long.”\r\n\r\nBill jumped out as she spoke, and the indignant, though discreet,\r\nPolly took the reins and patiently waited in the pony-carriage. Bill\r\ncertainly had developed, and developed, among other things, a painful\r\nplainness of speech. This hurt Polly more than anything else, for\r\nshe believed in observing all the decencies of life, in saying and\r\nseeming all that was suitable to the occasion, even to a certain extent\r\npersuading herself to feel it too. She always acted, for herself if\r\nthere was no other audience; she could not help it, and the fact\r\nthat there was not the least chance of anyone being deceived did\r\nnot deter her from taking a part. More often than not people were a\r\nlittle deceived; they believed in her more or less, as she believed\r\nin herself. Bill did not, which was her misfortune; but she said so\r\nbaldly, and that was her fault, a fault Polly found it hard to forgive\r\njust then. “Yet,” Polly thought when she sat in the chaise waiting and\r\nmeditating on Bill’s development, “she is proving to be rather as I\r\nexpected; she has twenty times the go of the other two, if only one\r\ncould make her sensible.” From which it may be seen that Polly had a\r\nkeen eye to the main chance, and even in matters of personal affront\r\nsought first a possible advantage; afterwards, if expedient, she\r\nresented the annoyance. During the ten minutes that she waited for Bill\r\nshe had serious thoughts of making common cause with that offender.\r\n\r\nBill was as good as her word. Mindful of a limit to Polly’s patience,\r\nshe came to the point as soon as possible, and asked what Mr.\r\nHarborough demanded in return for fulfilling her wish. But he, not\r\naware of any urgent reason for haste, set the question aside and asked\r\ninstead if she had been satisfied with Sunday’s comedy.\r\n\r\nShe did not think it a comedy; indeed, to tell the truth, she was not\r\nquite sure what a comedy was; certainly she had not been satisfied,\r\nbut, as she hastened to explain, that was not his fault. “It was my\r\nown,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Your own, daughter of Eve? Dissatisfied as soon as gratified? It’s the\r\nway with ’em all. Still I own this affair did not turn out as well as\r\nit might.”\r\n\r\n“You did not expect it to be like that? Neither did I; if I had\r\nthought--”\r\n\r\n“You would have chosen a day when the curate was in sole command? It\r\ncertainly would have been better from a sporting point of view.”\r\n\r\nFor a moment the vision of what might have occurred in those\r\ncircumstances flitted through Bill’s mind, but she banished it and said\r\ngravely: “It would have been funnier, I dare say, but no better; worse,\r\nI think, for I should not then have found out that it was wrong.”\r\n\r\nMr. Harborough laughed, seeming to find a good deal of amusement in the\r\nidea of Bill’s tardy conscientious scruples; but on account, he said,\r\nof her disappointment he asked nothing further of her, saying that they\r\nwould now cry quits to the bargain. Bill was relieved, having been\r\nafraid he would lay some fresh difficulty upon her; as it was, she felt\r\nshe had escaped easily, and prepared to make her adieux with a light\r\nheart, explaining at the same time that, as Polly was waiting outside,\r\nshe must go at once. The idea of Polly waiting outside also seemed to\r\namuse Mr. Harborough.\r\n\r\n“Dear me, how they have been talking to you!” he said. “Bringing home\r\nthe enormity of your conduct to you with a vengeance! They won’t\r\nleave me my unsophisticated little maiden long; good women are great\r\nteachers of the ways of this wicked world.”\r\n\r\nBill scarcely understood him; still, she fancied he was insinuating\r\nsomething against her cousin whose words really had had no weight at\r\nall in determining her action. “It was not exactly Theresa’s doing,”\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\n“Not Theresa?” He laughed. “Yet you have brought a dragon, a chaperone\r\nto watch over you. You need scarcely have taken the trouble; I should\r\nhave done you no harm.”\r\n\r\n“They would not let me come alone.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder they let you come at all.”\r\n\r\n“Theresa would not; Polly could not help herself.” Bill did not explain\r\nMr. Dane’s share in the matter, and Harborough did not ask it. “When\r\nare you coming again?” was all he said.\r\n\r\n“Never.”\r\n\r\n“Never? Are you going to leave me all alone in my desolate old age?”\r\n\r\n“They won’t let me come.”\r\n\r\nThe old man’s tone had been but half serious, yet as he spoke the\r\nextreme silence of the house suddenly impressed Bill, the loneliness\r\nof the great room where they two made an oasis of humanity in a desert\r\nof shadowy memories. The polished floor stretched around her, only\r\nquivering into life when she moved and sent distorted reflections of\r\nherself along the boards; the mirrors on the wall never waking till she\r\nturned for them to cast back her brown face and ruddy hair. Away at the\r\nfar end of the room there were chairs and cabinets, but they were too\r\ndistant to reflect her on their polished wood, too far off to have any\r\nconnection with this life. They belonged to the folks who looked down\r\nfrom the walls. It was a wondrous house, a wondrous lonely house for\r\nan old man who did not care for memories, whose taste, vitiated by the\r\nhot peppers of his manhood, could not appreciate the _pot-pourri_ of\r\nthe centuries that were gone.\r\n\r\n“Could you not get someone else to come,” Bill said at last, “someone\r\nbelonging to you? You haven’t got anyone?”--he had shaken his head and\r\nshe felt the case was a bad one till a happy idea occurred to her. “Why\r\nnot pay a girl?” she said. “You could, you know; you could get one that\r\nway.”\r\n\r\n“For what would you undertake the post?”\r\n\r\nThe question was asked with all gravity, but she was not quite sure\r\nthat he was in earnest. It would be a good thing if he were, for\r\nthis was work she could do, and, since she had to earn her living,\r\nit seemed much better that she should do it in this way which fitted\r\nher small abilities. She glanced quickly at him, uncertain what to\r\nanswer. “Twenty-five pounds a year,” she said at last, at a venture,\r\nnaming a sum which seemed to her exorbitant considering his straitened\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nHe smiled a little and shook his head. “Can’t be done,” he said, and\r\nshe prepared to reduce her terms cautiously, but he explained the\r\nobstacles.\r\n\r\n“It is the aunts and cousins who are in the way, my dear; if you were\r\nalone in the world we would not quarrel as to terms.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but I could easily explain to them.”\r\n\r\nBill was confident, but Mr. Harborough reminded her of her confidence\r\nwith regard to Theresa’s permission to repeat her visit. She was forced\r\nto admit his superior knowledge there, and to allow of its possibility\r\nagain, although it seemed foolish to carry social objections into a\r\npurely commercial transaction.\r\n\r\n“Believe me,” he said, “there are no terms on which they would allow\r\nyou to enter my service, except the cover of my name.” She did not\r\nunderstand. “If the salary were a marriage settlement,” he explained,\r\n“they would permit you to take it, and, under the name of Mrs.\r\nHarborough, they would raise no objection to your accepting the post of\r\ncompanion.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of her disappointment at finding the offer not a genuine one\r\nafter all, Bill burst out laughing; laughing principally at her own\r\nstupidity in taking him seriously. Then she said: “I must go; Polly\r\nwill be tired of waiting.”\r\n\r\n“Laugh and go,” he said. “Do you laugh at Wood Hall? I could--by\r\nHeaven, it is almost worth doing!” he exclaimed with a sudden access of\r\nenergy. “There are some who would not laugh then, my little brown elf.”\r\n\r\nHe laughed himself at the idea, laughed softly with a bitter spite\r\nin his eyes. Afterwards it occurred to Bill vaguely that perhaps he\r\nreally had been in earnest, and that she was to have played a part in\r\nsome scheme of vengeance. But she never seriously thought so, and at\r\nthe time it did not appear to her as anything but a jest. As such she\r\nlaughed again so that her merriment rang in the great room; and she was\r\nstill smiling when a minute later she came out to Polly waiting in the\r\nchaise."

      "title": "CHAPTER IX.",
      "content": "“RED IS THE ROSE.”\r\n\nThe four roads which met at Sales Cross were the four which went\r\neverywhere in the district. “You can’t go anywhere without going by\r\nSales Cross,” said Bella, basing her opinion on the number of people\r\nwho had passed while she was waiting for Bill and Polly on that April\r\nafternoon. None of these travellers were mentioned by name except Mr.\r\nJack Dawson, who could hardly be said to have passed since he was still\r\nthere when the pony-chaise came in sight. He looked, too, as if he had\r\nmeant to stay some time, seeing that he had dismounted from his horse\r\nand was standing, with the bridle over his arm, so deeply absorbed in\r\nconversation that he did not notice the approaching carriage. Bella\r\nexplained later that he got down to help her free herself from the long\r\nbramble she had twisted round her ankles while gathering primroses a\r\nfew minutes earlier. From the conversation which ensued between the two\r\nelder cousins Bill gathered that Jack Dawson had had something to do\r\nwith Bella’s second Sunday afternoon at Ashelton being less dull than\r\nthe first.\r\n\r\nBut she did not listen very attentively; Polly’s eloquence had not much\r\ninterest for her, especially since, during the drive from Gurnett,\r\nshe had settled her own differences with her cousin, telling exactly\r\nwhat she pleased of the doings at Wood Hall. There had been a battle\r\nroyal during that drive conducted with a good many words, and, it is\r\nto be feared, some vigour of expression on both sides. But it had its\r\nadvantages, it was the first time that Bill and Polly had crossed\r\nswords as equals, and each understood the other the better for doing\r\nso; also it gave Polly a further indication that Bill was growing\r\nup,--“Though not in the way we should wish,” as she said to Bella with\r\nmelancholy dignity. “No, Bella,” she went on as her listener showed no\r\nsigns of distress at the news, “Bill is not a lady, and nothing will\r\never make her one.”\r\n\r\nTo which Bill agreed, adding: “I don’t believe I have got all the\r\ninstincts and so on, and I’m sure I don’t feel things the way I ought.\r\nI suppose I have got a little bad blood somewhere.”\r\n\r\n“Somewhere!” Polly’s sniff was impressive. “With your father--well! we\r\nneed say no more.”\r\n\r\n“Considering what you have already said,” replied Bill, “I think you\r\nneed not.”\r\n\r\nBella wondered what had been said, but she did not hear, for soon\r\nafterwards they reached Haylands, where Theresa declared herself\r\ndelighted to receive the two visitors instead of one. Later on, she\r\nheard of Bill’s other doings, and with them she was not so well\r\npleased. She was distressed as well as angry when she was told about\r\nthe visit to Wood Hall.\r\n\r\nPolly had been much opposed to telling her anything about it. “Leave it\r\nalone,” she counselled; “it can’t be altered now. There will only be a\r\ngreat fuss, and how shall I look for letting you go?”\r\n\r\nBut Bill disagreed. It would not be honest, she said.\r\n\r\n“None of it was honest,” retorted Polly; and certainly the part she\r\ntook upon herself was open to question, although, no doubt, it was\r\nthe one best fitting the situation. “I thought it better to let her\r\ngo to-day,”--so she concluded a most able explanation of affairs to\r\nTheresa. “You see, to-day I was with her; another day she might have\r\nbeen alone. She was certain to go, sooner or later, with or without\r\nme,--she is so dreadfully obstinate--and so I was determined that she\r\nshould go under the most favourable circumstances.”\r\n\r\nTheresa agreed, and blamed Bill severely; but Bella remarked: “You\r\nstayed outside for her good, I suppose, Polly?”\r\n\r\n“I stayed outside,” Polly replied with dignity, “because she would not\r\nlet me come in without a scene.”\r\n\r\nThe truth of this statement was obvious and effective. Indeed Polly’s\r\nmanner while at Haylands was altogether effective; more especially\r\nwhen, on their first arrival, they found Mrs. Dawson talking to\r\nTheresa on business connected with the Church Missionary Society. Mrs.\r\nDawson had the cause of missions very much at heart; she attended many\r\nmeetings and paid many visits in connection with it, with what exact\r\nresult to the cause no one knew, but doubtless it was beneficial. The\r\nprincipal results of the call on Theresa was entirely unconnected with\r\nmissions, being the postponement of Bill’s confession for half an hour\r\nand the social opportunity afforded Polly.\r\n\r\nPolly made such good use of the occasion that Mrs. Dawson, a rather\r\nimposing personage, unbent to quite a rare extent. She even hoped that\r\nMiss Hains would be able to come to her tea-party next day with her\r\ncousin, Miss Alardy. Polly regretted she could not do so, since she was\r\nunfortunately obliged to return to Wrugglesby in the morning.\r\n\r\n“And I really did regret it too,” she informed the others when they\r\nwere discussing Mrs. Dawson late that evening; “I wish I had been\r\nstaying on here.”\r\n\r\n“We could not both have gone,” said Bill, for whom the invitation had\r\nalready been accepted; “there’s only the one skirt, you know.”\r\n\r\n“It is my skirt.”\r\n\r\n“But you have lent it to Bill,” Bella said; “besides she is the\r\nyoungest, and has never been to anything yet.”\r\n\r\nPolly did not consider this a very valid argument, though, as she\r\nsaid, it really did not matter since she could not stay any longer at\r\nAshelton.\r\n\r\nIt was at bedtime that this discussion took place. Bella was to sleep\r\nwith Bill, and Polly had come into their room to brush her hair and\r\nedify them with her views on several subjects. The fact that she did so\r\nin Bill’s presence showed plainly that she recognised her as something\r\nlike an equal.\r\n\r\n“I will tell you all about the tea-party,” Bill said, feeling rather\r\ngreedy in that the festivity had fallen to her share.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but you will not be able to do as I should,” Polly answered\r\nregretfully. “I made an impression on Mrs. Dawson this afternoon; I\r\nshould go on making one if I were to see her again, a good impression.”\r\n\r\nBill laughed irreverently.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be rude, Bill.” Polly’s manner was momentarily that of an elder\r\nand teacher, but almost immediately she dropped it and returned to the\r\nterms of familiar intercourse. She at least possessed the merit of\r\nadapting herself quickly to altered circumstances and relationships.\r\n\r\n“My dear girls,” she said, sitting down in the one easy-chair the room\r\nboasted, “one has to make good impressions, one never knows when they\r\nmay be useful.”\r\n\r\n“You have no use for Mrs. Dawson,” Bella said quickly.\r\n\r\n“No, she does it to keep her hand in, for pure pleasure and practice,\r\nand because she can’t help it. She would try to make a good impression\r\non us if there were no one else.”\r\n\r\nThis was Bill’s opinion, but Polly only said, “You are a silly child,”\r\nand began to put her hair into curl-papers, and at the same time giving\r\nthe cousins her views on many things, notably on matrimony. On this\r\nsubject she had very decided opinions which she did not at all mind\r\nexpressing with a degree of frankness which shocked Bella.\r\n\r\n“You are horrid, Polly!” she exclaimed at last.\r\n\r\n“I have the courage of my opinions,” Polly retorted; “I say what others\r\nthink.”\r\n\r\n“They do not think such things.”\r\n\r\nBill, who had hitherto paid small attention to the conversation,\r\ndebated this point in her mind as she sat perched on the bed in her\r\nfavourite position. “I don’t believe people think much at all,” was her\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nPolly told her that she knew nothing about it, but, nothing daunted,\r\nshe went on to explain herself, “They don’t think; they do things\r\nbecause the things come along, do them by instinct, or impulse, or\r\nsomething; they don’t half know what will happen. I am nearly sure\r\nthey don’t think about the before and after. Nobody can see the real\r\nbeginnings and ends, and some people don’t seem able to see even a\r\nlittle bit to right and left,--I wonder why.”\r\n\r\nNeither of the elder cousins was prepared to go into the question,\r\nBella possibly because she herself belonged to the class who cannot\r\nlook before and after, Polly, certainly because she wished to discuss\r\nmore practical matters. By way of putting an end to Bill’s speculations\r\nshe introduced the topic, suggested by her previous remarks, of their\r\nown future.\r\n\r\n“Say that you, Bella,” she said, “marry money,--”\r\n\r\n“I sha’n’t do any such thing!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, well--” and then followed another exposition of Polly’s views\r\nwhich Bill lost little by not heeding. She had picked up the fairy-book\r\nwhich she had taken to bed with her a few nights ago, and had become\r\ntoo absorbed in its pages to hear what Polly said until the mention of\r\nher own name arrested her attention.\r\n\r\n“And what is to become of Bill?” said Polly, who had by this time\r\nsettled the future for the rest of them.\r\n\r\n“There is the school she could help--”\r\n\r\n“The school!” said Polly disdainfully. “What good would Bill be, what\r\ncan she do?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” the culprit answered, before Bella could speak in her\r\ndefence. “It is quite true, I should be of no use. I don’t know what I\r\ncould do, unless, perhaps, be a general servant; they are scarce now,\r\nand I can work like a steam-engine. I never get tired and I can get up\r\never so early--you should just see how I can scrub and iron, and I can\r\ncook a little too.”\r\n\r\n“You ridiculous child!” laughed Bella. “Do you suppose we should ever\r\nlet you do that?”\r\n\r\n“She might do worse,” was Polly’s opinion.\r\n\r\n“She could not do that,” Bella replied emphatically; “neither Theresa\r\nnor I would allow it. And Polly, you might as well say good-night now;\r\nwe want to go to sleep.”\r\n\r\nPolly took her candle, casting a grotesque shadow of herself and her\r\ncurl-papers on the low ceiling. “Good-night,” she said with severity.\r\n“I am glad you can sleep; I don’t find it so easy when I look forward\r\nto what must happen.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t look,” Bill called after her, “except at your candle; look at\r\nthat, and mind you don’t spill the grease.”\r\n\r\nNone the less Bill lay awake a long time, thinking not only of the\r\nfuture but also of the post which might almost have been hers that\r\nday were it not for the aunts and cousins. Also she thought of Bella\r\nand her future, and from that she mentally went to Jack Dawson, who\r\nappeared a very pleasant sort of person, and to Mrs. Dawson, who did\r\nnot, though in Bill’s opinion she was an entertaining one. At least she\r\nhad thought so when she sat meekly silent during the lady’s call that\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nOn the next day she had another opportunity of studying Mrs. Dawson,\r\nfor that was the day of the state tea-party which Polly had so deeply\r\nregretted missing. Polly and Bella had gone back to Wrugglesby, and\r\nBill was left in undisputed possession of the skirt. It was not\r\nnew, neither was it in the latest fashion, but Bill thought it very\r\nbeautiful, as she contemplated herself in her little mirror on Tuesday\r\nevening. Of course one needed the best clothes the family could\r\nmuster for such an occasion as the present; the tea-party at Grays,\r\nMrs. Dawson’s house, was really quite an important social function\r\nbesides being the first which Bill had ever attended. She was somewhat\r\nimpressed and tremendously interested by everything, the solemn\r\nmahogany grandeur of the bedroom where she and Theresa took off their\r\nwraps, the spotless whiteness of the linen covers of the stair-carpets,\r\nthe giant hat-stand by which Robert waited for them in the hall.\r\n\r\nThe drawing-room was large; the main part of the furniture dated from\r\nthe Sixties, the wonderful blue of the upholstery being unmistakably\r\nof that era. But the sundry tides of fashion that have swept through\r\nthe land since then had left a few deposits even in this conservative\r\nhouse: some peacock-feathers and a silk-covered palm-leaf, a present\r\npossibly in the decorative days; a small black table, a relic of\r\næstheticism; a rococo photograph-screen of later date,--a few such\r\nthings could be seen here and there. “They were given to her,” thought\r\nBill gazing earnestly at the immovable black-silk dignity of Mrs.\r\nDawson; “they were given by _her_.” This was Bill’s decision when her\r\neye lighted on a girl standing near the hostess. The girl was tall\r\nand muscular, turned four and twenty, athletically built, and dressed\r\nin the fashion of the day, the fashion which obtains in Ealing and\r\nsimilar exclusive suburbs. Her face, it is true, did not express much,\r\nbut then other people’s faces do not as a rule express much, and she\r\nnaturally did not wish to do anything but what everyone else did. She\r\nwas doubtless an expert at lawn-tennis and hockey, and an authority\r\non the technique of golf. Probably she thought her aunt at Ashelton\r\nmuch behind the times, though, as she informed her friends, she liked\r\nstaying with her: “It was such a deliciously unsophisticated place\r\nstill.”\r\n\r\nBill looked at her with interest and at first with some admiration,\r\nfor to her inexperienced eyes Miss Gladys Dawson was a new and fine\r\nspecimen of humanity. Miss Gladys Dawson looked at Bill only with a\r\ncareless curiosity, she found her a little odd, and wondered why she\r\nhad never seen her at Ashelton before. She also (and here came in the\r\ninsult) looked at the skirt. A light blazed up in Bill’s eyes, a light\r\nthat was almost like a red flame, and there rose in her heart a great\r\nwrath and a feminine desire to pay back the offence, to criticise\r\nin some way the offender and bring ridicule on her. Bill had never\r\nfelt the sentiment before, being in the main indifferent to opinions\r\nof all sorts. Miss Dawson’s glance on herself would have passed\r\nunnoticed; she cared nothing for criticism and had a very poor opinion\r\nof herself,--but the skirt was another matter, Polly’s cherished\r\nskirt which she had made with so much labour out of two old silk\r\ndresses of Miss Brownlow’s! Bill felt that the look, half amused, half\r\nsupercilious, wholly, indescribably feminine in its critical survey,\r\nwas an insult to the absent Polly and cried aloud for vengeance. “I\r\nwish I could do something,” she thought vindictively. “I wonder what\r\nshe would mind most.”\r\n\r\nIt was now six o’clock, and there was a general move to the dining-room\r\nfor tea. Mrs. Dawson had always dined at two and taken tea at six, and\r\nshe always would do so as long as she was able to dine and take tea\r\nat all. She made no difference for visitors, except in the quantity\r\nof food prepared, and in that respect she certainly planned lavishly.\r\nThe table that night was loaded with the dainties which have gone out\r\nof fashion with six o’clock teas. Bill noticed everything carefully,\r\ntrying to remember all she could for the sake of her absent cousins.\r\nThere was a wonderful table-cloth, she observed, of fine unbleached\r\nlinen whereon drab dogs hunted drab stags over a greyish ground much\r\ninterspersed with drab trees whose leafy branches met in the centre\r\nof the table and were hidden under the pot of a pink azalea. Arranged\r\neverywhere, almost crowding each other off, were cakes both hot and\r\ncold, so many of them that Bill could not taste them all. There were\r\nalso several preserves, notably one of pineapple, very sticky, very\r\ndifficult of manipulation, inspiring one (if that one were Bill) with a\r\ndesire to take the pot and a spoon to the store-room and eat in comfort\r\nunobserved. “It wants practice,” Bill decided as she watched the ease\r\nwith which Mr. Johnson, who might reasonably be expected to have had\r\npractice, managed the pineapple. “I expect he has been here heaps of\r\ntimes before,” she thought, and no doubt she was right for he seemed\r\nmuch at his ease. Mr. Perry, on the other hand, was never quite able to\r\nforget the grocer’s shop when he sat down with Mrs. Dawson; he talked\r\nnervously and rapidly all through the meal, forgetting his tea in his\r\nanxiety to be polite, and remembering that he wanted a third cup when\r\neveryone had finished and the tea-pot was dry. Bill felt sorry for Mrs.\r\nDawson when she saw her pouring tepid water through the tea-pot so as\r\nto supply the late comer, sorrier still for Mr. Perry when he received\r\nhis large shallow cup and made manful efforts to drink its contents\r\nwhile the guests waited for him.\r\n\r\nBill sat next to Mrs. Johnson, a placid matron, not much given to\r\ngeneral conversation; and as she returned becoming answers to the few\r\nremarks made to her, she was voted by her neighbour to be “a nicely\r\nbrought-up girl.” Gladys Dawson, of course, was different; being\r\nolder, and “from London,” she was expected to talk, and she did do so;\r\nin fact she took the lion’s share of the entertainment upon herself.\r\nMrs. Dawson was not averse to this, but, as Bill noticed, neither was\r\nGladys. “She likes it,” thought the silent watcher; and there came into\r\nBill’s mind, by reason of the insult offered to Polly’s skirt, a desire\r\nwhich is a natural instinct in most of her more developed sisters,--the\r\ndesire to outshine the other woman.\r\n\r\n“It would not be easy,” Bill thought, feeling that she did not know\r\nmuch about the subjects of greatest interest to the ladies present;\r\nbut then, as she soon found, Miss Dawson did not either, and so wisely\r\nconfined herself to entertaining the men. Bill did not feel very\r\nhopeful of her own powers in that direction, and before she could\r\nmake any definite plans her thoughts were interrupted by Mr. Dane’s\r\nentrance into the drawing-room to which everyone had now returned.\r\nMr. Dane never joined these parties till after tea, on the excuse of\r\nparish-work. After the little disturbance created by his entrance had\r\nsubsided, and he had shaken hands with everybody, Bill found that he\r\nhad taken the chair next to her. She knew that he wanted to hear if\r\nshe had been to Wood Hall, and she was quite ready to tell him. It was\r\neasy enough to do this unnoticed in the buzz of general conversation;\r\nand accordingly she told him how she and Polly had driven to Wood\r\nHall, how Polly had waited outside, and how Mr. Harborough had laid\r\nno fresh conditions upon her. This was all very well, but it was not\r\nso well when she went on to talk of Mr. Harborough’s loneliness, and\r\nso, incidentally, of her suggestion of a paid companion, and his offer\r\nof the post to herself. “Of course he did not mean it really,” she\r\nconcluded; “it was only in fun, but for a moment I thought he meant\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“What made you think he did not mean it?”\r\n\r\n“What he said afterwards;” and she related all that followed. “He meant\r\nhe would have to marry me before they would let me come,” she said,\r\nlaughing a little.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Dane did not laugh. “Yes, marry him,” he said, “marry him for\r\nWood Hall, for his name and position,--would you do that?”\r\n\r\n“I did not have the chance; he did not ask me really; it was all fun.”\r\n\r\n“Have you told your cousins of the fun?”\r\n\r\nThe old man was looking earnestly at her, waiting for her answer, and\r\nshe hesitated before she gave it. She plainly heard Mrs. Perry saying,\r\n“I never had a sitting of eggs from the Possets turn out badly,” before\r\nshe said, “No, I have not told them.” And she wondered why she had not,\r\nand why she never would, for she knew then that she never would.\r\n\r\n“If he had meant it, would you have taken him and Wood Hall and the\r\nname, and the little you know, and the infinitely more which you do not\r\nknow?”\r\n\r\n“No,” she answered frankly. “I would like Wood Hall immensely; I would\r\ndo a good deal for a place like that--I don’t believe I would be too\r\nparticular what; but I could not marry him. I could not marry anyone; I\r\ncould not possibly be cooped up with one person. I believe I would like\r\nmore than anything else to be a gipsy and wander from place to place,\r\nmending chairs and stealing fowls.”\r\n\r\nMr. Dane did not reprove the lax morality of this speech; all he said\r\nwas: “Then I suppose you are never going to see Mr. Harborough again?”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered Bill, and as she did so Mr. Johnson, who had caught\r\nthe name, tried to draw his rector into a discussion of Sunday’s\r\nenormities. But Mr. Dane would not be drawn; he was polite, but firm\r\nand most uncommunicative. The only opinion he would give was that he\r\nbelieved Mr. Harborough’s proceedings were not actionable, since he\r\nhimself had given consent for the mass to be finished.\r\n\r\n“But I am sure we could prosecute,” Mr. Johnson persisted. “I was\r\nspeaking to Stevens,--Stevens of Wrugglesby you know--about it; he\r\nsays it is quite possible to prosecute for brawling and creating a\r\ndisturbance in church during divine service, if for nothing else.”\r\n\r\n“No doubt he is right, but I do not think the churchwardens will wish\r\nto prosecute. The case would offer several nice points to a lawyer,\r\nfor, though the mass was begun without our permission, and so was\r\ntechnically a disturbance, the offence was partly condoned by the\r\npermission to continue which was afterwards given. Moreover, though\r\nour church is of course a church of England as by law established,\r\nthe Harborough chapel is held on a very old tenure which it would be\r\nnecessary to understand clearly before any move could be made in the\r\nmatter. I don’t mean to say we could not prosecute: I dare say we\r\ncould; but I hardly think it is necessary. What do you think?”\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson almost thought it was, on account of the precedent: “Solely\r\non account of the precedent; it might occur again.”\r\n\r\n“I do not think it will,” Mr. Dane answered, just in time to prevent\r\nBill declaring the same thing warmly. Then someone began to sing and\r\nthey all listened, placidly or otherwise according to their natures.\r\nWhen the song was over, Bill, finding Mr. Johnson’s attention diverted\r\nelsewhere, turned to her neighbour for information on a subject which\r\nhad puzzled her since her first visit to Wood Hall.\r\n\r\n“You know all about this part of the country,” she said. “Perhaps you\r\ncan tell me if it is true that a good many years ago a body was carried\r\nby night from Corbycroft to the little church in Wood Hall park.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, certainly it is true; but what makes you ask? Who has told you of\r\nit?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Harborough, but he did not say much; is it a secret?”\r\n\r\n“No, oh no; some of the old folks at Gurnett still tell the tale,\r\nthough there are not many now who can tell much except from hearsay.\r\nIt was not much talked about at the time, and is pretty well forgotten\r\nnow.”\r\n\r\nHe spoke as if the subject had long lost its interest for him, but to\r\nBill it was all fresh; she felt that her romance was becoming exciting\r\nagain. “Who was it?” she asked. “Who were they going to bury?”\r\n\r\n“Roger Corby, the old Squire he was called, though he was not squire\r\nof Gurnett. He died at Corbycroft, and he died very much in debt. His\r\nservants and--and some other people believed that his body would,\r\naccording to a barbarous old practice, be arrested for debt, so they\r\nremoved it by night to the church in Wood Hall park.”\r\n\r\n“And was it arrested?”\r\n\r\n“No, and I do not believe there was any likelihood that it would have\r\nbeen. Long ago bodies were sometimes arrested, legally or illegally,--I\r\ndo not know which--but so late as that--it was in 1833--it was more\r\nthan improbable.”\r\n\r\n“But they must have believed it,” Bill objected; “they must have\r\nthought it would happen.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but the servants were ignorant, and the girl, the Squire’s\r\ngranddaughter, was a child of thirteen, headstrong, daring,\r\nimaginative; she heard the servants’ chatter and believed it. The thing\r\nwas practically her doing. She was fond of her grandfather, and there\r\nwas no one to take charge at his death; her father was abroad and she\r\nand the old butler managed everything. She always did as she liked, and\r\ngrew up as she pleased, with no one to thwart her.”\r\n\r\nBill wondered if Mr. Dane had known the granddaughter, or if this too\r\nwas only part of the local tale; she would have liked to ask him but\r\nthought that perhaps she ought not, as the last words scarcely seemed\r\naddressed to her. She contented herself with inquiring, “Did you live\r\nhere then?”\r\n\r\n“No,” he roused himself with an effort. “No; I was not born in this\r\npart of the country and at that time I was a lad at school; a little\r\nlad I must have been, for I am younger than Harborough.”\r\n\r\n“And he? Did he know at the time? How old was he then?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, he knew; he must have known, for he was at home when the thing\r\nhappened.”\r\n\r\nThere were more questions Bill wanted to ask, but she was not able to\r\ndo so for at that moment Miss Dawson’s well-trained soprano informed\r\nthe company that she was “a monkey on a stick.”\r\n\r\nBy the time she had reached the end of her song Mr. Perry had claimed\r\nthe rector’s attention, and Bill was left to meditate on the half-told\r\nstory until Mrs. Dawson asked her with awful politeness for a little\r\nmusic. Theresa had warned her that this would occur, telling her to\r\nbring her music in anticipation. Bill had obediently brought it,\r\nmaking up her mind to play one of her pieces if required, but now when\r\nthe time came she did no such thing. She cast a quick glance at Miss\r\nDawson, who was now talking to Gilchrist Harborough, and thinking\r\nof the covert sneer at Polly’s skirt, went to the piano in no very\r\nChristian frame of mind. “I can sing as well as you,” was the defiance\r\nshe mentally hurled at the young lady as she sat down to the piano and\r\nbegan to play from memory, or, more correctly speaking, by ear from\r\nsome half forgotten melody. It was curious music, at first compelling\r\nattention by its strangeness, afterwards holding it by a charm of its\r\nown,--a love-song of long ago, low, yet with an almost harsh refrain\r\nin it, vibrating with a passion at first suppressed, but afterwards\r\nbreaking forth into a tumult of emotion likely to tingle strangely in\r\nthe nerves of those who listened.\r\n\r\n “Red is the rose thou hast bound in thy hair,\r\n Redder thy lips, love.\r\n Soft is thy breath, aye, the sweetest of air,\r\n Incense to me, love;\r\n E’en though it choketh the voice of my prayer,\r\n (I pray not now, love.)\r\n Stars are thine eyes,--ill stars some declare,\r\n Beacons to me, love.\r\n Oh, heart of my heart, I want nought but thy beauty,\r\n Of here and hereafter, I ask only thee!\r\n Sinner or saint, thou art God of my worship,\r\n In time and eternity Heaven to me!”\r\n\r\nSilently Mr. Dane rose and went out of the room, closing the door\r\nnoiselessly after him. At the time Bill’s astonished audience hardly\r\nnoticed it; afterwards it was said by some of the more severe that he\r\nwent out to mark his disapproval of the tone and tenor of the song,\r\nwhich was certainly most unbecoming in a young girl. This may have been\r\nthe case; it obviously was not because his Christian forbearance and\r\ncourtesy were tried beyond endurance, as sometimes happened, by false\r\nnotes, for to a musician the rendering of this song left little to\r\nbe desired. Whatever the reason, Mr. Dane left the drawing-room, and\r\npassing through the hall went out by the open garden-door, out into the\r\nsweet spring night where the song could not reach him. His lips moved\r\nonce as he went:\r\n\r\n “If God in His anger hath shut thee from Heaven,\r\n Then closed on us both let its golden gates be.”\r\n\r\nAnd the strange thing was that these words did not occur in the first\r\npart of the song which he had heard, but in the second part which he\r\ndid not hear, and of which Bill was now singing the last verses.\r\n\r\n “Dark is the future, dark as despair,\r\n Dark as thine eyes, love.\r\n Cursed is our troth--for curse dost thou care?\r\n Curse of the church, love?\r\n Death and dishonour, e’en both we must dare,\r\n Fearest with me, love?\r\n Fearest to love me? Yet still thou’ll not tear\r\n Thyself from my heart, love.\r\n Now and henceforward, forever thou’rt there,\r\n Nor can’st thou go, love.\r\n Oh, soul of my soul, if damned is thy beauty,\r\n Then damned be my spirit forever with thee!\r\n If God in His anger hath shut thee from Heaven,\r\n Then closed on us both let its golden gates be!\r\n For thou, oh, beloved, art the God of my worship,\r\n In time and eternity Heaven to me!”\r\n\r\nAnd between the box-edged borders, where drooping daffodils glimmered\r\nin the moonlight, an old man stood and murmured in the ghostly,\r\ntearless upheaval of some dead passion:\r\n\r\n “Thou, oh beloved, art the God of my worship,\r\n In time and eternity Heaven to me!”"

      "content": "IN THE GARDEN.\r\n\nDoubtless the ladies of Ashelton were right in saying that the song\r\nsung by Bill Alardy at Mrs. Dawson’s tea-party was most unsuitable and\r\nhighly improper. It was not only the words, though, as was pointed\r\nout, they were reprehensible, but also the terrible earnestness with\r\nwhich they were sung. Ashelton was justly shocked, and Theresa,\r\nalthough agreeably surprised by the unexpected richness of her cousin’s\r\nvoice, was overcome with shame. Even Gladys Dawson, who was naturally\r\nbeyond old-fashioned prejudices, looked at Bill with something more\r\nintelligent than her previous stare. Gilchrist Harborough, sitting by\r\nMiss Dawson, remembered the words spoken by Morton that Thursday night;\r\nthe “little girl” certainly could “sing a capital song” of a sort.\r\n\r\nBut he did not remark on it to Miss Dawson; indeed he seemed to have\r\nforgotten all about her, and looked across to the singer, who had\r\ntwisted round on the piano-stool and now sat uneasily regarding the\r\ncompany with a comical mixture of fear and defiance in her eyes. She\r\nwas painfully conscious of their feelings, though not entirely able\r\nto understand them. She was both surprised and angry at the unexpected\r\nstorm she had raised. Her eyes met Harborough’s; he at any rate was\r\nnot shocked; he understood, he was even a little amused. Bill’s face\r\nbegan to clear, and the tantalising chameleon eyes changed. Miss Dawson\r\naddressed a remark to the young man, and receiving no reply, glanced in\r\nthe direction where his interest obviously lay. Bill saw the glance and\r\nexperienced a two-fold gratification; one person in the room sided with\r\nher, and another (she who had sneered at Polly’s skirt!) was annoyed\r\nthereby. Her face cleared entirely, and her eyes absolutely shone. The\r\nmischief was done.\r\n\r\nSomehow or other, Bill did not quite know how, she found herself soon\r\nafterwards talking to Harborough, about the song and about all manner\r\nof other things. It was quite easy to talk to him, though he seemed a\r\ngrave sort of young man given to taking things seriously, so seriously\r\nthat it was rather strange he should approve of the song. He asked her\r\nwhere she had learned to sing it, and she told him she did not quite\r\nknow. “I found the verses written out,” she said, “and I think I must\r\nhave heard them sung when I was young. Perhaps my father sang them; I\r\ndon’t know.”\r\n\r\n“You sang as if you meant it,” he observed.\r\n\r\n“So they should be sung.”\r\n\r\n“But you have not felt that; you don’t know what you were talking\r\nabout.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no,” she agreed readily, “it is all pretending; but that does not\r\nmatter; one can pretend anything. Almost it feels sometimes,” she went\r\non thoughtfully, “as if one had felt it in another first life; don’t\r\nyou think so? Or perhaps it is that those who went before--the mothers\r\nand fathers and grandfathers--felt it and passed the memory on.”\r\n\r\nHarborough shrugged his shoulders. “That is an old problem,” he said,\r\n“which does not trouble me much. I never think about my ancestry as you\r\nseem to; I find enough to do without seeking for the grip of the dead\r\nhand.”\r\n\r\n“Some people do not have to seek for it,” Bill answered. She was\r\nthinking of the Harboroughs of Gurnett. “Have you ever been to Wood\r\nHall?” she asked abruptly.\r\n\r\n“No; I have ridden past it once or twice, but I have not had occasion\r\nto go in that direction often,--why?”\r\n\r\n“You know there are Harboroughs there,--people of your name?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, possibly distant connections; I have heard my father say that\r\nhis people came originally from this part of the country. But I am not\r\nproud of the fact, if it is one; they appear to have been a pretty bad\r\nlot.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Bill admitted, “and they are poor, desperately poor for the\r\nposition: at least, so it is said, and certainly the place looks like\r\nit. Still they have been there for hundreds of years.”\r\n\r\n“What the better are they for that? Nothing, I should say, seeing that\r\neach generation seems to have been worse than the previous one, till we\r\ncome to the present, last and worst, bankrupt alike in means, morals\r\nand constitution, played out, worn out, done for,--and a good thing\r\ntoo.”\r\n\r\n“It is the grip of the dead hand,” Bill said with conviction, and when\r\nhe looked at her, doubtful as to her meaning, she explained: “They have\r\nan awful lot against them; the fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the\r\nchildren have not much choice left them.”\r\n\r\n“Much income, you mean.”\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t, though they have not very much of that either. I believe\r\nthe estate is mortgaged, but so are their natures and characters; they\r\ncould hardly go straight if they would. Think what it must be to have\r\nall that weight of tradition and fathers’ sins pulling against you.”\r\n\r\nHarborough was not convinced. “Most of us have as many ancestors as\r\nhave the great people of Gurnett,” he said, “yet some of us seem\r\ncapable of independent action.”\r\n\r\n“We don’t know about them; that makes a difference. We have not got\r\nthem, in a way, stored up as the Harboroughs have. If you had been into\r\nWood Hall you would know what I mean.”\r\n\r\n“Then you think the next Harborough is bound to go and do likewise?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know him,” Bill said; “but I think he has a bigger chance of\r\ndoing likewise than you have.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; because if I believed I was doomed to be the same kind of\r\nblackguard as my ancestors I should blow my brains out.”\r\n\r\nBill looked at him gravely. “You wouldn’t really,” she said; “because\r\nyou would not be as you are now if you were one of them. I wonder how\r\nnearly you are related?”\r\n\r\n“What does it matter?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing,--unless you could claim Wood Hall.”\r\n\r\n“I am generations away from that,” he laughed; “and I don’t want to be\r\nany nearer.”\r\n\r\n“You are not a Catholic? No? I wonder if the owner of Wood Hall must\r\nbe?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not; a man’s conscience is his own.”\r\n\r\nBill nodded. “And his family?” she said.\r\n\r\n“Have nothing to do with it; a man has a right to his own opinion.”\r\n\r\nHarborough spoke warmly: he almost looked as if he defied Bill to\r\ndefend the position; but she only said: “A woman is better off then;\r\nshe has a right to two opinions,--her own and that of the person she is\r\nwith.”\r\n\r\n“That is scarcely the point,” Harborough said; but he did not get her\r\nback to the point, for she would have no more serious discussion;\r\neither her ability or her interest was exhausted. Harborough, whose\r\nbent of mind was habitually grave, tried in vain to bring the\r\nconversation back, and was half amused, half vexed by her evasions.\r\nHe was certainly wholly vexed when Miss Dawson, from the ottoman,\r\nintroduced the labour-problem as a subject likely to interest him.\r\n\r\nBill perceived the vexation and was amused. If she had been truly\r\nfeminine she would probably have been gratified; but her nature was\r\nlacking in some of these girlish characteristics, and though she was\r\npleased by the annoyance of Gladys, her enjoyment partook more of the\r\npleasure of vengeance than of a womanly appreciation of pre-eminence.\r\nShe was glad to have avenged the insult offered to Polly’s skirt, but\r\nshe had no other feeling about it. She certainly never thought of\r\nGilchrist; by the next morning, when she set about her penance in the\r\ngarden, she had forgotten all about him.\r\n\r\nShe enjoyed the penance immensely. It was hard work in the open air\r\nand there was something to show for the labour; moreover, it appealed\r\nstrongly to her, for it was a clearing up and setting straight with\r\nthe prospect eventually of a productive yield. She had already made\r\nplans for the improvement of other parts of the garden when the long\r\nbed should be finished. There was plenty of room for improvement, for\r\nthe garden seemed to be nobody’s business; Robert was not interested in\r\nit, and Theresa,--more because she had never been used to doing so than\r\nfor any other reason--never thought of working in it.\r\n\r\n“She does not like digging and she hates worms,” Bill said. “You would\r\nnot expect T. to grub out here; besides, she has work in the house.”\r\n\r\nThis was said to Gilchrist, who apparently had not entirely forgotten\r\nher existence, whatever she may have done with regard to his. At all\r\nevents, when he saw her from the footpath which crossed the field\r\nbeyond the garden, he came to enquire how she was and what she was\r\ndoing. She told him her intentions with regard to the plot of ground on\r\nwhich she was engaged, but she did not cease work to do so.\r\n\r\nHe watched her half amused. “I wonder Morton did not set one of the men\r\nto dig this for you,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Why should he? I can do it well enough.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he admitted, “but it is hard work for you.”\r\n\r\n“Work,” she replied oracularly, “is an excellent thing. You yourself\r\nbelieve in the dignity of labour.”\r\n\r\n“Who told you that?” he asked reddening slightly.\r\n\r\nShe had stooped down and was wrestling with a giant worm as yet but\r\nhalf above the soil. “Don’t you believe it?” she inquired. “Out you\r\ncome--” this was addressed to the worm--“you’re not going to stop here,\r\ncome along now!” It came, and she threw it over the iron fence to find\r\na new home in the field. “This is the dignity of labour,” she said as\r\nshe returned to her work.\r\n\r\nThere was very little dignity about the small, hatless figure on the\r\ndeeply dug plot. Bill had a great faculty for putting trade-marks of\r\nher occupation on herself and clothes; labour she might represent, but\r\ndignity never.\r\n\r\nHarborough laughed a little; it was impossible to know when the girl\r\nwas in fun and when in earnest. “Mrs. Morton will have a lot of\r\npotatoes if your crop is a good one,” he observed.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but they’ll keep,--besides, she can bring them to Wrugglesby for\r\nus if she likes. There is an awful lot of waste in this garden; one\r\ncould grow heaps of things--it does seem a pity. While I am here I am\r\ngoing to try what can be done with it.”\r\n\r\n“In the way of growing potatoes?”\r\n\r\n“All manner of things. I don’t know much about it, but I’ll find out;\r\nthere is a book about gardening here, and Mr. Dane has got another, a\r\nbig one, I saw it in his bookshelf. I expect you know a good lot.”\r\n\r\nShe stopped work for a moment as the idea occurred to her, then went on\r\nagain with it and her questions at the same time till Harborough soon\r\nfound himself giving information on the subject of fruit and vegetable\r\nculture; flowers did not seem to enter into the girl’s consideration at\r\nall.\r\n\r\n“Some grow themselves,” she said of them, “and there are heaps of wild\r\nones to be got. I would see about flowers afterwards; the other things\r\nmust come first.”\r\n\r\n“But,” Harborough objected, “in such a garden as this it would be\r\npossible to grow many more eatables than Mrs. Morton could use; surely\r\nit would be better to devote the surplus time and room to flowers.\r\nUnless,” he added slily, “you think the other vegetables could be\r\nbrought to Wrugglesby like the potatoes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, yes,” Bill admitted, “some could, and the rest could be sold.”\r\n\r\n“To whom? Believe me there is no profit attached to market-gardening on\r\na small scale; your profits would not pay your freight to London.”\r\n\r\n“I should not send them to London.” Bill was at the end of the row now,\r\nand Harborough had moved farther along the fence to keep even with her.\r\n“I should take some in the light cart to Wrugglesby and sell to people\r\nwho had no gardens, and some I should take to Darvel. It is rather a\r\nlong distance off, but it is quite a big town with barracks and lots of\r\nhouses without gardens. People with things to sell come to our house\r\nin Wrugglesby like that; at first we did not buy much, but now we have\r\na good deal from them--that is how it would be with me. I should sell\r\nrabbits too, I think, and fowls and eggs; Theresa does not half make\r\nthem pay.”\r\n\r\n“I fancy she would raise objections to your making them pay in that\r\nway.”\r\n\r\nBill was forced to admit that such a thing was probable. “Still,” she\r\nsaid, “if it was really right I might do it all the same if I lived\r\nhere; I could easily get round Robert. But I don’t live here, so I am\r\nafraid there is an end of the matter.”\r\n\r\nHarborough watched her curiously for a moment. “You don’t appear to\r\nsuffer from any class-prejudices,” he observed.\r\n\r\n“What are they? Do you mean I don’t mind what I do? If that is it, I\r\ndon’t; why should I? Do you?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\nThe question was superfluous, he thought, for did not his manner of\r\nliving demonstrate his theory to Bill as to everyone else?\r\n\r\n“You work your own farm,” she said, so she evidently knew, “and I\r\nshould work my own cabbage garden. We should not make big profits, but\r\nwe should make enough to live on with what we grew for ourselves, and\r\nwe should enjoy ourselves at the same time.”\r\n\r\n“You would like it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, very much. I do not mean I should do it if I were rich. I should\r\nfind some other work then; there is sure to be some belonging to being\r\nrich; but if I were not rich, only rich enough to have a farm or a\r\ncabbage garden, I should work them like that.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder if you know what real work is?”\r\n\r\nThe remark was more speculation than question, and seemed to emanate\r\nfrom a different and much older being. Bill was not piqued, for indeed\r\nshe regarded him in the light of a different and older being.\r\n\r\n“I have not done much,” she said, “but I mean to get this garden a\r\nlittle straight before I go back to Wrugglesby.”\r\n\r\n“If you don’t get tired of it first.”\r\n\r\n“I sha’n’t do that; you can come every morning if you like, to see if I\r\nam at work or not.”\r\n\r\nThis was something of a challenge. Harborough at first had not intended\r\naccepting it, yet, since on the next day circumstances caused him to\r\ncome home at mid-day by the field-path, he thought he might as well see\r\nif the girl was really at work. The day was moist and close, and a warm\r\nfine rain, which fell at intervals, might have offered some excuse for\r\nremaining indoors. But she had not availed herself of the excuse; very\r\nlikely, he thought, because she expected he would come, thinking which\r\nhe wished he had not done so, and even for a moment meditated going\r\naway without betraying his presence. But it was too late for that; she\r\nhad seen him and glanced up from her work to ask, “Are you going to\r\nmarket this afternoon?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose you can’t see Robert off in good time? Theresa will be\r\nwaiting for him.”\r\n\r\n“I will do what I can.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you.” She resumed her work, and he went on his way determined to\r\nkeep his promise.\r\n\r\nAnd either he did keep it, or else some other circumstance brought\r\nabout the desired results, for Robert came home early that night; and\r\nBill, who was sitting with Theresa, was satisfied, trying to persuade\r\nherself that Harborough was right in saying that the one escapade was\r\nan accident not likely to be repeated.\r\n\r\nShe did not see Harborough for the next few days, and so could not\r\nthank him for his good offices. She did not altogether expect to see\r\nhim; indeed, to tell the truth, she had forgotten about him in the\r\nengrossing interest of her work. But after nearly a week he passed\r\nthat way again and found her still very busy, though now at a spot\r\nsome little way from the railing. She did not cease work to come to\r\nhim, and as he did not jump the rail to come to her, they carried on\r\ntheir conversation in tones suitable to the distance that separated\r\nthem,--an arrangement which struck Harborough as more practical than\r\npleasant, though he would not take the initiative in improving upon\r\nit. The conversation itself was practical, strictly horticultural, and\r\nmostly concerned with the growing of lettuces, which, though it showed\r\na laudable attention to business on Bill’s part, was uninteresting. She\r\nwas attending very much to business and not very much to Harborough;\r\nshe even once went unceremoniously away to fetch some water-cans,\r\nsinging as she went.\r\n\r\nHarborough turned to go; the water-cans, it is true, were not far\r\naway, but she had gone for them without a word of apology. He was an\r\nextremely practical young man, believing in utility, in the importance\r\nof work above all things; but he did not quite appreciate seeing\r\nmanners (and himself) sacrificed to some one else’s notion of work.\r\n\r\n“‘There’s work for all the day-time,’” Bill sang, repeating to herself\r\nfragments of the song she had sung to the other Harborough, and quite\r\nunconscious of having offended this one. “The rose of this can has\r\nrather big holes in it; I believe it will wash the seeds out of the\r\nground--‘the victor’s crown of glory,--of glory, glory’--now, then, I\r\nhave filled my shoes with water. ‘But after life’s long story there’s\r\nthe devil’s bill to meet.’”\r\n\r\n“What are you singing?” Harborough stopped to ask.\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” and Bill stood on one foot while she emptied the water out\r\nof her shoe.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but what was it?”\r\n\r\nBill recited the verse to him and began to water her seed-patch.\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you come nearer?” Harborough asked. “All the men in the yard\r\nwill hear what you are saying.”\r\n\r\n“There are none there now, they are all eating their lunch in the barn;\r\nbesides what does it matter if they do? It will do no harm.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no; it might even do some good; it is almost a pity they should\r\nnot be edified by your--hymn is it?”\r\n\r\nBill looked up arrested by his tone. “It isn’t a hymn,” she said, “but\r\nit is true all the same, every bit of it, the laughter and the work and\r\nthe bill, only I don’t think you always have to wait till the end of\r\nlife’s long story for that. After all it is only fair; you must expect\r\nto pay a good price for a good thing,--and it is good!”\r\n\r\n“Which? The broken cucumber-frame or your own work? You are admiring\r\nboth.”\r\n\r\n“Everything,--just being alive.”\r\n\r\n“Do you consider one is in the devil’s debt for life? It is a new idea.”\r\n\r\n“No, not exactly that. The debt you owe is the wrong you do. You have\r\nnot half lived if you have done no wrong; you miss an awful lot if you\r\nnever do any wrong,--don’t you think so?”\r\n\r\nShe looked up as she spoke. Wrong so prefigured appeared wonderfully\r\nalluring, for there was an indescribable provocation in her face and\r\nfigure, a fascination, nay, a temptation personified, which roused the\r\nyouth in him, stirring the pulses usually so cool. Theory and reason\r\nare all very well, admirable in fact for ordinary use, but young blood\r\nwill course in spite of them; the world’s spring will not always take\r\n_no_ for answer.\r\n\r\nHarborough went home that day vibrating with an emotion which was\r\nstrange to him. Afterwards, when he was cool again, he was ashamed of\r\nit, for it did not seem exactly a good thing, and he vowed he would\r\nnot go near the garden again. Yet how could he help himself? In a\r\nrash moment he had offered to mend the broken cucumber-frame for the\r\ngirl, and she, serenely unconscious of his emotions, had accepted the\r\noffer. There had not been time then: Theresa wanted her in the house\r\nin five minutes; but he would come some other time. She had suggested\r\nto-morrow, or any day he liked. It did not matter when it was done, but\r\nit had to be done; he had left himself no choice.\r\n\r\nThat same evening he met Theresa in the lane, and, acting on impulse,\r\nhe told her of his offer to mend the frame. On the whole, he thought\r\nit better, even if she put a false construction on his actions, than\r\njumping the fence some morning when Bill was alone in the garden. But\r\nTheresa did not put any construction whatever on his actions; she\r\nlooked upon her young cousin as more of a child than she really was,\r\nand much more of one than Harborough thought her. “She told me you\r\noffered to do it,” Theresa said; “it is very kind of you, I’m sure. She\r\nhas taken a great fancy to gardening, and I am glad of it, though I\r\ncannot give her much help myself, for I know so little about it, and am\r\nso busy besides.”\r\n\r\nHarborough assured her he was pleased to give any assistance he could,\r\nand Theresa thanked him again for sparing his valuable time, and\r\ninvited him to do so to-morrow afternoon, and to have tea afterwards.\r\n\r\nThis he did, he and Bill spending an hour in the garden before tea.\r\nThat afternoon Bill did not arouse any sentiments, unholy or otherwise,\r\nin his breast, neither did she sing or whistle; she devoted herself to\r\nbusiness, and Harborough, having of late worked with farm-labourers,\r\nfound it a refreshing change to work with a person who understood what\r\nwas wanted and did as she was told. “She has more common-sense than\r\nmost of the men I know,” was the opinion he formed that day, both when\r\nthey were at work before tea, and when they were at the table later\r\non. Her intercourse with Robert Morton impressed him very much; she\r\nhad gauged the man’s character to a nicety, and Harborough could not\r\nbut see that she understood him better, blamed him less, and could do\r\ninfinitely more with him than could his stately young wife. He was\r\nnot sure that he liked her the better for that. “An odd girl,” was\r\nhis opinion, when at last he had convinced himself that she was not\r\nreally conscious of the part she was playing; “she simply reflects\r\nher surroundings, but--” His ideal of womanhood was not a changing\r\nelf, a will-o’-the-wisp, a creature who could in mind enter into all\r\nthings, reflect all things, good, bad, and indifferent, without judging\r\nor condemning. Woman should be above man; she should not understand\r\nevil except when he taught her; she should be merciful, of course,\r\nwith the mercy of love, the pity of superiority, but not tolerant\r\nwith the liberality of good fellowship; she should have nothing in\r\ncommon with a man like Robert Morton; she should be something fairer,\r\nbetter--unconsciously he looked at Theresa.\r\n\r\nYet Bill fascinated him. She was not fair, above, apart; she was of\r\nthe earth earthy, a brownie by the hearth, not a goddess for a shrine.\r\nAnd yet the last thing in his waking thoughts that night was the dark\r\nglowing face watching him from the gate, the first thing that haunted\r\nhis dreams was the small figure gliding into the green twilight of the\r\nnut-bushes."

      "content": "WILHELMINA I. AND II.\r\n\nPolly always declared she foresaw the end from the very beginning of\r\nthe affair, and certainly at the outset of Miss Brownlow’s illness she\r\nprophesied fatal results; but then she always did foretell the worst,\r\nand Bella said she did not believe her, though she sobbed as she said\r\nit. But it seemed so impossible: Miss Brownlow only slipped down the\r\nlast four or five of the cellar-stairs; Jane was getting coals at the\r\ntime, and declared she saw her and could swear it was not more than\r\nfive steps. She must have struck her head on the corner at the bottom,\r\nfor it was so long before she recovered consciousness, and she seemed\r\nto so wander in her mind when she did recover. This was before she\r\nbecame very ill; after that took place Polly did not prophesy anything;\r\nthe cousins only looked at one another in silence.\r\n\r\nBut before that time Theresa had come. Bella was so intensely relieved\r\nby her coming, that she did not for a moment dispute with Polly for\r\nthe right of bringing her. She sat by Miss Brownlow’s side alone while\r\nPolly was away; the room was so dark, for the blinds were pulled down\r\nand the day was overcast, that she could barely see to correct the\r\npile of exercise-books before her. As yet the school had not been\r\nbroken up; but the noise of the children did not seem to disturb Miss\r\nBrownlow, hardly even to reach her as she lay in semi-stupor. Neither\r\nof the cousins felt it wise to dismiss their pupils lightly, and,\r\nnotwithstanding Polly’s prophetic warnings, neither really anticipated\r\nthe worst, or fully realised the serious nature of the accident.\r\n\r\nOn account of the school Polly was not able to leave Wrugglesby till\r\nafter four o’clock; but, seeing the grave nature of her errand, she\r\nordered a fly from the Red Lion in spite of Bella’s demur at the\r\nextravagance, and drove away in becoming state and solemnity. Bill was\r\nworking in the garden at the time of the arrival at Haylands; when she\r\nwent to the pump for water to wash her hands before tea she saw the fly\r\nstanding in the yard.\r\n\r\n“Whose is that?” she asked as she pumped water into a wooden bowl.\r\n\r\nSam, with the milk-pails on his way to the dairy, stood contemplating\r\nthe object.\r\n\r\n“Don’t roightly know,” he said.\r\n\r\nBill carried her bowl to a wooden bench outside the dairy door, brought\r\na large piece of yellow soap from the wash-house, rolled up her sleeves\r\nand proceeded to wash; the refinements of life did not at that time\r\ngreatly trouble her. The man with the pails followed her to the dairy,\r\nwent in and began pouring the milk into the pans.\r\n\r\n“Oi shouldn’t be s’proised if that b’longed to Wazzel,” he said\r\nglancing down the yard; “looks loike ’is shay, that do.”\r\n\r\n“Wazzel of the Red Lion? Who has come from Wrugglesby?”\r\n\r\n“Come fr’ Wrugglesby? Oh, it’s one o’ the Misses’s sisters as come, but\r\nI’m not sartin that is Wazzel’s--”\r\n\r\n“Which one? Bella, the pretty one?”\r\n\r\n“No, the old ’un. Wazzel--”\r\n\r\nBut Bill had gone with still wet hands to see what had brought Polly to\r\nAshelton. She knew, directly she looked into the room, that there was\r\nsomething wrong, or that Polly was persuading herself there was. There\r\nwas an air of momentous gravity about Polly, of depressing, dignified\r\nsolemnity which pervaded the whole room and infected all present. Even\r\nthe frivolous young maid, who was setting out the tea-things, looked\r\nawed and spread the best cloth out of respect for the gravity of the\r\nvisitor. Robert, who was also there, seemed glum and silent, and Polly\r\nwas not attempting to entertain him according to her usual manner; she\r\nwas acting up to the situation and enjoying it proportionately.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?” Bill asked.\r\n\r\nTheresa turned, and Bill knew when she saw her face that there was real\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n“Aunt is very ill,” Polly answered, “and I have come for Theresa.”\r\n\r\n“Ill?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but not dangerously,” Theresa hastily explained; “at least we\r\nhope not,--we are sure it cannot be,--she was quite well a day or two\r\nago. She has had a tumble down-stairs which has shaken her a good deal.\r\nIt is so difficult for Polly and Bella to nurse her and look after the\r\nschool too, that they want me to go and help.”\r\n\r\n“I see.” Bill was greatly relieved.\r\n\r\n“How long has she been ill? How bad is she?”\r\n\r\nThey told her, Polly characteristically painting the case black,\r\nTheresa white. Bill was left to draw her own conclusions, based on\r\nthe one fact that Polly usually served the truth in the sauce she\r\nconsidered most fitting, and on the other that Theresa really knew very\r\nlittle of the state of the case. In the end she did not know what to\r\nthink; her fears were half aroused, yet she could not believe matters\r\nreally were serious; nothing serious had happened within her memory,\r\nand it did not seem possible that it could now. That which needed the\r\nmost consideration, however, was not so much what had happened as\r\nthe more immediate question of Theresa’s leaving home. This proved\r\ndifficult to arrange; she hardly knew what to do.\r\n\r\n“The dairy needs a lot of management just now,” she said, “and Jessie\r\nreally is very inexperienced; she has been with us such a little time\r\ntoo.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think I could do anything?” Bill asked.\r\n\r\nTheresa looked at her doubtfully, but Robert, who was tired of the\r\ndiscussion, said shortly: “Of course she could; there is not such a lot\r\nto do. You had better get your things together and go back at once;\r\nthere’s no need for any more talk about it.”\r\n\r\nIt was nice of Robert to give permission so readily, even if he did not\r\ngive it graciously. No doubt Polly thought so, as she cast a quick,\r\ncomprehending glance at him from the corner of her small dark eyes.\r\n“Thank you,” she said; “I’m sure it is very nice of you to spare her;\r\nwe are so much obliged, so very much. Now, Theresa, you can come with a\r\nlight heart,--as soon as we have had tea; we may as well wait for that.\r\nWe must have tea somewhere, and it takes no longer in one place than\r\nanother.”\r\n\r\nSo Theresa drove away with Polly, leaving Bill for a day or two only,\r\nshe said, though in her heart she thought it likely to be longer. Bill\r\nalso thought it possible, and took over the charge of the house and\r\ndairy rather in anticipation of such an event. Taking over the charge\r\nwas a serious matter in Bill’s opinion; Jessie also found it a serious\r\nmatter, for with the cheerful and friendly Bill she found herself\r\nworking as she had never worked before. Bill loved work in all its\r\nbranches, and somehow those with her usually had to work too, either\r\nbecause they were infected by her energy, or because they could not\r\navoid it; but for some reason they usually worked. Jessie worked now as\r\nshe never did before or afterwards, until she got a house of her own\r\nand a husband to keep.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted Bill did a great deal more than there was any\r\nnecessity to do, a great deal more than Theresa did or expected to be\r\ndone; the only thing which prevented her from doing yet more was a\r\ndesire to go on with her gardening. It was one morning when she was\r\nhurrying over the last of the butter-making so as to get out to her\r\nplants that Mr. Dane came and hindered her awhile. He came to ask if\r\nsome of the skimmed milk could be sent to Mrs. Hutton, an old woman at\r\nAshelton End. He was going to the front door in the orthodox manner\r\nbut, hearing Bill singing gaily in the dairy, he went round the end\r\nof the house and came to seek her at her work. He knew Theresa had\r\ngone to Wrugglesby; all Ashelton knew that, for Miss Minchin, from the\r\nvantage-point of her corner window, had seen the fly from the Red Lion\r\ndrive past. She had kept a careful watch on the road till the same\r\nvehicle drove back, even sitting at tea with one eye on the window and\r\nthe other on the tea-pot, so as to have a really good look at it on\r\nits return journey and to see Mrs. Morton and another lady inside.\r\n\r\nOn account of this sight, doubting that Mrs. Morton could have left her\r\ncousin alone at Haylands, thinking that, had she done so, the young\r\ncreature might be lonely, or want a little help, Miss Minchin set off\r\nto see her the very next afternoon. Bill was in the garden at the time,\r\nfortunately out of sight of the drawing-room window, when Jessie came\r\nto tell her of the visitor.\r\n\r\n“What does she want?” Bill asked.\r\n\r\n“To see you, Miss. I expect she wants to find out about the Missis, if\r\nthe truth were known.” Jessie knew Miss Minchin by reputation.\r\n\r\n“Well, you could have told her that,” said Bill, loth to leave her\r\ngardening.\r\n\r\n“But she didn’t ask me. Lor’, miss, she pretends she’s come to see you.”\r\n\r\n“To call?” Bill asked, and Jessie nodded.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Bill delighted, and ran to the pump. She made a back-door\r\ntoilette and presented herself in the drawing-room quite unconscious\r\nof the quantity of loam on her short skirts. Miss Minchin found out\r\nall Bill could tell her, offered (and really meant it) any assistance\r\nshe could give, and had, as she said, “a very nice little chat,” Bill\r\nplaying hostess most successfully. She went away quite satisfied, told\r\nMiss Gruet all she had heard and all she surmised, and at the end of\r\nthree days everyone in Ashelton and Ashelton End and Brook Ashelton,\r\neven including Mr. Dane, knew something of Mrs. Morton’s summons to\r\nWrugglesby. Consequently, when on that sunny April morning the rector\r\nheard the vigorous young voice singing in the dairy, he knew that the\r\nlady of the house was to be found there.\r\n\r\nBill was singing a perfectly irreproachable hymn, occasionally, when\r\nher work became very engrossing, leaving off or perhaps humming a bar\r\nor two; but just as Mr. Dane drew near she broke out at the top of her\r\nvoice so that she did not hear his approach, nor did she know that he\r\nwas there until he stopped in the doorway.\r\n\r\n“Good-morning,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Good-morning,” she replied, giving him a large smile of welcome. “Do\r\nyou want me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but please don’t let me interrupt you; you look very busy.”\r\n\r\nBill was making butter-pats, and apparently had been churning earlier,\r\nfor the butter-milk still dripped from her bare elbows. She was\r\nstanding on a small inverted wash-tub, for the shelves were high and\r\nshe liked to be well above her work. “I am rather busy,” she said;\r\n“come in and sit down, won’t you? That pickle-tub is quite safe; the\r\nlid won’t give way.”\r\n\r\nThe rector came in and sat down, making his request for milk at the\r\nsame time.\r\n\r\n“She shall have some,” Bill said after a moment’s thought. “I will take\r\nher some by-and-bye, if that will do; or do you want her to have it\r\nearlier?”\r\n\r\nMr. Dane said that would do, though on second thoughts he suggested\r\nthat, if convenient, he would take the milk himself as he was going to\r\nMrs. Hutton.\r\n\r\nBill mentally rearranged the milk at her disposal and said he could\r\nhave it now. Had she been Theresa, she would have insisted that the boy\r\nshould carry the can to the cottage; being Bill she did no such thing,\r\nfor she had set the boy some weeding which would take all his time. She\r\nvolunteered to carry it herself as soon as the butter should be done,\r\nand would have been pleased to do so. It never occurred to her that the\r\ncarrying of a milk-can could appear to Mr. Dane in a different light\r\nfrom that in which it did to her; and fortunately she was right.\r\n\r\nShe went off to find a can, and it took her some few minutes to do so.\r\nAs she searched, the old man heard her softly complete the interrupted\r\nverse of the hymn she had been singing, and the varied richness of her\r\nvoice struck him forcibly.\r\n\r\n“You have a very remarkable voice, my child,” he said when she came\r\nback.\r\n\r\nBill coloured a little with pleasure. “I believe I can imitate other\r\nsounds better than I can do anything else,” she said; and to illustrate\r\nher words she mimicked with rare perfection the liquid recurrent\r\nwhistle of a thrush in the apple-tree outside the window. “Perhaps it\r\nis because I have got a correct ear,” she added, as if apologising for\r\nher own skill.\r\n\r\n“I think you must have,” he answered, “and a good memory too. You\r\nremember what you have once heard perhaps? Yes? Tell me, then, where\r\ndid you hear the song you sang at Mrs. Dawson’s?”\r\n\r\nThe old man was looking at her very keenly, almost eagerly. She gave\r\nthe butter an unnecessary thump as she answered, “I don’t know,” and\r\nthen added somewhat defiantly, “I never thought they would mind it.”\r\n\r\n“Mind it? Who minded it? How did you learn it? Think,--tell me whom you\r\nhave heard sing it.”\r\n\r\nBill saw that Mr. Dane had found no offence in the song, and being\r\nreassured she set herself to answer his question. “I cannot tell you\r\nhow I came to know it,” she said; “I have never seen the music in\r\nprint that I can remember. The greater part of the words I found with\r\nsome letters and things which are kept in an old box at home. When I\r\nread them I seemed to recognise them, and remembered the part that was\r\nmissing,--you know the way I mean, the way you grope things out of your\r\nmind. At first I thought I would take the paper away: then I thought\r\nI ought not to, so I just learned them by heart. As for the music, it\r\nseems to belong to the words--don’t you think so? I can only suppose my\r\nfather used to sing the song, perhaps very often, and I have remembered\r\nit, though in that case it may not be quite right.”\r\n\r\n“There was one mistake; you did not repeat the refrain with sufficient\r\naccuracy in the latter part of the song.”\r\n\r\n“You have heard it before!” Bill exclaimed in astonishment. “You know\r\nit too!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I have heard it--many years ago, very many; that is why I\r\nwondered how you came to know it; I did not think it had been sung\r\nlately.”\r\n\r\nHe rose as he spoke, and held out his hand for the can. He looked\r\nold and weary, yet withal a very fine and courteous gentleman though\r\nstanding among milk-pans talking to a little dairy-maid. Bill wondered\r\nif he had heard the song when he was young, and if it were very long\r\nago. She gave him the milk-can saying, “I will send the same quantity\r\nto-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, thank you, little Mistress Bill. Bill,--it’s a name to fit\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nShe laughed. “Better than Wilhelmina,” she said. “That is ever so much\r\ntoo long; I was called Wilhelmina after my grandmother.”\r\n\r\nHe stopped on the threshold. For a moment he leaned against the\r\ndoor-post; the lined face looked gray in the shaded light, though\r\nperhaps only by reason of it, for he merely said, “Yes, yes, of course,\r\nWilhelmina Alardy,--good-bye,” and so went away with his milk-can.\r\n\r\nWilhelmina Alardy! Of course she was Wilhelmina Alardy; he knew that\r\nbefore. And the other Wilhelmina was her grandmother; of course he\r\nhad known that too, or at least he almost felt as if he had. Not that\r\nshe was like, not like at all, not even in face; he could trace no\r\nresemblance to the first Wilhelmina, tall and slim and queenly, with\r\nher beautiful black hair. Bill’s hair was dark, it is true, but with a\r\nglowing, coppery darkness, brown shot with red, a colour of which a man\r\nwas never sure even when he thought he saw it in her eyes. Wilhelmina’s\r\neyes were different, dark, proud, passionate. Bill’s were not proud,\r\nnor were they passionate; but they took possession of a man’s mind;\r\nthey held an indescribable charm not to be forgotten, they were,--they\r\nwere other eyes, another face--\r\n\r\nMr. Dane turned abruptly from the painting he was contemplating; he was\r\nat home now, his visit to Mrs. Hutton having been an unusually brief\r\none. When he reached home he locked himself in his study so that he\r\nshould not be disturbed. His housekeeper thought he was busy over his\r\nsermon; but if he was, his text was an old portrait taken from a locked\r\ndrawer, and his subject a beautiful woman, young and proud, to whom\r\nthe painter had given a milk-white skin and curling black hair. Her\r\ngown sloped away on the shoulders in the fashion of forty years ago,\r\nand her brow curved softly in that fashion too; but the painter, in\r\nspite of a laudable desire to bring the face within the then prevailing\r\nstandard of beauty, had not been able to flatter the chin out of its\r\nimperious waywardness nor the eyes out of their proud unrest.\r\n\r\nThere was no likeness to Bill in this face of the other Wilhelmina; and\r\nyet--this was but one of the looks she had worn--who should say there\r\nwas not some of her sleeping undeveloped in the girl of to-day? Men\r\nknow so little of the working of such things. Who could say how many\r\nof Wilhelmina’s reckless ancestors had gone to the making of Bill, had\r\nrevived in Bill, gipsy Bill? Of course she was gipsy; Anthony Alardy\r\nwas half a gipsy, dark-faced, lawless, part sinner, part saint, knight\r\nand churl in one; a child of nature alive with a glowing vitality,\r\nimpregnated with a magnetism, a charm, a quality without a name, hard\r\nto define yet harder still to defy. To this day the man who sat with\r\nthe old portrait in his hand could recall, ay, and acknowledge, the\r\ncharm, even though he owed to it so much of sorrow and dishonour in\r\nthe long ago. And the voice! He remembered the voice too; the musician\r\nin him could never forget it, for he would never hear such another. He\r\nmight hate it,--he did hate it, all the man in him hated it--but the\r\nmusician could not, and could never forget.\r\n\r\n Red is the rose thou hast bound in thy hair.\r\n\r\nThat night there were red roses in her hair, he remembered,--how he\r\nremembered! And the song--what music, what passion of melody! It was\r\nnot art, it was nature, man’s nature, woman’s nature crying out,\r\npassion which swelled up and spoke, to be answered, to be satisfied.\r\n\r\nMr. Dane put the portrait of his young wife away, put it away and, by\r\ndegrees put away too the scenes and memories which had returned to him.\r\nStrange that after so many years the past should return thus, stranger\r\nstill, since it did return, that pain should outweigh all other\r\nfeelings now. Where had gone the sense of injury, the shame, the agony,\r\nthe unforgiving hate? They were gone, all was only a pain now; thank\r\nGod for it, and for the mercy of the years, the pity and the merciful\r\nwisdom learned of the long, patient years.\r\n\r\nHe locked the drawer and put away the key. She was dead, dead long\r\nago. And her grandchild was here, singing the old passionate song;\r\nlooking out on the world with eager, unknowing eyes; containing in\r\nherself funded possibilities handed down from a dead past, acquired\r\nfrom circumstance, environment, a hundred things of which a man cannot\r\njudge, on which he cannot reason. Her grandchild! A little brown\r\ncreature full of untold possibilities! Her grandchild? Almost she might\r\nhave been his own--for a moment he fancied he hated her for it. Might\r\nhave been? Had she been she would not have been such as she now was;\r\nand after all, that was the thing which concerned him, the thing which\r\nhe had, if need be, to help."

      "content": "NATURAL SELECTION.\r\n\nBill, of course, knew nothing of what was in the rector’s mind; she\r\nonly wondered once or twice about the song, and decided to sing it\r\nno more in public since the greater number of her acquaintances\r\ndisapproved of it, and the one whose opinion she most valued did not\r\nlike it. Harborough liked it or had seemed to like it on the night\r\nshe sang it at the Dawsons’. But she was not quite sure of him, for\r\nshe had begun to think there were two separate persons in Gilchrist\r\nHarborough,--one a strong, cool, somewhat old young man whose only\r\nweakness was theories, and who was the normal and usual person in\r\npossession; the other a very different person, who only looked out now\r\nand then, by accident as it were. It was to this last that the song\r\nappealed, this last who waked once or twice under her influence. She\r\nwas not sure, but she rather fancied Harborough despised this second\r\nself, even denied its existence. That was a pity, in her opinion, for\r\nthe second self was the thing in him which played, which laughed, and\r\nenjoyed life and despised theories. For this reason, and also for pure\r\nmischief, Bill tried occasionally to rouse this other self.\r\n\r\nShe had not many opportunities, for Harborough was very guarded, and\r\nby degrees, since she was much absorbed in her work, she forgot all\r\nabout it, though she saw him often while Theresa was at Wrugglesby. It\r\nis true, if he passed when she was working in the garden he did not\r\nusually stop to say more than “good-afternoon”; indeed, had she only\r\nknown it, his demeanour on those occasions suggested “lead us not into\r\ntemptation” in a manner which was scarcely complimentary. However, as\r\nit happened, about this time business brought Harborough to Robert,\r\nand Robert brought him to Haylands, where of necessity he saw Bill.\r\nEven when he did not come to the house, he met her in the yard or barns\r\nor dairy, “looking diligently to the ways of her household.” There\r\ncould be no doubt as to her capabilities and diligence as a housewife;\r\nHarborough never saw her now without being impressed with her ability\r\nand, indeed, with her great suitability for the post of mistress of a\r\nworking-farm.\r\n\r\nEvents, or rather his opinions, culminated on the afternoon when he\r\ninvited her to take shelter from the rain in Crows’ Farm. It was very\r\nheavy rain and very sudden, and she had on her best hat; in ordinary\r\ncircumstances she would have declined his hospitality and paddled\r\ncheerfully home, but the hat was not ordinary; so she accepted his\r\noffer and took shelter under his roof for the hour that the rain\r\nlasted. While there she made tea for him without disturbing the method\r\nof his arrangements; she washed the cups without splashing his scrubbed\r\ntable, and she did not, even when asked for her opinion, say that his\r\nway of keeping kitchen utensils was wrong. Finally she sat by the\r\nsmouldering fire with folded hands saying with unmistakable sincerity\r\nthat his manner of living was one after her own heart.\r\n\r\n“You would like it?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes, better than anything except gipsying.”\r\n\r\n“You would not like that,” he told her smiling. “At least when you came\r\nto know what it was really like, you would not.”\r\n\r\n“You think not? Perhaps so; I don’t know much about it: have you tried?”\r\n\r\n“Rather not,” he said; “I have tried bush-life though.”\r\n\r\n“Is that like it?”\r\n\r\n“No; not altogether. There are not so many fellow-gipsies in that; also\r\nthere are not necessarily dirt and dishonesty.”\r\n\r\n“But there are sometimes?” Bill asked as if she were anxious there\r\nshould be.\r\n\r\n“Occasionally you run against queer customers, men from the ends of the\r\nearth, who had very much better have stayed there, if they could not\r\ncontrive to drop off altogether.”\r\n\r\n“I should think they were worse than fellow-gipsies,” Bill observed.\r\n\r\n“That’s a matter of opinion; besides, there is always plenty of room\r\nthere, and you don’t come across them often. I think the thing which\r\nstrikes me most of all here is the smallness; it is all so ‘preserved.’”\r\n\r\nBill was interested. “I should like to see the bush,” she said.\r\n\r\n“It is not much to see,” he told her, but added, “station-life would\r\nsuit you; I believe you would like that.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me about it.” And he told her what he thought would interest her,\r\nshe listening with eager face.\r\n\r\nAnd thus they spent the time pleasantly enough until the rain ceased\r\nsufficiently for her to go home. He walked to the gate with her, and\r\nthen went back to his barns and sheds revolving in his mind a theory he\r\nhad not much considered before,--the theory of natural selection, which\r\nhe interpreted to mean the wisdom of choosing your wife as you choose\r\nyour horse, for general suitability to your purpose.\r\n\r\nShe was young, it was true, and perhaps a little wild, but she could be\r\ntrained; she would also sober down of herself, and she would probably\r\nnever develop her latent possibilities for mischief if she married\r\nearly. She was not what one would describe as tractable, though she was\r\naccommodating, far too accommodating not to be more or less submissive\r\nto superior experience. And she was all one could desire for practical\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nPractical purposes! That was just it; in adopting a practical farmer’s\r\nlife he found he needed a practical farmer’s wife; there was no room\r\nat his hearth for the stately lady whom fancy (not yet dead) had once\r\npainted in that position. There was something wrong with the present\r\narrangement; a man either wanted to be something less or else to\r\nhave something more than modern codes allowed. The patriarch Abraham\r\nsupplied what must even then have been a long-felt want, in taking,\r\nbesides the chief and lady wife, a humbler working partner.\r\n\r\nHarborough was not a man given to acting hastily, at least the\r\nparamount person in his character was not; concerning the other\r\nperson he did not know much. He thought a long time of Bill and her\r\nsuitability for his purpose, entirely oblivious for the moment of her\r\ncurious attractions; but he could come to no conclusion either as to\r\nwhether he wanted her or whether, if he did, she wanted him. However,\r\nhe need not have wearied himself with the consideration that night,\r\nfor, as it chanced, he had almost a month in which to think it over\r\nbefore he saw her again. That very evening she went to Wrugglesby and\r\ndid not come back to Ashelton for some weeks.\r\n\r\nAs she crossed the yard on her homeward way, Robert met her, his heavy\r\nface wearing a look of real concern.\r\n\r\n“Bear up, little girl!” was his greeting, for he saw that his face had\r\nalready broken the bad news. “Cheer up! It hasn’t come to the worst\r\nyet, and we’re not going to be frightened into thinking it’s coming,\r\neither;--we’re just going to drive in to Wrugglesby and see.”\r\n\r\n“Have they sent for me?” she asked, her face whitening.\r\n\r\n“Yes,--you’re not going to cry, are you? It mayn’t be so bad as all\r\nthat. There’s a brave girl! Run in and get a wrap or something, you’ll\r\nbe cold before you get there. They’ll have Beauty in the cart in a\r\ntwinkling, and you shall drive her if you like.”\r\n\r\nBill smiled a little; he was trying to comfort her as well as he could\r\nand she was grateful for the intention. She even pretended to be\r\npleased to drive the spirited mare hitherto forbidden to her; it might\r\nhave hurt him if she had not. It might have hurt him if she had refused\r\nthe sweets he kept popping in her mouth, and she ate them though each\r\none seemed as if it would choke her.\r\n\r\nHe talked a little during the first part of the drive and she tried to\r\nanswer him, but after a while he felt the wisdom of silence, and they\r\nboth became quiet until just as he handed her out at Langford House\r\nhe said awkwardly: “You shall never want for anything while I live, I\r\nswear you sha’n’t! Theresa and I will always have a home for you,--mind\r\nthat, little girl.”"

      "content": "CHASING A SHADOW.\r\n\nMr. James Brownlow was a busy man; a hard-working solicitor, partner\r\nin an old firm, and a good firm though scarcely a rich one. He was\r\nnot rich himself; he had worked hard all his life to attain moderate\r\ncomfort, and he continued to work hard, though he was now past\r\nmiddle-age, partly to maintain the same standard of comfort, and partly\r\nbecause he cherished a delusion that nothing in the firm could go on\r\nwithout him. But, in spite of his business and its importance, he felt\r\nbound to devote a certain amount of time to the affairs of the late\r\nMiss Isabella Brownlow. It is true she was not a very near relation,\r\nbut he had been legal adviser as well as relation, and moreover, the\r\nnieces she left seemed to be in a particularly solitary condition.\r\n\r\n“But one is married, I thought,” Mrs. Brownlow objected from the\r\nfurther end of the dinner-table. The train from Wrugglesby had\r\nbeen late, and made the dinner late too; accordingly the lamb was\r\novercooked, and the clockwork regularity of the household disturbed.\r\nMrs. Brownlow felt slightly annoyed; also she considered that if one of\r\nthe nieces was married her husband should have taken over the affairs\r\nof the family, instead of troubling somebody else’s husband,--and,\r\nincidentally, somebody else’s excellent cook.\r\n\r\nMr. Brownlow probably knew these sentiments, but he was not disturbed\r\nby them that night for the importance of business was great in his\r\neyes; moreover, he had been discreetly handled earlier in the day.\r\n“Yes,” he said, “yes, one is married, comfortably married, I should\r\nsay; but a man is not bound to take over his wife’s family. He has\r\nprofessed himself quite ready to give a home to the youngest girl; the\r\nothers will carry on the school.”\r\n\r\n“A wise plan, I should think,” Mrs. Brownlow said, with a sigh. She\r\nwas always sadly affected by the delinquencies of the present age,\r\nwhich she possessed great abilities for discovering. “It is liberal of\r\nhim,” she went on. “I suppose he will be repaid by the girl finding out\r\none day that she is unable to bear a dependent position and must make\r\nher own way in the world, after having had a long training for it at\r\nsomebody else’s expense. Girls usually get such ideas nowadays.”\r\n\r\nMr. Brownlow agreed with the general sentiment, but defended this\r\nparticular girl. “I don’t think she is that sort at all,” he said. “She\r\nis very young, a plain, quiet little thing; she looked docile; Miss\r\nHains spoke of her as if she were a child.”\r\n\r\n“There is no family?” Mrs. Brownlow asked. “I mean the married\r\none,--Mrs. Morton, didn’t you say the name was--has no family?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“But if she has by-and-bye, what will become of this girl? Can they\r\nafford to keep her? Is it wise, do you think?”\r\n\r\n“I have talked it all over with Miss Hains who really is a sensible\r\nwoman. She is five and thirty, I dare say, and a sensible, clever\r\nwoman.” Polly might have been considered clever in some senses of the\r\nword; that she had certain claims to ability was proved by the opinion\r\nshe had produced in Mr. Brownlow’s mind. “She and I,” went on the\r\nworthy gentleman unconsciously placing the persons in their right order\r\nof importance, “she and I have decided that her cousin Wilhelmina had\r\nbetter return home with Mrs. Morton for the present. The school is\r\nnot larger than she herself, with the assistance of Miss Waring, can\r\nmanage. In the course of time they hope to increase it, when Wilhelmina\r\ncan come back to help them with the younger pupils.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Brownlow thought this an excellent arrangement and asked for\r\npersonal details of its originator.\r\n\r\n“Miss Hains? No, she is not handsome,” her husband said in answer to\r\nher question, “but a sensible, practical woman. Really it is quite\r\nsurprising how business-like she is when you come to think that she\r\nhas lived so long in that little country town,--how business-like\r\nand yet how very womanly, how essentially feminine, not in the least\r\nself-assertive and opinionated.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the golden opinions Polly had won from Mr. Brownlow. Hardly\r\nso flattering was her opinion of him, which she was at that same time\r\nexpressing to Bella and Bill as they sat together in the twilight.\r\n\r\nThe first shock of their grief was now over. It is true there was an\r\naching blank left in their lives by the death of this kindly, not\r\nover-wise aunt, but the first sharpness was over, the first ache a\r\nlittle dulled. Bella and Theresa had lost their own mother not so many\r\nyears ago, and though they had dearly loved their aunt, the loss of her\r\nwas not what the earlier grief had been, nor yet what it was to Bill\r\nwho could remember no mother. Bill’s loss was greatest, and greatest\r\nalso to her was the shock, for this was the first time real sorrow had\r\ntouched her life. She had, too, more time and opportunity to think\r\nabout it, having, as the youngest, but little to do with all the plans\r\nand work consequent upon Miss Brownlow’s death. Polly, of course, was\r\nvery busy: mourning alone offered a large field for her energies, for\r\nthe cousins could not afford to employ even the local milliner and\r\ndressmaker.\r\n\r\n“We must let them dress us for the funeral,” Polly had said, but added,\r\n“I hardly think we need get Bill’s hat there; I will do that myself,\r\nfor we must save wherever we can. As for other clothes, we must manage\r\nsomehow; one good dress apiece is all we can afford.”\r\n\r\nAnd she had sighed; extensive mourning would have compensated her\r\nsomewhat for a much heavier bereavement. Not but that she did mourn for\r\nMiss Brownlow; her grief was real, though perhaps not quite so deep\r\nas theirs, thought Bella and Theresa. As for Bill, when she had cried\r\nherself sick with the abandonment of childhood, she felt an hysterical\r\ninclination to laugh as she watched the perfection of Polly’s sorrow.\r\nIt was real, as real as any other of Polly’s feelings; she felt it\r\nafter her fashion, but principally because it was the fashion to feel\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBy the May evening when Mr. Brownlow so much commended Polly, that\r\n“sensible and practical woman” considered it time to abate the first\r\nintensity of her grief. She had been abating it by degrees, and during\r\nMr. Brownlow’s visit had shown a demeanour of subdued sorrow blent\r\nwith practical common-sense. After his departure she subdued her\r\nsorrow still more, and when the cousins sat together that evening she\r\ndiscussed matters with the air of one who, having paid off the funeral\r\n_cortège_, now opens the shutters and prepares to return to the normal\r\ncondition of things. Theresa had gone home to Haylands; she had been\r\nobliged to go back there some time before, but had driven to Wrugglesby\r\nwith Robert that day so as to be present during Mr. Brownlow’s visit.\r\nThe school was to re-open at the beginning of the next week, the\r\nholidays on account of Miss Brownlow’s death being deducted from the\r\nmidsummer vacation; an unavoidable arrangement not much to Polly’s\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n“We are too poor to afford sorrow,” she observed; “at least comfortable\r\nsorrow.”\r\n\r\n“As if comfort mattered at such a time!” Bella replied with scorn.\r\nShe was leaning with her elbows on the sill, looking through the open\r\nwindow into the street.\r\n\r\nPolly was of opinion that it did matter, but she did not explain her\r\nviews at length, for she wanted to talk over Mr. Brownlow’s suggestion.\r\n\r\n“You and I,” she said to Bella, “are to keep on this school for the\r\nrest of our lives. We must move into a smaller house to do it when the\r\nlease of this one is up. How would Chestnut Villa do? It is empty now,\r\nand I don’t expect anyone will take it before then; it is too mouldy.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” acquiesced Bella in a spiritless voice. She looked across the\r\nempty, darkening street to the doctor’s prim house opposite; the\r\nscent of the laburnums came to her from his garden, the sound of a\r\nwheel-barrow from a neighbour’s close by. It was all very dull and\r\nnarrow and small--and the prospect offered? It is hard to be young and\r\nfair and told at two-and-twenty that to live at Chestnut Villa (too\r\nmouldy for anyone else) and teach small girls is one’s fate beyond\r\nredemption.\r\n\r\n“We are to keep on with the school,” Polly was saying.\r\n\r\n“I suppose so.” Bella did not look round.\r\n\r\n“Do you?” Polly retorted. “I don’t then! For one thing, I don’t suppose\r\nthe school will keep on with us.”\r\n\r\nBella did look round now. “It will, it must!” she exclaimed. “What else\r\nare we to do?”\r\n\r\n“It won’t,” Polly affirmed with confidence. “Look how it has gone down\r\neven while poor Aunt, whom everyone knew, was here. If she,--and people\r\nsent their children to her out of friendship or because their cousins\r\nor someone used to come--if she could not keep it together, what are we\r\nlikely to do? You can teach, but you have not passed many examinations,\r\nand you are young and not at all imposing; as for me, I have no\r\ncertificates at all.”\r\n\r\n“But, Polly, you are clever in your own way; surely you could get\r\npupils?”\r\n\r\nPolly did not think so, and she proceeded to make a statement of the\r\ncase,--which girls were leaving, which likely to leave, and which among\r\nthose living in the district were likely to come to Langford House, the\r\nlast appearing to be very few. The case as set forth by her was not\r\ninspiriting.\r\n\r\n“But,” said Bella at last, “why did you not tell Mr. Brownlow this? You\r\nseemed to think it all satisfactory when you were talking to him.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Brownlow!” Polly replied contemptuously. “What would be the good\r\nof telling a person like that?”\r\n\r\n“We have no one else to advise or help us, no one at all; Robert does\r\nnot know and I am sure you don’t think much of his opinion.”\r\n\r\nSeeing Bella in real consternation, Bill shut her book. It was A\r\nMIDSUMMER-NIGHT’S DREAM, recommended by Mr. Dane, and she had found a\r\ngreat delight in it during those days. “What is your plan?” she asked\r\nPolly, as she put the book away and seated herself on the table.\r\n\r\n“I cannot say I have a plan,” Polly answered slowly, “not exactly a\r\nplan,--I may not do it; it depends on several things.”\r\n\r\n“Several persons?” Bill suggested; “persons or a person?” Polly did not\r\nanswer, and Bill followed up her suspicions: “A person who you are not\r\nsure will do what you want?”\r\n\r\nPolly shifted uneasily; she seldom reckoned persons as obstacles to her\r\nplans, but in this case Bill was right, for she herself was the person\r\nin question, and Polly was not at all sure of the worth of her own\r\nauthority over her ward--she and Theresa had been appointed guardians.\r\n\r\n“It is all very perplexing,” she said with a sigh. “I hardly know what\r\nwill be best to do for you and me. It principally concerns you and me,\r\nas poor Aunt said, for Bella has a little money of her own, and, even\r\nif she does not marry, she is never likely to want a home with Theresa\r\nliving so near.”\r\n\r\n“Neither is Bill,” Bella said. “Robert has offered it to Bill; I don’t\r\nsee how you can expect him to take us both. I am very glad he has\r\noffered it to her; she wants it much more than I do.”\r\n\r\nPolly agreed. “But,” she added, “I should not think Bill would like to\r\nquarter herself on Robert and Theresa for the rest of her life; that is\r\nwhat it would amount to, for she could never be a governess and come\r\nand go as you could. It was very kind of them to offer it, but I should\r\nnot think Bill would take it, except, of course, just for the present.\r\nI know I should not.”\r\n\r\n“You will mostly take all you can get,” Bill observed not without\r\ntruth. Before Polly could deny the charge she asked: “On whom does your\r\nplan depend? Not on Bella; she evidently has nothing to do with it;\r\nhave I?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Bill,” Polly said severely; “it is for your good as well as\r\nmine. You don’t deserve to be considered, but I have a sense of\r\nresponsibility.”\r\n\r\n“What can I do that is any good to you?” Bill speculated. “What is it,\r\nPolly? Something you hardly expect me to do?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing of the sort! I should always expect you to do as I wished,\r\nespecially as I am your guardian.”\r\n\r\nAn audience of two was quite sufficient for Polly, who even when alone\r\ncould hardly refrain from taking a part. Bill knew the value of her\r\nefforts. “What is your plan?” she asked simply, and Polly, after a few\r\nmore preliminary flourishes, set it forth. Briefly it was this: to let\r\nthings remain as arranged with Mr. Brownlow until Christmas, when the\r\nlease of the house expired; then to give up the school,--sell it if\r\nthere was anything to sell--Bella to obtain a situation as resident\r\ngoverness, making Haylands her home in the holidays; Polly and Bill to\r\nmove to London or the suburbs--\r\n\r\n“And take lodgers!” cried Bill.\r\n\r\n“Yes, probably,” Polly said; “we should not have enough to live on\r\nwithout doing something, and that would be the best we could do. I have\r\nthought about boarders, but that won’t do; you want more capital for a\r\nboarding house; besides boarders are a nuisance, nor do they really pay\r\nso well as lodgers, though of course they sound much better. We need\r\nnot tell people about here that we are letting lodgings; we can say we\r\nare taking a few paying guests, because we could not get a house small\r\nenough for just our two selves.”\r\n\r\nThis plan, except for the unnecessary deception, met with Bella’s\r\nentire approval. Bill, to Polly’s annoyance, did not give an opinion,\r\nbut sat thinking, probably of what part she was to play and why she,\r\nrather than Bella, had been chosen for the venture. The same question\r\noccurred to Bella. “Why should not you and I do this?” she asked.\r\n“I should do just as well as Bill, and besides, we should have more\r\ncapital as I could put my money into it. And then there would be no\r\nneed to upset Robert’s arrangement; I am sure he really meant Bill to\r\nmake Haylands her home.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Bella”--Polly was motherly--“there are two or three reasons\r\nwhy it should not be you. To begin with, you are too pretty; our\r\nlodgers will probably be men, very likely young city men,--you\r\nunderstand? To go on with, why should not Bill be independent? If she\r\nputs her share of the money in and helps me she would be independent in\r\na measure, and I certainly know of no other way in which she could be.”\r\n\r\nBella was not altogether satisfied; but Bill was, for she had solved\r\nthe problem on her own account. “There is going to be no servant kept\r\nin that house!” she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“What nonsense!” Bella said, and Polly explained that she should\r\nhave a girl. Then they talked the plan over afresh, Bill remaining\r\naggravatingly silent. At last, Bella going into the kitchen to speak to\r\nthe maid, Polly turned angrily to the table where the small figure was\r\nalmost lost in the darkness. “I suppose,” she said sharply, “you are\r\ngoing to oppose me?”\r\n\r\nBill laughed softly. “Fancy you being afraid of me and my opposition,”\r\nshe said half to herself.\r\n\r\nPolly did not attempt to deny the fact. “You are the most obstinate,\r\ncontrary, silly little creature in the world,” was her only answer.\r\n\r\nBill seemed still more amused. “Why did you let me know you were\r\nafraid?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“What is the good of pretending?” was Polly’s only answer, and Bill\r\nquoted some past words of her cousin’s in reply. “‘Truth is a luxury\r\npoor people cannot always afford;’ I have heard you give that to\r\nsomebody as an excuse for your pretending. I don’t think it a very good\r\none myself, but I have heard you make it. I suppose you can afford to\r\nbe truthful with me?”\r\n\r\n“I am not going to pretend with you,” Polly said. “Look here, Bill, you\r\nare only a child and you are very ignorant and not at all clever,--I\r\nhope you don’t mind me saying these things, I am only telling the plain\r\ntruth--you are all this, but in some respects you have much more sense\r\nthan Bella and Theresa; you have more vitality, more--I don’t know\r\nwhat--but more backbone; you are not so much a Brownlow, not a Brownlow\r\nat all.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you.” Bill did not seem overwhelmed with the flattery.\r\n\r\n“What is your objection?” Polly asked after a pause: “I suppose you\r\nthink you would have to work too hard.”\r\n\r\n“No I don’t. Oh, no I don’t at all; we should share the work out\r\nfairly, Polly, very fairly.”\r\n\r\nJust then Bella came back, and the discussion was dropped, but Polly\r\nwas not altogether dissatisfied, concluding from Bill’s manner then,\r\nand later, that she would probably fall in with the plan when the time\r\ncame. As for Bill there was no hesitation in her mind about accepting\r\nthe proposition; there was nothing else she could do, for she could not\r\nlive with Robert and Theresa permanently, unless they would let her\r\nwork their garden for a profit and look upon the proceeds as payment\r\nfrom her. They would not let her do this, so, though she would have\r\npreferred the garden to the lodgings, she was quite willing to accept\r\nthe latter, since the former was unattainable. Live with Theresa\r\nwithout the garden she would not, for she had discovered, or rather she\r\nhad gradually come to know of certain things which led her to believe\r\nthat Theresa and Robert could not afford to offer her a permanent home.\r\n“I don’t believe Theresa knows,” she said to herself, “or if she does,\r\nshe does not realise how things are. I wonder if Robert does? He was\r\nalways telling me separate bits; I wonder if he looks at things whole;\r\nbut he must, of course he must do so.”\r\n\r\nThese thoughts occupied Bill’s mind a good deal, and another was added\r\nto them at this time, surprise at her own power over Polly. Either\r\nopenly or covertly Polly’s will had been supreme at Langford House;\r\nshe had always planned and decided for them all; it was a strange and\r\nwonderful thing that she should have considered Bill in this plan,\r\nfeared her opposition even while she sought her help--strange yet\r\nperhaps not altogether unreasonable. Bill felt a childish amusement\r\nin the novelty of the situation, and also a sense of responsibility.\r\nBut of course she had, and she knew she had, a certain compelling\r\npower over Polly, else why had she taken her to Wood Hall? Shrewd,\r\nunprincipled Polly! To be sure, Bill did not call her that: she did\r\nnot think about her principles, but, true to her nature, accepted her\r\ncousin as she found her, and never judged her at all.\r\n\r\nWhat with one thing and another Bill seemed to be fast growing older:\r\nwhen she went back to Ashelton at the end of May she felt that years\r\ninstead of weeks had elapsed since she had left it. A month makes a\r\ndifference to the country in the spring-time, and she noticed many\r\nchanges during the drive to Haylands. The grass had grown: in some of\r\nthe fields it had come up into little billows, where a patch of more\r\nfertile soil had caused some part to rise above the rest; in other\r\nfields it was all long and soft, spiked here and there with the shafts\r\nof its unopened flowers. Everywhere there were butter-cups, a golden\r\ncloth of butter-cups; everywhere hawthorn, each hedge snow-powdered\r\nwith its blossom, each thorn-bush a bride in its white veil. The earth\r\nhad been busy, Bill felt, very busy; the early fruit was set in the\r\norchard, the blossom was off the apples, the oaks fully in leaf, the\r\ncow-parsley, waist-high, made every ditch a fairy-land.\r\n\r\nIt had all changed very much, and Bill felt that she had changed too;\r\nthen she turned to the garden, and in a sudden rebound from the trouble\r\nof the past weeks forgot about herself and her changes. There was so\r\nmuch, so very much to be done, to have lost a month at this time of\r\nyear was a sad thing. She worked desperately, enthusiastically, to make\r\nup for it; and at dusk she struck work and forgot all about her age\r\nand her responsibilities, wandering forth with Shakespeare’s fairies\r\n(she knew them all by heart now) into the orchard and the fields and\r\nthe deep, grass-grown ditches almost as if she expected to find the\r\nfairy-folk there.\r\n\r\nAnd thus it was that Gilchrist Harborough found her. During her absence\r\nat Wrugglesby he had debated his problem of natural selection more than\r\nonce, and had at last decided to let matters drift. He did not phrase\r\nhis decision thus; he put it that, since he was not likely to see her\r\nagain for a long time, it was not worth thinking about it any more. So\r\nhe did not think; indeed, he thought so little that, when he saw Bill\r\nagain, he forgot the problem and never for an instant thought of her as\r\nan integral part of it, or as a practical farmer’s wife, or anything\r\nelse practical. He himself on that occasion could hardly be regarded\r\nas a practical person seeking a wife in a cool and reasonable manner.\r\nThere was no suggestion of a carefully thought out plan about it; it\r\nwas just man and woman, and the dewy fragrance of trodden grass in the\r\ndusk of an evening when May and June meet to make it neither spring nor\r\nsummer but a mid-heaven between.\r\n\r\nHe heard Bill’s curious many-noted voice as he passed down the lane\r\nwhere he had talked with her on the day they first spoke of Robert\r\nMorton. She had been in the orchard then, as she was now. She had\r\ndiscovered an echo in the orchard,--the back of some barns, the end of\r\nan old wall, something caused it; it pleased her, and she sang softly,\r\npausing to hear the repeated sound. “Fearest to love me”--and “love\r\nme” came the echo distinctly. “Love me,” she cried again to the clear\r\nrepetition, “love me--me!” answering the sound as it answered her, till\r\nthe twilight seemed filled with passionate whispering melody.\r\n\r\nHarborough stopped abruptly. If he had been wise he would have gone\r\non, but he forgot to be wise; we are none of us always wise. The old\r\nlove-song had wooed another on a summer night long ago; it held him\r\nnow, it roused something in him, and he could not go. The singer\r\nceased; she must have felt his presence, for she turned where she stood\r\nknee-deep in the coarse grasses and white-flowered weeds, and saw him\r\nleaning against the gate.\r\n\r\n“Go on,” he said; “finish it.”\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps not a polite form of greeting after her weeks of absence\r\nand trouble, but he had forgotten that; he had forgotten everything in\r\nhis desire to hear the words that he knew should follow. The natural\r\nman in him was urging him to leap the gate, to stand beside her, and to\r\nmake her say those words for him.\r\n\r\nShe hesitated in silence for a moment. In the dusk she could not see\r\nhis face very clearly, yet she must have known that the self in him to\r\nwhich she appealed was in the ascendant; she wanted to play and to make\r\nhim play, yet she was half afraid. “No,” she said standing still among\r\nthe grasses.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he answered, “yes--I will come and make you!”\r\n\r\nThen the witchcraft of the night took possession of her, and the\r\nunnamed, irresistible impulses, thought of our simple ancestry to be\r\nborn of the elfin-folk, came upon her. “Come then!” she cried.\r\n\r\nIn an instant he was over the gate, under the green twilight of the\r\napple-trees, among the grasses where she stood. But she, now wild as a\r\nkitten at evening, had fled; from the denser shadow of the nut-bushes\r\nshe called to him, yet when he reached their shade her voice came from\r\na far corner of the orchard--“Fearest to love me--fearest”--and because\r\nshe was now in the best possible position for her echo the answer came\r\nback “Fearest,” “fearest!” till it was hard to say which was the fickle\r\nvarying voice and which the repeated sound.\r\n\r\nIt was like hunting a shadow, about as easy, about as wise, but--but\r\nhe was young and she was younger still, and the earth redecked was\r\nyoung too, young with eternal youth. The fragrance of its breath was\r\nlike wine to them, the scent of the falling laburnum and lilac in the\r\ngarden, the smell of the hawthorn in the hedge, the trodden grass under\r\nfoot, the dew that was upon the ground, the wind that whispered in the\r\ndarkness of the trees. He was intoxicated with it, intoxicated with\r\nthe chase; an instinct of the days when man wooed maid with swiftness\r\nof foot and strength of arm was upon him. He was--ah, well, it did not\r\nmatter, there was no explanation; only when suddenly he startled her\r\nall unawares among the tall weeds, he completed the line which surprise\r\nhad stayed on her lips. “Fearest,” she had called thinking him far\r\naway; and “To love me?” he finished, crushing her to silence in his\r\narms.\r\n\r\nFor a moment she was still in his arms; it might have been her will, it\r\nmight not;--then, with a sudden effort she wrenched herself free, and\r\nhe was alone in the darkening orchard."

      "content": "THE COURTSHIP OF HARBOROUGH OF CROWS’ FARM.\r\n\nMan is a triple development; call him, body, soul and spirit, or\r\nmind, matter and extension,--he is, however regarded, a trinity. A\r\nman who recognises his three natures (which fortunately all do not),\r\nand who in his wife or work gratifies two of the three, is asking\r\nmuch of Providence when he complains that the third is unsatisfied.\r\nYet this was Gilchrist Harborough’s case. Mind had counselled him to\r\nseek Wilhelmina Alardy as his wife; reason pointed out her unique\r\nsuitability to his requirements; common-sense told him that she was\r\nexactly and precisely the person for all practical purposes. Yet he\r\nhad hesitated, perhaps because he had an intuitive, if unexpressed,\r\nidea that such excellent logic was not always the best foundation for\r\ndomestic happiness. That was a month ago; but then, last night in the\r\ntwilight came Matter, and, forgetting Mind’s cool selection, discovered\r\nthat the girl was desirable, sought and made her captive in a somewhat\r\nsavage fashion, asking no better reason than her voice, no stronger\r\nproof than her contact when his arms held her.\r\n\r\nYet in the morning the man was not satisfied with this double choice.\r\nTo begin with, he despised himself because he had allowed Matter to\r\nget the upper hand; as a consequence he--well, no, he did not exactly\r\ndespise the cause--but at least he did not altogether respect her just\r\nthen. “The woman tempted me,”--it was a coward’s excuse and he would\r\nnot make it. She was not to blame, at least not much; he would do her\r\njustice. And he honestly tried, though he did not altogether succeed,\r\nfor he did not understand the childish folly which had prompted her to\r\nthe game in the orchard. Sheer folly it had been, and nothing more; she\r\nknew nothing of his sensations and emotions, and his capture of her at\r\nthe end had come like a thunderclap in its stunning suddenness and left\r\nher even now not fully aware of the true state of the case.\r\n\r\nSo Harborough in his mind did her justice so far as he could; and in\r\nhis actions he determined without delay to explain his equivocal words\r\nof last night and make her a formal offer of marriage. And when he\r\nfelt not altogether glad about this decision, he reminded himself how\r\nentirely reason had chosen her before impulse had dictated last night’s\r\nwords. As for the ideal, the fair and stately woman, a queen with holy\r\nface and ways of gentle dignity,--there was not room at his hearth for\r\nher. She could not rise early to milk his cows; she could not toil and\r\nwork and stand beside him in the dirt and drudgery of his daily round;\r\nat least his queen could not, for so she would not be queen. There is\r\ndoubtless a dignity in labour, but it is not easily discernible when\r\nlabour is translated into soap and water, mud and ashes, red hands and\r\ntumbled hair. He could not afford an ideal: he did not need a woman\r\nto worship, but one to live with, human, likeable, one to work with,\r\nstrong, capable,--and he went to look for Bill.\r\n\r\nBut Bill was not easy to find; she should have been working in\r\nthe garden at this time, but from the field-path he could not see\r\nher. He retraced his steps, and from another point sought her as\r\nunsuccessfully. He climbed a little hill and looked down upon the\r\ngarden, but she was not there. Then he went back, by way of the lane,\r\nto the orchard, but she was not there either; she must have gone on\r\nsome message for Theresa: he would come again in the afternoon, and\r\nfind her then. But he did not find her, for then, as earlier, she saw\r\nhim coming and ran away to hide. She did not exactly know why; she\r\nwas afraid of what he would say, of what he had said; she did not\r\naltogether understand herself or him or anything; only she was afraid.\r\nShe longed to tell someone,--Mr. Dane--her world held no one else who\r\nwas likely to be of any use. She would have liked to tell him as she\r\ntold him of Harborough of Gurnett, but, for some reason that she could\r\nnot fathom, she was ashamed; so she only worked hard and tried not to\r\nthink, and when she saw her lover coming (if lover he was) she hid\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nBut Gilchrist Harborough was not to be turned from his purpose like\r\nthis, and, having sought her in vain the next day, he presented himself\r\nat the house in the evening and asked Jessie for Miss Alardy. It was\r\nraining, a fine soft rain, which rejoiced the heart and made things\r\nalmost grow before the eyes. Bill would be indoors now, for the rain\r\nclouds had closed the evening in early, and in the drawing-room, where\r\nhe waited, it seemed already dark.\r\n\r\nJessie went to find Bill. “She has just gone to the attic for a sieve,”\r\nTheresa said, and Jessie went up the attic-stairs. “Miss Bill!” she\r\ncalled, standing at the top and looking down the long passage from\r\nthe right of which the three attics opened. The place looked ghostly\r\nin the grey twilight; there was a spot of wet on the low ceiling, the\r\nroof leaked by the chimney where the starlings had built last year,\r\nthere was a great hole in the floor under the window, and there were\r\nrats in the attic. Jessie gathered her skirts about her, and, after a\r\npreliminary _sh-oo!_ to frighten any chance creatures that might be\r\nabout, came into the passage. “Miss Bill,” she called again, “you’re\r\nwanted; Mr. Harborough wants to see you.”\r\n\r\nNow that was precisely the information for which Bill was waiting.\r\nShe had heard the door-bell ring as she looked over some tools in the\r\nback attic, but she had not associated the sound with herself until\r\nJessie began to ascend the stairs. Then she had guessed that the\r\nvisitor was Gilchrist Harborough, and that he had come to see her. She\r\nfully intended to go down and see him; it was, of course, what she\r\nmust do, and there certainly was no reason why she should not; yet\r\nwhen she heard Jessie’s voice an uncontrollable impulse to escape took\r\npossession of her. She looked round; there was no escape, no way out\r\nbut the door by which Jessie would enter. The door of a big cupboard,\r\nhowever, stood ajar behind her; quick as thought she opened it, pulled\r\nit to after her and stood pressed against the wall within, holding the\r\ndoor close by its rough planking.\r\n\r\nJessie peeped into each of the attics in turn, and then muttering, “She\r\nain’t here after all,” went down-stairs again; but Bill remained in the\r\ncupboard till she heard the front door shut after Harborough. It was\r\nsome time, for they looked thoroughly for her before he went away. Her\r\nprison was cramped, dark, and very close, and there was a warm smell\r\nof old hops about it which afterwards she always associated with that\r\nevening and her folly. It was folly, and as such she regretted it when\r\nit was too late and would have gladly undone it if she could.\r\n\r\nLater, when she came down-stairs, Theresa told her of Harborough’s\r\nvisit and asked her where she was when they called her. She did not\r\ntell and her reply, guardedly given, left only a vague impression on\r\nher cousin’s mind. Theresa, believing she must have gone to the barn\r\nwith her tools, thought no more about it until the next afternoon when\r\nHarborough presented himself again. This time he asked for Theresa,\r\nhaving learned from Robert that his wife and Polly were left guardians\r\nof their young cousin.\r\n\r\nIt was Sunday, and by Theresa’s invitation Bella and Polly had walked\r\nfrom Wrugglesby that morning to spend the day at Haylands; they had\r\ncome early and would stay till the evening, when Robert was going to\r\ndrive them home. Polly was dozing placidly on the dining-room sofa\r\nwhen Harborough came, and Bill was curled up in the orchard with a\r\nbook, oblivious alike of impending events and the dampness of the\r\ngrass. Harborough might almost have caught her now had he tried; but\r\nhe did not, for he decided that his best plan would be to apply in the\r\nold-fashioned way to Mrs. Morton for permission to address her cousin.\r\n\r\nAccordingly he did so, and he did it with some self-possession, for the\r\nwhole thing was now very clear in his own mind and he wished to get it\r\nsettled. It was, after all, to him a very simple and straightforward\r\nmatter now.\r\n\r\nBut to Theresa it was very different, very overwhelming, it might\r\nalmost be said, in its unexpectedness. She gazed at him blankly for\r\na moment, too much astonished for speech. “Bill?” she said at last,\r\n“Bill? She is a child!”\r\n\r\n“She is young,” Harborough admitted, “but she must be nearly eighteen;\r\nthat is not so very young, you know.”\r\n\r\n“She is not eighteen till the winter; we have always looked upon her as\r\na child. You must forgive my astonishment, she seems such a child to\r\nus.”\r\n\r\nHarborough said he could easily understand her feelings; indeed, he\r\nallowed, in some respects Bill seemed a child to him, though in others\r\nthe very reverse.\r\n\r\n“She is very capable,” Theresa said, “but I am afraid when you come to\r\nspeak to her on this subject you will find her very childish,--I mean,\r\nshe will be so unprepared for it, it will be difficult.”\r\n\r\nHarborough smiled slightly. “I do not think it will be an entire\r\nsurprise to her,” he said. “I do not mean that I know how she will\r\nreceive me, but that I should come will not, I fancy, altogether\r\nastonish her.”\r\n\r\nTheresa felt more and more bewildered. “I think you must be mistaken,”\r\nwas all she could say; but he was persistent in his opinion, and\r\ncertainly, whether he was right or wrong, there was no valid reason why\r\nhe should not speak to Bill. Theresa, however, still believing in the\r\ngirl’s complete ignorance, stipulated for one thing: Bill’s decision,\r\nwhatever it was, should not be considered final. “For,” Theresa said,\r\n“I am very much afraid she will not really know her own mind.”\r\n\r\nHarborough acquiesced to this, and also to the suggestion that Polly\r\nshould be consulted. “She is here now,” Theresa told him; “perhaps it\r\nwould be better if you were to see her, as Bill is really more her\r\ncharge than mine.”\r\n\r\nHarborough had no particular wish to consult the unknown Polly, but\r\nhe could not do less than agree, so Theresa went to find her. She was\r\nstill dozing on the sofa in the dining-room, and there was no one else\r\nthere. Theresa roused her and told her the news briefly, wishing the\r\nwhile that Polly had not slept so soundly, and fearing lest she should\r\nnot fully understand. But she need have had no fears; Polly grasped the\r\nsituation completely. “Has he any money?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes, oh yes, some, not a great deal, of course; he has a little farm.\r\nBut, Polly, Bill--”\r\n\r\n“A farm? Oh, he is the man who lives by himself and does his own work\r\nto prove something, I remember. That will just suit Bill.”\r\n\r\nPolly got up, went to the glass above the mantelpiece and began to\r\narrange her front hair.\r\n\r\n“It is impossible to think of that child marrying him, of her marrying\r\nanyone yet,” Theresa protested.\r\n\r\nPolly did not think so. “I don’t see why she should not,” she said\r\ncoolly; “you may be pretty sure she has given him encouragement, or he\r\nwould not come here like this.”\r\n\r\n“That proves nothing,” said Theresa. “He does not know in the least\r\nwhether she will have him or not; he spoke to me first because she is\r\nso very young.”\r\n\r\n“Possibly, but she knows what is coming; he as good as told you so.”\r\n\r\n“He is mistaken; I am sure he is.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you whether I think so or not after I have seen him. I don’t\r\nmuch expect he is; and knowing Bill as well as I do, well--” Polly\r\nbroke off and with an impressive silence conveyed more than words could.\r\n\r\nTheresa did not altogether believe her, but she felt that she herself\r\nwas far from understanding Bill. “At all events,” she said, “I told him\r\nhe could speak to her. There is nothing against him as far as I know,\r\nand whatever she says now is not to be considered absolutely binding.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” Polly stopped abruptly to ask the question as she\r\nwas opening the door.\r\n\r\n“I mean,” Theresa answered, “that if she accepts him she is not to be\r\nconsidered engaged; she shall be free to change her mind if she likes,\r\nfor I am sure she cannot really know anything about it.”\r\n\r\n“Not to be engaged?” Polly repeated. “Is it to be kept private? No one\r\nis to be told, we are to have no hold over him?”\r\n\r\n“I will not have her bound; it is not right,--you can’t think it right.”\r\n\r\nTheresa was surprised at Polly’s manner, and still more surprised when\r\nshe turned upon her in low-voiced wrath,--“You idiot!” she said.\r\n\r\n“Polly!” Theresa exclaimed reddening, and then added: “I will not have\r\nit; mind, I will not have her bound!”\r\n\r\nAnd then the two passed into the drawing-room. Polly was affability\r\nitself; she spoke of “dear little Wilhelmina’s” youth, and of her own\r\nsurprise, but held out some hopes of success to Harborough, who did not\r\naltogether trust her, though owing to her skill he did not distrust her\r\nas much as might have been expected. Nothing was said about Theresa’s\r\ncondition, except that as Harborough was leaving she repeated it, and\r\nPolly, unable to do anything else, seconded her.\r\n\r\n“I expect he wanted to see Bill this afternoon,” Theresa said when he\r\nhad gone.\r\n\r\n“I expect he did,” Polly replied; “but I want to see her first. I mean\r\nto know what she has been doing.”\r\n\r\n“What she intends to do,” was also part of Polly’s meaning, and she set\r\noff at once to the orchard, feeling the remainder of the afternoon was\r\nall too short for her investigations.\r\n\r\n“Bill,” she said, sitting down beside her cousin on a cushion she had\r\nbrought for the purpose, “Bill, what about Mr. Harborough?” Polly\r\nwasted no time over preliminaries. “The Mr. Harborough who lives here,\r\nI mean.”\r\n\r\n“What about him?” Bill inquired, looking up from her book.\r\n\r\nPolly closed the book for her. “Yes, what?” she said. “When and where\r\nhave you seen him?”\r\n\r\n“Oh in lots of places,--why? He does not belong to Wood Hall.”\r\n\r\n“I know that. Bill,” she added suddenly, “has he been making love to\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\nThen the time had come; Bill felt it intuitively and braced herself to\r\nmeet it. But for the life of her she would have found it hard to say\r\nwhether he had or had not committed the offence in question. She would\r\nnot permit herself to do more than ask cautiously, “Why?”\r\n\r\n“He has!” Polly exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m not sure;” and Bill so evidently meant what she said that\r\nPolly for a moment was nonplussed. “He has been here this afternoon,”\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\n“To see me?” Bill asked, and Polly felt that was something of an\r\nadmission. “No,” she answered, “to see Theresa and me about you.”\r\n\r\n“Whatever for?”\r\n\r\n“To ask our permission--”\r\n\r\n“To make love to me?” At first the idea struck Bill as comical, but its\r\ngravity soon came home to her.\r\n\r\n“I suppose you think that absurd,” Polly said, “since he has already\r\ndone it without our permission; and he has done it, Bill, or something\r\nvery like it. It is no use denying it; something must have happened,\r\nsomething fairly pronounced, before a man of his stamp would come to\r\nTheresa and me as he came this afternoon. You must have given him very\r\ndirect encouragement.”\r\n\r\nPolly paused for Bill to deny the charge, but the denial did not come;\r\nthe girl sat silently considering the matter, tearing a leaf to pieces\r\nas she did so.\r\n\r\n“Well?” Polly said at last interrogatively.\r\n\r\n“Did he tell you I had encouraged him? I mean, did he absolutely say\r\nso? I shall ask him myself if I think you are deceiving me.”\r\n\r\nPolly thought it very likely that she would do so, and accordingly\r\nmade answer: “No, of course he did not say so in so many words, but\r\nhis coming to us showed it; besides he told Theresa, when she said you\r\nwould be astonished, that he did not think you would be, that he had\r\nreason to believe you expected him.” _Not be surprised to see him_ and\r\n_expected him_ were convertible, if not synonymous, terms.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” was Bill’s only answer.\r\n\r\n“Did you expect him?” Polly demanded.\r\n\r\n“I suppose I did; I don’t know.”\r\n\r\n“You must know what you expect if you are not absolutely stupid, and\r\nyou might as well be honest about it; some people would have a good\r\ndeal to say about your underhand dealings.”\r\n\r\nBill suggested that her cousin should say all she wished on the\r\nsubject, but Polly, regarding it as a waste of time, went on to observe\r\nwith dignity: “I don’t want to inquire into your actions nor yet your\r\nintentions, but all I can say is that you have made an honourable\r\nman,--a good man, Bill--believe you care for him; and if you do not, if\r\nyou mean nothing, you must settle the matter with him.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe you!” Bill exclaimed. “I ran away from him, though I\r\ndid tell him to come--I was only in fun--he hardly held--”\r\n\r\nShe broke off, feeling that she could not lay the matter bare to her\r\ncousin. Polly was disappointed at the confession ending so abruptly,\r\nbut she only said: “Tell him you were only in fun. If he knew you\r\nas well as I do he might not be surprised at such a questionable\r\nproceeding; but as he loves you, I am afraid it will be rather a shock\r\nto him.”\r\n\r\n“Loves me!--he loves me!” Bill repeated the words gently, her whole\r\nface softening. She had not thought of this before. She had such high,\r\nidyllic notions of love, hardly definite notions at all, only a feeling\r\nthat it was very great and supreme and far removed from her own life.\r\n\r\n“Of course he does,” Polly said, surprised at having touched an\r\nanswering chord here, “else why should he want to marry you? You have\r\nnothing to recommend you.”\r\n\r\n“No,” Bill admitted, “no, I have not. How strange that he should want\r\nto marry me,--how strange and wonderful!”\r\n\r\nShe sat looking across the orchard, her eyes filled with a great\r\nshining, her heart thrilled with gratitude to one who could love her.\r\nFor herself, she did not know; his emotion would arouse an answering\r\nemotion in her; if he loved her she could not choose but love him, just\r\nas when he held her she could not choose but stay for just a moment.\r\nShe was very humble and submissive in heart just then.\r\n\r\nOn the whole Polly was well satisfied with her talk. Bill would accept\r\nHarborough. Two things were in his favour, the girl’s joy and pride\r\nin this, the first love offered to her, her innocence of life and all\r\nit held, and also her curious, one-sided sense of honour. The first,\r\naided by her oddly sympathetic, almost reflective, nature, would make\r\nher wish to accept the lover; the second, aided by Polly’s statement of\r\nthe case, would make it impossible for her to refuse the man. So Polly\r\nwas satisfied that Bill would marry Harborough; probably next summer,\r\nas Theresa would not allow it before then, and Polly herself did not\r\nwish it. She wanted to begin her lodging-venture in the winter, and,\r\nthough she would take Bella into partnership when Bill was married,\r\nshe would prefer to have the younger cousin at the beginning of the\r\nenterprise. She considered that Bill was now settled for life, her\r\nfuture assured in a most unexpected fashion. Harborough, she judged,\r\nwas the sort of man she could depend upon to do his duty by his wife,\r\nand in spite of Theresa’s words, she would take care that at least a\r\nlittle of the arrangement was known to a few mutual friends. In this\r\nlaudable intention, however, she was eventually frustrated by Bill.\r\nShe had reckoned that Bill would see no reason for secrecy; being sure\r\nof herself, whatever motives ruled her decision now would rule it in\r\na year’s time, and so she would oppose Theresa. But she did no such\r\nthing, not because she objected to publicity or saw any reason against\r\nit, but because Polly was in favour of it and Theresa against it.\r\n\r\n“It may be wise,” she said to Polly, “if you urge it, but if Theresa\r\ndoes it is right; in this I would rather do what is right than wise.”\r\n\r\nIn vain Polly pointed out the wisdom, and explained that publicity was\r\nthe only hold they had. Bill retorted haughtily that she wished for no\r\nhold, and went on to add that, if any rumour of her affairs should get\r\nabout, she should consider Polly the culprit, and behave accordingly.\r\nAnd Polly, having an inward conviction that she would keep her word in\r\nsome unpleasant way, was obliged to remain silent.\r\n\r\nOn that same Sunday evening, when Harborough spoke to the cousins, came\r\nTheresa to Bill’s room after she had gone to bed, and kissed her and\r\ncried over her and asked her if she really loved him. And Bill flung\r\nher arms round the young wife’s neck, almost suffocating her in the\r\nwealth of her hair, and said she did not know, feeling vaguely sorry\r\nfor Theresa, and wondering if loving and being loved always brought\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nAll the next day she was quiet and subdued, and in the evening the time\r\ncame. She went into the orchard, thinking it likely that he would come\r\ndown the lane to her. He did come; he saw her, and jumped the gate and\r\ncame to her as she stood in the soft grass, her heart beating, a shy\r\nfearing happiness in her half-awakened soul. He came to her striding\r\nover the grass in the twilight of the apple-trees; but he did not\r\nknow the tumult in her breast, did not recognise the half-awakened\r\nwomanhood. He was not to-night, as once before, the strong man wooing\r\nthe maid, nor was he the lover come to claim a girl’s heart. He came\r\nto ask her to be his wife because he believed it right to do so,\r\nbecause he believed it wise, because he thought for all practical\r\npurposes she was the woman best suited to his needs. He had desired\r\nher, it is true, but to-night it was not desire, not impulse; it was\r\na deliberate plan, the wise performance of a wise act. But it lacked\r\nfire, lacked it woefully. And she, who shyly lifted shining eyes to\r\nthose of the sober lover, could not kindle it; nay, she herself was not\r\nthe same as the alluring shadow of the other night. He did not love the\r\nwoman; the elf-child fascinated him, the housewife pleased him, but\r\nthe woman he did not recognise. The best of his nature was untouched\r\nby her; he knew that he did not in the highest sense love her, and he\r\ndid not pretend that he did. But, the pity was she thought he did; they\r\nhad told her so, and, after all, as _to love_ is often translated into\r\ndaily life, perhaps they were right, though in her idyllic, almost\r\nchildish rendering of the word, they were entirely and hopelessly wrong.\r\n\r\nSo the question was asked and answered under the lichen-covered\r\nbranches; coolly, dispassionately, yet withal gently he asked; shyly\r\nshe answered, not yet aware of the lack in it all. She was so ignorant,\r\nwhat should she know of love’s ways? So awed, she could not criticise\r\nhis words, so subdued and humble she could not doubt him. Thus she\r\ngave her word not knowing, stood awhile under the trees a little\r\ndisappointed but not yet aware, and bade him good-bye with only a\r\nhalf-wakened doubt.\r\n\r\nHe left her, thinking perhaps she would prefer to see her cousin alone\r\nfirst, refusing her invitation to come to the house from a sense of\r\ndelicacy. She did not know his reason, but she was vaguely glad\r\nhe refused. They walked together to the gate, talking ordinarily,\r\nrationally, his manner as usual, hers as calm as it was reflective\r\nof his. There was no passion, no shyness; it would not have been\r\nembarrassing to meet Theresa, though she was glad they were not going\r\nto meet her. Glad, too, she was, consciously glad that he was going;\r\nshe wanted him to go,--she hated to have him there--she was beginning\r\nto realise the lack in it all.\r\n\r\nThey parted at the orchard-gate; the first wild roses were opening,\r\ntheir fragrance filled the air, a spray showed faintly pink against\r\nthe girl’s hair as she leaned over the gate. Something in the scent\r\nand the face, half seen in the twilight, stirred Harborough; he made\r\nan impulsive movement, but he had himself well in hand that night, and\r\nthe impulse ended in nothing more than stooping to kiss her without\r\nany demonstration of emotion. So he bade her good-bye and went, she\r\nstanding to watch him till he was lost in the dusk of the summer night,\r\nstanding to watch him quite calmly though her breast heaved, until he\r\nwas out of sight; then with a movement of passionate rage she wiped the\r\nkiss from her face and flung the handkerchief into the hedge.\r\n\r\n“He did not make love to me a little bit!” she wailed. “‘Will you marry\r\nme?’ ‘Will you scrub the floor?’ It might as well have been one as the\r\nother. ‘Can you make butter?’ ‘Can you love me?’ Can I? I could hate\r\nyou! How I shall hate you, if you don’t take care!”\r\n\r\nThere was someone talking in the garden, Theresa and Robert perhaps;\r\nshe almost thought it was, and fearful of discovery crept into the\r\ndeep dry ditch and lay hid among the tall stalks of the cow-parsley.\r\nIn that green darkness she sobbed out her grief for the loss of her\r\ndream, the dream of loving and being loved which comes to all women\r\nat some time. It had come to her only yesterday; it had died unborn\r\nto-day,--unborn, for she did not love the man; had he loved her, or\r\nhad he wooed her with the passion of the other night, her responsive\r\nnature might have replied, or at least she would have thought it did.\r\nBut he had not done so, and the thing was only a dream; loving and\r\nbeing loved,--both must be mourned as never known, both buried together\r\nin the twilight of the white-flowered weeds. Nevertheless she was in\r\nhonour bound to the man, that curious, distorted, inviolable law of\r\nhonour which she had from some ancestry and could not break. The spoken\r\nword must be fulfilled, the unspoken pledge redeemed, the unconscious\r\nencouragement, of which Polly had made so much, justified. Polly had\r\ndone well to trust to this other bond."

      "content": "FAMILY HISTORY.\r\n\nMr. Wagnall was an antiquary, avowedly an antiquary. A man of means and\r\nleisure, he had ample time to devote to his subject, and so well had\r\nhe devoted it that there was unknown to him little that was strange in\r\nfamily tradition and village history throughout the Eastern Counties,\r\nwhich, as his birthplace and home, were the principal scenes of his\r\nresearch. He never studied architecture or building to any great\r\nextent; churches, Druidical stones, and Roman remains had little charm\r\nfor him; the land and those who owned it chiefly claimed his attention.\r\nHe had at one time intended to follow the profession of the law, and\r\nhad spent his earlier days in a solicitor’s office; it was this early\r\ntraining, possibly, which gave him his taste for family histories and\r\ninvolved land tenures. One other thing he owed to it,--and that was of\r\nmore obvious value than his love of land-lore--a friend, in the person\r\nof a former fellow-student now developed into Stevens, solicitor of\r\nWrugglesby, consulted by Mr. Johnson on the subject of the Harborough\r\nchapel and the service held therein.\r\n\r\nNow and again Mr. Wagnall visited his friend at Wrugglesby, and it\r\nhappened that this very subject of the Harborough chapel and service\r\nbrought him there at the time that Gilchrist Harborough was arranging\r\nhis matrimonial affairs at Ashelton. About this time Mr. Stevens,\r\nremembering that he had not seen his friend lately, wrote to invite\r\nhim to the little town, at the same time mentioning such affairs of\r\ninterest as had recently taken place. The Harborough service was not a\r\nrecent event, but he had not written since it occurred, and, knowing\r\nhis friend’s love of such things, he used it, and the chance of\r\ninvestigating it, as an inducement to his friend to visit Wrugglesby.\r\nEvents justified his expectations; Mr. Wagnall accepted his invitation,\r\ncame to Wrugglesby at the earliest possible date, and plagued his\r\nhost with questions, seeking information about “this most interesting\r\nrevival.”\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens was obliged to confess himself not very well informed on\r\nthe subject, but in a happy moment Mrs. Stevens thought of inviting\r\nMr. and Mrs. Johnson to meet the antiquary. She had no notion of\r\nsatisfying his thirst for information, her idea being solely to give\r\nan entertainment. She was a lady of aspiring mind, and longed for\r\nsociety on other lines than those obtainable at the solemn dinners and\r\nmore humble teas which were in vogue in Wrugglesby. Mr. Johnson was\r\nparticularly flattered by the pointed way in which Mr. Wagnall singled\r\nhim out for conversation, and the interest with which he listened to\r\nall he had to say about the Harborough chapel and service. Considering\r\nthe warmth his feelings still retained on these subjects, he was\r\na little disappointed to find his patient listener of the opinion\r\nthat the family had a right to hold a service in their own chapel,\r\naccording to their professed religion, even during the time of morning\r\nprayer.\r\n\r\n“Mind, I do not say they have a legal right,” the antiquary said,\r\n“though I am of opinion it would be difficult to get a decision\r\nagainst them; but whatever their legal right, they have a moral right,\r\nmost decidedly a moral right. I think your rector was wise in his\r\ndetermination to take no steps in the matter; it is not an occurrence\r\nlikely to be repeated. It has not been done within anyone’s memory\r\nuntil this time; it has not been repeated since then, and take my word\r\nfor it, sir, it never will be. It was done to revive an old right, my\r\ndear sir, that is what it was done for, to revive an old right and\r\nestablish a claim; an old family does not like to let its traditions\r\nlapse entirely.”\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson thought this was a very probable explanation of the\r\n“outrage,” though, as he pointed out, there was no necessity for the\r\nmass to have been said during morning-service; the claim could have\r\nbeen established without that.\r\n\r\n“Well, yes, yes,” Mr. Wagnall admitted; “still it would hardly have\r\nbeen so emphatic; no, under those circumstances, it would not have been\r\nso emphatic.”\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson again agreed with him. He also asked Mr. Wagnall if he\r\nwould care to walk over some day and have a look at the Harborough\r\nchapel, offering to act as cicerone should he do so. Mr. Wagnall\r\naccepted the offer with pleasure, and from that they got to talking\r\nabout the Harboroughs and their family history, with which Mr. Wagnall\r\nwas very well acquainted, though he did not attempt to set the\r\nclergyman right even when he gave sundry strange pieces of information\r\nabout them. There was, however, one piece of information given\r\nwhich was both new and interesting to Mr. Wagnall,--the existence of\r\nGilchrist Harborough of Crows’ Farm.\r\n\r\n“A member of the family he--” “may be,” Mr. Johnson was going to say,\r\npreparatory to enlarging upon his nature and pursuits, but Mr. Wagnall\r\ncut him short.\r\n\r\n“Of course he is a member of the family,” he said; “Gilchrist is a\r\nfamily name, the next heir to the property is a Gilchrist. You would\r\nnot get Gilchrist and Harborough in combination without some connection\r\nwith the old stock.”\r\n\r\n“Just so,” said Mr. Johnson, “just so, a member of the family, although\r\nhe comes from Australia; a younger branch, I have heard it suggested,\r\nthough he claims no connection with the Harboroughs of Gurnett.”\r\n\r\n“_Not_ a younger branch,” Mr. Wagnall’s tone was emphatic; “_not_ a\r\nyounger branch, or he could claim something more than a connection.”\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Mr. Johnson’s further enlightenment the conversation\r\nwas interrupted here, not to be resumed again that evening, and he had\r\nto content himself with waiting to hear more until Mr. Wagnall should\r\ncome to Ashelton. But Mr. Wagnall did not have to wait so long for his\r\nenlightenment, for he questioned his host at the earliest opportunity.\r\nFrom him he learnt little, for Mr. Stevens was not professionally\r\nconnected with Harborough of Gurnett, although he had sometimes done\r\na little legal work for the agent during the master’s long absences\r\nabroad. Owing to this he knew something of the affairs of the estate,\r\nand, like most people in the neighbourhood, he also knew the name,\r\nage, and whereabouts of the next heir, and sundry of the reports\r\nconcerning Mr. Harborough besides. But of Harborough of Crows’ Farm he\r\nknew little, except that he was an Australian with a theory, that he\r\nworked his own farm, and that he himself had been favourably impressed\r\nby the young man on the occasion when he had personally come across\r\nhim. “But,” he concluded, “I shouldn’t wonder if he was in at the\r\noffice to-morrow as it is market-day. He is thinking of buying a bit\r\nof meadow which cuts into his land, and I should not wonder if he were\r\nto look in during the afternoon to see me about it. You might drop in\r\nand meet him if you like; but I tell you beforehand that he won’t repay\r\ninvestigation or appreciate it either, and he certainly won’t know\r\nanything about the affair of the mass.”\r\n\r\nMr. Wagnall was by no means discouraged, and determined to look in at\r\nthe office on Thursday afternoon in case the lawyer’s anticipation\r\nproved correct. It did so: Harborough presented himself somewhere\r\nabout four o’clock, and almost before his business was discussed, Mr.\r\nWagnall also presented himself and was duly introduced to the younger\r\nman as one interested in antiquities in general and family histories\r\nin particular. Harborough himself had small interest in such things,\r\nbut he was quite willing to sympathise with another, and obligingly\r\ngave all the information he could concerning himself and his family.\r\nOf the Harboroughs of Gurnett, their history and chapel, he knew even\r\nless than Mr. Johnson, but of himself and his own people he told all he\r\ncould.\r\n\r\n“But,” he asked, “what purpose does it serve? We are a long way from\r\nthis part of the family, a younger branch who emigrated years ago.”\r\n\r\n“If you are a younger branch in direct line, if you can prove such a\r\nthing,--and I cannot help saying I think it would be difficult--it\r\nwould be--very interesting.”\r\n\r\n“Why? Is there no younger branch? You mean to say you think we come of\r\nbastard stock?”\r\n\r\n“No, oh dear no, not at all, not necessarily. Only the Harboroughs used\r\nto hold their estates according to an old tenure by which the property\r\ngoes to the youngest instead of the eldest son, and if you really were\r\nthe representative of a younger branch than those in possession--”\r\n\r\n“I could claim?”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense,” the lawyer here broke in, “the Harboroughs have given up\r\nthat manner of succession for several generations.”\r\n\r\n“It could be revived,” Mr. Wagnall suggested; “it would be interesting\r\nto revive it, as interesting as reviving the right to hold service in\r\nthe chapel.”\r\n\r\n“Interesting from an antiquarian point of view it might be,” Mr.\r\nStevens observed drily; “but Mr. Harborough here would find it an\r\nexpensive form of amusement. Old Mr. Harborough has been in possession\r\nat Wood Hall for over fifty years, and it would take something\r\nconsiderable to turn him out now. Why, bless you, my friend, if I had\r\nsquatted unmolested at Wood Hall for all those years you would find\r\nit difficult to turn me out, though I had not a shadow of right to\r\nthe place originally. Possession is rather more than nine points of\r\nthe law if you only have it long enough; whatever the weakness of old\r\nHarborough’s original claim you would find it a tough and expensive job\r\nto make your own good now.”\r\n\r\nGilchrist Harborough laughed at the lawyer’s warmth. “I was not\r\nthinking of making a claim,” he said; “I would rather invest my surplus\r\ncash in other and more profitable ways than fighting for encumbered\r\nestates.”\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens applauded such a decision. “Quite right,” he said, “quite\r\nright, though the estate is hardly so much encumbered as people think;\r\nof late years old Harborough has lived carefully, and things are not\r\nso bad as they are made out to be. I don’t mean to say the place is\r\nfree; it is not, and no doubt the next man will get into a worse state\r\nthan ever, for they are all alike, an extravagant lot. But I believe a\r\ncareful man with a little capital and reasonable ideas, in fact not a\r\nHarborough--beg pardon, I was not thinking of you--might do a good deal\r\ntowards getting things straight.”\r\n\r\n“You think so?” Harborough asked. “They have got to get their\r\nreasonable man first, and they don’t seem great at producing such\r\narticles. As for me, I don’t belong to them; and if I did I don’t\r\nknow that I can lay claim to all your requirements, small capital and\r\nreasonable ideas as well. At any rate, I don’t think I am the man for\r\nthe job; it does not seem that I am within measurable distance of the\r\nbase of operations.”\r\n\r\nHe turned to Mr. Wagnall as he spoke, but the lawyer answered for him.\r\n“No, no, certainly not,” he said; but Mr. Wagnall asked: “Are you\r\nsure that your family is a younger branch? May it not be an elder,\r\nbut, owing to the fact that the idea of disqualification is usually\r\nassociated with the younger ones, you have in the course of time come\r\nto consider yourself as such?”\r\n\r\nHarborough allowed this to be possible, though he hardly thought it\r\nthe case. Mr. Wagnall hardly thought it likely either. “So far as I\r\nknow anything about the family,” he said, “it is not very likely, the\r\nHarboroughs have not been such a prolific family that the elder and\r\nyounger ones need be confused. There never have been many of them;\r\nthe heads of the house, as a rule, lived hard and died young, their\r\nlegitimate children have been few in number. Indeed,” the antiquary\r\nwent on turning to Stevens, “when you say the old manner of succession\r\nhas fallen into disuse you are hardly doing them justice, for there has\r\nnot been much choice lately. The family is practically extinct when\r\nthe old man dies; he has no children living; the heir is the grandson\r\nof his only sister, not a Harborough at all except that he has been\r\ngiven the name. He is an only son, too, the sole representative of\r\nthe younger generation,--strange how these old families seem to wear\r\nthemselves out.”\r\n\r\nGilchrist Harborough did not think it strange at all, neither did he\r\nthink it to be regretted; the only thing which surprised him in the\r\nmatter was the interest felt in them and the detailed record kept of\r\ntheir history. “It is not as if they were anything much,” he said,\r\n“or had done anything much; they are only twopenny-halfpenny country\r\nsquires who have never done anything worth remembering; in fact, the\r\nonly thing which can be said about them is that they have been a\r\nlittle more rich and a good deal less respectable than their yeoman\r\nneighbours.”\r\n\r\nSuch a view was not likely to commend itself to the antiquary, but\r\nas he was unable to make his own view any more commendable to young\r\nHarborough, he had to content himself with admitting the family under\r\ndiscussion to be country squires, and to have been country squires so\r\nlong that they counted themselves at least the equals of the newer\r\nnobility; and moreover to have kept their own records and traditions\r\nwith jealous care from the days when their manor was first granted to\r\nthem, at which time, doubtless, they were far other than they now were\r\nin the days of their decadence.\r\n\r\n“If the records are kept with such care,” Harborough observed, “it\r\nshould be easy to see where I come in, if come in I do.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Mr. Wagnall agreed; “I can put my finger on the only spot where\r\nat all recently we can expect to find that your people joined the\r\ncommon stock. I know something about the Harborough history; I was\r\nenabled through the good offices of a friend to study it at the time\r\nthat I was writing my little volume on EAST ANGLIAN HEIRSHIPS. You have\r\nperhaps seen the book? It was noticed in several of the papers.”\r\n\r\nHarborough had not seen it, and it is to be feared he was less\r\ninterested in it than in the family history. Mr. Stevens, seeing that\r\nhis friend was now well mounted on his hobby, suggested that he and his\r\nlistener should go into the private room, and leave the office clear\r\nfor other visitors.\r\n\r\nHe half regretted being obliged to do so, for he felt he was giving\r\nthe elder man an admirable opportunity for firing the imagination and\r\nambition of the younger. Still, as the kind-hearted lawyer reflected,\r\nthe young Australian was a cool and well-balanced individual, with\r\na not too exalted opinion of the value of landed property and old\r\nfamilies to depreciate his idea of the prize at stake. “He won’t take\r\nfire like a young fellow from about here,” thought the lawyer, “but if\r\nhe does he’ll fight and fight to the end.” And again he wished he could\r\nhave prevented this unearthing of family history. But it was too late,\r\nas he found when, after the young man had gone, he asked the elder one\r\nwhat had passed.\r\n\r\n“He was very interested, very interested indeed,” Mr. Wagnall said. “He\r\nseems to think it highly probable that he derives from the Gilchrist\r\nHarborough who turned Protestant and left England in 1843.”\r\n\r\n“In 1843,” the lawyer said raising his eyebrows; “that brings it very\r\nnear.”\r\n\r\n“Very near indeed,” Mr. Wagnall replied with satisfaction; “but so he\r\nseems to think.”\r\n\r\n“Seems to think,” Stevens repeated; “that is not worth much.”\r\n\r\n“To think that he is legitimately derived I should have said; he is\r\npositive that he is derived, he has excellent reasons for thinking so;\r\nit is a mere question of legitimacy.”\r\n\r\n“It often is with these respectable old families,” Stevens observed\r\ndrily. “What did you want to put all these ideas in his head for? You\r\nhad much better have left him alone.”\r\n\r\nMr. Wagnall did not think so; he considered the whole subject most\r\ninteresting, and, as he pointed out, there was a good deal of\r\ninformation he could not have obtained without this talk with young\r\nHarborough.\r\n\r\n“Who,” Mr. Stevens said, “naturally does not regard the matter in the\r\nsame placid way in which you do, seeing that he has a personal interest\r\nin it. By Jove, though, if it is as you say, and he can prove the\r\nlegitimacy, he would have a good case, a very good case indeed. But he\r\nwon’t be able to prove it, sure not,--he would have an infernally good\r\ncase if he could!”\r\n\r\nFrom a purely legal point of view the subject had less interest for Mr.\r\nWagnall, who had no particular desire that the right man should come\r\nto his own; and in spite of a genial nature, he felt small compunction\r\nabout the trouble which might possibly arise from his investigations.\r\n\r\n“A nice hornet’s nest you are likely to have routed out,” said Mr.\r\nStevens, who was differently constituted, “and a nice squabble there\r\nwill be! If Harborough of Crows’ Farm waits till the old man dies (and\r\nthe chances are he won’t last another winter), I should say it will be\r\na bad look-out for young Kit Harborough. Not that the place is worth\r\nsuch a great deal, and I dare say he would muddle it if he got it; but\r\nit is hard to lose what you have always looked upon as your own. The\r\nAustralian--” the lawyer laughed a little--“he’s the man I described\r\nafter all, the man with a little capital and reasonable ideas. He might\r\npull the place round, cut down the timber, put some of the park-land\r\nunder cultivation, drive the plough--”\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Wagnall cried out in dismay at such impossible barbarity.\r\nNevertheless it was exactly what Gilchrist Harborough was thinking as\r\nhe drove home by way of Gurnett, and looked thoughtfully at the woods\r\nand broad park-lands which surrounded the hall. It was exactly too what\r\nhe said to Bill in the orchard on the next Sunday afternoon."

      "content": "A GRANDFATHER.\r\n\nIt was now three weeks since the day when Gilchrist Harborough came\r\nto see Theresa and Polly, three weeks since they told Bill he loved\r\nher, almost three weeks since she found out what they meant by love\r\nand buried her dream among the tall weeds in the orchard-ditch. The\r\ngrass was long in the orchard now, its flowers were covered in seed,\r\nbrown and yellow and purple dust blowing off at the lightest breath.\r\nThe leaves on the trees were thick, so thick that when one looked up it\r\nseemed an unbroken roof of green. The year had grown older, much older,\r\nit was the first maturity of summer; the light was the warmer light\r\nof summer, the shadows the slow-moving shadows of summer; the scents,\r\nricher, fuller, were the scents of summer,--the pink briar-roses in the\r\nhedge, the wreath of honeysuckle from the tree, the hay half cut in the\r\nfield beyond the lane. Spring had gone, and even if its indescribable\r\nfreshness and youth were missing one could hardly ask for anything more\r\nthan summer.\r\n\r\nBill’s was a supremely contented disposition; after her one outburst on\r\nthe night when Harborough did not make love to her she accepted fate\r\nresignedly. There was, as she herself had said, always to get up and\r\nhave breakfast next morning even after a tragedy, and she was herself\r\nwhat in domestic parlance is called “a good getter up.” So in the early\r\nmorning after Harborough’s formal offer of marriage, she thought the\r\nmatter out and put it on a reasonable basis.\r\n\r\nIt is true he did not love her in the superlative and ideal way she had\r\nimagined, but then neither did other people seem to love in that way.\r\nShe thought over the married couples of her acquaintance, and came to\r\nthe conclusion that they loved each other after a fashion. Harborough\r\nmust have loved her in a fashion, too, or else why had he sought to\r\nmarry her, seeing how little she had to commend her? Yes, he must\r\nhave loved her, even though he did not make love to her that night.\r\nThere were two of him, she knew, and she also knew that she sometimes\r\nappealed to one of the two, the one that made love, the lesser and\r\nweaker part of his nature. Under these circumstances she had reason to\r\nbe glad that the other part, the cleverer, more dominant part, liked\r\nher well enough to ask her to be his wife. On the whole she did not\r\nfind the situation impossible. Why should she? Her limited experience\r\nshowed her no better things; her sunny philosophy led her to take the\r\nworld as she found it, teaching her to judge it according to a more\r\nlenient and elastic standard than any ideal one. It is true that she\r\ndid not in the present case quite extend this tolerance to Harborough;\r\nperhaps she unconsciously gauged his nature, and, measuring it by his\r\nown standards, found his love wanting.\r\n\r\nBut on the whole she was moderately content, and certainly there was no\r\npossibility of avoiding the contract; honour demanded its fulfilment,\r\nand since it was unavoidable Bill was not likely to dwell on the dark\r\nside. She was pre-eminently of that nature which, when its hopes\r\nare wrecked, makes a fire of the drift-wood to warm itself and its\r\nfriends. Moreover, let it be remembered, to supreme ignorance and a\r\nsunny temperament the life marked out did not seem an unendurable one.\r\n“Besides,” so she had concluded her reflections that morning when she\r\nfaced facts, “there will be the farm and the dairy and heaps to do.”\r\n\r\nSo Bill accepted matters, and she and Harborough established themselves\r\non an easy and friendly footing in which love-making played but a\r\nsmall part. Theresa thought them an extraordinarily prosaic and\r\nmatter-of-fact couple, but it suited Harborough well enough; he did\r\nnot, as a rule, want to make love to Bill, and she did not now want\r\nhim to make love to her; in fact, she would not now meet any of his\r\novertures, and had a curiously wayward but uncompromising way of\r\nreceiving his occasional tendernesses. Even in these early days he\r\nfound there was a tantalising, untamed trait in her nature with which\r\nit would be hard to deal, and yet which constantly attracted while it\r\nannoyed him. He felt once or twice that he should like to come to close\r\nquarters with and understand it, even as he had come to close quarters\r\non the night when he chased her like a shadow; but the moment for that\r\nwas passed, and he could not recapture it; the shadow always eluded\r\nhim now. This feeling occasionally troubled him, but not often, and in\r\nother respects he was satisfied. It was as a matter of course that he\r\nturned his steps to the orchard that Sunday afternoon, and as a matter\r\nof course he told Bill of Mr. Wagnall’s words and the extraordinary\r\npossibilities they presented.\r\n\r\nBill listened with absorbed attention. Wood Hall, and all that\r\nconcerned it, had a great fascination for her, but she could hardly\r\nrealise that his words contained a bare chance of its coming within her\r\nown reach.\r\n\r\n“You don’t mean to say,” she said at last, “that there is any way by\r\nwhich you could claim?”\r\n\r\n“I am not sure,” Harborough answered cautiously, anxious not to\r\nencourage the building of any castles in the air.\r\n\r\n“Tell me what you mean then,” she said, and he explained the case as\r\nclearly as he could.\r\n\r\n“My grandfather,” he said, “is the nearest we can get to the\r\nHarboroughs of Gurnett; he was called Gilchrist as I am, and was the\r\nmiddle one of three brothers. About the year 1843 he quarrelled with\r\nhis family and left England; I think he turned Protestant.”\r\n\r\n“He must have had convictions; I wonder if he was like you,” Bill\r\nobserved under her breath with a particularly provoking look; but\r\nHarborough ignored the remark and went on with his history.\r\n\r\n“Part of this,” he said, “I heard from Mr. Wagnall on Thursday, part I\r\nknew before. I have always been told that my grandfather left England\r\non account of a quarrel; the story was usually told me as a warning\r\nagainst quarrelling, but I don’t know that it made much impression.\r\nWhat he did after he left England I do not know, travelled a bit I\r\nthink at first, and then the next year he married in Paris. But his\r\nwife’s family, though they were living in France, were English; indeed\r\nit was from my grandmother, who knew this part of the country, that we\r\nhad the tradition of our people. She does not seem to have known much\r\nabout them; my father always said she was vague in her tales, and never\r\nknew anything personally of her husband’s relations. My grandfather\r\ndied the same year that he married and before his son was born; my\r\ngrandmother continued to live on in Paris with her own people, teaching\r\nEnglish, I think, for she must have been poor from what my father said.”\r\n\r\n“And he?” Bill asked.\r\n\r\n“Lived in Paris too till he was about nineteen when, my grandmother\r\nbeing dead, he emigrated to Australia with a notion of gold-mining. At\r\nfirst he was unlucky; then he married when he was only twenty-two, and\r\nafter that his luck changed, but as soon as he had made enough he cut\r\nthe mining and bought a share in a sheep-run. I don’t know if he would\r\nhave made anything more at the mining, but he was not very successful\r\nwith the sheep; still there was always enough to live on as far back\r\nas I can remember. I am the second of his three sons; my elder brother\r\ndied when he was a boy, my younger in 1882.”\r\n\r\n“And your mother and father?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, they died some while ago.”\r\n\r\n“You are the only one left?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, the only son of an only son. The family curse seems to have\r\nfallen upon us inoffensive colonists too; we are near dying out.”\r\n\r\nBill looked at him thoughtfully. “You are a long way from dead,” she\r\nremarked and then enquired as to the fate of the brothers of the elder\r\nGilchrist.\r\n\r\n“The younger,” Harborough answered, “died in 1845, so Mr. Wagnall told\r\nme, that is the year after my grandfather’s death; the elder came\r\ninto the property and has it still. He is the man at Wood Hall now,\r\na childless widower with no one nearer than a sister’s grandson to\r\nsucceed him. He was two years older than my grandfather, I think, born\r\nin 1820.”\r\n\r\n“In 1820,” Bill repeated thoughtfully; “then he was thirteen in 1833.\r\nOf course he remembered about the old Squire’s body; why he was the\r\nsame age as the granddaughter who planned it!”\r\n\r\n“Planned what? Whose granddaughter? What are you talking about?”\r\n\r\n“Only a tale that is told in Gurnett,” Bill made answer; “I will tell\r\nyou some other time; finish your family history first.”\r\n\r\nHe knew nothing as yet about her visit to Wood Hall. She would tell\r\nhim of course, as she saw no reason why he should object to it; but it\r\nwas a pity to interrupt his narrative, so she asked him to go on and\r\nexplain the way in which all this family history bore on his connection\r\nwith Wood Hall. Accordingly he told her of the custom of the succession\r\nof the youngest. “And it appears,” he concluded, “that, as the\r\nHarboroughs inherited according to this custom, the youngest son should\r\nalways have succeeded to the estates.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know why,” he answered, feeling the question to be entirely\r\nbeside the point. “It does not matter why; it was so, that is all. It\r\nis a tenure called Borough English by which some estates are held, and\r\napparently the Harboroughs’ originally was so held.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” Bill cried; “until the time of your grandfather Gilchrist it\r\nwas so, and then, owing to his going away before his son was born and\r\nthe other man not knowing he had a son at all, the elder brother got\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“Something of the sort.” Harborough was not inclined so entirely to\r\nattribute the chain of events to the ignorance of those in possession,\r\nbut that did not matter to Bill.\r\n\r\n“And you are going to claim through your grandfather?” she said.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I expect so, in time,” Gilchrist answered. “But you are in too\r\nmuch of a hurry; wait a bit, and I will explain. Most likely I shall\r\nnot claim in the present owner’s lifetime, that is if I ever do it at\r\nall; he is an old man in bad health, and they say he is not likely to\r\noutlast the year; I think I should wait till after his death.”\r\n\r\n“It would be kinder,” said Bill.\r\n\r\nBut that was not Harborough’s reason, and though he did not say so, he\r\nmade his real motive fairly clear. “It is a very difficult thing,” he\r\nsaid, “to turn out a man who has been in possession such a long time;\r\nindeed, it is just possible that if I could not prove that neither I\r\nnor my father knew that we had the right to claim for all those years,\r\nI should not be able to do it at all. If we had known it, and had for\r\nsome reason left Mr. Harborough in possession, I don’t believe we could\r\nturn him out; but as we did not know I ought to be able to do it,\r\nthough I don’t think I shall try unless he shows signs of living longer\r\nthan now seems likely.”\r\n\r\n“I see; then he will never know you have a claim?”\r\n\r\n“No, not if I can prevent it. I will tell you why. He does not care\r\nmuch for the heir, it is said, though he wishes him to have the\r\nproperty for family reasons; he is altogether rather an eccentric old\r\nman”--Bill knew that--“and it is possible that if he is left to himself\r\nhe will make no will. Now, I don’t want him to make a will, which\r\nwould only complicate the case. If he has no right to the property he\r\ncan’t bequeath it; but the existence of a will, bequeathing it to the\r\nrecognised heir, would give him a show of right which he would not\r\notherwise have. So, you see, I do not want a will made, and I do not\r\nwant to give Mr. Harborough any reason for making one by hinting at my\r\nclaim yet.”\r\n\r\n“Is that fair?” Bill asked.\r\n\r\n“Of course it is fair. What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know, I am not quite sure,” she answered thoughtfully; “I\r\nshall have to think about it. But don’t let’s bother now; tell me about\r\nyour case.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what you mean by fairness,” Harborough said somewhat\r\nseverely. “If there is anything unfair it is the way in which my people\r\nhave been kept out all these years. As to my case, there is very little\r\nmore to tell about it, except, of course, that I shall have to prove my\r\nlegitimate descent from Gilchrist Harborough, that my grandmother was\r\nlegally married to him, and all that.”\r\n\r\n“How could she be anything else?” Bill asked wondering.\r\n\r\n“He could have had another wife living at the same time, or he could\r\nhave been married before, or something of the sort.”\r\n\r\nThis was a new but impossible difficulty to Bill. “Oh, but he\r\nwouldn’t,--at least, seeing that he was a Harborough--” She paused and\r\nthen added demurely: “I thought you did not wish to belong to that\r\nplayed-out family, and had a poor opinion of their mortgaged property.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t help my ancestors,” Harborough replied, “and besides, they are\r\nsome way back; we have been honest working men for two generations. As\r\nfor the property, it is not so much encumbered as is usually thought,\r\nso Stevens, the lawyer at Wrugglesby, says; it is his opinion that a\r\npractical man with a small capital and reasonable notions could pull\r\nthe place together yet.”\r\n\r\n“You!” Bill cried. “‘Thou art the man’!” and she made the best\r\nobeisance to him that she could without getting down from her perch on\r\nthe low branch of an apple-tree.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know about the reasonable notions,” Harborough said seriously,\r\n“and as for the small capital, what I have is not large for such\r\na job; still, since I made the lucky speculation which emboldened\r\nme to ask you to be my wife, I suppose I can lay claim to a little\r\ncapital. Something could be done with the place I am sure; I drove\r\npast the other day and made observations; there is a lot of fine\r\ntimber still among all the rubbish in the wood and more in the open\r\npark-land--that’s worth something; then a good lot of that park could\r\nbe cultivated profitably; it would take time, but I believe it could be\r\ndone.”\r\n\r\n“And the house,” Bill added, “is big too. If we lived there we could\r\ntake boarders in the summer; if we advertised among the seaside and\r\nfarm-house lodgings in the time-table, we should be sure to get some\r\nanswers.”\r\n\r\nHarborough never was quite sure whether she was in fun or in earnest;\r\nhe was not sure now, but in either case he was annoyed and felt his\r\nannoyance to be justifiable. “That would be impossible,” he said\r\nseverely, though had he given expression to what was in his mind he\r\nwould have requested her not to be absurd. However, for politeness\r\nsake he contented himself with the milder speech, rising as he uttered\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“Why?” Bill asked jumping down from her perch.\r\n\r\n“Why? Because it would be out of the question. As Mrs. Harborough of\r\nWood Hall how could you receive boarders? It may be all very well for\r\nyou and Miss Hains to do it in London, though, as you know, I don’t\r\naltogether approve of the plan, but here--here it would be impossible.”\r\n\r\n“Why impossible? You don’t explain.”\r\n\r\nHe was holding the gate open for her, and jerked it with annoyance as\r\nhe answered. “To begin with, in that position--”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but there wouldn’t be one,” Bill interrupted; “there would be no\r\nposition. The stiff-necked county would hardly recognise you on the\r\nstrength of your grandfather if you ploughed your park; and as for\r\nme--even if I were Madame La Princesse your wife I should still be\r\n‘only Bill.’”\r\n\r\nShe uttered the name with the wealth of contempt and annoyance which\r\nPolly, at times of extreme irritation, could concentrate into its one\r\nsyllable. Harborough felt irritated too; no man who has all his life\r\nassumed an indifference to position likes to be shown that he too has a\r\ntrace of the universal respect for it.\r\n\r\n“If you think,” he said coldly, “that I care for the county you are\r\nvery much mistaken. Other people’s opinion is not of the slightest\r\nimportance to me as you should know, and though I care a good deal\r\nwhat manner of woman my wife is, it is for myself I care, not for my\r\nneighbours.”"

      "content": "THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF A GUARDIAN.\r\n\n“It is my belief,” said Miss Minchin to Miss Gruet, when the sultry\r\ndays of August had reduced the two ladies to visiting one another in\r\nthe cool of the evening only, “it’s my belief that Mr. Harborough is\r\ncourting Mrs. Morton’s cousin; he goes to Haylands so very regularly\r\nnow.”\r\n\r\n“Very likely,” Miss Gruet made answer, “although I should hardly have\r\nthought so poorly of him.”\r\n\r\n“So poorly?” Miss Minchin repeated.\r\n\r\n“Yes, so poorly, for she is little more than a child.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t know.” Miss Minchin bridled at some recollection. “I had\r\nan offer before I was her age.”\r\n\r\nThat was true, although, since the suitor was still younger it could\r\nhardly be regarded as eligible. Miss Gruet, having no such testimony\r\nto bring forward, contented herself with saying, “Girls don’t marry so\r\nyoung nowadays.”\r\n\r\n“No,” Miss Minchin was forced to admit, “no, perhaps you are right.\r\nBut what takes Mr. Harborough so often to Haylands? He must go to see\r\nsomeone; who is it?”\r\n\r\nNow, oddly enough, that was exactly the question Polly was propounding\r\nto herself, and seeing how entirely she considered the engagement\r\n(except for the secrecy) her own arrangement, it was strange.\r\nFortunately about this time she had ample opportunities for studying\r\nthe question, for she and Bella came to Ashelton as often as they could\r\nduring the summer months. They usually walked from Wrugglesby, nearly\r\na six miles’ tramp along dusty country roads; but as compensation they\r\nalways drove home with a certain quantity of spoil stowed under the\r\nseat. Sometimes it was butter they brought back packed in a damp cloth,\r\nor eggs carefully held in Bella’s lap, or chickens showing under the\r\nback seat; sometimes it was only vegetables, or a basket of fruit, or a\r\npigeon pie, or a basin of dripping, or some equally humble subscription\r\nto the larder. Polly despised nothing and refused nothing. When Theresa\r\nhardly liked to offer such trifles to the elder housekeeper, Bill\r\nrelieved her of any difficulties by putting various small articles in\r\nthe old safe which stood in the corner of the wash-house, and which\r\ncame in the course of time to be kept for Polly’s sole use. “That’ll do\r\nfor Polly,” she would say when Theresa debated how to use this or that;\r\nand if Theresa demurred saying, “I can’t offer her such things,” Bill\r\nassured her: “You can offer her anything you don’t mind her having; the\r\nonly thing you can’t offer her is anything you don’t want her to have\r\nand only offer out of politeness. Put it in her cupboard; she’ll take\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nAnd take it she always did. So, partly because this collecting of odds\r\nand ends suited her near, but effective, style of housekeeping, and\r\npartly from a sense of responsibility which prompted her to see how\r\nthings went on at Haylands, Polly came often to Ashelton that summer.\r\nAnd what she saw there led her to ask herself the question which Miss\r\nMinchin asked: “Whom did Gilchrist Harborough come to see?” And the\r\nanswer she gave herself was the one which with great truthfulness she\r\ngave in different words to Miss Minchin, “I don’t know.”\r\n\r\nMiss Minchin asked the question, or rather, by less bald methods\r\nsought the answer, when Polly came to stay at Haylands in August. It\r\nwas the middle of the month when she and Bella came; they had had to\r\ncontinue school during the earlier part of the month to compensate the\r\npupils for the time lost at Miss Brownlow’s death, but by the middle\r\nthey came to Ashelton to stay for a fortnight. For the first week\r\nTheresa would be there; for the second the three cousins would be left\r\nin charge as she and Robert were going away. It was a busy time for\r\na farmer to leave, but Robert did not seem to mind; as he said that\r\nhe would much rather leave now than in September, partridge-shooting\r\npossibly had more to do with his decision than farming. However that\r\nmight be, he decided to go, and Polly and Bella came to Haylands with\r\nthe understanding that they would look after Bill and the house during\r\nTheresa’s absence. It was a few days after their arrival that Polly met\r\nMiss Minchin in the lane. As they were going the same way they walked\r\non together, Miss Minchin making many enquiries as to the health and\r\ngeneral welfare of the cousins. Polly gave all suitable answers, and\r\ntalked in her best style, with perhaps more regard for effect than\r\naccuracy. What she said in reference to Harborough, however, was mainly\r\ntrue, more true than she herself liked under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nOf course, so she told herself, Harborough came to see Bill, and\r\nsince, being a busy man with no spare time, his visits were paid at\r\nfixed hours, he usually did see Bill. It sometimes happened, though\r\nnot often, that the time of his coming varied a little, and also it\r\nsometimes happened, even when he was regular, that Bill was busy or not\r\nto be found for a few minutes. On these occasions Theresa entertained\r\nhim until Bill appeared, when she would have been quite willing to\r\nleave them to enjoy each other’s society undisturbed. But they did not\r\nshow the least wish for such a thing. “We haven’t got anything private\r\nto say,” Bill told her once when Theresa remonstrated with her. So\r\nby degrees it came about that if the cousins were indoors Harborough\r\njoined them, and if they were out of doors he sat under the elm-tree\r\nwith them, helping Bill to shell peas or string currants, or whatever\r\npeaceful occupation she might be engaged upon that evening. Theresa\r\nwould willingly have taken such work from her on the evenings when\r\nHarborough came, but if she did Bill only got something else to do, and\r\nthat possibly of a less suitable nature. Theresa could not understand\r\nthe girl at all; she never seemed shy or eager to see her lover; she\r\nwas never anxious to put on her best frock for his coming; and yet she\r\nappeared happy in the engagement. Of course Harborough himself was not\r\ndemonstrative; he was always grave and serious when Theresa saw him,\r\nbut no doubt, so she thought, he was different in her absence, thinking\r\nwhich she went away. Whereupon, the currants being done, the pair took\r\nto watering the garden with a silent industry and a strict attention to\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nPolly saw all this and more still with her shrewd little eyes, and\r\nbefore Theresa went away she spoke to her on the subject.\r\n\r\n“You have noticed it too?” Theresa said, as if relieved to find it not\r\nall her own fancy. “Do you think Bill is really fond of him?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do, and I think it is very hard on her that you should take so\r\nmuch of his attention.”\r\n\r\n“I!” exclaimed Theresa flushing. “I! How can you say such a thing,\r\nPolly?”\r\n\r\nPolly both could and did say such a thing, and she said it with the\r\nrepetitions and variations she so well knew how to use, until Theresa,\r\nhurt and angry and mortified by turns, first denied the charge and then\r\ndefended the action.\r\n\r\n“Somebody must be civil to him,” she said at last. “Bill never wants to\r\nsee him alone; she makes him work in the garden if I leave them; she\r\nwon’t be nice to him or put her best dress on, or anything.”\r\n\r\n“Bill is a little goose, and the chances are she does all that out of\r\npride and contradiction because she is jealous of you.”\r\n\r\n“She can’t be jealous of me, it is impossible,” Theresa said, and the\r\nnext moment added, “and if she is, why does she not try to please\r\nhim? When he wants her to talk seriously she won’t; she says the most\r\nridiculous things in the gravest manner, and the gravest in the most\r\nridiculous, till he never knows how to take her, and that’s annoying to\r\na man, you know. And then she will persist in calling him Theo. For a\r\nlong time she did not call him anything, at least not when I was there,\r\nalways beginning, ‘I say,’ just as if that was his name; it was so\r\nrude, I told her about it. She said she did not like Gilchrist, there\r\nhad been too many of them. I told her to settle that with him, but I’m\r\nsure I don’t know what she said, for now she calls him Theo which she\r\nsays is short for theory, and I know he can’t bear it.”\r\n\r\nTo this recital of Bill’s misdeeds Polly only said: “I must have a good\r\ntalk with Bill, I think she minds me more than you; only, you know, my\r\ndear Theresa, your being nice to Gilchrist will hardly compensate for\r\nBill being nasty. I am sure you don’t mean anything but the very best,\r\nstill, quite unintentionally of course, you sometimes make it a little\r\nhard for her.”\r\n\r\nTheresa was truly grieved as Polly meant her to be, and determined to\r\nbe very careful of her conversation with Harborough in the future. It\r\nmust be admitted that she could not disguise from herself the fact that\r\nshe really did enjoy talking to him, and he could not disguise from her\r\nwoman’s wit the respectful and quite impersonal admiration he had for\r\nher.\r\n\r\nTheresa was easy enough to deal with; Bill was the real difficulty, as\r\nPolly knew, a difficulty she did not feel at all sure of being able to\r\ntackle successfully. She thought over the subject for some time, and\r\nfinally decided to leave it for the present. Theresa was going away\r\nin a day or two, and when she returned Bill herself was to leave with\r\nPolly and Bella. In these circumstances it hardly seemed necessary to\r\nopen the question now, and Polly determined to study the matter for the\r\npresent and speak of it while they were away together.\r\n\r\nTheresa was only away for a week, but the three cousins left behind\r\ncontrived to get a certain amount of excitement into the week. It was\r\nreally Bill’s fault, Polly said, Bill and her plums. Plums were very\r\nscarce that year, not only in Ashelton but in all that part of the\r\ncountry. There had been every promise of a good yield in the spring,\r\nbut a few late frosts had terribly damaged the crop; many trees were\r\nquite bare and many others had but little fruit; those in the Haylands\r\norchard had escaped. The plums were decidedly the best of the trees in\r\nthe orchard; they were younger and in better condition than the apples\r\nor pears, and they were, moreover, very good kinds. In the spring they\r\nhad shown every promise of abundance of fruit, and when the late frosts\r\ncame, damaging the neighbouring trees, they did not suffer much owing\r\nto good luck and a sheltered position. Bill was delighted by their\r\nescape, and during the summer took great interest in the health of the\r\ntrees, propping up the overloaded branches and regretfully thinning the\r\ntoo abundant crop. By the end of August the fruit was ripe and a source\r\nof great satisfaction to her.\r\n\r\n“I don’t see what you are going to do with them,” Polly said one\r\nmorning as she looked at the trees from which Bill was filling Bella’s\r\npudding-basin.\r\n\r\n“We can’t eat them all,” Bella said, biting one as she spoke, “nor make\r\njam, nor pies, nor give them away; there are far too many; they have\r\nall got ripe together. What a pity Theresa is not here; I wonder what\r\nshe does with the fruit.”\r\n\r\n“Sells it,” said Bill as she went on to look at the next tree.\r\n\r\n“To whom?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. The apples used to go away last year; I have seen some\r\nof the baskets about. These plums ought to be picked; they are quite\r\nripe and the wasps are getting at them.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Polly said judicially, “they ought to be picked to-day. I think,\r\nBill, you had better get what we want for jam and perhaps you might\r\nget a basketful for Mrs. Dawson. Mr. Dawson was saying the other day\r\nthat they had none at all. You had better gather all we can use this\r\nmorning.”\r\n\r\n“I mean to,” Bill replied, “but you have got to help. Oh, yes you have;\r\nthey must be all, or at least the greater part picked to-day; you will\r\nhave to help.”\r\n\r\n“Bill,” Polly began with dignity, but Bella, disturbed about her\r\nsister’s property, interposed. “It does seem a pity not to sell them: I\r\ndo think it is silly of Theresa not to have left any orders about them;\r\ncan’t we write to her?”\r\n\r\n“Not in time,” Bill answered. “I expect she left no orders because she\r\ndid not think; she and Robert always call these my trees, because I\r\ntake such an interest in them. Robert said I should keep anything I\r\ncould make out of them; I don’t want to do that, but I mean to make\r\nsomething.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see how you are going to sell them,” Polly called from the\r\ngate as she was leaving the orchard.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you? I have seen for several days. Don’t go, Polly, you must\r\nhelp to pick; it is going to be a busy day and you will have to help;\r\nyou might begin at once while I find the baskets.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll come too as soon as I have taken this to Jessie,” and Bella went\r\naway with the basin as she spoke, leaving Bill and Polly in animated\r\nconversation. When she came back to begin her share of the plum-picking\r\nshe found Polly at work; Bill had coerced her into it somehow, and,\r\nwhat was more remarkable still, kept her at it. They all three worked\r\nsteadily, finding it decidedly more tiring than they had anticipated.\r\nNot only did they gather the fruit, but they also packed it in the\r\nbaskets in which it was to travel. In time the baskets gave out, and\r\nBill proposed to borrow some from Mr. Dane. “I know he has got some,”\r\nshe said; “I saw them round by his back door the last time I went for\r\nbooks. It won’t take me long to go and borrow them.”\r\n\r\n“You can’t,” Polly said; “besides we have done enough; it is nearly\r\nfour o’clock.”\r\n\r\n“We sha’n’t have done enough,” Bill observed, descending her ladder,\r\n“until we have done all we can.”\r\n\r\n“It would be a great pity to waste any,” Bella added; “there are heaps\r\nmore just perfect, and this weather they won’t hang.”\r\n\r\n“Do you intend to keep on till dark?” Polly demanded. “How absurd! Have\r\nyou forgotten that Gilchrist Harborough is coming this evening?”\r\n\r\n“All the better,--he can help,” was the only answer, and the gate\r\nclosed after Bill as she went in quest of the rector’s baskets.\r\n\r\n“It is perfect nonsense,” Polly said wrathfully; “why couldn’t she have\r\ngot one of the men about the farm to do this work?”\r\n\r\n“They are busy,” Bella answered; “I expect she does not want to take\r\ntheir time, more especially as Robert said she could have the profits.”\r\n\r\n“There won’t be any; and if there are I see no reason why I should work\r\nfor her profit.”\r\n\r\n“It is not bad work. I wonder how she found out where to sell them; I\r\nexpect she made Theo tell her. Do you like him, Polly? I think I do.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t like this work,” was Polly’s only answer, “and I am not going\r\nto do any more of it at present; I shall lie down for half an hour.”\r\n\r\nAnd away she went, calculating that Bill could not be less than half\r\nan hour in borrowing the baskets, and in any case she would hear\r\nher return through the open window. Bella, left to herself, went on\r\nindustriously with her work until the sound of footsteps in the lane\r\narrested her attention. She was standing on a high rung of the ladder,\r\nand peering through the plum-branches, she looked to see who might be\r\npassing, secure that she herself was unseen. In this belief she was,\r\nhowever, mistaken, for the passer by glancing up at that moment had\r\nthe vision of a flushed face and a frame of golden hair, the curls all\r\nloosened and caught by the tiresome interwoven branches, the whole\r\nsurrounded by those same branches in a way which he found almost\r\nbewildering.\r\n\r\n“Good-afternoon, Miss Waring,” he said. “I was just on my way to\r\nHaylands about the bees,--is any one at home?”\r\n\r\nPolly was at home, but Polly might not like to be disturbed; still of\r\ncourse the bees were a matter of business, so Bella looked out again,\r\nor rather, partly looked out, having in the moment’s retirement given\r\nsome infinitesimal but effective touches to her tie and hair. Jack\r\nDawson found her irresistible, but he had found her that before. Mrs.\r\nDawson could hardly have selected a more momentous time for acquiring\r\na hive of bees than the one she did, for her son Jack discovered that\r\nthe Mortons’ bees were the best, in fact the only really good bees to\r\nbe had, and even these he found needed a great deal of investigation\r\nbefore purchase. At least such must have been the case to judge by the\r\nnumber of calls of inquiry he paid and the length of time he spent\r\nlooking at the hives with Bella. Mrs. Dawson is reported to have said\r\nat the end of the month that that hive cost her more than anything she\r\never bought, but eventually she came to a gentler way of thinking; for\r\nafter all, though it undoubtedly is a criminal offence for only sons to\r\nmarry, it is an offence they will commit, and Jack’s partner in guilt,\r\nor rather promised partner, won her way into Mrs. Dawson’s heart in\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nBut that was all in the future; in the present, Jack, on his mother’s\r\nbehalf, was industriously following up his quest for bees, and Bella,\r\non her sister’s behalf, was helping him. It is to be presumed that\r\nthese were their motives, though a casual observer might have thought\r\ntheir interests, though mutual, were more circumscribed on the occasion\r\nwhen they helped each other to gather Bill’s plums. Bella said she\r\ncould not leave off till Bill came back; it would be so unkind if both\r\nshe and Polly went away without a word of explanation. Jack agreed,\r\nsaying that there was no hurry and he could wait any time, and while he\r\nwaited he helped to make up for Polly’s desertion. Polly, meanwhile,\r\nslept peacefully, and Bill went by way of the rector’s back door into\r\nthe rector’s presence."

      "content": "THE PLUM HARVEST.\r\n\nBill was a privileged intruder at the rectory now, coming and going as\r\nshe chose, saying and doing what she chose, with no one to hinder her.\r\n\r\nAt first the old rector had not known whether he hated or loved this\r\ngrandchild of the dead past, this creature who was Wilhelmina, and\r\nGipsy Alardy, and a score of other things half bitter and half sweet.\r\nBut after a time he forgot to think of hatred or love; he never thought\r\nnow of that dead past, for she was not Wilhelmina, nor Gipsy Alardy,\r\nnor anything but her untutored, half-developed self. So he buried\r\nthe past again, and, accepting the present as he found it, turned to\r\nthe work in hand. In that work he included Bill, and the queerest,\r\npleasantest, most incomprehensible work he found her. So to the rectory\r\nshe came for all manner of things and to the rector for all manner\r\nof information; he seldom refused her, never repulsed her, listened\r\nto her plans and fancies, never condemned nor ridiculed, lending a\r\nsympathetic ear to all things, even including those which some would\r\nhave had him condemn. From her heart Bill longed to tell him of her\r\npromise to Harborough, feeling it almost a breach of confidence to\r\nshut him out of this secret; but when she asked Theresa if she might\r\nspeak, Theresa said she had better not. She knew Mr. Dane was kind to\r\nher young cousin, but she did not understand the odd friendship there\r\nwas between them, and, as she no doubt wisely said, should Bill tell\r\none person, Harborough could justly claim the right to tell one on\r\nhis side, and the secret would be a secret no longer; it must either\r\nremain among themselves or else be public to all the world. Bill saw\r\nno reason why it should be a secret, but as Polly advised her to say\r\njust what she thought best to Mr. Dane, she let the matter drop; she\r\ndid not know Polly’s motives, but she would not in this follow her\r\nadvice in opposition to Theresa’s. So Mr. Dane knew nothing about\r\nthe arrangement, knowing only, as all Ashelton knew, that Gilchrist\r\nHarborough went to Haylands, but, owing to what he himself knew of\r\nBill, he attached little importance to that.\r\n\r\nOn the day when Bill came to borrow the baskets the rector was busy, so\r\nbusy that he was not disturbed by her light footstep nor aware of her\r\npresence until she was by his chair making her request.\r\n\r\n“Baskets, Princess Puck?” he said; “of course, take what you like.”\r\n\r\nAnd she had gone again before the ink in his pen was dry.\r\n\r\n“Away already?” he said, looking up as the handle rattled when she\r\nclosed the door after her.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I’m very busy, and so are you.” She opened the door again an inch\r\nor two to say it.\r\n\r\n“Ah, I see; you’re always busy.”\r\n\r\n“I’m gathering plums. We have all three been doing it most of the day,\r\nand we shall keep on till dark; there are heaps to be gathered, the\r\nwhole lot are ripe together. Would you like some? I’ll send some this\r\nevening.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, thank you, you are very kind. I dare say I shall be down\r\nyour lane this evening, and if I am perhaps I can take them away with\r\nme; that will save your time and let me see you busy people at work.”\r\n\r\n“You will come?” Bill opened the door wider to put the question\r\njoyously. “Monseigneur, you shall have the biggest and best, and as\r\nmany as you can carry!”\r\n\r\nHarborough’s visit had passed entirely out of her mind, and when it\r\ncame back to her on her way home with the baskets she did not regret\r\nthe rector’s promise to come. She went to the orchard with a light\r\nheart, and an ungainly appearance, having slung the two biggest hampers\r\nacross her shoulders, to facilitate their transport, while she carried\r\nthe smaller baskets in her hands. She went by way of the fields, and\r\nas Miss Minchin was engaged in chasing the course of the sun with her\r\nwindow-blinds on the other side of the house, she reached the orchard\r\nunobserved.\r\n\r\nJack Dawson and Bella were on the same ladder, and in the heart of the\r\nsame plum-tree. They did not see Bill until she, having unburdened\r\nherself and discovered Polly’s absence, announced herself by the\r\nquestion, “Where is Polly?”\r\n\r\nA ripe plum fell heavily from the branch above as Bella started at the\r\nvoice. “I,--she’s gone in,--Mr. Dawson is helping me while she rests.”\r\n\r\n“How long has she been resting?”\r\n\r\n“Ever since you went away,--but, Bill--”\r\n\r\n“Don’t disturb her,” entreated a masculine voice from the branches, and\r\nthe masculine legs descended the ladder a little way. “I can stay and\r\ntake her place; she must be awfully tired, you know.”\r\n\r\n“She isn’t,” announced the inexorable Bill; “she’s lazy, that’s all. It\r\nis very good of you to offer to take her place, but if you really will\r\nhelp, you had much better take Bella’s; she has worked hard, as hard as\r\npossible.”\r\n\r\n“If Miss Waring will allow me to help her?” Jack suggested persuasively.\r\n\r\n“You will, won’t you, Bella?” Bill said; “and I’ll go and fetch Polly.”\r\nAnd she suited the action to the word.\r\n\r\n“It is a pity to disturb Miss Hains,” Jack said and Bella agreed with\r\nhim, sincerely hoping Bill would not succeed in the difficult task of\r\nuprooting the reposeful Polly.\r\n\r\nHowever she was disappointed; in a very short time Polly, gracious and\r\nserene, accompanied Bill to the orchard. But the indefatigable couple\r\nwere not disturbed in their industry, Polly, after polite greeting,\r\ngoing to work on a distant tree and taking Bill with her.\r\n\r\nJack Dawson helped them all the remainder of the afternoon, and\r\nHarborough found him still hard at work when he arrived in the\r\nevening. Polly, in her position of chaperone, regarded the two pairs\r\nwith a judicial eye and felt dissatisfied. Jack and Bella were well\r\nenough, and their relative output of work and conversation was more\r\ncalculated to satisfy her than the amateur market-gardener; it was the\r\nmarket-gardener herself and Gilchrist Harborough who displeased Polly.\r\n\r\n“That young man is a splendid agricultural implement,” was her opinion\r\nas she watched him. “He might as well be Darby’s digger or somebody’s\r\nsteam-plough, and Bill--well.” Here Polly sniffed aloud, but whether\r\nfrom contempt for Bill or sympathy with her own difficulties one could\r\nnot say. At that moment her attention was arrested by Bill’s voice.\r\n\r\n“You have come then, Monseigneur! You shall have the very best.”\r\n\r\nPolly looked round sharply; the tone of the girl’s voice was so unlike\r\nthat in which she usually spoke to Harborough, there was something of\r\ncaress in it, of the frank familiarity of assured welcome and response.\r\nIt was not wonderful that Polly looked to see if Theo answered to this\r\nnew nickname, and when it was evident he did not, that she looked still\r\nmore eagerly to see who did.\r\n\r\nMr. Dane, the courteous but somewhat exclusive rector of Ashelton! He\r\nwas Monseigneur, it was for him Bill was opening the rickety gate, he\r\nwhom she welcomed so gladly! It was surprising, Polly felt, but safe.\r\nPerhaps Harborough felt the same, for he did not seem to resent Bill’s\r\nevident satisfaction in Mr. Dane’s presence, and he did not, as Polly\r\ndid, lecture Bill afterwards on the impropriety of addressing elderly\r\ngentlemen in so free and easy a fashion.\r\n\r\nOf course Bill did not in the least mind what was said, and went to\r\nbed as indifferent to Polly’s remarks as Mr. Dane himself would have\r\nbeen. He went home thinking kindly of the young folks under the orchard\r\ntrees, pretty Bella and her suitors, as he took both young men to be,\r\nthe favoured and the unfavoured one. The favoured one,--and in judging\r\nJack Dawson to be such the rector was right--did not retire to rest in\r\nthe peaceful manner of the other plum-gatherers, having first had to\r\nendure an extremely stormy interview with his mother.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Bella had some idea of what might be taking place, for she lay\r\nawake long that night, though Bill, with whom she shared the room,\r\ndid not know it. The younger girl slept soundly and dreamlessly, not\r\ntroubling at all about Jack or Harborough, nor yet about her own plans\r\nfor the morrow. Those same plans necessitated getting up at a very\r\nearly hour the next morning; fortunately Bella was sleeping quietly at\r\nthe time, so without challenge Bill dressed and went out.\r\n\r\nIt was cold out of doors, everything drenched with dew; everything\r\nstill, almost awfully still,--the dead world, the motionless air, the\r\nopaque sky, dark except where at the horizon’s rim it showed faintly\r\ngrey like the ashes of yesterday. It was not really dark; Bill wondered\r\nwhy all things were so clear in this ghostly, shadowless twilight. “It\r\nis as if the world were dead,” she thought, “burned out and finished,\r\nresurrection and judgment over, and just me left behind forgotten.”\r\n\r\nThen she unlocked the stable-door and, putting fancies aside, set\r\nseriously to work, first harnessing the old roan horse to the roomy\r\nlight cart, and afterwards climbing in beside the hampers of plums\r\nplaced there over-night. She had told Polly and Bella that she herself\r\nwould take the plums away, and that she would have to start before\r\nbreakfast to do it. Bella was too much disturbed about her own concerns\r\nto feel much interest, and Polly saw no reason to object, as had\r\nTheresa been at home she possibly might have done. As it was, the two\r\nremaining cousins had breakfast without Bill, though Polly was much\r\nannoyed by a note the girl had left saying she would not be back till\r\nthe afternoon. All thoughts of Bill, however, were soon driven out of\r\nher head by the confidence Bella could withhold no longer.\r\n\r\nAnd thus it was that Bill drove away with her plums in the grey\r\ndawn, not to Wrugglesby and the railway-station, but to Darvel, the\r\nregimental town, a far longer distance but a bigger town with richer\r\ninhabitants, military and civil. The strawberry roan was a good old\r\nhorse though terribly ugly: he would trot well along the winding lanes\r\nand empty highways on the journey, and at the journey’s end stand\r\npatiently beside the curb while Bill went to the back doors to sell her\r\nplums. That was her notion of doing business; untroubled by any idea of\r\nlicense, and fortunately remaining untaught by painful experience, she\r\nwent from house to house selling her fruit by the pound, having taken\r\nthe dairy scales with her for the purpose. And a very good trade she\r\ndid, for plums were scarce and hers were beyond reproach; she asked a\r\nfair price and gave good weight, dealing as an honest and humble trader\r\nshould.\r\n\r\nIt was with a clear conscience and satisfied mind that she drove home,\r\nlight in load and heavy in pocket. She came back by the Wrugglesby\r\nroad, which was further but better going now that dry weather had\r\nloosened the roads. The afternoon was far advanced and the shadows\r\nstretched long on the cropped grass fields and matted seed-clover. In\r\nthe distance the air still quivered with heat, and the red-roofed farms\r\nglowed warmly in it. Now and again came the whirl of machinery, some\r\nstack in process of erection or a reaper in a wheat-field near at hand.\r\nBill looked around her, at the dusty hedgerows, the deep green trees,\r\nthe poppies by the road, it was all very good in the drowsy afternoon;\r\nthe whole world was so good, she could have sung aloud for joy.\r\n\r\nPropriety, however, demanded that she should not, and moreover some\r\none accosted her at that moment, a stranger asking the way to Sales\r\nCross. She pulled up to tell him and then, as she was passing that way\r\nherself, offered him a lift. He accepted, glancing at her curiously;\r\nthe voice and manner were not quite what he had expected from the\r\ngeneral appearance of herself and her equipage. However, he seated\r\nhimself beside her and began to speak of the harvest-prospects and\r\nthe weather, equally popular topics of conversation just then. A\r\nsmall farmer or bailiff’s daughter, he thought her, concluding that\r\nlatter-day education must in some way be responsible for her unusual\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nSo he talked to her on various topics, incidentally learning a little\r\nabout herself, among other things that she had been to Darvel to sell\r\nfruit. In this way, Bill making no effort to learn anything of him and\r\nhis business, they reached Sales Cross and there for the first time she\r\nasked him of his concerns, inquiring which way he wanted to go.\r\n\r\n“There is a footpath leading off from the road on the left, I am told,”\r\nhe said, and when she pointed it out to him he got down and bidding her\r\ngood-afternoon went on his way.\r\n\r\n“I wonder where he is going,” she thought. “He could get to part of\r\nAshelton that way, but I don’t suppose he is going there, and he could\r\nget to several other places equally well.” Then she drove on dismissing\r\nthe subject from her mind.\r\n\r\nNow, Polly, though she had talked and thought principally about Bella\r\nthat day, had found time, as the afternoon wore on, to wonder a little\r\nwhat mischief Bill had in hand, and to wonder a great deal more as to\r\nwho would find her out. Polly’s morals were of a strictly utilitarian\r\ncharacter, and being a great believer in the eleventh commandment\r\n_Thou shalt not be found out_, she was prepared to measure her wrath\r\nwith Bill’s misdoings in proportion to the publicity of their nature.\r\nTherefore when, at about five o’clock in the afternoon the offender\r\ncame to her on the lawn, she proceeded to catechise her in a brief and\r\nbusiness-like way, reserving her most important question till the last.\r\n\r\n“And whom did you meet? Who knows about this?”\r\n\r\n“Who? Why, of course, all the people I sold plums to, and--”\r\n\r\n“No, no, the people about here I mean, people whom we know.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no one.”\r\n\r\n“No one in Ashelton or Wrugglesby? Didn’t you see anyone to speak to?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I gave a lift to a stranger who wanted to find the way to Sales\r\nCross. He asked me if I had been to Wrugglesby market, and I told him\r\nthat it was not market-day, and that I had been to Darvel with fruit.”\r\n\r\nPolly was extremely angry at this indiscretion, and said so in no\r\nmeasured terms. She reflected, however, that, the man being a stranger,\r\nno harm had been done unless he happened to be visiting any of their\r\nacquaintances in the neighbourhood, in which case he might perhaps\r\nrecognise Bill on some future occasion.\r\n\r\n“But I don’t see what harm I have done,” Bill objected. “I dare say T.\r\nwon’t like it when I tell her, she is rather particular, but you are\r\nnot proud and it is no good saying you are; there is no reason why you\r\nshould object any more than Theo will when I tell him.”\r\n\r\nBut Polly was not at all sure that Theo would approve of Bill’s\r\nperformance, and she said so, without convincing Bill; she also\r\nreproved her sharply without showing her wherein lay the wrong. Bill,\r\nwho did not at all believe in Polly, was entirely unimpressed, and\r\nBella just then came out from the house.\r\n\r\n“Have you told her?” she asked, and Bill noticed that she looked\r\ntroubled and excited.\r\n\r\n“No,” Polly said, “I have not; I had enough to do thinking about her\r\nbehaviour.”\r\n\r\n“Told me what?” Bill asked. “What is it?”\r\n\r\nAnd because they felt the news they had to tell was of greater\r\nimportance than her own comparatively obscure misdoings, they told\r\nher. Soon even Polly had forgotten about Bill in the greater news; as\r\nfor Bill herself, she thought no more of anything but Bella and her\r\nhappiness in Jack’s love and her fear of Jack’s mother. Bill could\r\nnot quite understand the fear; if you were sure of the love, in her\r\nopinion, you could not be afraid, for nothing would matter. And the\r\nlove,--she looked rather wistfully at Bella, wondering why she could\r\nnot feel as this cousin did. But she said nothing of these things,\r\nforgetting them for the time being in the engrossing talk which was\r\nonly closed when they all went indoors, Bill saying as they went: “But,\r\nPolly, how about your lodgings now? By next summer you will have no one\r\nto help you.”\r\n\r\n“I shall go on alone,” Polly answered magnanimously. “I shall be able\r\nto do it, and even if I could not, I should not dream of standing in\r\nthe way of either of you.”\r\n\r\n“But you seem to want us both to get married,” Bill said.\r\n\r\n“I do, if you marry well. I am sure that neither of you would forget\r\nall I have done for you, and I am sure you will both remember how\r\nvaluable even trifles are to me.”\r\n\r\nThere was something faintly suggestive of the beggar’s whine in Polly’s\r\ntone, which made both the younger cousins laugh as they went into the\r\nhouse completely forgetful of Bill’s doings.\r\n\r\nBut there was one who did not forget them, who felt he had good reason\r\nto be angry with them, and that one was Gilchrist Harborough. It was\r\nto him that the stranger Bill met was going. He was a Sydney lawyer\r\nand the fortunate possessor of private means; he had been a friend of\r\nHarborough’s in the new country, and now that he was home for a holiday\r\nin the old, Harborough had thought it worth while to tell him the story\r\nof his claim to the Gurnett estates, asking his opinion rather than\r\nhis help. The lawyer, however, was so much impressed with the strength\r\nof the case when he first heard the story in June, that he immediately\r\nset to work on his own account to verify one or two necessary points.\r\nHaving by this week’s mail received from Australia the information he\r\nwanted, he came to tell Harborough of his success. At first he intended\r\nto write, but as he was going to stay a week or two with some friends\r\nfurther down the line, he broke his journey at Wrugglesby and spent a\r\ncouple of hours discussing the situation with Harborough.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, he did not confine himself entirely to business during\r\nthat couple of hours, for he casually mentioned the little fruit-seller\r\nwho gave him a lift in her empty cart. “The queerest little oddity\r\nI have ever seen,” he said. “I wonder if you know who she is; let’s\r\nsee if I can describe her. She was small, dark, shabby, shabbier\r\nthan any cottage-girl I have yet come across in this well-favoured\r\nold country--untidy, simple, though ’cute I should say, frank as an\r\nAmerican, brown as a berry, hair dark but reddish, face,--I don’t know,\r\na provoking little face, and perfectly irresistible eyes.”\r\n\r\nHarborough knew who she was though he did not say; a slighter\r\ndescription would have served him. There were not two such about; two\r\nbrown girls who spoke good English and sold fruit by the pound in\r\nDarvel, who wore their right boots laced with string (Harborough knew\r\nthat boot well) and had brown eyes with the sunshine in them; who made\r\nfriends with all comers, who whistled to the birds in the hedges, who\r\nwas, in fact,--Bill, his promised wife."

      "content": "PETER HARBOROUGH: SHOT.\r\n\nBella was not proud, neither was she exacting in any particular; but\r\nthere are times when even the least proud is tried by his family. Bella\r\nwas so tried on the day that she went with Polly and Bill to Bymouth.\r\n\r\nBymouth was the place selected by the three for the change which Polly\r\nsaid they needed after all their trouble. They could not afford a\r\nchange, it is true; but as Polly also said: “It is no good waiting till\r\nyou can afford a thing; by that time you will probably not want it.”\r\nBella agreed with Polly; Bill’s cautious vote on the opposite side was\r\noverruled, and to Bymouth they went. Bymouth, being four miles from a\r\nrailway-station, had the merit of being a cheap place; a railway-line\r\nwas indeed on its way there, but had not yet got very far. Visitors who\r\nwished to go to Bymouth drove from Bybridge, or walked, sending their\r\nluggage by the carrier’s cart. The cousins walked, and as the carrier\r\ncharged threepence for each package Polly said, “We must not take too\r\nmuch.”\r\n\r\nBella agreed: it was easy to agree, for they had not much to take, and\r\nthey were only going for a week; but Polly’s notion of luggage and\r\nBella’s were not identical. This was the first of Bella’s trials; the\r\nmatter of provisions was another question which needed settlement.\r\nPolly said they had better take all they could with them, for\r\nBymouth (she had never been there) was a very out-of-the-way place\r\nwhere everything would be difficult to get: also (she added as an\r\nafterthought) what they took with them they would have free, while\r\nwhat they bought there they would have to pay for. Bella did not see\r\nthe necessity of provisioning themselves as if they were going to a\r\ndesert-island; however, she gave way to a certain extent, and Polly put\r\na cold fowl in her hat-box (Bella would not have it in hers), three\r\nlarge lettuces rolled up in Bill’s bathing-dress, and a neat packet\r\nof fat ham in slices securely wedged among the same obliging cousin’s\r\nunderwear.\r\n\r\n“You can take the tea,” Polly said, handing Bella a large paper bag.\r\n\r\nBella took it in so pleasant a manner that Polly was induced to try her\r\nwith some plum turnovers which she was anxious not to leave behind,\r\nbecause she said, “they would be so nice to eat in the train.”\r\n\r\n“You can’t eat things in the train,” Bella exclaimed scandalised,\r\n“least of all plum turnovers. Besides, do you think I am going to open\r\nmy luggage in the train to get them out? Why, it will be in the van!”\r\n\r\n“So it will,” Polly agreed; “I forgot that. Still, they will be nice to\r\neat when we get there; we shall be hungry then, for we must dine very\r\nearly to leave in time.”\r\n\r\nBut Bella was obdurate; she would not take the turnovers, which she was\r\nsure would not be wanted.\r\n\r\n“Oh, well, please yourself,” Polly said good-humouredly, and packed\r\nthem in the crown of Bill’s hat. “She will have to wear her best one,”\r\nshe said; “this is much easier to pack.” And she crammed in hat and\r\nturnovers together.\r\n\r\nBella, not seeing what she was doing, raised no objections, but on\r\nthe subject of apples she was firm. There were a certain number of\r\nwindfall apples Polly wanted to bring, because, she said, fruit was\r\nalways dear at the seaside; but she could not get them in among her\r\nthings or Bill’s, and Bella absolutely declined to have them. Polly\r\nwas annoyed, but at last gave it up, leaving the apples scattered over\r\nthe dressing-table, while she turned her attention to strapping up\r\nwaterproofs. Bill had begun to do this, putting in with them an extra\r\npetticoat; Polly added the subscription of a dressing-jacket, but she\r\nwas called down-stairs just then and Bella took the straps from Bill\r\nand persuaded her to give up the idea of taking the additions. “You\r\ndon’t want them,” she said, “and we can’t go about looking as if we\r\nwere bringing home the family washing in a mackintosh.”\r\n\r\n“Why does Bella want to look so respectable?” Bill asked Polly, when\r\nthey were alone later on.\r\n\r\n“Because,” Polly answered severely, “she is a lady.”\r\n\r\nBill, not at all impressed, smiled her derision, and enquired: “Why\r\nwas she so cross when she found out too late that my best boots were\r\npacked?”\r\n\r\n“Because Jack Dawson will be at the station. Just as if”--Polly was\r\ncontemptuous--“he would look at your boots! It is market-day, so he\r\nis going to Wrugglesby; he is going to drive Bella--you and I and the\r\nluggage will go in the chaise with Sam.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” Bill said, and began to make various odds and ends, refused\r\naccommodation elsewhere, into a parcel. She had no idea of annoying\r\nBella, but she had two different pieces of brown paper, both too small,\r\nand no genius for making parcels.\r\n\r\nPolly glanced round to see if there was anything forgotten; her eye\r\nfell on the apples. “It does seem a pity to leave them,” she sighed.\r\nThen an idea occurred to her and her face brightened. “I know what I\r\nwill do,” she said.\r\n\r\nShe turned to an open drawer and stirred it over till she found a\r\nsmall calico bag. She had many such,--Bill called them nosebags--which\r\nshe used to hold all manner of odds and ends collected from various\r\npeople. The one she brought out now contained scraps of ribbon, the\r\naccumulation of many years. She emptied it, finding a home for most of\r\nits contents in a smaller bag already used to hold some fifteen pieces\r\nof pencil. Then she put the best of the apples into the empty bag and\r\nforced it some way up the centre of Bella’s neat roll of waterproofs.\r\n“It is a pity to unfasten them,” she said; “they are so nicely done up.\r\nI am sure the bag won’t fall out, and it hardly shows at all.”\r\n\r\nThat may have been, but the first thing Bella saw when she came on the\r\nplatform at Wrugglesby was the bag, mouth-end foremost, sticking out of\r\nthe roll which Bill held under her arm.\r\n\r\n“Are they here?” Jack asked as he came out of the booking-office with\r\nher ticket. They were here, very much here; poor Bella almost wished\r\nthey were not.\r\n\r\n“I don’t see them,” Jack went on, looking down the crowded platform:\r\nthe train stopped everywhere and was always full. “Oh yes,” he said at\r\nlast, “there’s Miss Hains, but I don’t see the luggage.”\r\n\r\nBella could hardly see anything else, she was so painfully conscious\r\nof it--Polly’s round tin hat-box, packed to bursting, with the white\r\nstring of some garment shut in the hinge; the little hair-trunk with a\r\nbroken handle (the property of the late Mr. Hains), Bill’s paper parcel\r\nresting on the top; Bill herself, with her old boots very much in\r\nevidence, standing beside.\r\n\r\nPolly caught sight of Bella and smiled pleasantly as they approached;\r\nJack took charge of the luggage and the train came in.\r\n\r\n“Jump in, and I’ll hand the things to you,” he said. “Are you going to\r\nhave this in the carriage?” and he lifted the tin hat-box which would\r\nneither go under a seat nor in a rack.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, please!” Polly cried, and took it from him.\r\n\r\nHe picked up Bill’s parcel; the two ends drooped in a dangerous\r\nmanner, but he handed it to its owner without mishap, while Polly\r\ntried to force the unwieldy hat-box under a seat. It would not go, and\r\nafter disturbing efforts Polly left it among the legs of the other\r\npassengers, straightening herself just in time to see Bill drop her\r\nparcel in Bella’s lap and take the roll which Jack handed to her, the\r\nbag of apples falling out with a thud as he did so.\r\n\r\n“Hullo!” said Jack; “what have I dropped?”\r\n\r\nBella grew scarlet, and prayed that the bag might have fallen down on\r\nthe line. No such thing,--it lay on the platform, one of the apples\r\nshaken out by the fall beside it. Jack picked it up and gave it to\r\nBill. “Here you are, Miss Bill,” he said; “wait a moment, here’s\r\nanother one,--you nearly lost your refreshment that time.”\r\n\r\nFortunately the train started almost immediately and so prevented Bill\r\nfrom explaining that the apples were Polly’s and not hers. Bella leaned\r\nback in the carriage overcome with shame, while Bill serenely restored\r\nthe apple to the bag, and then tried in vain to get it back into its\r\noriginal hiding-place. “It won’t go,” she said at last; “we shall\r\neither have to undo the straps or carry it separately: which would you\r\nrather, Bella?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t care; it does not matter.” Bella felt that to be asked which\r\nshe preferred now was adding insult to injury.\r\n\r\n“Let us undo the straps,” Polly said; “then we can put your parcel in\r\ntoo; it does not look very strong.”\r\n\r\nBill unfastened the straps, and finding the parcel too broad to\r\ngo inside comfortably, she unfastened that too and rearranged its\r\nmiscellaneous contents. Then she packed it and the apples into a\r\nwaterproof; one of the apples rolled on to the floor and was pounced\r\nupon by a small fellow-traveller.\r\n\r\n“Mustn’t, mustn’t,” the mother said; “it belongs to the ladies; give it\r\nto the ladies.”\r\n\r\nBut the ladies, as represented by Polly, were benign and made a present\r\nof the apple, afterwards entering into conversation with the mother on\r\nthe subject of the age and habits of the child. Bella took no part, and\r\nBill applied herself to the refastening of the straps. When that was\r\ndone she listened to what was being said, for the talk by this time had\r\nworked round to Bymouth, which, it seemed, the mother knew well.\r\n\r\nNow Bymouth had been Bill’s own choice; she did not know much about\r\nit, nor did the others, except that the journey there was a cheap\r\none and that, after all, was an important piece of knowledge. The\r\nthing, however, which attracted Bill was the fact that the recognised\r\nheir to Wood Hall had been spoken of in her presence as Harborough of\r\nBybridge. She did not exactly expect to come across him while passing\r\nthrough the small town on her way to Bymouth, but she had a vague idea\r\nthat she might see him, and she was anxious to know what he was like.\r\nYet another reason for her interest in the place was that her history\r\nof the county had told her that it was the home of the Corby family,\r\nthey who had also owned the small manor of Corbycroft whence the old\r\nSquire’s body had been carried to the Chapel at Wood Hall. Somewhere\r\nbetween Bybridge and Sandover, a place somewhat higher up the coast\r\nthan Bymouth, had been their ancestral home. It had been pulled down\r\nlong ago, and the family had died out, probably in great poverty from\r\nthe story of the old squire’s body being in danger of arrest for debt.\r\nBut in their day the Corbys had been rich: all the ground on which the\r\nnow fashionable watering-place of Sandover stood had been theirs; and\r\nthough as agricultural land it had not been worth much, its annual\r\nrental now was more than enough to reinstate the family fortunes twice\r\nover.\r\n\r\nBill asked many questions of their talkative travelling-companion when\r\nshe found that, besides being born at Bymouth, she had lived since\r\nher marriage at Sandover. However, she could tell little of what Bill\r\nwanted to know; she could speak of the extravagant price of lodgings\r\nat Sandover, the beauty of the pier, the number of the grocers’\r\nshops,--her husband owned one, the very best in the town. There were\r\ntombs, she said, lots of old tombs in St. Clement’s churchyard; people\r\noften came to see them. “Old gentlemen come with spades and things,”\r\nshe went on, becoming somewhat mixed in her ideas, “and poke about and\r\nread inscriptions and find no end--why, the cliffs are full of queer\r\nthings, fossils as big as your hand and little tiny shells. Sandover is\r\na very interesting place.”\r\n\r\n“I dare say,” Polly said with vacant affability; “we must try to go\r\nthere one day.”\r\n\r\nShe had not the least intention of going, but Bill, who did not say so,\r\nhad, and she brought their loquacious informant back to St. Clement’s\r\nand the tombs. After some time she learned that the interesting\r\nchurchyard was situated on the outskirts of Sandover, on the landward\r\nside. The particular attraction of the tombs she could not learn, her\r\ninformant having only been there once: “When my Joey was nine months\r\nold, and it was a hot day too, I carried him all the way; my sister,\r\nshe did offer to help me but--”\r\n\r\nHere she addressed herself to Polly, who sympathised on the subject of\r\nheat and the weight of nine months old babies until the tombs seemed\r\nforgotten. But Bill, patient and persistent, was at last rewarded by\r\nhearing that the charm of one lay in the fact that it commemorated a\r\nman who shot himself nearly a hundred years ago.\r\n\r\n“They say,” continued Joey’s mother, taking the core of the apple from\r\nthe disappointed Joey, to the great relief of a maiden lady in a light\r\ngown, “they do say he didn’t ought to’ve been buried there at all,\r\nfor they were very particular in those days about burying suicides at\r\nthe cross-roads. However, some thought he hadn’t really shot himself,\r\nbut that his friend, who he’d been gambling with, murdered him or\r\nsomething. They didn’t rightly know, so they put him in the churchyard\r\non the chance, as the nearest cross-roads had already been took up for\r\na farmer who cut his throat with a sickle.”\r\n\r\nBill, who had handled one, wondered how he did it, but contented\r\nherself with asking the name of the other suicide.\r\n\r\n“I can’t call to my mind,” was the answer she received, “but he was one\r\nof the gentlefolks. I’ve heard my good man say he was squire, but of\r\ncourse it was long before his time; there’s none of the name about now;\r\nbut my husband, he’s a great one for finding out things, he’s--”\r\n\r\nAnd there followed a detailed account of his peculiarities and\r\naccomplishments, at the conclusion of which Bill suggested that the\r\nforgotten name might be Corby.\r\n\r\n“That’s it!” the voluble lady exclaimed with delight. “Fancy you\r\nremembering it and me not! I have got a head! Corby, that’s it--or is\r\nit Harborough? There are both there, but I think it’s Corby; they were\r\nthe great people hereabouts; my man says they used to own all the land,\r\nbut they are dead and gone now, every one of them.”\r\n\r\n“Who owns the land now?” asked Bill.\r\n\r\n“A Mr. Briant, a rich man living in London; he comes to Bymouth for\r\nshooting, but he don’t trouble Sandover much. He’s made a good thing\r\nof it, a fine man of business he’s called, though I should call him\r\nprecious close myself.”\r\n\r\nA list of Mr. Briant’s delinquencies followed, with an account of the\r\nway in which he was bringing other seaside places into fashion, a form\r\nof speculation to which he seemed addicted. Bill did not listen very\r\nmuch, she was thinking of the long dead Corbys and Harboroughs. She\r\nthought of them a good deal both then and later, determining to pay\r\ntheir graves a visit at the first opportunity. But she did not put this\r\ndetermination into practice at once, for she forgot all about it during\r\nthe first two days at Bymouth. The cousins arrived there on a Thursday\r\nevening; Friday and Saturday were two golden, never-to-be-forgotten\r\ndays to Bill, in which she cannot be said to have thought of anyone\r\nor anything. She did precisely what she pleased, and, according to\r\nPolly, undid all the little good she had gained during the past months.\r\n“She is five years younger, and ten times worse than she ever was,”\r\nsaid that remorseless critic, and debated how best she could speak to\r\nthe offender about Gilchrist and her behaviour to him. Bill did not\r\ntrouble herself much about Gilchrist at this time; Polly told her that\r\nshe ought to write to him every day as Bella did to Jack, but this she\r\nentirely declined to do, and only under great pressure could she be\r\ninduced to write every other day, considering even that a great waste\r\nof time and stamps as she had nothing to say to him.\r\n\r\nWhile Polly was still pondering on the subject of Gilchrist Harborough,\r\nBill’s thoughts returned to the other and older members of the family.\r\nOn Sunday she recalled her intention of visiting their graves, and went\r\nto St. Clement’s, Sandover, for the afternoon service. She walked in\r\nthe heat of the day (thereby losing her dinner), reached the church\r\nin time for the _Magnificat_, and heard the dreariest music and the\r\nmost unedifying sermon in the world. But it did not matter; she was\r\nseventeen, sound in wind and limb, body and soul, and consequently\r\nquite unconscious of herself mentally, morally and physically. The\r\nwomanhood, which had timidly tried to assert itself during the early\r\nsummer, had slipped away; the thoughts and cares, the hopes and fancies\r\nwhich had begun to grow in the past months were lulled to sleep now by\r\nthe sea and the sunshine, playmates which had called her irresistibly\r\nduring these last days. She was a child still though she was not\r\nconscious of it; afterwards, in looking back, she knew those three\r\nperfect days were the last of her childhood.\r\n\r\nWhen the service was over she went out into the churchyard to examine\r\nthe gravestones, which did not prove so numerous or so interesting as\r\nshe had expected. A fair proportion of the older ones were in memory\r\nof the Corbys, who also, as she had seen during the service, had two\r\ntablets within the church inscribed to them. One she could not read;\r\nthe other was to the honour and glory of a lady named Jane, wife of\r\none Richard Corby, and evidently the pattern and model of what a wife\r\nshould be; she possessed so many virtues that Bill felt, when she saw\r\nhow young she had died, that, though sad, it was but natural.\r\n\r\n“She must have been the mother of the granddaughter who managed the old\r\nSquire’s burial,” she thought as she craned her neck to see the date.\r\n“I expect Jane would have objected to that business. I wonder what\r\nbecame of the granddaughter; perhaps she is buried outside.”\r\n\r\nBut she was not; there were no more recent tombs to the family outside.\r\nJane’s husband had died and been buried abroad some years after his\r\nwife, the event being announced briefly at the foot of the encomium of\r\nthat lady’s virtues. The old Squire, who must have died later still,\r\nwas not buried in this part of the country; the few graves in St.\r\nClement’s churchyard which bore the Corby name were all of older date,\r\nthe inscriptions of some half effaced, none in their briefness telling\r\na story, romantic or tragic, of that forgotten past. The stone slab in\r\nmemory of the suicide was hardly an exception to this rule, and the man\r\nwhose brief record it bore was not a Corby at all. _Peter Harborough,\r\ndied at Corby Dean in this parish. March 12th, 1799. Shot._ That was\r\nall; of the history of his life and the tragedy of his death there had\r\nbeen found nothing to say but the one word, _shot_. To Bill it seemed\r\nalmost terrible in its uncompromising briefness. As she stood looking\r\nat the stone, a brown-winged butterfly rested for a moment on the\r\nmoss-grown lettering. “Who did it?” She asked herself. “Who and why?”\r\nBut there was no answer; she did not know who, nor yet why some unknown\r\nhand had left this single record of the tragedy.\r\n\r\nShe turned away at last, and unfolding the cheap little map of the\r\ndistrict she had borrowed to help her on the way to St. Clement’s,\r\nshe spread it on a flat tombstone and searched for Corby Dean. It\r\nused to be the seat of the Corby family, she knew; now that the house\r\nwas pulled down the name seemed to have passed to a small farm and a\r\nhandful of cottages built, apparently, on the spot where the house once\r\nstood.\r\n\r\n“Corby Dean meant the house where Peter Harborough was shot,” Bill\r\nsaid with her finger on the map. “He was with the Corbys then. What\r\nhappened? What were they doing?”\r\n\r\nShe clasped her hands round her knee and gave herself up to dreams.\r\nAll round her was the peace of earliest September, rich in its haze of\r\ntender warmth, summer still except for the opalescence of its lights,\r\nthe coolness of its lengthening shadows. But Bill did not see it; she\r\nwas building in her mind a history of the past, reconstructing the\r\nlife which had been, groping in her memory, feeling that there, if she\r\ncould but find it, was a picture of this old tragedy; a tale, nay, more\r\nthan a tale, an actual experience if she could but recall it. A robin\r\nchirped shrilly in the churchyard yew; she started at the sound and the\r\nhalf-awakened memory was gone from her, the ghosts crept back to their\r\ngraves, the past was merged in shadows again. Here was nothing but the\r\nstillness of Sunday afternoon, the peace of the earth’s sabbaths of\r\nSeptember. Such golden restful days had been before these men lived,\r\nand still were though they were gone.\r\n\r\nShe rose, and folding her map, went out of the churchyard shutting the\r\ngate behind her. Dead; that generation was dead, gone, forgotten, that\r\ngeneration--and the next? That too was lost in mist--and the next? The\r\nCorbys were ended, exhausted, but the Harboroughs? This brought her to\r\nthe present day and to Harborough of Bybridge. She remembered that as\r\nyet she had heard nothing of him, and so remembering, she determined\r\nif possible to find out what manner of man he was--a determination she\r\nneed hardly have troubled to make, for the next day, without effort on\r\nher own part, she knew.\r\n\r\nMonday did not seem a propitious day for discoveries; the weather was\r\nunsettled in the morning and the afternoon was one of ceaseless rain.\r\nPolly, seeing the state of affairs, prepared to spend three pleasant\r\nhours over her wardrobe; she pulled the table to the window, brought\r\nout her Sunday hat, took off the trimming, and proceeded to rearrange\r\nit with the bows behind instead of before. Bella retired to the bedroom\r\n(they only had one between the three) to write a letter, and Bill found\r\na delightful occupation down-stairs. Their rooms were over the village\r\nshop which was also the post-office for a wide district. The rain\r\nseemed to make very little difference to the business done there; in\r\nfact it appeared to rather increase the number of customers, those who\r\nwere not obliged to come finding some excuse to spend ten minutes or so\r\nin this cheerful little centre of gossip.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rose, the landlady and post-mistress, was short-handed just\r\nat present, her assistant having gone home to nurse a sick mother.\r\nThe girl who helped with the housework came in to lend a hand, but\r\nshe was not clever, and the drawing-room lodgers had an elaborate\r\ntea at five o’clock which seemed to require much preparation in the\r\nafternoon. Thus it was without much trouble that Bill persuaded Mrs.\r\nRose to let her help in the shop that day. The permission once given\r\nshe set to work with great satisfaction, and soon found out something\r\nof the whereabouts of the articles most in demand. The stock was a\r\nvery miscellaneous one, ranging from boots and twine through strange\r\nspecimens of crockery and many-coloured cottons to Gregory’s Powder\r\nand treacle. Occasionally it took some little while to find the\r\nthing required, but the customers were in no hurry; indeed, most of\r\nthem seemed more inclined to talk than to buy, Mrs. Rose seconding\r\nthem when she was not despatching a telegram or otherwise conducting\r\nState-affairs through the medium of her post-office. Bill talked a good\r\ndeal and listened even more; her parcels, it is to be feared, were not\r\nof the neatest, but her conversation was admirable and the customers\r\nseemed satisfied.\r\n\r\nThese customers were a representative lot. Some were visitors who\r\nfound the afternoon tedious and came to while away the time by buying\r\nsweetmeats or papers or strange little penny dolls, according to their\r\nage and tastes; some were neighbours from near by come for a pound of\r\nmarmalade and a gossip; others were from the next village, genuine\r\ncustomers really anxious to transact business. The landlady from the\r\nhouse next door came once, being in trouble because her lodgers would\r\nhave curry that night, and “she without a mite of curry-powder in the\r\nhouse.” A man from the coastguard station came asking for a species of\r\ntobacco that Bill took ten minutes to find, during which time he gave\r\nlimitless information about the prospects of the weather. One of the\r\ncustomers was an anxious mother who wanted to buy castor-oil, but Bill,\r\ndiscovering that there was none, induced her to have Gregory’s Powder\r\ninstead. “It will do just as well if he is five years old,” she said\r\nputting up a small dose. “Now, my dear, what for you?” This was said to\r\na little girl with eyes just level with the top of the high counter.\r\n\r\n“Treacle, half cup,” was the answer, and the cup, with the coppers\r\nwrapped in paper reposing inside it, was handed up.\r\n\r\nBill turned to the green barrel-shaped tin canister with the label\r\n_golden syrup_ and the spigot-tap she had been itching to turn all the\r\nafternoon. As the purchaser of Gregory’s Powder left the shop, another\r\ncustomer came in, a young fellow in splashed gaiters and streaming\r\nmackintosh. Bill did not notice him much, being engaged in a struggle\r\nwith the tap grown stiff by reason of age and treacle. He held a paper\r\nin his hand, perhaps a telegram, but he waited patiently enough while\r\nan animated conversation went on between Mrs. Rose and an elderly lady\r\nwhom she had just served. The tap moved a little, and the treacle began\r\nto run, slowly, it must be admitted, but still it ran, in the course of\r\ntime doubtless the cup would be half filled. Bill glanced at the last\r\ncomer; “a member of the surrounding aristocracy” she thought, noticing\r\nan indefinable something about his clothes and bearing and clear-cut\r\nprofile. When he turned the accuracy of the profile was lost, but the\r\neyes, very grave young eyes, met hers and--\r\n\r\nHer heart began to beat very fast, though she could not in the least\r\ntell why. She ought to have lowered her eyes, but she did not; they\r\nwere fixed; she could not look away, and he did not look away either.\r\nShe could hear the beating of her heart plainly, almost as if some\r\ngiant hand were clutching it. She was afraid, she knew not of what,\r\nafraid to look, afraid to look away, most terribly afraid of herself,\r\nashamed, yet foolishly, triumphantly glad. Her hands grew very cold and\r\nmoist, her breath came short, she lost consciousness of what was going\r\non around her; the little dim shop vanished, the pile of boots and pans\r\nand seaside pails, the child who peered at her over the counter, the\r\nwomen who talked by the desk. They two were alone, he and she, alone in\r\nall the world.\r\n\r\n“Cup’s runnin’ ower.”\r\n\r\nBill started like one waking from a deep sleep; the dark, greenish\r\nfluid was slowly running over the sides of the cup. She forced the\r\ntap back; her hands seemed so weak it was difficult to move it, and\r\nthey trembled till she could hardly hold the cup. She gave it to the\r\nchild,--one cannot put surplus treacle back into a tightly closed\r\ncanister--she gave it, full as it was, and the child took it, carefully\r\nlicking the edges to prevent any running to waste, and walked sedately\r\nout of the shop. Bill sat down on a little high stool behind the\r\ncounter; her face was very pale and she was shaking all over. Mrs.\r\nRose, who had disposed of her last customer, saw her. “Why Missie,” she\r\nsaid, “you’re tired out. I oughtn’t of kep’ you here all this blessed\r\nafternoon.”\r\n\r\n“I am not tired, thank you,” Bill protested mechanically.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Rose was unconvinced. “That I’m sure you are; I never saw\r\nsuch a lot of folks as we had this afternoon, a gossipin’ lot too. As\r\nfor that Mrs. Randal, I thought she’d never go, taking up the room\r\nlike that! I’m sure that gentleman was going to send a telegram and he\r\nnever did; he walked out of the shop without sayin’ a word, a loss of\r\nsixpence to the Government.”\r\n\r\n“Who is he, do you know?” Bill’s voice sounded curiously stifled in her\r\nown ears; she looked down as she spoke, but she could feel the colour\r\nrising to her forehead.\r\n\r\n“Who? Why, young Mr. Harborough of Bybridge.”"

      "content": "HARBOROUGH OF BYBRIDGE.\r\n\nKit Harborough paced the lane restlessly. The rain had ceased but he\r\nstill wore his long mackintosh, and in one pocket the unsent telegram\r\nwas crushed forgotten. For a moment he stood, then walked his five\r\nyard beat of wet road again. A church-bell sounded on the moist\r\nair,--curfew, they still tolled curfew at Bymouth; it was eight o’clock\r\nand nearly dark in the deep lane. On either hand rose high banks\r\nluxuriant with unclipped nuts and dogwood and sharp-thorned sloes,\r\nthe late rain still dripping from every spray; the pleasant scent of\r\nwet ferns filled the air, the pungent flavour of the fungus on some\r\ntree-stump in the hedge mingling with the smell of the drenched grass\r\ngrowing tall and rank beside the road. The fragrance of the refreshed\r\nearth reached Kit but he hardly knew it, hardly heard the creak of the\r\nhidden grasshoppers in the moist darkness of the banks, hardly saw the\r\nwild flowers glimmering in the roadside grass.\r\n\r\nHe leaned against a gate and looked across the darkening land,\r\nacross the stubble-field whence the corn had been carried, over the\r\nslope of the hill to the village in the hollow, a huddle of roofs\r\nin the gathering gloom, the chimneys sharp against the sky and the\r\nsmoke-wreaths hanging low in the wet air. Lights were beginning to\r\ntwinkle here and there, one in the house at the corner, the little shop\r\nwhere he had seen her.\r\n\r\nHe settled himself against the gate-post and watched. He was\r\ntwo-and-twenty and had never looked consciously at a woman before.\r\nTwo and twenty, and now he had found, among the mouse-traps and\r\nstring-balls and miscellaneous gear of a village shop, a little brown\r\nwitch with the spell of a dead man’s charm in her eyes, the passion of\r\na dead woman’s love in her blood!\r\n\r\nA partridge rose suddenly on the further side of the stubble-field;\r\nthere was a whirr of wings, and then silence again and the soft drip of\r\nthe wet trees. Then he heard a swift, light footfall, and saw a little\r\nfigure speeding up the lane, perhaps to reach the high ground near the\r\ngate whence to look at the surrounding country in the beauty of this\r\ntearful twilight.\r\n\r\nKit Harborough stepped out of the shadow by the gate to the centre of\r\nthe road: the girl stopped abruptly with a little cry.\r\n\r\n“I knew you would come,” he said.\r\n\r\nHe did not know how he knew, or if he really knew; he did not stop to\r\nconsider and she did not ask him. “You!” was all she said, “You!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he answered.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” and it seemed almost as if she were distressed. “I--I wanted to\r\nspeak to you; I have something I must tell you.”\r\n\r\n“Me? I am very glad.”\r\n\r\nHe was astonished at himself, being a curiously diffident boy in\r\nsome respects; so inexperienced, too, that had he stopped to think he\r\nwould never have known what to say. But he did not think, he spoke on\r\nimpulse, and the words came naturally enough; his only fear was lest\r\nshe should escape and he should lose her in the gloom, but even that\r\nwas not a real fear; he felt as if he could prevent her.\r\n\r\nShe was standing in the middle of the road now. “You are glad?” she\r\nsaid. “That is because you do not know.”\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him as she spoke and he, because he could not help it,\r\nor because he willed it, or for some other reason, or the want of one,\r\nlooked down at her.\r\n\r\nAh the smell of the rain-washed earth and the wood-smoke from the\r\ncottage below the hill, the chirp of hidden grasshoppers, the drip,\r\ndrip, drip from the nut-boughs near the gate! Ah youth and ignorance\r\nand the first sweet taste of love and life!\r\n\r\nThe partridge, disturbed by the girl’s coming, returned to rest\r\nchuckling softly. Kit looked round but did not move; he was not very\r\nclose to her; it seemed almost as if he thought the place whereon she\r\nstood was holy ground.\r\n\r\n“Bill!”--Polly’s voice rang shrilly--“Bill! Are you up the lane? Come\r\nin at once!” For an instant even the grasshoppers ceased, then--“Bill!\r\nBill!” came again, but no nearer, Polly did not wish to brave the mud\r\nof the lane needlessly.\r\n\r\n“I must go,” Bill said; “and oh,”--with sudden remorse for the lost\r\nmoments--“I have not told you!”\r\n\r\n“Tell me to-morrow.” He was surprised at his own boldness. “I am\r\nstaying here, at the River House, and you--”\r\n\r\n“We are staying at the shop--you know.” Bill grew rosy in the darkness.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know,” he answered very softly.\r\n\r\n“We go away on Thursday, and I must tell you.”\r\n\r\n“Thursday!”\r\n\r\n“Bill!” Polly could not make up her mind whether Bill was in the lane\r\nor not.\r\n\r\nBut the culprit, who was thinking solely of the news she had to tell\r\nKit Harborough, did not heed Polly. “I must tell you,” she said, “you\r\nmust hear, it is so unfair! But when? How?--oh, it is hard!”\r\n\r\n“Hard?”\r\n\r\n“Bi-ill!”\r\n\r\n“I must go!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but first, when shall I see you? When will you tell me?”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow early.” Bill instinctively fixed her clandestine affairs\r\nfor the time when the less energetic cousins were not awake to their\r\nresponsibilities or her proceedings. “Early,--I’ll bathe before\r\nbreakfast.”\r\n\r\n“So will I; I often go for a swim first thing, and afterwards--”\r\n\r\n“I will meet you,”--she finished for him--“about seven; I will tell you\r\nthen.”\r\n\r\n“Bill! I can hear you talking! You are in the lane!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Polly, and I am going back across the field so I shall be home\r\nbefore you.” And she was over the gate and down the field almost before\r\nKit realised she was gone.\r\n\r\nPolly turned round and went home; she had never ventured further than\r\nthe mouth of the lane, neither was she certain that she heard Bill’s\r\nvoice in conversation, but she was exceedingly annoyed with Bill\r\nfor having kept her standing there so long in the damp. She was also\r\nslightly annoyed with herself for being kept. “As if it mattered what\r\nBill did!” Only, as she was out (Bella had a romantic idea that she\r\nwanted to look at the sea by night) she thought she might as well see\r\nwhat Bill was doing. She had an instinctive feeling, based on her\r\ngeneral distrust of humanity, that Bill was sure to be doing something\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of her own satisfaction--Polly not possessing the\r\ndisposition which “rejoiceth not in iniquity”--it is a pity she did\r\nnot penetrate a little way up the lane, for she certainly would have\r\nseen Kit Harborough had she done so. He stood where he was for a full\r\nminute after Bill had left him, absolutely still in the middle of the\r\nroad. It did not matter; he was already so hopelessly late for dinner\r\nat the River House that a minute either way could make no difference.\r\nIf he changed very quickly there was a chance that he would be in time\r\nfor the cheese; earlier than that he could not expect to appear. Dinner\r\nand such mundane matters did not occur to him till after Bill had gone,\r\nand when they did he wondered what excuse he was to give to his host.\r\nOn this subject he need not have troubled himself, for his elaborate\r\nexplanations were thrown away, Mr. Briant not being deceived by them\r\nfor a moment.\r\n\r\n“Petticoat,” he observed briefly in answer to all Kit had to say. He\r\nwas a man of some experience, and there was something in the boy’s\r\nmanner, in his very indifference to dinner, which betrayed him to his\r\nelders.\r\n\r\nHe flushed hotly; it was desecration even to think of Bill and the\r\nmeeting in the lane here.\r\n\r\n“Hullo! It seems a serious case,” some one observed, and a man at Kit’s\r\nelbow inquired: “First, isn’t it, Harborough? Lucky young dog, he’s\r\nnever met a divinity before; he has got it all to come.”\r\n\r\nKit’s eyes flashed. “You are entirely mistaken,” he said coldly.\r\n\r\n“All right,” his host said with great good-humour. “Did you send my\r\ntelegram?”\r\n\r\nUntil that moment he had not thought of it; “I--I forgot it,” he was\r\nobliged to answer confusedly.\r\n\r\n“What a deuce of a time she kept you!”\r\n\r\n“She did not! She did no such thing.”\r\n\r\nThere was a roar of laughter, and Kit, realising his blunder, had the\r\ngood sense to leave it and apologise for the neglect of the telegram.\r\nThis being of but slight importance was forgotten by the party far more\r\nquickly than his unfortunate admission.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Bill was also taking the consequences of her wanderings\r\nin the lane. Polly was severely reprimanding her for going out after\r\ndark, for keeping other people waiting about in the damp, and for\r\ngossiping with farm-labourers and other persons. To all of which Bill\r\nlistened with the tolerant indifference with which she often treated\r\nPolly’s harangues. “Let’s have supper,” she said at last. “I have told\r\nyou I went out because I felt as if--as if I should burst if I stopped\r\nin any longer. I had to go out, to get away; it was a pure accident\r\nthat I met any one.”\r\n\r\nPolly said, “Oh, I dare say,” and repeated several of her previous\r\nremarks with variations. Then they had supper, Polly still a little\r\ndifficult in temper; the drawing-room lodgers had had steak and onions\r\nfor tea, and she being one who dearly loved what she called “a relish\r\nwith her tea,” had not yet got over the appetising odour which had not\r\nserved as a relish to her own bread and jam.\r\n\r\nNever before in her life had Bill so longed to be alone--to be\r\nabsolutely by herself, if it were only for half an hour. But it was\r\nout of the question; even when they went to bed the only solitude\r\npossible was the compromise of companionship offered when the cousins\r\nwere asleep. She thought once of stealing softly down to the darkened\r\nsitting-room to spend an hour there in the starlight, but the bedroom\r\ndoor rattled so terribly that she was certain in opening it to awaken\r\nBella if not Polly. She was afraid of facing their curious inquiries,\r\nshe who so seldom had been afraid before, who never knew when her\r\nconduct was strange or worthy to invite inquiry until the fact was\r\nplainly shown her; there was some subtle change in her.\r\n\r\nShe lay still on the outer edge of the wide low bed she shared with\r\nPolly, and tried to think. The room was very dark and quiet, yet she\r\ncould not think. There was neither Kit nor Gilchrist in her mind,\r\nneither past, present, nor future; it was all a whirl, with for\r\nparamount feeling the thought of that unmade claim to the Harborough\r\nestates.\r\n\r\n“It is not fair,” she thought. “He shall know; they shall fight fairly;\r\nI will tell, whether it makes a difference or not.” Then the picture\r\nof Wood Hall came into her mind, the stately house in the autumn of\r\nits days, the great hall, the solemn rooms, “Theo’s, all Theo’s! Theo\r\nthere, Theo and the boarders!” She laughed softly, half hysterically,\r\nat the idea. “He thought I meant it,” she said.\r\n\r\nPolly muttered indistinctly in her sleep. Wood Hall and the gardens,\r\nthe tangled rose-walk and the lawns, how green the grass would be\r\nnow! The wood on the slope of the hill--there would be yellow leaves\r\nhere and there, and the bracken would be golden--how very beautiful\r\nit all would be! September suited the place, but October would suit\r\nit even better, the long west front in the afternoon glow, the great\r\narched doorway, all of it. And so on and on, a hundred vague ideas, a\r\ntangle of emotions, but never Kit; she never once faced the thought of\r\nhim. At last she slept and dreamed--our dreams are our own; we are not\r\naccountable for them. In the morning things looked clearer and emotions\r\nfainter. Sleep blots out some of the fancies and brings facts into a\r\nbetter working perspective. When in the morning Bill rose early to keep\r\nher appointment she had a distinct notion of what she was going to do.\r\nShe got up and dressed quietly: for the first time in her life she was\r\ntroubled because her gown was shabby; but she did not know why, for she\r\nhad not consciously considered the question of Kit Harborough at all.\r\nShe was going to meet him, it is true, but that was solely to warn him\r\nof the danger which threatened him. Still she was sorry her frock was\r\nshabby, and her old straw hat a little the worse for the plum turnovers\r\nand a good deal the worse for wear.\r\n\r\nBut she did not trouble herself much. By the time she had finished\r\nher bath she had forgotten about appearances; also to a certain\r\nextent she had forgotten her troubles, washed them away in the kindly\r\nsea or evaporated them in the sunny air: there was not, up to the\r\npresent, anything so very much amiss in her world that still September\r\nmorning. She was whistling softly when Kit found her, wringing her wet\r\nbathing-dress the while.\r\n\r\n“Let me do that for you,” he said.\r\n\r\nShe held the dress a moment. “You had better not,” she said, “it will\r\nmake your hands blue; the dye comes out like anything. The first time\r\nit got wet I was like an ancient Briton; it is not so bad now, but it\r\nstill makes one a bit stripy.”\r\n\r\nKit protested that he did not mind the dye and took the dress while\r\nshe gathered up her towels and hung them in festoons about the tent,\r\nwhistling when she was on the far side.\r\n\r\n“Is that you?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she admitted, wondering if he thought it unladylike.\r\n\r\nHe did not; he seemed to think it clever. “What a mimic you are!” he\r\nsaid. “It was just like a chaffinch.”\r\n\r\n“I can imitate some things,--birds.” Bill forgot her mockery of her\r\nfellow-men; she forgot all those things, for there was a curious holy\r\nfeeling about her just then.\r\n\r\nKit had finished wringing the dress and was carrying it now as they\r\nwalked slowly along the shore. “Not all birds?” he was saying; “not a\r\nlark!”\r\n\r\n“No, not a lark, I have never tried to do that; I don’t think I could.\r\nI don’t think there is anything quite like a lark’s song; it is so\r\ncompletely, absolutely happy; I don’t believe anyone could imitate\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\nHe agreed with her and then asked if she knew Shelley’s Ode to the\r\nSkylark. They were not approaching the business of their interview very\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\nBill shook her head. “I don’t know any of his poetry,” she said,\r\n“except a piece about the moon which we had to analyse in our\r\ngrammar-class last Christmas. It was beautiful poetry, though I never\r\ncould find the principal sentence.”\r\n\r\n“What a shame to give you Shelley for that!”\r\n\r\nBill thought it was too, and then Kit told her he believed she would\r\nlike the Ode to the Skylark.\r\n\r\n“Tell me some,” she said.\r\n\r\nHe obeyed and repeated the greater part. Business was receding even\r\nfurther into the distance.\r\n\r\nHis was somewhat of a studious nature, and he had, moreover, the\r\nmusician’s ear for harmonious sound and the unspoiled heart to delight\r\nin beautiful thought. She was a greedy listener, her mind an empty well\r\nin its ignorance, in its insatiable desire to be filled; she, too, had\r\nthe love of melody, though never till that moment had she felt the\r\nneed of the universe and of her own soul to be expressed in rhythm.\r\nBut now the whole world somehow became one pulsing harmony, and they\r\ntwo wandered along the lonely shore in that dream which comes twice to\r\nno man. The air around them was delicate and crisp, fresh yet tenderly\r\nsoft, the sunlight chastened and mild, threading with sloping bars the\r\nmist on the land, gleaming bright and pale on the wet sand and the\r\nincoming tide and the great white gulls that played in the creeping\r\nwaves.\r\n\r\nBusiness and the purpose of their meeting receded further and further;\r\nindeed, it might almost have been forgotten entirely had it not been\r\nreached by a most circuitous route through Byron and Heine. They had\r\nbeen speaking of the sea’s place in poetry and concluded with the\r\nopinion that none of the poets had quite expressed their sentiments on\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\n“They don’t seem to get at the sort of mother-feeling,” Bill said at\r\nlast; “at least none of those we know do. I mean the kind of feeling\r\nof going home that you get when you come near the sea--you know what\r\nI mean? It seems sometimes as if it stretched out its arms to you and\r\ncalled you,--don’t you hear?”\r\n\r\nShe listened and he listened too, for of course he understood what she\r\nwas trying to say for both. He had felt it as she had, and neither had\r\nsaid it before, and both were certain of an understanding now, wherein\r\nlay the delight and the danger.\r\n\r\n“Once,” Bill said, “I saw four lines which were a little about the\r\nfeeling I mean; do you know them?\r\n\r\n ‘Hail to thee, oh thou Ocean eterne!\r\n Like voices of home thy waters are rushing,\r\n Like visions of childhood saw I a glimmering\r\n Over thy heaving billowy realm.’”\r\n\r\nKit said he did not know the lines and asked whose they were; but she\r\ncould only tell him that she had found them quoted in a book of Mr.\r\nDane’s. “I’ll ask him,” she said; “I dare say he will know, and he\r\nis sure to tell me. He is my great friend, you know, the rector of\r\nAshelton.”\r\n\r\n“Ashelton!” Kit exclaimed. “Do you know Ashelton?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” and then Bill remembered, and the mutual acquaintance with\r\nAshelton and the surrounding district, which seemed so very delightful\r\nto her companion, wore quite another aspect to her. “I had almost\r\nforgotten,” she went on; “I mean, forgotten what I had come to say; but\r\nI must tell you, I will tell you about it.”\r\n\r\nAnd forgetting the poets and the seductive calling of the sea she told\r\nhim all,--of the Australian and his claim, of its strength, and of his\r\ndecision to be silent until after old Mr. Harborough’s death; she told\r\nhim exactly how it stood, and how she thought it unfair he should not\r\nknow what threatened him. He listened quietly as she talked, coldly,\r\nunconsciously demonstrating to her one good gift that an old family\r\nbestows upon its children, the power to receive a blow unmoved, to\r\nhear with the silence of pride and to speak with the indifference of\r\nstudied self-control. Kit Harborough had not much for which to thank\r\nhis ancestors; the dead hand of the past was heavy upon him and the\r\nweight of tradition but little in his favour; nevertheless his birth\r\nand breeding helped him to receive Bill’s blow with a proud composure,\r\nalmost an indifference which roused her deepest admiration, though at\r\nthe same time it touched her curiously.\r\n\r\nShe talked on fast to hide her own feelings. “They seem to think,” she\r\nsaid, though she had said it before and the whole case was painfully\r\nclear now, “they seem to think that if Mr. Harborough is left to\r\nhimself he will not make a will; I don’t know why.”\r\n\r\n“Because he does not like me,” Kit told her.\r\n\r\n“He wishes me to have the property simply on account of the name. I am\r\ncalled Harborough because of the property, and I am,--was to have had\r\nit because of the name; but he wishes it so little that since he is\r\nsure I should have it, he would not set it down.”\r\n\r\n“But if he knew of Theo--of the other one?”\r\n\r\n“He still would not make a will, or if he did it would not be in\r\nmy favour; the other man is a Harborough and so fulfils his only\r\ncondition. I have told you he dislikes me.”\r\n\r\n“He would dislike Theo a good deal more if he knew him,” Bill said\r\nwarmly; “he is going to cut down the wood if he gets the estate, and\r\nplough the land, and grow turnips in the park.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think you could make my uncle believe that.” Kit’s composure\r\nbelied his feelings. “And if one could, if one could induce him to make\r\na will, I don’t believe I should care to do it, and, besides, you know,\r\nit might not make much difference after all. Thank you, thank you very\r\nmuch for telling me,”--the composure was not nearly so marked; stoicism\r\nis not perfect at two-and-twenty; “it was very good of you to do it.\r\nI’m glad to know; it’s much easier when one knows what’s coming, but I\r\ncan’t exactly take advantage of it; you didn’t really mean me to, you\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\n“But the house,” Bill pleaded, “the beautiful, beautiful house! Think\r\nof it, the long west front with the sunset on it,--the great hall with\r\nthe dragons on the mantelpiece--the rooms where all your people were\r\nborn and died!”\r\n\r\n“I know.”\r\n\r\nThey were sitting on a pebbly ridge now; Kit ground his stick into the\r\nshingles and answered in a muffled voice, not looking at her. “But the\r\nthing is not settled yet,” he went on after a pause. “He will have to\r\nfight for it whether there is a will or not; he may not win, and,--and\r\nif he does, they are his people too; he is more really Harborough than\r\nI am.”\r\n\r\n“He does not care for them,” Bill said; “he despises old families and\r\nhe does not care for tradition; he would like the position but he does\r\nnot really care for anything else; he would not love nor understand the\r\nplace a little bit. He would save money, I dare say, perhaps make it,\r\nand in time build up a new family on the old foundation. He is just\r\nfitted to found a new family; he would do it splendidly, he has the\r\nright kind of brains and opinions; but he is not in the least fitted to\r\ncarry on an old name,--he has not been bred up to it or educated for\r\nit. You don’t know him or else you would understand.”\r\n\r\n“I understand very well indeed. But what is the use? Why do you talk\r\nabout it?”\r\n\r\n“Because,” Bill answered vehemently, “the place is what it is; because\r\nof the house and the wood--think of cutting down the wood! Because it\r\nseems so likely he will get it, and if it were mine I would never let\r\nit go. If it had belonged to my people, as it has to yours, I would do\r\nanything--I should not care what--to get it and keep it.”\r\n\r\nThe shingles rattled sharply against one another as Kit moved. “Do\r\nyou think I don’t care?” he asked almost savagely. “But if it is that\r\nbusiness of the will you mean, I can’t do it. I don’t suppose it would\r\nmake a difference, and anyhow I can’t do it; you know I can’t.”\r\n\r\n“Then I will,” Bill said. “I will see Mr. Harborough and explain. I\r\nwill get him to make a will; I believe I could.”\r\n\r\n“No,” Kit exclaimed, “no, you must not do that. It would be no better\r\nthan if I did; it would be taking an unfair advantage of the other\r\nman,--promise me you will not do it.”\r\n\r\nBill hesitated. “I have taken an advantage of him already in telling\r\nyou,” she said.\r\n\r\n“That is different; it was only warning, preparing me for what is to\r\ncome; you were not using your knowledge against the other man; you\r\nwould not do that.”\r\n\r\nBill was not so sure; though, true to her reflective nature, she felt\r\nat the moment that perhaps he was right. “Then you will give it up,”\r\nshe said at last, “you will let a man who does not understand have the\r\nhouse and everything?”\r\n\r\n“Not unless I am compelled.”\r\n\r\n“And will you be compelled? What do you think?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know; it sounds pretty bad as you have told it, of course. It\r\nmay not be; I can’t tell.”\r\n\r\nBill looked hopelessly out to sea. “It is my fault,” she said, more to\r\nherself than to him, “all my fault.”\r\n\r\n“Your fault?” he asked. “How? What have you to do with it?”\r\n\r\n“It was through me that Theo knew of his claim, through the mass in the\r\nHarborough chapel, and it was I who got the mass to be read. Yes, you\r\nhave heard about it, of course, but you did not know it was my doing;\r\nnobody does except one person, but it was, all the same. Mr. Harborough\r\nhad it said to please me, or at least because I suggested it; it was my\r\nidea, and it was all through that service that Theo heard of his claim\r\nto Wood Hall. A man, an antiquary, one of those interfering people who\r\nare always digging in ancestral dust-heaps and finding things which had\r\nmuch better not be found, heard about the service and came to enquire\r\ninto it. He came and he inquired, and poked about, and found out a lot\r\nabout the chapel and the Harboroughs; then he met Theo, and talked to\r\nhim, and found out all about him too. Before that nobody knew anything\r\nof Theo, and he did not know anything of the claim; he never troubled\r\nabout his relationship to you other Harboroughs; but between them he\r\nand Mr. Wagnall pieced it all out, and there you are; that is how he\r\nfound out he had a claim. If it had not been for that mass bringing Mr.\r\nWagnall to Wrugglesby it would never have been discovered; it is all\r\nmy fault.”\r\n\r\nKit did not share this opinion. “It is not your fault,” he said\r\ndecidedly; “not a bit in the world; you never knew what would come of\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“I did it, all the same.”\r\n\r\n“But you are not to blame; you are not responsible because the truth,\r\nif it is the truth, has been found out, and no one would blame you for\r\nit if you were. I don’t think you to blame, and I am the person most\r\nconcerned, after this Theo.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, he doesn’t think I have had anything to do with it,” Bill said,\r\nsmiling a little at the idea.\r\n\r\n“Very well then, that is settled,” Kit said more lightly; “you are\r\nnot to blame; nobody thinks so, neither you, nor I, nor Theo. By the\r\nway, you seem to be very intimate with Theo,--great friends or great\r\nenemies, which is it?”\r\n\r\n“Both,” said Bill smiling; “I am going to marry him.”\r\n\r\nThen suddenly the smile died out of her eyes, out of her heart, out\r\nof sea and sky and world, and for the first time in her life she was\r\nafraid to think.\r\n\r\nKit turned and looked at her full, his well-bred, stoical face\r\nexpressing nothing, only his grave eyes very grave as he said slowly:\r\n“You are going to marry him?”\r\n\r\nShe nodded, meeting his eyes for a minute; and then she looked out to\r\nsea, driving her palms deep among the small pebbles as she sat, one\r\nhand on either side, staring rigidly before her.\r\n\r\nThe gulls dipped down to the breaking waves and circled above in the\r\npale-toned sky; sea and sky alike were as tinted silver, the whole day\r\ndelicate, tender-hued, like the colours found in a pearl. A great\r\npeace, a great silence everywhere; no sound but the ripple of the waves\r\nthat crept up the sand, crept till they reached the shingle where the\r\ngirl sat, and broke with tiny spray almost at her feet.\r\n\r\n“We had better move; the tide is coming up.”\r\n\r\nThe voice of the man beside her aroused her. He suddenly seemed a man\r\nto her, a boy no longer: it seemed too as though there was a great gulf\r\nbetween them. She rose automatically and they walked along the shore in\r\nthe direction of the village. He was very kind and polite; there was an\r\nindefinable difference between his manners and those of the people she\r\nusually met, but it only made her the more conscious of the difference\r\nbetween herself and him. He talked as they went, easily and well, on\r\nindifferent topics, the cliffs, the shore, the places of interest\r\nabout, the peculiarity of the stones on the beach. Once he picked one\r\nup, dark grey and heavy, a flint sea-urchin, he told her it was, rather\r\nan uncommon fossil, he said, as he gave it to her. She took it, and\r\ntalked about it and a dozen other things, in spite of her consciousness\r\nof the gulf, as easy and as self-possessed as he. Why not? Was she not\r\nBill, the mimic, the player’s child? She was sure just then that he had\r\nbeen a player, a strolling mummer, a singer ever on tour, perhaps even\r\nthe circus-clown Polly called him. And she,--she was a clown too, a\r\nbuffoon, a fool, for all that she wore no motley, to make old men laugh\r\nwith her songs and quips, to charm young men for a moment with her\r\nhundred changes,--“all things by turn and nothing long”--nothing except\r\nthe little gipsy creature that was under all and that was miles and\r\nmiles away from Kit Harborough of Bybridge, from him and the women of\r\nhis class. She knew those women, tall, fair, white-skinned, serenely\r\nunconscious. She was a long way from them, from everyone in the\r\nuniverse, farthest of all from this boy with his considerate courtesy,\r\nhis polite speech, his accurate clothes. She was painfully conscious\r\nof his clothes and even more so of her own, of her work-stained hands,\r\nher too rapid movements. She was conscious of it all, but more than all\r\nof a passionate desire to run away and hide with the wild things which\r\nwere her kin, to run away not from him alone but from all her world, to\r\nrun right away into the woods and hide even from herself, if it could\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nBut she did not run away, as she would have done some months earlier;\r\npride held her back and crushed the wild nature down, helping her to\r\npoliteness and teaching her to give her little brown hand at parting\r\nmuch as Kit Harborough did. So with some formality they said good-bye,\r\nand parted at the top of the cliff-path, he to the left to the River\r\nHouse, she to the right to the little shop where Bella was waiting\r\nbreakfast and Polly finishing a belated toilet."

      "content": "THE ACQUISITIVE FACULTY.\r\n\nPolly may have been a clever woman, as Mr. James Brownlow had said\r\nshe was, but in his catalogue of her abilities he omitted to mention\r\nher one great gift, her undeniable talent for getting things. She\r\nwas a true collector and picker-up of trifles; she had brought this\r\ntoo little appreciated art to a rare perfection, and she never went\r\nanywhere without acquiring something, never came home completely\r\nempty-handed, never declined or passed by a single article or\r\nopportunity however trivial or cumbersome. Her motto was _It might be\r\nuseful._ “If she went to the Sahara,” Bill said, “she would bring home\r\nsand for the chickens’ run.” But besides the collectors’ art Polly\r\npossessed the true genius for getting, not begging nor demanding,\r\nbut annexing calmly as by right divine, or acquiring gracefully as\r\nbestowing a favour in accepting one. “I don’t ask for things,” she used\r\nto say; “people always offer them to me. I am sure I don’t know how it\r\nis, but they do, and it looks so rude to refuse.”\r\n\r\nSo she never refused, and seldom went anywhere or met anyone without\r\ndirectly or indirectly turning the occasion to profit. Bymouth did not\r\npromise a very likely field for her abilities, but even here she found\r\nand seized an opportunity. It was late in the visit certainly, not till\r\nafter their fellow-lodgers had gone. This took place on Tuesday, the\r\nday on which Bill told Kit Harborough of the claim.\r\n\r\nThe drawing-room family left at one o’clock, the cousins watching them\r\ngo. They drove to Bybridge in a small wagonette, and it was interesting\r\nto see them getting into it, for the family was large, far too large\r\nfor the wagonette.\r\n\r\n“They will never do it,” Bella said as she watched them.\r\n\r\n“After the way in which they packed into that bedroom,” Polly remarked\r\nseverely, “I should say they could go anywhere or anyhow.”\r\n\r\n“They had two bedrooms,” Bill said; “there was another up the yard.”\r\n\r\n“I call it positively indecent,” was Polly’s opinion, but Bill asked:\r\n“Where is the indecency? The girls were in one and the boys in the\r\nother. Mrs. looked after the girls and Mr. after the boys; they had\r\nmore space apiece than we three have, and I am sure we are all right.”\r\n\r\nPolly explained that their own arrangement was quite different and much\r\nbetter, but Bill, who had now joined Bella at the window, did not pay\r\nany attention to her.\r\n\r\n“Oh, do come and look, Polly,” she said; “they have nearly done it.\r\nThey would do it easily if it were not for the luggage; they ought to\r\nhave a cart for that.”\r\n\r\n“They are far too stingy,” Polly observed contemptuously.\r\n\r\n“The mother will nurse the baby,” Bill went on, “and the father the\r\nnext-sized one, and the little girl that big bundle. They have left one\r\nbox out.”\r\n\r\n“Where will they put it?” Bella said.\r\n\r\n“They can’t get it in front,” was Bill’s opinion; “the coachman can\r\nhardly see round the rampart of luggage as it is. They are going to try\r\nthough. If they would put it inside it could be managed. There it goes!\r\nI knew it would fall off the front! If you were to put it--”\r\n\r\n“Come in, Bill!” Polly seized Bill’s arm. “Come in at once! It is no\r\nbusiness of yours; let people manage their own concerns. I am ashamed\r\nof you!”\r\n\r\nBut Bill was not ashamed of herself; she was far too much absorbed in\r\nthe difficulties of the family to care for Polly, and when someone in\r\nthe wagonette below having heard her voice called up to know what she\r\nhad said, she leaned out of the window again and told them. “Put it\r\ninside; I believe you could do it then,--not that way, small end down.\r\nYou don’t mind me suggesting it, do you? It would have been such a\r\npity” (“Bill!”) “if you couldn’t all get in. That’s right; now” (“Bill!\r\nShut that window, Bella.”) “if the two little boys sit on it and the\r\nbiggest one stands on the step--that’s splendid!”\r\n\r\n“Shut that window, Bella!”\r\n\r\nBella shut the window almost on to Bill’s neck, leaving her no choice\r\nbut to draw her head in. The family, who did not appear to resent her\r\ninterference, shouted their thanks to where she had been, while Bella,\r\nwho had been as much annoyed as Polly by Bill’s behaviour, joined the\r\nelder cousin in telling the culprit so.\r\n\r\nBut Bill did not mind much. “It would have been such a pity if they had\r\nnot managed it,” she said, “and I don’t believe they could any other\r\nway.”\r\n\r\n“It was no affair of yours,” Bella said; “I don’t see why you wanted\r\nto make such an exhibition of yourself. There were people passing too,\r\none of those shooting men from the River House had just come out of the\r\npost-office; he did stare at you, and no wonder!”\r\n\r\nBill said she did not care, which was true; but she did not know that\r\nthe man described the incident, inclusive of her and her directions,\r\nin Kit Harborough’s hearing that evening. Kit recognised her from the\r\ndescription, as Gilchrist had done when his lawyer-friend Ferguson\r\ndescribed her, and Kit, like Gilchrist, did not betray her identity.\r\nHe said even less about her than did Gilchrist, though he experienced\r\na youthful desire to knock the informant down when he announced an\r\nintention of finding out who the girl was. But the pugilistic wish was\r\nrestrained, Kit reflecting that, as Bill was leaving the day after\r\nto-morrow, it was most unlikely the fellow would find out anything\r\nabout her; and, after all, that he should wish to do so was, in Kit’s\r\nopinion, quite natural and only what was to be expected. It was also,\r\nin the same opinion, quite natural that Bill should assist the family\r\nin the wagonette with her advice, quite natural and quite right;\r\nindeed, so right that Kit never questioned its propriety at all,\r\npossibly because she did it; though in his defence it must be said that\r\nhe troubled less about the correctness of an action than did Gilchrist,\r\nthinking not at all of “how it looked.” He had been brought up among\r\npeople who, being quite sure of themselves and their public, never\r\ntroubled as to how a thing might look.\r\n\r\nPolly had not been so brought up, and, conscious that her actions would\r\nnot always bear investigation, she was most anxious that appearances\r\nshould, when possible, be beyond reproach. She lectured Bill\r\nproportionately, and was, as usual, listened to with indifference; but\r\nwhen at last Polly brought her remarks to a close with, “It was like\r\neverything else you do, most unladylike,” Bill said rather wistfully:\r\n“I suppose I am unladylike, Polly?”\r\n\r\n“Hopelessly,” was the crushing answer.\r\n\r\n“I should like to be better,” the voice was a shade more wistful; “I\r\nwould try if I knew what to do.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t lean out of the window to give advice to strangers,” Polly\r\nsaid, and Bill making no reply, she began to perceive that her young\r\ncousin was in an unusually pliant mood. Seeing this she seized the\r\nopportunity, the first that had offered, of speaking to her on her\r\nbehaviour to Gilchrist. As a preliminary she heaved a deep sigh, and,\r\nafter a quick glance at the girl, began with chastened mildness.\r\n\r\n“After all,” she said, “to lean out of the window like that is only a\r\nsmall thing, but it is an illustration of your ways. Your ways often\r\ntrouble me, Bill, do you know that? Sometimes I feel as if I shall\r\ngive you up entirely, and then again sometimes I think you really are\r\nignorant and would try to do better if you only knew how your behaviour\r\nlooked.”\r\n\r\nBill twisted restively, Polly’s voice having taken on the melancholy\r\nsemi-nasal drawl which belonged to her part of the grieved guardian.\r\nBill did not believe in her at any time, and that afternoon the manner\r\nirritated instead of amusing. But she was sincerely convinced of her\r\nown shortcomings, and though she had no great opinion of Polly, there\r\nwas no one else to whom she could go; so she said: “Tell me what I do\r\nwrong; you need not put in all that about being sorry and the rest; I\r\nknow how that goes, and can fill it in for myself.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Bill,” Polly said with dignity; but quickly seeing the\r\ngirl’s attitude of mind and the precariousness of her own opportunity,\r\nshe shortened her part and, after a brief remark on her cousin’s\r\nimpoliteness and her own forbearance, got to business without further\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\n“You want to know where I think you wrong? I will tell you one or two\r\nthings,”--she spoke as one who has a wide range of examples from which\r\nto choose. “There is your behaviour to Gilchrist to begin with; you do\r\nnot behave at all nicely to him.”\r\n\r\n“To Theo!” Bill exclaimed in astonishment, “to him! What do I do wrong\r\nto him?”\r\n\r\n“You call him Theo for one thing; he objects to it and it is\r\nridiculous; all nicknames are ridiculous.”\r\n\r\n“All?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, all; and abbreviations of names are almost as bad.--I don’t see\r\nwhy you should not be called Wilhelmina instead of Bill. It does not\r\nsuit you, it is true, but I am sure he would prefer it, besides Bill is\r\nvulgar; don’t you think so yourself?”\r\n\r\n“He can call me Wilhelmina if he likes,” Bill said in a subdued voice.\r\n“And as for Theo, that is easily altered; He can be Gilchrist if he\r\nwishes it, though I think it is quite as unsuitable as Wilhelmina for\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Bill,”--Polly was delighted to have made so much\r\nimpression--“it is not a question of what you think but of what he\r\nwishes. You ought to consider his wishes; you ought to try to please\r\nhim and consult his tastes; remember, he is proposing to give you a\r\ngreat deal, and as you can give him nothing in return except a little\r\nconsideration, it is hardly right to withhold that as you do.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” Bill’s voice, quiet and cold, was almost like that\r\nof one who faces an unexpected shock.\r\n\r\nPolly, really in her element now, enumerated a list of the things\r\nBill had done wrong, or might have done right, concluding her remarks\r\nwith,--“Try to be pleasant to him, talk seriously when he wants you to,\r\nbe cheerful and lively when he is in the humour for it, put on your\r\nbest dress and try to make yourself nice when he comes. It is your\r\nduty, you know, you owe it to him. Make the most of yourself; don’t set\r\nhim to water the garden and so on, but talk to him and be pleasant.”\r\n\r\n“Always, do you mean?”\r\n\r\nThere was something very like consternation in Bill’s tone, but Polly\r\ndid not know it, and answered readily,--“Yes, of course.”\r\n\r\n“Always?” Bill dropped her hands on the table. “I can’t do it,” she\r\nsaid vehemently; “it is simply no use, Polly, I can’t do it; I shall\r\nhave to throw it up.”\r\n\r\n“Throw what up? What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t be respectable always; it is no use trying; he would be sure\r\nto find me out after we were married, if not before. He knew the sort\r\nof person I was when he asked me to marry him; if he did not like it\r\nwhy did he ask me?”\r\n\r\n“You did not call him Theo before you were engaged,” Polly said, wisely\r\nattacking the details and not the mass of Bill’s protest. “And of\r\ncourse,” she went on, “people usually expect their _fiancées_ will be\r\nnice to them. The average girl does it as a matter of course because\r\nshe wishes to; it is because you do not seem to know what is expected\r\nof you, and never wish to do what is right, that I have had to speak to\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“It is part of the contract, you think?” Bill asked.\r\n\r\n“Certainly not; there is no contract in the matter.”\r\n\r\nSo Polly said, but Bill took her meaning otherwise, as it was intended\r\nshe should, and there was a long silence. Polly, feeling the subject\r\nwas closed, rose and moved about the room, while Bill sat lost in\r\nthought. At last the younger cousin spoke. “I will try to do what is\r\nright,” she said, “I will really. I’ll write to Theo--to Gilchrist this\r\nafternoon, though I did write yesterday. I’ll take the letter out on\r\nthe sands with me.”\r\n\r\nPolly was very much pleased; here was an obvious sign of repentance,\r\nand one moreover which would keep Bill from wading for shrimps, an\r\noccupation she herself strongly disapproved of. She set off for the\r\nshore that afternoon with a really happy mind; she had settled Bill’s\r\naffairs, she had arranged for a good tea when she should come in, and\r\nthe drawing-room family, a great source of annoyance to her, were gone.\r\nShe felt very well pleased with the world in general and herself in\r\nparticular as she sat watching Bill writing her letter, a grotesquely\r\nand pathetically polite letter it was too, if only she had known it.\r\nPolly felt that the stay at Bymouth had been most successful; before\r\nshe finally left she was even more convinced of this, for while at\r\nthe little seaside resort she achieved a piece of business which\r\neven astonished herself. “Fancy,” she used to say with complacency\r\nafterwards, “fancy meeting my future landlord at a little place like\r\nthat!”\r\n\r\nBut this she did in the person of the old gentleman who came to the\r\ndrawing-room floor on Tuesday evening. He only arrived on Tuesday, and\r\nPolly left on Thursday; but she made good use of her time and struck\r\nup a great friendship with him and his wife, sympathising with their\r\nailments, recommending a butcher, telling them in the course of time\r\nsomething of her own difficulties. They were interested, pleased,\r\nfavourably impressed. They gave her a good deal of advice,--this she\r\nasked for but did not necessarily take; they also eventually gave her\r\na little help,--this she did not ask for but, true to her rule, took\r\nwithout hesitation.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman had some house property in London, small\r\nhouses Bayswater way, “a shrewd investment,”--Polly was sure of\r\nit. The tenants had been giving a great deal of trouble lately,\r\n“disgraceful,”--Polly was sympathetic. It was a capital place for\r\napartments, and Polly could not do better than settle in that part when\r\nshe made her “plucky venture;” that was the old gentleman’s advice. One\r\nof the houses was empty now, and before Polly left on Thursday, she was\r\nwarmly pressed to take it on the most advantageous terms; that was the\r\nold gentleman’s offer.\r\n\r\nPolly thanked him in her very best manner, saying she doubly\r\nappreciated his kindness since she was so much alone in the world.\r\nMr. Brownlow had died during the summer, and Polly said at the time\r\nthat it was convenient as they were already in mourning; she said it\r\nwas convenient now, since she was consequently free to conduct her\r\naffairs without his advice and criticism. She did not say this to the\r\nold gentleman, but told him, after thanking him for his offer, that\r\nshe must talk it over with her cousins before finally accepting it;\r\nadding that she was nearly sure of their approval, quite sure of their\r\nobligation on her behalf and their own for his kindness,--and so forth.\r\n\r\nPolly was vastly pleased with herself and detailed the whole affair\r\nwith much satisfaction to the two younger girls as they had a hurried\r\nlunch before starting on their walk to Bybridge station. Bella was\r\nnot at all congratulatory; she did not like having the family affairs\r\ndiscussed with strangers, neither did she like posing as part of\r\nPolly’s responsibilities.\r\n\r\n“I am not,” she said, “and I don’t see why you should say I am. I\r\nam only your cousin and that is no responsibility, and not such a\r\nwonderfully near relationship either.”\r\n\r\n“No,” Polly retorted, “not when you are married to a rich man like Jack\r\nDawson and I let lodgings in town for a bare living; the relationship\r\nwill not be near then, I admit,” and Polly sniffed.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t mean that!” Bella cried; “Oh, you are unkind! I don’t look\r\ndown on you and I never shall; it is with your cadging ways that I hate\r\nto be mixed up.”\r\n\r\n“Polly is a born cadger,” Bill said resignedly, “and we are part of her\r\nstock in trade. She is like a beggar-woman singing in the street and\r\nnever asking for pennies, but always getting them. I am her hired baby\r\nand you are her imitation cough; she would not get on nearly so well\r\nwithout us.”\r\n\r\n“Well, at all events you reap the benefit of what I get,” Polly said.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” Bill agreed readily.\r\n\r\n“And I don’t think, Bill, that you will ever despise me.” Polly’s tone\r\nwas becoming highly moral. “It is a great comfort to me to think that\r\nwhen you leave me and marry you will never look down on or ignore me.\r\nIt is true you will never have Bella’s temptation, but I am sure you\r\nwould not do it.”\r\n\r\n“You are unkind!” Bella repeated. But Bill’s face had suddenly\r\nhardened; she was thinking of Gilchrist and Wood Hall and the county\r\nwho were going to be compelled to recognise him and his wife,--his wife\r\nwho would have to reform and perhaps forget.\r\n\r\n“No,” she said suddenly, almost passionately; “I will never forget you,\r\nPolly, never look down on you, never, no matter where I am, nor what I\r\nbecome. If I lived in a palace you should come and stay with me; if I\r\nmarried a king he should receive you and take you in to dinner, and all\r\nthe silly courtiers should bow down to you because you were mine. You\r\nare an old fraud, Polly, and a cadger, and a bit of a humbug too, but I\r\nam fond of you all the same. We are not swells, you and I, but we will\r\nstand by each other, and I will never, never forget!”\r\n\r\n“That is a very nice spirit,” Polly said impressively and very much\r\nthrough her nose.\r\n\r\n“Do you think I would forget?” Bella asked rather hurt. “You seem to\r\nthink I am a horrid creature.”\r\n\r\n“No, we don’t,” Bill answered her, “of course we don’t; we know really\r\nthat you never would be ashamed of your grubby relations. Don’t let us\r\ntalk any more nonsense about it.”\r\n\r\nSo peace was restored, and Polly began cutting slices of the cold\r\nshoulder of mutton while the younger girls finished their lunch.\r\n\r\n“If you married a king,” Bella said to Bill laughing, “he might object\r\nto Polly walking up to the palace with a nosebag of apples sticking out\r\nof the middle of her mackintosh.”\r\n\r\n“Not if he had married me; he would have got used to that sort of\r\nthing.”\r\n\r\nBella laughed again. “It is a good thing your Theo is not very\r\nparticular about appearances.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t know very much about Theo,” Bill answered quietly.\r\n\r\n“I know this much,” Bella replied; “he will not let you do just as you\r\nlike if it happens to be something he does not like and has good reason\r\nto think wrong.”\r\n\r\n“There may be difficulties,” Bill admitted with the glimmer of a smile,\r\nher war-smile which Polly knew to her cost.\r\n\r\n“Bill is very easy to manage when you understand her,” that lady said\r\nas she sharpened her knife. “Gilchrist will find out how to do it in\r\ntime; at least he may.”\r\n\r\nShe added the last words under her breath, neither of the others\r\nhearing her, for Bella was asking in astonishment: “You would never\r\nreally oppose a man you loved, would you, Bill?”\r\n\r\nBill debated the question for a moment looking straight before her.\r\n“No,” she said at last, “I suppose I should not.” Then she changed the\r\nsubject abruptly: “What is that meat for, Polly?”\r\n\r\n“To take home with us. I am not going to leave all that good meat\r\nbehind; there is quite enough now on the bone to look decent, and it\r\nwould be a great pity to leave all this.”\r\n\r\nBella did not approve of this proceeding, but Polly, untroubled by her\r\nobjections, packed the meat up. “There,” she said, giving the parcel\r\na final pat, “it will come in very nicely for our supper when we get\r\nhome, and I am sure there is quite a lot on the joint still.”\r\n\r\nBill examined it gravely. “There is enough for our cat here,” she said:\r\n“it seems a pity to leave that. Let’s take it; we haven’t time to\r\nscrape it off, but you might put the bone in your hat-box; it would go\r\nin if I broke it in half.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be ridiculous, Bill,” Polly said with dignity, “ridiculous and\r\nmean. I don’t see anything to laugh at, Bella.”\r\n\r\nApparently Bella did, but Polly never minded being laughed at, and it\r\nwas in a friendly fashion that the three cousins started for home.\r\nIn the main the three agreed admirably; Bella seldom opposed Polly,\r\nand Bill, since she had developed an opposing individuality, had been\r\nlittle with them; moreover, she was of a nature with which it was not\r\neasy to quarrel. Polly, however, having a respect for her ability to\r\ngive trouble on occasions, sent her back to Theresa at Ashelton two\r\ndays after their return to Wrugglesby. “I have got a lot of things to\r\nsettle,” she explained to Bella, “and I can do them better without her.”"

      "content": "POLLY SETTLES THINGS.\r\n\nSo Bill was packed off to Ashelton, and then Polly proceeded to settle\r\nthings to her own complete satisfaction. She saw the house in Bayswater\r\nand settled that; she saw the parents of the few pupils remaining\r\nto her and settled them very completely; and then she wound up her\r\nconnection with Wrugglesby with but few difficulties and not a single\r\nregret.\r\n\r\n“Well, I cannot say I ever cared for it,” she said when Bella expressed\r\nsome natural sorrow at leaving the town which had been her home for\r\nnearly seven years. “I never was fitted for a pokey little place like\r\nthis; I need a wider life.”\r\n\r\n“It may be pokey,” Bella declared with tears in her eyes, “but I like\r\nit, and I am sorry to leave it, and to leave the shabby old house and\r\nthe shabby old furniture.”\r\n\r\n“We are not leaving the furniture,” Polly said quickly. “We are taking\r\nall we want with us, and only selling what is of no use to any of us.\r\nYou and Theresa have each chosen what you wanted; one can’t keep all\r\nthe rubbish.”\r\n\r\nThe last was added very decidedly, for there had been some discussion\r\nabout the furniture. Bella had fallen in quietly enough with Polly’s\r\njudicious arrangements, but Bill, who cherished ridiculous sentiments\r\nabout old and cumbersome articles of furniture, had disputed Polly’s\r\ndecision article by article, winning sometimes, losing sometimes, and\r\nonly desisting when it was obvious that the little house at Bayswater\r\ncould hold no more. All this had taken place during the visits she and\r\nTheresa occasionally paid the cousins at Wrugglesby during the time\r\nof the settlement. It was all over now, arranged finally some days\r\nago; Polly was only afraid of reopening the question. The three were\r\nassembled for the last time at Langford House, Robert having driven\r\nBill to Wrugglesby that afternoon to see the last of the old place\r\nand the old associations. There was nothing at all to be done, it\r\nwas really nonsense for her to come, Polly said, and was not at all\r\nsurprised that Bill did not arrive till almost dark.\r\n\r\nRobert had been delayed in starting, and when Wrugglesby was reached\r\nBill would not be driven to the house, but got down from the dog-cart\r\nat the stables and walked, with something clinking forgotten in her\r\npocket, down the familiar streets, saying a silent good-bye. It was a\r\ngrey, gusty afternoon, the first of October. There were dead leaves\r\nin the quiet corners,--all the corners were quiet here--and the wind\r\ncame now and then whirling them about her feet. It was a good wind,\r\nfresh and sweet for all its strength, and the girl felt she loved it;\r\nit was the home-wind to her, the wind of the Eastern Counties. And the\r\ngreyness and the peace and the great sense of space and abundant room\r\nwere home to her, the land of the Eastern Counties, not grand at all,\r\nbut still and wide, and very, very dear.\r\n\r\nShe stood a moment on the outskirts of the little town looking across\r\nthe well remembered country. Then she turned and walked home through\r\nthe small, ill-paved streets, past the familiar shops,--those with\r\nthe new fronts, those with the old many-paned windows; past the\r\npolice-station, the Georgian house with the legend _County Police_ set\r\nover the door; past the church with its ancient burying-ground where,\r\nfive steps above the town, Aunt Isabel slept under the dark green grass\r\nand fluttering sycamore leaves; past genteel houses with small gardens\r\nwhere sunflowers lingered with hollyhocks and dahlias still unhurt by\r\nfrost; past each familiar thing until at last, just as the lamps in the\r\ntown were being lighted, Langford House was reached.\r\n\r\nBut the cousins who received her knew nothing of Bill’s lonely walk,\r\nnor yet of the something which clinked in her pocket. Indeed, she\r\nherself did not think of the last immediately; she did not think of\r\nit until after Bella had made the remark on her regret at leaving\r\nWrugglesby. Bill did not speak of her regret, and as for Polly, she had\r\nnone of which to speak. “As we have got to go some time,” she said, “it\r\nmay as well be now as later; better in fact, for though the lease is\r\nnot up till Christmas, we could not expect to get such another chance\r\nof a house as the one now offered.”\r\n\r\nTo which wisdom Bella assented; after all, leaving the house now did\r\nnot concern her so very much, for in any circumstances she would have\r\nhad to leave before the spring, as Jack insisted that they should be\r\nmarried in February. Mrs. Dawson, though she had at first objected\r\nto this arrangement, finally came to the conclusion that since it\r\nwas inevitable it might as well be soon as late. Indeed after a time\r\nshe came to accept it with so much meekness (other people called it\r\npleasure) that she invited Bella to come to Greys when Polly left\r\nWrugglesby and stay there till the winter set in. Therefore Bella,\r\nthough she assented to them, cannot be said to have had a very personal\r\ninterest in Polly’s plans.\r\n\r\nAs for Bill, on this particular afternoon she said nothing even with\r\nregard to the furniture, except that in reply to Polly’s emphatic\r\nremark to the effect that they could not take all the rubbish with\r\nthem, she said she hoped it would get a good home and be well treated.\r\nPolly considered such sentiments foolish in the extreme and, having\r\nsaid so, dismissed the subject from her mind and remarked: “I flatter\r\nmyself that we have done very well on the whole.”\r\n\r\nBella agreed, but Bill corrected. “It is not we but you who have done\r\nit. It was you who cadged the house in London on very low terms, you\r\nwho first impressed Mrs. Dawson with the fact that we are a nice\r\nfamily,--oh yes, she likes Bella for herself now, but she began by\r\nliking you, or rather what she takes you to be. You arranged that, just\r\nas you arranged the contract for the repairs of this house at the end\r\nof the lease. You are a champion cadger, Polly, whatever else you are.”\r\n\r\nPolly was not certain whether to be pleased or offended by this\r\ntribute. “I think you have a great deal to thank me for,” she said\r\ncomplacently; “I am glad you appreciate it, though I object to the word\r\n_cadger_.”\r\n\r\n“What shall I say?” Bill asked, “If you don’t cadge things what do you\r\ndo? Acquire them?”\r\n\r\n“Well, yes, perhaps I do,” Polly admitted; “yes, I suppose I have the\r\nacquisitive faculty.”\r\n\r\n“I should say you have.”\r\n\r\n“So have you,”--Polly did not like Bill’s tone. “I am sure you have it;\r\npeople give you things and you don’t refuse them.”\r\n\r\nBill laughed and went over to the fireplace, the something in her\r\npocket clinking audibly as she moved.\r\n\r\n“What is that?” asked the inquisitive Polly.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I had forgotten.” Bill put her hand into her pocket. “It is\r\nsomething I brought to show you,” she said, and drew out first a piece\r\nof crumpled paper in which the articles had been wrapped and then two\r\nlarge old-fashioned shoe-buckles.\r\n\r\n“What are they?” Polly made a pounce on one.\r\n\r\n“Where did you get them?” Bella took the other from the table where\r\nBill had put them. “What are they?”\r\n\r\nThey gleamed in the fading light as the cousins held them, gleamed\r\nand shimmered with wonderful changing splendour, flashing when the\r\nfirelight touched them and found a dozen answering tongues of flame.\r\n\r\n“Paste,” Polly said, “old paste; they must be worth a lot of money.”\r\n\r\n“Diamonds,” Bill corrected.\r\n\r\n“Diamonds? Nonsense! They might be worth as much as a hundred pounds\r\napiece if they were!”\r\n\r\n“They are diamonds,” Bill persisted, “though they can’t be worth that.\r\nThey are mine.”\r\n\r\n“Yours?” Polly almost screamed. “Diamonds--and yours? Talk about the\r\nacquisitive faculty!”\r\n\r\nBill flushed. “I did not acquire them,” she said rather illogically;\r\n“at least, I hated to have them, and I have promised to give them\r\nto somebody as a wedding-present, not yet, some day, when there is a\r\nwedding. I will give them back,--I don’t care what you say,--you need\r\nnot think about selling them,--they are not going to be sold.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t talk nonsense to me,” was Polly’s answer. “If they are diamonds\r\nthey shall be sold, that is, if you have any right to them, which I am\r\nsure you have not. They must be paste!”\r\n\r\nBill took the buckle out of her hand, Bella placing the fellow on the\r\ntable beside it: “Are they really diamonds?” she asked. “How did you\r\ncome by them, and whose were they?”\r\n\r\nBill stood looking at them a moment as they flashed in the firelight.\r\n“They were Peter Harborough’s shoe-buckles,” she said."

      "content": "PETER HARBOROUGH’S SHOE-BUCKLES.\r\n\nPolly had no doubt done wisely in sending Bill to Ashelton while she\r\nherself was settling affairs at Wrugglesby. Not only was she thus freed\r\nfrom Bill’s interference, but also Bill had an opportunity for putting\r\ninto practice her good resolutions regarding Gilchrist Harborough.\r\nPolly was sure she would make use of the opportunity, for Bill could\r\nalways be relied on to keep her word. In the main she fulfilled Polly’s\r\nexpectations; she certainly tried to do so. Theresa found her curiously\r\nsubdued on her return to Ashelton, and found also that she herself was\r\nwatched and sometimes imitated with an embarrassing closeness. Bill was\r\ntrying to be a lady.\r\n\r\nShe obeyed to the letter Polly’s instructions concerning Gilchrist,\r\nalways putting on her best dress for his coming, never calling him\r\nTheo now, never baffling him by tantalising moods and goblin mockery\r\nand playful defiance. Indeed so circumspect was her behaviour that\r\nGilchrist not unnaturally concluded that the lecture he had given\r\nher after the affair of the plums had taken effect. Of course he was\r\nhumanly gratified to find that his words had not been wasted, but it\r\nis to be feared that he found Bill in her new character of lady, as\r\ncopied from Theresa, something of a disappointment; she did not always\r\ncompare favourably with her model.\r\n\r\nBill did not know how her efforts impressed Gilchrist, neither did she\r\ngreatly care, for his opinion was not her highest standard. But she was\r\nherself by no means satisfied, and one day, soon after her return to\r\nAshelton, she took her difficulties to her friend the rector. He, by\r\nright of his office and reason of his experience, had been consulted\r\non many points in his time, some rather peculiar ones since his\r\nacquaintance with Bill; but even she had never faced him with anything\r\nquite so unexpected as on the day when she brought him the problem of\r\nher own behaviour. She was examining the high shelves of his book-case\r\nat the time, standing on the back of an arm-chair to do so, having\r\nfirst weighted the seat with encyclopaedias.\r\n\r\n“THE DIARY OF A LADY,” she read the title of one of the books, then\r\nstood a moment looking at it thoughtfully. “Monseigneur,” she said,\r\n“you know I told you I was trying to behave better? Well, I am not\r\ngetting on a bit.”\r\n\r\nMr. Dane was busy with his parish accounts; as a rule the girl’s\r\npresence did not disturb him at all, but now he looked up, arrested by\r\nher tone.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” he asked, putting down his pen. “What have you been\r\ndoing?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing; I haven’t done anything wrong and I do all the right things I\r\ncan find to do. Theresa thinks I am much improved, but I’m not really.”\r\nAs she reached up to replace the book, the chair tilted a little.\r\n“Would you mind kneeling on the seat?” she said. “The chair tips when I\r\nreach up. Thank you.”\r\n\r\nShe jumped to the ground and drawing a chair to the writing-table faced\r\nthe rector. “What is your notion of a lady?” she asked abruptly.\r\n\r\nMr. Dane considered a moment, before hazarding an opinion, knowing that\r\nhis answer would be taken literally and perhaps translated into action.\r\n“One,” he said at length, “who considers others, who never by word\r\nor deed causes unnecessary pain, who listens sympathetically, talks\r\npleasantly, never says a great deal even when she feels much or knows\r\nmore. One who does her mental and moral washing in private, but is not\r\nafraid to do her duty in public; who respects the secrets of others,\r\nthe honour of her family, and her own self more than all. One who\r\nspeaks with tact, acts with discretion, and places God before fashion\r\nwithout needlessly advertising the fact to the annoyance of the rest of\r\nthe world.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said Bill, and a long silence followed; perhaps she was\r\nlearning the definition for her own benefit. At last she spoke again.\r\n“You think I could be a lady if I learned to control myself and,--and\r\ndid not run away when I wanted to, and all those sorts of things?”\r\n\r\nMr. Dane did think so; possibly he did not regard her as so hopeless a\r\ncase as did Polly. Then there was another silence during which there\r\ncame the sound of wheels on the drive at the other side of the house.\r\nNeither noticed it, and Bill, thinking of Polly’s lectures on her\r\ndisreputable appearance, asked a second question. “I suppose a lady\r\nalways wants to look right? It matters very much how she looks, how she\r\nis dressed?”\r\n\r\n“It matters very much for some,” the rector answered; “but others--”\r\nhe was only a man after all, and though old not altogether wise--“with\r\nothers,” he said, “you are so busy wondering what colour their eyes\r\nare that you never notice their gowns; so much perplexed as to what\r\nthey are, Princess Puck, that you never know what they wear--”\r\n\r\nHe broke off smiling as the housekeeper opened the door: “A gentleman\r\nto see Miss Alardy,” she announced.\r\n\r\n“Me?” Bill exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Yes, miss; he has been to Haylands, he says, and they told him you\r\nwere here; he’s waiting in the hall now,--young Mr. Harborough.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Harborough?” Bill repeated rising. “Whatever can he want?”\r\n\r\n“Not Mr. Harborough from Crows’ Farm,” the housekeeper explained;\r\n“young Mr. Harborough from Wood Hall.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!--I’ll come and speak to him.”\r\n\r\nLadies controlled themselves; they said nothing even when they felt\r\nmuch; they respected themselves, the honour of their family, the\r\nsecrets of their friends. Bill was going to be a lady, and she would\r\nnot even allow herself to feel surprised.\r\n\r\nMr. Dane took up his pen again. Old Mr. Harborough was worse no doubt;\r\nhe had been ill all the week, and that it was a mere question of days\r\neveryone knew. Probably it was a question of hours now, and for that\r\nreason they had summoned the heir. And for what reason had the heir\r\ncome for Bill? If old Mr. Harborough had a fancy for seeing her again\r\nbefore he died Mr. Dane was not the man to gainsay him. Bill knew that,\r\nthe instant he came into the hall where she stood with Kit Harborough.\r\n\r\n“Go, by all means,” was his advice, “go at once; I will explain to Mrs.\r\nMorton.”\r\n\r\nSo Bill fetched her hat from the study where it lay on the\r\nencyclopaedias, and without another word drove away with Kit to Wood\r\nHall. And Mr. Dane had time to finish his accounts and then explain\r\nmatters to Theresa before lunch.\r\n\r\nTheresa was very much surprised to hear of Bill’s going, but since the\r\nrector approved she was quite willing to do the same. As the afternoon\r\nwore on and Bill did not return, she began to wonder a little what the\r\ngirl was doing; and when in the evening Gilchrist called and Bill was\r\nstill absent, she found the situation rather awkward. Gilchrist showed\r\nsuch an unreasonable displeasure at her absence that Theresa wished\r\nMr. Dane could have explained to the impatient lover the propriety\r\nand justice of Bill’s going. To tell the truth, Gilchrist was both\r\ndispleased and anxious, for he did not feel at all sure what Bill might\r\nbe saying with regard to the Wood Hall estate. She had told him how\r\nshe had met and warned Kit Harborough at Bymouth; and though it is\r\ntrue that she had listened with commendable humility to his natural\r\nexplosion of anger, and at the end had assured him (with the shadow of\r\ncontempt in her voice) that the heir had declined to take advantage\r\nof the warning, what guarantee was there that she might not, for some\r\nreason of her own, think fit to warn the old man in time to create\r\nunnecessary complications? Gilchrist was very uneasy indeed, not at all\r\nsure what Bill would do.\r\n\r\nBut Kit had no doubts at all. He was perfectly sure she would say\r\nnothing; and, as certain of her as he was of himself, he never once\r\nduring the drive to Gurnett reopened the question of the claim. He\r\nnever even mentioned it when he helped her to alight at the great door,\r\nnever spoke of it or referred to it as he led her across the echoing\r\nhall to the wide stairs and the rooms above.\r\n\r\nOld Harborough was dying, but dying elegantly, almost as if with a\r\nsubtle and unconscious recollection of what was due to the traditions\r\nof his family. He was powerless in body but terribly alert in mind,\r\nkeenly conscious of the situation and accepting the inevitable with the\r\ncynicism he had shown to so many of the happenings of his life, neither\r\ncurious nor afraid, politely indifferent, almost politely sceptical.\r\nBill, the many-sided, the sympathetic, felt something like a touch of\r\nadmiration for this survival of a passing type. He, on his part, feeble\r\nas he was, still received her with something of his former mocking\r\ncourtesy, thanked her for troubling to come to him, apologised for the\r\nmanner of her reception, and prayed her to be seated.\r\n\r\nThere was a nurse present when Bill entered the room, a tall, quiet\r\nwoman who looked curiously at the girl. The man who had met Mr.\r\nHarborough with the chair that April day in the woods was also present;\r\nbut he did not look curiously at Bill, either because he thought it\r\nbad manners, or else because he understood her claim to his master’s\r\ninterest. Both of them, however, withdrew to a more distant part of the\r\nlarge room. Kit remained standing near the bed, but Mr. Harborough took\r\nno notice of him, only once indirectly acknowledging his presence and\r\nthen in no pleasant manner; it was when he himself apologised to Bill\r\nfor not handing her to a chair.\r\n\r\n“You must take the will for the deed,” he said, “since I cannot do\r\nit; it is clear such trifling attentions will not survive the old\r\ngeneration.”\r\n\r\nHe did not look at Kit, nevertheless the lad coloured hotly. Bill\r\nsat down, wondering a little how the old manners would suit the\r\nnew generation; but she did not say so and in a minute she dropped\r\nthe thought out of her mind, turning her entire attention on Mr.\r\nHarborough. She did not find it difficult to talk to him, though Kit\r\nwas a listener, even when the old man referred to her last visit and\r\nthe offer then made she felt little embarrassment.\r\n\r\n“Are you not sorry you did not take it?” he asked her. “I’d have left\r\nyou Wood Hall for as long as you remained a Harborough. Pity it was\r\nnot done! It might have saved the old place; an heiress isn’t always\r\nthe only thing or the best thing to mend a broken family.” He seemed\r\nalmost to be speaking to himself, but he addressed her directly when he\r\nasked abruptly: “Are you not sorry you did not take it? By this time\r\nto-morrow it would all have been yours.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want it,” she answered him vehemently. “I don’t want it; I\r\nwould hate to have it!”\r\n\r\n“Hate to have it? Why, I thought you liked it?”\r\n\r\n“I do, so much that I would hate to have it.”\r\n\r\nA priest had come quietly into the room, but, seeing Mr. Harborough\r\nengaged in conversation, he went to a distant window and opened a book\r\nhe carried. Bill recognised him at once for the same man who had read\r\nthe mass at Ashelton Church. Mr. Harborough followed her eyes but, not\r\nbeing aware that she recognised him, thought she was only wondering as\r\nto the reason of his presence.\r\n\r\n“The last relic of the Catholic faith here,” he explained in his weak\r\nharsh voice. “I have to be dressed for the next world, the last of us\r\nwho ever will be. Kit is not a Catholic; he is a Purist or a Deist\r\nor something sincere and modern. He troubles about his soul and his\r\nCreator like any other mental dyspeptic, and believes something on his\r\nown account. When I was young it was thought ill-bred to interfere with\r\nthe concerns of the Almighty, and the minding of souls was left to\r\nthose who were paid to do it. We were not tied down by a Sunday-school\r\nmorality in those days, and we had the courage of our convictions.”\r\n\r\nBill nodded. “I know,” she said.\r\n\r\n“How do you know?” he asked sharply.\r\n\r\n“By you,” she answered.\r\n\r\n“By me? What have I said to you? What do you know?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t exactly explain,” she said doubtfully; “only the world was\r\ndifferent then. One can’t measure you by the people of to-day, nor the\r\npeople of to-day by you.”\r\n\r\nHe fixed her with eyes which were still keen. “How do you know that?”\r\nhe persisted.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know; I suppose I feel it.”\r\n\r\n“You are a lenient judge,” he said almost softly, “about the most\r\nlenient judge I have ever had, you odd child. What an odd child! I did\r\nnot know how odd the day I found you in the wood, the day you found God\r\nin the wood; you did find Him, did you not?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she answered simply. “He seemed very close; but then I think the\r\ndevil was too.”\r\n\r\n“God and the devil at your right elbow and your left. A survival of\r\nPuritan days,--to find God in the woods now!”\r\n\r\nThe tone was not wholly mocking; there was a touch of wistfulness\r\nin it, and Bill hearing it answered it from the depth of her own\r\nconvictions. “Everywhere it is beautiful one feels God,” she said\r\nsoftly, “in forest and sea and sky.” She raised her eyes and met Kit’s.\r\nHe may have been guilty of a Sunday-school morality; he certainly was\r\nguilty of a belief, and he betrayed its existence then to one who\r\nshared it.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Harborough did not know it; he was not thinking of Kit at all\r\nas he lay looking curiously at the girl. His lips moved once: “Shall\r\nsee God,” he said as if to himself, then raising his voice slightly he\r\nasked: “Who is it that shall see God, Father Clement?”\r\n\r\nThe priest turned. “‘Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see\r\nGod,’” he answered drawing nearer.\r\n\r\n“The pure in heart,” Mr. Harborough repeated, “that is it; I had\r\nforgotten. Well, little witch, you have seen something that I, for\r\nall my years and experience, have not; something that I--I suppose\r\nbecause of those years and experience--cannot see. But now I must ask\r\nyou to go; there is a heavenly toilet to be made. Go down and get some\r\nlunch, but come back by-and-bye. Kit must take you; I apologise for him\r\nbeforehand.”\r\n\r\nBill rose. “Kit does not need anyone’s apology,” she said hotly; then\r\nshe followed the young man out of the room feeling ashamed. Kit that\r\nday was like the Kit of Bymouth, the Kit she had met in the lane; there\r\ndid not seem such a gulf between them as when they parted, nor yet such\r\nterrible courtesy. They were boy and girl in the great house together,\r\nboy and girl watching together, by an odd chain of circumstances, for\r\nthe coming of the great shadow. They went to the solemn old dining-room\r\nand lunched in state as Bill had once lunched with Mr. Harborough.\r\nDuring the meal Kit did not mention to his guest the subject which\r\nhad never really been absent from his mind since she herself first\r\nput it there that morning on the sands at Bymouth. A little while\r\nback he had had some talk with a solicitor of his acquaintance, and\r\nwithout betraying a personal interest in the test-case he described,\r\nhad learned the very serious position of the man placed as he was. But\r\nhe did not speak of it to Bill then, although, in spite of the still\r\nintangible nature of it all, he felt the shadow of this man from the\r\nnew country spread over the stately old house, filling its most secret\r\ncorners, taking possession of its most sacred spots. And Bill, though\r\nhe did not speak of it, knew the thought that was in her companion’s\r\nmind, and felt with him this haunting presence.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch the doctor and nurse agreed in forbidding either Kit or his\r\nguest to see the patient before four o’clock, saying that they should\r\nbe summoned then unless some unexpected change made their presence\r\nnecessary earlier. There were nearly two hours before them, two hours\r\nfor Kit to play host in the house which might soon pass to another.\r\nWith an effort he tried to banish the thought from his mind as he asked\r\nBill to come to the library.\r\n\r\n“This is the room I like best,” he said when they stood in the great\r\nlow room where some past Harborough had gathered a store of books.\r\nMercifully the later comers, not thinking them of sufficient value to\r\nsell, had left them intact, even, indeed, adding a volume now and then,\r\neach man according to his taste, for there was no lack of intellect\r\neven among the wildest of them. The September sunlight slanted\r\nthrough the broad low windows where weedy sunflowers and uncut trails\r\nof late-blooming roses looked in on a big room, irregular in shape,\r\nfull of angles, with bookshelves jutting out in unexpected places,\r\nand a silence in it which was a luxury of the brain. The light was a\r\nwarm brown gloom cast back from book-lined shelves; the smell was the\r\nwonderful, indescribable smell of an old library, Russia leather, and\r\noak shelves, and book-dust blended into one, a perfume never to be\r\nforgotten. For, as the rose on his mistress’s bosom to a lover, or the\r\nbreath of the clover which filled the air when he pledged his vows, so\r\nis the smell of such a library to the man of books, and above all, to\r\nthe man who has been reared to it, the man who has learned by common\r\nuse and childish association to love the outside of the volumes before\r\never he could read them within.\r\n\r\nBill felt her breast heave suddenly, and a great lump came in her\r\nthroat. She had never been in such a library before, never to her\r\nknowledge smelt its sweet familiar smell, yet her breast heaved and she\r\ncould not speak. It was absurd, of course; it was nothing to her, the\r\nbooks were not her friends, and as an alien she could claim no kinship\r\nwith them; yet she felt for them, felt so that she could not speak. As\r\nfor Kit, he had followed her into the room and stretched out a hand to\r\nset straight a book on a lower shelf, but he did not touch it; his hand\r\ndropped and he turned abruptly to a window, and for a long minute both\r\nstood silent, not regarding one another. Then Bill mastered herself\r\nwith an effort.\r\n\r\n“What is this?” she asked, taking a book at random.\r\n\r\nIt was Sir Thomas Brown’s VULGAR ERRORS, an old folio edition with\r\nwonderful woodcuts. Kit looked at it for a moment, though he knew it\r\nwell enough, and then recovering himself he told her. They took the\r\nbook to the broad window-sill and together turned its pages, looking\r\nat the curious pictures. After that he took down another book and then\r\nanother; Bill was sitting on the window-sill now, the books piled\r\nbeside her, while Kit drew a great wooden chair in front. In this way\r\nhe showed her a Chaucer massively bound and clamped with brass, a Pope\r\nof 1717, a PILGRIM’S PROGRESS grotesquely illustrated,--the books he\r\nloved, wonderful old German prints, poets of a later date, and stout\r\nold sermon-writers with whose solid works he had built houses in\r\nchildish days.\r\n\r\nSo the afternoon passed with strange pleasure to both, though neither\r\nquite forgot the shadow that hung over the house, nor the even deeper\r\nshadow not only of death, that brooded over the library and in some\r\nunexplained way touched every book they looked at and every passage\r\nthey read. Once Kit took down a Milton, old and shabby and unopened,\r\nexcept by himself, for many years, and began to read a passage from IL\r\nPENSEROSO.\r\n\r\n “Oft on a plat of rising ground\r\n I hear the far-off curfew sound,\r\n Over some well watered shore,\r\n Swinging slow--”\r\n\r\nHe stopped abruptly; each heard the curfew as on that night, each smelt\r\nthe scent of the wet grass in the lane. There was a pause when neither\r\nlooked at the other; then he went on hurriedly, a little lower down the\r\npage:\r\n\r\n “Some still removèd place will fit,\r\n Where glowing embers through the room\r\n Teach light to counterfeit a gloom--”\r\n\r\nKit shut the book sharply and gave it up. All round him lay the heaped\r\nup volumes as they used to lie on the winter afternoons when he had\r\nbuilt towers with the works of the divines in that same glowing gloom.\r\nHe glanced at the wide fireplace; Bill had glanced at it before him,\r\nbecause she too had thought of it, though she had never seen it when\r\nthe fire burned low at twilight. So they each looked, and then each\r\nlooked at the other and neither, for all their resolutions, hid the\r\nthought nor pretended to hide it. Bill’s throat began to swell again. A\r\nvolume of Hooker, balanced on the window-sill, fell with a thud to the\r\nfloor. Kit took a long time in picking it up, and when at last he put\r\nit in a place of safety with Marcus Aurelius on the top, he said: “He\r\nwould love the books.”\r\n\r\nIt was perfectly unnecessary to explain who _he_ was; Bill knew and\r\nthought of Gilchrist’s tastes and bookshelf before she answered: “Yes,\r\nI think he would.” She picked up the MEDITATIONS. “He has got this,”\r\nshe said; “his is in English, though, bound in green cloth, and cost\r\none and sixpence. I believe he would like his own edition better; it is\r\ncheaper and clearer.”\r\n\r\nKit silently took the imperial philosopher from the girl’s hand, as\r\nshe got down from the window-seat and helped him to put the books back\r\nin their places. Neither spoke of Gilchrist again; and a little later\r\nsomeone came to fetch them to Mr. Harborough.\r\n\r\nThey went up-stairs together and quietly into the old man’s room. Bill\r\nnoticed a difference directly she entered; she needed no one to tell\r\nher that she had been called to say good-bye to the eccentric old man\r\nshe had so little known.\r\n\r\n“Come here,” he said hoarsely when he saw her hesitate near the door.\r\n\r\nShe came and stood close to him, Kit standing on the other side of the\r\nbed.\r\n\r\n“Here’s a keepsake for you,” he whispered, trying to raise his\r\nnerveless hand. “I give it you in the presence of witnesses,” he\r\nglanced at the nurse as he spoke, “so there will be no dispute\r\nafterwards. It is not an heirloom, and I can do with it as I like. Put\r\nyour hand on mine, take it, here.”\r\n\r\nBill put her hand in his as requested and the cold powerless fingers\r\nbeneath her warm touch fumbled feebly before the two glittering buckles\r\nfell into her hand.\r\n\r\n“There,” he said triumphantly, “they are for you; that is, if you will\r\ndo me the favour of accepting them.”\r\n\r\n“For me?” she said gazing half bewildered, half fascinated by the\r\nbrilliancy of the stones.\r\n\r\n“Yes, for you,” Mr. Harborough told her. “They are yours now, the gift\r\nis witnessed,” he went on, for she hardly seemed to realise the fact.\r\nThen she stooped and kissed the hand that gave them.\r\n\r\n“They were Peter Harborough’s shoe-buckles,” he whispered, “about the\r\nonly thing he did not lose at cards; he lost everything else even\r\nincluding--” there was a little cough for breath--“including his life.\r\nMy father left them to me; they are my own; I can do with them as I\r\nlike, and I like to give them to you. They are all the diamonds we have\r\nnow and,” addressing Kit with a sudden access of spite, “no wife of\r\nyours can have them now.”\r\n\r\nBill dropped the buckles as if they had burnt her; they fell with a\r\nclink on the counterpane and lay there, a sparkle of light. “I can’t\r\ntake them,” she said. “I won’t have them; you--you don’t understand.”\r\n\r\nKit leaned across and, picking them up, gently gave the buckles back to\r\nher. He did not speak, but there was something in his manner she could\r\nnot resist.\r\n\r\n“That’s right,” the old man muttered as if he had not fully understood.\r\n“They are yours, little witch; he can’t take them; I have given them to\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nBill grasped them in silence, pressing the sharp stones into her flesh.\r\n\r\n“Now good-bye,” Harborough said more clearly, “good-bye, or shall\r\nwe say _au revoir_?” His breath failed him for a moment but he\r\nrecovered himself and went on cynically, “I have to go through with\r\nthis business, and being new to it I may bungle. In case I do not die\r\ndecently I would rather not disgrace myself in the presence of a lady.”\r\n\r\nSo Bill said good-bye and went out. Kit opened the door for her, and\r\nshutting it after her, left her standing alone outside. So she stood\r\na moment, like one in a dream, the diamonds still pressed into her\r\nflesh; then she turned and went with slow steps down the stairs, with\r\nquickening steps across the hall to the open door, and so out into the\r\ngarden where the afternoon shadows were long and the tender warmth of\r\nSeptember lay over everything. She followed the terraced path awhile,\r\nand then, her steps still quickening, crossed the lawn where the grass\r\nwas emerald green and the elm leaves lay scattered here and there. She\r\nwas almost running now, quite running when she came to the shrubbery,\r\nrunning at full speed, running blindly, wildly, faster and faster\r\nuntil she reached the wood and flung herself down in the waist-deep\r\nbracken and sobbed as if her heart would break.\r\n\r\nIt was much later when Kit found her, knowing perhaps where to look\r\nfor her. She had told him of her first ramble in the wood; at any rate\r\nwhen all was over, he found her under the yellowing beeches half hidden\r\namong the ferns. She started when she heard his step beside her, and\r\nat first was minded to pretend she had not been crying and practise\r\na belated self-control. But she did not, chiefly because he did not\r\npretend; he made no pretence of anything, nor yet behaved in the manner\r\nexpected of him and worthy of his breeding. He sat down beside her\r\nwithout speaking, whereupon she obstinately buried her face in the\r\nbracken and would not so much as look up though the stiff fern-stalks\r\npricked her neck. She moved her head uneasily and he gently broke a\r\nstalk away; in doing so his hand came in contact with her hair, a\r\nlittle curl of which, having become loosened, had contrived to get wet\r\nwith tears. The contact with it, and the recognition that it was wet\r\nwith tears, were things Kit did not soon forget; but he drew his hand\r\naway and only said stupidly: “Don’t cry, please don’t cry; I didn’t\r\nknow you cared about him like that.”\r\n\r\n“He was good to me”--Bill’s voice was muffled by the ferns--“but it\r\nisn’t exactly that.”\r\n\r\nHe had not been good to Kit, yet Kit felt vaguely grieved and shocked\r\nby his death; he looked in some perplexity at the girl beside him.\r\n“What is it then?” he asked, but she did not answer, so he fell back on\r\nhis first remark and entreated her not to cry any more.\r\n\r\n“I shall,” she answered without looking up. “I have not cried half\r\nenough yet,--there are so many things.--I haven’t nearly done.”\r\n\r\nKit glanced rather hopelessly at the half-buried figure. “Are you going\r\nto cry for them in order?” he asked attempting to smile.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nNevertheless Bill, with the sunny lights coming back to her eyes, sat\r\nup, rustling the dead leaves as she did so. “I wonder if the wood will\r\nbe cut down,” she said wistfully, as she glanced up at the interwoven\r\nbranches above her.\r\n\r\n“No,” Kit told her, “for neither you nor I would allow it.”\r\n\r\n“I?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; if it is not mine it will be yours, or as good as yours.”\r\n\r\n“Mine?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; if it is Theo’s--you said you were going to marry him--it will be\r\nyours too, and I am glad.”\r\n\r\n“Glad! I am not.”\r\n\r\nHer voice was passionate, almost vindictive, and Kit went on quickly:\r\n“I am glad, and you ought to be too. You said once that, were you in my\r\nplace, you would do anything to get Wood Hall; surely you ought not to\r\nmind if you have it.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not in your place,” Bill said, “and I don’t want it a bit. Do\r\nanything to get it! A woman can’t do anything but be married. I don’t\r\nwant Theo to have it, and I don’t want to come here.”\r\n\r\nShe buried her face in the ferns again, but now she did not cry. Kit\r\nbroke the stiff fern-stalk into little pieces, and as he threw them\r\naway caught sight of the buckles shining among the ferns near the\r\ngirl’s arm. Bill heard them clink as he picked them up, and sat up\r\nagain, facing him now with a calm determination. “I am not going to\r\nhave them,” she said quietly.\r\n\r\n“You must; you can’t help yourself. They were given to you, and you\r\nmust have them,” and he dropped them into her lap.\r\n\r\n“I am not going to have them,” she repeated; “had he known, he would\r\nnot have given them to me.”\r\n\r\n“No, because very probably they would have come to you in any case; I\r\ndon’t know how such things go, but it is likely they would have come to\r\nyou. At all events they are yours beyond dispute now.”\r\n\r\n“Mine, not my husband’s?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, yours absolutely.”\r\n\r\n“Mine to do with as I like?” The sense of ownership seemed to please\r\nthe girl. Kit wondered why a little, but he did not ask and her next\r\nwords explained. “Then I can give them to whom I please? I shall give\r\nthem to your wife on her wedding-day.”\r\n\r\nBill put the rejected buckles in her pocket, but Kit said quietly:\r\n“That you will never do, for I shall never marry.”"

      "title": "CHAPTER XXIV.",
      "content": "THE COURTSHIP OF HARBOROUGH OF BYBRIDGE.\r\n\nPolly said it was quite unnecessary for Bill to go to old Mr.\r\nHarborough’s funeral, though the wish to do so showed a nice feeling\r\non her part; and since she did wish it (and had a black dress) there\r\nreally was no reason why she should not go, more especially as she was\r\nleaving for London the next day and would thus escape Miss Minchin’s\r\ncross-questioning. But Gilchrist had other opinions; he strongly\r\ndisapproved of Bill’s going, seeing no reason for it and a great many\r\nagainst it. He himself had never claimed any connection with the\r\nHarboroughs during the old man’s life and did not intend to do so at\r\nhis death, except through the medium of the law. He said he should\r\nconsider it an impertinence on his own part to go to the funeral. Bill\r\nagreed with him as to the propriety of his staying away, but persisted\r\nin going herself. Gilchrist became really angry, and told her it was\r\nabsurd to go simply because Mr. Harborough had given her the diamond\r\nshoe-buckles; people who did not know the circumstances might put\r\nanother construction on her actions. Bill said she did not mind that,\r\nand also that the shoe-buckles were only part of her reason for going.\r\n\r\n“What other reason is there?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“I want to speak--” she began and then broke off. “Oh, I can’t tell\r\nyou,” she said impatiently. “I don’t mind your knowing if only I had\r\nnot the bother of explaining; as it is, I really can’t go into it. You\r\nsay so much about things, ask so many questions, see so many motives,\r\nand foresee so many consequences, that I really shall be obliged to\r\ngive up telling you. I don’t mind your knowing, and up till now I have\r\ntold you things; but I am afraid I shall have to begin taking you in to\r\nsave trouble.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know what you are saying?” was the beginning of Gilchrist’s not\r\nunnaturally severe answer: the end was less pacific. However, there was\r\nno quarrel between them, but he was exceedingly angry with her sayings\r\nthen, and even more so with her doings later on, for she went to the\r\nfuneral in spite of him. It was not easy to quarrel with Bill, as she\r\ndid not retaliate and did not mind; but also, as Polly knew, she could\r\nnot be moved, quietly taking her own course unless you could convince\r\nher it was wrong; “and Gilchrist can’t convince her,” Polly said after\r\nthe affair of the funeral. She herself advised Bill not to go when she\r\nfound how strong was Gilchrist’s opposition; but it did not make the\r\nslightest difference. Bill had promised Kit she would go, and she went.\r\n\r\nIt was soon after five on the afternoon when old Mr. Harborough died\r\nthat Kit found the girl in the wood; yet it was nearly nine when she\r\nreached Haylands. The intervening time was not entirely occupied in\r\nthe drive home, nor yet in the conversation concerning the reason for\r\nBill’s tears. Most of that conversation was carried on while she was\r\nhalf buried in the ferns; but there was another and a longer one when\r\nshe faced the facts of the case in the old library. Indeed, after a\r\nwhile her position and Kit’s were to a certain extent reversed; it was\r\nshe who comforted and planned, arraying the future in its best colours,\r\nhe who at first declined to see hope anywhere, even though he faced\r\nthat future with much apparent indifference.\r\n\r\nTruly, as Bill was forced to admit, the future did not look promising.\r\nBoth from what she had learned from Gilchrist--and she had made many\r\ninquiries of late--and from what Kit had heard from the solicitor and\r\nconfided to her now, she could not help seeing that the case looked bad\r\nagainst him. Even if a will existed--and Kit seemed to think that by no\r\nmeans likely--it would do little more than complicate the case without\r\ngiving him a title to the estates, unless he could make good his\r\nuncle’s title first. He told her all he knew about it, and she returned\r\nthe compliment; but they cannot be said to have advanced matters very\r\nmuch or come to any resolution. Of course, Kit was going to win the\r\nlawsuit,--that was a foregone conclusion--but Bill, whose universe was\r\nalways constructed with a convenient back door for use when foregone\r\nconclusions failed, strongly recommended him to consider how he would\r\nstand if the impossible were to happen. And it must be admitted that,\r\nif the catastrophe really took place, he would not stand very well,\r\nfor with Wood Hall and all it entailed gone there was not a great deal\r\nleft; briefly, a hundred a year inherited from his mother, a liberal\r\neducation and studious tastes which together had enabled him to take a\r\ngood classical degree at Oxford in the previous summer, and had further\r\nallowed him to study modern languages and literature with rather more\r\nthan usual thoroughness. These, besides youth and health, were the only\r\npassably serviceable possessions he could claim. There was a taste for\r\nwriting poetry and an aptitude for translating Greek verse, but neither\r\nwas any use; there were several other tastes which were no use, and yet\r\nothers which were positively detrimental.\r\n\r\n“I am afraid you would find it awfully hard,” Bill said once. She felt\r\na compassion which was almost motherly for him in his ignorance of the\r\nshifts and turns of the genteel poverty in which she had been reared.\r\n\r\n“No harder than other people,” he answered rather curtly.\r\n\r\nBill knew better. A hundred a year would have been wealth to her\r\nand Polly; sixty between Bella and Theresa seemed almost a fortune;\r\nhowever, she did not say so, but talked of small privations instead.\r\n\r\n“You would not be able to have a clean shirt every day,” she said, and\r\nKit winced at the mention of such sordid trifles. “Washing costs such\r\na lot,” the girl went on; “besides it wears things out. You would not\r\nbe able to have an evening paper if you had a morning one, and you\r\ncertainly would not be able to have many new books; you would have to\r\nhave your boots mended over and over again, and think what tips you\r\nwould give the porters. Saving in big things is not so hard; it is the\r\nlittle things you would hate, filing the edges,--you have to file the\r\nedges when you are making money or saving it either--it would set your\r\nteeth on edge horribly, I’m afraid.”\r\n\r\n“Not more than it does yours,” Kit retorted.\r\n\r\nBut Bill did not agree with him. “It does not hurt me,” she said; “I’m\r\nused to it and my people have been used to it; we have been poor long\r\nenough not to mind about these things. Besides, I love work; I don’t\r\ncare much what it is; I like to do things, and I don’t care what I do.\r\nI am afraid, too, I am not so very refined; things that would hurt you\r\ndon’t hurt me; I don’t believe I have got very ladylike tastes.”\r\n\r\nBut Kit turned on her here: in his opinion she was the most perfect\r\nlady living, not even she herself should question it in his hearing;\r\nand for a time the conversation became personal, but eventually it\r\nreturned to the original subject. Bill learned a good deal of Kit’s\r\nhistory that day,--of his mother, dead rather more than a year, but\r\nbeloved and tenderly revered, as indeed she deserved to be seeing\r\nthat he owed to her all the better part of himself,--of the quiet\r\nlife at Bybridge, the red Queen Anne house, with the walled garden,\r\nthe pleasant homecomings there to the widowed mother,--the student’s\r\ndays at Oxford, the travels in continental cities, tales of times and\r\nsights which fired Bill’s ready imagination and set her gipsy blood\r\naflame to be free to wander and to see and learn. In their interest in\r\nthese tales both listener and narrator almost forgot the graver matters\r\nbefore them. But there were other things, memories of still earlier\r\ndays which brought them back, the recollection of boyish days spent\r\nat Wood Hall, holidays when the parents were abroad and silently and\r\nunconsciously there grew in the young mind that love of the old place\r\nwhich is as an entail binding one generation to the next.\r\n\r\nBill listened greedily, forgetting all about home and Gilchrist who was\r\nwaiting for her there. At last, however, she did remember and somewhat\r\nhastily departed, feeling that in this talk of the past they had rather\r\nneglected considerations of the future. Before she went she promised\r\nshe would come to the funeral, partly to remedy the omission of that\r\nevening and partly to do honour to the old man who would not have many\r\nreal mourners.\r\n\r\nIn one respect, however, Bill made something of a mistake, for\r\nshe had that day without knowing it helped Kit Harborough for the\r\nfuture. Unconsciously she had preached to him the gospel which was so\r\ncompletely incorporated into her own nature that she did not even know\r\nshe believed it,--the gospel of work;--the delight and satisfaction in\r\nwork for its own sake irrespective of kind or place, just doing for\r\nthe sake of doing, and doing now, not waiting the time and opportunity\r\nfor a great work, but setting to at once on the nearest thing that\r\noffered. Not lamenting because the beautiful edifice of faith or hope\r\nhas tottered and fallen, but taking, instead, stones from the ruin to\r\nbuild a shelter while the plans for some greater work are maturing.\r\n\r\nBill did not think these things; she did not even know she believed\r\nthem; only she unconsciously translated them into action, and as\r\nunconsciously, by her words and by her attitude of mind, preached them\r\nto Kit.\r\n\r\nShe went to the funeral and stood respectfully on the outskirts of the\r\ngroup which gathered in the little churchyard in Wood Hall park. She\r\ndid not attach herself to the party, feeling herself an alien, but\r\nKit, who as recognised heir was chief mourner, saw her though he could\r\nnot come to her till a good deal later in the afternoon. She had said\r\nshe would wait for him among the beeches, and she did wait, for a\r\ntime almost forgetting him in the exquisite perfection of the silent\r\nOctober wood. When at last he came they finished the conversation begun\r\nthe other day, and they did not hurry over it unduly. Bill knew that\r\nGilchrist and the cousins would be angry with her late return, but so\r\nangry that half an hour one way or the other would make no difference.\r\n\r\nBefore the interrupted conversation was resumed Kit told her a piece\r\nof news which at first seemed of great importance to her, though\r\nafterwards she was obliged to agree with him in not attaching too much\r\nvalue to it. It appeared that old Mr. Harborough had made a will after\r\nall, and by the terms of it Kit would, were it not for the Australian,\r\nsucceed to the property exactly as he used to anticipate.\r\n\r\nBill clasped her hands with excitement. “Oh, I am so glad,” she said.\r\n\r\n“So am I, although I don’t think it will make much difference to the\r\ncase.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t?”\r\n\r\nHe shook his head but repeated that he was glad, and there was a few\r\nmoments’ silence before Bill said softly: “I am so glad you did not\r\nspeak about the will; it has happened without your speaking; you were\r\nright and I was wrong.”\r\n\r\nKit did not agree with her there, thinking they had been of one mind on\r\nthe subject of the will: but they did not discuss the point at length,\r\nturning instead to the consideration of Kit’s future, should the case\r\nbe decided against him.\r\n\r\nDoubtless if this really occurred his friends and relations would find\r\nor do something for him but he and Bill planned, curiously though\r\npractically, without considering the relations at all. Bill’s plans\r\nseldom depended on outside help, and usually, however absurd, had the\r\nmerit of being such that they could start working at once. She was\r\nrather anxious that Kit should start at once, for, as she said, if he\r\ncould earn anything the money would be no disadvantage should the case\r\ngo in his favour, and a decided advantage should it go against him.\r\nThe only difficulty was, to find anything he could do in his present\r\ncircumstances and with his modest talents.\r\n\r\n“You could teach,” Bill said doubtfully, having but a poor opinion\r\nof that refuge of the destitute; “with your degree you could get a\r\nmastership, but then I suppose your people would not like it; besides\r\nit would be rather awkward for other reasons. You might get some\r\ntranslating to do, as you know languages pretty well. I believe it is\r\nawfully hard to get, and not well paid; still it would be better than\r\nnothing, and if it is really so difficult to get, it would be just as\r\nwell to see after it before the need comes; you would be ready then\r\nif it did come. You said it might take as long as two years to settle\r\nabout Wood Hall? In two years you ought to be able to get a little\r\ntranslating, I should think.”\r\n\r\nKit thought so too, and they talked over ways and means, he telling\r\nher sundry youthful dreams, she listening with admiring sympathy\r\nnot untouched with practical common-sense. Eventually he did make a\r\nstart as she suggested, and finding, as they feared, that such work\r\nas he could do was almost impossible to obtain, he turned, till it\r\ncame, to one of the youthful dreams and translated some of the lesser\r\nknown dialogues of Lucian into scholarly English. And though even his\r\ninexperience could not but tell him that the work, when done, would\r\nnot be a marketable commodity, the doing of it was a great satisfaction\r\nto him. Later, through the good offices of a college friend, he got\r\na German book on botany to translate, and very uninteresting work he\r\nfound it. Nevertheless, because it was the first work he had ever been\r\npaid for, he was pleased with it, and so pleased with the small sum he\r\nreceived for it that he invested the whole in a large crystal of rough\r\namethyst, remembering how rapturous Bill had been in her admiration of\r\nthe small crystal he had shown her in the collection of such specimens\r\nat Wood Hall. When, however, it came to the point of sending his\r\ncrystal to the girl his courage failed; afraid of displeasing her he\r\nput the amethyst away, and no one knew of its existence for a long time.\r\n\r\nBut all this happened later and had no part in the conversation on\r\nthat October afternoon. It must be admitted, however, that if the\r\nconversation had entirely confined itself to plans for the future, Bill\r\nwould have reached home earlier than she did. Some chance reference\r\nto the shoe-buckles and the value Polly put upon them brought Peter\r\nHarborough to her mind, and with him the recollection of the gravestone\r\nat Sandover and its record of his tragic death. Who Peter Harborough\r\nwas, and how he died, were questions which perplexed her on the Sunday\r\nafternoon when she saw his grave; they returned to her with redoubled\r\ninterest now that his buckles had come into her possession; and she\r\nsought information of Kit.\r\n\r\nHe could tell her little more than that the man was the younger brother\r\nof old Mr. Harborough’s grandfather, and as such should have succeeded\r\nto the property if death had not intervened. “He was great friends\r\nwith the Corbys; it was at Corby Dean he was shot,” Kit concluded.\r\n\r\n“I know, but who shot him? Was it one of the Corbys, or did he do it\r\nhimself?”\r\n\r\n“No one knows, but his brother apparently was satisfied that it was all\r\nright; he asked no questions, took the property, and said nothing.”\r\n\r\nBill pondered the matter for a minute. “Which Corby was it?” she asked.\r\n“I mean with which one was he friendly and played cards? What relation\r\nwas he to Roger Corby, the old Squire?”\r\n\r\n“It was Roger Corby himself,” Kit told her; “Roger, the last of them.”\r\n\r\n“Roger Corby, himself,” Bill repeated. It was curious how she seemed to\r\nstumble upon fragments of this man’s history. She tried vainly to piece\r\nout his life, but she had so little to go on. At length she said: “But\r\nhe was not the last of them; he had a granddaughter who outlived him.”\r\n\r\n“She can hardly be counted.”\r\n\r\n“But why? I suppose she could have taken the property if there was any,\r\neven if she did marry and change her name.”\r\n\r\n“There was nothing to take; in fact the old squire was so much in\r\ndebt at his death that, although they sold all that was left of the\r\nproperty, it was little more than enough to pay everything off. Of\r\ncourse there was not much to sell then; there was little about here;\r\nCorby Dean, the house near Bybridge, was heavily mortgaged and nearly\r\ntumbling down, and most of the land near Sandover and Bybridge had\r\nalready been disposed of.”\r\n\r\n“You mean where Sandover now stands? It belongs to Mr. Briant now,\r\ndoesn’t it? By the way, you must have been staying with him at Bymouth,\r\nfor you were staying at the River House and that is where he lives.\r\nPolly found out; she always asks about the people who live in the big\r\nhouses.”\r\n\r\nKit said he had been staying with Mr. Briant and added: “It was the\r\ngrandfather of that man who first had the land from Roger Corby. It was\r\nnot worth much then, the present owner being the one who has developed\r\nit so tremendously; still even at that time it was a good lot for a man\r\nwith the old squire’s income to give to his steward.”\r\n\r\n“His steward? Was Mr. Briant’s grandfather Roger Corby’s steward?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; steward or bailiff or something of the sort; at least he was at\r\none time, but he left his service and went abroad, I think soon after\r\nPeter Harborough was shot.”\r\n\r\nBill considered the matter a moment. “And Roger gave him the land?” she\r\nasked at length.\r\n\r\n“Something very like it; he granted it to him absolutely, subject\r\nonly to some nominal rental payable if demanded, and that practically\r\namounts to a gift, at least to the first owner if not to his children.”\r\n\r\n“Roger Corby must have had some reason,” Bill said with conviction.\r\n\r\nKit agreed with her, though he could not say for certain what it may\r\nhave been. “Briant was steward at Corby Dean when Peter Harborough was\r\nshot,” he said; “that may have had something to do with it. But whether\r\nhe knew something about it and threatened to speak, or whether he did\r\nnot know and only threatened to make a charge which Roger Corby could\r\nnot disprove because of the secrecy of the affair I could never find\r\nout. Of course it is all very long ago now, and people do not seem to\r\ntake much interest in such things as a rule.”\r\n\r\nThis was said almost apologetically, as if the speaker were ashamed\r\nof his own interest; but he need not have apologised to Bill, who was\r\nherself more fascinated by these tales of the past than he was.\r\n\r\n“It was an awful lot to give,” she said at last, “but I suppose he had\r\nno choice. I wonder why he put in the nominal rental; has it ever been\r\ndemanded, do you know?”\r\n\r\n“I should not think so; there has been no one to demand it. I expect\r\nthat it was put in so that it might be possible for the Corbys\r\neventually to recover the land at the end of the time for which it was\r\ngranted. But it does not matter much now, for there are no more Corbys.”\r\n\r\n“But the granddaughter,” Bill asked, “what became of her? Did she not\r\nmarry and have children?”\r\n\r\n“She married but had no children; I don’t think anybody knows what\r\nbecame of her.”\r\n\r\n“Did she run away?” Bill thought it just possible, considering what was\r\ntold of her childhood, that this last of the Corbys might have run away\r\nif her fate demanded that solution of a difficulty.\r\n\r\n“Yes, that is it,” Kit said; “she ran away from her husband. I don’t\r\nknow the name of the man she went with, but they say she was never\r\nvery fond of her husband, and I should think she must have been rather\r\ndifficult to deal with; my uncle knew her, and he always spoke as if\r\nshe were. The man she married was younger than she, a clergyman--but\r\nyou know him, I expect you know all this; at least you must have heard\r\nsomething of Mr. Dane’s wife?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Dane!” Bill exclaimed, her eyes growing wide. “Was she his wife?\r\nHis wife--and he would have loved her so! Oh, Monseigneur, poor\r\nMonseigneur,” and her voice took the almost tender wail of a primitive\r\nwoman who mourns her loved ones.\r\n\r\n“Did you not know?” Kit asked, trying to remember if she had expressed\r\npity for his troubles in that tone.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. “I knew he had been married,” she said, “though\r\npeople at Ashelton usually speak as if he had not; perhaps they don’t\r\nknow. He never speaks about his wife, so I thought she must have died\r\nvery long ago.”\r\n\r\n“She did, or rather she left him long ago, forty years or more. I am\r\nsurprised you did not know, though now I come to think of it, people\r\nabout here hardly would; it did not happen here, and Mr. Dane did not\r\ncome to Ashelton till some time afterwards. Wilhelmina Corby had not\r\nlived here since she was quite a young girl, and there was nothing to\r\nconnect Mr. Dane with her in people’s minds.”\r\n\r\n“Was her name Wilhelmina? Then I wonder he puts up with me! I am\r\nWilhelmina; he ought to hate me. He ought to do that for several\r\nthings; I asked him something yesterday I would never have asked had I\r\nknown this.”\r\n\r\n“What was it? Will you tell me?”\r\n\r\nBill hesitated a moment before she said: “Yes, if you like. I asked him\r\nwhat he did when things went utterly wrong with his life, when”--the\r\ngirl’s tone had taken a passionate ring as if the occasion were not\r\nentirely impersonal--“when he felt like Job’s wife and wanted to curse\r\nGod and die because things were so hopelessly, incurably wrong.”\r\n\r\n“Why did you ask?”\r\n\r\nThe words were uttered almost before Kit knew what he said. When they\r\nwere once spoken, he would sooner have bitten his tongue through than\r\nthat they should have been said.\r\n\r\nShe sat silent for a long moment pulling the fern to pieces in her\r\nhands; when at last she did speak it was to repeat to him, with a\r\ncurious quietness, Mr. Dane’s words to herself.\r\n\r\n“He said,” so she told him, “on such a day as you speak of I shut\r\na door in my mind and went away without speaking or looking back;\r\nafterwards I played cricket at the school-treat, and I think I played\r\nas well as usual.”\r\n\r\nThat was all she said; after she had spoken there was a great silence\r\nin the yellow wood, except when the beech-nuts fell pattering on the\r\ndead leaves, and the robins, the year’s grandchildren, sang shrill and\r\nsweet in the branches.\r\n\r\nAt last she spoke again, scarcely above a whisper now: “I think I am\r\ngoing to try to do that.”\r\n\r\nKit turned and faced her; there was a faint flush on his cheek, but his\r\neyes met hers unflinchingly--“And I too,” he said; and then they walked\r\non in silence."

      "title": "CHAPTER XXV.",
      "content": "GENERAL SERVANT.\r\n\nIt is an old saying, and doubtless a good one, that two is company and\r\nthree none; yet the presence of a third person who stands somewhat\r\napart from the other two is frequently a great assistance to domestic\r\nhappiness and a great preventive of domestic friction. Polly took Bill\r\nto London during the first week in October and Theresa missed her at\r\nevery turn. There was no one to play bézique with Robert in the long\r\ndull evenings; Theresa hated cards, and though she tried to play from a\r\nsense of duty her skill was so small that her efforts were a failure.\r\nThere was no one to talk and amuse him when he came in at odd times;\r\nTheresa was somewhat silent by nature, and she did not seem to have\r\ngrasped the details of his work. She could not remember the points\r\nof his horses or the names of his dogs; it all came natural to Bill\r\nwho, Theresa reflected, had less on her mind and so of course might be\r\nexpected to remember better. She missed the girl herself, too, in the\r\ndairy and store-room, in the house and orchard and garden. She missed\r\nher when the late apples fell, and when the dead leaves gathered thick\r\nin the garden; she missed the all-pervading sunshine of her nature,\r\nand she missed the regular visits Gilchrist Harborough used to pay on\r\nBill’s account.\r\n\r\nOf course she had nothing but the most impersonal interest in\r\nGilchrist,--no one, not even Polly had suggested otherwise, though\r\nTheresa flushed as she remembered what Polly had suggested--still it\r\nwas pleasanter when he used to come. If Bill had been here he would\r\nhave come to-night; it was one of his evenings. Robert had gone to a\r\npolitical meeting at Wrugglesby and would not be home till late, and\r\nTheresa sighed a little, to think of the weary number of hours before\r\nher. She wondered a little, over her sewing, if Gilchrist had gone too.\r\n\r\nBut Gilchrist had not gone to the political meeting; he did not even\r\nknow Robert had gone, for he came to Haylands that evening to speak\r\nto him, and finding he was not at home, came in to leave a message\r\nwith Theresa. She was sincerely glad to see him, and he, to judge from\r\nhis manner, was sincerely glad to be there again. To tell the truth\r\nhe too missed those pleasant evenings at Haylands, the refinement and\r\nindescribable femininity of the house appealing to him in a way that\r\nsurprised even himself.\r\n\r\n“One needs a woman about a place,” he reflected that evening when he\r\nwent once more to the house and found that though Bill was gone, the\r\nfemininity remained,--flowers, needlework, delicate womanly atmosphere,\r\nall as before, all as attractive. It must be admitted that he did\r\nnot expect otherwise, for to him Bill did not suggest such things;\r\nshe could arrange flowers as well as grow them, and she often sat at\r\nneedlework when he saw her, sewing very strongly, very intently; yet to\r\nhim there was something unfeminine in the very energy with which she\r\ndid the smallest things. Theresa,--he did not think much about Theresa,\r\nexcept to decide that it was an advantage to be sure what a woman\r\nmeant, and sometimes what she thought, advantages he did not feel he\r\npossessed with regard to Bill.\r\n\r\nShe, it is true, had been surprisingly docile of late, but her docility\r\nwas flat and uninteresting, and there was besides an uneasy feeling\r\nin Gilchrist’s mind that he did not know what lay behind. He did not\r\nfeel that he had grasped Bill at all. He had been exceedingly angry\r\non the occasion of Mr. Harborough’s funeral, and there had followed\r\nan interview with Bill which should have been stormy. It was not,\r\nhowever; Bill was truly sorry for having annoyed him so much, confessed\r\nher sins, and promised more respect for his wishes in future. She was\r\nhonestly trying to do her duty now, and to behave in the way she ought.\r\nGilchrist did not altogether believe in her repentance, which was\r\nperhaps not unnatural; and when she confessed herself wrong, he agreed\r\nwith her and accepted her self-accusations as a matter of course. It is\r\nsometimes a pity to accept another’s self-accusations so readily; just\r\nit may be, but it is not always encouraging. Fortunately it mattered\r\nless to Bill than to most people and peace was patched up between\r\nthem, though things were not perhaps in the most satisfactory state\r\nwhen she left for London. Had the engagement not rested on something\r\nmore reliable than mutual affection it would hardly have been wise of\r\nPolly to take the girl to London, for in spite of her faults, she had a\r\nspecies of fascination for Gilchrist when she was present, and when she\r\nwas absent there was Theresa to consider.\r\n\r\nHowever, about that time Gilchrist did not give much attention to\r\neither Theresa or Bill, for the opening of the Harborough lawsuit\r\noccupied most of his thoughts. It also occupied the thoughts of his\r\nneighbours, and was looked upon as a matter of tremendous local\r\ninterest; Ashelton even split into factions over the question of the\r\njustice or injustice of the claim, of which, by the way, very little\r\nwas generally known. Mr. Stevens was much pressed for information, or\r\nat least for his opinion as to the probable issue, but though he had\r\nno professional connection with either party he maintained a discreet\r\nsilence. He once went so far as to say that a lot of good money would\r\nbe wasted by two young men who could ill afford it, and that without\r\nknowing a great deal more than he now knew he should be sorry to bet on\r\neither. This discreet opinion was more moderate than those held by most\r\nof his neighbours.\r\n\r\nTheresa knew little more than the rest of the village on the great\r\nsubject of the Harborough claim, for Gilchrist had not had time to\r\nexplain it to her since the case opened, and before that time he had\r\nthought it wiser to keep silence even with members of Bill’s family.\r\n\r\n“Not that I minded you knowing,” he said to Theresa the night Robert\r\nwent to the political meeting. “I had not the least objection to that,\r\nonly I was afraid if Bill told you she would also tell Miss Hains, and\r\nshe, you know, is perhaps not quite so discreet. I am sure she would\r\nnot mean to betray a confidence, but she talks a good deal, and people\r\nwho do that often say more than they intend.”\r\n\r\nIn this he scarcely did Polly justice, for though she might betray a\r\nsecret it was not by accident or through foolishness. But Theresa said\r\nshe understood, and led him to talk of his chances of success. He was\r\nvery cautious and would not commit himself at all, but she persisted in\r\nspeaking as if a favourable issue were certain.\r\n\r\n“Fancy little Bill mistress of such a place as Wood Hall!” she said,\r\nwhen at last she had in her own mind brought all to a satisfactory\r\nconclusion. She was evidently delighted with the idea, but this\r\nparticular side of the termination was exactly what Gilchrist did not\r\nfancy; however, he only replied to Theresa by saying with a smile:\r\n“Things have not quite reached that point yet, and I almost doubt if\r\nBill expects them to do so; she hardly seems to quite realise what the\r\nposition would be if they did.”\r\n\r\n“I expect not. She little thought when once or twice she went to see\r\nold Mr. Harborough that she herself might one day live at Wood Hall. It\r\nwill take her a long time to get used to the idea; she is such a child.”\r\n\r\nThat was not her worst complaint in Gilchrist’s eyes, but he only said,\r\n“Time will cure that.”\r\n\r\nIt was just then that there came the sound of a stumble in the passage.\r\nTheresa started from her chair. “I did not hear Robert’s horse,” she\r\nexclaimed. “I--you--I’m afraid--”\r\n\r\nGilchrist had heard that heavy stumble, that muttered oath before; he\r\nhad reached the door as soon as she and put out his hand to open it\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n“I am afraid Robert is not well;” she faced him unflinchingly with the\r\nlie. “Will you excuse me? I must go to him--good-night;” and she passed\r\nout leaving him alone.\r\n\r\nBill had been right; she had found him out, and she stood between him\r\nand all the world, hiding his fall with her pitiful little pretence.\r\nAnd he--Gilchrist ground his teeth in impotent rage as he walked home\r\nthrough the darkness that night--what was he to receive such loyalty,\r\nsuch service!\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps fortunate for Gilchrist Harborough that he had a good\r\ndeal to think of just now; the lawsuit absorbed a large proportion\r\nof his time and interests, and it was just as well that it did, for,\r\nalthough it prevented him from paying much attention to Bill, it also\r\nprevented him from paying much to other subjects which were better\r\nlet alone. After the evening when he saw Theresa he devoted himself\r\nmore assiduously than ever to the matter of the suit, and so really\r\nabsorbing did he find it that, though he was in town pretty often that\r\nautumn, he was not once able to spare an hour to go to Bayswater to see\r\nBill. However, about the beginning of December he fancied he should be\r\nable to manage it, and wrote to tell her that he hoped to come.\r\n\r\nBill and Polly had been well established now for some time, for they\r\ndid not take long settling down, though the process had not been all\r\nthat Polly had anticipated. If the truth must be known, her position\r\nnow was not altogether unlike that of the old magician who, having\r\nraised a spirit to help him in his schemes, finds the obliging goblin\r\nto be of such unexpected magnitude that it proves not only embarrassing\r\nbut likely to constitute itself master instead of servant. Polly’s\r\nspirit, very obliging, very hard-working and even-tempered, presented\r\none serious drawback,--it would rule. It was useless for Polly to\r\nattempt any of the little shifts dear to her heart; Bill, who knew\r\nher, was equal to them all, and forestalled her in the pleasantest\r\nbut completest way possible. Once or twice at the beginning of the\r\npartnership Polly threatened to turn her all too active partner out,\r\nbut she never did it. Probably she never seriously thought of it, for\r\nBill was very useful; there was no need to employ a girl with Bill in\r\nthe house, no need to have either a boot-boy or a charwoman; no need\r\nfor Polly herself to do more than a very moderate share of the work.\r\nBill also got on well with the lodgers and with the tradespeople, and,\r\nwhen once they two had got to understand their relative positions,\r\nexcellently well with Polly herself.\r\n\r\nBill had altered in several ways besides in this development of the\r\nruling spirit. Polly found her quieter than she used to be, on the\r\nwhole more a woman and less a child, though she occasionally lapsed\r\ninto her old ways. She had shut a door in her mind, and was trying\r\nhard to do well the thing which came next. It was easy enough when it\r\nwas housework or cooking; she did them to the best of her ability, too\r\nwell, in fact, according to Polly, who was no advocate for superfluous\r\nthoroughness. But there were other things she tried to do which were\r\nnot easy; she was trying under somewhat adverse circumstances to be\r\nmore of a lady, more like Theresa to please Gilchrist, more like the\r\ngentlewoman of Mr. Dane’s definition to please herself.\r\n\r\nOn the whole the cousins lived happily and let their rooms with a fair\r\namount of success. Polly’s lot was occasionally brightened by a hamper\r\nfrom Haylands, or shaded by the loss of a paying lodger or the all too\r\nprevious departure of one who had not paid. But in the beginning of\r\nDecember when Gilchrist came to town things were not very prosperous;\r\nthe rooms had been empty some time, the cold weather had set in early,\r\nand the fog, which preceded and sometimes accompanied the frost, was\r\nboth depressing and likely to be expensive in gas. Polly economised in\r\ncandle-ends, bemoaning her fate, and then indulged in buttered muffins\r\n“to cheer us up.” It was on the occasion of the muffins that Bill\r\nreceived Gilchrist’s letter.\r\n\r\n“I wonder if he is going home again the same night,” Polly speculated.\r\n“He had much better stay here,--there is plenty of room. I shall ask\r\nhim; it will be more correct for me to do it than for you.”\r\n\r\nBill did not know why it was more correct, but knowing Polly liked\r\nthese small details she raised no objection, and in due time the\r\ninvitation was given and accepted. Polly was much pleased, being\r\ngenuinely hospitable and moreover very proud of her dingy little house;\r\nshe also thought a great deal of Gilchrist since the matter of Wood\r\nHall had come to her knowledge, and she prepared for his reception\r\naccordingly. The best bedroom was made ready, the best sitting-room\r\nset in order. Bill did most of that, but Polly, with an eye to effect,\r\nbrought their work-baskets and books from the kitchen, where they were\r\nusually kept.\r\n\r\n“We must make it look as if we sat here always,” she said, as she put a\r\nreel of cotton on the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\n“Then we must bring the cat,” Bill replied, “for he always sits with\r\nus. But it is rather nonsense; why should not Gilchrist know we live\r\nin the kitchen? He knows that somebody must do the work, and he won’t\r\nthink the worse of us for doing it.”\r\n\r\nBut Polly thought otherwise. “It was different when he was only a\r\nworking farmer,” she said. “Now, since all this about Wood Hall has\r\nhappened, he won’t look at it in quite the same way.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see any reason for pretending, when he knows that we work.”\r\n\r\n“He knows it in a general way, but it is one thing to know it and quite\r\nanother to see it being done.”\r\n\r\nWith which incontestable opinion Polly closed her remarks and carried\r\nher point, and when Gilchrist came soon after six o’clock the best\r\nsitting-room looked as snug as though it were the family’s habitual\r\nliving-room. Bill had on her best frock and her best manners, and\r\neverything was as pleasant as possible. Polly was delighted; she had\r\nbeen a little afraid that Gilchrist, in his position of claimant to\r\nthe Wood Hall estate, might wish to make a more advantageous marriage\r\nthan the one in prospect. She was very much afraid that he might\r\nuse the private and not very binding nature of the engagement as an\r\nexcuse to repudiate it, or to induce Bill to release him. But on that\r\nDecember evening she was perfectly satisfied, he and Bill evidently\r\nunderstanding one another, and Bill was behaving beautifully; she was\r\nso gentle and submissive, she might almost have been anybody.\r\n\r\nPolly, in spite of her low financial ebb, had prepared what she called\r\na “tasty supper” in honour of the guest. It was not altogether unlike\r\nher millinery--an ingenious “do-up” finished off with a few new\r\ntrimmings, but it was undeniably successful. She was very gratified\r\nby its success and by things in general, and it was with a cheerful\r\ncountenance that she withdrew after the meal.\r\n\r\n“I know you must have a lot to talk about,” she said, beaming upon the\r\nother two; “and as I have some letters to write, I think I will go and\r\ndo them down-stairs.”\r\n\r\nSo she went, though the letters resolved themselves into the\r\nsupper-things which she washed, while up-stairs Gilchrist told Bill\r\nall about Wood Hall and the progress of the case, which was not rapid,\r\nand his opinion of the rival claimant, which was not enthusiastic. Bill\r\nlistened and answered as sympathetically as she could, though it is\r\npossible she would rather have been washing dishes in the kitchen.\r\nStill she did her share in the conversation admirably, and when they\r\nspoke of things other than those concerning Wood Hall she was really\r\nsplendid in her efforts to be like Theresa. Nevertheless Gilchrist did\r\nnot commend her improvement; perhaps he was not satisfied with it, nor\r\nwith the submissive girl, who was trying so hard to please him.\r\n\r\nBill felt the failure when she went to bed that night. “I expect it did\r\nnot ring true,” she thought; “I must try to feel like Theresa as well\r\nas behave like her. I’ll do it in time; I believe I could be anything\r\nif I tried long enough.” And so she fell asleep, resolutely trying to\r\nschool herself to what she conceived to be Theresa’s attitude of mind.\r\nShe woke next morning with the same thought uppermost and continued her\r\npractice of what she called “Theresaing” her mind while she cleaned the\r\nguest’s boots in the basement.\r\n\r\nAt breakfast that morning Gilchrist said he should not leave for\r\nWrugglesby until the six o’clock train. Bill felt a pleasurable\r\nexpectancy; perhaps he would suggest that they two should go for a walk\r\nsomewhere; she knew where they would go, the British Museum was free to\r\nall comers and they would go there and look at all the mummies. There\r\nwas so little work to do now, Polly would not mind, and it would be\r\nvery nice.\r\n\r\nGilchrist said he had business which would occupy him during the\r\nmorning. That was natural, but the afternoon--Polly supposed, with\r\nan affable smile, that he “would want her to spare Bill part of the\r\nafternoon.” But Gilchrist, looking out of the window, said it did not\r\npromise to be a very nice day, adding that he probably would not be\r\nback before four, when it would be quite dark.\r\n\r\n“Just as if it is not possible to go out after dark and enjoy it too!”\r\nPolly observed indignantly later on in the day. The cousins were\r\nclearing up after their mid-day dinner and Polly slammed the plates\r\ninto the rack in a dangerous manner as she spoke, her disgust with\r\nGilchrist having been simmering all the morning.\r\n\r\nBut Bill hardly glanced round. “I don’t care,” she said indifferently;\r\n“I did not want to go so very much.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I dare say!” Polly snorted indignantly. “He ought to have taken\r\nyou all the same; I don’t think it is at all nice behaviour on his\r\npart. He has not brought you a present or anything, in spite of all his\r\nfuss about Wood Hall.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want presents. He is no richer than he was, and he has no time\r\nto think of it, and--and--I don’t want things.”\r\n\r\nBill’s face was rosy and her tone hurt, but Polly went on volubly:\r\n“Look at Jack Dawson; besides a lovely engagement-ring (which you have\r\nnot got through Theresa’s nonsense) he has given Bella--”\r\n\r\n“I tell you, Polly, I don’t want presents; I won’t have you say any\r\nmore about it!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, well, of course I can quite understand you don’t like to have it\r\nmentioned, but I must say I don’t think it is at all nice of him. You\r\nhaven’t cost him much, in fact nothing at all; I suppose he thought,\r\nas he could have you for the asking, he need not trouble, but it isn’t\r\nvery flattering. I do think he might have taken you out--might have\r\ntaken us both out--after all the trouble we have had too, that lovely\r\nsupper last night, and fried bacon for breakfast this morning, and all.”\r\n\r\nBill laughed. “A truly commercial mind!” she said. “But perhaps\r\nGilchrist will leave a tip for our invisible servant; if so, you could\r\ntake that in payment for the supper.”\r\n\r\nBut Polly was much annoyed with the guest, more than was just, for he\r\nwas really too busy to think of anything at present, and he certainly\r\nhad not intended to slight or wound either of the cousins. Nevertheless\r\nhe had wounded Polly’s pride; as for Bill, no one knew what she\r\nthought, for which reason, if for no other, Polly reflected that she\r\nhad done very foolishly to speak as she had done. She was herself\r\ndressing to go out now because she “felt so upset that she could not\r\nstay in.” While she dressed she came to the conclusion that she had\r\nbeen most indiscreet, for if it were true that Gilchrist had been\r\nneglectful it was her place to pour balm on Bill’s wounds, not to point\r\nout Gilchrist’s misdemeanours. She had certainly been foolish, and\r\naccordingly, before going out, she went to the kitchen and apologised\r\nfor what she had said.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t mean anything,” she explained. “I was annoyed by that butcher\r\nsending in his bill as he did, and I was put out and cross altogether.\r\nOf course I would not say a word against Gilchrist. You know what a lot\r\nI think of him; he’s worth twenty of Jack Dawson; nobody would expect\r\nhim to waste his money on silly presents.”\r\n\r\nBill said it was “all right,” and Polly went out leaving her young\r\ncousin cleaning the kitchen-hearth. And possibly it would have been all\r\nright but for what followed. Bill had not thought of receiving presents\r\nfrom Gilchrist, nor yet of going out with him; she did not expect\r\neither, and though she was disappointed about the mummies, she did not\r\nregard his actions as an index of his affections.\r\n\r\nIt was when she had almost finished the hearth that there came a ring\r\nat the front door. It was not much after three yet, and Polly had said\r\nshe would be home at half-past so as to be ready by the time Gilchrist\r\nreturned at four. Bill came to the conclusion that it must be the\r\nbaker who rang, and since the summons sounded peremptory, she went\r\nup-stairs without waiting to take off the sacking apron she had put\r\non for cleaning the hearth. She wore her oldest frock, which she had\r\nput on as soon as their visitor went out; it was short as well as old,\r\nand her disreputable shoes showed well below it. It was not wonderful\r\nthat Gilchrist looked at her blankly for a moment when she opened the\r\ndoor to him and his friend Ferguson. Only for a moment he looked, and\r\nthen Bill, withdrawing herself behind the door after the manner of\r\nmaids-of-all-work, spoke: “Miss ’Ains is out,” she said; “but walk in,\r\nwon’t yer, sir?”\r\n\r\nGilchrist walked in, half paused, and then went on without speaking.\r\nIt was impossible to present her to Ferguson as his future wife, more\r\nespecially impossible in the light of her stupidly unrecognising look;\r\nshe herself made the introduction impossible by the very perfection\r\nwith which she had assumed her part. So the introduction was not made,\r\nand the two men went up to the sitting-room to examine a document\r\nGilchrist had left there, while Bill, with a clatter of ill-shod feet,\r\nwent back to the kitchen.\r\n\r\nBy-and-bye the street door was closed, and soon after, the work being\r\ndone, Bill went up-stairs to change her dress. She thought Gilchrist\r\nhad gone out with his friend, but she was mistaken. As she passed the\r\nhalf-open door of the sitting-room she saw him standing before the\r\nfireplace, where, for economy’s sake, the fire had been allowed to go\r\nout after he had left that morning. Bill paused: Polly had told her to\r\nre-light the fire before half-past three. It must be done; moreover,\r\nshe in her own character never hesitated about going through with any\r\ndifficulty into which she might have blundered; in the character of\r\nTheresa it was impossible to know how to act, for Theresa never got\r\ninto these difficulties. Consequently the character of Theresa was\r\nforgotten, and it was the original Bill who walked into the room with\r\ngenuine regret for what had occurred, but not entirely without a little\r\namusement too.\r\n\r\n“I’ll light the fire,” she said, turning back the hearth-rug before\r\nshe knelt down and beginning to arrange paper in the grate. “I am very\r\nsorry, Gilchrist,” she went on penitently as she glanced up at the\r\nyoung man’s gloomy face. “I never expected you back so early; I thought\r\nit was the baker.”\r\n\r\n“Are you in the habit of going to the baker like that?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, sometimes, if I am in a hurry or he is. I thought the ring\r\nsounded like a hurry. I really am sorry, but Mr. Ferguson didn’t know\r\nme, so there’s not much harm done.”\r\n\r\n“I think there is a great deal of harm done.” Gilchrist’s face did not\r\nrelax. “Don’t trouble about the fire just now, I want to talk to you.\r\nTell me, is it necessary for you to get in this condition?”\r\n\r\nBill obediently left laying the fire and answered apologetically: “I am\r\nafraid I am a dirty worker.”\r\n\r\n“But surely it is hardly necessary to do this work. What have you been\r\ndoing? What do you do?”\r\n\r\n“I was cleaning the kitchen-stove when you rang,” Bill answered meekly,\r\nthough something in the masterfulness of his tone was rousing the old\r\nBill whom it was not easy to drive. “Perhaps,” she went on with a spark\r\nof fun in her eyes, “it was hardly necessary to do the stove, but I\r\ndon’t know; it is a point open to discussion; the same with the knives\r\nwhich I have cleaned since; but your boots, which I did earlier in the\r\nday, really were necessary, don’t you think so?”\r\n\r\n“Did you clean my boots?”\r\n\r\n“I cleaned your honour’s noble boots,” and she swept him a courtesy and\r\nthen looked up with a dawning smile.\r\n\r\nBut he did not smile. “You ought not to have done it,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Why? I did not mind.”\r\n\r\n“I mind.”\r\n\r\nYet his tone somehow told her that he minded because she was his future\r\nwife and the possible mistress of Wood Hall, rather than because she\r\nwas herself.\r\n\r\n“I told you I should be a general servant,” she said. “Do you remember\r\nthat night we went to the Dawsons and Miss Dawson was so contemptuous?”\r\nand she set her mobile face into Miss Dawson’s supercilious stare. But\r\nGilchrist did not seem pleased by the recollection, and the imp in Bill\r\ngetting the upper hand, she went on somewhat recklessly. “Well, I am\r\na general servant now, though not a very good one. What a queer little\r\nslavey you’ve got here, Harborough,” and her change of tone made the\r\nman start, and for a moment almost think Ferguson was back. “Who the\r\ndevil is she? I believe I know her face--by Jove, she’s like the plum\r\ngirl I met near your place last summer. But I don’t think Gilchrist\r\ntold her name.”\r\n\r\n“No”--his tone was cold with suppressed anger--“I did not tell your\r\nname; I was not exactly proud of my future wife.”\r\n\r\nThe smile died out of her face. “I am very sorry,” she said penitently,\r\nand the penitence was genuine, but Gilchrist was not mollified.\r\n\r\n“You do not show it,” he said; “mimicking my friends and making fun\r\nof what you have done hardly suggests regret. I think under the\r\ncircumstances it would be as well if we said no more about it. Perhaps\r\nyou had better go and change your dress; talking will not make matters\r\nany better.”\r\n\r\nShe began to move towards the door humbled by his words, but half\r\nturned before she opened it. “Are matters very bad?” she asked\r\nwistfully.\r\n\r\n“Can you think them very good? Do you think your life, or ways, or,--or\r\nanything at all fitting to the position you may have to occupy? I don’t\r\nmean to blame you, but things do not promise to be quite the same as\r\nthey were, and I wish you would try to remember the difference.”\r\n\r\nShe turned fully now, and unconsciously both tone and manner had\r\nchanged, becoming quiet and firm. “You mean,” she said, “that what was\r\nfitting for your wife when you were only Harborough of Crows’ Farm is\r\nnot fitting now? You are quite right; I agree with you.”\r\n\r\n“Then I wish you would act upon it.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot, the unfitness goes too deep, for it is I myself who was fit\r\nto be your wife then but am not now.”\r\n\r\n“Bill! What nonsense is this? I am no different from what I was: the\r\ncase is not decided, may never be decided in my favour; and if it were\r\nit would make no difference. I have never suggested such a thing and I\r\nnever meant it.”\r\n\r\n“You did not say it, but I do; it is true. Listen a minute--I have\r\ntried to be ladylike, as I thought you would wish me to be, and\r\nsometimes I think I succeed a little,--this afternoon doesn’t count, it\r\nwas an accident--but my ladylikeness, even if it were more successful,\r\nis not what is wanted. It is I, my real self, who am unfit to be your\r\nwife under the present circumstances.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what right you have to say such a thing; I suppose you\r\nare angry because of what I said this afternoon.” If she were angry the\r\nyoung man could not help thinking she had a strange way of showing it,\r\nfor her whole manner suggested clear-sighted calmness; the excitement\r\nwas his. “I own I spoke sharply,” he went on, “and I am sorry for it,\r\nbut I was annoyed.”\r\n\r\n“You had a right to be,” she told him; “I deserved it and I am not\r\nangry at all. It is not what you said just now that makes me say this,\r\nit is the whole thing; I cannot help seeing I am not fit for you now.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you are; the position has not altered, and if it did you are as\r\nfit for the new as the old if you choose to be.”\r\n\r\nBut the girl shook her head. “No,” she said, “I am not. I was fit for\r\nCrows’ Farm; that life would have drawn out a good side of me, just as\r\nit drew out a side of you which wanted me. Wood Hall acts differently.\r\nOh, I know you have not got it yet, may never have it; but the fact\r\nthat you have claimed it, that you have a close acknowledged connection\r\nwith the other Harboroughs has altered your position, has altered you\r\nand your ideas. No matter what happens now you cannot be only the\r\nworking farmer of Crows’ Farm who wants a working wife.”\r\n\r\n“You mean to say you believe I don’t think you good enough?”\r\n\r\n“No, oh no; it is not that exactly; I think it is that we don’t fit\r\nnow.”\r\n\r\n“Do you want to fit?” Gilchrist eyed her sternly as he asked the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n“I did want to,” she told him. “I tried hard to be what you would like\r\nwhile I thought you wanted to marry me--”\r\n\r\n“You think I don’t want to marry you now?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she answered simply, and her school companions Carrie and Alice\r\nwould have told her that she had not yet acquired a sense of decency,\r\nfor she certainly did not know how to mince matters. “You did want\r\nto marry me,” she said, “and I would have married you; but the new\r\nposition makes you and your wants different and would make me different\r\ntoo. The whole thing had better end.”\r\n\r\n“In plain terms, you won’t marry me now?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I will,” she said meeting his eyes bravely. “I will marry you if\r\nyou can truthfully say you still wish it.”\r\n\r\nHe hesitated a moment. “Of course I do,” he answered.\r\n\r\nBut that was not what Bill meant and she said so.\r\n\r\n“You don’t believe me?” he said rather stiffly. “You must please\r\nyourself about that, but if you wish to be free of course you can be;\r\nour engagement was on those terms; you are not bound.”\r\n\r\n“I am bound by my own word,” she answered; “so long as you want me I am\r\nbound. But you don’t really want me. Look at me; am I suited to be your\r\nwife? Tell me--you know me now--do you wish it?”\r\n\r\nShe stood at the end of the room, the murky light of the winter dusk\r\nfalling upon her, intensifying not concealing the faults in her dress,\r\nher shoes, her sacking apron. A small, odd, shabby figure she looked\r\nin that cheerless little parlour with its empty grate, small and odd,\r\nnot alluring at all in the gloom. The man saw each detail, and seeing,\r\nwondered how she had ever bewitched him.\r\n\r\nHe could not but look at her, and as he looked he moved slightly. “You\r\nare talking nonsense,” he said, turning to the empty grate; “to-morrow\r\nyou will think better of all this.”\r\n\r\nHe glanced at her as he ceased speaking, but it was too late. He should\r\nhave met her eyes before if he wished to convince her.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” she said simply; “now you have told me.”\r\n\r\n“I--told you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; you need not mind, you did it quite honourably. Don’t mind. See\r\nhere, I will square it with Polly and Theresa; it will be better so;\r\nthey will only think I have changed my mind. Theresa will be sorry and\r\nPolly angry, but they won’t say anything to you; they won’t know about\r\nyou: they will think it is all me.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to tell me you consider our engagement at an end and you\r\nwill tell your cousins so?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“You shall do no such thing!”\r\n\r\n“I shall tell Polly to-day; she is not in yet, but she will be soon. I\r\nshall tell her as soon as she comes.”\r\n\r\n“Then you do it against my will.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,”--Bill spoke doubtfully--“telling is against the grain I dare\r\nsay, but the breaking off is not. It is no good, Theo; don’t let us\r\npretend any more. I know you would have honourably gone through with it\r\nbecause you gave your word, and I would have honourably done the same\r\nbecause I gave mine and believed you wished it; and we should have both\r\ndone what we could to make the best of it afterwards. But all through\r\nme getting so grubby this afternoon I have found out the truth, and you\r\nare freed from your word, and it is all over; so let us say so, and be\r\nfriends.”\r\n\r\nFive minutes later Polly found the street door ajar and entered the\r\nhouse mentally abusing Bill’s carelessness. She went up-stairs and\r\nseeing the sitting-room door open, she looked into the room. Neither\r\nfire nor gas was lighted; in the cold twilight she saw the small figure\r\nby the window.\r\n\r\n“Bill,” she exclaimed, “not dressed yet! And the fire not laid, nothing\r\ndone and Gilchrist will be here directly. This is nice!”\r\n\r\n“Gilchrist is not coming; he has gone away altogether.”\r\n\r\n“Not coming! Not coming back, do you mean? And I have bought two lovely\r\ntea-cakes and half-a-pound of fresh butter!”"

      "content": "AN OLD WOUND.\r\n\n“Do come here for Christmas,” wrote Bella to Bill from Haylands about\r\nthe middle of December. “You must come, if it is only for a week. It is\r\nnonsense for Polly to say she can’t spare you; she simply must. Theresa\r\nthinks that it will do you good. She won’t believe what Polly says\r\nabout the way in which you have taken this breaking off with Gilchrist;\r\nshe thinks you must be upset, and that to come here might do you good.\r\nI enclose a postal order for six shillings for the fare. Polly is sure\r\nto say you can’t afford it; Theresa and I can, and we want you to come.”\r\n\r\nAnd in spite of Polly’s protestations and objections Bill went. Polly\r\ncould not go; she had one lodger now and could not shut the house up.\r\nBut seeing that he was only one, and one who did not require much\r\nwaiting on, and seeing also that Bella and Theresa had paid Bill’s\r\nfare, there was no reason why she should not go. So Bill went to\r\nWrugglesby, and Bella and Theresa, who had driven from Ashelton for\r\nsome shopping, met her and brought her home.\r\n\r\nBella was glad Bill was coming, although, she reflected, if the girl\r\nwas really as disturbed as Theresa imagined about her broken engagement\r\nshe would be but poor company and not much relief from the dulness of\r\nHaylands. For some reason or other it had been dull there that autumn,\r\nat least on the days when Jack did not come. Theresa, who had always\r\nbeen quiet, was more quiet than ever now; she seemed to have aged\r\nduring the past months, or else Bella, used to associating with the\r\nlivelier if more unprincipled Polly, thought so. “Marriage does alter\r\npeople,” thought Bella, and fell to speculating about herself and Jack.\r\nThere really was very little to think about at Haylands, very little\r\nto talk about in all Ashelton. Even Miss Minchin, at the fortnightly\r\nworking-parties, had nothing fresh to say, and so went untiringly over\r\nthe nine days’ wonder of Gilchrist Harborough’s claim to Wood Hall.\r\n\r\nMiss Minchin might not be tired of that, but Bella was, and by the\r\nbeginning of December she had heard quite enough of that and most\r\nother subjects of Ashelton conversation. But about that time she\r\nand Theresa found a fresh subject in the letter Bill wrote to them\r\nafter Gilchrist’s visit to London. She wrote by one post, and by the\r\nnext Polly wrote a good two ounces of lamentation, indignation, and\r\nabuse, the last both of Theresa and her “ridiculous secrecy,” and\r\nalso, in a far larger degree, of Bill and her obstinacy. Theresa was\r\nmuch perplexed; neither she nor Bella could understand how it had\r\ncome about; there was no explanation, except that Bill had availed\r\nherself of their permission to change her mind, and that somehow seemed\r\nunlikely. Bella was inclined to blame Gilchrist, and cited several\r\ninstances when his devotion had fallen short of Jack’s. Theresa, on\r\nthe other hand, was for putting the change down to girlish caprice.\r\nShe made a point of talking to Gilchrist on the subject, but without\r\nenlightening herself to any great extent. “Of course I could not\r\ncross-question him,” she wrote to Polly, and was naturally not aware of\r\nthat lady’s wrathful exclamation,--“I know I could then!”\r\n\r\nAlthough Theresa did not hear this, or any other of Polly’s remarks,\r\nshe could guess their nature, and her invitation to Bill was given\r\npartly with a view of saving the girl from the ceaseless bombardment\r\nof the elder cousin’s wrath. As it happened, however, Polly was\r\ncomparatively merciful in her indignation; she knew when words were a\r\nwaste of breath, and understood with some precision when she could,\r\nand when she could not, move her partner. Consequently Bill was let\r\noff easily, and for that, or for some other reason, she did not seem\r\nat all unhappy when she stepped out on the platform at Wrugglesby\r\nstation. The sisters, who met her, recognised the fact at once, and\r\nBella at least was glad of it as she helped to carry Polly’s hat-box\r\nto the pony-carriage. Bill talked a good deal on the homeward way,\r\nseeming anything but depressed. Once when they were clear of the town\r\nshe looked round and said softly: “How beautiful it is! How very, very\r\nbeautiful it is out here!”\r\n\r\nBella thought the girl must be expressing her delight at leaving\r\nLondon and all her troubles behind her. She could see no beauty in the\r\nlandscape,--bare fields spread wide beneath the winter sky; gaunt,\r\nblack-limbed elms and leafless hedgerows where the twilight crept\r\nmysteriously; a pale flare of sunset breaking through the ashen clouds\r\nto make the level land luminous and show near objects with a wonderful\r\ndistinctness; stacks and barns and low-roofed cottages whence the\r\nsmoke in thin spirals went straightly up into the evening air.\r\n\r\nRobert came out to meet the pony-carriage with quite a cheerful smile\r\nof welcome.\r\n\r\n“Here, brother-in-law Laziness,” Bill said, filling his arms with\r\nTheresa’s parcels; “take some more, you can have these. I’ve got the\r\nsugar, T.”\r\n\r\nAnd they went indoors, Robert’s setter slobbering over Bill,--she\r\nnever had a dress that could be hurt by a dog’s caress--and sheepishly\r\nfollowing them into the forbidden precincts of the house.\r\n\r\n“You are jolly cold, I expect,” Robert said as he poked the fire into a\r\nblaze. “Get your boots off and warm your feet. Where are your slippers?\r\nIn this thing? Is this the key tied on outside?”\r\n\r\nBill said it was; in her opinion to tie its key to the handle of an\r\narticle was a sure way of having the key when you wanted it. Robert\r\nunfastened the box and rummaged over the contents with clumsy hands\r\ntill he found the shoes; afterwards he put the things back anyhow, so\r\nthat the box had to be carried up-stairs with the lid open.\r\n\r\nHow they talked that evening! Bella and Robert, even Theresa as well as\r\nBill. Bill wanted to know everything, about the horses and dogs, the\r\ncows and pigs; what that stack had yielded when it was threshed, how\r\nthe potatoes were keeping, why the long meadow was ploughed. She wanted\r\nto know all about everybody in the place, how they were and what new\r\nclothes they had; she wanted to know when Jack came last and when he\r\nwas coming next, what quantity of butter Theresa was getting now, and\r\nthe pattern of the lace Bella had bought for her petticoats.\r\n\r\nSomehow or other the commonplaces of life, the veriest trivialities\r\nassumed a vivid interest with Bill; the life which had seemed rather\r\ndull in the living became full of humour and incident when told to her.\r\nHer own life in London, when she told them about it, seemed almost\r\nfascinating. Bella found herself wishing that she had insisted on\r\njoining the lodging-venture; she did not realise that the life, like\r\nthe flat wintry landscape, required to be looked at through the lens of\r\na particular kind of mind to assume the aspect it did for Bill.\r\n\r\nOne could not help being conscious of Bill’s presence in the house. By\r\nthe next afternoon Theresa was beginning to be aware of the difference\r\nshe made. Bill had been in the attic that morning and looked over the\r\nnuts and apples that she herself had put there; she had brought down\r\nthe rotten ones and brought down also the rose-leaves, put away to dry\r\nand forgotten. She had been round the barns and stables and out into\r\nthe frozen garden, round the orchard to look for broken branches and\r\ndead wood for burning, into the icy dairy to help Jessie and hear about\r\nher love-affairs.\r\n\r\n“It’s like openin’ the winders on a summer mornin’,” Jessie said, when\r\njust before dinner Bill passed the kitchen-door with some Christmas\r\nroses she had found in a sheltered corner of the garden. She had gone\r\nto the pantry to arrange them in a glass, singing as she did so.\r\nStrangely enough she had not sung or whistled since that September\r\nmorning at Bymouth when she mimicked the birds while Kit Harborough\r\nwrung out her wet bathing-dress. But she did not know this, neither\r\ndid Jessie, though she heard the singing appreciatively now. Still, it\r\nwas not that which caused her remark when Bill, now quiet, passed the\r\nkitchen-door.\r\n\r\n“It do freshen the house up wonderfully to have you here again, miss;\r\nit’s for all the world like openin’ the winders on a sunny mornin’.”\r\n\r\nBut Bill scarcely understood the allusion any more than Theresa did the\r\nfact. Theresa certainly did not understand; she was glad to have the\r\ngirl back again, but she felt that she was more incomprehensible than\r\never. Her whole attitude towards Gilchrist and the broken engagement\r\nwas extraordinary to Theresa. She questioned Bill of course, and\r\nlearned practically nothing, though her questions were answered freely\r\nenough. Bill was glad when the questioning was over; she was very tired\r\nof the subject and she wanted to hear about Bella’s _trousseau_; also\r\nshe wanted to go and see Mr. Dane.\r\n\r\nMr. Dane knew nothing about the engagement; there was no reason now\r\nwhy Bill should tell him, yet that afternoon, as she knelt on his\r\nhearth-rug in the twilight, she suddenly determined to do so and to\r\nask his opinion on her own course of action. It was after one of those\r\npleasant, companionable silences which often fell between them that she\r\napproached the subject, entirely without introduction, as was her way.\r\n“Monseigneur,” she said abruptly, “do you think it is ever right to\r\nbreak a promise,--a promise to marry someone, I mean?”\r\n\r\n“To marry someone?” Mr. Dane repeated, and though his tone was only\r\nsurprised there was a gravity in his manner as if he feared trouble in\r\nthe near future. “Yes,” he said after a moment’s consideration, “in\r\nsome circumstances I do think it right to break such a promise.”\r\n\r\n“What circumstances?”\r\n\r\n“If the person giving the promise finds out afterwards that he or she\r\ndoes not love the one to whom it is given.”\r\n\r\n“If one of the two finds that out?” Bill said in surprise. “You do not\r\nreally think that is enough? You would not break a promise for that,\r\nyou would not think it honourable; it would not be either--neither\r\nhonourable nor right.”\r\n\r\n“It would not be right for some people,” Mr. Dane admitted; “but for\r\nothers--” he broke off abruptly, and after a pause turned to her with\r\nan almost terrible earnestness. “Child,” he said, “do not think I am\r\ntrifling with right and wrong; indeed I am not. Yet still I say that,\r\nthough it might not be honourable for some to break such a promise, for\r\nyou it would not be a question of honour or dishonour but of absolute\r\nnecessity.”\r\n\r\n“I did not think so.”\r\n\r\n“You?” he exclaimed with an excitement which astonished her; “you did\r\nnot think so?”\r\n\r\n“No,” she said, “I did not. I promised to marry Gilchrist Harborough,\r\nbut I did not love him.”\r\n\r\n“Then, in God’s name, do not marry him! You don’t know what you are\r\ndoing. Do you think it worse to break your promise and dishonour your\r\nword, or to break a man’s heart and dishonour him, yourself, and God’s\r\nlaw, all that is most holy and most binding on earth?”\r\n\r\nAnd then Bill realised what she had done, and how her words had wounded\r\nher friend. Had he not married a woman who did not love? Had he not\r\nsuffered to the full the uttermost bitterness of which he spoke? As\r\nshe realised how she had reopened the tragedy of his life the girl\r\nwas struck dumb with remorse, too grieved for the moment to think of\r\nexplaining the circumstances of her own affairs.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Dane did not know the reason of her silence, and he went on,\r\nhis face drawn and stern. “You do not know your own history nor the\r\ndanger which may threaten you. I do; and knowing, I say you must not,\r\ncannot marry a man you do not truly love. It is a mockery to pray ‘lead\r\nus not into temptation’ and then to put yourself in temptation’s way.\r\nThere is a passion which is stronger than you; it may sleep now but it\r\nwill not always sleep, believe me, it will not always sleep. Listen\r\nnow: first concerning your mother. You did not know her, neither did I,\r\nbut you yourself told me she married in defiance of her parents; she\r\nloved the man and counted them well lost for him. And he,--he loved\r\nher, bewitched her, desired her,--she had no will but to go,--I know\r\nhow it was done.”\r\n\r\n“You knew my father!”\r\n\r\n“No, I knew his father. I saw the spell at work; I know the will of\r\nthose Alardys and the power of their love; I have good reason to know.\r\nYour grandmother, the first Wilhelmina, I knew her too. She was another\r\nman’s wife; she married him though she did not love him; she thought it\r\nwas safe; she did not know--then came this other--”\r\n\r\nHe stopped abruptly. He was pacing the far side of the room with\r\nthe restlessness almost of a young man; he stood in the shadow now,\r\nbut she sat regarding him wide-eyed, something almost of horror in\r\nher face. That he should tear open these old wounds for her, his\r\nwife’s grandchild, Wilhelmina’s grandchild! Wilhelmina! Yes, she knew\r\nnow, the links in the chain were joined and she knew, although she\r\nmurmured,--“My grandmother, Wilhelmina Corby?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, and then he came into the firelight and his face was\r\nvery pitiful. “Child, child,” he said sadly, “there are passions of\r\nwhich you know nothing; pray God you never may!”\r\n\r\nThe girl’s eyes suddenly filled with tears: “Do you not hate me?” she\r\nwhispered.\r\n\r\nBut he did not hate her. The blessed years which had taught him not to\r\nhate, taught him to be merciful as well as just. “No, Princess Puck,”\r\nhe said, smiling gently, “I do not think I hate you.”\r\n\r\nShe crept dog-like to his side of the fire. “Shall I tell you\r\nsomething,” he said, reaching a hand down to touch her hair, “something\r\nwhich I do not count the least of my blessings this year?--God’s\r\ngoodness in sending to me, whom He has denied wife or child, a little\r\nbrown elf for a granddaughter.”\r\n\r\nBill could not speak. She only mutely pressed against his chair, and\r\nfor a long time they sat silent while he softly stroked her hair and\r\nthe ashes fell quietly on the hearth. At last the old man spoke again;\r\nhe had been thinking of the girl’s half-made confidence and it troubled\r\nhim greatly. “This promise of which you spoke,” he said,--“is it to be\r\nkept or broken?”\r\n\r\nBill started like one awakening. “Broken,” she said, “I have broken\r\nit”; and she told him the whole story, always, of course, excepting\r\nthat which was said, or rather was not said, when she and Kit\r\nHarborough met under the beeches on a day when a dream proved to be a\r\ndream no longer. But perhaps Mr. Dane discovered a little of that for\r\nhimself, for when he said good-bye to her that night he realised that\r\nhis Princess Puck was a child no more."

      "content": "A CHIP OF THE OLD BLOCK.\r\n\nIt was towards the end of January that Bella came to town to finish\r\nbuying her _trousseau_. A _trousseau_ is a really momentous affair,\r\nand Bella, feeling that the shops at Wrugglesby were not equal to the\r\noccasion, came to Bayswater, where Polly gave her limitless advice and\r\nall the help in her power. Polly really enjoyed Bella’s visit, and\r\nBill, who knew Polly’s weakness, did all the housework so that the\r\nelder cousin should be free to go shopping or help with the needlework\r\naccording as opportunity offered. During the time Bella was in London\r\nit seemed to Bill that they thought of, talked of, and considered very\r\nlittle beyond clothes, except perhaps once or twice in the evenings\r\nwhen Bella told them a little about Ashelton. Such conversations did\r\nnot interest Polly, but as Bill liked them Bella talked to her. Once\r\nindeed Polly showed some interest, when Bella spoke of the change in\r\nTheresa and Robert.\r\n\r\n“They both have altered a good deal,” she concluded,--“especially\r\nRobert. You saw him at Christmas, Bill; don’t you think he is changing?”\r\n\r\n“Not changing exactly,” Bill said, “he is,--I think he is developing,\r\ngrowing to what you would expect. Some kinds of people are bound to\r\ngrow in particular kinds of ways; they can hardly help themselves.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t like Robert’s kind of way, then. I think he has changed a good\r\ndeal, and for the worse; so would you if you had stayed at Haylands as\r\nlong as I have.”\r\n\r\nBill did not explain that what Bella called “a change for the worse”\r\nand she “a natural growing” were one and the same thing; she did not\r\nsay anything about it, though she felt a good deal, and knew that she\r\ncould not help Theresa now any more than she could have helped her last\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nBella had gone on to speak of the change in Theresa and of the quiet\r\nof Haylands. “Hardly a soul comes there now,” she said; “Theresa\r\nkeeps them all at arm’s length. I expect that is why Miss Minchin and\r\nMrs. Johnson and the rest of them never come now. Of course Gilchrist\r\nHarborough would not come.”\r\n\r\nPolly heaved a sigh. “I expect Bill’s breaking with Gilchrist troubled\r\nTheresa a good deal,” she said.\r\n\r\nBut Bella laughed at such an idea, and afterwards went on to speak of\r\nGilchrist and the lawsuit. “He has so little spare time just now,”\r\nshe said, “that I don’t believe he would go to see anyone except on\r\nbusiness. Jack sees him sometimes, and that is how I get to hear about\r\nhim and his case. He is rather disgusted with it just now, Jack says,\r\nabuses the lawyers, and professes a great contempt for the slowness of\r\nthe law.”\r\n\r\nBill opened her eyes. “Why,” she said, “he has only just begun! It will\r\nbe two years before it is over. What did he expect?”\r\n\r\n“How do you know?” demanded Polly.\r\n\r\n“I was told,” Bill answered, and Bella saved her further explanation by\r\nremarking: “That is what Mr. Stevens says; he told Jack so, and Jack\r\ntold Gilchrist.”\r\n\r\n“What did he say?” Bill inquired.\r\n\r\n“Oh, that he did not see how they were going to make the time out, but\r\nhe supposed they would do it somehow. Jack said he seemed disgusted\r\nwith everything that day, and vowed he would not mind selling his\r\nchances for a good sum down.”\r\n\r\n“Did he say that?” Bill asked quickly. “He told Jack that? But he\r\ncouldn’t do it, he couldn’t sell his chances; they would be no good to\r\nanyone else.”\r\n\r\n“He could sell them to the other side,” Bella said with the pride of\r\nrecently acquired knowledge. “Jack told me that if the Harboroughs were\r\nrich they would probably by the autumn, if his claim seemed pretty\r\ngood, try to compromise,--pay him to withdraw, you know. But then they\r\nare not rich; they have no spare money at all, and Jack says he does\r\nnot think they could raise any. It seems rather a pity, for Jack says\r\nhe believes Gilchrist would agree to a reasonable arrangement; he\r\ndoes not care a bit about Wood Hall now and only wants to go back to\r\nAustralia.”\r\n\r\n“We all know why that is,” Polly said with pious conviction. “Bill has\r\nonly herself to thank if he does leave England like that.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t suppose it would make any difference to Bill if he did go,”\r\nBella retorted; “and she certainly has nothing to do with his wanting\r\nto go. Jack says he is disgusted with people in general, with the\r\nlawyers and the other claimant much more than with Bill.”\r\n\r\n“Poor Gilchrist!” Polly said with commiseration, and continued to look\r\nin a meaning manner at Bill, who, however, was far too absorbed in the\r\nthoughts suggested to her by Bella’s words to heed her.\r\n\r\nLong that night she lay thinking of these new ideas, her brain full\r\nof conflicting thoughts, impossible plans, crazy fancies. Money,\r\nmoney,--she had never felt the want of it before, never, for all her\r\npoverty, felt any desire to be rich. She had always been poor and she\r\nhad never minded; she had never been tempted by girlish superfluities,\r\nhad never cared for ribbons and lace and nice food. But now,--now she\r\nwanted money desperately, not a few shillings, or a few pounds as\r\nPolly, who did mind being poor, wanted it; but money in the big sense\r\nof the word, in the sense in which Polly never wanted it, in which she\r\nherself had hardly contemplated it before. Not that it mattered whether\r\nshe wanted much or little, shillings or pounds or hundreds of pounds;\r\none seemed about as attainable as the other.\r\n\r\nIt was always part of Bill’s work to get up and clean the boots and\r\nlight the fires before breakfast; it was no very great effort to her,\r\nand seemed moreover to fall naturally to her share. On the morning\r\nafter she had lain so long thinking over the problem of ways and means,\r\nshe got up as usual, cleaned the lodgers’ boots, lighted the fires,\r\nwashed her hands, and then, taking a candle from the kitchen-dresser,\r\nclimbed on the back of a chair that stood against the wall. Moving\r\nan almanack hanging high above it, a hole became visible from which\r\nshe drew out, wrapped in paper, Peter Harborough’s shoe-buckles. For\r\na long time she stood looking at them. Once she rubbed them on the\r\ncorner of her apron; once she held them close to the candle so that the\r\nbrilliant, refracted light flashed back from the gems and scattered\r\nsparks of white fire over her face and hands. She could not tell what\r\nthey were worth, perhaps a hundred pounds, perhaps two hundred,--Polly\r\nhad said two; diamonds were very valuable she knew, but how valuable\r\nshe could not tell. At last she wrapped the buckles up again, put them\r\nback in their hiding-place and went about her work with a thoughtful\r\nface.\r\n\r\nShe wore a thoughtful face all that day, for she was revolving a plan\r\nin her mind. In the afternoon she went to her bedroom and there opened\r\nthe little oak box which used to stand in the spare room at Langford\r\nHouse. She had only been to it once since last winter, but now she\r\nturned over its contents carefully. She was not much the wiser for her\r\nexamination; the only papers old enough to interest her conveyed little\r\nto her mind, beyond the indisputable fact that the name Corby appeared\r\nin them. However, her failure to find anything important in the little\r\nchest did not alter her plans, and in the evening, when the elder\r\ncousins were at leisure, she spoke to Polly about them. Bella and Polly\r\nhad been busy with the _trousseau_ all day, but by the evening they\r\nwere able to listen to Bill when she informed them that she was going\r\nto Wrugglesby the next day.\r\n\r\n“To Wrugglesby!” Bella exclaimed. “What on earth are you going there\r\nfor?”\r\n\r\nBut this Bill was not prepared to say; she expected to be asked\r\nthe question and several others, and to give much annoyance by not\r\nanswering them, but it could not be avoided. She felt that she could\r\nnot explain matters yet. Things fell out exactly as she anticipated;\r\nBella was only curious, but Polly was decidedly angry; she felt that\r\nshe had a right to inquire, and she exercised it,--with no good\r\nresults, for when, on Bill’s refusing to assign any reasons, she\r\nforbade her going to Wrugglesby, the girl showed every intention of\r\ngoing in spite of her. Whereupon Polly, who by this time knew she\r\ncould not always drive the stubborn Bill, became very dignified,\r\nretreating from her post of dictator behind a manner of superior and\r\nchilling indifference, after which she climbed down from her pinnacle\r\nof outraged authority and informed the offender that she should not pay\r\nher fare.\r\n\r\n“No, of course not,” Bill said readily; “I have some money.”\r\n\r\nAnd she had; for it so happened that after a battle royal with Polly\r\none day she had succeeded in arranging for wages of a pound a month,\r\nthe same as any other little servant. Polly had vowed that she should\r\nnot have it, that she was a partner in the firm and not a paid servant,\r\nbut Bill stood to her guns, foregoing any future profits but insisting\r\non present wages; and as she struck work when they were not paid she\r\ncontrived to get them regularly, and so to have a little money for an\r\nemergency. Remembering which Polly said ungraciously: “At any rate you\r\ncan’t go until the one o’clock train.”\r\n\r\nThe one o’clock train was a very slow one, but it suited Bill\r\nadmirably, and by it she went the next day.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly three when the one clerk who looked out on Wrugglesby\r\nHigh Street from Mr. Stevens’s office-window saw the small figure cross\r\nthe road and come towards the door.\r\n\r\n“A lady to see you, sir,--Miss Alardy.”\r\n\r\nThe clerk announced this to his employer, although he thought Miss\r\nAlardy an exceedingly young lady to consult a lawyer on her own\r\naccount. Mr. Stevens thought so too; he had a hazy recollection on\r\nhearing the name that she must be one of Miss Brownlow’s nieces, but\r\nhe was not sure of the relationship until he saw the girl. Then he\r\nremembered her as the youngest of the nieces, the one whom, it seemed\r\nonly the other day, he used to see walking beside the governess with a\r\ndusky mane of hair hanging about her shoulders and a general appearance\r\nsuggestive of a tendency to turn restive on provocation.\r\n\r\n“Well, and what has brought you to Wrugglesby?” he said when he had\r\nasked after the other cousins. No one treated Bill in a business-like\r\nway; even the grocer at Bayswater regarded her as a man and a brother.\r\nMr. Stevens certainly had no idea of being professionally consulted by\r\nthis slip of a girl.\r\n\r\n“I have come to see you,” she answered simply. “I want to ask you a\r\nquestion, a law question.”\r\n\r\nShe had her purse in her hand and looked somehow as if she were\r\nprepared to pay six-and-eightpence, cash down, for his opinion.\r\n\r\n“I will try to answer you,” he said with as much gravity as he could\r\ncontrive. “What is this question?”\r\n\r\n“It begins in the year 1799,” she said without more ado. “In that\r\nyear a man, Roger Corby,--perhaps you have heard of him? But that\r\ndoes not matter--in the year 1799 he gave a piece of land to another\r\nman--Briant. He gave it for ninety-nine years, but no rent was to be\r\npaid.”\r\n\r\n“A lease, that is,” the lawyer said, “and the rental probably one\r\npeppercorn payable if demanded. Yes, proceed.”\r\n\r\n“This year,” Bill said, “the time will be up, and I imagine Roger Corby\r\nwould get his land back if he were alive?”\r\n\r\n“Naturally.”\r\n\r\n“But he is not alive, so I suppose his descendants would get it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that is what is usually expected to take place.”\r\n\r\n“He has only got one descendant; she comes like this,” and Bill took\r\nup some books which lay on the table. “Roger Corby’s only son died a\r\nyear after him,”--she put a thin black book down,--“he is dead, you\r\nsee”--pushing the book away--“and so does not count. The son’s only\r\nchild, a daughter, is dead too, but she married when she was fairly\r\nyoung and she married twice. She ran away from her first husband and\r\nhe divorced her; then she married the other man and had one son, the\r\nonly child she had. Well, the son is dead too and the only person left\r\nis his daughter. Would she be able to get the land at the end of the\r\nninety-nine years?”\r\n\r\n“Most probably, if she has the necessary documents and can prove she is\r\nlegally descended from Roger Corby.”\r\n\r\nBill said “Thank you,” and sat thinking a minute. The lawyer watched\r\nher curiously, feeling sure there must be something behind all this,\r\nand wondering a little what it could be.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Briant,” Bill said at last,--“I mean the Mr. Briant who now has\r\nthe land--does not think it will be claimed, at least I believe not; he\r\nprobably does not know of the second marriage of Wilhelmina Corby, and\r\nthe son and the granddaughter.”\r\n\r\n“Which means,” Stevens observed, “that he will very strongly object to\r\nacknowledging their existence and will do his best to keep what he has\r\ngot. Were I the granddaughter, I think I should first make quite sure\r\nthat the thing in question is worth fighting for, and also I should be\r\nvery clear that Wilhelmina Corby was divorced from her first husband\r\nand legally married to her second; can you tell me these things?”\r\n\r\nBill could tell him one of the things. “Do you know Sandover?” she\r\nasked. “Yes? A good part of Sandover now stands on the land; of course\r\nat the time it was given it was only corn fields and grass, but now it\r\nmust be valuable.”\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens whistled, although it was supposed to be a business\r\ninterview. “It is worth something, I admit. Now for Wilhelmina\r\nCorby,--how about her?”\r\n\r\n“It would have to be found out,” Bill said, “but I believe it is all\r\nright. But tell me, what did you mean by necessary documents?”\r\n\r\n“First and principally the counterpart of the lease. You don’t know\r\nwhat that is? It is an exact copy of the deed, the lease which is in\r\npossession of the man who now has the land and by right of which he has\r\nit. There is certain to have been such a deed; this man, Briant, is\r\nsure to have his lease, and unless the granddaughter can produce her\r\ncounterpart she would find it well-nigh impossible to prove her case.\r\nHas she got it, do you think?”\r\n\r\nBill did not know, and Mr. Stevens went on to say:--“In the first\r\ninstance it would probably have been among Roger Corby’s papers, and\r\nso it may have passed into his granddaughter’s keeping; if it did,\r\nthe question is what became of it when she changed husbands? And if\r\nshe kept it in her possession, has her granddaughter got it still, or\r\nfailing that, is it possible to trace it?”\r\n\r\nBill considered a while; she was thinking of the little oak box and her\r\nsearch in it. “There is an oak box,” she said at last; “it is used\r\nas an ottoman in my bedroom, but I have heard that it belonged to my\r\ngrandmother. It is full of papers, mostly letters and recipes of my\r\nmother’s, but there are a few which are older, one or two very large,\r\ntough, yellowish ones, not written in the ordinary way. I looked at\r\nthem yesterday but I could not make them out, except that the name\r\nCorby occurs in them, and that at least one has the date 1799. Do you\r\nthink the thing we want is there?”\r\n\r\n“I think it is just possible.” Mr. Stevens was not altogether surprised\r\nat this dropping of the impersonal. “So you are the granddaughter of\r\nWilhelmina Corby, are you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I did not bring the box with me, but I wish I had now.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps there is nothing of value in it. What are these old papers\r\nlike? Can you describe them to me?”\r\n\r\nBill did as well as she could, and though the description was not very\r\ndetailed Mr. Stevens seemed satisfied. “I do not know,” he said, “if\r\nyou have the counterpart, but I should say from what you tell me that\r\nyou must have one or two of the old Corby documents. Don’t think that\r\nI mean they are of any pecuniary value, as the chances are all against\r\nit; the counterpart, if we could find it, might be, but the others are\r\njust so much legal lumber.”\r\n\r\nBill did not seem troubled by this discouraging remark, nor yet by the\r\nlawyer’s next words: “If it is not a rude question, may I ask how much\r\nof all this does your cousin’s solicitor know?”\r\n\r\n“We have not got a solicitor,” Bill answered readily. “Mr. Brownlow\r\nmade Aunt Isabel’s will, but he is dead now, and when he was alive we\r\ndid not see anything of him. Polly thought him very stupid.”\r\n\r\n“Polly? That’s Miss Hains, is it not? Has your coming to me her\r\nsanction?”\r\n\r\nIt had not, for the very good reason that Bill had not consulted her\r\non the subject, or even informed her that any such subject existed;\r\naccordingly she told Mr. Stevens so, and explained that the affair was\r\nher own entirely.\r\n\r\n“Am I to understand,” the puzzled man enquired, “that she knows nothing\r\nat all about this?”\r\n\r\n“No,” Bill told him, “she doesn’t even know my grandmother was a Corby.\r\nI did not know much myself before Christmas, and when I did know, it\r\nhardly seemed worth while telling her. I did not realise then that it\r\nmight be valuable; I did not realise that till the night before last.”\r\n\r\n“The night before last? What happened then?”\r\n\r\n“I wanted money desperately, and I thought and thought of ways of\r\ngetting it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens repressed an inclination to smile. “You have by no means\r\ngot it yet in spite of your interesting story,” he said. “Let me\r\nenumerate some of the difficulties in the way. Supposing you have\r\nthe counterpart of the lease and it is all correct, you have got to\r\nbe sure of several things,--that none of all these people between\r\nyourself and Roger Corby were bankrupt, that they made no awkward\r\nmarriage-settlements, and, if they died intestate, left no more than\r\none child apiece to survive them.”\r\n\r\n“These things will have to be found out,” Bill said calmly.\r\n“Marriage-settlements I don’t know anything about; children I do. There\r\nwere no more than I have said, or at least none that lived to grow up;\r\nI have no relations at all on my father’s side. As for bankrupt, I\r\nbelieve it is all right, but I am not sure; Roger Corby died in debt,\r\nthough I think it was all paid off after his death. But I know he was\r\nin debt when he died, that is why Wilhelmina, my grandmother, had his\r\nbody carried away by night.”\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens had heard something of this story, but always believed it\r\nto be a mere local tradition. “I had no idea it really happened,” he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nBill assured him that she had excellent reasons for believing that\r\nit did; then she returned to the subject of more direct interest to\r\nherself. “Supposing,” she said, “that all these things of which you\r\nspoke were right, what then?”\r\n\r\n“Then, if you can get over the difficulty of the divorce and remarriage\r\nand subsequent birth of a son, you should have a very good case and\r\nought, if all goes well, eventually to get the money you so much need;\r\nor rather certain persons in authority would get it to hold in trust\r\nfor you.”\r\n\r\n“In trust for me?” Bill said with rather an anxious look.\r\n\r\n“Certainly; you are not of age yet, are you? Eighteen! The law does\r\nnot consider you of age till you are twenty-one. Until that time the\r\nmoney, if you get it, will be in the hands of guardians who will manage\r\nit entirely and only allow you the use of a moderate and reasonable\r\nproportion.”\r\n\r\n“Polly and Theresa are called my guardians; would they have to look\r\nafter the money?”\r\n\r\n“That depends,” Mr. Stevens said. “If they are only ‘called’ your\r\nguardians, the court, if the case were decided in your favour, would\r\nappoint some one to look after you and your money, you would be a\r\nward of the court, and the court takes very great care of its wards\r\nand looks after them in a manner not always permitted to parents\r\nnowadays. If, on the other hand, your cousins are legally appointed\r\nyour guardians, they would, until you were twenty-one, have the control\r\nof your property, applying it solely for your benefit and allowing you\r\na certain amount for your use. But, remember, they could not do as\r\nthey chose with it, for they could be called upon to give a very exact\r\naccount of their proceedings.”\r\n\r\nBill breathed a sigh of relief. “That’s all right,” she said. “Polly\r\nand Theresa, more especially Polly, are set down in Aunt Isabel’s will\r\nas my guardians; I should be able to manage if I got the money.”\r\n\r\n“They would not allow you more than a comparatively small sum; you\r\ncould not touch any great amount. I don’t fancy you would be much\r\nbetter off than under the court if you wanted to do anything foolish,\r\nunless of course, the folly took the form of an unwise marriage, when\r\nyou certainly would have more liberty if you were not a ward of the\r\ncourt.”\r\n\r\nBill laughed softly. “I will tell you what I will do if I get the\r\nmoney,” she said. “I shall give Polly so much a year for the rest of\r\nher life; she deserves it and I would give her as much as I could\r\nafford; and with the rest I should do what I liked. We should arrange\r\nit somehow; Polly would do as I told her. There is time at least to try\r\nto find some way of doing it legally, but if I could not find one I\r\ndon’t see that it would so very much matter, because Polly would be the\r\nperson who did wrong according to the law and I should be the person\r\nwho suffered wrong, and consequently the one who ought to have her\r\nup when I was old enough. As the case would really be the other way\r\nround, I should not have her up, and she could not have me up, so it\r\nwould be all right.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” Mr. Stevens remarked drily, “that is how you think you will\r\narrange matters, is it? It strikes me you are a worthy granddaughter of\r\nWilhelmina the wilful. I fancy, though, you will find more obstacles\r\nthan you bargain for in this little game; where, for instance, does the\r\nother cousin and guardian come in?”\r\n\r\n“I should have to explain to Theresa that it was right. You would think\r\nit so if you knew. Theresa will always do what she thinks right, and\r\nPolly will do what she is made to do. To get your own way is mostly a\r\nmatter of time.”\r\n\r\n“This time I should not be surprised if it took you till\r\none-and-twenty. Law is not so easy to play with as you think; and cases\r\nof this sort are not so easy to win either, neither are they settled in\r\na hurry.”\r\n\r\nBill was prepared for that. “How long do you think it would take?” she\r\nasked. “A year?”\r\n\r\n“Probably; it might be longer, or it might, if you have very good luck\r\nand few difficulties, be a little shorter.”\r\n\r\n“Would it cost a great deal?”\r\n\r\n“It could not be done for nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Would a hundred pounds be any good to start with?”\r\n\r\n“It would be excellent.”\r\n\r\nBill put her hand into her pocket and drew out the diamond buckles: “I\r\ndon’t know what they are worth,” she said as she placed them before the\r\nastonished lawyer, “but at least a hundred pounds; more than that, I\r\nexpect.”\r\n\r\n“Where did you get them?” Mr. Stevens had taken one to the window, and\r\nglanced from it to the girl.\r\n\r\n“Old Mr. Harborough gave them to me before he died.”\r\n\r\n“What!” The lawyer lost all interest in the buckles and stood staring\r\nat their owner, wondering what new surprise this granddaughter of the\r\nCorbys was going to develop.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Harborough gave them to me,” she repeated. “They are my very own;\r\nyoung Mr. Harborough was there at the time they were given, and he said\r\nthey were my own and no one could take them away. I did mean to keep\r\nthem for another purpose, but I believe it would be more right to use\r\nthem for this.”\r\n\r\n“Have you any idea what these buckles are worth?”\r\n\r\n“More than a hundred pounds,” Bill said readily; “they will do to begin\r\nthe case, won’t they?”\r\n\r\n“It is altogether extraordinary,” the lawyer muttered, and began to\r\nwrap the buckles in paper with the resigned air of one who gives up a\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nHe offered the parcel to Bill, but she put her hands behind her back;\r\n“I want you to keep them,” she said, “and begin at once.”\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps as well that Mr. Stevens was not busy that afternoon,\r\nfor he found there were several more points to be explained to his\r\nyoung client, among others that she herself could not bring an\r\naction or give directions for legal proceedings. This difficulty she\r\ndisposed of by undertaking to arrange matters with Polly within two\r\ndays. Another point the good man had to explain was that no one would\r\nundertake the case without first knowing a great deal more about\r\nit. This the indefatigable Bill met with a promise to send the oak\r\nbox to him by an early train the next morning, and to set to work at\r\nonce to find out any and every detail she could concerning the first\r\nWilhelmina. When at last Mr. Stevens, again handing her the buckles,\r\ntold her that her method of payment was not according to custom, she\r\nwas still not nonplussed. “Shall I get them sold,” she asked, “and give\r\nyou the money?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not; don’t attempt to sell them. And listen to me: I should\r\nnot in any circumstances undertake this business for you; I will\r\nexamine the contents of the box if you like, and tell you how I think\r\nyou stand; but I would not undertake the case, which is completely out\r\nof my range. I am a country lawyer with quite as much country work as I\r\ncan do; I am not a very young man, not a very poor one, and not at all\r\nan ambitious one. I have neither the time nor the inclination for such\r\na piece of work as this.”\r\n\r\n“But you could find someone who would do it?” Bill asked, not in the\r\nleast impressed by the gravity of his manner.\r\n\r\n“I suppose I could,” he said, smiling in spite of himself. “But even if\r\nI were to find someone, and there really was something for that someone\r\nto do, you must see that there are a good many things to settle before\r\nit comes to terms. When, and if, it does your cousin is the proper\r\nperson to be consulted.”\r\n\r\nBut Bill did not agree with him there. She pointed out that the affair\r\nwas hers and the buckles hers; still she conceded that Polly could be\r\ntalked to, and, since he wished it, she would take the buckles back to\r\ntown. She put them in her pocket again, to the no small uneasiness of\r\nMr. Stevens, although, as she herself said, they were too big to drop\r\nout, and no one would expect to find anything of value in her pocket.\r\n\r\nShe was about to leave, by no means dissatisfied with the interview,\r\nwhen Mr. Stevens made a remark which caused her to pause. After saying\r\nthat she must not make sure of her position, and that he himself could\r\ngive her no hope until he had examined the contents of the oak box,\r\nhe concluded: “And even if everything else proves satisfactory, it is\r\nquite possible you will come to grief over the matter of the divorce;\r\nthe other side would be sure to make the most of that; it will have to\r\nbe gone into very thoroughly.”\r\n\r\nBill stopped on the threshold. “Do you mean,” she asked, “that you\r\nwill have to go into it thoroughly, or that it will have to be done in\r\npublic?”\r\n\r\n“I should not have much to do with it, but both your lawyers and those\r\non the opposite side would have plenty; it is a point on which a good\r\ndeal might turn.”\r\n\r\n“I had not thought of that,” and Bill’s face clouded.\r\n\r\n“You had better think of it,” the lawyer said, “for it will certainly\r\narise. You must be sure, and the other side would insist on being sure,\r\nthat there was a divorce; they would want the date of it and the date\r\nof the second marriage and the date of the birth of the child.”\r\n\r\n“Will they want the name of the first husband?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\n“Will it be published in the papers?”\r\n\r\n“It would probably figure in the reports of the case.”\r\n\r\n“Then I am not at all sure the case can ever come off,” Bill said, to\r\nMr. Stevens’s great astonishment.\r\n\r\n“Why not?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Because the first husband is alive, and I would not hurt him for all\r\nthe world.”\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens regarded this as a matter of sentiment, but a sentiment he\r\ncould honour, though he hardly knew how to advise. “Well,” he said at\r\nlast, “you need not, and indeed cannot, do anything for a long time. I\r\nwill look over your papers and tell you how I think you stand, and by\r\nthat time you will have been able to decide what you wish to do.”\r\n\r\nBut this was not Bill’s manner of going to work at all. “Thank you very\r\nmuch,” she said, “but I think I must decide sooner than that. When does\r\nthe last up-train leave for London? Eight o’clock, is it? Thank you, I\r\nwill decide before that. Perhaps I had better not come to see you so\r\nlate; I will write from town.”\r\n\r\n“My dear young lady,” the lawyer said, moved by the gravity of her face\r\nand manner, “there is no need to take the matter so seriously, or to do\r\nanything in such a hurry. Send me the box, and afterwards we will talk\r\nover what can be done.”\r\n\r\nBut though Bill again thanked him, not disagreeing with him this time,\r\nhe was not at all sure that he had convinced her.\r\n\r\n“It’s a pity if she drops it,” he meditated as he watched her go down\r\nthe street. “She would win if she went in, somehow--and probably do\r\nprecisely what she pleased with her fortune when she got it. She is the\r\nkind that does; she would bamboozle the Court of Chancery and dance\r\nthrough an Act of Parliament.”"

      "content": "THE OAK BOX GOES TO WRUGGLESBY.\r\n\nThe waiting-room of a railway-station is not usually selected as the\r\nbest place in which to think seriously over a matter of perplexity.\r\nBut if the waiting-room be attached to the station at a very small\r\ncountry town where trains are infrequent and passengers few, a worse\r\nplace might be chosen; it has at least the merit of freedom from\r\nfriendly advice. Moreover the fact of a person sitting there doing\r\nabsolutely nothing for an hour or more creates no surprise, as it is\r\nto be presumed he is only waiting for the next train. On the January\r\nafternoon of Bill’s visit to Wrugglesby she found the waiting-room an\r\nadmirable place for quiet thought. When she left Mr. Stevens’s office\r\nshe went straight to the station and, sitting down with her back to the\r\nwindow, tried to think over the difficulties suggested by the lawyer’s\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties resolved themselves into one and one only,--Mr. Dane.\r\nThe other obstacles to the success of her undertaking might or might\r\nnot prove insurmountable; at any rate Bill would face them undauntedly\r\nwith a light heart and a clear conscience. But Mr. Dane was another\r\nmatter; she could not wilfully, and with her eyes open, do what she\r\nfelt sure would give him pain; and yet,--how could she give up this\r\nenterprise?\r\n\r\nAt this point two stout women entered the waiting-room. They were\r\ngoing to Darvel by the next down train in some twenty minutes’ time,\r\nand had walked in three miles from a neighbouring village; when\r\none walks three miles the balance of a spare half-hour is not much\r\nto allow for catching a train. They were in “nice time,” they told\r\neach other, though they seemed flustered and annoyed when they found\r\nthe booking-office still closed. Bill heard what they said without\r\nunderstanding, just as she saw them without perceiving; she sat looking\r\nstraight before her though her true gaze was inwards. They glanced at\r\nher once or twice. “A natural, poor thing,” was the conclusion they\r\ncame to. “They didn’t oughter let her be about alone like that,” was\r\ntheir final opinion as she rose from her seat and walked out of the\r\nwaiting-room.\r\n\r\nBill left the station, turned out of the main street, and took the\r\nroad to Ashelton. She had decided what to do: she would go to Mr.\r\nDane, not to ask his permission to claim her connection with the Corby\r\nfamily and consequently to drag him and his past before the eyes of his\r\nneighbours, but to tell him her story and ask his advice. She loved him\r\nso well that she felt sure he would give his advice without prejudice;\r\nshe was absolutely certain that he would not misunderstand or misjudge.\r\nShe started on her walk with a comparatively quiet mind, not an\r\nabsolutely quiet one, for she knew she must give a full confidence or\r\nnone at all. She must tell all, even including that which concerned\r\nKit Harborough, and the dream which was a dream no more.\r\n\r\nAt first Bill thought of nothing but what she had to tell, but bit\r\nby bit the solitude of the road and the exhilaration of the exercise\r\nsoothed her so that she thought no more. Six miles of lonely road, a\r\nlevel country wide spread and bare on either hand, a silent wintry\r\nafternoon with the suggestion of twilight gathering before the village\r\nwas reached,--what more could one ask to minister to a mind diseased?\r\nNothing in Bill’s opinion, as she walked the six miles in something\r\nunder an hour and a half, without a single doubt of her ability to walk\r\nthem back again after dark and her pleasure in doing it.\r\n\r\nBut she did not walk those six miles back; the proprietor of the White\r\nHorse at Ashelton received a request during the evening for the little\r\ncart and old pony for Mr. Dane. And it is to be presumed he drove Bill\r\nto Wrugglesby in time for the eight o’clock train, for some sort of\r\nvehicle brought her to the station in time for that train, and a little\r\nafter eight o’clock Mr. Dane rang at the private house of Stevens the\r\nlawyer.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stevens wanted very much to know what had brought Mr. Dane to see\r\nher husband at that time in the evening. She had a great opinion of\r\nMr. Dane, of whom she knew little, and of his Family (with a capital\r\nF), of which she knew less. She and Mr. Johnson had conferred more\r\nthan once on the subject of the relative who was a lord and the other\r\nrelative who was a bishop, and the mystery why Mr. Dane himself was--if\r\nnot a bishop or a lord--at least something more than a country parson.\r\nOn that particular evening, after Mr. Dane had left, Mrs. Stevens\r\nnaturally wished to know the reason of his visit; first she sought\r\nindirectly for information and learned nothing; then she asked boldly\r\nwhat had brought him there that night.\r\n\r\n“A small pony-cart, my dear,” Mr. Stevens said amiably; “and the same\r\nvehicle has taken him away again. I hope he will reach his destination\r\nsafely, for he is not as young as he was and the night is dark, though\r\nthe pony, I must admit, looks a safe beast.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Stevens, being somewhat annoyed by this answer, condescended to\r\nno more questions and maintained a dignified silence for the rest of\r\nthe evening,--a proceeding which it is to be feared did not greatly\r\ntrouble Mr. Stevens, since he was so completely engrossed in his own\r\nmeditations that he was not aware of it. After Mrs. Stevens had gone to\r\nbed he poked the fire into a blaze and observed to the crackling coals:\r\n“You were a fool, Wilhelmina the first, a fool! You threw away a very\r\nfine and noble gentleman for your gipsy lover.” And being a country\r\nlawyer of somewhat prosaic practice, and being also a man of genial\r\nsympathies, he once more gave himself up to meditations on the story\r\nwhich had been told him that night.\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Dane, having reached home in safety, also thought a little\r\nof the story which had been revived that night. But not for long; he\r\nresolutely put it away from him as he put away the diamond buckles\r\nBill had left. She had left them on purpose and with a definite\r\nunderstanding. “You must keep them, Monseigneur,” she said. “I can\r\nreclaim them, if I ever have the money, and if you do not sell them\r\nbefore. I cannot have you undertake this great thing for me unless you\r\nwill have them as a sort of guarantee; I would rather you kept them;\r\nit is better so.” So he kept them, for after he had seen how she\r\ncarried them loose in her pocket and heard how she kept them in a hole\r\nin the kitchen-wall, he also thought that it was better so.\r\n\r\nBill went back to London without her buckles, but Polly was not aware\r\nof the fact. Indeed Polly did not hear anything much about the visit\r\nto Wrugglesby that evening, for Bill did not reach home till late, too\r\nlate to tell all about it, she said, and put off the explanation till\r\nthe next day, when she promised to tell Polly everything. Bella was\r\nrather disappointed by this arrangement for she would be out then,--at\r\nthe dressmaker’s in the morning and at Mrs. James Brownlow’s in the\r\nafternoon. It must be admitted that, fond as Bill was of her cousin,\r\nBella’s absence suited her well, for she wanted to have a long and\r\nsomewhat difficult talk with Polly.\r\n\r\nBella went out early, and early also went the little oak box by rail\r\nto Wrugglesby, carefully addressed and properly insured as Mr. Stevens\r\nhad impressed upon Bill it must be. Before it went she pulled off the\r\nchintz cover from the top and took one thing from the inside; not a\r\ndocument or deed, or even one of her mother’s recipes, only a fossil\r\nsea-urchin found on the beach at Bymouth on a sweet September morning.\r\nShe hid it away among her linen; then she nailed down the lid of the\r\nbox, tied a rope round it, and sent it away.\r\n\r\nPolly did not know it had gone until later when Bill told her in the\r\ncourse of their talk. This talk did not prove so difficult as Bill had\r\nanticipated, for Polly was quick to grasp the possibilities of the\r\ncase. It was true, Bill had acted without her consent and in a measure\r\noutraged her in her part of guardian; but Polly was not always playing\r\nthat part, and she was, as the late Mr. Brownlow had said, a capital\r\nwoman of business; when it came to plain facts apart from appearances,\r\nBill’s conduct and communication wore a very different aspect. As\r\nPolly said: “You risk nothing; even if you lose you are no worse off\r\nthan you were except for those diamond buckles--” (here, in spite of a\r\nprevious and very eloquent statement of her opinion of Bill’s giving\r\nthem up, Polly could not forbear from making a short digression and\r\nrecapitulation of her sentiments)--“except for those buckles, you lose\r\nnothing since Mr. Dane is going to advance the money and take all the\r\ntrouble. You are quite sure he means you only to pay if you win? You\r\nlose nothing if you fail and if you succeed--well!”\r\n\r\nThe prospect seemed almost too much for Polly, and Bill forbore to\r\nmention any of her own plans regarding the money, should she win it.\r\nPolly, of course, had something to say about the way in which she had\r\nnot been consulted, though not much, for, as she admitted, Bill “had\r\ndone very well”; moreover, she was somewhat mollified by the nominal\r\nshare in future transactions which Bill assured her would be hers. Bill\r\nexplained matters as clearly as she could to Polly’s great satisfaction\r\nand sufficient enlightenment. In a matter of this sort Polly was quick\r\nto grasp the essential points, and in a matter of any sort even quicker\r\nto accommodate herself to the part she was to play. There was one\r\nthing, however, which Polly did not understand, and which Bill would\r\nnot explain,--the reason that had induced Mr. Dane to follow such an\r\nextraordinary course as he had, and not only to give his sanction to\r\nthe proceedings but also to lend active and financial assistance.\r\n\r\n“I can’t tell you,” was all Bill would say; “you would not understand.\r\nI hardly know myself and I certainly can’t explain. I can’t talk about\r\nhim, he is,--he is too good.”\r\n\r\nPolly was not satisfied, but she could get no other explanation,\r\nand when Bill left her after some rather able though unsuccessful\r\ncross-examination, she hurled after her as a parting shot: “It is a\r\nvery peculiar thing, Bill, very peculiar indeed, the way in which\r\nelderly gentlemen do things for you. One gives you a pair of diamond\r\nbuckles, and another is undertaking a law-case for you. It is most\r\npeculiar, not to put too fine a point upon it,--most peculiar!”\r\n\r\nAnd though Polly went to the kitchen-door and raised her voice so that\r\nBill, who had gone up-stairs, should not lose any of the remark, she\r\nstill contrived to throw a vast deal of meaning into the last words and\r\nthe sniff which followed them. But Bill, if she heard, did not answer,\r\nwhich was wise; and Polly, who was too satisfied with the results of\r\nBill’s “peculiarity” to trouble very much about explanations, went back\r\nto her work and asked no more unanswerable questions.\r\n\r\nBella and Theresa had to be taken into confidence of course, but\r\nneither of them thought the matter so important as Bill and Polly did.\r\nIt was interesting to know all about Bill’s people, but the substantial\r\nbenefits to be reaped from it seemed uncertain and shadowy. “It was all\r\nrather improbable and unwise,” Theresa said, while Bella, being full of\r\nher own concerns, hardly understood what was being discussed; and both\r\nsisters entirely failed to realise the value of success should it ever\r\nbe attained.\r\n\r\n“They are so stupid,” Polly once said impatiently; “they don’t grasp\r\nanything out of their own groove. I’ve no patience with either of\r\nthem; they are thorough Brownlows, without an ounce of vitality\r\nbetween them. They’re all right so long as you put them in ordinary\r\ncircumstances,--a decent house with a decent servant, decent meals at\r\nregular hours, and a decent husband to come home at regular times and\r\nprovide the money. But as for striking out a line for themselves, or\r\nsaving a situation, or doing or even understanding anything which is\r\nout of their ordinary rut or wants a small amount of enterprise, they\r\nsimply can’t do it!”\r\n\r\nBill laughed a little, though she could not deny the truth of at least\r\npart of the indictment. She could not deny to herself either that this\r\nsame characteristic of the sisters made it easier for her to carry\r\nthrough, unquestioned and undisturbed, the enterprises which they\r\ncould neither undertake nor understand. However, she did not remark on\r\nthis to Polly, but merely said: “I think Bella and T. are both rather\r\noccupied with their own concerns just now.”\r\n\r\nPolly would not allow this excuse to Theresa, though she admitted it\r\nmight hold good for Bella, whose wedding-day was so near. Bella’s\r\nwedding occupied all their minds about this time, Polly being\r\ndetermined that it should be of suitable though quiet magnificence.\r\n“Of course we are still in mourning,” she said, “or at least we can\r\nreckon we are; Aunt was almost like a mother to us, besides an out of\r\nmourning wedding would cost so much. As it is, we can make a very good\r\nshow indeed at a reasonable price. And I mean to do it too, Bill; we\r\nare quite as good as the Dawsons, and I’m not going to let them think\r\nwe are not.” And Polly made all the preparations in her power; her\r\nchief cause of trouble being that, since Bella was to be married at\r\nAshelton, she herself could not be at the base of operations very long\r\nbeforehand.\r\n\r\nBella left town early in February, in the company of Jack, who had come\r\nto town on business. When Polly heard of his coming she regretted that\r\nshe could not offer him the hospitality she had offered Gilchrist, but\r\nher house was too full now to allow of it. However, Jack came to see\r\nthem and stopped some time, and was, as Polly said, “as pleasant as\r\npossible and quite different from Mr. Gilchrist Harborough.” Indeed,\r\nJack, instead of disapproving of Bill’s working, insisted on helping\r\nher to clear the table, making much fun over it. He always seemed to\r\nregard Bill as a jolly little school-girl not to be taken seriously;\r\nthat day he teased her about the apples she took to eat in the train\r\non her journey to Bymouth. Bill told him they were Polly’s, but he\r\nwould not believe her, and they laughed over it for some time. Later\r\non, however, she became serious and asked him some questions about the\r\nHarborough lawsuit. Of late Jack had become somewhat intimate with\r\nGilchrist; Bill had gathered this from Bella’s talk, and thinking that,\r\nif anyone could tell her of the present condition of the Harborough\r\ncase, Jack could, she questioned him on it.\r\n\r\n“Why, Lady of Law,” he exclaimed when he found out how much she knew of\r\nthe original claim, “you seem to know a good deal about it already!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I heard all about that part,” she told him; and he remembered\r\nthat Gilchrist had been very often to Haylands during the summer, so\r\noften that he had once thought there was some sort of an understanding\r\nbetween Bill and the Australian, though latterly he had begun to doubt\r\nit. “I am afraid,” he said, thinking her interest in the case was on\r\nGilchrist’s account, “I am afraid your friend won’t get this affair\r\nsettled in a hurry; there seem to be a hundred and one things to prove.”\r\n\r\n“Yes? What? Tell me.”\r\n\r\nHe smiled at her earnestness. “Let me see,” he said, “what shall I tell\r\nyou? I have heard about it no end of times, but I am not so very much\r\nthe wiser and I’m sure you won’t be; still here goes. The lawyers now,\r\nI believe, are busy trying to find out whether this precious rule of\r\nthe youngest son inheriting applies to sons only, or whether it can be\r\nextended to other relations when the sons give out.”\r\n\r\n“Can’t it? I should have thought it could.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, but you’re not a lawyer; lawyers don’t think, they prove. They\r\nsay sometimes the extension is allowed and sometimes it is not,\r\naccording to early arrangement or tradition or something; they have\r\ngot to find out how the first Harborough had his affairs arranged.\r\nThen another question they are busy about is how much old Harborough\r\nknew of the existence of another claimant, and I don’t see how they\r\nare ever to discover that under the circumstances. Things are rather\r\nmixed altogether; for instance, your friend’s father was born in 1845,\r\nold Harborough came into the property that same year, and that year\r\nalso there died his youngest brother, the one who should have had\r\nthe property,--that is what I call indecently crowding events to no\r\npurpose. Then the old man’s will seems likely to prove another bone of\r\ncontention,--whether he had a right to make a will, why he made it,\r\nwhether he believed his position insecure and made it to strengthen\r\nit, or whether he thought it secure and made it in good faith,--oh,\r\nit is a lovely tangle I can tell you! Harborough has talked to me\r\nabout it till I have completely forgotten which party wants to prove\r\nwhat, and have got so mixed myself that I have gone home deciding to\r\nsow estates-tail in the home-field, drain the pond and turn it into an\r\nestate in fee simple to settle on my bonny bride.”\r\n\r\nHe drew Bella’s hand into his own as he spoke, and it was easy to\r\nsee from their faces that there would be no more discussion of the\r\nHarborough case for the present. But Bill could not forbear asking one\r\nlast question: “I suppose it will take a long time to settle?”\r\n\r\n“Years! You’ll have time to grow up twice over before they are done\r\nsquabbling, and Bella will be a staid and sober matron by the time the\r\ndecision is given.”\r\n\r\nBella combated this opinion, not because she doubted the length of the\r\nHarborough lawsuit but because she vowed she would never be staid and\r\nsober. A conversation natural to the circumstances ensued, and lasted\r\nuntil Jack and Bella left the house together.\r\n\r\nIt was of course quite out of the question for both Bill and Polly to\r\nattend Bella’s wedding, as they could not leave the house to take care\r\nof itself, so it had been arranged for Bill to stay and Polly to go. It\r\nwas really important that she should be present at the function, if for\r\nno other reason than her own belief that Bella and Theresa would not\r\nbe equal to the situation and the Dawson family in its strength. “They\r\nwould never manage without me,” Polly said with conviction. “I shall go\r\ndown a day or two beforehand,--I really must, to see after things. You\r\ncan do here quite as well as I can, and no one need know you are alone;\r\nI am not afraid to trust you, as I know you can take very good care of\r\nyourself and the house.”\r\n\r\nTo this Bill agreed. “Of course I shall be all right,” she said. “You\r\nhad better stay as long as Bella and Theresa want you.”\r\n\r\nBut Polly had decided not to remain after the wedding. “There will be\r\nno need for me to do that,” she said. “I shall go several days before\r\nto see that everything is arranged properly and I shall come back\r\ndirectly after. Or,--no, on second thoughts, I think it had better\r\nbe the day after; it would perhaps be nicer if I waited till the day\r\nafter, as there will be such a lot of clearing up to do.”\r\n\r\nBill heard this last decision with a smile, she knew that Polly’s\r\n“clearing up” would mean a substantial hamper-shaped addition to her\r\nluggage. But she said nothing, as she knew Theresa would not mind,\r\nand Polly fulfilled her plan exactly. She went to Wrugglesby three\r\ndays before the wedding with the most wonderful costume that even her\r\ningenuity had ever compassed, safely packed in a cardboard box and\r\nplaced on the seat beside her.\r\n\r\nPolly’s work, and she certainly did work during those three days,\r\nwas not in vain. Bella’s wedding was in every way successful. The\r\nDawson family was properly impressed with the desirability of the\r\nnew connection; Mrs. Dawson was almost satisfied, and Miss Gladys\r\nDawson charmingly (and unpleasantly) put in her place by the presiding\r\ngenius. Polly really was in her element that day and showed to the best\r\nadvantage. Mrs. Stevens was warm in her praises, and even Gilchrist\r\nHarborough, who was there more as the bridegroom’s friend than the\r\nbride’s, thought that his former opinion of Miss Hains had been unjust.\r\n\r\n“It really was as nice a wedding as I have ever seen,” was Miss Gruet’s\r\nopinion, and in the main Ashelton agreed with her, finding in the event\r\na delightful subject of conversation during the lengthening days.\r\n\r\n“It is quite _the_ event of the spring,” Miss Minchin said gaily. So it\r\nwas in Ashelton, and beyond Ashelton the ladies did not take very much\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nBeyond Ashelton, at the little house at Bayswater, there was another\r\nevent, and one of such interest to those concerned that even Polly\r\nfor a time regarded Bella’s wedding as of secondary importance. Mr.\r\nStevens had examined the contents of Bill’s box and found that the deed\r\ndated 1799 was indeed the counterpart of the lease granted by Roger\r\nCorby in the year that Peter Harborough was shot. Mr. Dane, acting\r\nupon this information, had been to a certain old established firm of\r\nsolicitors in London and had seen the senior partner. He was not the\r\nman who, something more than forty years ago, had helped to cut the\r\nbond Wilhelmina Corby had tried to break for herself; nevertheless\r\nhe soon knew all about it, for it was recorded in the annals of the\r\nfirm and only needed to be looked up. Looked up it accordingly was,\r\ntogether with other events, dates, and certificates; and the lease and\r\nthe information and everything else there was to place were placed in\r\nthe hands of this lawyer who, at Mr. Dane’s request, undertook the case\r\nMr. Stevens had refused. Altogether, what with one thing and another,\r\nthings were progressing surprisingly well, and Polly and Bill had good\r\nreason to congratulate themselves.\r\n\r\nBefore the spring was over Mr. Briant of Sandover felt the consequences\r\nof the energy and inquiry Bill had provoked, for he received the most\r\nunwelcome intelligence that a descendant of the Corbys existed and\r\nclaimed, in a purely legal and formal manner, a large piece of his\r\nvaluable Sandover estate. He did not believe the claim genuine; and\r\nthen he did not believe it could be substantiated; and in any case he\r\nwas, if possible, going to contest it, for he had always believed there\r\nwere no legitimate descendants of the Corbys left.\r\n\r\n“It rains lawsuits,” he grumbled once; “before Kit Harborough is\r\nthrough with his trouble I am let in for one. Although,” so he added to\r\na friend, “between you and me, I should be glad to see the boy clear of\r\nhis business half as well as I shall be of Mary Ann Hains, guardian of\r\nsomebody Corby’s granddaughter.”"

      "content": "POLLY PROVES A TRUE PROPHET.\r\n\nIt was in June that the accident happened, early June, but the season\r\nwas warm that year and already the little white roses were in bloom.\r\nThey were in bloom the year of Theresa’s marriage,--white roses for the\r\nwedding, and now, with but one other June to intervene, white roses for\r\nthe burying. It was Bill who thought of this, not Theresa, although\r\nTheresa, smelling the scent of the flowers under the window, thought of\r\nher wedding-day as she sat waiting that night.\r\n\r\nShe shivered a little as she recollected; it may have been at her\r\nthoughts, it may have been with cold, for the air was chilly. It was\r\nvery late; she rose, and going to the window closed it, shutting out the\r\nsweet scents of the night. Then she glanced at the clock,--how late\r\nit was!--past twelve,--Robert had never been so late before. Surely\r\nnothing could have happened to him? Nothing ever happened; he was late,\r\nthat was all, and she sat down again with a set look on her face.\r\n\r\nThere was a letter in her work-basket; she had read it once, but\r\nsomething made her put her sewing down and take it from its envelope\r\nto read again. It was from Bella, who had gone to spend a few days\r\nwith some relations of her husband’s at Kensington. How happy Bella\r\nseemed! How delighted that Jack was going to join her that day! It was\r\nsuch a pleasant letter, though it told little. Theresa read it and\r\nfolded it, smiling as she did so; then for a moment she sat listening,\r\nthinking she heard the sound of a horse’s feet. The road was not\r\nnear, but the night was so still that she could almost have heard in\r\nher present state of tension. She might be mistaken, but there was\r\ncertainly a sound of some kind. Wheels,--someone driving home--then\r\nshe was mistaken, for Robert was riding to-night; this must be some\r\nother wayfarer, perhaps Gilchrist Harborough come down by the mail from\r\nLondon. She set herself to watch again; the sound of the wheels had\r\npassed now, the vehicle may have driven out of earshot, or it may have\r\npaused by the gate where the road was dark. The last must have been the\r\ncase for, after a moment, she caught the sound again; perhaps the horse\r\nstarted suddenly, for the noise was much plainer now. It was coming\r\nnearer--surely there was not some one driving up to the house?\r\n\r\nShe rose quickly, a nameless dread at her heart, and went into the\r\nhall. There she paused a moment listening; the noise of wheels came\r\nnearer, then ceased, and through the closed door she heard, or her\r\nover-wrought senses told her she heard, the sound of a horse breathing.\r\nA man came up the steps; she heard him as she stood there, her hand\r\nupon the door, nerving herself to meet she knew not what. He stopped,\r\nand she opened the door to find herself face to face with Gilchrist\r\nHarborough.\r\n\r\nFor a second he shrank from her, and in the starlight she saw it.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” she asked with lips that seemed too dry to speak.\r\n\r\n“Robert has been hurt,” he answered, avoiding her eyes. “I--I have\r\nbrought him home.”\r\n\r\n“Hurt?”\r\n\r\nHer voice rang distinct, almost sharp, and Harborough knew the question\r\nshe was asking herself, although she was too loyal to put it to him.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he answered, meeting her eyes now; “he has been hurt, badly\r\nhurt, I am afraid.”\r\n\r\n“Badly? How badly?” Fear was whitening her face and quickening her\r\nperceptions. “You don’t mean--oh Robert!--Why, I can see him out there!\r\nRobert!”\r\n\r\nShe passed Harborough and would have gone down the steps but he stopped\r\nher. “That is Dr. Bolton,” he said gently; “I brought him with me.\r\nRobert is there,--but,--you can’t see him.”\r\n\r\nShe leaned against the door-post and caught her breath, searching his\r\nface with questioning eyes. “He is dead?”\r\n\r\nHe felt the words were spoken, though he hardly heard them. “Come in\r\nhere,” he said gently. He led her to the room she had just left, and\r\nput her unresisting in a chair.\r\n\r\n“Dead,” she whispered, “dead?” Her breath was coming in gasps; she\r\nshook a little, but she did not weep or faint. For some reason\r\nGilchrist was afraid to look at her; he moved to the door. “Are you\r\ngoing to bring him in?” she asked in that same low, breathless voice.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Up-stairs?”\r\n\r\n“It would be better.” That was the doctor’s voice outside; both the\r\ndoors were open and he had heard what was said.\r\n\r\n“You will want a light; there is none in the room.”\r\n\r\nShe had risen as she spoke, but the doctor, seeing her white strained\r\nface, said: “No, no, wait here; Harborough will go up first, and set a\r\nlight.”\r\n\r\nShe paid no heed to him, but tried to light a little hand-lamp.\r\nGilchrist took the matches from her trembling fingers and, lighting it\r\nfor her, put it into her hand. She gave him a look of thanks and then\r\nwent slowly up-stairs.\r\n\r\nIt was early the next morning when Bill received the telegram that\r\nsummoned her to Ashelton. That Bill should be summoned both annoyed and\r\nsurprised Polly; she objected to parting with her for one reason, and\r\nfor another she considered that she herself was the right person to be\r\nsent for in an emergency. “I don’t see what good you can do,” she said.\r\n\r\nBut Bill did not argue the point; she looked at the time-table, and\r\nthen went up-stairs to dress for the journey. Polly picked up the\r\ntelegram and having read it again followed Bill. “‘Come at once, Mrs.\r\nMorton wants you. Harborough.’” She read the message aloud to Bill when\r\nshe reached her room. “What has Gilchrist got to do with it, I should\r\nlike to know?”\r\n\r\n“Robert is ill, I expect,” Bill said. “If it were Theresa, Robert would\r\nhave sent the telegram; but as neither of them did, I expect Robert is\r\nill.”\r\n\r\n“Robert ill!” Polly sniffed contemptuously, then with the air of a\r\nprophet who sees his evil prognostications fulfilled, she added: “It is\r\nvery likely you are right; he never was much good. Still I don’t see\r\nwhy Gilchrist Harborough should telegraph for you; he has no connection\r\nwith the matter, neither have you.”\r\n\r\n“Jack and Bella are away. I expect Gilchrist is looking after things;\r\nhe would be very good in an emergency.”\r\n\r\nBill got her dress out of the cupboard as she spoke, and Polly looked\r\nat the telegram again. “Robert’s not ill,” she said with sudden\r\nconviction; “he’s dead!” Bill, from the wording of the telegram,\r\nthought it just possible too; still she did not say so, and Polly went\r\non: “I always said he would die young and die suddenly; now he has done\r\nit and probably left Theresa very badly off.”\r\n\r\nBill was used to seeing Polly in moral undress by this time; the elder\r\ncousin did not always think it necessary to keep up appearances with\r\nthe younger now that she knew how little the girl appreciated or was\r\ndeceived by them. Bill had so often been treated to Polly’s unvarnished\r\nopinion of late that she was not much surprised by her way of regarding\r\nthe possible death of Theresa’s husband.\r\n\r\n“Really I never saw anyone so unlucky as we are,” Polly was saying;\r\n“no sooner do we get Bella settled than we have Theresa thrown back\r\non our hands. It is hard, just as we are beginning to get on a little\r\ntoo, and make things pay. You and I have worked things up and managed\r\nsplendidly, and this is our reward! It seems to me that, manage as we\r\nmay, we shall never reap any benefit from it. We can work and it seems\r\nwe always may. As for those Warings, I have no patience with them!”\r\n\r\n“So it seems, since you won’t wait to hear how Robert is before\r\ndeciding not only his death, but his widow’s future as well.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I know he is dead,” Polly said irritably as she followed the\r\nyounger girl down-stairs. And Bill felt nearly sure of it too, even\r\nbefore she got to Wrugglesby station and saw Sam, who had been sent to\r\nmeet her. When she saw him there was room for doubt no longer.\r\n\r\nOn the homeward drive he told her all he knew about the accident. The\r\nmaster had gone to Wrugglesby yesterday and returned late; he was\r\nriding a skittish young horse and must have been thrown and probably\r\nkilled on the spot. Mr. Harborough, who had come from London by the\r\nmail-train, drove home along the same road and found him, but it was\r\nthought he must have been lying there for several hours. Dr. Bolton had\r\nbeen called up and came with Mr. Harborough to Haylands; but it was\r\nquite useless, the master was beyond help when he was found; “and the\r\nmissus”--so Sam concluded--“was somethin’ terrible, quite stunned, not\r\nsheddin’ so much as a tear.”\r\n\r\nBill could believe that; it seemed to her quite natural that Theresa\r\nshould be stunned. But when she reached Haylands it seemed just as\r\nnatural that Theresa, when she met her and put her arms round her,\r\nshould burst into a paroxysm of weeping. Bill wept with her of course;\r\nit was her nature; but she wept for the pity of life’s tangle, while\r\nTheresa wept for the husband dead last night and the lover dead months\r\nago, for the widowhood of name which had fallen upon her now and the\r\nwidowhood of heart which had fallen long before; wept for her grief and\r\nher loss and her double grief that the loss and grief were not greater,\r\nand for all combined till thought was vague and her heart was eased.\r\n\r\nSo she wept, and no longer dreaded that the world, seeing her grief,\r\nshould also see that which lay behind. She had feared lest the secret\r\nshe had guarded during Robert’s life should be revealed after his\r\ndeath. It was for this reason she would not have Polly or Bella or\r\nanyone but Bill,--Bill whose eyes were not quick to mark anything\r\namiss. The others might discover or think, but Bill--no one minded\r\nBill. And then, when Bill came with her sympathy and her pliant\r\nchanging nature, there suddenly seemed no secret to hide, nothing amiss\r\nwhich could be marked--all was melted in a gush of tears.\r\n\r\nThus Theresa became widow indeed, and though she sorrowed as such she\r\nwas all the better for the sorrowing. Quite unconsciously she turned to\r\nthe girl, whom she still persisted in regarding as a child, for comfort\r\nand help. Bill gave all the comfort she could, listened when Theresa\r\ntold her how Robert went out yesterday and she had not said good-bye;\r\nwept when Theresa wept over this omission and over the hundred trifles\r\nwhich seemed to speak of his presence still near,--his pipe on the\r\nmantelpiece, his whip behind the door, his dog waiting wistfully in the\r\nhall. Bill listened, but she also worked, for that suited her best.\r\nTheresa was really prostrate with grief; so Bill assumed, by the quiet\r\nright of the one who can, the management of the household, and the\r\nmanagement so assumed remained with her some time.\r\n\r\nIt was during the days which followed that Gilchrist Harborough found\r\nhimself thinking that Bill, viewed in a light other than that of\r\nprospective wife, had something to recommend her. He had not seen her\r\nsince the December day when she cancelled their engagement; but in the\r\ntime that followed Robert’s death he saw her often, for she stayed at\r\nAshelton till the summer was well advanced. Polly wanted her back in\r\ntown, but she was obliged to allow that Theresa needed her more at\r\nHaylands. Very reluctantly she gave permission for Bill to remain; very\r\nreluctantly, with the wages Bill forfeited by absence, she hired a girl\r\nto help with the work. And Bill spent a second June at Haylands, very\r\nunlike the first, excepting only that she saw Gilchrist Harborough\r\noften, though even in seeing him there was one great and essential\r\ndifference, for they met now on a new footing, a footing much nearer\r\nequality.\r\n\r\nJack was a good brother-in-law, but Greys was some way from Haylands,\r\nand he, being but recently married, and having besides a great deal\r\nof land to look after, found it somewhat difficult to give Theresa’s\r\nfarm the supervision it required. Harborough lived much nearer, had\r\nmore time and possibly more inclination, for the lawsuit did not\r\noccupy so much of his attention just now, therefore he came often to\r\nHaylands that summer, and in coming, met Bill often, but always in her\r\nworking capacity; a capacity, he thought, which suited her so well\r\nthat he wondered how he had ever come to think of her,--the most able\r\ncollaborator man could wish,--as wife.\r\n\r\nBut Theresa’s domestic arrangement, admirable as she found it, did\r\nnot suit Polly at all. To begin with she did not find the girl at all\r\nan efficient substitute for Bill, and to go on with she “wanted to\r\nknow how it was all going to end.” Bill also wanted to know that, not\r\nbecause she found the arrangement any less pleasant than did Theresa,\r\nbut because it was her custom to plan several miles in advance of the\r\nelder cousin’s range of vision. So, before Theresa had contemplated the\r\nfuture as a working possibility, Bill had answered Polly’s enquiries.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid,” so she wrote, “things are not much better than you\r\nexpected; Theresa will be left very badly off. Still, I think she will\r\nmost likely have a little, so there is a certain amount of choice as to\r\nwhat is to be done; I have not properly talked it over with her so I do\r\nnot know if she has any wishes. As far as I can see we three (she and\r\nyou and I) must live together; we can’t afford two houses, but together\r\nI believe we might live here or in town. If we stop here we should have\r\nto give up most of the land, only keeping enough for a certain amount\r\nof dairy work. The dairy, with pigs, poultry, and vegetable growing, I\r\nreckon would keep us in food and pretty well pay the rent--I believe\r\nthis could be made to answer. We could have a boarder in the summer if\r\nyou liked. Of course the other choice is for you and me to go on as\r\nbefore and take Theresa in; I don’t know what else can be done, unless\r\nshe goes to Jack and Bella, which seems hardly fair.”\r\n\r\nPolly read this letter and digested it thoughtfully, and her thoughts,\r\nit is to be feared, were not so much for the common good as for her\r\nown personal comfort, and that did not incline her towards going to\r\nAshelton. She preferred town to country; she liked her present life in\r\nmany respects, and she certainly did not relish the idea of making pigs\r\nand poultry pay with Bill’s assistance, not because she thought they\r\nwould not pay but because she knew quite well that the assistance would\r\nbe on the wrong side in such a venture. Theresa she did not consider\r\nin the matter, and fortunately for her, Theresa had no very strong\r\nwishes; she did not greatly care whether she remained at Haylands or\r\nwent to London; it seemed to her that her life had been snapped and\r\ncould go on as well, or as ill, in one place as another. Jack was in\r\nfavour of giving up the farm, pronouncing Bill’s scheme to be a mad\r\none. Gilchrist, who knew Bill better, was not so sure of that; but he\r\nsaw that it would entail much hard work on all, on Theresa, who in his\r\nopinion was not fit for it, as well as on Bill who was. Therefore, as\r\nthe general voice was with Polly, she carried the day, to her own great\r\nsatisfaction, and at Michaelmas the farm was given up.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that Bill remained undisturbed at Haylands all\r\nthe summer. She was merely keeping Theresa company, and when Bella’s\r\nhusband spared her to do that for a time, Bill, very reluctantly,\r\nreturned to town, to Polly and her domestic difficulties. It is hard,\r\nwhen one can do work and has half done it, that it should be taken away\r\nand given to another, who not only cannot do it but does not recognise\r\nthat it exists to be done. Bill did not want her work recognised, but\r\nshe did want to finish it; but since that was impossible there was no\r\nchoice but to silently resign it half-finished, without a hope of its\r\nbeing anything but wasted by the one who came after. So she went back\r\nto town, and Bella, it is to be feared, fulfilled her anticipations;\r\nthe seed plants died, the vegetables languished, the ducks laid away,\r\nand the poultry intermarried disastrously. Later on Polly went down\r\nto Haylands, for a rest, she said; and Bill did not ask her to look\r\nafter any of her pet projects, thinking perhaps that it would only be\r\nuseless. When Polly returned she did enquire how the fruit was that\r\nyear, and was told that the trees were breaking with the weight of\r\nplums.\r\n\r\n“Does no one pick them?” Bill asked.\r\n\r\n“Some of them,” Polly told her; “but fruit fetches so little this year;\r\nit is not worth a man’s time to pick it, at least so Gilchrist says,\r\nand he is managing everything, you know.”\r\n\r\nBill was not thinking of Gilchrist’s management but of private\r\nenterprise; Polly was thinking of something quite different and it\r\nwas she who spoke first. “Did it strike you, Bill,” she said, “that\r\nGilchrist takes a great interest in Theresa and her affairs?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, of course; he likes managing, and he does it thoroughly.”\r\n\r\nBut this was not what Polly meant at all and she said so. “What I want\r\nto know,” she concluded, “is, why did he begin it? Why does he do it?”\r\n\r\n“Because it wanted doing, and because he can do it. Somehow or other\r\nthe people who can do things always have to do them whether it is their\r\nbusiness or not; they have a sort of right to the jobs that want doing.”\r\n\r\nThis was not Polly’s opinion. “It’s my belief,” she said, “that he has\r\nan interest in what he does.”\r\n\r\n“An interest? He does not get the profits.”\r\n\r\n“No,” Polly retorted impatiently, “but Theresa does; that’s his\r\ninterest.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean he is fond of Theresa?” Bill asked in astonishment.\r\n\r\nPolly did, and explained herself at some length, without convincing\r\nBill who, when she had come to the conclusion that this was only one of\r\nPolly’s fancies, went back to the subject of the plums. Polly was not\r\ninterested in plums, and when Bill asked if she and Theresa picked any,\r\nanswered snappishly, “No, we did not; we did not choose to spend our\r\ndays up ladders.”\r\n\r\nA recollection of last year lent viciousness to this remark; Bill\r\nremembered last year too and sighed. Had she been at Ashelton\r\nearly enough very likely there would have been a repetition of the\r\nplum-selling. But she was not there in time to do anything, for, though\r\nshe did go down to Haylands to help Theresa to pack at the last, the\r\nfruit was practically over. It was a bad year for apples; there were\r\nhardly any in the orchard at Haylands, and Bill saw at once, when she\r\nwent to look round, that there was nothing to be done with them. As for\r\nthe plums, they were a real grief to her when she saw them lying rotten\r\non the grass beside the branches which the heavy fruit had broken down.\r\n\r\n“Gilchrist could not look after everything,” she told herself, “and\r\nTheresa would not know.”\r\n\r\nAfter all, the waste of the plums did not trouble her so much\r\nas did the sight of the withered plants in the garden, and the\r\nraspberry-canes, still loaded with shrivelled fruit, dried up for want\r\nof water. But bad as the garden was, it was not the worst, for in one\r\nshort tour of the stackyard she found, besides the feathers of many\r\nuntimely victims of stray cats, five lots of addled eggs laid and lost\r\nin the summer months. She had her last find of eggs in a basket on the\r\nSaturday afternoon when she went to the orchard to look for fallen\r\napples. There were not many, but she picked up what there were and took\r\nthe eggs to the ditch to throw them away to make room for the apples.\r\n\r\nIt was just then that Mr. Stevens came by. He was a busy man, but he\r\nsometimes allowed himself a little holiday on Saturdays in September to\r\nshoot a friend’s partridges; he had been shooting partridges that day\r\nand very good sport he had had to judge from the beaming good-humour\r\nhe was carrying back to Wrugglesby.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw Bill he pulled up. “Good-afternoon,” he cried; “I didn’t\r\nknow you were back. You haven’t been over to see me; don’t you want to\r\nhave a talk about your affairs?”\r\n\r\nBill came to the gate. “There isn’t much to say about them, is there?”\r\nshe asked. “I thought nothing much could be done at this time of year.”\r\n\r\n“Well, no, not much certainly; everybody is out of town now. Still, if\r\nyou’d like to have a chat, you might look in when you’re in Wrugglesby;\r\nI’m not very busy just now.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, I will if I have time; I am only here for a few days just\r\nto help Theresa to pack.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, of course, she is leaving soon, poor thing. Going to live in\r\nLondon with you, isn’t she?”\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens felt very sorry for Theresa, of whose affairs he knew all\r\nthat was commonly reported and a little more besides. He felt sorry for\r\nBill, too, that afternoon; she did not seem to be so cheerfully and\r\ncompletely satisfied with life as usual.\r\n\r\n“We must make the best of a bad job,” he said encouragingly, “and look\r\nfor better times. Let’s hope your business will be through before\r\nChristmas,” and he shook his reins as if he were going on.\r\n\r\n“Do you think it could be done so soon as that?” Bill asked with\r\nanimation.\r\n\r\n“I dare say; I don’t see why not, or at the latest early in the\r\nnew year. Woa, my beauty!” and he pulled up again. “Mr. Briant\r\nis a rich man and can afford to fight as a poorer could not; but\r\nyou’re too strong for him, and since the business of the divorce and\r\nremarriage was settled he knows it. It’s my belief--though as I’m not\r\nprofessionally connected with the case perhaps you will say I have no\r\nright to an opinion--it’s my belief Briant never suspected a second\r\nmarriage. But owing to the rector’s help you have incontestable proofs,\r\nand the other side haven’t a case worth mentioning.”\r\n\r\n“Then you think it will be settled soon?” Bill asked. “I am very glad;\r\nand I am glad, too, that Mr. Briant is so rich that one need not much\r\nmind taking money from him; even if I win he will still have plenty\r\nleft.”\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens, though he was amused by her scruples, assured her that\r\nshe might be quite easy on that score. “He’ll have plenty,” he said,\r\n“plenty, seeing that he has neither son nor daughter to take it after\r\nhim. Bless my soul, he ought to be quite pleased to make provision for\r\na young lady in that way!”\r\n\r\nThe lawyer laughed as he spoke and Bill laughed too. “I am afraid he\r\nwon’t see it in that light,” she said.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid not either. No; I think if you win your case you will have\r\nto thank your good aunt’s care in keeping old bills and letters and\r\nrecipes for herb-tea. That is what will have the most to do with it,\r\nsince she managed to keep with them several of old Roger’s useless\r\ndocuments, and one valuable one. Yes, you will have to thank her for\r\nher care and Mr. Dane for his generosity. Good-bye, and a speedy\r\nsuccess to you.”"

      "title": "CHAPTER XXX.",
      "content": "A RELISH WITH TEA.\r\n\nBella’s baby was born in January, and Theresa went to Greys’ for the\r\nevent. Indeed she went there a good deal before the event, for, if\r\nthe truth must be known, life in London with Bill and Polly was not\r\nentirely successful. Two women who have each had a home of their own\r\ndo not always get on when they come to share one between them. Bella\r\nwrote in November inviting Theresa to come to her, and Polly urged the\r\nacceptance of the invitation with unnecessary warmth. Theresa hesitated\r\na while as to her duty and then finally accepted it and went. “And a\r\ngood thing too,” Polly said frankly.\r\n\r\nShe said this to Bill when they were at tea on the afternoon Theresa\r\nleft. Polly sat at her ease with her feet on the fender and her tea-cup\r\non the hob; she liked this position, and she liked the table drawn\r\non to the hearth-rug so that she could sit between it and the fire.\r\nTheresa did not approve of such things; she did not exactly say so, but\r\nshe looked it, and when she set the tea-things she never pulled the\r\ntable up.\r\n\r\n“It’s all very well, Bill,” Polly went on to say. “Theresa may be a\r\nvery nice person,--I dare say she is, but she does not do here, and if\r\nshe is going to live here she will have to alter a good deal.”\r\n\r\n“She will settle down in time.”\r\n\r\nPolly had her doubts about that and expressed them; she also expressed\r\na hope that Theresa would stay with Bella while the settling process\r\nwent on. “The longer she stays there the better,” she concluded.\r\n“Perhaps if she is there long enough and Gilchrist Harborough sees her\r\noften enough, he may marry her and take her to Wood Hall where she\r\ncould be as elegant as she pleased without interfering with me.”\r\n\r\nBill laughed. “You are in rather a hurry,” she observed. “Theresa has\r\nonly been a widow six months, and Gilchrist has not by any means got\r\nWood Hall yet. You finish things off rather too quickly.”\r\n\r\n“I wish somebody else would,” and Polly turned up her gown to preserve\r\nit from the fire.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be too hard on T.,” Bill said rather sadly. “I don’t believe she\r\nis more particular than she used to be; she always was,--well, you used\r\nto call it ladylike.”\r\n\r\nPolly ignored her own past attitude with regard to Theresa and only\r\nremarked: “I could be ladylike if someone else did the dirty work. I\r\nshould like to be ladylike; but some people can’t have what they wish\r\nin this world; they have to work that others may.”\r\n\r\n“Poor old Polly! I’m so sorry you have had to do the stoves lately.\r\nThat place on my finger is nearly well, and I believe I shall be able\r\nto do them again to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not grumbling about you,” Polly said magnanimously.\r\n\r\n“What is the use of grumbling about anything?” Bill asked. “It may let\r\noff steam, but I believe it rusts the pipes. Don’t let’s talk about\r\nTheresa; let us talk about hats.”\r\n\r\nMillinery was a subject of perennial interest to Polly, but to-night\r\nshe refused to discuss it. “I don’t know anything about hats,” she\r\nsaid; “how should I? I haven’t seen anything but these four walls since\r\nI don’t know when.”\r\n\r\n“Why not go to Regent Street to-morrow afternoon?” Bill suggested. “My\r\nfinger is really quite well, so I can do the work and you have not been\r\nout for ages; take an omnibus to Oxford Circus and go and look at all\r\nthe shops.”\r\n\r\nThis was Polly’s favourite recreation and invariable panacea for\r\ndulness, but she still refused to be cheered. “What is the use?” she\r\nsaid. “I shall only see a hat I want and can’t afford.”\r\n\r\n“You will see some new way of trimming up your old one,” Bill assured\r\nher; and though Polly persisted that she would not go, when the\r\nafternoon came she changed her mind and went.\r\n\r\nIt was during Polly’s absence that the great news came to Bill. Mr.\r\nDane brought it; he had come to town for a few days on business, he\r\nsaid, probably on her business. At all events it was fortunate that\r\nhis coming to town was at this time, for he was able to bring the\r\nnews to Bill in person. Of course Polly received a formal intimation;\r\nPolly always received formal intimations and requests from the lawyers\r\nas did Mr. Dane; she was the guardian of the plaintiff, a person of\r\nimportance, and he was a great factor in the case, more especially as\r\nthe lawyers were his lawyers and the money his money. But Bill was only\r\nthe “infant,” so she was not greatly troubled with intimations and\r\nconsultations; and she, in the first instance, was not the person to be\r\nformally acquainted with the decision of the court. Nevertheless she\r\nwas the person to whom Mr. Dane came, even before Polly had received\r\nher legal information and while that lady was out looking at the\r\nbonnet-shops in Regent Street.\r\n\r\nIt was four o’clock when Mr. Dane came. Bill had no idea of seeing him\r\nwhen she went to answer his knock; and the sight of him standing on the\r\ndoorstep in the November dusk was so unexpected that she forgot in her\r\ndelight to wonder why he had come. She led him to the kitchen, their\r\nliving-room now, and gave him Polly’s shabby old arm-chair. She never\r\nthought of apologising; it was the best she had to offer and so needed\r\nno apology; moreover he was her friend and would expect none.\r\n\r\n“Well, Princess,” he said at last,--at first it had not seemed possible\r\nto speak of his errand--“what do you think brings me here to-day?”\r\n\r\nBill looked at him doubtfully for a moment. “I have something to tell\r\nyou,” he went on, and then her whole face became illuminated with\r\nunderstanding. “Oh, Monseigneur!” she said, clasping her hands with an\r\neagerness begotten half of hope, half of fear.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my child,” he said gently, “yes, you have won. That which Roger\r\nCorby gave as a price for wrong is paid back a hundred fold; and you,\r\nyou little Bill, are an heiress in your own right.”\r\n\r\nBill gave a great gasp. “Thank God,” she said, “it is in time! Thank\r\nGod, thank Him, very, very much!” And there followed a pause; perhaps\r\nshe thanked the God who always seemed so close to her. When she spoke\r\nagain it was in hushed tones. “It seems very wonderful,” she said.\r\n“And,--and I owe it to you!”\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Dane did not think she owed it all to him; perhaps he shared\r\nMr. Stevens’s opinion and thought she was the stuff that wins under any\r\ncircumstances. As for the particular circumstances of this case he set\r\nthem aside, and when she persisted, her voice quivering with emotion\r\nas she recounted all he had done, he still set them aside. “It seems\r\na great thing to do, does it?” he said at last. “Ah, you are young;\r\nthings look different when you are young. I am old and I have lived\r\nmuch and loved much, and outlived much too perhaps, and to me,”--and\r\nhe put a tender hand on the glowing hair--“to me it does not seem such\r\na very great thing to do for the child of my past, the daughter of\r\nconsolation to me.”\r\n\r\nThen she said no more, but she kissed him with tears in her eyes.\r\nAfterwards they talked of this fortune, and what it would mean,\r\nand the debt that Bill thought she owed to the Harboroughs--to\r\nPeter Harborough, shot, to hide whose death the price which was the\r\nfoundation of her fortune had been paid--to Kit Harborough, whose rival\r\nthrough an act of hers had learned the claim that he had made,--and\r\nto the old man, last of the Harboroughs of Gurnett, who slept in the\r\nlittle churchyard among the ferns where Roger Corby lay.\r\n\r\nIt was past five o’clock before Polly returned. Mr. Dane had left only\r\na little while before, and she must have almost passed him at the end\r\nof the street, though, if she did, she failed to recognise him. She\r\ndid not notice anything particularly until she reached her own house,\r\nand was surprised to see there were no lights at any of the windows.\r\nMiss Scrivens, who now occupied the drawing-room, must have fallen\r\nasleep and forgotten to ring for the lamp; and Polly decided with some\r\nsatisfaction that Bill for once had followed her instructions and not\r\ntaken the light until it was rung for. With a gratified feeling at this\r\nunusual display of obedience she let herself in and went up-stairs;\r\nwhile she was up-stairs the drawing-room bell rang sharply and Bill\r\nwent to answer it. She was still attending to the lamp, or the lady,\r\nwhen Polly entered the kitchen and found to her surprise that the\r\ntea-tray was not set.\r\n\r\n“What has the girl been doing?” she muttered as she went to the\r\ndresser. She was reaching up to get a jug from a high hook when there\r\ncame a dancing step behind her and, before she could look round, Bill’s\r\narms were thrown round her neck from behind and Bill’s strong hands\r\ntook hers prisoner.\r\n\r\n“Polly!” she exclaimed, possessing herself of the jug and then twisting\r\nPolly round. “Polly, dear old Polly! It has come at last! You shall\r\nhave the finest hat in all Regent Street even if it’s a salad of roses\r\nwith a cockatoo rampant on the top! You shall have it and we will drive\r\nall the way in a hansom cab to buy it!”\r\n\r\n“Bill! What is the matter with the girl? Bill, put down that jug and\r\ntell me what you mean!”\r\n\r\n“I mean,”--but Bill did not put down the jug, she filled it with milk\r\ninstead--“I am going to get Miss Scrivens’s tea,” she said. “I ought to\r\nhave got it before only I have been hindered this afternoon, and I’m\r\ncrazy I think. But, oh, Polly! I’ve got it, got it at last; the money I\r\nmean, or at least as good as got it, it is going to be mine. I expect\r\nyou will have to do things and sign things first, but the case is\r\ndecided for us and it is all as good as mine already!”\r\n\r\n“My dear Bill!” Polly was momentarily overwhelmed by the news, then she\r\nrecovered herself and fetched a tin of sardines from the cupboard. “Oh,\r\nwell,” she said, “if that’s the case we can afford to have a relish\r\nwith our tea.”"

      "content": "THE FULFILLING OF THE DREAM.\r\n\nIn the opinion of certain members of the Chancery bar the conclusion\r\nof the Harborough case was disappointing, for from a legal point of\r\nview, there was no conclusion. In spite of all that had been said on\r\nboth sides, all the facts and traditions and curious crooks that had\r\ncome to light, the case was in the end as far from a legal decision as\r\never; it was merely withdrawn. This was the best thing possible for the\r\nlitigants and certainly the wisest; still, it was to be deplored, for\r\na decision would have been interesting. Apart from the legal aspect\r\nthe conclusion could not be regretted; the buying of the claimant\r\nwas undeniably wise, and at the same time almost romantic, for there\r\nwas something of mystery about it. Nobody, not even the Harboroughs,\r\nknew who paid for it. Someone, whose name was not mentioned and who\r\napparently had no personal interest in the case, found the money, which\r\nGilchrist accepted in lieu of his chance of the Gurnett estates, and\r\nfor the consideration of which he duly undertook that neither he nor\r\nhis should ever raise the claim again.\r\n\r\nThus it happened, when the case was well on in its second year, that\r\nall ended and came to nothing, and Kit Harborough found himself very\r\nmuch where he used to expect he would be; but with an addition he did\r\nnot expect in those days,--a certain price to pay for having defended\r\nhis right to be there. Gilchrist had something to pay too, but it\r\ndid not so much matter to him, for he had thought of the costs when\r\nhe bargained for the price of his withdrawal. On the whole he was\r\nsatisfied with the terms; they were not so high as he had tried to get,\r\nbut they were all his chance was worth to him, and all, apparently,\r\nthat the benevolent person unknown was willing to pay.\r\n\r\nThere was one man, in no way connected with the case, who took a keen\r\ninterest in that benevolent person unknown; not so much at the time,\r\nbut a little later. In the light of subsequent events Mr. Stevens chose\r\nto find that individual most interesting. “Unless I am much mistaken,”\r\nhe once said, though wisely in no one’s hearing but his own, “there\r\nis stuff for a good Chancery suit in that buying off of Gilchrist\r\nHarborough. Certain persons have been juggling with the law, or I’m a\r\nDutchman; persons, too, who should have been above suspicion. Mistress\r\nWilhelmina has a deal to answer for, bless her wicked little heart!\r\nI wonder how it was done? I’d give something to know.” But he never\r\ndid know; only, in later years, he used sometimes to doubt if there\r\nhad been much juggling with the law after all; if rather a certain\r\nchildless old man, who was so much richer than most people knew, had\r\nnot chosen secretly to serve a girl in his life instead of benefiting\r\nher after his death. But of this fancy Mr. Stevens never spoke, for he\r\nknew, if it were true, that it was a secret hidden even from the girl\r\nherself, and he, though only a country lawyer, was a man possessed of\r\nthat best wisdom, the knowledge when to keep silent.\r\n\r\nBut all this was long after; at the time when the Harboroughs’ suit\r\nwas concluded no one even suspected who their benefactor might be. The\r\nHarboroughs themselves puzzled over it for some time and then, as is\r\nthe nature of man, turned to the consideration of their own affairs.\r\nThose affairs were identical for both of them in one particular\r\nat least,--the question of Gilchrist’s return to Australia. It was\r\ngenerally understood among those whom it concerned that Gilchrist was\r\ngoing back to Australia; he had said he should go so soon as the case\r\nwas settled, but now when it came to the point he did not seem so sure\r\nabout it. Kit took a most surprising interest in his rival’s departure,\r\nand he noticed his hesitation directly the subject was introduced.\r\nThere was only one occasion when the two Harboroughs spoke of the\r\nmatter, the only occasion on which they met on purely social terms,\r\nthe day they lunched together at Wood Hall. Kit had invited Gilchrist\r\nthere as it were to shake hands after the fight, possibly feeling\r\nit his duty to do so. Gilchrist accepted the invitation, partly for\r\nsimilar reasons, and partly because he had never been inside Wood Hall\r\nand thought he would rather like to see the old house for which he had\r\nbeen fighting; coming with this motive, there is no doubt he also came\r\nprepared to observe critically and to put a market-value on all he saw.\r\n\r\n“I think I have the best of the bargain,” he told Theresa afterwards;\r\n“the place is in bad repair and at the best of times would take a lot\r\nof keeping up. Still, I admit it has a charm of its own, a charm\r\nwhich cannot be bought or exchanged, and would not, I believe, stand a\r\nchange of ownership. If the house were mine, I should do it up, and, I\r\nsuppose, change its nature; since it is his, he will let things remain\r\nas they are; he can’t afford to do anything else, poor beggar! But he\r\nwill keep the charm and a few absurd, inimitable, medieval prejudices\r\nwhich even an enlightened education cannot make us altogether despise.”\r\n\r\nIt is to be feared that Gilchrist was not far from the truth in his\r\nestimate of the poverty likely to reign at Wood Hall. The estate,\r\ncrippled before, could ill afford the money spent in defence of its\r\nowner’s claim to it. Kit knew this, and knew that the Australian was\r\nquick to mark signs of prosperity or decay.\r\n\r\nThe two Harboroughs did not lunch in the big dining-room where Kit\r\nhad sat with Bill on the day that old Mr. Harborough died, but in\r\na smaller, more modern room where neither length of possession nor\r\nshortness of means stood out so plainly. There was little here to\r\nsuggest that evil days had fallen upon the old place, excepting only\r\nthe view from the windows. Gilchrist glanced out once; the pale\r\nFebruary sunlight was wan on the crack in the stone-work of the\r\nterrace, on the unswept leaves of the autumn and the untouched borders\r\nby the wall. Unconsciously he looked towards his host and observed\r\nhim curiously--the well-bred, stoical face, the grave eyes, the\r\nwell-finished hands--the whole man which told so little.\r\n\r\n“Are you going to live here?” he asked suddenly.\r\n\r\n“Probably not.”\r\n\r\nThere was a moment’s silence. Kit was evidently not communicative on\r\nthat subject, and Gilchrist looked out of the window again before\r\ngiving expression to the thoughts in his mind. “Pity the old place\r\nshould go to pieces!” he said at last. “I could have saved it--spoiled\r\nit, perhaps you would have said--still, saved its life after a fashion,\r\nbut you--”\r\n\r\n“I shall probably go abroad for the next twenty years; after which, if\r\nI am not an inveterate wanderer by that time, I shall come home and\r\nthink about getting some bricks and mortar to mend the hole in the\r\nterrace which we can see so well from here.”\r\n\r\nGilchrist laughed, although he was a little annoyed; he had felt\r\nvaguely sorry for Kit and the decline of the house of Harborough. But\r\nKit kept him well at arm’s length, and the house of Harborough was\r\nplainly not his concern, so he withdrew his sympathy from the end he\r\nhad himself hastened, and the subject was pursued no further.\r\n\r\nIt was then that Kit enquired concerning the return to Australia, and\r\nlearned that there was a good deal of uncertainty connected with the\r\ndate of Gilchrist’s departure; indeed, it seemed almost possible that\r\nhe would not leave England at all that year. Kit did not ask why;\r\nhe knew that it was a woman’s will and a woman’s preparations that\r\nruled the time of the Australian’s going. Herein he was quite right,\r\nthough he was not right in thinking that woman Bill Alardy. Bill’s\r\npreparations, like her will, were never long in making; but the woman\r\nfor whom Gilchrist waited was different; who is to hurry a nine months’\r\nwidow, and who make love to the wife of a man whose grave has not long\r\nbeen green?\r\n\r\nBut of this difficulty Kit knew nothing, and since he was very well\r\naware that Bill’s betrothal was of a private nature, he could not make\r\nany remark upon it even had he wished. So he was still unenlightened as\r\nto the name of the woman whose pleasure Gilchrist waited when a little\r\nlater the Australian took his leave.\r\n\r\nKit went to the door with him, stood on the step looking after him even\r\nwhen he was out of sight, stood there until the sound of his horse’s\r\nfeet had died away in the distance. The sun was gone now; ashy clouds\r\nhad crept over the sky, and all the world was still and grey with the\r\nsoft, tired look of endless afternoon. Kit went down the steps and\r\nwalked slowly past the west front of the house; once he glanced up at\r\nthe crooked windows and the sloping, many-peaked roof, but he looked\r\naway again quickly as if the sight hurt him. He reached the end of the\r\nterrace but he did not go back; instead he wandered aimlessly across\r\nthe lawn, down the rose-walk, past the box-edged beds and the yew\r\ntrees once trimly clipped into quaint devices. The devices were lost\r\nnow, the clipping had not been done for many years. Bill had once said\r\nthat, were the trees hers, she would learn to clip them herself rather\r\nthan that they should be left. So she would, too; she would clip the\r\ntrees and weed the paths and save the house from its approaching decay!\r\nGilchrist had said that day he would have saved it; how could he fail\r\nto save it with her for wife? Old Harborough himself had testified that\r\nshe, and such as she, penniless though they might be, alone could save\r\nan exhausted family, a proud, poor, played-out race.\r\n\r\nKit had come to the outskirts of the wood now; he stopped for a moment,\r\nnot from indecision as to which path to follow, but because he wished\r\nto call a halt in his mind and force himself to face the truth. Why\r\nshould he pretend to look upon Bill as the saviour of his family, the\r\nprop of his house? It is true she could have been all that, but it was\r\nalso true that she was something else to him; not prop nor saviour, but\r\nthe only woman the world held. He had been but a boy eighteen months\r\nago when he first looked into her eyes; he had grown to manhood in\r\nthose eighteen months, but it did not matter, the look thrilled him\r\nstill. He had not seen her since that October day when they pledged\r\neach other to duty, but he had not forgotten; he would never forget;\r\nthere are some it is not easy to forget.\r\n\r\nHe had been following the footpath that led from the gardens to the\r\nlittle church, but he turned away before he reached the low boundary\r\nwall and wandered on through the waste of dead bracken till he struck\r\nthe public footpath which gave upon the lane by a swing-gate. There\r\nwas someone standing by the gate, someone with arms resting upon the\r\ntopmost bar, and eyes fixed, not upon the path with its approaching\r\nfigure, but upon the leafless tree-tops of the wood.\r\n\r\nFor half a second Kit paused, a sensation almost of fear at his\r\nheart--how could she be here in the flesh? Then, at a bound he had\r\nreached the gate; flesh or phantom, he must see her, must touch her\r\nhand once again.\r\n\r\n“Bill!”\r\n\r\nHe had put his hand on the hands on the gate. They were warm, living\r\nhands; he held them fast and there was no effort made to draw them\r\naway. She did not start nor cry out; she did not move at all; she only\r\nlooked up at him, silent yet with throbbing breast. So they stood, the\r\ngate between them, for the space of a full minute, and the world seemed\r\nto hold but them alone.\r\n\r\nFrom the main road there came the sound of horse’s feet, steady,\r\nslow-going, some farm-horse on its way to the blacksmith’s in the\r\nvillage. The sound of hoofs recalled to Kit the last time he had heard\r\nit and recalled also the thought of the man who rode away from his\r\nhouse not an hour ago. He dropped the hands he held almost as if they\r\nburnt him.\r\n\r\n“He cannot--shall not have you!” The words were hardly spoken; they\r\nseemed wrung from him against his will.\r\n\r\nThe discarded hands pulled a splinter off the gate. “He,--he doesn’t\r\nwant me”--their owner seemed much interested in the splinter.\r\n\r\n“Not want you? You--”\r\n\r\nThe gate was between them no longer.\r\n\r\nA while later the farm-horse, having been to the blacksmith’s, was\r\nled home by way of the lane; the man who led him saw no one about the\r\nlonely spot; there was no one by the swing-gate or on the footpath\r\ngoing to the church, no one visible at all. In the shelter of the\r\nleafless wood, however, there were two who explained many things. There\r\nwere many things which needed explanation they found,--the mystery of\r\nBill’s freedom, for one, and Kit’s ignorance of it, for another. The\r\nfirst was easy to recount; the second Bill found harder to explain.\r\n\r\n“I could not tell you,” she said at last; “of course I could not tell\r\nyou. Do you know the feeling, the consciousness almost, that you can\r\nhave and get whatever you make up your mind to have? That has been my\r\nfeeling so long; but I was afraid to seek for this; I wanted it to be\r\nthe free gift of God to me; I wanted it an unsought gift, or not at\r\nall. Do you understand what I mean?” And in case he did not, she went\r\non to give another reason. “I have been getting so much lately,” she\r\nsaid, flashing a shy smile at him, “getting and willing and taking that\r\nI think I wanted someone to take me.”\r\n\r\nAnd it is to be presumed that Kit understood the art of taking her,\r\nfor the next explanation did not follow immediately. When it did come\r\nit had reference to Bill’s unexpected appearance at the gate that\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\n“There is no mystery about that,” Bill said. “I came to look at a\r\nhouse at Sales Green. We are thinking of moving in the spring or\r\nearly summer, and we are looking out for a house with a large garden\r\nsomewhere in this part--the garden is for me, the house for Polly, the\r\npart for Theresa who wants to be near Bella. However, the Sales Green\r\nhouse is no good at all; we shall have to look out for another.”\r\n\r\n“Did you come from town to-day?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; Bella met me at Wrugglesby and drove me to look at the house\r\nand then home with her to lunch. Afterwards I started to walk to the\r\nrectory, having promised to go to tea with Mr. Dane; he is going to\r\ndrive me to the station this evening.”\r\n\r\n“You do not seem to have chosen a very direct route to the rectory.”\r\n\r\n“No,” Bill was obliged to admit; “but I thought I would like to go down\r\nthe lane once more and,--and I did not know you were at home.”\r\n\r\nKit showed the utmost satisfaction in having been at home on this\r\noccasion, and they passed on to the next explanation which was of a\r\ndifferent nature and was given by Kit. It had to do with his prospects\r\nand the narrow means he had to offer; the thought of them made him\r\nremember now it was too late that he had but small right to ask her to\r\nshare his lot.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you know?” Bill exclaimed eagerly almost before she had heard\r\nhim out. “Haven’t you heard? I have got money now,--oh, I am so glad!\r\nI thought perhaps Mr. Briant would have told you, but I suppose he\r\nthought you had worries enough of your own.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps this was the case; at all events, as Mr. Briant had not told\r\nthe tale in full, Bill told it now, and with it the name of the unknown\r\nbenefactor who had put an end to the Harborough suit. Possibly she\r\ndid not tell it well, certainly Kit was astonished almost beyond\r\ncomprehension.\r\n\r\n“You?” he said and he stood to look at her. “You did it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” and she stood still too, twisting a dry twig she held. She\r\nsnapped the brown thing nervously. “I’m sorry, Kit,” she said humbly.\r\nShe knew that it is not always easy to receive a favour. “I’m sorry,\r\nbut there did not seem anyone else to settle it, and it had to be done.\r\nI know it is hard to take things from a woman but,--do you mind so very\r\nmuch from me?”\r\n\r\nKit’s throat swelled painfully. After all, he was very much a boy\r\nstill; but he took the favour and the giver of the favour all in one.\r\n\r\nLater, as they went up the forest path together, he asked her what\r\nshe would have done had he not met her at the gate that day. “It is\r\nall very well,” he said, “to say that you have saved Wood Hall for\r\nyourself as well as for me, but supposing I had not met you to-day,\r\nsupposing I had never learned you were free?”\r\n\r\n“Then I should have gone to live in a house with a big garden and grown\r\ntons of cabbages.”\r\n\r\nKit laughed. “But tell me,” he persisted, “would you have never let me\r\nknow?”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. “I made up my mind to tell no one,” she said,\r\n“only Polly assured me that if ever I married I would have to tell\r\nmy husband; for one reason because he might find out if I did not,\r\nfor another because it would be wrong to hide things from him. For\r\nthe first reason I do not care, I would have risked that; but for the\r\nsecond it is different. I am not afraid that you will misunderstand and\r\nit seems a pity to begin with secrets.”\r\n\r\n“Yes;”--Kit had possessed himself of the small strong hand,--“a great\r\npity since we are to have all things in common.”\r\n\r\nAnd so they passed through the silent wood where the shadows lay,\r\nbrown and purple and deepest blue; they followed the wet path still\r\nstudded with the autumn’s funguses, crossed the deep hollows where last\r\nyear’s leaves glowed in the even light, under the old trees, twisted\r\npollards and stately beeches, and so on, up the hill. Once a startled\r\njay flashed from the covert of a thorn-bush low down across their path;\r\nonce a rabbit looked out from among the beech-roots; nothing else\r\nmoved, and in the stillness of a holy world they came to the gardens\r\nand to the house.\r\n\r\nTogether they went by the western front to the great door still open as\r\nKit had left it; together they entered the wide, dim hall. Kit turned\r\nas he stood on the threshold and looked up at the old house. “Not\r\nyours nor mine,” he said, “but ours, sweetheart.”\r\n\r\n * * * * *\r\n\r\nBut the diamond buckles came to Kit Harborough’s wife after all, for\r\nthey were given to her on her wedding-day by one who still called her\r\n“Princess Puck, child of the Lord’s consolation.”\r\n\nTHE END.\r\n\nGLASGOW: PRINTED AT THE UNIVERSITY PRESS BY ROBERT MACLEHOSE AND CO.\r\n\nTRANSCRIBER’S NOTES:\r\n\n Italicized text is surrounded by underscores: _italics_.\r\n\r\n Perceived typographical errors have been corrected.\r\n\r\n Inconsistencies in hyphenation have been standardized.\r\n\r\n Archaic or variant spelling has been retained."
