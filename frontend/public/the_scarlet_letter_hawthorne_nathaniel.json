The first time was\r\nthree or four years since, when I favored the reader—inexcusably, and\r\nfor no earthly reason, that either the indulgent reader or the\r\nintrusive author could imagine—with a description of my way of life\r\nin the deep quietude of an Old Manse. And now—because, beyond my\r\ndeserts, I was happy enough to find a listener or two on the former\r\noccasion—I again seize the public by the button, and talk of my three\r\nyears’ experience in a Custom-House. The example of the famous\r\n“P. P., Clerk of this Parish,” was never more faithfully followed. The\r\ntruth seems to be, however, that, when he casts his leaves forth upon\r\nthe wind, the author addresses, not the many who will fling aside his\r\nvolume, or never take it up, but the few who will understand him,\r\nbetter than most of his schoolmates or lifemates. Some authors,\r\nindeed, do far more than this, and indulge themselves in such\r\nconfidential depths of revelation as could fittingly be addressed,\r\nonly and exclusively, to the one heart and mind of perfect sympathy;\r\nas if the printed book, thrown at large on the wide world, were\r\ncertain to find out the divided segment of the writer’s own nature,\r\nand complete his circle of existence by bringing him into communion\r\nwith it. It is scarcely decorous, however, to speak all, even where we\r\nspeak impersonally. But, as thoughts are frozen and utterance\r\nbenumbed, unless the speaker stand in some true relation with his\r\naudience, it may be pardonable to imagine that a friend, a kind and\r\napprehensive, though not the closest friend, is listening to our talk;\r\nand then, a native reserve being thawed by this genial consciousness,\r\nwe may prate of the circumstances that lie around us, and even of\r\nourself, but still keep the inmost Me behind its veil. To this extent,\r\nand within these limits, an author, methinks, may be autobiographical,\r\nwithout violating either the reader’s rights or his own.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, likewise, that this Custom-House sketch has a certain\r\npropriety, of a kind always recognized in literature, as explaining\r\nhow a large portion of the following pages came into my possession,\r\nand as offering proofs of the authenticity of a narrative therein\r\ncontained. This, in fact,—a desire to put myself in my true position\r\nas editor, or very little more, of the most prolix among the tales\r\nthat make up my volume,—this, and no other, is my true reason for\r\nassuming a personal relation with the public. In accomplishing the\r\nmain purpose, it has appeared allowable, by a few extra touches, to\r\ngive a faint representation of a mode of life not heretofore\r\ndescribed, together with some of the characters that move in it, among\r\nwhom the author happened to make one.\r\n\r\n * * * * *\r\n\r\nIn my native town of Salem, at the head of what, half a century ago,\r\nin the days of old King Derby, was a bustling wharf,—but which is now\r\nburdened with decayed wooden warehouses, and exhibits few or no\r\nsymptoms of commercial life; except, perhaps, a bark or brig, half-way\r\ndown its melancholy length, discharging hides; or, nearer at hand, a\r\nNova Scotia schooner, pitching out her cargo of firewood,—at the\r\nhead, I say, of this dilapidated wharf, which the tide often\r\noverflows, and along which, at the base and in the rear of the row of\r\nbuildings, the track of many languid years is seen in a border of\r\nunthrifty grass,—here, with a view from its front windows adown this\r\nnot very enlivening prospect, and thence across the harbor, stands a\r\nspacious edifice of brick. From the loftiest point of its roof, during\r\nprecisely three and a half hours of each forenoon, floats or droops,\r\nin breeze or calm, the banner of the republic; but with the thirteen\r\nstripes turned vertically, instead of horizontally, and thus\r\nindicating that a civil, and not a military post of Uncle Sam’s\r\ngovernment is here established. Its front is ornamented with a portico\r\nof half a dozen wooden pillars, supporting a balcony, beneath which a\r\nflight of wide granite steps descends towards the street. Over the\r\nentrance hovers an enormous specimen of the American eagle, with\r\noutspread wings, a shield before her breast, and, if I recollect\r\naright, a bunch of intermingled thunderbolts and barbed arrows in each\r\nclaw. With the customary infirmity of temper that characterizes this\r\nunhappy fowl, she appears, by the fierceness of her beak and eye, and\r\nthe general truculency of her attitude, to threaten mischief to the\r\ninoffensive community; and especially to warn all citizens, careful of\r\ntheir safety, against intruding on the premises which she overshadows\r\nwith her wings. Nevertheless, vixenly as she looks, many people are\r\nseeking, at this very moment, to shelter themselves under the wing of\r\nthe federal eagle; imagining, I presume, that her bosom has all the\r\nsoftness and snugness of an eider-down pillow. But she has no great\r\ntenderness, even in her best of moods, and, sooner or later,—oftener\r\nsoon than late,—is apt to fling off her nestlings, with a scratch of\r\nher claw, a dab of her beak, or a rankling wound from her barbed\r\narrows.\r\n\r\nThe pavement round about the above-described edifice—which we may as\r\nwell name at once as the Custom-House of the port—has grass enough\r\ngrowing in its chinks to show that it has not, of late days, been worn\r\nby any multitudinous resort of business. In some months of the year,\r\nhowever, there often chances a forenoon when affairs move onward with\r\na livelier tread. Such occasions might remind the elderly citizen of\r\nthat period before the last war with England, when Salem was a port by\r\nitself; not scorned, as she is now, by her own merchants and\r\nship-owners, who permit her wharves to crumble to ruin, while their\r\nventures go to swell, needlessly and imperceptibly, the mighty flood\r\nof commerce at New York or Boston. On some such morning, when three or\r\nfour vessels happen to have arrived at once,—usually from Africa or\r\nSouth America,—or to be on the verge of their departure thitherward,\r\nthere is a sound of frequent feet, passing briskly up and down the\r\ngranite steps. Here, before his own wife has greeted him, you may\r\ngreet the sea-flushed shipmaster, just in port, with his vessel’s\r\npapers under his arm, in a tarnished tin box. Here, too, comes his\r\nowner, cheerful or sombre, gracious or in the sulks, accordingly as\r\nhis scheme of the now accomplished voyage has been realized in\r\nmerchandise that will readily be turned to gold, or has buried him\r\nunder a bulk of incommodities, such as nobody will care to rid him of.\r\nHere, likewise,—the germ of the wrinkle-browed, grizzly-bearded,\r\ncare-worn merchant,—we have the smart young clerk, who gets the taste\r\nof traffic as a wolf-cub does of blood, and already sends adventures\r\nin his master’s ships, when he had better be sailing mimic-boats upon\r\na mill-pond. Another figure in the scene is the outward-bound sailor\r\nin quest of a protection; or the recently arrived one, pale and\r\nfeeble, seeking a passport to the hospital. Nor must we forget the\r\ncaptains of the rusty little schooners that bring firewood from the\r\nBritish provinces; a rough-looking set of tarpaulins, without the\r\nalertness of the Yankee aspect, but contributing an item of no slight\r\nimportance to our decaying trade.\r\n\r\nCluster all these individuals together, as they sometimes were, with\r\nother miscellaneous ones to diversify the group, and, for the time\r\nbeing, it made the Custom-House a stirring scene. More frequently,\r\nhowever, on ascending the steps, you would discern—in the entry, if\r\nit were summer time, or in their appropriate rooms, if wintry or\r\ninclement weather—a row of venerable figures, sitting in\r\nold-fashioned chairs, which were tipped on their hind legs back\r\nagainst the wall. Oftentimes they were asleep, but occasionally might\r\nbe heard talking together, in voices between speech and a snore, and\r\nwith that lack of energy that distinguishes the occupants of\r\nalmshouses, and all other human beings who depend for subsistence on\r\ncharity, on monopolized labor, or anything else, but their own\r\nindependent exertions. These old gentlemen—seated, like Matthew, at\r\nthe receipt of customs, but not very liable to be summoned thence,\r\nlike him, for apostolic errands—were Custom-House officers.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, on the left hand as you enter the front door, is a\r\ncertain room or office, about fifteen feet square, and of a lofty\r\nheight; with two of its arched windows commanding a view of the\r\naforesaid dilapidated wharf, and the third looking across a narrow\r\nlane, and along a portion of Derby Street. All three give glimpses of\r\nthe shops of grocers, block-makers, slop-sellers, and ship-chandlers;\r\naround the doors of which are generally to be seen, laughing and\r\ngossiping, clusters of old salts, and such other wharf-rats as haunt\r\nthe Wapping of a seaport. The room itself is cobwebbed, and dingy with\r\nold paint; its floor is strewn with gray sand, in a fashion that has\r\nelsewhere fallen into long disuse; and it is easy to conclude, from\r\nthe general slovenliness of the place, that this is a sanctuary into\r\nwhich womankind, with her tools of magic, the broom and mop, has very\r\ninfrequent access. In the way of furniture, there is a stove with a\r\nvoluminous funnel; an old pine desk, with a three-legged stool beside\r\nit; two or three wooden-bottom chairs, exceedingly decrepit and\r\ninfirm; and—not to forget the library—on some shelves, a score or\r\ntwo of volumes of the Acts of Congress, and a bulky Digest of the\r\nRevenue Laws. A tin pipe ascends through the ceiling, and forms a\r\nmedium of vocal communication with other parts of the edifice. And\r\nhere, some six months ago,—pacing from corner to corner, or lounging\r\non the long-legged stool, with his elbow on the desk, and his eyes\r\nwandering up and down the columns of the morning newspaper,—you might\r\nhave recognized, honored reader, the same individual who welcomed you\r\ninto his cheery little study, where the sunshine glimmered so\r\npleasantly through the willow branches, on the western side of the Old\r\nManse. But now, should you go thither to seek him, you would inquire\r\nin vain for the Locofoco Surveyor. The besom of reform has swept him\r\nout of office; and a worthier successor wears his dignity, and pockets\r\nhis emoluments.\r\n\r\nThis old town of Salem—my native place, though I have dwelt much away\r\nfrom it, both in boyhood and maturer years—possesses, or did possess,\r\na hold on my affections, the force of which I have never realized\r\nduring my seasons of actual residence here. Indeed, so far as its\r\nphysical aspect is concerned, with its flat, unvaried surface, covered\r\nchiefly with wooden houses, few or none of which pretend to\r\narchitectural beauty,—its irregularity, which is neither picturesque\r\nnor quaint, but only tame,—its long and lazy street, lounging\r\nwearisomely through the whole extent of the peninsula, with Gallows\r\nHill and New Guinea at one end, and a view of the almshouse at the\r\nother,—such being the features of my native town, it would be quite\r\nas reasonable to form a sentimental attachment to a disarranged\r\nchecker-board. And yet, though invariably happiest elsewhere, there is\r\nwithin me a feeling for old Salem, which, in lack of a better phrase,\r\nI must be content to call affection. The sentiment is probably\r\nassignable to the deep and aged roots which my family has struck into\r\nthe soil. It is now nearly two centuries and a quarter since the\r\noriginal Briton, the earliest emigrant of my name, made his appearance\r\nin the wild and forest-bordered settlement, which has since become a\r\ncity. And here his descendants have been born and died, and have\r\nmingled their earthy substance with the soil; until no small portion\r\nof it must necessarily be akin to the mortal frame wherewith, for a\r\nlittle while, I walk the streets. In part, therefore, the attachment\r\nwhich I speak of is the mere sensuous sympathy of dust for dust. Few\r\nof my countrymen can know what it is; nor, as frequent transplantation\r\nis perhaps better for the stock, need they consider it desirable to\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nBut the sentiment has likewise its moral quality. The figure of that\r\nfirst ancestor, invested by family tradition with a dim and dusky\r\ngrandeur, was present to my boyish imagination, as far back as I can\r\nremember. It still haunts me, and induces a sort of home-feeling with\r\nthe past, which I scarcely claim in reference to the present phase of\r\nthe town. I seem to have a stronger claim to a residence here on\r\naccount of this grave, bearded, sable-cloaked and steeple-crowned\r\nprogenitor,—who came so early, with his Bible and his sword, and\r\ntrode the unworn street with such a stately port, and made so large a\r\nfigure, as a man of war and peace,—a stronger claim than for myself,\r\nwhose name is seldom heard and my face hardly known. He was a soldier,\r\nlegislator, judge; he was a ruler in the Church; he had all the\r\nPuritanic traits, both good and evil. He was likewise a bitter\r\npersecutor, as witness the Quakers, who have remembered him in their\r\nhistories, and relate an incident of his hard severity towards a woman\r\nof their sect, which will last longer, it is to be feared, than any\r\nrecord of his better deeds, although these were many. His son, too,\r\ninherited the persecuting spirit, and made himself so conspicuous in\r\nthe martyrdom of the witches, that their blood may fairly be said to\r\nhave left a stain upon him. So deep a stain, indeed, that his old dry\r\nbones, in the Charter Street burial-ground, must still retain it, if\r\nthey have not crumbled utterly to dust! I know not whether these\r\nancestors of mine bethought themselves to repent, and ask pardon of\r\nHeaven for their cruelties; or whether they are now groaning under the\r\nheavy consequences of them, in another state of being. At all events,\r\nI, the present writer, as their representative, hereby take shame upon\r\nmyself for their sakes, and pray that any curse incurred by them—as I\r\nhave heard, and as the dreary and unprosperous condition of the race,\r\nfor many a long year back, would argue to exist—may be now and\r\nhenceforth removed.\r\n\r\nDoubtless, however, either of these stern and black-browed Puritans\r\nwould have thought it quite a sufficient retribution for his sins,\r\nthat, after so long a lapse of years, the old trunk of the family\r\ntree, with so much venerable moss upon it, should have borne, as its\r\ntopmost bough, an idler like myself. No aim, that I have ever\r\ncherished, would they recognize as laudable; no success of mine—if my\r\nlife, beyond its domestic scope, had ever been brightened by\r\nsuccess—would they deem otherwise than worthless, if not positively\r\ndisgraceful. “What is he?” murmurs one gray shadow of my forefathers\r\nto the other. “A writer of story-books! What kind of a business in\r\nlife—what mode of glorifying God, or being serviceable to mankind in\r\nhis day and generation—may that be? Why, the degenerate fellow might\r\nas well have been a fiddler!” Such are the compliments bandied between\r\nmy great-grandsires and myself, across the gulf of time! And yet, let\r\nthem scorn me as they will, strong traits of their nature have\r\nintertwined themselves with mine.\r\n\r\nPlanted deep, in the town’s earliest infancy and childhood, by these\r\ntwo earnest and energetic men, the race has ever since subsisted here;\r\nalways, too, in respectability; never, so far as I have known,\r\ndisgraced by a single unworthy member; but seldom or never, on the\r\nother hand, after the first two generations, performing any memorable\r\ndeed, or so much as putting forward a claim to public notice.\r\nGradually, they have sunk almost out of sight; as old houses, here and\r\nthere about the streets, get covered half-way to the eaves by the\r\naccumulation of new soil. From father to son, for above a hundred\r\nyears, they followed the sea; a gray-headed shipmaster, in each\r\ngeneration, retiring from the quarter-deck to the homestead, while a\r\nboy of fourteen took the hereditary place before the mast, confronting\r\nthe salt spray and the gale, which had blustered against his sire and\r\ngrandsire. The boy, also, in due time, passed from the forecastle to\r\nthe cabin, spent a tempestuous manhood, and returned from his\r\nworld-wanderings, to grow old, and die, and mingle his dust with the\r\nnatal earth. This long connection of a family with one spot, as its\r\nplace of birth and burial, creates a kindred between the human being\r\nand the locality, quite independent of any charm in the scenery or\r\nmoral circumstances that surround him. It is not love, but instinct.\r\nThe new inhabitant—who came himself from a foreign land, or whose\r\nfather or grandfather came—has little claim to be called a Salemite;\r\nhe has no conception of the oyster-like tenacity with which an old\r\nsettler, over whom his third century is creeping, clings to the spot\r\nwhere his successive generations have been imbedded. It is no matter\r\nthat the place is joyless for him; that he is weary of the old wooden\r\nhouses, the mud and dust, the dead level of site and sentiment, the\r\nchill east wind, and the chillest of social atmospheres;—all these,\r\nand whatever faults besides he may see or imagine, are nothing to the\r\npurpose. The spell survives, and just as powerfully as if the natal\r\nspot were an earthly paradise. So has it been in my case. I felt it\r\nalmost as a destiny to make Salem my home; so that the mould of\r\nfeatures and cast of character which had all along been familiar\r\nhere,—ever, as one representative of the race lay down in his grave,\r\nanother assuming, as it were, his sentry-march along the main\r\nstreet,—might still in my little day be seen and recognized in the\r\nold town. Nevertheless, this very sentiment is an evidence that the\r\nconnection, which has become an unhealthy one, should at last be\r\nsevered. Human nature will not flourish, any more than a potato, if it\r\nbe planted and replanted, for too long a series of generations, in the\r\nsame worn-out soil. My children have had other birthplaces, and, so\r\nfar as their fortunes may be within my control, shall strike their\r\nroots into unaccustomed earth.\r\n\r\nOn emerging from the Old Manse, it was chiefly this strange, indolent,\r\nunjoyous attachment for my native town, that brought me to fill a\r\nplace in Uncle Sam’s brick edifice, when I might as well, or better,\r\nhave gone somewhere else. My doom was on me. It was not the first\r\ntime, nor the second, that I had gone away,—as it seemed,\r\npermanently,—but yet returned, like the bad half-penny; or as if\r\nSalem were for me the inevitable centre of the universe. So, one fine\r\nmorning, I ascended the flight of granite steps, with the President’s\r\ncommission in my pocket, and was introduced to the corps of gentlemen\r\nwho were to aid me in my weighty responsibility, as chief executive\r\nofficer of the Custom-House.\r\n\r\nI doubt greatly—or, rather, I do not doubt at all—whether any public\r\nfunctionary of the United States, either in the civil or military\r\nline, has ever had such a patriarchal body of veterans under his\r\norders as myself. The whereabouts of the Oldest Inhabitant was at once\r\nsettled, when I looked at them. For upwards of twenty years before\r\nthis epoch, the independent position of the Collector had kept the\r\nSalem Custom-House out of the whirlpool of political vicissitude,\r\nwhich makes the tenure of office generally so fragile. A soldier,—New\r\nEngland’s most distinguished soldier,—he stood firmly on the pedestal\r\nof his gallant services; and, himself secure in the wise liberality of\r\nthe successive administrations through which he had held office, he\r\nhad been the safety of his subordinates in many an hour of danger and\r\nheart-quake. General Miller was radically conservative; a man over\r\nwhose kindly nature habit had no slight influence; attaching himself\r\nstrongly to familiar faces, and with difficulty moved to change, even\r\nwhen change might have brought unquestionable improvement. Thus, on\r\ntaking charge of my department, I found few but aged men. They were\r\nancient sea-captains, for the most part, who, after being tost on\r\nevery sea, and standing up sturdily against life’s tempestuous blasts,\r\nhad finally drifted into this quiet nook; where, with little to\r\ndisturb them, except the periodical terrors of a Presidential\r\nelection, they one and all acquired a new lease of existence. Though\r\nby no means less liable than their fellow-men to age and infirmity,\r\nthey had evidently some talisman or other that kept death at bay. Two\r\nor three of their number, as I was assured, being gouty and rheumatic,\r\nor perhaps bedridden, never dreamed of making their appearance at the\r\nCustom-House, during a large part of the year; but, after a torpid\r\nwinter, would creep out into the warm sunshine of May or June, go\r\nlazily about what they termed duty, and, at their own leisure and\r\nconvenience, betake themselves to bed again. I must plead guilty to\r\nthe charge of abbreviating the official breath of more than one of\r\nthese venerable servants of the republic. They were allowed, on my\r\nrepresentation, to rest from their arduous labors, and soon\r\nafterwards—as if their sole principle of life had been zeal for their\r\ncountry’s service, as I verily believe it was—withdrew to a better\r\nworld. It is a pious consolation to me, that, through my interference,\r\na sufficient space was allowed them for repentance of the evil and\r\ncorrupt practices into which, as a matter of course, every\r\nCustom-House officer must be supposed to fall. Neither the front nor\r\nthe back entrance of the Custom-House opens on the road to Paradise.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of my officers were Whigs. It was well for their\r\nvenerable brotherhood that the new Surveyor was not a politician, and\r\nthough a faithful Democrat in principle, neither received nor held his\r\noffice with any reference to political services. Had it been\r\notherwise,—had an active politician been put into this influential\r\npost, to assume the easy task of making head against a Whig Collector,\r\nwhose infirmities withheld him from the personal administration of his\r\noffice,—hardly a man of the old corps would have drawn the breath of\r\nofficial life, within a month after the exterminating angel had come\r\nup the Custom-House steps. According to the received code in such\r\nmatters, it would have been nothing short of duty, in a politician, to\r\nbring every one of those white heads under the axe of the guillotine.\r\nIt was plain enough to discern, that the old fellows dreaded some such\r\ndiscourtesy at my hands. It pained, and at the same time amused me, to\r\nbehold the terrors that attended my advent; to see a furrowed cheek,\r\nweather-beaten by half a century of storm, turn ashy pale at the\r\nglance of so harmless an individual as myself; to detect, as one or\r\nanother addressed me, the tremor of a voice, which, in long-past days,\r\nhad been wont to bellow through a speaking-trumpet, hoarsely enough to\r\nfrighten Boreas himself to silence. They knew, these excellent old\r\npersons, that, by all established rule,—and, as regarded some of\r\nthem, weighed by their own lack of efficiency for business,—they\r\nought to have given place to younger men, more orthodox in politics,\r\nand altogether fitter than themselves to serve our common Uncle. I\r\nknew it too, but could never quite find in my heart to act upon the\r\nknowledge. Much and deservedly to my own discredit, therefore, and\r\nconsiderably to the detriment of my official conscience, they\r\ncontinued, during my incumbency, to creep about the wharves, and\r\nloiter up and down the Custom-House steps. They spent a good deal of\r\ntime, also, asleep in their accustomed corners, with their chairs\r\ntilted back against the wall; awaking, however, once or twice in a\r\nforenoon, to bore one another with the several thousandth repetition\r\nof old sea-stories, and mouldy jokes, that had grown to be passwords\r\nand countersigns among them.\r\n\r\nThe discovery was soon made, I imagine, that the new Surveyor had no\r\ngreat harm in him. So, with lightsome hearts, and the happy\r\nconsciousness of being usefully employed,—in their own behalf, at\r\nleast, if not for our beloved country,—these good old gentlemen went\r\nthrough the various formalities of office. Sagaciously, under their\r\nspectacles, did they peep into the holds of vessels! Mighty was their\r\nfuss about little matters, and marvellous, sometimes, the obtuseness\r\nthat allowed greater ones to slip between their fingers! Whenever such\r\na mischance occurred,—when a wagon-load of valuable merchandise had\r\nbeen smuggled ashore, at noonday, perhaps, and directly beneath their\r\nunsuspicious noses,—nothing could exceed the vigilance and alacrity\r\nwith which they proceeded to lock, and double-lock, and secure with\r\ntape and sealing-wax, all the avenues of the delinquent vessel.\r\nInstead of a reprimand for their previous negligence, the case seemed\r\nrather to require an eulogium on their praiseworthy caution, after the\r\nmischief had happened; a grateful recognition of the promptitude of\r\ntheir zeal, the moment that there was no longer any remedy.\r\n\r\nUnless people are more than commonly disagreeable, it is my foolish\r\nhabit to contract a kindness for them. The better part of my\r\ncompanion’s character, if it have a better part, is that which usually\r\ncomes uppermost in my regard, and forms the type whereby I recognize\r\nthe man. As most of these old Custom-House officers had good traits,\r\nand as my position in reference to them, being paternal and\r\nprotective, was favorable to the growth of friendly sentiments, I soon\r\ngrew to like them all. It was pleasant, in the summer forenoons,—when\r\nthe fervent heat, that almost liquefied the rest of the human family,\r\nmerely communicated a genial warmth to their half-torpid systems,—it\r\nwas pleasant to hear them chatting in the back entry, a row of them\r\nall tipped against the wall, as usual; while the frozen witticisms of\r\npast generations were thawed out, and came bubbling with laughter from\r\ntheir lips. Externally, the jollity of aged men has much in common\r\nwith the mirth of children; the intellect, any more than a deep sense\r\nof humor, has little to do with the matter; it is, with both, a gleam\r\nthat plays upon the surface, and imparts a sunny and cheery aspect\r\nalike to the green branch, and gray, mouldering trunk. In one case,\r\nhowever, it is real sunshine; in the other, it more resembles the\r\nphosphorescent glow of decaying wood.\r\n\r\nIt would be sad injustice, the reader must understand, to represent\r\nall my excellent old friends as in their dotage. In the first place,\r\nmy coadjutors were not invariably old; there were men among them in\r\ntheir strength and prime, of marked ability and energy, and altogether\r\nsuperior to the sluggish and dependent mode of life on which their\r\nevil stars had cast them. Then, moreover, the white locks of age were\r\nsometimes found to be the thatch of an intellectual tenement in good\r\nrepair. But, as respects the majority of my corps of veterans, there\r\nwill be no wrong done, if I characterize them generally as a set of\r\nwearisome old souls, who had gathered nothing worth preservation from\r\ntheir varied experience of life. They seemed to have flung away all\r\nthe golden grain of practical wisdom, which they had enjoyed so many\r\nopportunities of harvesting, and most carefully to have stored their\r\nmemories with the husks. They spoke with far more interest and unction\r\nof their morning’s breakfast, or yesterday’s, to-day’s, or to-morrow’s\r\ndinner, than of the shipwreck of forty or fifty years ago, and all the\r\nworld’s wonders which they had witnessed with their youthful eyes.\r\n\r\nThe father of the Custom-House—the patriarch, not only of this little\r\nsquad of officials, but, I am bold to say, of the respectable body of\r\ntide-waiters all over the United States—was a certain permanent\r\nInspector. He might truly be termed a legitimate son of the revenue\r\nsystem, dyed in the wool, or, rather, born in the purple; since his\r\nsire, a Revolutionary colonel, and formerly collector of the port, had\r\ncreated an office for him, and appointed him to fill it, at a period\r\nof the early ages which few living men can now remember. This\r\nInspector, when I first knew him, was a man of fourscore years, or\r\nthereabouts, and certainly one of the most wonderful specimens of\r\nwinter-green that you would be likely to discover in a lifetime’s\r\nsearch. With his florid cheek, his compact figure, smartly arrayed in\r\na bright-buttoned blue coat, his brisk and vigorous step, and his hale\r\nand hearty aspect, altogether he seemed—not young, indeed—but a kind\r\nof new contrivance of Mother Nature in the shape of man, whom age and\r\ninfirmity had no business to touch. His voice and laugh, which\r\nperpetually re-echoed through the Custom-House, had nothing of the\r\ntremulous quaver and cackle of an old man’s utterance; they came\r\nstrutting out of his lungs, like the crow of a cock, or the blast of a\r\nclarion. Looking at him merely as an animal,—and there was very\r\nlittle else to look at,—he was a most satisfactory object, from the\r\nthorough healthfulness and wholesomeness of his system, and his\r\ncapacity, at that extreme age, to enjoy all, or nearly all, the\r\ndelights which he had ever aimed at, or conceived of. The careless\r\nsecurity of his life in the Custom-House, on a regular income, and\r\nwith but slight and infrequent apprehensions of removal, had no doubt\r\ncontributed to make time pass lightly over him. The original and more\r\npotent causes, however, lay in the rare perfection of his animal\r\nnature, the moderate proportion of intellect, and the very trifling\r\nadmixture of moral and spiritual ingredients; these latter qualities,\r\nindeed, being in barely enough measure to keep the old gentleman from\r\nwalking on all-fours. He possessed no power of thought, no depth of\r\nfeeling, no troublesome sensibilities; nothing, in short, but a few\r\ncommonplace instincts, which, aided by the cheerful temper that grew\r\ninevitably out of his physical well-being, did duty very respectably,\r\nand to general acceptance, in lieu of a heart. He had been the husband\r\nof three wives, all long since dead; the father of twenty children,\r\nmost of whom, at every age of childhood or maturity, had likewise\r\nreturned to dust. Here, one would suppose, might have been sorrow\r\nenough to imbue the sunniest disposition, through and through, with a\r\nsable tinge. Not so with our old Inspector! One brief sigh sufficed to\r\ncarry off the entire burden of these dismal reminiscences. The next\r\nmoment, he was as ready for sport as any unbreeched infant; far\r\nreadier than the Collector’s junior clerk, who, at nineteen years, was\r\nmuch the elder and graver man of the two.\r\n\r\nI used to watch and study this patriarchal personage with, I think,\r\nlivelier curiosity, than any other form of humanity there presented to\r\nmy notice. He was, in truth, a rare phenomenon; so perfect, in one\r\npoint of view; so shallow, so delusive, so impalpable, such an\r\nabsolute nonentity, in every other. My conclusion was that he had no\r\nsoul, no heart, no mind; nothing, as I have already said, but\r\ninstincts: and yet, withal, so cunningly had the few materials of his\r\ncharacter been put together, that there was no painful perception of\r\ndeficiency, but, on my part, an entire contentment with what I found\r\nin him. It might be difficult—and it was so—to conceive how he\r\nshould exist hereafter, so earthly and sensuous did he seem; but\r\nsurely his existence here, admitting that it was to terminate with his\r\nlast breath, had been not unkindly given; with no higher moral\r\nresponsibilities than the beasts of the field, but with a larger scope\r\nof enjoyment than theirs, and with all their blessed immunity from the\r\ndreariness and duskiness of age.\r\n\r\nOne point, in which he had vastly the advantage over his four-footed\r\nbrethren, was his ability to recollect the good dinners which it had\r\nmade no small portion of the happiness of his life to eat. His\r\ngourmandism was a highly agreeable trait; and to hear him talk of\r\nroast-meat was as appetizing as a pickle or an oyster. As he\r\npossessed no higher attribute, and neither sacrificed nor vitiated any\r\nspiritual endowment by devoting all his energies and ingenuities to\r\nsubserve the delight and profit of his maw, it always pleased and\r\nsatisfied me to hear him expatiate on fish, poultry, and butcher’s\r\nmeat, and the most eligible methods of preparing them for the table.\r\nHis reminiscences of good cheer, however ancient the date of the\r\nactual banquet, seemed to bring the savor of pig or turkey under one’s\r\nvery nostrils. There were flavors on his palate that had lingered\r\nthere not less than sixty or seventy years, and were still apparently\r\nas fresh as that of the mutton-chop which he had just devoured for his\r\nbreakfast. I have heard him smack his lips over dinners, every guest\r\nat which, except himself, had long been food for worms. It was\r\nmarvellous to observe how the ghosts of bygone meals were continually\r\nrising up before him; not in anger or retribution, but as if grateful\r\nfor his former appreciation and seeking to resuscitate an endless\r\nseries of enjoyment, at once shadowy and sensual. A tender-loin of\r\nbeef, a hind-quarter of veal, a spare-rib of pork, a particular\r\nchicken, or a remarkably praiseworthy turkey, which had perhaps\r\nadorned his board in the days of the elder Adams, would be remembered;\r\nwhile all the subsequent experience of our race, and all the events\r\nthat brightened or darkened his individual career, had gone over him\r\nwith as little permanent effect as the passing breeze. The chief\r\ntragic event of the old man’s life, so far as I could judge, was his\r\nmishap with a certain goose which lived and died some twenty or forty\r\nyears ago; a goose of most promising figure, but which, at table,\r\nproved so inveterately tough that the carving-knife would make no\r\nimpression on its carcass, and it could only be divided with an axe\r\nand handsaw.\r\n\r\nBut it is time to quit this sketch; on which, however, I should be\r\nglad to dwell at considerably more length because, of all men whom I\r\nhave ever known, this individual was fittest to be a Custom-House\r\nofficer. Most persons, owing to causes which I may not have space to\r\nhint at, suffer moral detriment from this peculiar mode of life. The\r\nold Inspector was incapable of it, and, were he to continue in office\r\nto the end of time, would be just as good as he was then, and sit down\r\nto dinner with just as good an appetite.\r\n\r\nThere is one likeness, without which my gallery of Custom-House\r\nportraits would be strangely incomplete; but which my comparatively\r\nfew opportunities for observation enable me to sketch only in the\r\nmerest outline. It is that of the Collector, our gallant old General,\r\nwho, after his brilliant military service, subsequently to which he\r\nhad ruled over a wild Western territory, had come hither, twenty years\r\nbefore, to spend the decline of his varied and honorable life. The\r\nbrave soldier had already numbered, nearly or quite, his threescore\r\nyears and ten, and was pursuing the remainder of his earthly march,\r\nburdened with infirmities which even the martial music of his own\r\nspirit-stirring recollections could do little towards lightening. The\r\nstep was palsied now that had been foremost in the charge. It was only\r\nwith the assistance of a servant, and by leaning his hand heavily on\r\nthe iron balustrade, that he could slowly and painfully ascend the\r\nCustom-House steps, and, with a toilsome progress across the floor,\r\nattain his customary chair beside the fireplace. There he used to sit,\r\ngazing with a somewhat dim serenity of aspect at the figures that came\r\nand went; amid the rustle of papers, the administering of oaths, the\r\ndiscussion of business, and the casual talk of the office; all which\r\nsounds and circumstances seemed but indistinctly to impress his\r\nsenses, and hardly to make their way into his inner sphere of\r\ncontemplation. His countenance, in this repose, was mild and kindly.\r\nIf his notice was sought, an expression of courtesy and interest\r\ngleamed out upon his features; proving that there was light within\r\nhim, and that it was only the outward medium of the intellectual lamp\r\nthat obstructed the rays in their passage. The closer you penetrated\r\nto the substance of his mind, the sounder it appeared. When no longer\r\ncalled upon to speak, or listen, either of which operations cost him\r\nan evident effort, his face would briefly subside into its former not\r\nuncheerful quietude. It was not painful to behold this look; for,\r\nthough dim, it had not the imbecility of decaying age. The framework\r\nof his nature, originally strong and massive, was not yet crumbled\r\ninto ruin.\r\n\r\nTo observe and define his character, however, under such\r\ndisadvantages, was as difficult a task as to trace out and build up\r\nanew, in imagination, an old fortress, like Ticonderoga, from a view\r\nof its gray and broken ruins. Here and there, perchance, the walls may\r\nremain almost complete, but elsewhere may be only a shapeless mound,\r\ncumbrous with its very strength, and overgrown, through long years of\r\npeace and neglect, with grass and alien weeds.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, looking at the old warrior with affection,—for, slight\r\nas was the communication between us, my feeling towards him, like that\r\nof all bipeds and quadrupeds who knew him, might not improperly be\r\ntermed so,—I could discern the main points of his portrait. It was\r\nmarked with the noble and heroic qualities which showed it to be not\r\nby a mere accident, but of good right, that he had won a distinguished\r\nname. His spirit could never, I conceive, have been characterized by\r\nan uneasy activity; it must, at any period of his life, have required\r\nan impulse to set him in motion; but, once stirred up, with obstacles\r\nto overcome, and an adequate object to be attained, it was not in the\r\nman to give out or fail. The heat that had formerly pervaded his\r\nnature, and which was not yet extinct, was never of the kind that\r\nflashes and flickers in a blaze; but, rather, a deep, red glow, as of\r\niron in a furnace. Weight, solidity, firmness; this was the expression\r\nof his repose, even in such decay as had crept untimely over him, at\r\nthe period of which I speak. But I could imagine, even then, that, under\r\nsome excitement which should go deeply into his consciousness,—roused\r\nby a trumpet-peal, loud enough to awaken all his energies that were\r\nnot dead, but only slumbering,—he was yet capable of flinging off his\r\ninfirmities like a sick man’s gown, dropping the staff of age to seize\r\na battle-sword, and starting up once more a warrior. And, in so\r\nintense a moment, his demeanor would have still been calm. Such an\r\nexhibition, however, was but to be pictured in fancy; not to be\r\nanticipated, nor desired. What I saw in him—as evidently as the\r\nindestructible ramparts of Old Ticonderoga already cited as the most\r\nappropriate simile—were the features of stubborn and ponderous\r\nendurance, which might well have amounted to obstinacy in his earlier\r\ndays; of integrity, that, like most of his other endowments, lay in a\r\nsomewhat heavy mass, and was just as unmalleable and unmanageable as a\r\nton of iron ore; and of benevolence, which, fiercely as he led the\r\nbayonets on at Chippewa or Fort Erie, I take to be of quite as genuine\r\na stamp as what actuates any or all the polemical philanthropists of\r\nthe age. He had slain men with his own hand, for aught I\r\nknow,—certainly, they had fallen, like blades of grass at the sweep\r\nof the scythe, before the charge to which his spirit imparted its\r\ntriumphant energy;—but, be that as it might, there was never in his\r\nheart so much cruelty as would have brushed the down off a butterfly’s\r\nwing. I have not known the man to whose innate kindliness I would more\r\nconfidently make an appeal.\r\n\r\nMany characteristics—and those, too, which contribute not the least\r\nforcibly to impart resemblance in a sketch—must have vanished, or\r\nbeen obscured, before I met the General. All merely graceful\r\nattributes are usually the most evanescent; nor does Nature adorn the\r\nhuman ruin with blossoms of new beauty, that have their roots and\r\nproper nutriment only in the chinks and crevices of decay, as she sows\r\nwall-flowers over the ruined fortress of Ticonderoga. Still, even in\r\nrespect of grace and beauty, there were points well worth noting. A\r\nray of humor, now and then, would make its way through the veil of dim\r\nobstruction, and glimmer pleasantly upon our faces. A trait of native\r\nelegance, seldom seen in the masculine character after childhood or\r\nearly youth, was shown in the General’s fondness for the sight and\r\nfragrance of flowers. An old soldier might be supposed to prize only\r\nthe bloody laurel on his brow; but here was one who seemed to have a\r\nyoung girl’s appreciation of the floral tribe.\r\n\r\nThere, beside the fireplace, the brave old General used to sit; while\r\nthe Surveyor—though seldom, when it could be avoided, taking upon\r\nhimself the difficult task of engaging him in conversation—was fond\r\nof standing at a distance, and watching his quiet and almost\r\nslumberous countenance. He seemed away from us, although we saw him\r\nbut a few yards off; remote, though we passed close beside his chair;\r\nunattainable, though we might have stretched forth our hands and\r\ntouched his own. It might be that he lived a more real life within\r\nhis thoughts, than amid the unappropriate environment of the\r\nCollector’s office. The evolutions of the parade; the tumult of the\r\nbattle; the flourish of old, heroic music, heard thirty years\r\nbefore;—such scenes and sounds, perhaps, were all alive before his\r\nintellectual sense. Meanwhile, the merchants and shipmasters, the\r\nspruce clerks and uncouth sailors, entered and departed; the bustle of\r\nthis commercial and custom-house life kept up its little murmur round\r\nabout him; and neither with the men nor their affairs did the General\r\nappear to sustain the most distant relation. He was as much out of\r\nplace as an old sword—now rusty, but which had flashed once in the\r\nbattle’s front, and showed still a bright gleam along its blade—would\r\nhave been, among the inkstands, paper-folders, and mahogany rulers, on\r\nthe Deputy Collector’s desk.\r\n\r\nThere was one thing that much aided me in renewing and re-creating the\r\nstalwart soldier of the Niagara frontier,—the man of true and simple\r\nenergy. It was the recollection of those memorable words of\r\nhis,—“I’ll try, Sir!”—spoken on the very verge of a desperate and\r\nheroic enterprise, and breathing the soul and spirit of New England\r\nhardihood, comprehending all perils, and encountering all. If, in our\r\ncountry, valor were rewarded by heraldic honor, this phrase—which it\r\nseems so easy to speak, but which only he, with such a task of danger\r\nand glory before him, has ever spoken—would be the best and fittest\r\nof all mottoes for the General’s shield of arms.\r\n\r\nIt contributes greatly towards a man’s moral and intellectual health,\r\nto be brought into habits of companionship with individuals unlike\r\nhimself, who care little for his pursuits, and whose sphere and\r\nabilities he must go out of himself to appreciate. The accidents of\r\nmy life have often afforded me this advantage, but never with more\r\nfulness and variety than during my continuance in office. There was\r\none man, especially, the observation of whose character gave me a new\r\nidea of talent. His gifts were emphatically those of a man of\r\nbusiness; prompt, acute, clear-minded; with an eye that saw through\r\nall perplexities, and a faculty of arrangement that made them vanish,\r\nas by the waving of an enchanter’s wand. Bred up from boyhood in the\r\nCustom-House, it was his proper field of activity; and the many\r\nintricacies of business, so harassing to the interloper, presented\r\nthemselves before him with the regularity of a perfectly comprehended\r\nsystem. In my contemplation, he stood as the ideal of his class. He\r\nwas, indeed, the Custom-House in himself; or, at all events, the\r\nmain-spring that kept its variously revolving wheels in motion; for,\r\nin an institution like this, where its officers are appointed to\r\nsubserve their own profit and convenience, and seldom with a leading\r\nreference to their fitness for the duty to be performed, they must\r\nperforce seek elsewhere the dexterity which is not in them. Thus, by\r\nan inevitable necessity, as a magnet attracts steel-filings, so did\r\nour man of business draw to himself the difficulties which everybody\r\nmet with. With an easy condescension, and kind forbearance towards our\r\nstupidity,—which, to his order of mind, must have seemed little short\r\nof crime,—would he forthwith, by the merest touch of his finger, make\r\nthe incomprehensible as clear as daylight. The merchants valued him\r\nnot less than we, his esoteric friends. His integrity was perfect: it\r\nwas a law of nature with him, rather than a choice or a principle; nor\r\ncan it be otherwise than the main condition of an intellect so\r\nremarkably clear and accurate as his, to be honest and regular in the\r\nadministration of affairs. A stain on his conscience, as to anything\r\nthat came within the range of his vocation, would trouble such a man\r\nvery much in the same way, though to a far greater degree, that an\r\nerror in the balance of an account or an ink-blot on the fair page of\r\na book of record. Here, in a word,—and it is a rare instance in my\r\nlife,—I had met with a person thoroughly adapted to the situation\r\nwhich he held.\r\n\r\nSuch were some of the people with whom I now found myself connected. I\r\ntook it in good part, at the hands of Providence, that I was thrown\r\ninto a position so little akin to my past habits, and set myself\r\nseriously to gather from it whatever profit was to be had. After my\r\nfellowship of toil and impracticable schemes with the dreamy brethren\r\nof Brook Farm; after living for three years within the subtile\r\ninfluence of an intellect like Emerson’s; after those wild, free days\r\non the Assabeth, indulging fantastic speculations, beside our fire of\r\nfallen boughs, with Ellery Channing; after talking with Thoreau about\r\npine-trees and Indian relics, in his hermitage at Walden; after\r\ngrowing fastidious by sympathy with the classic refinement of\r\nHillard’s culture; after becoming imbued with poetic sentiment at\r\nLongfellow’s hearthstone;—it was time, at length, that I should\r\nexercise other faculties of my nature, and nourish myself with food\r\nfor which I had hitherto had little appetite. Even the old Inspector\r\nwas desirable, as a change of diet, to a man who had known Alcott. I\r\nlook upon it as an evidence, in some measure, of a system naturally\r\nwell balanced, and lacking no essential part of a thorough\r\norganization, that, with such associates to remember, I could mingle\r\nat once with men of altogether different qualities, and never murmur\r\nat the change.\r\n\r\nLiterature, its exertions and objects, were now of little moment in\r\nmy regard. I cared not, at this period, for books; they were apart\r\nfrom me. Nature,—except it were human nature,—the nature that is\r\ndeveloped in earth and sky, was, in one sense, hidden from me; and all\r\nthe imaginative delight, wherewith it had been spiritualized, passed\r\naway out of my mind. A gift, a faculty if it had not departed, was\r\nsuspended and inanimate within me. There would have been something\r\nsad, unutterably dreary, in all this, had I not been conscious that it\r\nlay at my own option to recall whatever was valuable in the past. It\r\nmight be true, indeed, that this was a life which could not with\r\nimpunity be lived too long; else, it might have made me permanently\r\nother than I had been without transforming me into any shape which it\r\nwould be worth my while to take. But I never considered it as other\r\nthan a transitory life. There was always a prophetic instinct, a low\r\nwhisper in my ear, that, within no long period, and whenever a new\r\nchange of custom should be essential to my good, a change would come.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, there I was, a Surveyor of the Revenue, and, so far as I\r\nhave been able to understand, as good a Surveyor as need be. A man of\r\nthought, fancy, and sensibility (had he ten times the Surveyor’s\r\nproportion of those qualities) may, at any time, be a man of affairs,\r\nif he will only choose to give himself the trouble. My fellow-officers,\r\nand the merchants and sea-captains with whom my official duties\r\nbrought me into any manner of connection, viewed me in no other light,\r\nand probably knew me in no other character. None of them, I presume,\r\nhad ever read a page of my inditing, or would have cared a fig the\r\nmore for me, if they had read them all; nor would it have mended the\r\nmatter, in the least, had those same unprofitable pages been written\r\nwith a pen like that of Burns or of Chaucer, each of whom was a\r\ncustom-house officer in his day, as well as I. It is a good\r\nlesson—though it may often be a hard one—for a man who has dreamed of\r\nliterary fame, and of making for himself a rank among the world’s\r\ndignitaries by such means, to step aside out of the narrow circle in\r\nwhich his claims are recognized, and to find how utterly devoid of\r\nsignificance, beyond that circle, is all that he achieves, and all he\r\naims at. I know not that I especially needed the lesson, either in the\r\nway of warning or rebuke; but, at any rate, I learned it thoroughly:\r\nnor, it gives me pleasure to reflect, did the truth, as it came home\r\nto my perception, ever cost me a pang, or require to be thrown off in\r\na sigh. In the way of literary talk, it is true, the Naval Officer—an\r\nexcellent fellow, who came into office with me and went out only a\r\nlittle later—would often engage me in a discussion about one or the\r\nother of his favorite topics, Napoleon or Shakespeare. The Collector’s\r\njunior clerk, too—a young gentleman who, it was whispered,\r\noccasionally covered a sheet of Uncle Sam’s letter-paper with what (at\r\nthe distance of a few yards) looked very much like poetry—used now and\r\nthen to speak to me of books, as matters with which I might possibly\r\nbe conversant. This was my all of lettered intercourse; and it was\r\nquite sufficient for my necessities.\r\n\r\nNo longer seeking nor caring that my name should be blazoned abroad on\r\ntitle-pages, I smiled to think that it had now another kind of vogue.\r\nThe Custom-House marker imprinted it, with a stencil and black paint,\r\non pepper-bags, and baskets of anatto, and cigar-boxes, and bales of\r\nall kinds of dutiable merchandise, in testimony that these commodities\r\nhad paid the impost, and gone regularly through the office. Borne on\r\nsuch queer vehicle of fame, a knowledge of my existence, so far as a\r\nname conveys it, was carried where it had never been before, and, I\r\nhope, will never go again.\r\n\r\nBut the past was not dead. Once in a great while the thoughts that had\r\nseemed so vital and so active, yet had been put to rest so quietly,\r\nrevived again. One of the most remarkable occasions, when the habit of\r\nbygone days awoke in me, was that which brings it within the law of\r\nliterary propriety to offer the public the sketch which I am now\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nIn the second story of the Custom-House there is a large room, in\r\nwhich the brick-work and naked rafters have never been covered with\r\npanelling and plaster. The edifice—originally projected on a scale\r\nadapted to the old commercial enterprise of the port, and with an idea\r\nof subsequent prosperity destined never to be realized—contains far\r\nmore space than its occupants know what to do with. This airy hall,\r\ntherefore, over the Collector’s apartments, remains unfinished to this\r\nday, and, in spite of the aged cobwebs that festoon its dusky beams,\r\nappears still to await the labor of the carpenter and mason. At one\r\nend of the room, in a recess, were a number of barrels, piled one upon\r\nanother, containing bundles of official documents. Large quantities of\r\nsimilar rubbish lay lumbering the floor. It was sorrowful to think how\r\nmany days and weeks and months and years of toil had been wasted on\r\nthese musty papers, which were now only an encumbrance on earth, and\r\nwere hidden away in this forgotten corner, never more to be glanced at\r\nby human eyes. But, then, what reams of other manuscripts—filled not\r\nwith the dulness of official formalities, but with the thought of\r\ninventive brains and the rich effusion of deep hearts—had gone\r\nequally to oblivion; and that, moreover, without serving a purpose in\r\ntheir day, as these heaped-up papers had, and—saddest of\r\nall—without purchasing for their writers the comfortable livelihood\r\nwhich the clerks of the Custom-House had gained by these worthless\r\nscratchings of the pen! Yet not altogether worthless, perhaps, as\r\nmaterials of local history. Here, no doubt, statistics of the former\r\ncommerce of Salem might be discovered, and memorials of her princely\r\nmerchants,—old King Derby, old Billy Gray, old Simon Forrester, and\r\nmany another magnate in his day; whose powdered head, however, was\r\nscarcely in the tomb, before his mountain pile of wealth began to\r\ndwindle. The founders of the greater part of the families which now\r\ncompose the aristocracy of Salem might here be traced, from the petty\r\nand obscure beginnings of their traffic, at periods generally much\r\nposterior to the Revolution, upward to what their children look upon\r\nas long-established rank.\r\n\r\nPrior to the Revolution there is a dearth of records; the earlier\r\ndocuments and archives of the Custom-House having, probably, been\r\ncarried off to Halifax, when all the King’s officials accompanied the\r\nBritish army in its flight from Boston. It has often been a matter of\r\nregret with me; for, going back, perhaps, to the days of the\r\nProtectorate, those papers must have contained many references to\r\nforgotten or remembered men, and to antique customs, which would have\r\naffected me with the same pleasure as when I used to pick up Indian\r\narrow-heads in the field near the Old Manse.\r\n\r\nBut, one idle and rainy day, it was my fortune to make a discovery of\r\nsome little interest. Poking and burrowing into the heaped-up rubbish\r\nin the corner; unfolding one and another document, and reading the\r\nnames of vessels that had long ago foundered at sea or rotted at the\r\nwharves, and those of merchants, never heard of now on ’Change, nor\r\nvery readily decipherable on their mossy tombstones; glancing at such\r\nmatters with the saddened, weary, half-reluctant interest which we\r\nbestow on the corpse of dead activity,—and exerting my fancy,\r\nsluggish with little use, to raise up from these dry bones an image of\r\nthe old town’s brighter aspect, when India was a new region, and only\r\nSalem knew the way thither,—I chanced to lay my hand on a small\r\npackage, carefully done up in a piece of ancient yellow parchment.\r\nThis envelope had the air of an official record of some period long\r\npast, when clerks engrossed their stiff and formal chirography on more\r\nsubstantial materials than at present. There was something about it\r\nthat quickened an instinctive curiosity, and made me undo the faded\r\nred tape, that tied up the package, with the sense that a treasure\r\nwould here be brought to light. Unbending the rigid folds of the\r\nparchment cover, I found it to be a commission, under the hand and\r\nseal of Governor Shirley, in favor of one Jonathan Pue, as Surveyor of\r\nhis Majesty’s Customs for the port of Salem, in the Province of\r\nMassachusetts Bay. I remember to have read (probably in Felt’s Annals)\r\na notice of the decease of Mr. Surveyor Pue, about fourscore years\r\nago; and likewise, in a newspaper of recent times, an account of the\r\ndigging up of his remains in the little graveyard of St. Peter’s\r\nChurch, during the renewal of that edifice. Nothing, if I rightly call\r\nto mind, was left of my respected predecessor, save an imperfect\r\nskeleton, and some fragments of apparel, and a wig of majestic\r\nfrizzle; which, unlike the head that it once adorned, was in very\r\nsatisfactory preservation. But, on examining the papers which the\r\nparchment commission served to envelop, I found more traces of Mr.\r\nPue’s mental part, and the internal operations of his head, than the\r\nfrizzled wig had contained of the venerable skull itself.\r\n\r\nThey were documents, in short, not official, but of a private nature,\r\nor at least written in his private capacity, and apparently with his\r\nown hand. I could account for their being included in the heap of\r\nCustom-House lumber only by the fact that Mr. Pue’s death had happened\r\nsuddenly; and that these papers, which he probably kept in his\r\nofficial desk, had never come to the knowledge of his heirs, or were\r\nsupposed to relate to the business of the revenue. On the transfer of\r\nthe archives to Halifax, this package, proving to be of no public\r\nconcern, was left behind, and had remained ever since unopened.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Surveyor—being little molested, I suppose, at that early\r\nday, with business pertaining to his office—seems to have devoted\r\nsome of his many leisure hours to researches as a local antiquarian,\r\nand other inquisitions of a similar nature. These supplied material\r\nfor petty activity to a mind that would otherwise have been eaten up\r\nwith rust. A portion of his facts, by the by, did me good service in\r\nthe preparation of the article entitled “MAIN STREET,” included in the\r\npresent volume. The remainder may perhaps be applied to purposes\r\nequally valuable, hereafter; or not impossibly may be worked up, so\r\nfar as they go, into a regular history of Salem, should my veneration\r\nfor the natal soil ever impel me to so pious a task. Meanwhile, they\r\nshall be at the command of any gentleman, inclined, and competent, to\r\ntake the unprofitable labor off my hands. As a final disposition, I\r\ncontemplate depositing them with the Essex Historical Society.\r\n\r\nBut the object that most drew my attention, in the mysterious package,\r\nwas a certain affair of fine red cloth, much worn and faded. There\r\nwere traces about it of gold embroidery, which, however, was greatly\r\nfrayed and defaced; so that none, or very little, of the glitter was\r\nleft. It had been wrought, as was easy to perceive, with wonderful\r\nskill of needlework; and the stitch (as I am assured by ladies\r\nconversant with such mysteries) gives evidence of a now forgotten art,\r\nnot to be recovered even by the process of picking out the threads.\r\nThis rag of scarlet cloth,—for time and wear and a sacrilegious moth\r\nhad reduced it to little other than a rag,—on careful examination,\r\nassumed the shape of a letter. It was the capital letter A. By an\r\naccurate measurement, each limb proved to be precisely three inches\r\nand a quarter in length. It had been intended, there could be no\r\ndoubt, as an ornamental article of dress; but how it was to be worn,\r\nor what rank, honor, and dignity, in by-past times, were signified by\r\nit, was a riddle which (so evanescent are the fashions of the world in\r\nthese particulars) I saw little hope of solving. And yet it strangely\r\ninterested me. My eyes fastened themselves upon the old scarlet\r\nletter, and would not be turned aside. Certainly, there was some deep\r\nmeaning in it, most worthy of interpretation, and which, as it were,\r\nstreamed forth from the mystic symbol, subtly communicating itself to\r\nmy sensibilities, but evading the analysis of my mind.\r\n\r\nWhile thus perplexed,—and cogitating, among other hypotheses, whether\r\nthe letter might not have been one of those decorations which the\r\nwhite men used to contrive, in order to take the eyes of Indians,—I\r\nhappened to place it on my breast. It seemed to me,—the reader may\r\nsmile, but must not doubt my word,—it seemed to me, then, that I\r\nexperienced a sensation not altogether physical, yet almost so, of\r\nburning heat; and as if the letter were not of red cloth, but red-hot\r\niron. I shuddered, and involuntarily let it fall upon the floor.\r\n\r\nIn the absorbing contemplation of the scarlet letter, I had hitherto\r\nneglected to examine a small roll of dingy paper, around which it had\r\nbeen twisted. This I now opened, and had the satisfaction to find,\r\nrecorded by the old Surveyor’s pen, a reasonably complete explanation\r\nof the whole affair. There were several foolscap sheets containing\r\nmany particulars respecting the life and conversation of one Hester\r\nPrynne, who appeared to have been rather a noteworthy personage in the\r\nview of our ancestors. She had flourished during the period between\r\nthe early days of Massachusetts and the close of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. Aged persons, alive in the time of Mr. Surveyor Pue, and from\r\nwhose oral testimony he had made up his narrative, remembered her, in\r\ntheir youth, as a very old, but not decrepit woman, of a stately and\r\nsolemn aspect. It had been her habit, from an almost immemorial date,\r\nto go about the country as a kind of voluntary nurse, and doing\r\nwhatever miscellaneous good she might; taking upon herself, likewise,\r\nto give advice in all matters, especially those of the heart; by which\r\nmeans, as a person of such propensities inevitably must, she gained\r\nfrom many people the reverence due to an angel, but, I should imagine,\r\nwas looked upon by others as an intruder and a nuisance. Prying\r\nfurther into the manuscript, I found the record of other doings and\r\nsufferings of this singular woman, for most of which the reader is\r\nreferred to the story entitled “THE SCARLET LETTER”; and it should be\r\nborne carefully in mind, that the main facts of that story are\r\nauthorized and authenticated by the document of Mr. Surveyor Pue. The\r\noriginal papers, together with the scarlet letter itself,—a most\r\ncurious relic,—are still in my possession, and shall be freely\r\nexhibited to whomsoever, induced by the great interest of the\r\nnarrative, may desire a sight of them. I must not be understood as\r\naffirming, that, in the dressing up of the tale, and imagining the\r\nmotives and modes of passion that influenced the characters who figure\r\nin it, I have invariably confined myself within the limits of the old\r\nSurveyor’s half a dozen sheets of foolscap. On the contrary, I have\r\nallowed myself, as to such points, nearly or altogether as much\r\nlicense as if the facts had been entirely of my own invention. What I\r\ncontend for is the authenticity of the outline.\r\n\r\nThis incident recalled my mind, in some degree, to its old track.\r\nThere seemed to be here the groundwork of a tale. It impressed me as\r\nif the ancient Surveyor, in his garb of a hundred years gone by, and\r\nwearing his immortal wig,—which was buried with him, but did not\r\nperish in the grave,—had met me in the deserted chamber of the\r\nCustom-House. In his port was the dignity of one who had borne his\r\nMajesty’s commission, and who was therefore illuminated by a ray of\r\nthe splendor that shone so dazzlingly about the throne. How unlike,\r\nalas! the hang-dog look of a republican official, who, as the servant\r\nof the people, feels himself less than the least, and below the\r\nlowest, of his masters. With his own ghostly hand, the obscurely seen\r\nbut majestic figure had imparted to me the scarlet symbol, and the\r\nlittle roll of explanatory manuscript. With his own ghostly voice, he\r\nhad exhorted me, on the sacred consideration of my filial duty and\r\nreverence towards him,—who might reasonably regard himself as my\r\nofficial ancestor,—to bring his mouldy and moth-eaten lucubrations\r\nbefore the public. “Do this,” said the ghost of Mr. Surveyor Pue,\r\nemphatically nodding the head that looked so imposing within its\r\nmemorable wig,—“do this, and the profit shall be all your own! You\r\nwill shortly need it; for it is not in your days as it was in mine,\r\nwhen a man’s office was a life-lease, and oftentimes an heirloom.\r\nBut, I charge you, in this matter of old Mistress Prynne, give to your\r\npredecessor’s memory the credit which will be rightfully due!” And I\r\nsaid to the ghost of Mr. Surveyor Pue, “I will!”\r\n\r\nOn Hester Prynne’s story, therefore, I bestowed much thought. It was\r\nthe subject of my meditations for many an hour, while pacing to and\r\nfro across my room, or traversing, with a hundred-fold repetition, the\r\nlong extent from the front-door of the Custom-House to the\r\nside-entrance, and back again. Great were the weariness and annoyance\r\nof the old Inspector and the Weighers and Gaugers, whose slumbers were\r\ndisturbed by the unmercifully lengthened tramp of my passing and\r\nreturning footsteps. Remembering their own former habits, they used to\r\nsay that the Surveyor was walking the quarter-deck. They probably\r\nfancied that my sole object—and, indeed, the sole object for which a\r\nsane man could ever put himself into voluntary motion—was, to get an\r\nappetite for dinner. And to say the truth, an appetite, sharpened by\r\nthe east wind that generally blew along the passage, was the only\r\nvaluable result of so much indefatigable exercise. So little adapted\r\nis the atmosphere of a custom-house to the delicate harvest of fancy\r\nand sensibility, that, had I remained there through ten Presidencies\r\nyet to come, I doubt whether the tale of “The Scarlet Letter” would\r\never have been brought before the public eye. My imagination was a\r\ntarnished mirror. It would not reflect, or only with miserable\r\ndimness, the figures with which I did my best to people it. The\r\ncharacters of the narrative would not be warmed and rendered malleable\r\nby any heat that I could kindle at my intellectual forge. They would\r\ntake neither the glow of passion nor the tenderness of sentiment, but\r\nretained all the rigidity of dead corpses, and stared me in the face\r\nwith a fixed and ghastly grin of contemptuous defiance. “What have you\r\nto do with us?” that expression seemed to say. “The little power you\r\nmight once have possessed over the tribe of unrealities is gone! You\r\nhave bartered it for a pittance of the public gold. Go, then, and earn\r\nyour wages!” In short, the almost torpid creatures of my own fancy\r\ntwitted me with imbecility, and not without fair occasion.\r\n\r\nIt was not merely during the three hours and a half which Uncle Sam\r\nclaimed as his share of my daily life, that this wretched numbness\r\nheld possession of me. It went with me on my sea-shore walks, and\r\nrambles into the country, whenever—which was seldom and\r\nreluctantly—I bestirred myself to seek that invigorating charm of\r\nNature, which used to give me such freshness and activity of thought\r\nthe moment that I stepped across the threshold of the Old Manse. The\r\nsame torpor, as regarded the capacity for intellectual effort,\r\naccompanied me home, and weighed upon me in the chamber which I most\r\nabsurdly termed my study. Nor did it quit me, when, late at night, I\r\nsat in the deserted parlor, lighted only by the glimmering coal-fire\r\nand the moon, striving to picture forth imaginary scenes, which, the\r\nnext day, might flow out on the brightening page in many-hued\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nIf the imaginative faculty refused to act at such an hour, it might\r\nwell be deemed a hopeless case. Moonlight, in a familiar room, falling\r\nso white upon the carpet, and showing all its figures so\r\ndistinctly,—making every object so minutely visible, yet so unlike a\r\nmorning or noontide visibility,—is a medium the most suitable for a\r\nromance-writer to get acquainted with his illusive guests. There is\r\nthe little domestic scenery of the well-known apartment; the chairs,\r\nwith each its separate individuality; the centre-table, sustaining a\r\nwork-basket, a volume or two, and an extinguished lamp; the sofa; the\r\nbookcase; the picture on the wall;—all these details, so completely\r\nseen, are so spiritualized by the unusual light, that they seem to\r\nlose their actual substance, and become things of intellect. Nothing\r\nis too small or too trifling to undergo this change, and acquire\r\ndignity thereby. A child’s shoe; the doll, seated in her little wicker\r\ncarriage; the hobby-horse;—whatever, in a word, has been used or\r\nplayed with, during the day, is now invested with a quality of\r\nstrangeness and remoteness, though still almost as vividly present as\r\nby daylight. Thus, therefore, the floor of our familiar room has\r\nbecome a neutral territory, somewhere between the real world and\r\nfairy-land, where the Actual and the Imaginary may meet, and each\r\nimbue itself with the nature of the other. Ghosts might enter here,\r\nwithout affrighting us. It would be too much in keeping with the scene\r\nto excite surprise, were we to look about us and discover a form\r\nbeloved, but gone hence, now sitting quietly in a streak of this magic\r\nmoonshine, with an aspect that would make us doubt whether it had\r\nreturned from afar, or had never once stirred from our fireside.\r\n\r\nThe somewhat dim coal-fire has an essential influence in producing the\r\neffect which I would describe. It throws its unobtrusive tinge\r\nthroughout the room, with a faint ruddiness upon the walls and\r\nceiling, and a reflected gleam from the polish of the furniture. This\r\nwarmer light mingles itself with the cold spirituality of the\r\nmoonbeams, and communicates, as it were, a heart and sensibilities of\r\nhuman tenderness to the forms which fancy summons up. It converts them\r\nfrom snow-images into men and women. Glancing at the looking-glass, we\r\nbehold—deep within its haunted verge—the smouldering glow of the\r\nhalf-extinguished anthracite, the white moonbeams on the floor, and a\r\nrepetition of all the gleam and shadow of the picture, with one remove\r\nfurther from the actual, and nearer to the imaginative. Then, at such\r\nan hour, and with this scene before him, if a man, sitting all alone,\r\ncannot dream strange things, and make them look like truth, he need\r\nnever try to write romances.\r\n\r\nBut, for myself, during the whole of my Custom-House experience,\r\nmoonlight and sunshine, and the glow of firelight, were just alike in\r\nmy regard; and neither of them was of one whit more avail than the\r\ntwinkle of a tallow-candle. An entire class of susceptibilities, and a\r\ngift connected with them,—of no great richness or value, but the best\r\nI had,—was gone from me.\r\n\r\nIt is my belief, however, that, had I attempted a different order of\r\ncomposition, my faculties would not have been found so pointless and\r\ninefficacious. I might, for instance, have contented myself with\r\nwriting out the narratives of a veteran shipmaster, one of the\r\nInspectors, whom I should be most ungrateful not to mention, since\r\nscarcely a day passed that he did not stir me to laughter and\r\nadmiration by his marvellous gifts as a story-teller. Could I have\r\npreserved the picturesque force of his style, and the humorous\r\ncoloring which nature taught him how to throw over his descriptions,\r\nthe result, I honestly believe, would have been something new in\r\nliterature. Or I might readily have found a more serious task. It was\r\na folly, with the materiality of this daily life pressing so\r\nintrusively upon me, to attempt to fling myself back into another age;\r\nor to insist on creating the semblance of a world out of airy matter,\r\nwhen, at every moment, the impalpable beauty of my soap-bubble was\r\nbroken by the rude contact of some actual circumstance. The wiser\r\neffort would have been, to diffuse thought and imagination through\r\nthe opaque substance of to-day, and thus to make it a bright\r\ntransparency; to spiritualize the burden that began to weigh so\r\nheavily; to seek, resolutely, the true and indestructible value that\r\nlay hidden in the petty and wearisome incidents, and ordinary\r\ncharacters, with which I was now conversant. The fault was mine. The\r\npage of life that was spread out before me seemed dull and\r\ncommonplace, only because I had not fathomed its deeper import. A\r\nbetter book than I shall ever write was there; leaf after leaf\r\npresenting itself to me, just as it was written out by the reality of\r\nthe flitting hour, and vanishing as fast as written, only because my\r\nbrain wanted the insight and my hand the cunning to transcribe it. At\r\nsome future day, it may be, I shall remember a few scattered fragments\r\nand broken paragraphs, and write them down, and find the letters turn\r\nto gold upon the page.\r\n\r\nThese perceptions have come too late. At the instant, I was only\r\nconscious that what would have been a pleasure once was now a hopeless\r\ntoil. There was no occasion to make much moan about this state of\r\naffairs. I had ceased to be a writer of tolerably poor tales and\r\nessays, and had become a tolerably good Surveyor of the Customs. That\r\nwas all. But, nevertheless, it is anything but agreeable to be haunted\r\nby a suspicion that one’s intellect is dwindling away; or exhaling,\r\nwithout your consciousness, like ether out of a phial; so that, at\r\nevery glance, you find a smaller and less volatile residuum. Of the\r\nfact there could be no doubt; and, examining myself and others, I was\r\nled to conclusions, in reference to the effect of public office on the\r\ncharacter, not very favorable to the mode of life in question. In some\r\nother form, perhaps, I may hereafter develop these effects. Suffice it\r\nhere to say, that a Custom-House officer, of long continuance, can\r\nhardly be a very praiseworthy or respectable personage, for many\r\nreasons; one of them, the tenure by which he holds his situation, and\r\nanother, the very nature of his business, which—though, I trust, an\r\nhonest one—is of such a sort that he does not share in the united\r\neffort of mankind.\r\n\r\nAn effect—which I believe to be observable, more or less, in every\r\nindividual who has occupied the position—is, that, while he leans on\r\nthe mighty arm of the Republic, his own proper strength departs from\r\nhim. He loses, in an extent proportioned to the weakness or force of\r\nhis original nature, the capability of self-support. If he possess an\r\nunusual share of native energy, or the enervating magic of place do\r\nnot operate too long upon him, his forfeited powers may be redeemable.\r\nThe ejected officer—fortunate in the unkindly shove that sends him\r\nforth betimes, to struggle amid a struggling world—may return to\r\nhimself, and become all that he has ever been. But this seldom\r\nhappens. He usually keeps his ground just long enough for his own\r\nruin, and is then thrust out, with sinews all unstrung, to totter\r\nalong the difficult footpath of life as he best may. Conscious of his\r\nown infirmity,—that his tempered steel and elasticity are lost,—he\r\nforever afterwards looks wistfully about him in quest of support\r\nexternal to himself. His pervading and continual hope—a hallucination\r\nwhich, in the face of all discouragement, and making light of\r\nimpossibilities, haunts him while he lives, and, I fancy, like the\r\nconvulsive throes of the cholera, torments him for a brief space after\r\ndeath—is, that finally, and in no long time, by some happy\r\ncoincidence of circumstances, he shall be restored to office. This\r\nfaith, more than anything else, steals the pith and availability out\r\nof whatever enterprise he may dream of undertaking. Why should he toil\r\nand moil, and be at so much trouble to pick himself up out of the\r\nmud, when, in a little while hence, the strong arm of his Uncle will\r\nraise and support him? Why should he work for his living here, or go\r\nto dig gold in California, when he is so soon to be made happy, at\r\nmonthly intervals, with a little pile of glittering coin out of his\r\nUncle’s pocket? It is sadly curious to observe how slight a taste of\r\noffice suffices to infect a poor fellow with this singular disease.\r\nUncle Sam’s gold—meaning no disrespect to the worthy old\r\ngentleman—has, in this respect, a quality of enchantment like that of\r\nthe Devil’s wages. Whoever touches it should look well to himself, or\r\nhe may find the bargain to go hard against him, involving, if not his\r\nsoul, yet many of its better attributes; its sturdy force, its courage\r\nand constancy, its truth, its self-reliance, and all that gives the\r\nemphasis to manly character.\r\n\r\nHere was a fine prospect in the distance! Not that the Surveyor\r\nbrought the lesson home to himself, or admitted that he could be so\r\nutterly undone, either by continuance in office, or ejectment. Yet my\r\nreflections were not the most comfortable. I began to grow melancholy\r\nand restless; continually prying into my mind, to discover which of\r\nits poor properties were gone, and what degree of detriment had\r\nalready accrued to the remainder. I endeavored to calculate how much\r\nlonger I could stay in the Custom-House, and yet go forth a man. To\r\nconfess the truth, it was my greatest apprehension,—as it would never\r\nbe a measure of policy to turn out so quiet an individual as myself,\r\nand it being hardly in the nature of a public officer to resign,—it\r\nwas my chief trouble, therefore, that I was likely to grow gray and\r\ndecrepit in the Surveyorship, and become much such another animal as\r\nthe old Inspector. Might it not, in the tedious lapse of official\r\nlife that lay before me, finally be with me as it was with this\r\nvenerable friend,—to make the dinner-hour the nucleus of the day, and\r\nto spend the rest of it, as an old dog spends it, asleep in the\r\nsunshine or in the shade? A dreary look-forward this, for a man who\r\nfelt it to be the best definition of happiness to live throughout the\r\nwhole range of his faculties and sensibilities! But, all this while, I\r\nwas giving myself very unnecessary alarm. Providence had meditated\r\nbetter things for me than I could possibly imagine for myself.\r\n\r\nA remarkable event of the third year of my Surveyorship—to adopt the\r\ntone of “P. P.”—was the election of General Taylor to the Presidency.\r\nIt is essential, in order to form a complete estimate of the advantages of\r\nofficial life, to view the incumbent at the incoming of a hostile\r\nadministration. His position is then one of the most singularly\r\nirksome, and, in every contingency, disagreeable, that a wretched\r\nmortal can possibly occupy; with seldom an alternative of good, on\r\neither hand, although what presents itself to him as the worst event\r\nmay very probably be the best. But it is a strange experience, to a\r\nman of pride and sensibility, to know that his interests are within\r\nthe control of individuals who neither love nor understand him, and by\r\nwhom, since one or the other must needs happen, he would rather be\r\ninjured than obliged. Strange, too, for one who has kept his calmness\r\nthroughout the contest, to observe the blood-thirstiness that is\r\ndeveloped in the hour of triumph, and to be conscious that he is\r\nhimself among its objects! There are few uglier traits of human nature\r\nthan this tendency—which I now witnessed in men no worse than their\r\nneighbors—to grow cruel, merely because they possessed the power of\r\ninflicting harm. If the guillotine, as applied to office-holders,\r\nwere a literal fact instead of one of the most apt of metaphors, it is\r\nmy sincere belief that the active members of the victorious party were\r\nsufficiently excited to have chopped off all our heads, and have\r\nthanked Heaven for the opportunity! It appears to me—who have been a\r\ncalm and curious observer, as well in victory as defeat—that this\r\nfierce and bitter spirit of malice and revenge has never distinguished\r\nthe many triumphs of my own party as it now did that of the Whigs. The\r\nDemocrats take the offices, as a general rule, because they need them,\r\nand because the practice of many years has made it the law of\r\npolitical warfare, which, unless a different system be proclaimed, it\r\nwere weakness and cowardice to murmur at. But the long habit of\r\nvictory has made them generous. They know how to spare, when they see\r\noccasion; and when they strike, the axe may be sharp, indeed, but its\r\nedge is seldom poisoned with ill-will; nor is it their custom\r\nignominiously to kick the head which they have just struck off.\r\n\r\nIn short, unpleasant as was my predicament, at best, I saw much reason\r\nto congratulate myself that I was on the losing side, rather than the\r\ntriumphant one. If, heretofore, I had been none of the warmest of\r\npartisans, I began now, at this season of peril and adversity, to be\r\npretty acutely sensible with which party my predilections lay; nor was\r\nit without something like regret and shame, that, according to a\r\nreasonable calculation of chances, I saw my own prospect of retaining\r\noffice to be better than those of my Democratic brethren. But who can\r\nsee an inch into futurity, beyond his nose? My own head was the first\r\nthat fell!\r\n\r\nThe moment when a man’s head drops off is seldom or never, I am\r\ninclined to think, precisely the most agreeable of his life.\r\nNevertheless, like the greater part of our misfortunes, even so\r\nserious a contingency brings its remedy and consolation with it, if\r\nthe sufferer will but make the best, rather than the worst, of the\r\naccident which has befallen him. In my particular case, the\r\nconsolatory topics were close at hand, and, indeed, had suggested\r\nthemselves to my meditations a considerable time before it was\r\nrequisite to use them. In view of my previous weariness of office, and\r\nvague thoughts of resignation, my fortune somewhat resembled that of a\r\nperson who should entertain an idea of committing suicide, and,\r\nalthough beyond his hopes, meet with the good hap to be murdered. In\r\nthe Custom-House, as before in the Old Manse, I had spent three years;\r\na term long enough to rest a weary brain; long enough to break off old\r\nintellectual habits, and make room for new ones; long enough, and too\r\nlong, to have lived in an unnatural state, doing what was really of no\r\nadvantage nor delight to any human being, and withholding myself from\r\ntoil that would, at least, have stilled an unquiet impulse in me.\r\nThen, moreover, as regarded his unceremonious ejectment, the late\r\nSurveyor was not altogether ill-pleased to be recognized by the Whigs\r\nas an enemy; since his inactivity in political affairs—his tendency\r\nto roam, at will, in that broad and quiet field where all mankind may\r\nmeet, rather than confine himself to those narrow paths where brethren\r\nof the same household must diverge from one another—had sometimes\r\nmade it questionable with his brother Democrats whether he was a\r\nfriend. Now, after he had won the crown of martyrdom (though with no\r\nlonger a head to wear it on), the point might be looked upon as\r\nsettled. Finally, little heroic as he was, it seemed more decorous to\r\nbe overthrown in the downfall of the party with which he had been\r\ncontent to stand, than to remain a forlorn survivor, when so many\r\nworthier men were falling; and, at last, after subsisting for four\r\nyears on the mercy of a hostile administration, to be compelled then\r\nto define his position anew, and claim the yet more humiliating mercy\r\nof a friendly one.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the press had taken up my affair, and kept me, for a week or\r\ntwo, careering through the public prints, in my decapitated state,\r\nlike Irving’s Headless Horseman; ghastly and grim, and longing to be\r\nburied, as a politically dead man ought. So much for my figurative\r\nself. The real human being, all this time, with his head safely on his\r\nshoulders, had brought himself to the comfortable conclusion that\r\neverything was for the best; and, making an investment in ink, paper,\r\nand steel-pens, had opened his long-disused writing-desk, and was\r\nagain a literary man.\r\n\r\nNow it was that the lucubrations of my ancient predecessor, Mr.\r\nSurveyor Pue, came into play. Rusty through long idleness, some little\r\nspace was requisite before my intellectual machinery could be brought\r\nto work upon the tale, with an effect in any degree satisfactory. Even\r\nyet, though my thoughts were ultimately much absorbed in the task, it\r\nwears, to my eye, a stern and sombre aspect; too much ungladdened by\r\ngenial sunshine; too little relieved by the tender and familiar\r\ninfluences which soften almost every scene of nature and real life,\r\nand, undoubtedly, should soften every picture of them. This\r\nuncaptivating effect is perhaps due to the period of hardly\r\naccomplished revolution, and still seething turmoil, in which the\r\nstory shaped itself. It is no indication, however, of a lack of\r\ncheerfulness in the writer’s mind; for he was happier, while straying\r\nthrough the gloom of these sunless fantasies, than at any time since\r\nhe had quitted the Old Manse. Some of the briefer articles, which\r\ncontribute to make up the volume, have likewise been written since my\r\ninvoluntary withdrawal from the toils and honors of public life, and\r\nthe remainder are gleaned from annuals and magazines of such antique\r\ndate that they have gone round the circle, and come back to novelty\r\nagain.[1] Keeping up the metaphor of the political guillotine, the\r\nwhole may be considered as the POSTHUMOUS PAPERS OF A DECAPITATED\r\nSURVEYOR; and the sketch which I am now bringing to a close, if too\r\nautobiographical for a modest person to publish in his lifetime, will\r\nreadily be excused in a gentleman who writes from beyond the grave.\r\nPeace be with all the world! My blessing on my friends! My forgiveness\r\nto my enemies! For I am in the realm of quiet!\r\n\r\n [Footnote 1: At the time of writing this article the author\r\n intended to publish, along with “The Scarlet Letter,” several\r\n shorter tales and sketches. These it has been thought\r\n advisable to defer.]\r\n\r\nThe life of the Custom-House lies like a dream behind me. The old\r\nInspector,—who, by the by, I regret to say, was overthrown and killed\r\nby a horse, some time ago; else he would certainly have lived\r\nforever,—he, and all those other venerable personages who sat with\r\nhim at the receipt of custom, are but shadows in my view; white-headed\r\nand wrinkled images, which my fancy used to sport with, and has now\r\nflung aside forever. The merchants,—Pingree, Phillips, Shepard,\r\nUpton, Kimball, Bertram, Hunt,—these, and many other names, which had\r\nsuch a classic familiarity for my ear six months ago,—these men of\r\ntraffic, who seemed to occupy so important a position in the\r\nworld,—how little time has it required to disconnect me from them\r\nall, not merely in act, but recollection! It is with an effort that I\r\nrecall the figures and appellations of these few. Soon, likewise, my\r\nold native town will loom upon me through the haze of memory, a mist\r\nbrooding over and around it; as if it were no portion of the real\r\nearth, but an overgrown village in cloud-land, with only imaginary\r\ninhabitants to people its wooden houses, and walk its homely lanes,\r\nand the unpicturesque prolixity of its main street. Henceforth it\r\nceases to be a reality of my life. I am a citizen of somewhere else.\r\nMy good towns-people will not much regret me; for—though it has been\r\nas dear an object as any, in my literary efforts, to be of some\r\nimportance in their eyes, and to win myself a pleasant memory in this\r\nabode and burial-place of so many of my forefathers—_there_ has never\r\nbeen, for me, the genial atmosphere which a literary man requires, in\r\norder to ripen the best harvest of his mind. I shall do better amongst\r\nother faces; and these familiar ones, it need hardly be said, will do\r\njust as well without me.\r\n\r\nIt may be, however,—O, transporting and triumphant thought!—that the\r\ngreat-grandchildren of the present race may sometimes think kindly of\r\nthe scribbler of bygone days, when the antiquary of days to come,\r\namong the sites memorable in the town’s history, shall point out the\r\nlocality of THE TOWN PUMP!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\n[Illustration: The Prison Door]\r\n\n[Illustration: Vignette,—Wild Rose]\r\n\r\n THE SCARLET LETTER."

      "content": "THE PRISON-DOOR.\r\n\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA throng of bearded men, in sad-colored garments, and gray,\r\nsteeple-crowned hats, intermixed with women, some wearing hoods and\r\nothers bareheaded, was assembled in front of a wooden edifice, the\r\ndoor of which was heavily timbered with oak, and studded with iron\r\nspikes.\r\n\r\nThe founders of a new colony, whatever Utopia of human virtue and\r\nhappiness they might originally project, have invariably recognized it\r\namong their earliest practical necessities to allot a portion of the\r\nvirgin soil as a cemetery, and another portion as the site of a\r\nprison. In accordance with this rule, it may safely be assumed that\r\nthe forefathers of Boston had built the first prison-house somewhere\r\nin the vicinity of Cornhill, almost as seasonably as they marked out\r\nthe first burial-ground, on Isaac Johnson’s lot, and round about his\r\ngrave, which subsequently became the nucleus of all the congregated\r\nsepulchres in the old churchyard of King’s Chapel. Certain it is,\r\nthat, some fifteen or twenty years after the settlement of the town,\r\nthe wooden jail was already marked with weather-stains and other\r\nindications of age, which gave a yet darker aspect to its\r\nbeetle-browed and gloomy front. The rust on the ponderous iron-work of\r\nits oaken door looked more antique than anything else in the New\r\nWorld. Like all that pertains to crime, it seemed never to have known\r\na youthful era. Before this ugly edifice, and between it and the\r\nwheel-track of the street, was a grass-plot, much overgrown with\r\nburdock, pigweed, apple-peru, and such unsightly vegetation, which\r\nevidently found something congenial in the soil that had so early\r\nborne the black flower of civilized society, a prison. But on one side\r\nof the portal, and rooted almost at the threshold, was a wild\r\nrose-bush, covered, in this month of June, with its delicate gems,\r\nwhich might be imagined to offer their fragrance and fragile beauty to\r\nthe prisoner as he went in, and to the condemned criminal as he came\r\nforth to his doom, in token that the deep heart of Nature could pity\r\nand be kind to him.\r\n\r\nThis rose-bush, by a strange chance, has been kept alive in history;\r\nbut whether it had merely survived out of the stern old wilderness, so\r\nlong after the fall of the gigantic pines and oaks that originally\r\novershadowed it,—or whether, as there is fair authority for\r\nbelieving, it had sprung up under the footsteps of the sainted Ann\r\nHutchinson, as she entered the prison-door,—we shall not take upon us\r\nto determine. Finding it so directly on the threshold of our\r\nnarrative, which is now about to issue from that inauspicious portal,\r\nwe could hardly do otherwise than pluck one of its flowers, and\r\npresent it to the reader. It may serve, let us hope, to symbolize some\r\nsweet moral blossom, that may be found along the track, or relieve the\r\ndarkening close of a tale of human frailty and sorrow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\n [Illustration]"

      "content": "THE MARKET-PLACE.\r\n\nThe grass-plot before the jail, in Prison Lane, on a certain summer\r\nmorning, not less than two centuries ago, was occupied by a pretty\r\nlarge number of the inhabitants of Boston; all with their eyes\r\nintently fastened on the iron-clamped oaken door. Amongst any other\r\npopulation, or at a later period in the history of New England, the\r\ngrim rigidity that petrified the bearded physiognomies of these good\r\npeople would have augured some awful business in hand. It could have\r\nbetokened nothing short of the anticipated execution of some noted\r\nculprit, on whom the sentence of a legal tribunal had but confirmed\r\nthe verdict of public sentiment. But, in that early severity of the\r\nPuritan character, an inference of this kind could not so indubitably\r\nbe drawn. It might be that a sluggish bond-servant, or an undutiful\r\nchild, whom his parents had given over to the civil authority, was to\r\nbe corrected at the whipping-post. It might be, that an Antinomian, a\r\nQuaker, or other heterodox religionist was to be scourged out of the\r\ntown, or an idle and vagrant Indian, whom the white man’s fire-water\r\nhad made riotous about the streets, was to be driven with stripes into\r\nthe shadow of the forest. It might be, too, that a witch, like old\r\nMistress Hibbins, the bitter-tempered widow of the magistrate, was to\r\ndie upon the gallows. In either case, there was very much the same\r\nsolemnity of demeanor on the part of the spectators; as befitted a\r\npeople amongst whom religion and law were almost identical, and in\r\nwhose character both were so thoroughly interfused, that the mildest\r\nand the severest acts of public discipline were alike made venerable\r\nand awful. Meagre, indeed, and cold was the sympathy that a\r\ntransgressor might look for, from such bystanders, at the scaffold. On\r\nthe other hand, a penalty, which, in our days, would infer a degree of\r\nmocking infamy and ridicule, might then be invested with almost as\r\nstern a dignity as the punishment of death itself.\r\n\r\nIt was a circumstance to be noted, on the summer morning when our\r\nstory begins its course, that the women, of whom there were several in\r\nthe crowd, appeared to take a peculiar interest in whatever penal\r\ninfliction might be expected to ensue. The age had not so much\r\nrefinement, that any sense of impropriety restrained the wearers of\r\npetticoat and farthingale from stepping forth into the public ways,\r\nand wedging their not unsubstantial persons, if occasion were, into\r\nthe throng nearest to the scaffold at an execution. Morally, as well\r\nas materially, there was a coarser fibre in those wives and maidens of\r\nold English birth and breeding, than in their fair descendants,\r\nseparated from them by a series of six or seven generations; for,\r\nthroughout that chain of ancestry, every successive mother has\r\ntransmitted to her child a fainter bloom, a more delicate and briefer\r\nbeauty, and a slighter physical frame, if not a character of less\r\nforce and solidity, than her own. The women who were now standing\r\nabout the prison-door stood within less than half a century of the\r\nperiod when the man-like Elizabeth had been the not altogether\r\nunsuitable representative of the sex. They were her countrywomen; and\r\nthe beef and ale of their native land, with a moral diet not a whit\r\nmore refined, entered largely into their composition. The bright\r\nmorning sun, therefore, shone on broad shoulders and well-developed\r\nbusts, and on round and ruddy cheeks, that had ripened in the far-off\r\nisland, and had hardly yet grown paler or thinner in the atmosphere of\r\nNew England. There was, moreover, a boldness and rotundity of speech\r\namong these matrons, as most of them seemed to be, that would startle\r\nus at the present day, whether in respect to its purport or its volume\r\nof tone.\r\n\r\n“Goodwives,” said a hard-featured dame of fifty, “I’ll tell ye a piece\r\nof my mind. It would be greatly for the public behoof, if we women,\r\nbeing of mature age and church-members in good repute, should have the\r\nhandling of such malefactresses as this Hester Prynne. What think ye,\r\ngossips? If the hussy stood up for judgment before us five, that are\r\nnow here in a knot together, would she come off with such a sentence\r\nas the worshipful magistrates have awarded? Marry, I trow not!”\r\n\r\n“People say,” said another, “that the Reverend Master Dimmesdale, her\r\ngodly pastor, takes it very grievously to heart that such a scandal\r\nshould have come upon his congregation.”\r\n\r\n“The magistrates are God-fearing gentlemen, but merciful\r\novermuch,—that is a truth,” added a third autumnal matron. “At the\r\nvery least, they should have put the brand of a hot iron on Hester\r\nPrynne’s forehead. Madam Hester would have winced at that, I warrant\r\nme. But she,—the naughty baggage,—little will she care what they\r\nput upon the bodice of her gown! Why, look you, she may cover it with\r\na brooch, or such like heathenish adornment, and so walk the streets\r\nas brave as ever!”\r\n\r\n“Ah, but,” interposed, more softly, a young wife, holding a child by\r\nthe hand, “let her cover the mark as she will, the pang of it will be\r\nalways in her heart.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Gossips]\r\n\r\n“What do we talk of marks and brands, whether on the bodice of her\r\ngown, or the flesh of her forehead?” cried another female, the ugliest\r\nas well as the most pitiless of these self-constituted judges. “This\r\nwoman has brought shame upon us all, and ought to die. Is there not\r\nlaw for it? Truly, there is, both in the Scripture and the\r\nstatute-book. Then let the magistrates, who have made it of no effect,\r\nthank themselves if their own wives and daughters go astray!”\r\n\r\n“Mercy on us, goodwife,” exclaimed a man in the crowd, “is there no\r\nvirtue in woman, save what springs from a wholesome fear of the\r\ngallows? That is the hardest word yet! Hush, now, gossips! for the\r\nlock is turning in the prison-door, and here comes Mistress Prynne\r\nherself.”\r\n\r\nThe door of the jail being flung open from within, there appeared, in\r\nthe first place, like a black shadow emerging into sunshine, the grim\r\nand grisly presence of the town-beadle, with a sword by his side, and\r\nhis staff of office in his hand. This personage prefigured and\r\nrepresented in his aspect the whole dismal severity of the Puritanic\r\ncode of law, which it was his business to administer in its final and\r\nclosest application to the offender. Stretching forth the official\r\nstaff in his left hand, he laid his right upon the shoulder of a young\r\nwoman, whom he thus drew forward; until, on the threshold of the\r\nprison-door, she repelled him, by an action marked with natural\r\ndignity and force of character, and stepped into the open air, as if\r\nby her own free will. She bore in her arms a child, a baby of some\r\nthree months old, who winked and turned aside its little face from the\r\ntoo vivid light of day; because its existence, heretofore, had brought\r\nit acquainted only with the gray twilight of a dungeon, or other\r\ndarksome apartment of the prison.\r\n\r\nWhen the young woman—the mother of this child—stood fully revealed\r\nbefore the crowd, it seemed to be her first impulse to clasp the\r\ninfant closely to her bosom; not so much by an impulse of motherly\r\naffection, as that she might thereby conceal a certain token, which\r\nwas wrought or fastened into her dress. In a moment, however, wisely\r\njudging that one token of her shame would but poorly serve to hide\r\nanother, she took the baby on her arm, and, with a burning blush, and\r\nyet a haughty smile, and a glance that would not be abashed, looked\r\naround at her towns-people and neighbors. On the breast of her gown,\r\nin fine red cloth, surrounded with an elaborate embroidery and\r\nfantastic flourishes of gold-thread, appeared the letter A. It was so\r\nartistically done, and with so much fertility and gorgeous luxuriance\r\nof fancy, that it had all the effect of a last and fitting decoration\r\nto the apparel which she wore; and which was of a splendor in\r\naccordance with the taste of the age, but greatly beyond what was\r\nallowed by the sumptuary regulations of the colony.\r\n\r\nThe young woman was tall, with a figure of perfect elegance on a large\r\nscale. She had dark and abundant hair, so glossy that it threw off the\r\nsunshine with a gleam, and a face which, besides being beautiful from\r\nregularity of feature and richness of complexion, had the\r\nimpressiveness belonging to a marked brow and deep black eyes. She was\r\nlady-like, too, after the manner of the feminine gentility of those\r\ndays; characterized by a certain state and dignity, rather than by the\r\ndelicate, evanescent, and indescribable grace, which is now recognized\r\nas its indication. And never had Hester Prynne appeared more\r\nlady-like, in the antique interpretation of the term, than as she\r\nissued from the prison. Those who had before known her, and had\r\nexpected to behold her dimmed and obscured by a disastrous cloud, were\r\nastonished, and even startled, to perceive how her beauty shone out,\r\nand made a halo of the misfortune and ignominy in which she was\r\nenveloped. It may be true, that, to a sensitive observer, there was\r\nsomething exquisitely painful in it. Her attire, which, indeed, she\r\nhad wrought for the occasion, in prison, and had modelled much after\r\nher own fancy, seemed to express the attitude of her spirit, the\r\ndesperate recklessness of her mood, by its wild and picturesque\r\npeculiarity. But the point which drew all eyes, and, as it were,\r\ntransfigured the wearer,—so that both men and women, who had been\r\nfamiliarly acquainted with Hester Prynne, were now impressed as if\r\nthey beheld her for the first time,—was that SCARLET LETTER, so\r\nfantastically embroidered and illuminated upon her bosom. It had the\r\neffect of a spell, taking her out of the ordinary relations with\r\nhumanity, and enclosing her in a sphere by herself.\r\n\r\n“She hath good skill at her needle, that’s certain,” remarked one of\r\nher female spectators; “but did ever a woman, before this brazen\r\nhussy, contrive such a way of showing it! Why, gossips, what is it but\r\nto laugh in the faces of our godly magistrates, and make a pride out\r\nof what they, worthy gentlemen, meant for a punishment?”\r\n\r\n“It were well,” muttered the most iron-visaged of the old dames, “if\r\nwe stripped Madam Hester’s rich gown off her dainty shoulders; and as\r\nfor the red letter, which she hath stitched so curiously, I’ll bestow\r\na rag of mine own rheumatic flannel, to make a fitter one!”\r\n\r\n“O, peace, neighbors, peace!” whispered their youngest companion; “do\r\nnot let her hear you! Not a stitch in that embroidered letter but she\r\nhas felt it in her heart.”\r\n\r\nThe grim beadle now made a gesture with his staff.\r\n\r\n“Make way, good people, make way, in the King’s name!” cried he. “Open\r\na passage; and, I promise ye, Mistress Prynne shall be set where man,\r\nwoman, and child may have a fair sight of her brave apparel, from this\r\ntime till an hour past meridian. A blessing on the righteous Colony of\r\nthe Massachusetts, where iniquity is dragged out into the sunshine!\r\nCome along, Madam Hester, and show your scarlet letter in the\r\nmarket-place!”\r\n\r\nA lane was forthwith opened through the crowd of spectators. Preceded\r\nby the beadle, and attended by an irregular procession of\r\nstern-browed men and unkindly visaged women, Hester Prynne set forth\r\ntowards the place appointed for her punishment. A crowd of eager and\r\ncurious school-boys, understanding little of the matter in hand,\r\nexcept that it gave them a half-holiday, ran before her progress,\r\nturning their heads continually to stare into her face, and at the\r\nwinking baby in her arms, and at the ignominious letter on her breast.\r\nIt was no great distance, in those days, from the prison-door to the\r\nmarket-place. Measured by the prisoner’s experience, however, it might\r\nbe reckoned a journey of some length; for, haughty as her demeanor\r\nwas, she perchance underwent an agony from every footstep of those\r\nthat thronged to see her, as if her heart had been flung into the\r\nstreet for them all to spurn and trample upon. In our nature, however,\r\nthere is a provision, alike marvellous and merciful, that the sufferer\r\nshould never know the intensity of what he endures by its present\r\ntorture, but chiefly by the pang that rankles after it. With almost a\r\nserene deportment, therefore, Hester Prynne passed through this\r\nportion of her ordeal, and came to a sort of scaffold, at the western\r\nextremity of the market-place. It stood nearly beneath the eaves of\r\nBoston’s earliest church, and appeared to be a fixture there.\r\n\r\nIn fact, this scaffold constituted a portion of a penal machine, which\r\nnow, for two or three generations past, has been merely historical and\r\ntraditionary among us, but was held, in the old time, to be as\r\neffectual an agent, in the promotion of good citizenship, as ever was\r\nthe guillotine among the terrorists of France. It was, in short, the\r\nplatform of the pillory; and above it rose the framework of that\r\ninstrument of discipline, so fashioned as to confine the human head in\r\nits tight grasp, and thus hold it up to the public gaze. The very\r\nideal of ignominy was embodied and made manifest in this contrivance\r\nof wood and iron. There can be no outrage, methinks, against our\r\ncommon nature,—whatever be the delinquencies of the individual,—no\r\noutrage more flagrant than to forbid the culprit to hide his face for\r\nshame; as it was the essence of this punishment to do. In Hester\r\nPrynne’s instance, however, as not unfrequently in other cases, her\r\nsentence bore, that she should stand a certain time upon the platform,\r\nbut without undergoing that gripe about the neck and confinement of\r\nthe head, the proneness to which was the most devilish characteristic\r\nof this ugly engine. Knowing well her part, she ascended a flight of\r\nwooden steps, and was thus displayed to the surrounding multitude, at\r\nabout the height of a man’s shoulders above the street.\r\n\r\nHad there been a Papist among the crowd of Puritans, he might have\r\nseen in this beautiful woman, so picturesque in her attire and mien,\r\nand with the infant at her bosom, an object to remind him of the image\r\nof Divine Maternity, which so many illustrious painters have vied with\r\none another to represent; something which should remind him, indeed,\r\nbut only by contrast, of that sacred image of sinless motherhood,\r\nwhose infant was to redeem the world. Here, there was the taint of\r\ndeepest sin in the most sacred quality of human life, working such\r\neffect, that the world was only the darker for this woman’s beauty,\r\nand the more lost for the infant that she had borne.\r\n\r\nThe scene was not without a mixture of awe, such as must always invest\r\nthe spectacle of guilt and shame in a fellow-creature, before society\r\nshall have grown corrupt enough to smile, instead of shuddering, at\r\nit. The witnesses of Hester Prynne’s disgrace had not yet passed\r\nbeyond their simplicity. They were stern enough to look upon her\r\ndeath, had that been the sentence, without a murmur at its severity,\r\nbut had none of the heartlessness of another social state, which would\r\nfind only a theme for jest in an exhibition like the present. Even had\r\nthere been a disposition to turn the matter into ridicule, it must\r\nhave been repressed and overpowered by the solemn presence of men no\r\nless dignified than the Governor, and several of his counsellors, a\r\njudge, a general, and the ministers of the town; all of whom sat or\r\nstood in a balcony of the meeting-house, looking down upon the\r\nplatform. When such personages could constitute a part of the\r\nspectacle, without risking the majesty or reverence of rank and\r\noffice, it was safely to be inferred that the infliction of a legal\r\nsentence would have an earnest and effectual meaning. Accordingly, the\r\ncrowd was sombre and grave. The unhappy culprit sustained herself as\r\nbest a woman might, under the heavy weight of a thousand unrelenting\r\neyes, all fastened upon her, and concentrated at her bosom. It was\r\nalmost intolerable to be borne. Of an impulsive and passionate nature,\r\nshe had fortified herself to encounter the stings and venomous stabs\r\nof public contumely, wreaking itself in every variety of insult; but\r\nthere was a quality so much more terrible in the solemn mood of the\r\npopular mind, that she longed rather to behold all those rigid\r\ncountenances contorted with scornful merriment, and herself the\r\nobject. Had a roar of laughter burst from the multitude,—each man,\r\neach woman, each little shrill-voiced child, contributing their\r\nindividual parts,—Hester Prynne might have repaid them all with a\r\nbitter and disdainful smile. But, under the leaden infliction which it\r\nwas her doom to endure, she felt, at moments, as if she must needs\r\nshriek out with the full power of her lungs, and cast herself from the\r\nscaffold down upon the ground, or else go mad at once.\r\n\r\nYet there were intervals when the whole scene, in which she was the\r\nmost conspicuous object, seemed to vanish from her eyes, or, at least,\r\nglimmered indistinctly before them, like a mass of imperfectly shaped\r\nand spectral images. Her mind, and especially her memory, was\r\npreternaturally active, and kept bringing up other scenes than this\r\nroughly hewn street of a little town, on the edge of the Western\r\nwilderness; other faces than were lowering upon her from beneath the\r\nbrims of those steeple-crowned hats. Reminiscences the most trifling\r\nand immaterial, passages of infancy and school-days, sports, childish\r\nquarrels, and the little domestic traits of her maiden years, came\r\nswarming back upon her, intermingled with recollections of whatever\r\nwas gravest in her subsequent life; one picture precisely as vivid as\r\nanother; as if all were of similar importance, or all alike a play.\r\nPossibly, it was an instinctive device of her spirit, to relieve\r\nitself, by the exhibition of these phantasmagoric forms, from the\r\ncruel weight and hardness of the reality.\r\n\r\nBe that as it might, the scaffold of the pillory was a point of view\r\nthat revealed to Hester Prynne the entire track along which she had\r\nbeen treading, since her happy infancy. Standing on that miserable\r\neminence, she saw again her native village, in Old England, and her\r\npaternal home; a decayed house of gray stone, with a poverty-stricken\r\naspect, but retaining a half-obliterated shield of arms over the\r\nportal, in token of antique gentility. She saw her father’s face, with\r\nits bald brow, and reverend white beard, that flowed over the\r\nold-fashioned Elizabethan ruff; her mother’s, too, with the look of\r\nheedful and anxious love which it always wore in her remembrance, and\r\nwhich, even since her death, had so often laid the impediment of a\r\ngentle remonstrance in her daughter’s pathway. She saw her own\r\nface, glowing with girlish beauty, and illuminating all the interior\r\nof the dusky mirror in which she had been wont to gaze at it. There\r\nshe beheld another countenance, of a man well stricken in years, a\r\npale, thin, scholar-like visage, with eyes dim and bleared by the\r\nlamplight that had served them to pore over many ponderous books. Yet\r\nthose same bleared optics had a strange, penetrating power, when it\r\nwas their owner’s purpose to read the human soul. This figure of the\r\nstudy and the cloister, as Hester Prynne’s womanly fancy failed not to\r\nrecall, was slightly deformed, with the left shoulder a trifle higher\r\nthan the right. Next rose before her, in memory’s picture-gallery, the\r\nintricate and narrow thoroughfares, the tall, gray houses, the huge\r\ncathedrals, and the public edifices, ancient in date and quaint in\r\narchitecture, of a Continental city; where a new life had awaited her,\r\nstill in connection with the misshapen scholar; a new life, but\r\nfeeding itself on time-worn materials, like a tuft of green moss on a\r\ncrumbling wall. Lastly, in lieu of these shifting scenes, came back\r\nthe rude market-place of the Puritan settlement, with all the\r\ntowns-people assembled and levelling their stern regards at Hester\r\nPrynne,—yes, at herself,—who stood on the scaffold of the pillory,\r\nan infant on her arm, and the letter A, in scarlet, fantastically\r\nembroidered with gold-thread, upon her bosom!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Standing on the Miserable Eminence”]\r\n\r\nCould it be true? She clutched the child so fiercely to her breast,\r\nthat it sent forth a cry; she turned her eyes downward at the scarlet\r\nletter, and even touched it with her finger, to assure herself that\r\nthe infant and the shame were real. Yes!—these were her\r\nrealities,—all else had vanished!\r\n\n [Illustration]"

      "content": "THE RECOGNITION.\r\n\nFrom this intense consciousness of being the object of severe and\r\nuniversal observation, the wearer of the scarlet letter was at length\r\nrelieved, by discerning, on the outskirts of the crowd, a figure which\r\nirresistibly took possession of her thoughts. An Indian, in his native\r\ngarb, was standing there; but the red men were not so infrequent\r\nvisitors of the English settlements, that one of them would have\r\nattracted any notice from Hester Prynne, at such a time; much less\r\nwould he have excluded all other objects and ideas from her mind. By\r\nthe Indian’s side, and evidently sustaining a companionship with him,\r\nstood a white man, clad in a strange disarray of civilized and savage\r\ncostume.\r\n\r\nHe was small in stature, with a furrowed visage, which, as yet, could\r\nhardly be termed aged. There was a remarkable intelligence in his\r\nfeatures, as of a person who had so cultivated his mental part that it\r\ncould not fail to mould the physical to itself, and become manifest by\r\nunmistakable tokens. Although, by a seemingly careless arrangement of\r\nhis heterogeneous garb, he had endeavored to conceal or abate the\r\npeculiarity, it was sufficiently evident to Hester Prynne, that one of\r\nthis man’s shoulders rose higher than the other. Again, at the first\r\ninstant of perceiving that thin visage, and the slight deformity of\r\nthe figure, she pressed her infant to her bosom with so convulsive a\r\nforce that the poor babe uttered another cry of pain. But the mother\r\ndid not seem to hear it.\r\n\r\nAt his arrival in the market-place, and some time before she saw him,\r\nthe stranger had bent his eyes on Hester Prynne. It was carelessly, at\r\nfirst, like a man chiefly accustomed to look inward, and to whom\r\nexternal matters are of little value and import, unless they bear\r\nrelation to something within his mind. Very soon, however, his look\r\nbecame keen and penetrative. A writhing horror twisted itself across\r\nhis features, like a snake gliding swiftly over them, and making one\r\nlittle pause, with all its wreathed intervolutions in open sight. His\r\nface darkened with some powerful emotion, which, nevertheless, he so\r\ninstantaneously controlled by an effort of his will, that, save at a\r\nsingle moment, its expression might have passed for calmness. After a\r\nbrief space, the convulsion grew almost imperceptible, and finally\r\nsubsided into the depths of his nature. When he found the eyes of\r\nHester Prynne fastened on his own, and saw that she appeared to\r\nrecognize him, he slowly and calmly raised his finger, made a gesture\r\nwith it in the air, and laid it on his lips.\r\n\r\nThen, touching the shoulder of a townsman who stood next to him, he\r\naddressed him, in a formal and courteous manner.\r\n\r\n“I pray you, good Sir,” said he, “who is this woman?—and wherefore is\r\nshe here set up to public shame?”\r\n\r\n“You must needs be a stranger in this region, friend,” answered the\r\ntownsman, looking curiously at the questioner and his savage\r\ncompanion, “else you would surely have heard of Mistress Hester\r\nPrynne, and her evil doings. She hath raised a great scandal, I\r\npromise you, in godly Master Dimmesdale’s church.”\r\n\r\n“You say truly,” replied the other. “I am a stranger, and have been a\r\nwanderer, sorely against my will. I have met with grievous mishaps by\r\nsea and land, and have been long held in bonds among the heathen-folk,\r\nto the southward; and am now brought hither by this Indian, to be\r\nredeemed out of my captivity. Will it please you, therefore, to tell\r\nme of Hester Prynne’s,—have I her name rightly?—of this woman’s\r\noffences, and what has brought her to yonder scaffold?”\r\n\r\n“Truly, friend; and methinks it must gladden your heart, after your\r\ntroubles and sojourn in the wilderness,” said the townsman, “to find\r\nyourself, at length, in a land where iniquity is searched out, and\r\npunished in the sight of rulers and people; as here in our godly New\r\nEngland. Yonder woman, Sir, you must know, was the wife of a certain\r\nlearned man, English by birth, but who had long dwelt in Amsterdam,\r\nwhence, some good time agone, he was minded to cross over and cast in\r\nhis lot with us of the Massachusetts. To this purpose, he sent his\r\nwife before him, remaining himself to look after some necessary\r\naffairs. Marry, good Sir, in some two years, or less, that the woman\r\nhas been a dweller here in Boston, no tidings have come of this\r\nlearned gentleman, Master Prynne; and his young wife, look you, being\r\nleft to her own misguidance—”\r\n\r\n“Ah!—aha!—I conceive you,” said the stranger, with a bitter smile.\r\n“So learned a man as you speak of should have learned this too in his\r\nbooks. And who, by your favor, Sir, may be the father of yonder\r\nbabe—it is some three or four months old, I should judge—which\r\nMistress Prynne is holding in her arms?”\r\n\r\n“Of a truth, friend, that matter remaineth a riddle; and the Daniel\r\nwho shall expound it is yet a-wanting,” answered the townsman. “Madam\r\nHester absolutely refuseth to speak, and the magistrates have laid\r\ntheir heads together in vain. Peradventure the guilty one stands\r\nlooking on at this sad spectacle, unknown of man, and forgetting that\r\nGod sees him.”\r\n\r\n“The learned man,” observed the stranger, with another smile, “should\r\ncome himself, to look into the mystery.”\r\n\r\n“It behooves him well, if he be still in life,” responded the\r\ntownsman. “Now, good Sir, our Massachusetts magistracy, bethinking\r\nthemselves that this woman is youthful and fair, and doubtless was\r\nstrongly tempted to her fall,—and that, moreover, as is most likely,\r\nher husband may be at the bottom of the sea,—they have not been bold\r\nto put in force the extremity of our righteous law against her. The\r\npenalty thereof is death. But in their great mercy and tenderness of\r\nheart, they have doomed Mistress Prynne to stand only a space of three\r\nhours on the platform of the pillory, and then and thereafter, for the\r\nremainder of her natural life, to wear a mark of shame upon her\r\nbosom.”\r\n\r\n“A wise sentence!” remarked the stranger, gravely bowing his head.\r\n“Thus she will be a living sermon against sin, until the ignominious\r\nletter be engraved upon her tombstone. It irks me, nevertheless, that\r\nthe partner of her iniquity should not, at least, stand on the\r\nscaffold by her side. But he will be known!—he will be known!—he\r\nwill be known!”\r\n\r\nHe bowed courteously to the communicative townsman, and, whispering a\r\nfew words to his Indian attendant, they both made their way through\r\nthe crowd.\r\n\r\nWhile this passed, Hester Prynne had been standing on her pedestal,\r\nstill with a fixed gaze towards the stranger; so fixed a gaze, that,\r\nat moments of intense absorption, all other objects in the visible\r\nworld seemed to vanish, leaving only him and her. Such an interview,\r\nperhaps, would have been more terrible than even to meet him as she\r\nnow did, with the hot, mid-day sun burning down upon her face, and\r\nlighting up its shame; with the scarlet token of infamy on her breast;\r\nwith the sin-born infant in her arms; with a whole people, drawn forth\r\nas to a festival, staring at the features that should have been seen\r\nonly in the quiet gleam of the fireside, in the happy shadow of a\r\nhome, or beneath a matronly veil, at church. Dreadful as it was, she\r\nwas conscious of a shelter in the presence of these thousand\r\nwitnesses. It was better to stand thus, with so many betwixt him and\r\nher, than to greet him, face to face, they two alone. She fled for\r\nrefuge, as it were, to the public exposure, and dreaded the moment\r\nwhen its protection should be withdrawn from her. Involved in these\r\nthoughts, she scarcely heard a voice behind her, until it had repeated\r\nher name more than once, in a loud and solemn tone, audible to the\r\nwhole multitude.\r\n\r\n“Hearken unto me, Hester Prynne!” said the voice.\r\n\r\nIt has already been noticed, that directly over the platform on which\r\nHester Prynne stood was a kind of balcony, or open gallery, appended\r\nto the meeting-house. It was the place whence proclamations were wont\r\nto be made, amidst an assemblage of the magistracy, with all the\r\nceremonial that attended such public observances in those days. Here,\r\nto witness the scene which we are describing, sat Governor Bellingham\r\nhimself, with four sergeants about his chair, bearing halberds, as a\r\nguard of honor. He wore a dark feather in his hat, a border of\r\nembroidery on his cloak, and a black velvet tunic beneath; a\r\ngentleman advanced in years, with a hard experience written in his\r\nwrinkles. He was not ill fitted to be the head and representative of a\r\ncommunity, which owed its origin and progress, and its present state\r\nof development, not to the impulses of youth, but to the stern and\r\ntempered energies of manhood, and the sombre sagacity of age;\r\naccomplishing so much, precisely because it imagined and hoped so\r\nlittle. The other eminent characters, by whom the chief ruler was\r\nsurrounded, were distinguished by a dignity of mien, belonging to a\r\nperiod when the forms of authority were felt to possess the sacredness\r\nof Divine institutions. They were, doubtless, good men, just and sage.\r\nBut, out of the whole human family, it would not have been easy to\r\nselect the same number of wise and virtuous persons, who should be\r\nless capable of sitting in judgment on an erring woman’s heart, and\r\ndisentangling its mesh of good and evil, than the sages of rigid\r\naspect towards whom Hester Prynne now turned her face. She seemed\r\nconscious, indeed, that whatever sympathy she might expect lay in the\r\nlarger and warmer heart of the multitude; for, as she lifted her eyes\r\ntowards the balcony, the unhappy woman grew pale and trembled.\r\n\r\nThe voice which had called her attention was that of the reverend and\r\nfamous John Wilson, the eldest clergyman of Boston, a great scholar,\r\nlike most of his contemporaries in the profession, and withal a man of\r\nkind and genial spirit. This last attribute, however, had been less\r\ncarefully developed than his intellectual gifts, and was, in truth,\r\nrather a matter of shame than self-congratulation with him. There he\r\nstood, with a border of grizzled locks beneath his skull-cap; while\r\nhis gray eyes, accustomed to the shaded light of his study, were\r\nwinking, like those of Hester’s infant, in the unadulterated\r\nsunshine. He looked like the darkly engraved portraits which we see\r\nprefixed to old volumes of sermons; and had no more right than one of\r\nthose portraits would have, to step forth, as he now did, and meddle\r\nwith a question of human guilt, passion, and anguish.\r\n\r\n“Hester Prynne,” said the clergyman, “I have striven with my young\r\nbrother here, under whose preaching of the word you have been\r\nprivileged to sit,”—here Mr. Wilson laid his hand on the shoulder of\r\na pale young man beside him,—“I have sought, I say, to persuade this\r\ngodly youth, that he should deal with you, here in the face of Heaven,\r\nand before these wise and upright rulers, and in hearing of all the\r\npeople, as touching the vileness and blackness of your sin. Knowing\r\nyour natural temper better than I, he could the better judge what\r\narguments to use, whether of tenderness or terror, such as might\r\nprevail over your hardness and obstinacy; insomuch that you should no\r\nlonger hide the name of him who tempted you to this grievous fall. But\r\nhe opposes to me (with a young man’s over-softness, albeit wise beyond\r\nhis years), that it were wronging the very nature of woman to force\r\nher to lay open her heart’s secrets in such broad daylight, and in\r\npresence of so great a multitude. Truly, as I sought to convince him,\r\nthe shame lay in the commission of the sin, and not in the showing of\r\nit forth. What say you to it, once again, Brother Dimmesdale? Must it\r\nbe thou, or I, that shall deal with this poor sinner’s soul?”\r\n\r\nThere was a murmur among the dignified and reverend occupants of the\r\nbalcony; and Governor Bellingham gave expression to its purport,\r\nspeaking in an authoritative voice, although tempered with respect\r\ntowards the youthful clergyman whom he addressed.\r\n\r\n“Good Master Dimmesdale,” said he, “the responsibility of this woman’s\r\nsoul lies greatly with you. It behooves you, therefore, to exhort her\r\nto repentance, and to confession, as a proof and consequence thereof.”\r\n\r\nThe directness of this appeal drew the eyes of the whole crowd upon\r\nthe Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale; a young clergyman, who had come from one\r\nof the great English universities, bringing all the learning of the\r\nage into our wild forest-land. His eloquence and religious fervor had\r\nalready given the earnest of high eminence in his profession. He was a\r\nperson of very striking aspect, with a white, lofty, and impending\r\nbrow, large brown, melancholy eyes, and a mouth which, unless when he\r\nforcibly compressed it, was apt to be tremulous, expressing both\r\nnervous sensibility and a vast power of self-restraint.\r\nNotwithstanding his high native gifts and scholar-like attainments,\r\nthere was an air about this young minister,—an apprehensive, a\r\nstartled, a half-frightened look,—as of a being who felt himself\r\nquite astray and at a loss in the pathway of human existence, and\r\ncould only be at ease in some seclusion of his own. Therefore, so far\r\nas his duties would permit, he trod in the shadowy by-paths, and thus\r\nkept himself simple and childlike; coming forth, when occasion was,\r\nwith a freshness, and fragrance, and dewy purity of thought, which, as\r\nmany people said, affected them like the speech of an angel.\r\n\r\nSuch was the young man whom the Reverend Mr. Wilson and the Governor\r\nhad introduced so openly to the public notice, bidding him speak, in\r\nthe hearing of all men, to that mystery of a woman’s soul, so sacred\r\neven in its pollution. The trying nature of his position drove the\r\nblood from his cheek, and made his lips tremulous.\r\n\r\n“Speak to the woman, my brother,” said Mr. Wilson. “It is of moment to\r\nher soul, and therefore, as the worshipful Governor says, momentous to\r\nthine own, in whose charge hers is. Exhort her to confess the truth!”\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale bent his head, in silent prayer, as it\r\nseemed, and then came forward.\r\n\r\n“Hester Prynne,” said he, leaning over the balcony and looking down\r\nsteadfastly into her eyes, “thou hearest what this good man says, and\r\nseest the accountability under which I labor. If thou feelest it to be\r\nfor thy soul’s peace, and that thy earthly punishment will thereby be\r\nmade more effectual to salvation, I charge thee to speak out the name\r\nof thy fellow-sinner and fellow-sufferer! Be not silent from any\r\nmistaken pity and tenderness for him; for, believe me, Hester, though\r\nhe were to step down from a high place, and stand there beside thee,\r\non thy pedestal of shame, yet better were it so than to hide a guilty\r\nheart through life. What can thy silence do for him, except it tempt\r\nhim—yea, compel him, as it were—to add hypocrisy to sin? Heaven hath\r\ngranted thee an open ignominy, that thereby thou mayest work out an\r\nopen triumph over the evil within thee, and the sorrow without. Take\r\nheed how thou deniest to him—who, perchance, hath not the courage to\r\ngrasp it for himself—the bitter, but wholesome, cup that is now\r\npresented to thy lips!”\r\n\r\nThe young pastor’s voice was tremulously sweet, rich, deep, and\r\nbroken. The feeling that it so evidently manifested, rather than the\r\ndirect purport of the words, caused it to vibrate within all hearts,\r\nand brought the listeners into one accord of sympathy. Even the poor\r\nbaby, at Hester’s bosom, was affected by the same influence; for it\r\ndirected its hitherto vacant gaze towards Mr. Dimmesdale, and held up\r\nits little arms, with a half-pleased, half-plaintive murmur. So\r\npowerful seemed the minister’s appeal, that the people could not\r\nbelieve but that Hester Prynne would speak out the guilty name; or\r\nelse that the guilty one himself, in whatever high or lowly place he\r\nstood, would be drawn forth by an inward and inevitable necessity, and\r\ncompelled to ascend to the scaffold.\r\n\r\nHester shook her head.\r\n\r\n“Woman, transgress not beyond the limits of Heaven’s mercy!” cried the\r\nReverend Mr. Wilson, more harshly than before. “That little babe hath\r\nbeen gifted with a voice, to second and confirm the counsel which thou\r\nhast heard. Speak out the name! That, and thy repentance, may avail to\r\ntake the scarlet letter off thy breast.”\r\n\r\n“Never!” replied Hester Prynne, looking, not at Mr. Wilson, but into\r\nthe deep and troubled eyes of the younger clergyman. “It is too deeply\r\nbranded. Ye cannot take it off. And would that I might endure his\r\nagony, as well as mine!”\r\n\r\n“Speak, woman!” said another voice, coldly and sternly, proceeding\r\nfrom the crowd about the scaffold. “Speak; and give your child a\r\nfather!”\r\n\r\n“I will not speak!” answered Hester, turning pale as death, but\r\nresponding to this voice, which she too surely recognized. “And my\r\nchild must seek a heavenly Father; she shall never know an earthly\r\none!”\r\n\r\n“She will not speak!” murmured Mr. Dimmesdale, who, leaning over the\r\nbalcony, with his hand upon his heart, had awaited the result of his\r\nappeal. He now drew back, with a long respiration. “Wondrous strength\r\nand generosity of a woman’s heart! She will not speak!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “She was led back to Prison”]\r\n\r\nDiscerning the impracticable state of the poor culprit’s mind, the\r\nelder clergyman, who had carefully prepared himself for the occasion,\r\naddressed to the multitude a discourse on sin, in all its branches,\r\nbut with continual reference to the ignominious letter. So forcibly\r\ndid he dwell upon this symbol, for the hour or more during which his\r\nperiods were rolling over the people’s heads, that it assumed new\r\nterrors in their imagination, and seemed to derive its scarlet hue\r\nfrom the flames of the infernal pit. Hester Prynne, meanwhile, kept\r\nher place upon the pedestal of shame, with glazed eyes, and an air of\r\nweary indifference. She had borne, that morning, all that nature could\r\nendure; and as her temperament was not of the order that escapes from\r\ntoo intense suffering by a swoon, her spirit could only shelter itself\r\nbeneath a stony crust of insensibility, while the faculties of animal\r\nlife remained entire. In this state, the voice of the preacher\r\nthundered remorselessly, but unavailingly, upon her ears. The infant,\r\nduring the latter portion of her ordeal, pierced the air with its\r\nwailings and screams; she strove to hush it, mechanically, but seemed\r\nscarcely to sympathize with its trouble. With the same hard demeanor,\r\nshe was led back to prison, and vanished from the public gaze within\r\nits iron-clamped portal. It was whispered, by those who peered after\r\nher, that the scarlet letter threw a lurid gleam along the dark\r\npassage-way of the interior.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\n [Illustration]"

      "content": "THE INTERVIEW.\r\n\nAfter her return to the prison, Hester Prynne was found to be in a\r\nstate of nervous excitement that demanded constant watchfulness, lest\r\nshe should perpetrate violence on herself, or do some half-frenzied\r\nmischief to the poor babe. As night approached, it proving impossible\r\nto quell her insubordination by rebuke or threats of punishment,\r\nMaster Brackett, the jailer, thought fit to introduce a physician. He\r\ndescribed him as a man of skill in all Christian modes of physical\r\nscience, and likewise familiar with whatever the savage people could\r\nteach, in respect to medicinal herbs and roots that grew in the\r\nforest. To say the truth, there was much need of professional\r\nassistance, not merely for Hester herself, but still more urgently for\r\nthe child; who, drawing its sustenance from the maternal bosom, seemed\r\nto have drank in with it all the turmoil, the anguish and despair,\r\nwhich pervaded the mother’s system. It now writhed in convulsions of\r\npain, and was a forcible type, in its little frame, of the moral agony\r\nwhich Hester Prynne had borne throughout the day.\r\n\r\nClosely following the jailer into the dismal apartment appeared that\r\nindividual, of singular aspect, whose presence in the crowd had been\r\nof such deep interest to the wearer of the scarlet letter. He was\r\nlodged in the prison, not as suspected of any offence, but as the most\r\nconvenient and suitable mode of disposing of him, until the\r\nmagistrates should have conferred with the Indian sagamores respecting\r\nhis ransom. His name was announced as Roger Chillingworth. The jailer,\r\nafter ushering him into the room, remained a moment, marvelling at the\r\ncomparative quiet that followed his entrance; for Hester Prynne had\r\nimmediately become as still as death, although the child continued to\r\nmoan.\r\n\r\n“Prithee, friend, leave me alone with my patient,” said the\r\npractitioner. “Trust me, good jailer, you shall briefly have peace in\r\nyour house; and, I promise you, Mistress Prynne shall hereafter be\r\nmore amenable to just authority than you may have found her\r\nheretofore.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, if your worship can accomplish that,” answered Master Brackett,\r\n“I shall own you for a man of skill indeed! Verily, the woman hath\r\nbeen like a possessed one; and there lacks little, that I should take\r\nin hand to drive Satan out of her with stripes.”\r\n\r\nThe stranger had entered the room with the characteristic quietude of\r\nthe profession to which he announced himself as belonging. Nor did his\r\ndemeanor change, when the withdrawal of the prison-keeper left him\r\nface to face with the woman, whose absorbed notice of him, in the\r\ncrowd, had intimated so close a relation between himself and her. His\r\nfirst care was given to the child; whose cries, indeed, as she lay\r\nwrithing on the trundle-bed, made it of peremptory necessity to\r\npostpone all other business to the task of soothing her. He examined\r\nthe infant carefully, and then proceeded to unclasp a leathern case,\r\nwhich he took from beneath his dress. It appeared to contain medical\r\npreparations, one of which he mingled with a cup of water.\r\n\r\n“My old studies in alchemy,” observed he, “and my sojourn, for above a\r\nyear past, among a people well versed in the kindly properties of\r\nsimples, have made a better physician of me than many that claim the\r\nmedical degree. Here, woman! The child is yours,—she is none of\r\nmine,—neither will she recognize my voice or aspect as a father’s.\r\nAdminister this draught, therefore, with thine own hand.”\r\n\r\nHester repelled the offered medicine, at the same time gazing with\r\nstrongly marked apprehension into his face.\r\n\r\n“Wouldst thou avenge thyself on the innocent babe?” whispered she.\r\n\r\n“Foolish woman!” responded the physician, half coldly, half\r\nsoothingly. “What should ail me, to harm this misbegotten and\r\nmiserable babe? The medicine is potent for good; and were it my\r\nchild,—yea, mine own, as well as thine!—I could do no better for\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nAs she still hesitated, being, in fact, in no reasonable state of\r\nmind, he took the infant in his arms, and himself administered the\r\ndraught. It soon proved its efficacy, and redeemed the leech’s pledge.\r\nThe moans of the little patient subsided; its convulsive tossings\r\ngradually ceased; and, in a few moments, as is the custom of young\r\nchildren after relief from pain, it sank into a profound and dewy\r\nslumber. The physician, as he had a fair right to be termed, next\r\nbestowed his attention on the mother. With calm and intent scrutiny he\r\nfelt her pulse, looked into her eyes,—a gaze that made her heart\r\nshrink and shudder, because so familiar, and yet so strange and\r\ncold,—and, finally, satisfied with his investigation, proceeded to\r\nmingle another draught.\r\n\r\n“I know not Lethe nor Nepenthe,” remarked he; “but I have learned many\r\nnew secrets in the wilderness, and here is one of them,—a recipe that\r\nan Indian taught me, in requital of some lessons of my own, that were\r\nas old as Paracelsus. Drink it! It may be less soothing than a sinless\r\nconscience. That I cannot give thee. But it will calm the swell and\r\nheaving of thy passion, like oil thrown on the waves of a tempestuous\r\nsea.”\r\n\r\nHe presented the cup to Hester, who received it with a slow, earnest\r\nlook into his face; not precisely a look of fear, yet full of doubt\r\nand questioning, as to what his purposes might be. She looked also at\r\nher slumbering child.\r\n\r\n“I have thought of death,” said she,—“have wished for it,—would even\r\nhave prayed for it, were it fit that such as I should pray for\r\nanything. Yet if death be in this cup, I bid thee think again, ere\r\nthou beholdest me quaff it. See! It is even now at my lips.”\r\n\r\n“Drink, then,” replied he, still with the same cold composure. “Dost\r\nthou know me so little, Hester Prynne? Are my purposes wont to be so\r\nshallow? Even if I imagine a scheme of vengeance, what could I do\r\nbetter for my object than to let thee live,—than to give thee\r\nmedicines against all harm and peril of life,—so that this burning\r\nshame may still blaze upon thy bosom?” As he spoke, he laid his long\r\nforefinger on the scarlet letter, which forthwith seemed to scorch\r\ninto Hester’s breast, as if it had been red-hot. He noticed her\r\ninvoluntary gesture, and smiled. “Live, therefore, and bear about thy\r\ndoom with thee, in the eyes of men and women,—in the eyes of him whom\r\nthou didst call thy husband,—in the eyes of yonder child! And, that\r\nthou mayest live, take off this draught.”\r\n\r\nWithout further expostulation or delay, Hester Prynne drained the\r\ncup, and, at the motion of the man of skill, seated herself on the bed\r\nwhere the child was sleeping; while he drew the only chair which the\r\nroom afforded, and took his own seat beside her. She could not but\r\ntremble at these preparations; for she felt that—having now done all\r\nthat humanity or principle, or, if so it were, a refined cruelty,\r\nimpelled him to do, for the relief of physical suffering—he was next\r\nto treat with her as the man whom she had most deeply and irreparably\r\ninjured.\r\n\r\n“Hester,” said he, “I ask not wherefore, nor how, thou hast fallen\r\ninto the pit, or say, rather, thou hast ascended to the pedestal of\r\ninfamy, on which I found thee. The reason is not far to seek. It was\r\nmy folly, and thy weakness. I,—a man of thought,—the bookworm of\r\ngreat libraries,—a man already in decay, having given my best years\r\nto feed the hungry dream of knowledge,—what had I to do with youth\r\nand beauty like thine own! Misshapen from my birth-hour, how could I\r\ndelude myself with the idea that intellectual gifts might veil\r\nphysical deformity in a young girl’s fantasy! Men call me wise. If\r\nsages were ever wise in their own behoof, I might have foreseen all\r\nthis. I might have known that, as I came out of the vast and dismal\r\nforest, and entered this settlement of Christian men, the very first\r\nobject to meet my eyes would be thyself, Hester Prynne, standing up, a\r\nstatue of ignominy, before the people. Nay, from the moment when we\r\ncame down the old church steps together, a married pair, I might have\r\nbeheld the bale-fire of that scarlet letter blazing at the end of our\r\npath!”\r\n\r\n“Thou knowest,” said Hester,—for, depressed as she was, she could not\r\nendure this last quiet stab at the token of her shame,—“thou knowest\r\nthat I was frank with thee. I felt no love, nor feigned any.”\r\n\r\n“True,” replied he. “It was my folly! I have said it. But, up to that\r\nepoch of my life, I had lived in vain. The world had been so\r\ncheerless! My heart was a habitation large enough for many guests, but\r\nlonely and chill, and without a household fire. I longed to kindle\r\none! It seemed not so wild a dream,—old as I was, and sombre as I\r\nwas, and misshapen as I was,—that the simple bliss, which is\r\nscattered far and wide, for all mankind to gather up, might yet be\r\nmine. And so, Hester, I drew thee into my heart, into its innermost\r\nchamber, and sought to warm thee by the warmth which thy presence made\r\nthere!”\r\n\r\n“I have greatly wronged thee,” murmured Hester.\r\n\r\n“We have wronged each other,” answered he. “Mine was the first wrong,\r\nwhen I betrayed thy budding youth into a false and unnatural relation\r\nwith my decay. Therefore, as a man who has not thought and\r\nphilosophized in vain, I seek no vengeance, plot no evil against thee.\r\nBetween thee and me the scale hangs fairly balanced. But, Hester, the\r\nman lives who has wronged us both! Who is he?”\r\n\r\n“Ask me not!” replied Hester Prynne, looking firmly into his face.\r\n“That thou shalt never know!”\r\n\r\n“Never, sayest thou?” rejoined he, with a smile of dark and\r\nself-relying intelligence. “Never know him! Believe me, Hester, there\r\nare few things,—whether in the outward world, or, to a certain depth,\r\nin the invisible sphere of thought,—few things hidden from the man\r\nwho devotes himself earnestly and unreservedly to the solution of a\r\nmystery. Thou mayest cover up thy secret from the prying multitude.\r\nThou mayest conceal it, too, from the ministers and magistrates, even\r\nas thou didst this day, when they sought to wrench the name out of thy\r\nheart, and give thee a partner on thy pedestal. But, as for me, I come\r\nto the inquest with other senses than they possess. I shall seek this\r\nman, as I have sought truth in books; as I have sought gold in\r\nalchemy. There is a sympathy that will make me conscious of him. I\r\nshall see him tremble. I shall feel myself shudder, suddenly and\r\nunawares. Sooner or later, he must needs be mine!”\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the wrinkled scholar glowed so intensely upon her, that\r\nHester Prynne clasped her hands over her heart, dreading lest he\r\nshould read the secret there at once.\r\n\r\n“Thou wilt not reveal his name? Not the less he is mine,” resumed he,\r\nwith a look of confidence, as if destiny were at one with him. “He\r\nbears no letter of infamy wrought into his garment, as thou dost; but\r\nI shall read it on his heart. Yet fear not for him! Think not that I\r\nshall interfere with Heaven’s own method of retribution, or, to my own\r\nloss, betray him to the gripe of human law. Neither do thou imagine\r\nthat I shall contrive aught against his life; no, nor against his\r\nfame, if, as I judge, he be a man of fair repute. Let him live! Let\r\nhim hide himself in outward honor, if he may! Not the less he shall be\r\nmine!”\r\n\r\n“Thy acts are like mercy,” said Hester, bewildered and appalled. “But\r\nthy words interpret thee as a terror!”\r\n\r\n“One thing, thou that wast my wife, I would enjoin upon thee,”\r\ncontinued the scholar. “Thou hast kept the secret of thy paramour.\r\nKeep, likewise, mine! There are none in this land that know me.\r\nBreathe not, to any human soul, that thou didst ever call me husband!\r\nHere, on this wild outskirt of the earth, I shall pitch my tent; for,\r\nelsewhere a wanderer, and isolated from human interests, I find here a\r\nwoman, a man, a child, amongst whom and myself there exist the closest\r\nligaments. No matter whether of love or hate; no matter whether of\r\nright or wrong! Thou and thine, Hester Prynne, belong to me. My home\r\nis where thou art, and where he is. But betray me not!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “The Eyes of the wrinkled Scholar glowed”]\r\n\r\n“Wherefore dost thou desire it?” inquired Hester, shrinking, she\r\nhardly knew why, from this secret bond. “Why not announce thyself\r\nopenly, and cast me off at once?”\r\n\r\n“It may be,” he replied, “because I will not encounter the dishonor\r\nthat besmirches the husband of a faithless woman. It may be for other\r\nreasons. Enough, it is my purpose to live and die unknown. Let,\r\ntherefore, thy husband be to the world as one already dead, and of\r\nwhom no tidings shall ever come. Recognize me not, by word, by sign,\r\nby look! Breathe not the secret, above all, to the man thou wottest\r\nof. Shouldst thou fail me in this, beware! His fame, his position, his\r\nlife, will be in my hands. Beware!”\r\n\r\n“I will keep thy secret, as I have his,” said Hester.\r\n\r\n“Swear it!” rejoined he.\r\n\r\nAnd she took the oath.\r\n\r\n“And now, Mistress Prynne,” said old Roger Chillingworth, as he was\r\nhereafter to be named, “I leave thee alone; alone with thy infant, and\r\nthe scarlet letter! How is it, Hester? Doth thy sentence bind thee to\r\nwear the token in thy sleep? Art thou not afraid of nightmares and\r\nhideous dreams?”\r\n\r\n“Why dost thou smile so at me?” inquired Hester, troubled at the\r\nexpression of his eyes. “Art thou like the Black Man that haunts the\r\nforest round about us? Hast thou enticed me into a bond that will\r\nprove the ruin of my soul?”\r\n\r\n“Not thy soul,” he answered, with another smile. “No, not thine!”\r\n\n [Illustration]"

      "content": "HESTER AT HER NEEDLE.\r\n\nHester Prynne’s term of confinement was now at an end. Her prison-door\r\nwas thrown open, and she came forth into the sunshine, which, falling\r\non all alike, seemed, to her sick and morbid heart, as if meant for no\r\nother purpose than to reveal the scarlet letter on her breast. Perhaps\r\nthere was a more real torture in her first unattended footsteps from\r\nthe threshold of the prison, than even in the procession and spectacle\r\nthat have been described, where she was made the common infamy, at\r\nwhich all mankind was summoned to point its finger. Then, she was\r\nsupported by an unnatural tension of the nerves, and by all the\r\ncombative energy of her character, which enabled her to convert the\r\nscene into a kind of lurid triumph. It was, moreover, a separate and\r\ninsulated event, to occur but once in her lifetime, and to meet which,\r\ntherefore, reckless of economy, she might call up the vital strength\r\nthat would have sufficed for many quiet years. The very law that\r\ncondemned her—a giant of stern features, but with vigor to support,\r\nas well as to annihilate, in his iron arm—had held her up, through\r\nthe terrible ordeal of her ignominy. But now, with this unattended\r\nwalk from her prison-door, began the daily custom; and she must either\r\nsustain and carry it forward by the ordinary resources of her nature,\r\nor sink beneath it. She could no longer borrow from the future to help\r\nher through the present grief. To-morrow would bring its own trial\r\nwith it; so would the next day, and so would the next; each its own\r\ntrial, and yet the very same that was now so unutterably grievous to\r\nbe borne. The days of the far-off future would toil onward, still with\r\nthe same burden for her to take up, and bear along with her, but never\r\nto fling down; for the accumulating days, and added years, would pile\r\nup their misery upon the heap of shame. Throughout them all, giving up\r\nher individuality, she would become the general symbol at which the\r\npreacher and moralist might point, and in which they might vivify and\r\nembody their images of woman’s frailty and sinful passion. Thus the\r\nyoung and pure would be taught to look at her, with the scarlet letter\r\nflaming on her breast,—at her, the child of honorable parents,—at\r\nher, the mother of a babe, that would hereafter be a woman,—at her,\r\nwho had once been innocent,—as the figure, the body, the reality of\r\nsin. And over her grave, the infamy that she must carry thither would\r\nbe her only monument.\r\n\r\nIt may seem marvellous, that, with the world before her,—kept by no\r\nrestrictive clause of her condemnation within the limits of the\r\nPuritan settlement, so remote and so obscure,—free to return to her\r\nbirthplace, or to any other European land, and there hide her\r\ncharacter and identity under a new exterior, as completely as if\r\nemerging into another state of being,—and having also the passes of\r\nthe dark, inscrutable forest open to her, where the wildness of her\r\nnature might assimilate itself with a people whose customs and life\r\nwere alien from the law that had condemned her,—it may seem\r\nmarvellous, that this woman should still call that place her home,\r\nwhere, and where only, she must needs be the type of shame. But there\r\nis a fatality, a feeling so irresistible and inevitable that it has\r\nthe force of doom, which almost invariably compels human beings to\r\nlinger around and haunt, ghost-like, the spot where some great and\r\nmarked event has given the color to their lifetime; and still the more\r\nirresistibly, the darker the tinge that saddens it. Her sin, her\r\nignominy, were the roots which she had struck into the soil. It was as\r\nif a new birth, with stronger assimilations than the first, had\r\nconverted the forest-land, still so uncongenial to every other pilgrim\r\nand wanderer, into Hester Prynne’s wild and dreary, but life-long\r\nhome. All other scenes of earth—even that village of rural England,\r\nwhere happy infancy and stainless maidenhood seemed yet to be in her\r\nmother’s keeping, like garments put off long ago—were foreign to her,\r\nin comparison. The chain that bound her here was of iron links, and\r\ngalling to her inmost soul, but could never be broken.\r\n\r\nIt might be, too,—doubtless it was so, although she hid the secret\r\nfrom herself, and grew pale whenever it struggled out of her heart,\r\nlike a serpent from its hole,—it might be that another feeling kept\r\nher within the scene and pathway that had been so fatal. There dwelt,\r\nthere trode the feet of one with whom she deemed herself connected in\r\na union, that, unrecognized on earth, would bring them together before\r\nthe bar of final judgment, and make that their marriage-altar, for a\r\njoint futurity of endless retribution. Over and over again, the\r\ntempter of souls had thrust this idea upon Hester’s contemplation, and\r\nlaughed at the passionate and desperate joy with which she seized,\r\nand then strove to cast it from her. She barely looked the idea in the\r\nface, and hastened to bar it in its dungeon. What she compelled\r\nherself to believe—what, finally, she reasoned upon, as her motive\r\nfor continuing a resident of New England—was half a truth, and half a\r\nself-delusion. Here, she said to herself, had been the scene of her\r\nguilt, and here should be the scene of her earthly punishment; and so,\r\nperchance, the torture of her daily shame would at length purge her\r\nsoul, and work out another purity than that which she had lost; more\r\nsaint-like, because the result of martyrdom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Lonesome Dwelling]\r\n\r\nHester Prynne, therefore, did not flee. On the outskirts of the town,\r\nwithin the verge of the peninsula, but not in close vicinity to any\r\nother habitation, there was a small thatched cottage. It had been\r\nbuilt by an earlier settler, and abandoned because the soil about it\r\nwas too sterile for cultivation, while its comparative remoteness put\r\nit out of the sphere of that social activity which already marked the\r\nhabits of the emigrants. It stood on the shore, looking across a basin\r\nof the sea at the forest-covered hills, towards the west. A clump of\r\nscrubby trees, such as alone grew on the peninsula, did not so much\r\nconceal the cottage from view, as seem to denote that here was some\r\nobject which would fain have been, or at least ought to be, concealed.\r\nIn this little, lonesome dwelling, with some slender means that she\r\npossessed, and by the license of the magistrates, who still kept an\r\ninquisitorial watch over her, Hester established herself, with her\r\ninfant child. A mystic shadow of suspicion immediately attached itself\r\nto the spot. Children, too young to comprehend wherefore this woman\r\nshould be shut out from the sphere of human charities, would creep\r\nnigh enough to behold her plying her needle at the cottage-window, or\r\nstanding in the doorway, or laboring in her little garden, or coming\r\nforth along the pathway that led townward; and, discerning the scarlet\r\nletter on her breast, would scamper off with a strange, contagious\r\nfear.\r\n\r\nLonely as was Hester’s situation, and without a friend on earth who\r\ndared to show himself, she, however, incurred no risk of want. She\r\npossessed an art that sufficed, even in a land that afforded\r\ncomparatively little scope for its exercise, to supply food for her\r\nthriving infant and herself. It was the art—then, as now, almost the\r\nonly one within a woman’s grasp—of needlework. She bore on her\r\nbreast, in the curiously embroidered letter, a specimen of her\r\ndelicate and imaginative skill, of which the dames of a court might\r\ngladly have availed themselves, to add the richer and more spiritual\r\nadornment of human ingenuity to their fabrics of silk and gold. Here,\r\nindeed, in the sable simplicity that generally characterized the\r\nPuritanic modes of dress, there might be an infrequent call for the\r\nfiner productions of her handiwork. Yet the taste of the age,\r\ndemanding whatever was elaborate in compositions of this kind, did not\r\nfail to extend its influence over our stern progenitors, who had cast\r\nbehind them so many fashions which it might seem harder to dispense\r\nwith. Public ceremonies, such as ordinations, the installation of\r\nmagistrates, and all that could give majesty to the forms in which a\r\nnew government manifested itself to the people, were, as a matter of\r\npolicy, marked by a stately and well-conducted ceremonial, and a\r\nsombre, but yet a studied magnificence. Deep ruffs, painfully wrought\r\nbands, and gorgeously embroidered gloves, were all deemed necessary to\r\nthe official state of men assuming the reins of power; and were\r\nreadily allowed to individuals dignified by rank or wealth, even while\r\nsumptuary laws forbade these and similar extravagances to the plebeian\r\norder. In the array of funerals, too,—whether for the apparel of the\r\ndead body, or to typify, by manifold emblematic devices of sable cloth\r\nand snowy lawn, the sorrow of the survivors,—there was a frequent and\r\ncharacteristic demand for such labor as Hester Prynne could supply.\r\nBaby-linen—for babies then wore robes of state—afforded still\r\nanother possibility of toil and emolument.\r\n\r\nBy degrees, nor very slowly, her handiwork became what would now be\r\ntermed the fashion. Whether from commiseration for a woman of so\r\nmiserable a destiny; or from the morbid curiosity that gives a\r\nfictitious value even to common or worthless things; or by whatever\r\nother intangible circumstance was then, as now, sufficient to bestow,\r\non some persons, what others might seek in vain; or because Hester\r\nreally filled a gap which must otherwise have remained vacant; it is\r\ncertain that she had ready and fairly requited employment for as many\r\nhours as she saw fit to occupy with her needle. Vanity, it may be,\r\nchose to mortify itself, by putting on, for ceremonials of pomp and\r\nstate, the garments that had been wrought by her sinful hands. Her\r\nneedlework was seen on the ruff of the Governor; military men wore it\r\non their scarfs, and the minister on his band; it decked the baby’s\r\nlittle cap; it was shut up, to be mildewed and moulder away, in the\r\ncoffins of the dead. But it is not recorded that, in a single\r\ninstance, her skill was called in aid to embroider the white veil\r\nwhich was to cover the pure blushes of a bride. The exception\r\nindicated the ever-relentless rigor with which society frowned upon\r\nher sin.\r\n\r\nHester sought not to acquire anything beyond a subsistence, of the\r\nplainest and most ascetic description, for herself, and a simple\r\nabundance for her child. Her own dress was of the coarsest materials\r\nand the most sombre hue; with only that one ornament,—the scarlet\r\nletter,—which it was her doom to wear. The child’s attire, on the\r\nother hand, was distinguished by a fanciful, or, we might rather say,\r\na fantastic ingenuity, which served, indeed, to heighten the airy\r\ncharm that early began to develop itself in the little girl, but which\r\nappeared to have also a deeper meaning. We may speak further of it\r\nhereafter. Except for that small expenditure in the decoration of her\r\ninfant, Hester bestowed all her superfluous means in charity, on\r\nwretches less miserable than herself, and who not unfrequently\r\ninsulted the hand that fed them. Much of the time, which she might\r\nreadily have applied to the better efforts of her art, she employed in\r\nmaking coarse garments for the poor. It is probable that there was an\r\nidea of penance in this mode of occupation, and that she offered up a\r\nreal sacrifice of enjoyment, in devoting so many hours to such rude\r\nhandiwork. She had in her nature a rich, voluptuous, Oriental\r\ncharacteristic,—a taste for the gorgeously beautiful, which, save in\r\nthe exquisite productions of her needle, found nothing else, in all\r\nthe possibilities of her life, to exercise itself upon. Women derive\r\na pleasure, incomprehensible to the other sex, from the delicate toil\r\nof the needle. To Hester Prynne it might have been a mode of\r\nexpressing, and therefore soothing, the passion of her life. Like all\r\nother joys, she rejected it as sin. This morbid meddling of conscience\r\nwith an immaterial matter betokened, it is to be feared, no genuine\r\nand steadfast penitence, but something doubtful, something that might\r\nbe deeply wrong, beneath.\r\n\r\nIn this manner, Hester Prynne came to have a part to perform in the\r\nworld. With her native energy of character, and rare capacity, it\r\ncould not entirely cast her off, although it had set a mark upon her,\r\nmore intolerable to a woman’s heart than that which branded the brow\r\nof Cain. In all her intercourse with society, however, there was\r\nnothing that made her feel as if she belonged to it. Every gesture,\r\nevery word, and even the silence of those with whom she came in\r\ncontact, implied, and often expressed, that she was banished, and as\r\nmuch alone as if she inhabited another sphere, or communicated with\r\nthe common nature by other organs and senses than the rest of human\r\nkind. She stood apart from moral interests, yet close beside them,\r\nlike a ghost that revisits the familiar fireside, and can no longer\r\nmake itself seen or felt; no more smile with the household joy, nor\r\nmourn with the kindred sorrow; or, should it succeed in manifesting\r\nits forbidden sympathy, awakening only terror and horrible repugnance.\r\nThese emotions, in fact, and its bitterest scorn besides, seemed to be\r\nthe sole portion that she retained in the universal heart. It was not\r\nan age of delicacy; and her position, although she understood it well,\r\nand was in little danger of forgetting it, was often brought before\r\nher vivid self-perception, like a new anguish, by the rudest touch\r\nupon the tenderest spot. The poor, as we have already said, whom she\r\nsought out to be the objects of her bounty, often reviled the hand\r\nthat was stretched forth to succor them. Dames of elevated rank,\r\nlikewise, whose doors she entered in the way of her occupation, were\r\naccustomed to distil drops of bitterness into her heart; sometimes\r\nthrough that alchemy of quiet malice, by which women can concoct a\r\nsubtle poison from ordinary trifles; and sometimes, also, by a coarser\r\nexpression, that fell upon the sufferer’s defenceless breast like a\r\nrough blow upon an ulcerated wound. Hester had schooled herself long\r\nand well; she never responded to these attacks, save by a flush of\r\ncrimson that rose irrepressibly over her pale cheek, and again\r\nsubsided into the depths of her bosom. She was patient,—a martyr,\r\nindeed,—but she forbore to pray for her enemies; lest, in spite of\r\nher forgiving aspirations, the words of the blessing should stubbornly\r\ntwist themselves into a curse.\r\n\r\nContinually, and in a thousand other ways, did she feel the\r\ninnumerable throbs of anguish that had been so cunningly contrived for\r\nher by the undying, the ever-active sentence of the Puritan tribunal.\r\nClergymen paused in the street to address words of exhortation, that\r\nbrought a crowd, with its mingled grin and frown, around the poor,\r\nsinful woman. If she entered a church, trusting to share the Sabbath\r\nsmile of the Universal Father, it was often her mishap to find herself\r\nthe text of the discourse. She grew to have a dread of children; for\r\nthey had imbibed from their parents a vague idea of something horrible\r\nin this dreary woman, gliding silently through the town, with never\r\nany companion but one only child. Therefore, first allowing her to\r\npass, they pursued her at a distance with shrill cries, and the\r\nutterance of a word that had no distinct purport to their own\r\nminds, but was none the less terrible to her, as proceeding from lips\r\nthat babbled it unconsciously. It seemed to argue so wide a diffusion\r\nof her shame, that all nature knew of it; it could have caused her no\r\ndeeper pang, had the leaves of the trees whispered the dark story\r\namong themselves,—had the summer breeze murmured about it,—had the\r\nwintry blast shrieked it aloud! Another peculiar torture was felt in\r\nthe gaze of a new eye. When strangers looked curiously at the scarlet\r\nletter,—and none ever failed to do so,—they branded it afresh into\r\nHester’s soul; so that, oftentimes, she could scarcely refrain, yet\r\nalways did refrain, from covering the symbol with her hand. But then,\r\nagain, an accustomed eye had likewise its own anguish to inflict. Its\r\ncool stare of familiarity was intolerable. From first to last, in\r\nshort, Hester Prynne had always this dreadful agony in feeling a human\r\neye upon the token; the spot never grew callous; it seemed, on the\r\ncontrary, to grow more sensitive with daily torture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lonely Footsteps]\r\n\r\nBut sometimes, once in many days, or perchance in many months, she\r\nfelt an eye—a human eye—upon the ignominious brand, that seemed to\r\ngive a momentary relief, as if half of her agony were shared. The next\r\ninstant, back it all rushed again, with still a deeper throb of pain;\r\nfor, in that brief interval, she had sinned anew. Had Hester sinned\r\nalone?\r\n\r\nHer imagination was somewhat affected, and, had she been of a softer\r\nmoral and intellectual fibre, would have been still more so, by the\r\nstrange and solitary anguish of her life. Walking to and fro, with\r\nthose lonely footsteps, in the little world with which she was\r\noutwardly connected, it now and then appeared to Hester,—if\r\naltogether fancy, it was nevertheless too potent to be resisted,—she\r\nfelt or fancied, then, that the scarlet letter had endowed her with a\r\nnew sense. She shuddered to believe, yet could not help believing,\r\nthat it gave her a sympathetic knowledge of the hidden sin in other\r\nhearts. She was terror-stricken by the revelations that were thus\r\nmade. What were they? Could they be other than the insidious whispers\r\nof the bad angel, who would fain have persuaded the struggling woman,\r\nas yet only half his victim, that the outward guise of purity was but\r\na lie, and that, if truth were everywhere to be shown, a scarlet\r\nletter would blaze forth on many a bosom besides Hester Prynne’s? Or,\r\nmust she receive those intimations—so obscure, yet so distinct—as\r\ntruth? In all her miserable experience, there was nothing else so\r\nawful and so loathsome as this sense. It perplexed, as well as shocked\r\nher, by the irreverent inopportuneness of the occasions that brought\r\nit into vivid action. Sometimes the red infamy upon her breast would\r\ngive a sympathetic throb, as she passed near a venerable minister or\r\nmagistrate, the model of piety and justice, to whom that age of\r\nantique reverence looked up, as to a mortal man in fellowship with\r\nangels. “What evil thing is at hand?” would Hester say to herself.\r\nLifting her reluctant eyes, there would be nothing human within the\r\nscope of view, save the form of this earthly saint! Again, a mystic\r\nsisterhood would contumaciously assert itself, as she met the\r\nsanctified frown of some matron, who, according to the rumor of all\r\ntongues, had kept cold snow within her bosom throughout life. That\r\nunsunned snow in the matron’s bosom, and the burning shame on Hester\r\nPrynne’s,—what had the two in common? Or, once more, the electric\r\nthrill would give her warning,—“Behold, Hester, here is a\r\ncompanion!”—and, looking up, she would detect the eyes of a young\r\nmaiden glancing at the scarlet letter, shyly and aside, and quickly\r\naverted with a faint, chill crimson in her cheeks; as if her purity\r\nwere somewhat sullied by that momentary glance. O Fiend, whose\r\ntalisman was that fatal symbol, wouldst thou leave nothing, whether in\r\nyouth or age, for this poor sinner to revere?—such loss of faith is\r\never one of the saddest results of sin. Be it accepted as a proof that\r\nall was not corrupt in this poor victim of her own frailty, and man’s\r\nhard law, that Hester Prynne yet struggled to believe that no\r\nfellow-mortal was guilty like herself.\r\n\r\nThe vulgar, who, in those dreary old times, were always contributing a\r\ngrotesque horror to what interested their imaginations, had a story\r\nabout the scarlet letter which we might readily work up into a\r\nterrific legend. They averred, that the symbol was not mere scarlet\r\ncloth, tinged in an earthly dye-pot, but was red-hot with infernal\r\nfire, and could be seen glowing all alight, whenever Hester Prynne\r\nwalked abroad in the night-time. And we must needs say, it seared\r\nHester’s bosom so deeply, that perhaps there was more truth in the\r\nrumor than our modern incredulity may be inclined to admit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\n [Illustration]"

      "content": "PEARL.\r\n\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe have as yet hardly spoken of the infant; that little creature,\r\nwhose innocent life had sprung, by the inscrutable decree of\r\nProvidence, a lovely and immortal flower, out of the rank luxuriance\r\nof a guilty passion. How strange it seemed to the sad woman, as she\r\nwatched the growth, and the beauty that became every day more\r\nbrilliant, and the intelligence that threw its quivering sunshine over\r\nthe tiny features of this child! Her Pearl!—For so had Hester called\r\nher; not as a name expressive of her aspect, which had nothing of the\r\ncalm, white, unimpassioned lustre that would be indicated by the\r\ncomparison. But she named the infant “Pearl,” as being of great\r\nprice,—purchased with all she had,—her mother’s only treasure! How\r\nstrange, indeed! Man had marked this woman’s sin by a scarlet letter,\r\nwhich had such potent and disastrous efficacy that no human sympathy\r\ncould reach her, save it were sinful like herself. God, as a direct\r\nconsequence of the sin which man thus punished, had given her a lovely\r\nchild, whose place was on that same dishonored bosom, to connect her\r\nparent forever with the race and descent of mortals, and to be finally\r\na blessed soul in heaven! Yet these thoughts affected Hester Prynne\r\nless with hope than apprehension. She knew that her deed had been\r\nevil; she could have no faith, therefore, that its result would be\r\ngood. Day after day, she looked fearfully into the child’s expanding\r\nnature, ever dreading to detect some dark and wild peculiarity, that\r\nshould correspond with the guiltiness to which she owed her being.\r\n\r\nCertainly, there was no physical defect. By its perfect shape, its\r\nvigor, and its natural dexterity in the use of all its untried limbs,\r\nthe infant was worthy to have been brought forth in Eden; worthy to\r\nhave been left there, to be the plaything of the angels, after the\r\nworld’s first parents were driven out. The child had a native grace\r\nwhich does not invariably coexist with faultless beauty; its attire,\r\nhowever simple, always impressed the beholder as if it were the very\r\ngarb that precisely became it best. But little Pearl was not clad in\r\nrustic weeds. Her mother, with a morbid purpose that may be better\r\nunderstood hereafter, had bought the richest tissues that could be\r\nprocured, and allowed her imaginative faculty its full play in the\r\narrangement and decoration of the dresses which the child wore, before\r\nthe public eye. So magnificent was the small figure, when thus\r\narrayed, and such was the splendor of Pearl’s own proper beauty,\r\nshining through the gorgeous robes which might have extinguished a\r\npaler loveliness, that there was an absolute circle of radiance around\r\nher, on the darksome cottage floor. And yet a russet gown, torn and\r\nsoiled with the child’s rude play, made a picture of her just as\r\nperfect. Pearl’s aspect was imbued with a spell of infinite variety;\r\nin this one child there were many children, comprehending the full\r\nscope between the wild-flower prettiness of a peasant-baby, and the\r\npomp, in little, of an infant princess. Throughout all, however, there\r\nwas a trait of passion, a certain depth of hue, which she never lost;\r\nand if, in any of her changes, she had grown fainter or paler, she\r\nwould have ceased to be herself,—it would have been no longer Pearl!\r\n\r\nThis outward mutability indicated, and did not more than fairly\r\nexpress, the various properties of her inner life. Her nature appeared\r\nto possess depth, too, as well as variety; but—or else Hester’s fears\r\ndeceived her—it lacked reference and adaptation to the world into\r\nwhich she was born. The child could not be made amenable to rules. In\r\ngiving her existence, a great law had been broken; and the result was\r\na being whose elements were perhaps beautiful and brilliant, but all\r\nin disorder; or with an order peculiar to themselves, amidst which the\r\npoint of variety and arrangement was difficult or impossible to be\r\ndiscovered. Hester could only account for the child’s character—and\r\neven then most vaguely and imperfectly—by recalling what she herself\r\nhad been, during that momentous period while Pearl was imbibing her\r\nsoul from the spiritual world, and her bodily frame from its material\r\nof earth. The mother’s impassioned state had been the medium through\r\nwhich were transmitted to the unborn infant the rays of its moral\r\nlife; and, however white and clear originally, they had taken the deep\r\nstains of crimson and gold, the fiery lustre, the black shadow, and\r\nthe untempered light of the intervening substance. Above all, the\r\nwarfare of Hester’s spirit, at that epoch, was perpetuated in Pearl.\r\nShe could recognize her wild, desperate, defiant mood, the flightiness\r\nof her temper, and even some of the very cloud-shapes of gloom and\r\ndespondency that had brooded in her heart. They were now illuminated\r\nby the morning radiance of a young child’s disposition, but later in\r\nthe day of earthly existence might be prolific of the storm and\r\nwhirlwind.\r\n\r\nThe discipline of the family, in those days, was of a far more rigid\r\nkind than now. The frown, the harsh rebuke, the frequent application\r\nof the rod, enjoined by Scriptural authority, were used, not merely in\r\nthe way of punishment for actual offences, but as a wholesome regimen\r\nfor the growth and promotion of all childish virtues. Hester Prynne,\r\nnevertheless, the lonely mother of this one child, ran little risk of\r\nerring on the side of undue severity. Mindful, however, of her own\r\nerrors and misfortunes, she early sought to impose a tender, but\r\nstrict control over the infant immortality that was committed to her\r\ncharge. But the task was beyond her skill. After testing both smiles\r\nand frowns, and proving that neither mode of treatment possessed any\r\ncalculable influence, Hester was ultimately compelled to stand aside,\r\nand permit the child to be swayed by her own impulses. Physical\r\ncompulsion or restraint was effectual, of course, while it lasted. As\r\nto any other kind of discipline, whether addressed to her mind or\r\nheart, little Pearl might or might not be within its reach, in\r\naccordance with the caprice that ruled the moment. Her mother, while\r\nPearl was yet an infant, grew acquainted with a certain peculiar look,\r\nthat warned her when it would be labor thrown away to insist,\r\npersuade, or plead. It was a look so intelligent, yet inexplicable,\r\nso perverse, sometimes so malicious, but generally accompanied by a\r\nwild flow of spirits, that Hester could not help questioning, at such\r\nmoments, whether Pearl were a human child. She seemed rather an airy\r\nsprite, which, after playing its fantastic sports for a little while\r\nupon the cottage floor, would flit away with a mocking smile. Whenever\r\nthat look appeared in her wild, bright, deeply black eyes, it invested\r\nher with a strange remoteness and intangibility; it was as if she were\r\nhovering in the air and might vanish, like a glimmering light, that\r\ncomes we know not whence, and goes we know not whither. Beholding it,\r\nHester was constrained to rush towards the child,—to pursue the\r\nlittle elf in the flight which she invariably began,—to snatch her to\r\nher bosom, with a close pressure and earnest kisses,—not so much from\r\noverflowing love, as to assure herself that Pearl was flesh and blood,\r\nand not utterly delusive. But Pearl’s laugh, when she was caught,\r\nthough full of merriment and music, made her mother more doubtful than\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nHeart-smitten at this bewildering and baffling spell, that so often\r\ncame between herself and her sole treasure, whom she had bought so\r\ndear, and who was all her world, Hester sometimes burst into\r\npassionate tears. Then, perhaps,—for there was no foreseeing how it\r\nmight affect her,—Pearl would frown, and clench her little fist, and\r\nharden her small features into a stern, unsympathizing look of\r\ndiscontent. Not seldom, she would laugh anew, and louder than before,\r\nlike a thing incapable and unintelligent of human sorrow. Or—but this\r\nmore rarely happened—she would be convulsed with a rage of grief, and\r\nsob out her love for her mother, in broken words, and seem intent on\r\nproving that she had a heart, by breaking it. Yet Hester was hardly\r\nsafe in confiding herself to that gusty tenderness; it passed, as\r\nsuddenly as it came. Brooding over all these matters, the mother felt\r\nlike one who has evoked a spirit, but, by some irregularity in the\r\nprocess of conjuration, has failed to win the master-word that should\r\ncontrol this new and incomprehensible intelligence. Her only real\r\ncomfort was when the child lay in the placidity of sleep. Then she was\r\nsure of her, and tasted hours of quiet, sad, delicious happiness;\r\nuntil—perhaps with that perverse expression glimmering from beneath\r\nher opening lids—little Pearl awoke!\r\n\r\nHow soon—with what strange rapidity, indeed!—did Pearl arrive at an\r\nage that was capable of social intercourse, beyond the mother’s\r\never-ready smile and nonsense-words! And then what a happiness would\r\nit have been, could Hester Prynne have heard her clear, bird-like\r\nvoice mingling with the uproar of other childish voices, and have\r\ndistinguished and unravelled her own darling’s tones, amid all the\r\nentangled outcry of a group of sportive children! But this could never\r\nbe. Pearl was a born outcast of the infantile world. An imp of evil,\r\nemblem and product of sin, she had no right among christened infants.\r\nNothing was more remarkable than the instinct, as it seemed, with\r\nwhich the child comprehended her loneliness; the destiny that had\r\ndrawn an inviolable circle round about her; the whole peculiarity, in\r\nshort, of her position in respect to other children. Never, since her\r\nrelease from prison, had Hester met the public gaze without her. In\r\nall her walks about the town, Pearl, too, was there; first as the babe\r\nin arms, and afterwards as the little girl, small companion of her\r\nmother, holding a forefinger with her whole grasp, and tripping along\r\nat the rate of three or four footsteps to one of Hester’s. She saw the\r\nchildren of the settlement, on the grassy margin of the street, or at\r\nthe domestic thresholds, disporting themselves in such grim fashion\r\nas the Puritanic nurture would permit; playing at going to church,\r\nperchance; or at scourging Quakers; or taking scalps in a sham-fight\r\nwith the Indians; or scaring one another with freaks of imitative\r\nwitchcraft. Pearl saw, and gazed intently, but never sought to make\r\nacquaintance. If spoken to, she would not speak again. If the children\r\ngathered about her, as they sometimes did, Pearl would grow positively\r\nterrible in her puny wrath, snatching up stones to fling at them, with\r\nshrill, incoherent exclamations, that made her mother tremble, because\r\nthey had so much the sound of a witch’s anathemas in some unknown\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\nThe truth was, that the little Puritans, being of the most intolerant\r\nbrood that ever lived, had got a vague idea of something outlandish,\r\nunearthly, or at variance with ordinary fashions, in the mother and\r\nchild; and therefore scorned them in their hearts, and not\r\nunfrequently reviled them with their tongues. Pearl felt the\r\nsentiment, and requited it with the bitterest hatred that can be\r\nsupposed to rankle in a childish bosom. These outbreaks of a fierce\r\ntemper had a kind of value, and even comfort, for her mother; because\r\nthere was at least an intelligible earnestness in the mood, instead of\r\nthe fitful caprice that so often thwarted her in the child’s\r\nmanifestations. It appalled her, nevertheless, to discern here, again,\r\na shadowy reflection of the evil that had existed in herself. All this\r\nenmity and passion had Pearl inherited, by inalienable right, out of\r\nHester’s heart. Mother and daughter stood together in the same circle\r\nof seclusion from human society; and in the nature of the child seemed\r\nto be perpetuated those unquiet elements that had distracted Hester\r\nPrynne before Pearl’s birth, but had since begun to be soothed away by\r\nthe softening influences of maternity.\r\n\r\nAt home, within and around her mother’s cottage, Pearl wanted not a\r\nwide and various circle of acquaintance. The spell of life went forth\r\nfrom her ever-creative spirit, and communicated itself to a thousand\r\nobjects, as a torch kindles a flame wherever it may be applied. The\r\nunlikeliest materials—a stick, a bunch of rags, a flower—were the\r\npuppets of Pearl’s witchcraft, and, without undergoing any outward\r\nchange, became spiritually adapted to whatever drama occupied the\r\nstage of her inner world. Her one baby-voice served a multitude of\r\nimaginary personages, old and young, to talk withal. The pine-trees,\r\naged, black and solemn, and flinging groans and other melancholy\r\nutterances on the breeze, needed little transformation to figure as\r\nPuritan elders; the ugliest weeds of the garden were their children,\r\nwhom Pearl smote down and uprooted, most unmercifully. It was\r\nwonderful, the vast variety of forms into which she threw her\r\nintellect, with no continuity, indeed, but darting up and dancing,\r\nalways in a state of preternatural activity,—soon sinking down, as if\r\nexhausted by so rapid and feverish a tide of life,—and succeeded by\r\nother shapes of a similar wild energy. It was like nothing so much as\r\nthe phantasmagoric play of the northern lights. In the mere exercise\r\nof the fancy, however, and the sportiveness of a growing mind, there\r\nmight be little more than was observable in other children of bright\r\nfaculties; except as Pearl, in the dearth of human playmates, was\r\nthrown more upon the visionary throng which she created. The\r\nsingularity lay in the hostile feelings with which the child regarded\r\nall these offspring of her own heart and mind. She never created a\r\nfriend, but seemed always to be sowing broadcast the dragon’s teeth,\r\nwhence sprung a harvest of armed enemies, against whom she rushed to\r\nbattle. It was inexpressibly sad—then what depth of sorrow to a\r\nmother, who felt in her own heart the cause!—to observe, in one so\r\nyoung, this constant recognition of an adverse world, and so fierce a\r\ntraining of the energies that were to make good her cause, in the\r\ncontest that must ensue.\r\n\r\nGazing at Pearl, Hester Prynne often dropped her work upon her knees,\r\nand cried out with an agony which she would fain have hidden, but\r\nwhich made utterance for itself, betwixt speech and a groan,—“O\r\nFather in Heaven,—if Thou art still my Father,—what is this being\r\nwhich I have brought into the world!” And Pearl, overhearing the\r\nejaculation, or aware, through some more subtile channel, of those\r\nthrobs of anguish, would turn her vivid and beautiful little face upon\r\nher mother, smile with sprite-like intelligence, and resume her play.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A touch of Pearl’s baby-hand]\r\n\r\nOne peculiarity of the child’s deportment remains yet to be told. The\r\nvery first thing which she had noticed in her life was—what?—not the\r\nmother’s smile, responding to it, as other babies do, by that faint,\r\nembryo smile of the little mouth, remembered so doubtfully afterwards,\r\nand with such fond discussion whether it were indeed a smile. By no\r\nmeans! But that first object of which Pearl seemed to become aware\r\nwas—shall we say it?—the scarlet letter on Hester’s bosom! One day,\r\nas her mother stooped over the cradle, the infant’s eyes had been\r\ncaught by the glimmering of the gold embroidery about the letter; and,\r\nputting up her little hand, she grasped at it, smiling, not\r\ndoubtfully, but with a decided gleam, that gave her face the look of a\r\nmuch older child. Then, gasping for breath, did Hester Prynne clutch\r\nthe fatal token, instinctively endeavoring to tear it away; so\r\ninfinite was the torture inflicted by the intelligent touch of Pearl’s\r\nbaby-hand. Again, as if her mother’s agonized gesture were meant only\r\nto make sport for her, did little Pearl look into her eyes, and\r\nsmile! From that epoch, except when the child was asleep, Hester had\r\nnever felt a moment’s safety; not a moment’s calm enjoyment of her.\r\nWeeks, it is true, would sometimes elapse, during which Pearl’s gaze\r\nmight never once be fixed upon the scarlet letter; but then, again, it\r\nwould come at unawares, like the stroke of sudden death, and always\r\nwith that peculiar smile, and odd expression of the eyes.\r\n\r\nOnce, this freakish, elvish cast came into the child’s eyes, while\r\nHester was looking at her own image in them, as mothers are fond of\r\ndoing; and, suddenly,—for women in solitude, and with troubled\r\nhearts, are pestered with unaccountable delusions,—she fancied that\r\nshe beheld, not her own miniature portrait, but another face, in the\r\nsmall black mirror of Pearl’s eye. It was a face, fiend-like, full of\r\nsmiling malice, yet bearing the semblance of features that she had\r\nknown full well, though seldom with a smile, and never with malice in\r\nthem. It was as if an evil spirit possessed the child, and had just\r\nthen peeped forth in mockery. Many a time afterwards had Hester been\r\ntortured, though less vividly, by the same illusion.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of a certain summer’s day, after Pearl grew big\r\nenough to run about, she amused herself with gathering handfuls of\r\nwild-flowers, and flinging them, one by one, at her mother’s bosom;\r\ndancing up and down, like a little elf, whenever she hit the scarlet\r\nletter. Hester’s first motion had been to cover her bosom with her\r\nclasped hands. But, whether from pride or resignation, or a feeling\r\nthat her penance might best be wrought out by this unutterable pain,\r\nshe resisted the impulse, and sat erect, pale as death, looking sadly\r\ninto little Pearl’s wild eyes. Still came the battery of flowers,\r\nalmost invariably hitting the mark, and covering the mother’s breast\r\nwith hurts for which she could find no balm in this world, nor knew\r\nhow to seek it in another. At last, her shot being all expended, the\r\nchild stood still and gazed at Hester, with that little, laughing\r\nimage of a fiend peeping out—or, whether it peeped or no, her mother\r\nso imagined it—from the unsearchable abyss of her black eyes.\r\n\r\n“Child, what art thou?” cried the mother.\r\n\r\n“O, I am your little Pearl!” answered the child.\r\n\r\nBut, while she said it, Pearl laughed, and began to dance up and down,\r\nwith the humorsome gesticulation of a little imp, whose next freak\r\nmight be to fly up the chimney.\r\n\r\n“Art thou my child, in very truth?” asked Hester.\r\n\r\nNor did she put the question altogether idly, but, for the moment,\r\nwith a portion of genuine earnestness; for, such was Pearl’s wonderful\r\nintelligence, that her mother half doubted whether she were not\r\nacquainted with the secret spell of her existence, and might not now\r\nreveal herself.\r\n\r\n“Yes; I am little Pearl!” repeated the child, continuing her antics.\r\n\r\n“Thou art not my child! Thou art no Pearl of mine!” said the mother,\r\nhalf playfully; for it was often the case that a sportive impulse came\r\nover her, in the midst of her deepest suffering. “Tell me, then, what\r\nthou art, and who sent thee hither.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me, mother!” said the child, seriously, coming up to Hester, and\r\npressing herself close to her knees. “Do thou tell me!”\r\n\r\n“Thy Heavenly Father sent thee!” answered Hester Prynne.\r\n\r\nBut she said it with a hesitation that did not escape the acuteness of\r\nthe child. Whether moved only by her ordinary freakishness, or\r\nbecause an evil spirit prompted her, she put up her small forefinger,\r\nand touched the scarlet letter.\r\n\r\n“He did not send me!” cried she, positively. “I have no Heavenly\r\nFather!”\r\n\r\n“Hush, Pearl, hush! Thou must not talk so!” answered the mother,\r\nsuppressing a groan. “He sent us all into this world. He sent even me,\r\nthy mother. Then, much more, thee! Or, if not, thou strange and elfish\r\nchild, whence didst thou come?”\r\n\r\n“Tell me! Tell me!” repeated Pearl, no longer seriously, but laughing,\r\nand capering about the floor. “It is thou that must tell me!”\r\n\r\nBut Hester could not resolve the query, being herself in a dismal\r\nlabyrinth of doubt. She remembered—betwixt a smile and a shudder—the\r\ntalk of the neighboring towns-people; who, seeking vainly elsewhere\r\nfor the child’s paternity, and observing some of her odd attributes,\r\nhad given out that poor little Pearl was a demon offspring; such as,\r\never since old Catholic times, had occasionally been seen on earth,\r\nthrough the agency of their mother’s sin, and to promote some foul and\r\nwicked purpose. Luther, according to the scandal of his monkish\r\nenemies, was a brat of that hellish breed; nor was Pearl the only\r\nchild to whom this inauspicious origin was assigned, among the New\r\nEngland Puritans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\n [Illustration]"

      "content": "THE GOVERNOR’S HALL.\r\n\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHester Prynne went, one day, to the mansion of Governor Bellingham,\r\nwith a pair of gloves, which she had fringed and embroidered to his\r\norder, and which were to be worn on some great occasion of state; for,\r\nthough the chances of a popular election had caused this former ruler\r\nto descend a step or two from the highest rank, he still held an\r\nhonorable and influential place among the colonial magistracy.\r\n\r\nAnother and far more important reason than the delivery of a pair of\r\nembroidered gloves impelled Hester, at this time, to seek an interview\r\nwith a personage of so much power and activity in the affairs of the\r\nsettlement. It had reached her ears, that there was a design on the\r\npart of some of the leading inhabitants, cherishing the more rigid\r\norder of principles in religion and government, to deprive her of her\r\nchild. On the supposition that Pearl, as already hinted, was of demon\r\norigin, these good people not unreasonably argued that a Christian\r\ninterest in the mother’s soul required them to remove such a\r\nstumbling-block from her path. If the child, on the other hand, were\r\nreally capable of moral and religious growth, and possessed the\r\nelements of ultimate salvation, then, surely, it would enjoy all the\r\nfairer prospect of these advantages, by being transferred to wiser and\r\nbetter guardianship than Hester Prynne’s. Among those who promoted the\r\ndesign, Governor Bellingham was said to be one of the most busy. It\r\nmay appear singular, and indeed, not a little ludicrous, that an\r\naffair of this kind, which, in later days, would have been referred to\r\nno higher jurisdiction than that of the selectmen of the town, should\r\nthen have been a question publicly discussed, and on which statesmen\r\nof eminence took sides. At that epoch of pristine simplicity, however,\r\nmatters of even slighter public interest, and of far less intrinsic\r\nweight, than the welfare of Hester and her child, were strangely mixed\r\nup with the deliberations of legislators and acts of state. The period\r\nwas hardly, if at all, earlier than that of our story, when a dispute\r\nconcerning the right of property in a pig not only caused a fierce and\r\nbitter contest in the legislative body of the colony, but resulted in\r\nan important modification of the framework itself of the legislature.\r\n\r\nFull of concern, therefore,—but so conscious of her own right that it\r\nseemed scarcely an unequal match between the public, on the one side,\r\nand a lonely woman, backed by the sympathies of nature, on the\r\nother,—Hester Prynne set forth from her solitary cottage. Little\r\nPearl, of course, was her companion. She was now of an age to run\r\nlightly along by her mother’s side, and, constantly in motion, from\r\nmorn till sunset, could have accomplished a much longer journey than\r\nthat before her. Often, nevertheless, more from caprice than\r\nnecessity, she demanded to be taken up in arms; but was soon as\r\nimperious to be set down again, and frisked onward before Hester on\r\nthe grassy pathway, with many a harmless trip and tumble. We have\r\nspoken of Pearl’s rich and luxuriant beauty; a beauty that shone with\r\ndeep and vivid tints; a bright complexion, eyes possessing intensity\r\nboth of depth and glow, and hair already of a deep, glossy brown, and\r\nwhich, in after years, would be nearly akin to black. There was fire\r\nin her and throughout her; she seemed the unpremeditated offshoot of a\r\npassionate moment. Her mother, in contriving the child’s garb, had\r\nallowed the gorgeous tendencies of her imagination their full play;\r\narraying her in a crimson velvet tunic, of a peculiar cut, abundantly\r\nembroidered with fantasies and flourishes of gold-thread. So much\r\nstrength of coloring, which must have given a wan and pallid aspect to\r\ncheeks of a fainter bloom, was admirably adapted to Pearl’s beauty,\r\nand made her the very brightest little jet of flame that ever danced\r\nupon the earth.\r\n\r\nBut it was a remarkable attribute of this garb, and, indeed, of the\r\nchild’s whole appearance, that it irresistibly and inevitably reminded\r\nthe beholder of the token which Hester Prynne was doomed to wear upon\r\nher bosom. It was the scarlet letter in another form; the scarlet\r\nletter endowed with life! The mother herself—as if the red ignominy\r\nwere so deeply scorched into her brain that all her conceptions\r\nassumed its form—had carefully wrought out the similitude; lavishing\r\nmany hours of morbid ingenuity, to create an analogy between the\r\nobject of her affection and the emblem of her guilt and torture. But,\r\nin truth, Pearl was the one, as well as the other; and only in\r\nconsequence of that identity had Hester contrived so perfectly to\r\nrepresent the scarlet letter in her appearance.\r\n\r\nAs the two wayfarers came within the precincts of the town, the\r\nchildren of the Puritans looked up from their play,—or what passed\r\nfor play with those sombre little urchins,—and spake gravely one to\r\nanother:—\r\n\r\n“Behold, verily, there is the woman of the scarlet letter; and, of a\r\ntruth, moreover, there is the likeness of the scarlet letter running\r\nalong by her side! Come, therefore, and let us fling mud at them!”\r\n\r\nBut Pearl, who was a dauntless child, after frowning, stamping her\r\nfoot, and shaking her little hand with a variety of threatening\r\ngestures, suddenly made a rush at the knot of her enemies, and put\r\nthem all to flight. She resembled, in her fierce pursuit of them, an\r\ninfant pestilence,—the scarlet fever, or some such half-fledged angel\r\nof judgment,—whose mission was to punish the sins of the rising\r\ngeneration. She screamed and shouted, too, with a terrific volume of\r\nsound, which, doubtless, caused the hearts of the fugitives to quake\r\nwithin them. The victory accomplished, Pearl returned quietly to her\r\nmother, and looked up, smiling, into her face.\r\n\r\nWithout further adventure, they reached the dwelling of Governor\r\nBellingham. This was a large wooden house, built in a fashion of which\r\nthere are specimens still extant in the streets of our older towns;\r\nnow moss-grown, crumbling to decay, and melancholy at heart with the\r\nmany sorrowful or joyful occurrences, remembered or forgotten, that\r\nhave happened, and passed away, within their dusky chambers. Then,\r\nhowever, there was the freshness of the passing year on its exterior,\r\nand the cheerfulness, gleaming forth from the sunny windows, of a\r\nhuman habitation, into which death had never entered. It had, indeed,\r\na very cheery aspect; the walls being overspread with a kind of\r\nstucco, in which fragments of broken glass were plentifully\r\nintermixed; so that, when the sunshine fell aslant-wise over the front\r\nof the edifice, it glittered and sparkled as if diamonds had been\r\nflung against it by the double handful. The brilliancy might have\r\nbefitted Aladdin’s palace, rather than the mansion of a grave old\r\nPuritan ruler. It was further decorated with strange and seemingly\r\ncabalistic figures and diagrams, suitable to the quaint taste of the\r\nage, which had been drawn in the stucco when newly laid on, and had\r\nnow grown hard and durable, for the admiration of after times.\r\n\r\nPearl, looking at this bright wonder of a house, began to caper and\r\ndance, and imperatively required that the whole breadth of sunshine\r\nshould be stripped off its front, and given her to play with.\r\n\r\n“No, my little Pearl!” said her mother. “Thou must gather thine own\r\nsunshine. I have none to give thee!”\r\n\r\nThey approached the door; which was of an arched form, and flanked on\r\neach side by a narrow tower or projection of the edifice, in both of\r\nwhich were lattice-windows, with wooden shutters to close over them at\r\nneed. Lifting the iron hammer that hung at the portal, Hester Prynne\r\ngave a summons, which was answered by one of the Governor’s\r\nbond-servants; a free-born Englishman, but now a seven years’ slave.\r\nDuring that term he was to be the property of his master, and as much\r\na commodity of bargain and sale as an ox, or a joint-stool. The serf\r\nwore the blue coat, which was the customary garb of serving-men of\r\nthat period, and long before, in the old hereditary halls of England.\r\n\r\n“Is the worshipful Governor Bellingham within?” inquired Hester.\r\n\r\n“Yea, forsooth,” replied the bond-servant, staring with wide-open eyes\r\nat the scarlet letter, which, being a new-comer in the country, he had\r\nnever before seen. “Yea, his honorable worship is within. But he hath\r\na godly minister or two with him, and likewise a leech. Ye may not see\r\nhis worship now.”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, I will enter,” answered Hester Prynne, and the\r\nbond-servant, perhaps judging from the decision of her air, and the\r\nglittering symbol in her bosom, that she was a great lady in the land,\r\noffered no opposition.\r\n\r\nSo the mother and little Pearl were admitted into the hall of\r\nentrance. With many variations, suggested by the nature of his\r\nbuilding-materials, diversity of climate, and a different mode of\r\nsocial life, Governor Bellingham had planned his new habitation after\r\nthe residences of gentlemen of fair estate in his native land. Here,\r\nthen, was a wide and reasonably lofty hall, extending through the\r\nwhole depth of the house, and forming a medium of general\r\ncommunication, more or less directly, with all the other apartments.\r\nAt one extremity, this spacious room was lighted by the windows of the\r\ntwo towers, which formed a small recess on either side of the portal.\r\nAt the other end, though partly muffled by a curtain, it was more\r\npowerfully illuminated by one of those embowed hall-windows which we\r\nread of in old books, and which was provided with a deep and cushioned\r\nseat. Here, on the cushion, lay a folio tome, probably of the\r\nChronicles of England, or other such substantial literature; even as,\r\nin our own days, we scatter gilded volumes on the centre-table, to be\r\nturned over by the casual guest. The furniture of the hall consisted\r\nof some ponderous chairs, the backs of which were elaborately carved\r\nwith wreaths of oaken flowers; and likewise a table in the same taste;\r\nthe whole being of the Elizabethan age, or perhaps earlier, and\r\nheirlooms, transferred hither from the Governor’s paternal home. On\r\nthe table—in token that the sentiment of old English hospitality had\r\nnot been left behind—stood a large pewter tankard, at the bottom of\r\nwhich, had Hester or Pearl peeped into it, they might have seen the\r\nfrothy remnant of a recent draught of ale.\r\n\r\nOn the wall hung a row of portraits, representing the forefathers of\r\nthe Bellingham lineage, some with armor on their breasts, and others\r\nwith stately ruffs and robes of peace. All were characterized by the\r\nsternness and severity which old portraits so invariably put on; as if\r\nthey were the ghosts, rather than the pictures, of departed worthies,\r\nand were gazing with harsh and intolerant criticism at the pursuits\r\nand enjoyments of living men.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Governor’s Breastplate]\r\n\r\nAt about the centre of the oaken panels, that lined the hall, was\r\nsuspended a suit of mail, not, like the pictures, an ancestral relic,\r\nbut of the most modern date; for it had been manufactured by a skilful\r\narmorer in London, the same year in which Governor Bellingham came\r\nover to New England. There was a steel head-piece, a cuirass, a\r\ngorget, and greaves, with a pair of gauntlets and a sword hanging\r\nbeneath; all, and especially the helmet and breastplate, so highly\r\nburnished as to glow with white radiance, and scatter an illumination\r\neverywhere about upon the floor. This bright panoply was not meant for\r\nmere idle show, but had been worn by the Governor on many a solemn\r\nmuster and training field, and had glittered, moreover, at the head of\r\na regiment in the Pequod war. For, though bred a lawyer, and\r\naccustomed to speak of Bacon, Coke, Noye, and Finch as his\r\nprofessional associates, the exigencies of this new country had\r\ntransformed Governor Bellingham into a soldier, as well as a statesman\r\nand ruler.\r\n\r\nLittle Pearl—who was as greatly pleased with the gleaming armor as\r\nshe had been with the glittering frontispiece of the house—spent some\r\ntime looking into the polished mirror of the breastplate.\r\n\r\n“Mother,” cried she, “I see you here. Look! Look!”\r\n\r\nHester looked, by way of humoring the child; and she saw that, owing\r\nto the peculiar effect of this convex mirror, the scarlet letter was\r\nrepresented in exaggerated and gigantic proportions, so as to be\r\ngreatly the most prominent feature of her appearance. In truth, she\r\nseemed absolutely hidden behind it. Pearl pointed upward, also, at a\r\nsimilar picture in the head-piece; smiling at her mother, with the\r\nelfish intelligence that was so familiar an expression on her small\r\nphysiognomy. That look of naughty merriment was likewise reflected in\r\nthe mirror, with so much breadth and intensity of effect, that it made\r\nHester Prynne feel as if it could not be the image of her own child,\r\nbut of an imp who was seeking to mould itself into Pearl’s shape.\r\n\r\n“Come along, Pearl,” said she, drawing her away. “Come and look into\r\nthis fair garden. It may be we shall see flowers there; more beautiful\r\nones than we find in the woods.”\r\n\r\nPearl, accordingly, ran to the bow-window, at the farther end of the\r\nhall, and looked along the vista of a garden-walk, carpeted with\r\nclosely shaven grass, and bordered with some rude and immature attempt\r\nat shrubbery. But the proprietor appeared already to have\r\nrelinquished, as hopeless, the effort to perpetuate on this side of\r\nthe Atlantic, in a hard soil and amid the close struggle for\r\nsubsistence, the native English taste for ornamental gardening.\r\nCabbages grew in plain sight; and a pumpkin-vine, rooted at some\r\ndistance, had run across the intervening space, and deposited one of\r\nits gigantic products directly beneath the hall-window; as if to warn\r\nthe Governor that this great lump of vegetable gold was as rich an\r\nornament as New England earth would offer him. There were a few\r\nrose-bushes, however, and a number of apple-trees, probably the\r\ndescendants of those planted by the Reverend Mr. Blackstone, the first\r\nsettler of the peninsula; that half-mythological personage, who rides\r\nthrough our early annals, seated on the back of a bull.\r\n\r\nPearl, seeing the rose-bushes, began to cry for a red rose, and would\r\nnot be pacified.\r\n\r\n“Hush, child, hush!” said her mother, earnestly. “Do not cry, dear\r\nlittle Pearl! I hear voices in the garden. The Governor is coming, and\r\ngentlemen along with him!”\r\n\r\nIn fact, adown the vista of the garden avenue a number of persons were\r\nseen approaching towards the house. Pearl, in utter scorn of her\r\nmother’s attempt to quiet her, gave an eldritch scream, and then\r\nbecame silent; not from any notion of obedience, but because the quick\r\nand mobile curiosity of her disposition was excited by the appearance\r\nof these new personages.\r\n\n [Illustration]"

      "content": "THE ELF-CHILD AND THE MINISTER.\r\n\nGovernor Bellingham, in a loose gown and easy cap,—such as elderly\r\ngentlemen loved to endue themselves with, in their domestic\r\nprivacy,—walked foremost, and appeared to be showing off his estate,\r\nand expatiating on his projected improvements. The wide circumference\r\nof an elaborate ruff, beneath his gray beard, in the antiquated\r\nfashion of King James’s reign, caused his head to look not a little\r\nlike that of John the Baptist in a charger. The impression made by his\r\naspect, so rigid and severe, and frost-bitten with more than autumnal\r\nage, was hardly in keeping with the appliances of worldly enjoyment\r\nwherewith he had evidently done his utmost to surround himself. But it\r\nis an error to suppose that our grave forefathers—though accustomed\r\nto speak and think of human existence as a state merely of trial and\r\nwarfare, and though unfeignedly prepared to sacrifice goods and life\r\nat the behest of duty—made it a matter of conscience to reject such\r\nmeans of comfort, or even luxury, as lay fairly within their grasp.\r\nThis creed was never taught, for instance, by the venerable pastor,\r\nJohn Wilson, whose beard, white as a snow-drift, was seen over\r\nGovernor Bellingham’s shoulder; while its wearer suggested that pears\r\nand peaches might yet be naturalized in the New England climate, and\r\nthat purple grapes might possibly be compelled to nourish, against the\r\nsunny garden-wall. The old clergyman, nurtured at the rich bosom of\r\nthe English Church, had a long-established and legitimate taste for\r\nall good and comfortable things; and however stern he might show\r\nhimself in the pulpit, or in his public reproof of such transgressions\r\nas that of Hester Prynne, still the genial benevolence of his private\r\nlife had won him warmer affection than was accorded to any of his\r\nprofessional contemporaries.\r\n\r\nBehind the Governor and Mr. Wilson came two other guests: one the\r\nReverend Arthur Dimmesdale, whom the reader may remember as having\r\ntaken a brief and reluctant part in the scene of Hester Prynne’s\r\ndisgrace; and, in close companionship with him, old Roger\r\nChillingworth, a person of great skill in physic, who, for two or\r\nthree years past, had been settled in the town. It was understood that\r\nthis learned man was the physician as well as friend of the young\r\nminister, whose health had severely suffered, of late, by his too\r\nunreserved self-sacrifice to the labors and duties of the pastoral\r\nrelation.\r\n\r\nThe Governor, in advance of his visitors, ascended one or two steps,\r\nand, throwing open the leaves of the great hall-window, found himself\r\nclose to little Pearl. The shadow of the curtain fell on Hester\r\nPrynne, and partially concealed her.\r\n\r\n“What have we here?” said Governor Bellingham, looking with surprise\r\nat the scarlet little figure before him. “I profess, I have never seen\r\nthe like, since my days of vanity, in old King James’s time, when I\r\nwas wont to esteem it a high favor to be admitted to a court mask!\r\nThere used to be a swarm of these small apparitions, in holiday time;\r\nand we called them children of the Lord of Misrule. But how gat such a\r\nguest into my hall?”\r\n\r\n“Ay, indeed!” cried good old Mr. Wilson. “What little bird of scarlet\r\nplumage may this be? Methinks I have seen just such figures, when the\r\nsun has been shining through a richly painted window, and tracing out\r\nthe golden and crimson images across the floor. But that was in the\r\nold land. Prithee, young one, who art thou, and what has ailed thy\r\nmother to bedizen thee in this strange fashion? Art thou a Christian\r\nchild,—ha? Dost know thy catechism? Or art thou one of those naughty\r\nelfs or fairies, whom we thought to have left behind us, with other\r\nrelics of Papistry, in merry old England?”\r\n\r\n“I am mother’s child,” answered the scarlet vision, “and my name is\r\nPearl!”\r\n\r\n“Pearl?—Ruby, rather!—or Coral!—or Red Rose, at the very least,\r\njudging from thy hue!” responded the old minister, putting forth his\r\nhand in a vain attempt to pat little Pearl on the cheek. “But where is\r\nthis mother of thine? Ah! I see,” he added; and, turning to Governor\r\nBellingham, whispered, “This is the selfsame child of whom we have\r\nheld speech together; and behold here the unhappy woman, Hester\r\nPrynne, her mother!”\r\n\r\n“Sayest thou so?” cried the Governor. “Nay, we might have judged that\r\nsuch a child’s mother must needs be a scarlet woman, and a worthy type\r\nof her of Babylon! But she comes at a good time; and we will look into\r\nthis matter forthwith.”\r\n\r\nGovernor Bellingham stepped through the window into the hall, followed\r\nby his three guests.\r\n\r\n“Hester Prynne,” said he, fixing his naturally stern regard on the\r\nwearer of the scarlet letter, “there hath been much question\r\nconcerning thee, of late. The point hath been weightily discussed,\r\nwhether we, that are of authority and influence, do well discharge our\r\nconsciences by trusting an immortal soul, such as there is in yonder\r\nchild, to the guidance of one who hath stumbled and fallen, amid the\r\npitfalls of this world. Speak thou, the child’s own mother! Were it\r\nnot, thinkest thou, for thy little one’s temporal and eternal welfare\r\nthat she be taken out of thy charge, and clad soberly, and disciplined\r\nstrictly, and instructed in the truths of heaven and earth? What canst\r\nthou do for the child, in this kind?”\r\n\r\n“I can teach my little Pearl what I have learned from this!” answered\r\nHester Prynne, laying her finger on the red token.\r\n\r\n“Woman, it is thy badge of shame!” replied the stern magistrate. “It\r\nis because of the stain which that letter indicates, that we would\r\ntransfer thy child to other hands.”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless,” said the mother, calmly, though growing more pale,\r\n“this badge hath taught me—it daily teaches me—it is teaching me at\r\nthis moment—lessons whereof my child may be the wiser and better,\r\nalbeit they can profit nothing to myself.”\r\n\r\n“We will judge warily,” said Bellingham, “and look well what we are\r\nabout to do. Good Master Wilson, I pray you, examine this\r\nPearl,—since that is her name,—and see whether she hath had such\r\nChristian nurture as befits a child of her age.”\r\n\r\nThe old minister seated himself in an arm-chair, and made an effort to\r\ndraw Pearl betwixt his knees. But the child, unaccustomed to the touch\r\nor familiarity of any but her mother, escaped through the open window,\r\nand stood on the upper step, looking like a wild tropical bird, of\r\nrich plumage, ready to take flight into the upper air. Mr. Wilson, not\r\na little astonished at this outbreak,—for he was a grandfatherly sort\r\nof personage, and usually a vast favorite with children,—essayed,\r\nhowever, to proceed with the examination.\r\n\r\n“Pearl,” said he, with great solemnity, “thou must take heed to\r\ninstruction, that so, in due season, thou mayest wear in thy bosom the\r\npearl of great price. Canst thou tell me, my child, who made thee?”\r\n\r\nNow Pearl knew well enough who made her; for Hester Prynne, the\r\ndaughter of a pious home, very soon after her talk with the child\r\nabout her Heavenly Father, had begun to inform her of those truths\r\nwhich the human spirit, at whatever stage of immaturity, imbibes with\r\nsuch eager interest. Pearl, therefore, so large were the attainments\r\nof her three years’ lifetime, could have borne a fair examination in\r\nthe New England Primer, or the first column of the Westminster\r\nCatechisms, although unacquainted with the outward form of either of\r\nthose celebrated works. But that perversity which all children have\r\nmore or less of, and of which little Pearl had a tenfold portion, now,\r\nat the most inopportune moment, took thorough possession of her, and\r\nclosed her lips, or impelled her to speak words amiss. After putting\r\nher finger in her mouth, with many ungracious refusals to answer good\r\nMr. Wilson’s question, the child finally announced that she had not\r\nbeen made at all, but had been plucked by her mother off the bush of\r\nwild roses that grew by the prison-door.\r\n\r\nThis fantasy was probably suggested by the near proximity of the\r\nGovernor’s red roses, as Pearl stood outside of the window; together\r\nwith her recollection of the prison rose-bush, which she had passed in\r\ncoming hither.\r\n\r\nOld Roger Chillingworth, with a smile on his face, whispered something\r\nin the young clergyman’s ear. Hester Prynne looked at the man of\r\nskill, and even then, with her fate hanging in the balance, was\r\nstartled to perceive what a change had come over his features,—how\r\nmuch uglier they were,—how his dark complexion seemed to have grown\r\nduskier, and his figure more misshapen,—since the days when she had\r\nfamiliarly known him. She met his eyes for an instant, but was\r\nimmediately constrained to give all her attention to the scene now\r\ngoing forward.\r\n\r\n“This is awful!” cried the Governor, slowly recovering from the\r\nastonishment into which Pearl’s response had thrown him. “Here is a\r\nchild of three years old, and she cannot tell who made her! Without\r\nquestion, she is equally in the dark as to her soul, its present\r\ndepravity, and future destiny! Methinks, gentlemen, we need inquire no\r\nfurther.”\r\n\r\nHester caught hold of Pearl, and drew her forcibly into her arms,\r\nconfronting the old Puritan magistrate with almost a fierce\r\nexpression. Alone in the world, cast off by it, and with this sole\r\ntreasure to keep her heart alive, she felt that she possessed\r\nindefeasible rights against the world, and was ready to defend them to\r\nthe death.\r\n\r\n“God gave me the child!” cried she. “He gave her in requital of all\r\nthings else, which ye had taken from me. She is my happiness!—she is\r\nmy torture, none the less! Pearl keeps me here in life! Pearl punishes\r\nme too! See ye not, she is the scarlet letter, only capable of being\r\nloved, and so endowed with a million-fold the power of retribution for\r\nmy sin? Ye shall not take her! I will die first!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Look thou to it! I will not lose the child!”]\r\n\r\n“My poor woman,” said the not unkind old minister, “the child shall be\r\nwell cared for!—far better than thou canst do it!”\r\n\r\n“God gave her into my keeping,” repeated Hester Prynne, raising her\r\nvoice almost to a shriek. “I will not give her up!”—And here, by a\r\nsudden impulse, she turned to the young clergyman, Mr. Dimmesdale, at\r\nwhom, up to this moment, she had seemed hardly so much as once to\r\ndirect her eyes.—“Speak thou for me!” cried she. “Thou wast my\r\npastor, and hadst charge of my soul, and knowest me better than these\r\nmen can. I will not lose the child! Speak for me! Thou knowest,—for\r\nthou hast sympathies which these men lack!—thou knowest what is in my\r\nheart, and what are a mother’s rights, and how much the stronger they\r\nare, when that mother has but her child and the scarlet letter! Look\r\nthou to it! I will not lose the child! Look to it!”\r\n\r\nAt this wild and singular appeal, which indicated that Hester Prynne’s\r\nsituation had provoked her to little less than madness, the young\r\nminister at once came forward, pale, and holding his hand over his\r\nheart, as was his custom whenever his peculiarly nervous temperament\r\nwas thrown into agitation. He looked now more care-worn and emaciated\r\nthan as we described him at the scene of Hester’s public ignominy; and\r\nwhether it were his failing health, or whatever the cause might be,\r\nhis large dark eyes had a world of pain in their troubled and\r\nmelancholy depth.\r\n\r\n“There is truth in what she says,” began the minister, with a voice\r\nsweet, tremulous, but powerful, insomuch that the hall re-echoed, and\r\nthe hollow armor rang with it,—“truth in what Hester says, and in the\r\nfeeling which inspires her! God gave her the child, and gave her, too,\r\nan instinctive knowledge of its nature and requirements,—both\r\nseemingly so peculiar,—which no other mortal being can possess. And,\r\nmoreover, is there not a quality of awful sacredness in the relation\r\nbetween this mother and this child?”\r\n\r\n“Ay!—how is that, good Master Dimmesdale?” interrupted the Governor.\r\n“Make that plain, I pray you!”\r\n\r\n“It must be even so,” resumed the minister. “For, if we deem it\r\notherwise, do we not thereby say that the Heavenly Father, the Creator\r\nof all flesh, hath lightly recognized a deed of sin, and made of no\r\naccount the distinction between unhallowed lust and holy love? This\r\nchild of its father’s guilt and its mother’s shame hath come from the\r\nhand of God, to work in many ways upon her heart, who pleads so\r\nearnestly, and with such bitterness of spirit, the right to keep her.\r\nIt was meant for a blessing; for the one blessing of her life! It was\r\nmeant, doubtless, as the mother herself hath told us, for a\r\nretribution too; a torture to be felt at many an unthought-of moment;\r\na pang, a sting, an ever-recurring agony, in the midst of a troubled\r\njoy! Hath she not expressed this thought in the garb of the poor\r\nchild, so forcibly reminding us of that red symbol which sears her\r\nbosom?”\r\n\r\n“Well said, again!” cried good Mr. Wilson. “I feared the woman had no\r\nbetter thought than to make a mountebank of her child!”\r\n\r\n“O, not so!—not so!” continued Mr. Dimmesdale. “She recognizes,\r\nbelieve me, the solemn miracle which God hath wrought, in the\r\nexistence of that child. And may she feel, too,—what, methinks, is\r\nthe very truth,—that this boon was meant, above all things else, to\r\nkeep the mother’s soul alive, and to preserve her from blacker depths\r\nof sin into which Satan might else have sought to plunge her!\r\nTherefore it is good for this poor, sinful woman that she hath an\r\ninfant immortality, a being capable of eternal joy or sorrow,\r\nconfided to her care,—to be trained up by her to righteousness,—to\r\nremind her, at every moment, of her fall,—but yet to teach her, as it\r\nwere by the Creator’s sacred pledge, that, if she bring the child to\r\nheaven, the child also will bring its parent thither! Herein is the\r\nsinful mother happier than the sinful father. For Hester Prynne’s\r\nsake, then, and no less for the poor child’s sake, let us leave them\r\nas Providence hath seen fit to place them!”\r\n\r\n“You speak, my friend, with a strange earnestness,” said old Roger\r\nChillingworth, smiling at him.\r\n\r\n“And there is a weighty import in what my young brother hath spoken,”\r\nadded the Reverend Mr. Wilson. “What say you, worshipful Master\r\nBellingham? Hath he not pleaded well for the poor woman?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed hath he,” answered the magistrate, “and hath adduced such\r\narguments, that we will even leave the matter as it now stands; so\r\nlong, at least, as there shall be no further scandal in the woman.\r\nCare must be had, nevertheless, to put the child to due and stated\r\nexamination in the catechism, at thy hands or Master Dimmesdale’s.\r\nMoreover, at a proper season, the tithing-men must take heed that she\r\ngo both to school and to meeting.”\r\n\r\nThe young minister, on ceasing to speak, had withdrawn a few steps\r\nfrom the group, and stood with his face partially concealed in the\r\nheavy folds of the window-curtain; while the shadow of his figure,\r\nwhich the sunlight cast upon the floor, was tremulous with the\r\nvehemence of his appeal. Pearl, that wild and flighty little elf,\r\nstole softly towards him, and taking his hand in the grasp of both her\r\nown, laid her cheek against it; a caress so tender, and withal so\r\nunobtrusive, that her mother, who was looking on, asked herself,—“Is\r\nthat my Pearl?” Yet she knew that there was love in the child’s heart,\r\nalthough it mostly revealed itself in passion, and hardly twice in her\r\nlifetime had been softened by such gentleness as now. The\r\nminister,—for, save the long-sought regards of woman, nothing is\r\nsweeter than these marks of childish preference, accorded\r\nspontaneously by a spiritual instinct, and therefore seeming to imply\r\nin us something truly worthy to be loved,—the minister looked round,\r\nlaid his hand on the child’s head, hesitated an instant, and then\r\nkissed her brow. Little Pearl’s unwonted mood of sentiment lasted no\r\nlonger; she laughed, and went capering down the hall, so airily, that\r\nold Mr. Wilson raised a question whether even her tiptoes touched the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n“The little baggage hath witchcraft in her, I profess,” said he to Mr.\r\nDimmesdale. “She needs no old woman’s broomstick to fly withal!”\r\n\r\n“A strange child!” remarked old Roger Chillingworth. “It is easy to\r\nsee the mother’s part in her. Would it be beyond a philosopher’s\r\nresearch, think ye, gentlemen, to analyze that child’s nature, and,\r\nfrom its make and mould, to give a shrewd guess at the father?”\r\n\r\n“Nay; it would be sinful, in such a question, to follow the clew of\r\nprofane philosophy,” said Mr. Wilson. “Better to fast and pray upon\r\nit; and still better, it may be, to leave the mystery as we find it,\r\nunless Providence reveal it of its own accord. Thereby, every good\r\nChristian man hath a title to show a father’s kindness towards the\r\npoor, deserted babe.”\r\n\r\nThe affair being so satisfactorily concluded, Hester Prynne, with\r\nPearl, departed from the house. As they descended the steps, it is\r\naverred that the lattice of a chamber-window was thrown open, and\r\nforth into the sunny day was thrust the face of Mistress Hibbins,\r\nGovernor Bellingham’s bitter-tempered sister, and the same who, a few\r\nyears later, was executed as a witch.\r\n\r\n“Hist, hist!” said she, while her ill-omened physiognomy seemed to\r\ncast a shadow over the cheerful newness of the house. “Wilt thou go\r\nwith us to-night? There will be a merry company in the forest; and I\r\nwellnigh promised the Black Man that comely Hester Prynne should make\r\none.”\r\n\r\n“Make my excuse to him, so please you!” answered Hester, with a\r\ntriumphant smile. “I must tarry at home, and keep watch over my little\r\nPearl. Had they taken her from me, I would willingly have gone with\r\nthee into the forest, and signed my name in the Black Man’s book too,\r\nand that with mine own blood!”\r\n\r\n“We shall have thee there anon!” said the witch-lady, frowning, as she\r\ndrew back her head.\r\n\r\nBut here—if we suppose this interview betwixt Mistress Hibbins and\r\nHester Prynne to be authentic, and not a parable—was already an\r\nillustration of the young minister’s argument against sundering the\r\nrelation of a fallen mother to the offspring of her frailty. Even thus\r\nearly had the child saved her from Satan’s snare.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\n [Illustration]"

      "content": "THE LEECH.\r\n\nUnder the appellation of Roger Chillingworth, the reader will\r\nremember, was hidden another name, which its former wearer had\r\nresolved should never more be spoken. It has been related, how, in the\r\ncrowd that witnessed Hester Prynne’s ignominious exposure, stood a\r\nman, elderly, travel-worn, who, just emerging from the perilous\r\nwilderness, beheld the woman, in whom he hoped to find embodied the\r\nwarmth and cheerfulness of home, set up as a type of sin before the\r\npeople. Her matronly fame was trodden under all men’s feet. Infamy was\r\nbabbling around her in the public market-place. For her kindred,\r\nshould the tidings ever reach them, and for the companions of her\r\nunspotted life, there remained nothing but the contagion of her\r\ndishonor; which would not fail to be distributed in strict accordance\r\nand proportion with the intimacy and sacredness of their previous\r\nrelationship. Then why—since the choice was with himself—should the\r\nindividual, whose connection with the fallen woman had been the most\r\nintimate and sacred of them all, come forward to vindicate his claim\r\nto an inheritance so little desirable? He resolved not to be pilloried\r\nbeside her on her pedestal of shame. Unknown to all but Hester Prynne,\r\nand possessing the lock and key of her silence, he chose to withdraw\r\nhis name from the roll of mankind, and, as regarded his former ties\r\nand interests, to vanish out of life as completely as if he indeed lay\r\nat the bottom of the ocean, whither rumor had long ago consigned him.\r\nThis purpose once effected, new interests would immediately spring up,\r\nand likewise a new purpose; dark, it is true, if not guilty, but of\r\nforce enough to engage the full strength of his faculties.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this resolve, he took up his residence in the Puritan\r\ntown, as Roger Chillingworth, without other introduction than the\r\nlearning and intelligence of which he possessed more than a common\r\nmeasure. As his studies, at a previous period of his life, had made\r\nhim extensively acquainted with the medical science of the day, it was\r\nas a physician that he presented himself, and as such was cordially\r\nreceived. Skilful men, of the medical and chirurgical profession, were\r\nof rare occurrence in the colony. They seldom, it would appear,\r\npartook of the religious zeal that brought other emigrants across the\r\nAtlantic. In their researches into the human frame, it may be that the\r\nhigher and more subtile faculties of such men were materialized, and\r\nthat they lost the spiritual view of existence amid the intricacies of\r\nthat wondrous mechanism, which seemed to involve art enough to\r\ncomprise all of life within itself. At all events, the health of the\r\ngood town of Boston, so far as medicine had aught to do with it, had\r\nhitherto lain in the guardianship of an aged deacon and apothecary,\r\nwhose piety and godly deportment were stronger testimonials in his\r\nfavor than any that he could have produced in the shape of a diploma.\r\nThe only surgeon was one who combined the occasional exercise of that\r\nnoble art with the daily and habitual flourish of a razor. To such a\r\nprofessional body Roger Chillingworth was a brilliant acquisition. He\r\nsoon manifested his familiarity with the ponderous and imposing\r\nmachinery of antique physic; in which every remedy contained a\r\nmultitude of far-fetched and heterogeneous ingredients, as elaborately\r\ncompounded as if the proposed result had been the Elixir of Life. In\r\nhis Indian captivity, moreover, he had gained much knowledge of the\r\nproperties of native herbs and roots; nor did he conceal from his\r\npatients, that these simple medicines, Nature’s boon to the untutored\r\nsavage, had quite as large a share of his own confidence as the\r\nEuropean pharmacopœia, which so many learned doctors had spent\r\ncenturies in elaborating.\r\n\r\nThis learned stranger was exemplary, as regarded, at least, the\r\noutward forms of a religious life, and, early after his arrival, had\r\nchosen for his spiritual guide the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale. The young\r\ndivine, whose scholar-like renown still lived in Oxford, was\r\nconsidered by his more fervent admirers as little less than a\r\nheaven-ordained apostle, destined, should he live and labor for the\r\nordinary term of life, to do as great deeds for the now feeble New\r\nEngland Church, as the early Fathers had achieved for the infancy of\r\nthe Christian faith. About this period, however, the health of Mr.\r\nDimmesdale had evidently begun to fail. By those best acquainted with\r\nhis habits, the paleness of the young minister’s cheek was accounted\r\nfor by his too earnest devotion to study, his scrupulous fulfilment of\r\nparochial duty, and, more than all, by the fasts and vigils of which\r\nhe made a frequent practice, in order to keep the grossness of this\r\nearthly state from clogging and obscuring his spiritual lamp. Some\r\ndeclared, that, if Mr. Dimmesdale were really going to die, it was\r\ncause enough, that the world was not worthy to be any longer trodden\r\nby his feet. He himself, on the other hand, with characteristic\r\nhumility, avowed his belief, that, if Providence should see fit to\r\nremove him, it would be because of his own unworthiness to perform its\r\nhumblest mission here on earth. With all this difference of opinion as\r\nto the cause of his decline, there could be no question of the fact.\r\nHis form grew emaciated; his voice, though still rich and sweet, had a\r\ncertain melancholy prophecy of decay in it; he was often observed, on\r\nany slight alarm or other sudden accident, to put his hand over his\r\nheart, with first a flush and then a paleness, indicative of pain.\r\n\r\nSuch was the young clergyman’s condition, and so imminent the prospect\r\nthat his dawning light would be extinguished, all untimely, when Roger\r\nChillingworth made his advent to the town. His first entry on the\r\nscene, few people could tell whence, dropping down, as it were, out of\r\nthe sky, or starting from the nether earth, had an aspect of mystery,\r\nwhich was easily heightened to the miraculous. He was now known to be\r\na man of skill; it was observed that he gathered herbs, and the\r\nblossoms of wild-flowers, and dug up roots, and plucked off twigs from\r\nthe forest-trees, like one acquainted with hidden virtues in what was\r\nvalueless to common eyes. He was heard to speak of Sir Kenelm Digby,\r\nand other famous men,—whose scientific attainments were esteemed\r\nhardly less than supernatural,—as having been his correspondents or\r\nassociates. Why, with such rank in the learned world, had he come\r\nhither? What could he, whose sphere was in great cities, be seeking in\r\nthe wilderness? In answer to this query, a rumor gained ground,—and,\r\nhowever absurd, was entertained by some very sensible people,—that\r\nHeaven had wrought an absolute miracle, by transporting an eminent\r\nDoctor of Physic, from a German university, bodily through the air,\r\nand setting him down at the door of Mr. Dimmesdale’s study!\r\nIndividuals of wiser faith, indeed, who knew that Heaven promotes its\r\npurposes without aiming at the stage-effect of what is called\r\nmiraculous interposition, were inclined to see a providential hand in\r\nRoger Chillingworth’s so opportune arrival.\r\n\r\nThis idea was countenanced by the strong interest which the physician\r\never manifested in the young clergyman; he attached himself to him as\r\na parishioner, and sought to win a friendly regard and confidence from\r\nhis naturally reserved sensibility. He expressed great alarm at his\r\npastor’s state of health, but was anxious to attempt the cure, and, if\r\nearly undertaken, seemed not despondent of a favorable result. The\r\nelders, the deacons, the motherly dames, and the young and fair\r\nmaidens, of Mr. Dimmesdale’s flock, were alike importunate that he\r\nshould make trial of the physician’s frankly offered skill. Mr.\r\nDimmesdale gently repelled their entreaties.\r\n\r\n“I need no medicine,” said he.\r\n\r\nBut how could the young minister say so, when, with every successive\r\nSabbath, his cheek was paler and thinner, and his voice more tremulous\r\nthan before,—when it had now become a constant habit, rather than a\r\ncasual gesture, to press his hand over his heart? Was he weary of his\r\nlabors? Did he wish to die? These questions were solemnly propounded\r\nto Mr. Dimmesdale by the elder ministers of Boston and the deacons of\r\nhis church, who, to use their own phrase, “dealt with him” on the sin\r\nof rejecting the aid which Providence so manifestly held out. He\r\nlistened in silence, and finally promised to confer with the\r\nphysician.\r\n\r\n“Were it God’s will,” said the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, when, in\r\nfulfilment of this pledge, he requested old Roger Chillingworth’s\r\nprofessional advice, “I could be well content, that my labors, and my\r\nsorrows, and my sins, and my pains, should shortly end with me, and\r\nwhat is earthly of them be buried in my grave, and the spiritual go\r\nwith me to my eternal state, rather than that you should put your\r\nskill to the proof in my behalf.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” replied Roger Chillingworth, with that quietness which, whether\r\nimposed or natural, marked all his deportment, “it is thus that a\r\nyoung clergyman is apt to speak. Youthful men, not having taken a deep\r\nroot, give up their hold of life so easily! And saintly men, who walk\r\nwith God on earth, would fain be away, to walk with him on the golden\r\npavements of the New Jerusalem.”\r\n\r\n“Nay,” rejoined the young minister, putting his hand to his heart,\r\nwith a flush of pain flitting over his brow, “were I worthier to walk\r\nthere, I could be better content to toil here.”\r\n\r\n“Good men ever interpret themselves too meanly,” said the physician.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Minister and Leech]\r\n\r\nIn this manner, the mysterious old Roger Chillingworth became the\r\nmedical adviser of the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale. As not only the\r\ndisease interested the physician, but he was strongly moved to look\r\ninto the character and qualities of the patient, these two men, so\r\ndifferent in age, came gradually to spend much time together. For the\r\nsake of the minister’s health, and to enable the leech to gather\r\nplants with healing balm in them, they took long walks on the\r\nsea-shore, or in the forest; mingling various talk with the plash and\r\nmurmur of the waves, and the solemn wind-anthem among the tree-tops.\r\nOften, likewise, one was the guest of the other, in his place of\r\nstudy and retirement. There was a fascination for the minister in the\r\ncompany of the man of science, in whom he recognized an intellectual\r\ncultivation of no moderate depth or scope; together with a range and\r\nfreedom of ideas, that he would have vainly looked for among the\r\nmembers of his own profession. In truth, he was startled, if not\r\nshocked, to find this attribute in the physician. Mr. Dimmesdale was a\r\ntrue priest, a true religionist, with the reverential sentiment\r\nlargely developed, and an order of mind that impelled itself\r\npowerfully along the track of a creed, and wore its passage\r\ncontinually deeper with the lapse of time. In no state of society\r\nwould he have been what is called a man of liberal views; it would\r\nalways be essential to his peace to feel the pressure of a faith about\r\nhim, supporting, while it confined him within its iron framework. Not\r\nthe less, however, though with a tremulous enjoyment, did he feel the\r\noccasional relief of looking at the universe through the medium of\r\nanother kind of intellect than those with which he habitually held\r\nconverse. It was as if a window were thrown open, admitting a freer\r\natmosphere into the close and stifled study, where his life was\r\nwasting itself away, amid lamplight, or obstructed day-beams, and the\r\nmusty fragrance, be it sensual or moral, that exhales from books. But\r\nthe air was too fresh and chill to be long breathed with comfort. So\r\nthe minister, and the physician with him, withdrew again within the\r\nlimits of what their church defined as orthodox.\r\n\r\nThus Roger Chillingworth scrutinized his patient carefully, both as he\r\nsaw him in his ordinary life, keeping an accustomed pathway in the\r\nrange of thoughts familiar to him, and as he appeared when thrown\r\namidst other moral scenery, the novelty of which might call out\r\nsomething new to the surface of his character. He deemed it essential,\r\nit would seem, to know the man, before attempting to do him good.\r\nWherever there is a heart and an intellect, the diseases of the\r\nphysical frame are tinged with the peculiarities of these. In Arthur\r\nDimmesdale, thought and imagination were so active, and sensibility so\r\nintense, that the bodily infirmity would be likely to have its\r\ngroundwork there. So Roger Chillingworth—the man of skill, the kind\r\nand friendly physician—strove to go deep into his patient’s bosom,\r\ndelving among his principles, prying into his recollections, and\r\nprobing everything with a cautious touch, like a treasure-seeker in a\r\ndark cavern. Few secrets can escape an investigator, who has\r\nopportunity and license to undertake such a quest, and skill to follow\r\nit up. A man burdened with a secret should especially avoid the\r\nintimacy of his physician. If the latter possess native sagacity, and\r\na nameless something more,—let us call it intuition; if he show no\r\nintrusive egotism, nor disagreeably prominent characteristics of his\r\nown; if he have the power, which must be born with him, to bring his\r\nmind into such affinity with his patient’s, that this last shall\r\nunawares have spoken what he imagines himself only to have thought; if\r\nsuch revelations be received without tumult, and acknowledged not so\r\noften by an uttered sympathy as by silence, an inarticulate breath,\r\nand here and there a word, to indicate that all is understood; if to\r\nthese qualifications of a confidant be joined the advantages afforded\r\nby his recognized character as a physician;—then, at some inevitable\r\nmoment, will the soul of the sufferer be dissolved, and flow forth in\r\na dark, but transparent stream, bringing all its mysteries into the\r\ndaylight.\r\n\r\nRoger Chillingworth possessed all, or most, of the attributes above\r\nenumerated. Nevertheless, time went on; a kind of intimacy, as we have\r\nsaid, grew up between these two cultivated minds, which had as wide a\r\nfield as the whole sphere of human thought and study, to meet upon;\r\nthey discussed every topic of ethics and religion, of public affairs\r\nand private character; they talked much, on both sides, of matters\r\nthat seemed personal to themselves; and yet no secret, such as the\r\nphysician fancied must exist there, ever stole out of the minister’s\r\nconsciousness into his companion’s ear. The latter had his suspicions,\r\nindeed, that even the nature of Mr. Dimmesdale’s bodily disease had\r\nnever fairly been revealed to him. It was a strange reserve!\r\n\r\nAfter a time, at a hint from Roger Chillingworth, the friends of Mr.\r\nDimmesdale effected an arrangement by which the two were lodged in the\r\nsame house; so that every ebb and flow of the minister’s life-tide\r\nmight pass under the eye of his anxious and attached physician. There\r\nwas much joy throughout the town, when this greatly desirable object\r\nwas attained. It was held to be the best possible measure for the\r\nyoung clergyman’s welfare; unless, indeed, as often urged by such as\r\nfelt authorized to do so, he had selected some one of the many\r\nblooming damsels, spiritually devoted to him, to become his devoted\r\nwife. This latter step, however, there was no present prospect that\r\nArthur Dimmesdale would be prevailed upon to take; he rejected all\r\nsuggestions of the kind, as if priestly celibacy were one of his\r\narticles of church-discipline. Doomed by his own choice, therefore, as\r\nMr. Dimmesdale so evidently was, to eat his unsavory morsel always at\r\nanother’s board, and endure the life-long chill which must be his lot\r\nwho seeks to warm himself only at another’s fireside, it truly seemed\r\nthat this sagacious, experienced, benevolent old physician, with his\r\nconcord of paternal and reverential love for the young pastor, was the\r\nvery man, of all mankind, to be constantly within reach of his voice.\r\n\r\nThe new abode of the two friends was with a pious widow, of good\r\nsocial rank, who dwelt in a house covering pretty nearly the site on\r\nwhich the venerable structure of King’s Chapel has since been built.\r\nIt had the graveyard, originally Isaac Johnson’s home-field, on one\r\nside, and so was well adapted to call up serious reflections, suited\r\nto their respective employments, in both minister and man of physic.\r\nThe motherly care of the good widow assigned to Mr. Dimmesdale a front\r\napartment, with a sunny exposure, and heavy window-curtains, to create\r\na noontide shadow, when desirable. The walls were hung round with\r\ntapestry, said to be from the Gobelin looms, and, at all events,\r\nrepresenting the Scriptural story of David and Bathsheba, and Nathan\r\nthe Prophet, in colors still unfaded, but which made the fair woman\r\nof the scene almost as grimly picturesque as the woe-denouncing seer.\r\nHere the pale clergyman piled up his library, rich with\r\nparchment-bound folios of the Fathers, and the lore of Rabbis, and\r\nmonkish erudition, of which the Protestant divines, even while they\r\nvilified and decried that class of writers, were yet constrained often\r\nto avail themselves. On the other side of the house old Roger\r\nChillingworth arranged his study and laboratory; not such as a modern\r\nman of science would reckon even tolerably complete, but provided with\r\na distilling apparatus, and the means of compounding drugs and\r\nchemicals, which the practised alchemist knew well how to turn to\r\npurpose. With such commodiousness of situation, these two learned\r\npersons sat themselves down, each in his own domain, yet familiarly\r\npassing from one apartment to the other, and bestowing a mutual and\r\nnot incurious inspection into one another’s business.\r\n\r\nAnd the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale’s best discerning friends, as we\r\nhave intimated, very reasonably imagined that the hand of Providence\r\nhad done all this, for the purpose—besought in so many public, and\r\ndomestic, and secret prayers—of restoring the young minister to\r\nhealth. But—it must now be said—another portion of the community had\r\nlatterly begun to take its own view of the relation betwixt Mr.\r\nDimmesdale and the mysterious old physician. When an uninstructed\r\nmultitude attempts to see with its eyes, it is exceedingly apt to be\r\ndeceived. When, however, it forms its judgment, as it usually does, on\r\nthe intuitions of its great and warm heart, the conclusions thus\r\nattained are often so profound and so unerring, as to possess the\r\ncharacter of truths supernaturally revealed. The people, in the case\r\nof which we speak, could justify its prejudice against Roger\r\nChillingworth by no fact or argument worthy of serious refutation.\r\nThere was an aged handicraftsman, it is true, who had been a citizen\r\nof London at the period of Sir Thomas Overbury’s murder, now some\r\nthirty years agone; he testified to having seen the physician, under\r\nsome other name, which the narrator of the story had now forgotten, in\r\ncompany with Doctor Forman, the famous old conjurer, who was\r\nimplicated in the affair of Overbury. Two or three individuals hinted,\r\nthat the man of skill, during his Indian captivity, had enlarged his\r\nmedical attainments by joining in the incantations of the savage\r\npriests; who were universally acknowledged to be powerful enchanters,\r\noften performing seemingly miraculous cures by their skill in the\r\nblack art. A large number—and many of these were persons of such\r\nsober sense and practical observation that their opinions would have\r\nbeen valuable, in other matters—affirmed that Roger Chillingworth’s\r\naspect had undergone a remarkable change while he had dwelt in town,\r\nand especially since his abode with Mr. Dimmesdale. At first, his\r\nexpression had been calm, meditative, scholar-like. Now, there was\r\nsomething ugly and evil in his face, which they had not previously\r\nnoticed, and which grew still the more obvious to sight, the oftener\r\nthey looked upon him. According to the vulgar idea, the fire in his\r\nlaboratory had been brought from the lower regions, and was fed with\r\ninfernal fuel; and so, as might be expected, his visage was getting\r\nsooty with the smoke.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the matter, it grew to be a widely diffused opinion, that\r\nthe Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, like many other personages of especial\r\nsanctity, in all ages of the Christian world, was haunted either by\r\nSatan himself, or Satan’s emissary, in the guise of old Roger\r\nChillingworth. This diabolical agent had the Divine permission, for a\r\nseason, to burrow into the clergyman’s intimacy, and plot against his\r\nsoul. No sensible man, it was confessed, could doubt on which side the\r\nvictory would turn. The people looked, with an unshaken hope, to see\r\nthe minister come forth out of the conflict, transfigured with the\r\nglory which he would unquestionably win. Meanwhile, nevertheless, it\r\nwas sad to think of the perchance mortal agony through which he must\r\nstruggle towards his triumph.\r\n\r\nAlas! to judge from the gloom and terror in the depths of the poor\r\nminister’s eyes, the battle was a sore one and the victory anything\r\nbut secure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\n [Illustration]"

      "content": "THE LEECH AND HIS PATIENT.\r\n\nOld Roger Chillingworth, throughout life, had been calm in\r\ntemperament, kindly, though not of warm affections, but ever, and in\r\nall his relations with the world, a pure and upright man. He had begun\r\nan investigation, as he imagined, with the severe and equal integrity\r\nof a judge, desirous only of truth, even as if the question involved\r\nno more than the air-drawn lines and figures of a geometrical problem,\r\ninstead of human passions, and wrongs inflicted on himself. But, as he\r\nproceeded, a terrible fascination, a kind of fierce, though still\r\ncalm, necessity, seized the old man within its gripe, and never set\r\nhim free again, until he had done all its bidding. He now dug into the\r\npoor clergyman’s heart, like a miner searching for gold; or, rather,\r\nlike a sexton delving into a grave, possibly in quest of a jewel that\r\nhad been buried on the dead man’s bosom, but likely to find nothing\r\nsave mortality and corruption. Alas for his own soul, if these were\r\nwhat he sought!\r\n\r\nSometimes, a light glimmered out of the physician’s eyes, burning blue\r\nand ominous, like the reflection of a furnace, or, let us say, like\r\none of those gleams of ghastly fire that darted from Bunyan’s awful\r\ndoorway in the hillside, and quivered on the pilgrim’s face. The soil\r\nwhere this dark miner was working had perchance shown indications that\r\nencouraged him.\r\n\r\n“This man,” said he, at one such moment, to himself, “pure as they\r\ndeem him,—all spiritual as he seems,—hath inherited a strong animal\r\nnature from his father or his mother. Let us dig a little further in\r\nthe direction of this vein!”\r\n\r\nThen, after long search into the minister’s dim interior, and turning\r\nover many precious materials, in the shape of high aspirations for the\r\nwelfare of his race, warm love of souls, pure sentiments, natural\r\npiety, strengthened by thought and study, and illuminated by\r\nrevelation,—all of which invaluable gold was perhaps no better than\r\nrubbish to the seeker,—he would turn back, discouraged, and begin his\r\nquest towards another point. He groped along as stealthily, with as\r\ncautious a tread, and as wary an outlook, as a thief entering a\r\nchamber where a man lies only half asleep,—or, it may be, broad\r\nawake,—with purpose to steal the very treasure which this man guards\r\nas the apple of his eye. In spite of his premeditated carefulness, the\r\nfloor would now and then creak; his garments would rustle; the shadow\r\nof his presence, in a forbidden proximity, would be thrown across his\r\nvictim. In other words, Mr. Dimmesdale, whose sensibility of nerve\r\noften produced the effect of spiritual intuition, would become vaguely\r\naware that something inimical to his peace had thrust itself into\r\nrelation with him. But old Roger Chillingworth, too, had perceptions\r\nthat were almost intuitive; and when the minister threw his startled\r\neyes towards him, there the physician sat; his kind, watchful,\r\nsympathizing, but never intrusive friend.\r\n\r\nYet Mr. Dimmesdale would perhaps have seen this individual’s character\r\nmore perfectly, if a certain morbidness, to which sick hearts are\r\nliable, had not rendered him suspicious of all mankind. Trusting no\r\nman as his friend, he could not recognize his enemy when the latter\r\nactually appeared. He therefore still kept up a familiar intercourse\r\nwith him, daily receiving the old physician in his study; or visiting\r\nthe laboratory, and, for recreation’s sake, watching the processes by\r\nwhich weeds were converted into drugs of potency.\r\n\r\nOne day, leaning his forehead on his hand, and his elbow on the sill\r\nof the open window, that looked towards the graveyard, he talked with\r\nRoger Chillingworth, while the old man was examining a bundle of\r\nunsightly plants.\r\n\r\n“Where,” asked he, with a look askance at them,—for it was the\r\nclergyman’s peculiarity that he seldom, nowadays, looked straightforth\r\nat any object, whether human or inanimate,—“where, my kind doctor,\r\ndid you gather those herbs, with such a dark, flabby leaf?”\r\n\r\n“Even in the graveyard here at hand,” answered the physician,\r\ncontinuing his employment. “They are new to me. I found them growing\r\non a grave, which bore no tombstone, nor other memorial of the dead\r\nman, save these ugly weeds, that have taken upon themselves to keep\r\nhim in remembrance. They grew out of his heart, and typify, it may be,\r\nsome hideous secret that was buried with him, and which he had done\r\nbetter to confess during his lifetime.”\r\n\r\n“Perchance,” said Mr. Dimmesdale, “he earnestly desired it, but could\r\nnot.”\r\n\r\n“And wherefore?” rejoined the physician. “Wherefore not; since all the\r\npowers of nature call so earnestly for the confession of sin, that\r\nthese black weeds have sprung up out of a buried heart, to make\r\nmanifest an unspoken crime?”\r\n\r\n“That, good Sir, is but a fantasy of yours,” replied the minister.\r\n“There can be, if I forebode aright, no power, short of the Divine\r\nmercy, to disclose, whether by uttered words, or by type or emblem,\r\nthe secrets that may be buried with a human heart. The heart, making\r\nitself guilty of such secrets, must perforce hold them, until the day\r\nwhen all hidden things shall be revealed. Nor have I so read or\r\ninterpreted Holy Writ, as to understand that the disclosure of human\r\nthoughts and deeds, then to be made, is intended as a part of the\r\nretribution. That, surely, were a shallow view of it. No; these\r\nrevelations, unless I greatly err, are meant merely to promote the\r\nintellectual satisfaction of all intelligent beings, who will stand\r\nwaiting, on that day, to see the dark problem of this life made plain.\r\nA knowledge of men’s hearts will be needful to the completest solution\r\nof that problem. And I conceive, moreover, that the hearts holding\r\nsuch miserable secrets as you speak of will yield them up, at that\r\nlast day, not with reluctance, but with a joy unutterable.”\r\n\r\n“Then why not reveal them here?” asked Roger Chillingworth, glancing\r\nquietly aside at the minister. “Why should not the guilty ones sooner\r\navail themselves of this unutterable solace?”\r\n\r\n“They mostly do,” said the clergyman, griping hard at his breast as if\r\nafflicted with an importunate throb of pain. “Many, many a poor soul\r\nhath given its confidence to me, not only on the death-bed, but while\r\nstrong in life, and fair in reputation. And ever, after such an\r\noutpouring, O, what a relief have I witnessed in those sinful\r\nbrethren! even as in one who at last draws free air, after long\r\nstifling with his own polluted breath. How can it be otherwise? Why\r\nshould a wretched man, guilty, we will say, of murder, prefer to keep\r\nthe dead corpse buried in his own heart, rather than fling it forth at\r\nonce, and let the universe take care of it!”\r\n\r\n“Yet some men bury their secrets thus,” observed the calm physician.\r\n\r\n“True; there are such men,” answered Mr. Dimmesdale. “But, not to\r\nsuggest more obvious reasons, it may be that they are kept silent by\r\nthe very constitution of their nature. Or,—can we not suppose\r\nit?—guilty as they may be, retaining, nevertheless, a zeal for God’s\r\nglory and man’s welfare, they shrink from displaying themselves black\r\nand filthy in the view of men; because, thenceforward, no good can be\r\nachieved by them; no evil of the past be redeemed by better service.\r\nSo, to their own unutterable torment, they go about among their\r\nfellow-creatures, looking pure as new-fallen snow while their hearts\r\nare all speckled and spotted with iniquity of which they cannot rid\r\nthemselves.”\r\n\r\n“These men deceive themselves,” said Roger Chillingworth, with\r\nsomewhat more emphasis than usual, and making a slight gesture with\r\nhis forefinger. “They fear to take up the shame that rightfully\r\nbelongs to them. Their love for man, their zeal for God’s\r\nservice,—these holy impulses may or may not coexist in their hearts\r\nwith the evil inmates to which their guilt has unbarred the door, and\r\nwhich must needs propagate a hellish breed within them. But, if they\r\nseek to glorify God, let them not lift heavenward their unclean hands!\r\nIf they would serve their fellow-men, let them do it by making\r\nmanifest the power and reality of conscience, in constraining them to\r\npenitential self-abasement! Wouldst thou have me to believe, O wise\r\nand pious friend, that a false show can be better—can be more for\r\nGod’s glory, or man’s welfare—than God’s own truth? Trust me, such\r\nmen deceive themselves!”\r\n\r\n“It may be so,” said the young clergyman, indifferently, as waiving a\r\ndiscussion that he considered irrelevant or unseasonable. He had a\r\nready faculty, indeed, of escaping from any topic that agitated his\r\ntoo sensitive and nervous temperament.—“But, now, I would ask of my\r\nwell-skilled physician, whether, in good sooth, he deems me to have\r\nprofited by his kindly care of this weak frame of mine?”\r\n\r\nBefore Roger Chillingworth could answer, they heard the clear, wild\r\nlaughter of a young child’s voice, proceeding from the adjacent\r\nburial-ground. Looking instinctively from the open window,—for it was\r\nsummer-time,—the minister beheld Hester Prynne and little Pearl\r\npassing along the footpath that traversed the enclosure. Pearl looked\r\nas beautiful as the day, but was in one of those moods of perverse\r\nmerriment which, whenever they occurred, seemed to remove her entirely\r\nout of the sphere of sympathy or human contact. She now skipped\r\nirreverently from one grave to another; until, coming to the broad,\r\nflat, armorial tombstone of a departed worthy,—perhaps of Isaac\r\nJohnson himself,—she began to dance upon it. In reply to her mother’s\r\ncommand and entreaty that she would behave more decorously, little\r\nPearl paused to gather the prickly burrs from a tall burdock which\r\ngrew beside the tomb. Taking a handful of these, she arranged them\r\nalong the lines of the scarlet letter that decorated the maternal\r\nbosom, to which the burrs, as their nature was, tenaciously adhered.\r\nHester did not pluck them off.\r\n\r\nRoger Chillingworth had by this time approached the window, and smiled\r\ngrimly down.\r\n\r\n“There is no law, nor reverence for authority, no regard for human\r\nordinances or opinions, right or wrong, mixed up with that child’s\r\ncomposition,” remarked he, as much to himself as to his companion. “I\r\nsaw her, the other day, bespatter the Governor himself with water, at\r\nthe cattle-trough in Spring Lane. What, in Heaven’s name, is she? Is\r\nthe imp altogether evil? Hath she affections? Hath she any\r\ndiscoverable principle of being?”\r\n\r\n“None, save the freedom of a broken law,” answered Mr. Dimmesdale, in\r\na quiet way, as if he had been discussing the point within himself.\r\n“Whether capable of good, I know not.”\r\n\r\nThe child probably overheard their voices; for, looking up to the\r\nwindow, with a bright, but naughty smile of mirth and intelligence,\r\nshe threw one of the prickly burrs at the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale. The\r\nsensitive clergyman shrunk, with nervous dread, from the light\r\nmissile. Detecting his emotion, Pearl clapped her little hands, in the\r\nmost extravagant ecstasy. Hester Prynne, likewise, had involuntarily\r\nlooked up; and all these four persons, old and young, regarded one\r\nanother in silence, till the child laughed aloud, and shouted,—“Come\r\naway, mother! Come away, or yonder old Black Man will catch you! He\r\nhath got hold of the minister already. Come away, mother, or he will\r\ncatch you! But he cannot catch little Pearl!”\r\n\r\nSo she drew her mother away, skipping, dancing, and frisking\r\nfantastically, among the hillocks of the dead people, like a creature\r\nthat had nothing in common with a bygone and buried generation, nor\r\nowned herself akin to it. It was as if she had been made afresh, out\r\nof new elements, and must perforce be permitted to live her own life,\r\nand be a law unto herself, without her eccentricities being reckoned\r\nto her for a crime.\r\n\r\n“There goes a woman,” resumed Roger Chillingworth, after a pause,\r\n“who, be her demerits what they may, hath none of that mystery of\r\nhidden sinfulness which you deem so grievous to be borne. Is Hester\r\nPrynne the less miserable, think you, for that scarlet letter on her\r\nbreast?”\r\n\r\n“I do verily believe it,” answered the clergyman. “Nevertheless, I\r\ncannot answer for her. There was a look of pain in her face, which I\r\nwould gladly have been spared the sight of. But still, methinks, it\r\nmust needs be better for the sufferer to be free to show his pain, as\r\nthis poor woman Hester is, than to cover it all up in his heart.”\r\n\r\nThere was another pause; and the physician began anew to examine and\r\narrange the plants which he had gathered.\r\n\r\n“You inquired of me, a little time agone,” said he, at length, “my\r\njudgment as touching your health.”\r\n\r\n“I did,” answered the clergyman, “and would gladly learn it. Speak\r\nfrankly, I pray you, be it for life or death.”\r\n\r\n“Freely, then, and plainly,” said the physician, still busy with his\r\nplants, but keeping a wary eye on Mr. Dimmesdale, “the disorder is a\r\nstrange one; not so much in itself, nor as outwardly manifested,—in\r\nso far, at least, as the symptoms have been laid open to my\r\nobservation. Looking daily at you, my good Sir, and watching the\r\ntokens of your aspect, now for months gone by, I should deem you a man\r\nsore sick, it may be, yet not so sick but that an instructed and\r\nwatchful physician might well hope to cure you. But—I know not what\r\nto say—the disease is what I seem to know, yet know it not.”\r\n\r\n“You speak in riddles, learned Sir,” said the pale minister, glancing\r\naside out of the window.\r\n\r\n“Then, to speak more plainly,” continued the physician, “and I crave\r\npardon, Sir,—should it seem to require pardon,—for this needful\r\nplainness of my speech. Let me ask,—as your friend,—as one having\r\ncharge, under Providence, of your life and physical well-being,—hath\r\nall the operation of this disorder been fairly laid open and recounted\r\nto me?”\r\n\r\n“How can you question it?” asked the minister. “Surely, it were\r\nchild’s play, to call in a physician, and then hide the sore!”\r\n\r\n“You would tell me, then, that I know all?” said Roger Chillingworth,\r\ndeliberately, and fixing an eye, bright with intense and concentrated\r\nintelligence, on the minister’s face. “Be it so! But, again! He to\r\nwhom only the outward and physical evil is laid open, knoweth,\r\noftentimes, but half the evil which he is called upon to cure. A\r\nbodily disease, which we look upon as whole and entire within itself,\r\nmay, after all, be but a symptom of some ailment in the spiritual\r\npart. Your pardon, once again, good Sir, if my speech give the shadow\r\nof offence. You, Sir, of all men whom I have known, are he whose body\r\nis the closest conjoined, and imbued, and identified, so to speak,\r\nwith the spirit whereof it is the instrument.”\r\n\r\n“Then I need ask no further,” said the clergyman, somewhat hastily\r\nrising from his chair. “You deal not, I take it, in medicine for the\r\nsoul!”\r\n\r\n“Thus, a sickness,” continued Roger Chillingworth, going on, in an\r\nunaltered tone, without heeding the interruption,—but standing up,\r\nand confronting the emaciated and white-cheeked minister, with his\r\nlow, dark, and misshapen figure,—“a sickness, a sore place, if we may\r\nso call it, in your spirit, hath immediately its appropriate\r\nmanifestation in your bodily frame. Would you, therefore, that your\r\nphysician heal the bodily evil? How may this be, unless you first lay\r\nopen to him the wound or trouble in your soul?”\r\n\r\n“No!—not to thee!—not to an earthly physician!” cried Mr.\r\nDimmesdale, passionately, and turning his eyes, full and bright, and\r\nwith a kind of fierceness, on old Roger Chillingworth. “Not to thee!\r\nBut if it be the soul’s disease, then do I commit myself to the one\r\nPhysician of the soul! He, if it stand with his good pleasure, can\r\ncure; or he can kill! Let him do with me as, in his justice and\r\nwisdom, he shall see good. But who art thou, that meddlest in this\r\nmatter?—that dares thrust himself between the sufferer and his God?”\r\n\r\nWith a frantic gesture he rushed out of the room.\r\n\r\n“It is as well to have made this step,” said Roger Chillingworth to\r\nhimself, looking after the minister with a grave smile. “There is\r\nnothing lost. We shall be friends again anon. But see, now, how\r\npassion takes hold upon this man, and hurrieth him out of himself! As\r\nwith one passion, so with another! He hath done a wild thing erenow,\r\nthis pious Master Dimmesdale, in the hot passion of his heart!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Leech and his Patient]\r\n\r\nIt proved not difficult to re-establish the intimacy of the two\r\ncompanions, on the same footing and in the same degree as heretofore.\r\nThe young clergyman, after a few hours of privacy, was sensible that\r\nthe disorder of his nerves had hurried him into an unseemly outbreak\r\nof temper, which there had been nothing in the physician’s words to\r\nexcuse or palliate. He marvelled, indeed, at the violence with which\r\nhe had thrust back the kind old man, when merely proffering the advice\r\nwhich it was his duty to bestow, and which the minister himself had\r\nexpressly sought. With these remorseful feelings, he lost no time in\r\nmaking the amplest apologies, and besought his friend still to\r\ncontinue the care, which, if not successful in restoring him to\r\nhealth, had, in all probability, been the means of prolonging his\r\nfeeble existence to that hour. Roger Chillingworth readily assented,\r\nand went on with his medical supervision of the minister; doing his\r\nbest for him, in all good faith, but always quitting the patient’s\r\napartment, at the close of a professional interview, with a mysterious\r\nand puzzled smile upon his lips. This expression was invisible in Mr.\r\nDimmesdale’s presence, but grew strongly evident as the physician\r\ncrossed the threshold.\r\n\r\n“A rare case!” he muttered. “I must needs look deeper into it. A\r\nstrange sympathy betwixt soul and body! Were it only for the art’s\r\nsake, I must search this matter to the bottom!”\r\n\r\nIt came to pass, not long after the scene above recorded, that the\r\nReverend Mr. Dimmesdale, at noonday, and entirely unawares, fell into\r\na deep, deep slumber, sitting in his chair, with a large black-letter\r\nvolume open before him on the table. It must have been a work of vast\r\nability in the somniferous school of literature. The profound depth of\r\nthe minister’s repose was the more remarkable, inasmuch as he was one\r\nof those persons whose sleep, ordinarily, is as light, as fitful, and\r\nas easily scared away, as a small bird hopping on a twig. To such an\r\nunwonted remoteness, however, had his spirit now withdrawn into\r\nitself, that he stirred not in his chair, when old Roger\r\nChillingworth, without any extraordinary precaution, came into the\r\nroom. The physician advanced directly in front of his patient, laid\r\nhis hand upon his bosom, and thrust aside the vestment, that,\r\nhitherto, had always covered it even from the professional eye.\r\n\r\nThen, indeed, Mr. Dimmesdale shuddered, and slightly stirred.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief pause, the physician turned away.\r\n\r\nBut, with what a wild look of wonder, joy, and horror! With what a\r\nghastly rapture, as it were, too mighty to be expressed only by the\r\neye and features, and therefore bursting forth through the whole\r\nugliness of his figure, and making itself even riotously manifest by\r\nthe extravagant gestures with which he threw up his arms towards the\r\nceiling, and stamped his foot upon the floor! Had a man seen old\r\nRoger Chillingworth, at that moment of his ecstasy, he would have had\r\nno need to ask how Satan comports himself, when a precious human soul\r\nis lost to heaven, and won into his kingdom.\r\n\r\nBut what distinguished the physician’s ecstasy from Satan’s was the\r\ntrait of wonder in it!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\n [Illustration]"

      "content": "THE INTERIOR OF A HEART.\r\n\nAfter the incident last described, the intercourse between the\r\nclergyman and the physician, though externally the same, was really of\r\nanother character than it had previously been. The intellect of Roger\r\nChillingworth had now a sufficiently plain path before it. It was not,\r\nindeed, precisely that which he had laid out for himself to tread.\r\nCalm, gentle, passionless, as he appeared, there was yet, we fear, a\r\nquiet depth of malice, hitherto latent, but active now, in this\r\nunfortunate old man, which led him to imagine a more intimate revenge\r\nthan any mortal had ever wreaked upon an enemy. To make himself the\r\none trusted friend, to whom should be confided all the fear, the\r\nremorse, the agony, the ineffectual repentance, the backward rush of\r\nsinful thoughts, expelled in vain! All that guilty sorrow, hidden from\r\nthe world, whose great heart would have pitied and forgiven, to be\r\nrevealed to him, the Pitiless, to him, the Unforgiving! All that dark\r\ntreasure to be lavished on the very man, to whom nothing else could so\r\nadequately pay the debt of vengeance!\r\n\r\nThe clergyman’s shy and sensitive reserve had balked this scheme.\r\nRoger Chillingworth, however, was inclined to be hardly, if at all,\r\nless satisfied with the aspect of affairs, which Providence—using the\r\navenger and his victim for its own purposes, and, perchance, pardoning\r\nwhere it seemed most to punish—had substituted for his black devices.\r\nA revelation, he could almost say, had been granted to him. It\r\nmattered little, for his object, whether celestial, or from what other\r\nregion. By its aid, in all the subsequent relations betwixt him and\r\nMr. Dimmesdale, not merely the external presence, but the very inmost\r\nsoul, of the latter, seemed to be brought out before his eyes, so that\r\nhe could see and comprehend its every movement. He became,\r\nthenceforth, not a spectator only, but a chief actor, in the poor\r\nminister’s interior world. He could play upon him as he chose. Would\r\nhe arouse him with a throb of agony? The victim was forever on the\r\nrack; it needed only to know the spring that controlled the\r\nengine;—and the physician knew it well! Would he startle him with\r\nsudden fear? As at the waving of a magician’s wand, uprose a grisly\r\nphantom,—uprose a thousand phantoms,—in many shapes, of death, or\r\nmore awful shame, all flocking round about the clergyman, and pointing\r\nwith their fingers at his breast!\r\n\r\nAll this was accomplished with a subtlety so perfect, that the\r\nminister, though he had constantly a dim perception of some evil\r\ninfluence watching over him, could never gain a knowledge of its\r\nactual nature. True, he looked doubtfully, fearfully,—even, at times,\r\nwith horror and the bitterness of hatred,—at the deformed figure of\r\nthe old physician. His gestures, his gait, his grizzled beard, his\r\nslightest and most indifferent acts, the very fashion of his garments,\r\nwere odious in the clergyman’s sight; a token implicitly to be relied\r\non, of a deeper antipathy in the breast of the latter than he was\r\nwilling to acknowledge to himself. For, as it was impossible to assign\r\na reason for such distrust and abhorrence, so Mr. Dimmesdale,\r\nconscious that the poison of one morbid spot was infecting his heart’s\r\nentire substance, attributed all his presentiments to no other cause.\r\nHe took himself to task for his bad sympathies in reference to Roger\r\nChillingworth, disregarded the lesson that he should have drawn from\r\nthem, and did his best to root them out. Unable to accomplish this, he\r\nnevertheless, as a matter of principle, continued his habits of social\r\nfamiliarity with the old man, and thus gave him constant opportunities\r\nfor perfecting the purpose to which—poor, forlorn creature that he\r\nwas, and more wretched than his victim—the avenger had devoted\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nWhile thus suffering under bodily disease, and gnawed and tortured by\r\nsome black trouble of the soul, and given over to the machinations of\r\nhis deadliest enemy, the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale had achieved a\r\nbrilliant popularity in his sacred office. He won it, indeed, in great\r\npart, by his sorrows. His intellectual gifts, his moral perceptions,\r\nhis power of experiencing and communicating emotion, were kept in a\r\nstate of preternatural activity by the prick and anguish of his daily\r\nlife. His fame, though still on its upward slope, already overshadowed\r\nthe soberer reputations of his fellow-clergymen, eminent as several of\r\nthem were. There were scholars among them, who had spent more years in\r\nacquiring abstruse lore, connected with the divine profession, than\r\nMr. Dimmesdale had lived; and who might well, therefore, be more\r\nprofoundly versed in such solid and valuable attainments than their\r\nyouthful brother. There were men, too, of a sturdier texture of mind\r\nthan his, and endowed with a far greater share of shrewd, hard, iron,\r\nor granite understanding; which, duly mingled with a fair proportion\r\nof doctrinal ingredient, constitutes a highly respectable,\r\nefficacious, and unamiable variety of the clerical species. There were\r\nothers, again, true saintly fathers, whose faculties had been\r\nelaborated by weary toil among their books, and by patient thought,\r\nand etherealized, moreover, by spiritual communications with the\r\nbetter world, into which their purity of life had almost introduced\r\nthese holy personages, with their garments of mortality still clinging\r\nto them. All that they lacked was the gift that descended upon the\r\nchosen disciples at Pentecost, in tongues of flame; symbolizing, it\r\nwould seem, not the power of speech in foreign and unknown languages,\r\nbut that of addressing the whole human brotherhood in the heart’s\r\nnative language. These fathers, otherwise so apostolic, lacked\r\nHeaven’s last and rarest attestation of their office, the Tongue of\r\nFlame. They would have vainly sought—had they ever dreamed of\r\nseeking—to express the highest truths through the humblest medium of\r\nfamiliar words and images. Their voices came down, afar and\r\nindistinctly, from the upper heights where they habitually dwelt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Virgins of the Church]\r\n\r\nNot improbably, it was to this latter class of men that Mr.\r\nDimmesdale, by many of his traits of character, naturally belonged. To\r\nthe high mountain-peaks of faith and sanctity he would have climbed,\r\nhad not the tendency been thwarted by the burden, whatever it might\r\nbe, of crime or anguish, beneath which it was his doom to totter. It\r\nkept him down, on a level with the lowest; him, the man of ethereal\r\nattributes, whose voice the angels might else have listened to and\r\nanswered! But this very burden it was, that gave him sympathies so\r\nintimate with the sinful brotherhood of mankind; so that his heart\r\nvibrated in unison with theirs, and received their pain into itself,\r\nand sent its own throb of pain through a thousand other hearts, in\r\ngushes of sad, persuasive eloquence. Oftenest persuasive, but\r\nsometimes terrible! The people knew not the power that moved them\r\nthus. They deemed the young clergyman a miracle of holiness. They\r\nfancied him the mouthpiece of Heaven’s messages of wisdom, and rebuke,\r\nand love. In their eyes, the very ground on which he trod was\r\nsanctified. The virgins of his church grew pale around him, victims of\r\na passion so imbued with religious sentiment that they imagined it to\r\nbe all religion, and brought it openly, in their white bosoms, as\r\ntheir most acceptable sacrifice before the altar. The aged members of\r\nhis flock, beholding Mr. Dimmesdale’s frame so feeble, while they were\r\nthemselves so rugged in their infirmity, believed that he would go\r\nheavenward before them, and enjoined it upon their children, that\r\ntheir old bones should be buried close to their young pastor’s holy\r\ngrave. And, all this time, perchance, when poor Mr. Dimmesdale was\r\nthinking of his grave, he questioned with himself whether the grass\r\nwould ever grow on it, because an accursed thing must there be buried!\r\n\r\nIt is inconceivable, the agony with which this public veneration\r\ntortured him! It was his genuine impulse to adore the truth, and to\r\nreckon all things shadow-like, and utterly devoid of weight or value,\r\nthat had not its divine essence as the life within their life. Then,\r\nwhat was he?—a substance?—or the dimmest of all shadows? He longed\r\nto speak out, from his own pulpit, at the full height of his voice,\r\nand tell the people what he was. “I, whom you behold in these black\r\ngarments of the priesthood,—I, who ascend the sacred desk, and turn\r\nmy pale face heavenward, taking upon myself to hold communion, in your\r\nbehalf, with the Most High Omniscience,—I, in whose daily life you\r\ndiscern the sanctity of Enoch,—I, whose footsteps, as you suppose,\r\nleave a gleam along my earthly track, whereby the pilgrims that shall\r\ncome after me may be guided to the regions of the blest,—I, who have\r\nlaid the hand of baptism upon your children,—I, who have breathed the\r\nparting prayer over your dying friends, to whom the Amen sounded\r\nfaintly from a world which they had quitted,—I, your pastor, whom you\r\nso reverence and trust, am utterly a pollution and a lie!”\r\n\r\nMore than once, Mr. Dimmesdale had gone into the pulpit, with a\r\npurpose never to come down its steps, until he should have spoken\r\nwords like the above. More than once, he had cleared his throat, and\r\ndrawn in the long, deep, and tremulous breath, which, when sent forth\r\nagain, would come burdened with the black secret of his soul. More\r\nthan once—nay, more than a hundred times—he had actually spoken!\r\nSpoken! But how? He had told his hearers that he was altogether vile,\r\na viler companion of the vilest, the worst of sinners, an abomination,\r\na thing of unimaginable iniquity; and that the only wonder was, that\r\nthey did not see his wretched body shrivelled up before their eyes, by\r\nthe burning wrath of the Almighty! Could there be plainer speech than\r\nthis? Would not the people start up in their seats, by a simultaneous\r\nimpulse, and tear him down out of the pulpit which he defiled? Not so,\r\nindeed! They heard it all, and did but reverence him the more. They\r\nlittle guessed what deadly purport lurked in those self-condemning\r\nwords. “The godly youth!” said they among themselves. “The saint on\r\nearth! Alas, if he discern such sinfulness in his own white soul, what\r\nhorrid spectacle would he behold in thine or mine!” The minister well\r\nknew—subtle, but remorseful hypocrite that he was!—the light in\r\nwhich his vague confession would be viewed. He had striven to put a\r\ncheat upon himself by making the avowal of a guilty conscience, but\r\nhad gained only one other sin, and a self-acknowledged shame, without\r\nthe momentary relief of being self-deceived. He had spoken the very\r\ntruth, and transformed it into the veriest falsehood. And yet, by the\r\nconstitution of his nature, he loved the truth, and loathed the lie,\r\nas few men ever did. Therefore, above all things else, he loathed his\r\nmiserable self!\r\n\r\nHis inward trouble drove him to practices more in accordance with the\r\nold, corrupted faith of Rome, than with the better light of the church\r\nin which he had been born and bred. In Mr. Dimmesdale’s secret closet,\r\nunder lock and key, there was a bloody scourge. Oftentimes, this\r\nProtestant and Puritan divine had plied it on his own shoulders;\r\nlaughing bitterly at himself the while, and smiting so much the more\r\npitilessly because of that bitter laugh. It was his custom, too, as it\r\nhas been that of many other pious Puritans, to fast,—not, however,\r\nlike them, in order to purify the body and render it the fitter medium\r\nof celestial illumination, but rigorously, and until his knees\r\ntrembled beneath him, as an act of penance. He kept vigils, likewise,\r\nnight after night, sometimes in utter darkness; sometimes with a\r\nglimmering lamp; and sometimes, viewing his own face in a\r\nlooking-glass, by the most powerful light which he could throw upon\r\nit. He thus typified the constant introspection wherewith he tortured,\r\nbut could not purify, himself. In these lengthened vigils, his brain\r\noften reeled, and visions seemed to flit before him; perhaps seen\r\ndoubtfully, and by a faint light of their own, in the remote dimness\r\nof the chamber, or more vividly, and close beside him, within the\r\nlooking-glass. Now it was a herd of diabolic shapes, that grinned and\r\nmocked at the pale minister, and beckoned him away with them; now a\r\ngroup of shining angels, who flew upward heavily, as sorrow-laden, but\r\ngrew more ethereal as they rose. Now came the dead friends of his\r\nyouth, and his white-bearded father, with a saint-like frown, and his\r\nmother, turning her face away as she passed by. Ghost of a\r\nmother,—thinnest fantasy of a mother,—methinks she might yet have\r\nthrown a pitying glance towards her son! And now, through the chamber\r\nwhich these spectral thoughts had made so ghastly, glided Hester\r\nPrynne, leading along little Pearl, in her scarlet garb, and pointing\r\nher forefinger, first at the scarlet letter on her bosom, and then at\r\nthe clergyman’s own breast.\r\n\r\nNone of these visions ever quite deluded him. At any moment, by an\r\neffort of his will, he could discern substances through their misty\r\nlack of substance, and convince himself that they were not solid in\r\ntheir nature, like yonder table of carved oak, or that big, square,\r\nleathern-bound and brazen-clasped volume of divinity. But, for all\r\nthat, they were, in one sense, the truest and most substantial things\r\nwhich the poor minister now dealt with. It is the unspeakable misery\r\nof a life so false as his, that it steals the pith and substance out\r\nof whatever realities there are around us, and which were meant by\r\nHeaven to be the spirit’s joy and nutriment. To the untrue man, the\r\nwhole universe is false,—it is impalpable,—it shrinks to nothing\r\nwithin his grasp. And he himself, in so far as he shows himself in a\r\nfalse light, becomes a shadow, or, indeed, ceases to exist. The only\r\ntruth that continued to give Mr. Dimmesdale a real existence on this\r\nearth, was the anguish in his inmost soul, and the undissembled\r\nexpression of it in his aspect. Had he once found power to smile, and\r\nwear a face of gayety, there would have been no such man!\r\n\r\nOn one of those ugly nights, which we have faintly hinted at, but\r\nforborne to picture forth, the minister started from his chair. A new\r\nthought had struck him. There might be a moment’s peace in it.\r\nAttiring himself with as much care as if it had been for public\r\nworship, and precisely in the same manner, he stole softly down the\r\nstaircase, undid the door, and issued forth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\n [Illustration]"

      "content": "THE MINISTER’S VIGIL.\r\n\nWalking in the shadow of a dream, as it were, and perhaps actually\r\nunder the influence of a species of somnambulism, Mr. Dimmesdale\r\nreached the spot where, now so long since, Hester Prynne had lived\r\nthrough her first hours of public ignominy. The same platform or\r\nscaffold, black and weather-stained with the storm or sunshine of\r\nseven long years, and foot-worn, too, with the tread of many culprits\r\nwho had since ascended it, remained standing beneath the balcony of\r\nthe meeting-house. The minister went up the steps.\r\n\r\nIt was an obscure night of early May. An unvaried pall of cloud\r\nmuffled the whole expanse of sky from zenith to horizon. If the same\r\nmultitude which had stood as eye-witnesses while Hester Prynne\r\nsustained her punishment could now have been summoned forth, they\r\nwould have discerned no face above the platform, nor hardly the\r\noutline of a human shape, in the dark gray of the midnight. But the\r\ntown was all asleep. There was no peril of discovery. The minister\r\nmight stand there, if it so pleased him, until morning should redden\r\nin the east, without other risk than that the dank and chill night-air\r\nwould creep into his frame, and stiffen his joints with rheumatism,\r\nand clog his throat with catarrh and cough; thereby defrauding the\r\nexpectant audience of to-morrow’s prayer and sermon. No eye could see\r\nhim, save that ever-wakeful one which had seen him in his closet,\r\nwielding the bloody scourge. Why, then, had he come hither? Was it but\r\nthe mockery of penitence? A mockery, indeed, but in which his soul\r\ntrifled with itself! A mockery at which angels blushed and wept, while\r\nfiends rejoiced, with jeering laughter! He had been driven hither by\r\nthe impulse of that Remorse which dogged him everywhere, and whose own\r\nsister and closely linked companion was that Cowardice which\r\ninvariably drew him back, with her tremulous gripe, just when the\r\nother impulse had hurried him to the verge of a disclosure. Poor,\r\nmiserable man! what right had infirmity like his to burden itself with\r\ncrime? Crime is for the iron-nerved, who have their choice either to\r\nendure it, or, if it press too hard, to exert their fierce and savage\r\nstrength for a good purpose, and fling it off at once! This feeble and\r\nmost sensitive of spirits could do neither, yet continually did one\r\nthing or another, which intertwined, in the same inextricable knot,\r\nthe agony of heaven-defying guilt and vain repentance.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, while standing on the scaffold, in this vain show of\r\nexpiation, Mr. Dimmesdale was overcome with a great horror of mind, as\r\nif the universe were gazing at a scarlet token on his naked breast,\r\nright over his heart. On that spot, in very truth, there was, and\r\nthere had long been, the gnawing and poisonous tooth of bodily pain.\r\nWithout any effort of his will, or power to restrain himself, he\r\nshrieked aloud; an outcry that went pealing through the night, and\r\nwas beaten back from one house to another, and reverberated from the\r\nhills in the background; as if a company of devils, detecting so much\r\nmisery and terror in it, had made a plaything of the sound, and were\r\nbandying it to and fro.\r\n\r\n“It is done!” muttered the minister, covering his face with his hands.\r\n“The whole town will awake, and hurry forth, and find me here!”\r\n\r\nBut it was not so. The shriek had perhaps sounded with a far greater\r\npower, to his own startled ears, than it actually possessed. The town\r\ndid not awake; or, if it did, the drowsy slumberers mistook the cry\r\neither for something frightful in a dream, or for the noise of\r\nwitches; whose voices, at that period, were often heard to pass over\r\nthe settlements or lonely cottages, as they rode with Satan through\r\nthe air. The clergyman, therefore, hearing no symptoms of disturbance,\r\nuncovered his eyes and looked about him. At one of the chamber-windows\r\nof Governor Bellingham’s mansion, which stood at some distance, on the\r\nline of another street, he beheld the appearance of the old magistrate\r\nhimself, with a lamp in his hand, a white night-cap on his head, and a\r\nlong white gown enveloping his figure. He looked like a ghost, evoked\r\nunseasonably from the grave. The cry had evidently startled him. At\r\nanother window of the same house, moreover, appeared old Mistress\r\nHibbins, the Governor’s sister, also with a lamp, which, even thus far\r\noff, revealed the expression of her sour and discontented face. She\r\nthrust forth her head from the lattice, and looked anxiously upward.\r\nBeyond the shadow of a doubt, this venerable witch-lady had heard Mr.\r\nDimmesdale’s outcry, and interpreted it, with its multitudinous echoes\r\nand reverberations, as the clamor of the fiends and night-hags, with\r\nwhom she was well known to make excursions into the forest.\r\n\r\nDetecting the gleam of Governor Bellingham’s lamp, the old lady\r\nquickly extinguished her own, and vanished. Possibly, she went up\r\namong the clouds. The minister saw nothing further of her motions. The\r\nmagistrate, after a wary observation of the darkness,—into which,\r\nnevertheless, he could see but little further than he might into a\r\nmill-stone,—retired from the window.\r\n\r\nThe minister grew comparatively calm. His eyes, however, were soon\r\ngreeted by a little, glimmering light, which, at first a long way off,\r\nwas approaching up the street. It threw a gleam of recognition on here\r\na post, and there a garden-fence, and here a latticed window-pane, and\r\nthere a pump, with its full trough of water, and here, again, an\r\narched door of oak, with an iron knocker, and a rough log for the\r\ndoorstep. The Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale noted all these minute\r\nparticulars, even while firmly convinced that the doom of his\r\nexistence was stealing onward, in the footsteps which he now heard;\r\nand that the gleam of the lantern would fall upon him, in a few\r\nmoments more, and reveal his long-hidden secret. As the light drew\r\nnearer, he beheld, within its illuminated circle, his brother\r\nclergyman,—or, to speak more accurately, his professional father, as\r\nwell as highly valued friend,—the Reverend Mr. Wilson; who, as Mr.\r\nDimmesdale now conjectured, had been praying at the bedside of some\r\ndying man. And so he had. The good old minister came freshly from the\r\ndeath-chamber of Governor Winthrop, who had passed from earth to\r\nheaven within that very hour. And now, surrounded, like the saint-like\r\npersonages of olden times, with a radiant halo, that glorified him\r\namid this gloomy night of sin,—as if the departed Governor had left\r\nhim an inheritance of his glory, or as if he had caught upon himself\r\nthe distant shine of the celestial city, while looking thitherward to\r\nsee the triumphant pilgrim pass within its gates,—now, in short, good\r\nFather Wilson was moving homeward, aiding his footsteps with a lighted\r\nlantern! The glimmer of this luminary suggested the above conceits to\r\nMr. Dimmesdale, who smiled,—nay, almost laughed at them,—and then\r\nwondered if he were going mad.\r\n\r\nAs the Reverend Mr. Wilson passed beside the scaffold, closely\r\nmuffling his Geneva cloak about him with one arm, and holding the\r\nlantern before his breast with the other, the minister could hardly\r\nrestrain himself from speaking.\r\n\r\n“A good evening to you, venerable Father Wilson! Come up hither, I\r\npray you, and pass a pleasant hour with me!”\r\n\r\nGood heavens! Had Mr. Dimmesdale actually spoken? For one instant, he\r\nbelieved that these words had passed his lips. But they were uttered\r\nonly within his imagination. The venerable Father Wilson continued to\r\nstep slowly onward, looking carefully at the muddy pathway before his\r\nfeet, and never once turning his head towards the guilty platform.\r\nWhen the light of the glimmering lantern had faded quite away, the\r\nminister discovered, by the faintness which came over him, that the\r\nlast few moments had been a crisis of terrible anxiety; although his\r\nmind had made an involuntary effort to relieve itself by a kind of\r\nlurid playfulness.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards, the like grisly sense of the humorous again stole\r\nin among the solemn phantoms of his thought. He felt his limbs growing\r\nstiff with the unaccustomed chilliness of the night, and doubted\r\nwhether he should be able to descend the steps of the scaffold.\r\nMorning would break, and find him there. The neighborhood would begin\r\nto rouse itself. The earliest riser, coming forth in the dim\r\ntwilight, would perceive a vaguely defined figure aloft on the place\r\nof shame; and, half crazed betwixt alarm and curiosity, would go,\r\nknocking from door to door, summoning all the people to behold the\r\nghost—as he needs must think it—of some defunct transgressor. A\r\ndusky tumult would flap its wings from one house to another. Then—the\r\nmorning light still waxing stronger—old patriarchs would rise up in\r\ngreat haste, each in his flannel gown, and matronly dames, without\r\npausing to put off their night-gear. The whole tribe of decorous\r\npersonages, who had never heretofore been seen with a single hair of\r\ntheir heads awry, would start into public view, with the disorder of a\r\nnightmare in their aspects. Old Governor Bellingham would come grimly\r\nforth, with his King James’s ruff fastened askew; and Mistress\r\nHibbins, with some twigs of the forest clinging to her skirts, and\r\nlooking sourer than ever, as having hardly got a wink of sleep after\r\nher night ride; and good Father Wilson, too, after spending half the\r\nnight at a death-bed, and liking ill to be disturbed, thus early, out\r\nof his dreams about the glorified saints. Hither, likewise, would come\r\nthe elders and deacons of Mr. Dimmesdale’s church, and the young\r\nvirgins who so idolized their minister, and had made a shrine for him\r\nin their white bosoms; which now, by the by, in their hurry and\r\nconfusion, they would scantly have given themselves time to cover with\r\ntheir kerchiefs. All people, in a word, would come stumbling over\r\ntheir thresholds, and turning up their amazed and horror-stricken\r\nvisages around the scaffold. Whom would they discern there, with the\r\nred eastern light upon his brow? Whom, but the Reverend Arthur\r\nDimmesdale, half frozen to death, overwhelmed with shame, and standing\r\nwhere Hester Prynne had stood!\r\n\r\nCarried away by the grotesque horror of this picture, the minister,\r\nunawares, and to his own infinite alarm, burst into a great peal of\r\nlaughter. It was immediately responded to by a light, airy, childish\r\nlaugh, in which, with a thrill of the heart,—but he knew not whether\r\nof exquisite pain, or pleasure as acute,—he recognized the tones of\r\nlittle Pearl.\r\n\r\n“Pearl! Little Pearl!” cried he after a moment’s pause; then,\r\nsuppressing his voice,—“Hester! Hester Prynne! Are you there?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; it is Hester Prynne!” she replied, in a tone of surprise; and\r\nthe minister heard her footsteps approaching from the sidewalk, along\r\nwhich she had been passing. “It is I, and my little Pearl.”\r\n\r\n“Whence come you, Hester?” asked the minister. “What sent you hither?”\r\n\r\n“I have been watching at a death-bed,” answered Hester Prynne;—“at\r\nGovernor Winthrop’s death-bed, and have taken his measure for a robe,\r\nand am now going homeward to my dwelling.”\r\n\r\n“Come up hither, Hester, thou and little Pearl,” said the Reverend Mr.\r\nDimmesdale. “Ye have both been here before, but I was not with you.\r\nCome up hither once again, and we will stand all three together!”\r\n\r\nShe silently ascended the steps, and stood on the platform, holding\r\nlittle Pearl by the hand. The minister felt for the child’s other\r\nhand, and took it. The moment that he did so, there came what seemed a\r\ntumultuous rush of new life, other life than his own, pouring like a\r\ntorrent into his heart, and hurrying through all his veins, as if the\r\nmother and the child were communicating their vital warmth to his\r\nhalf-torpid system. The three formed an electric chain.\r\n\r\n“Minister!” whispered little Pearl.\r\n\r\n“What wouldst thou say, child?” asked Mr. Dimmesdale.\r\n\r\n“Wilt thou stand here with mother and me, to-morrow noontide?”\r\ninquired Pearl.\r\n\r\n“Nay; not so, my little Pearl,” answered the minister; for, with the\r\nnew energy of the moment, all the dread of public exposure, that had\r\nso long been the anguish of his life, had returned upon him; and he\r\nwas already trembling at the conjunction in which—with a strange joy,\r\nnevertheless—he now found himself. “Not so, my child. I shall,\r\nindeed, stand with thy mother and thee one other day, but not\r\nto-morrow.”\r\n\r\nPearl laughed, and attempted to pull away her hand. But the minister\r\nheld it fast.\r\n\r\n“A moment longer, my child!” said he.\r\n\r\n“But wilt thou promise,” asked Pearl, “to take my hand, and mother’s\r\nhand, to-morrow noontide?”\r\n\r\n“Not then, Pearl,” said the minister, “but another time.”\r\n\r\n“And what other time?” persisted the child.\r\n\r\n“At the great judgment day,” whispered the minister,—and, strangely\r\nenough, the sense that he was a professional teacher of the truth\r\nimpelled him to answer the child so. “Then, and there, before the\r\njudgment-seat, thy mother, and thou, and I must stand together. But\r\nthe daylight of this world shall not see our meeting!”\r\n\r\nPearl laughed again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “They stood in the noon of that strange splendor”]\r\n\r\nBut, before Mr. Dimmesdale had done speaking, a light gleamed far and\r\nwide over all the muffled sky. It was doubtless caused by one of those\r\nmeteors, which the night-watcher may so often observe burning out to\r\nwaste, in the vacant regions of the atmosphere. So powerful was its\r\nradiance, that it thoroughly illuminated the dense medium of cloud\r\nbetwixt the sky and earth. The great vault brightened, like the dome\r\nof an immense lamp. It showed the familiar scene of the street, with\r\nthe distinctness of mid-day, but also with the awfulness that is\r\nalways imparted to familiar objects by an unaccustomed light. The\r\nwooden houses, with their jutting stories and quaint gable-peaks; the\r\ndoorsteps and thresholds, with the early grass springing up about\r\nthem; the garden-plots, black with freshly turned earth; the\r\nwheel-track, little worn, and, even in the market-place, margined with\r\ngreen on either side;—all were visible, but with a singularity of\r\naspect that seemed to give another moral interpretation to the things\r\nof this world than they had ever borne before. And there stood the\r\nminister, with his hand over his heart; and Hester Prynne, with the\r\nembroidered letter glimmering on her bosom; and little Pearl, herself\r\na symbol, and the connecting link between those two. They stood in the\r\nnoon of that strange and solemn splendor, as if it were the light that\r\nis to reveal all secrets, and the daybreak that shall unite all who\r\nbelong to one another.\r\n\r\nThere was witchcraft in little Pearl’s eyes, and her face, as she\r\nglanced upward at the minister, wore that naughty smile which made its\r\nexpression frequently so elvish. She withdrew her hand from Mr.\r\nDimmesdale’s, and pointed across the street. But he clasped both his\r\nhands over his breast, and cast his eyes towards the zenith.\r\n\r\nNothing was more common, in those days, than to interpret all meteoric\r\nappearances, and other natural phenomena, that occurred with less\r\nregularity than the rise and set of sun and moon, as so many\r\nrevelations from a supernatural source. Thus, a blazing spear, a sword\r\nof flame, a bow, or a sheaf of arrows, seen in the midnight sky,\r\nprefigured Indian warfare. Pestilence was known to have been foreboded\r\nby a shower of crimson light. We doubt whether any marked event, for\r\ngood or evil, ever befell New England, from its settlement down to\r\nRevolutionary times, of which the inhabitants had not been previously\r\nwarned by some spectacle of this nature. Not seldom, it had been seen\r\nby multitudes. Oftener, however, its credibility rested on the faith\r\nof some lonely eye-witness, who beheld the wonder through the colored,\r\nmagnifying, and distorting medium of his imagination, and shaped it\r\nmore distinctly in his after-thought. It was, indeed, a majestic idea,\r\nthat the destiny of nations should be revealed, in these awful\r\nhieroglyphics, on the cope of heaven. A scroll so wide might not be\r\ndeemed too expansive for Providence to write a people’s doom upon. The\r\nbelief was a favorite one with our forefathers, as betokening that\r\ntheir infant commonwealth was under a celestial guardianship of\r\npeculiar intimacy and strictness. But what shall we say, when an\r\nindividual discovers a revelation addressed to himself alone, on the\r\nsame vast sheet of record! In such a case, it could only be the\r\nsymptom of a highly disordered mental state, when a man, rendered\r\nmorbidly self-contemplative by long, intense, and secret pain, had\r\nextended his egotism over the whole expanse of nature, until the\r\nfirmament itself should appear no more than a fitting page for his\r\nsoul’s history and fate!\r\n\r\nWe impute it, therefore, solely to the disease in his own eye and\r\nheart, that the minister, looking upward to the zenith, beheld there\r\nthe appearance of an immense letter,—the letter A,—marked out in\r\nlines of dull red light. Not but the meteor may have shown itself at\r\nthat point, burning duskily through a veil of cloud; but with no such\r\nshape as his guilty imagination gave it; or, at least, with so little\r\ndefiniteness, that another’s guilt might have seen another symbol in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThere was a singular circumstance that characterized Mr. Dimmesdale’s\r\npsychological state, at this moment. All the time that he gazed upward\r\nto the zenith, he was, nevertheless, perfectly aware that little Pearl\r\nwas pointing her finger towards old Roger Chillingworth, who stood at\r\nno great distance from the scaffold. The minister appeared to see him,\r\nwith the same glance that discerned the miraculous letter. To his\r\nfeatures, as to all other objects, the meteoric light imparted a new\r\nexpression; or it might well be that the physician was not careful\r\nthen, as at all other times, to hide the malevolence with which he\r\nlooked upon his victim. Certainly, if the meteor kindled up the sky,\r\nand disclosed the earth, with an awfulness that admonished Hester\r\nPrynne and the clergyman of the day of judgment, then might Roger\r\nChillingworth have passed with them for the arch-fiend, standing there\r\nwith a smile and scowl, to claim his own. So vivid was the expression,\r\nor so intense the minister’s perception of it, that it seemed still to\r\nremain painted on the darkness, after the meteor had vanished, with an\r\neffect as if the street and all things else were at once annihilated.\r\n\r\n“Who is that man, Hester?” gasped Mr. Dimmesdale, overcome with\r\nterror. “I shiver at him! Dost thou know the man? I hate him, Hester!”\r\n\r\nShe remembered her oath, and was silent.\r\n\r\n“I tell thee, my soul shivers at him!” muttered the minister again.\r\n“Who is he? Who is he? Canst thou do nothing for me? I have a nameless\r\nhorror of the man!”\r\n\r\n“Minister,” said little Pearl, “I can tell thee who he is!”\r\n\r\n“Quickly, then, child!” said the minister, bending his ear close to\r\nher lips. “Quickly!—and as low as thou canst whisper.”\r\n\r\nPearl mumbled something into his ear, that sounded, indeed, like human\r\nlanguage, but was only such gibberish as children may be heard amusing\r\nthemselves with, by the hour together. At all events, if it involved\r\nany secret information in regard to old Roger Chillingworth, it was in\r\na tongue unknown to the erudite clergyman, and did but increase the\r\nbewilderment of his mind. The elvish child then laughed aloud.\r\n\r\n“Dost thou mock me now?” said the minister.\r\n\r\n“Thou wast not bold!—thou wast not true!”—answered the child. “Thou\r\nwouldst not promise to take my hand, and mother’s hand, to-morrow\r\nnoontide!”\r\n\r\n“Worthy Sir,” answered the physician, who had now advanced to the foot\r\nof the platform. “Pious Master Dimmesdale, can this be you? Well,\r\nwell, indeed! We men of study, whose heads are in our books, have need\r\nto be straitly looked after! We dream in our waking moments, and walk\r\nin our sleep. Come, good Sir, and my dear friend, I pray you, let me\r\nlead you home!”\r\n\r\n“How knewest thou that I was here?” asked the minister, fearfully.\r\n\r\n“Verily, and in good faith,” answered Roger Chillingworth, “I knew\r\nnothing of the matter. I had spent the better part of the night at the\r\nbedside of the worshipful Governor Winthrop, doing what my poor skill\r\nmight to give him ease. He going home to a better world, I, likewise,\r\nwas on my way homeward, when this strange light shone out. Come with\r\nme, I beseech you, Reverend Sir; else you will be poorly able to do\r\nSabbath duty to-morrow. Aha! see now, how they trouble the\r\nbrain,—these books!—these books! You should study less, good Sir,\r\nand take a little pastime; or these night-whimseys will grow upon\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“I will go home with you,” said Mr. Dimmesdale.\r\n\r\nWith a chill despondency, like one awaking, all nerveless, from an\r\nugly dream, he yielded himself to the physician, and was led away.\r\n\r\nThe next day, however, being the Sabbath, he preached a discourse\r\nwhich was held to be the richest and most powerful, and the most\r\nreplete with heavenly influences, that had ever proceeded from his\r\nlips. Souls, it is said more souls than one, were brought to the truth\r\nby the efficacy of that sermon, and vowed within themselves to cherish\r\na holy gratitude towards Mr. Dimmesdale throughout the long hereafter.\r\nBut, as he came down the pulpit steps, the gray-bearded sexton met\r\nhim, holding up a black glove, which the minister recognized as his\r\nown.\r\n\r\n“It was found,” said the sexton, “this morning, on the scaffold where\r\nevil-doers are set up to public shame. Satan dropped it there, I take\r\nit, intending a scurrilous jest against your reverence. But, indeed,\r\nhe was blind and foolish, as he ever and always is. A pure hand needs\r\nno glove to cover it!”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, my good friend,” said the minister, gravely, but startled\r\nat heart; for, so confused was his remembrance, that he had almost\r\nbrought himself to look at the events of the past night as visionary.\r\n“Yes, it seems to be my glove, indeed!”\r\n\r\n“And since Satan saw fit to steal it, your reverence must needs handle\r\nhim without gloves, henceforward,” remarked the old sexton, grimly\r\nsmiling. “But did your reverence hear of the portent that was seen\r\nlast night?—a great red letter in the sky,—the letter A, which we\r\ninterpret to stand for Angel. For, as our good Governor Winthrop was\r\nmade an angel this past night, it was doubtless held fit that there\r\nshould be some notice thereof!”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered the minister, “I had not heard of it.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\n [Illustration]"

      "content": "ANOTHER VIEW OF HESTER.\r\n\nIn her late singular interview with Mr. Dimmesdale, Hester Prynne was\r\nshocked at the condition to which she found the clergyman reduced. His\r\nnerve seemed absolutely destroyed. His moral force was abased into\r\nmore than childish weakness. It grovelled helpless on the ground, even\r\nwhile his intellectual faculties retained their pristine strength, or\r\nhad perhaps acquired a morbid energy, which disease only could have\r\ngiven them. With her knowledge of a train of circumstances hidden from\r\nall others, she could readily infer that, besides the legitimate\r\naction of his own conscience, a terrible machinery had been brought to\r\nbear, and was still operating, on Mr. Dimmesdale’s well-being and\r\nrepose. Knowing what this poor, fallen man had once been, her whole\r\nsoul was moved by the shuddering terror with which he had appealed to\r\nher,—the outcast woman,—for support against his instinctively\r\ndiscovered enemy. She decided, moreover, that he had a right to her\r\nutmost aid. Little accustomed, in her long seclusion from society, to\r\nmeasure her ideas of right and wrong by any standard external to\r\nherself, Hester saw—or seemed to see—that there lay a responsibility\r\nupon her, in reference to the clergyman, which she owed to no other,\r\nnor to the whole world besides. The links that united her to the rest\r\nof human kind—links of flowers, or silk, or gold, or whatever the\r\nmaterial—had all been broken. Here was the iron link of mutual crime,\r\nwhich neither he nor she could break. Like all other ties, it brought\r\nalong with it its obligations.\r\n\r\nHester Prynne did not now occupy precisely the same position in which\r\nwe beheld her during the earlier periods of her ignominy. Years had\r\ncome and gone. Pearl was now seven years old. Her mother, with the\r\nscarlet letter on her breast, glittering in its fantastic embroidery,\r\nhad long been a familiar object to the towns-people. As is apt to be\r\nthe case when a person stands out in any prominence before the\r\ncommunity, and, at the same time, interferes neither with public nor\r\nindividual interests and convenience, a species of general regard had\r\nultimately grown up in reference to Hester Prynne. It is to the credit\r\nof human nature, that, except where its selfishness is brought into\r\nplay, it loves more readily than it hates. Hatred, by a gradual and\r\nquiet process, will even be transformed to love, unless the change be\r\nimpeded by a continually new irritation of the original feeling of\r\nhostility. In this matter of Hester Prynne, there was neither\r\nirritation nor irksomeness. She never battled with the public, but\r\nsubmitted, uncomplainingly, to its worst usage; she made no claim upon\r\nit, in requital for what she suffered; she did not weigh upon its\r\nsympathies. Then, also, the blameless purity of her life during all\r\nthese years in which she had been set apart to infamy, was reckoned\r\nlargely in her favor. With nothing now to lose, in the sight of\r\nmankind, and with no hope, and seemingly no wish, of gaining anything,\r\nit could only be a genuine regard for virtue that had brought back the\r\npoor wanderer to its paths.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hester in the House of Mourning]\r\n\r\nIt was perceived, too, that while Hester never put forward even the\r\nhumblest title to share in the world’s privileges,—further than to\r\nbreathe the common air, and earn daily bread for little Pearl and\r\nherself by the faithful labor of her hands,—she was quick to\r\nacknowledge her sisterhood with the race of man, whenever benefits\r\nwere to be conferred. None so ready as she to give of her little\r\nsubstance to every demand of poverty; even though the bitter-hearted\r\npauper threw back a gibe in requital of the food brought regularly to\r\nhis door, or the garments wrought for him by the fingers that could\r\nhave embroidered a monarch’s robe. None so self-devoted as Hester,\r\nwhen pestilence stalked through the town. In all seasons of calamity,\r\nindeed, whether general or of individuals, the outcast of society at\r\nonce found her place. She came, not as a guest, but as a rightful\r\ninmate, into the household that was darkened by trouble; as if its\r\ngloomy twilight were a medium in which she was entitled to hold\r\nintercourse with her fellow-creatures. There glimmered the embroidered\r\nletter, with comfort in its unearthly ray. Elsewhere the token of sin,\r\nit was the taper of the sick-chamber. It had even thrown its gleam, in\r\nthe sufferer’s hard extremity, across the verge of time. It had shown\r\nhim where to set his foot, while the light of earth was fast becoming\r\ndim, and ere the light of futurity could reach him. In such\r\nemergencies, Hester’s nature showed itself warm and rich; a\r\nwell-spring of human tenderness, unfailing to every real demand, and\r\ninexhaustible by the largest. Her breast, with its badge of shame, was\r\nbut the softer pillow for the head that needed one. She was\r\nself-ordained a Sister of Mercy; or, we may rather say, the world’s\r\nheavy hand had so ordained her, when neither the world nor she looked\r\nforward to this result. The letter was the symbol of her calling. Such\r\nhelpfulness was found in her,—so much power to do, and power to\r\nsympathize,—that many people refused to interpret the scarlet A by\r\nits original signification. They said that it meant Able; so strong\r\nwas Hester Prynne, with a woman’s strength.\r\n\r\nIt was only the darkened house that could contain her. When sunshine\r\ncame again, she was not there. Her shadow had faded across the\r\nthreshold. The helpful inmate had departed, without one backward\r\nglance to gather up the meed of gratitude, if any were in the hearts\r\nof those whom she had served so zealously. Meeting them in the\r\nstreet, she never raised her head to receive their greeting. If they\r\nwere resolute to accost her, she laid her finger on the scarlet\r\nletter, and passed on. This might be pride, but was so like humility,\r\nthat it produced all the softening influence of the latter quality on\r\nthe public mind. The public is despotic in its temper; it is capable\r\nof denying common justice, when too strenuously demanded as a right;\r\nbut quite as frequently it awards more than justice, when the appeal\r\nis made, as despots love to have it made, entirely to its generosity.\r\nInterpreting Hester Prynne’s deportment as an appeal of this nature,\r\nsociety was inclined to show its former victim a more benign\r\ncountenance than she cared to be favored with, or, perchance, than she\r\ndeserved.\r\n\r\nThe rulers, and the wise and learned men of the community, were longer\r\nin acknowledging the influence of Hester’s good qualities than the\r\npeople. The prejudices which they shared in common with the latter\r\nwere fortified in themselves by an iron framework of reasoning, that\r\nmade it a far tougher labor to expel them. Day by day, nevertheless,\r\ntheir sour and rigid wrinkles were relaxing into something which, in\r\nthe due course of years, might grow to be an expression of almost\r\nbenevolence. Thus it was with the men of rank, on whom their eminent\r\nposition imposed the guardianship of the public morals. Individuals in\r\nprivate life, meanwhile, had quite forgiven Hester Prynne for her\r\nfrailty; nay, more, they had begun to look upon the scarlet letter as\r\nthe token, not of that one sin, for which she had borne so long and\r\ndreary a penance, but of her many good deeds since. “Do you see that\r\nwoman with the embroidered badge?” they would say to strangers. “It is\r\nour Hester,—the town’s own Hester, who is so kind to the poor, so\r\nhelpful to the sick, so comfortable to the afflicted!” Then, it is\r\ntrue, the propensity of human nature to tell the very worst of itself,\r\nwhen embodied in the person of another, would constrain them to\r\nwhisper the black scandal of bygone years. It was none the less a\r\nfact, however, that, in the eyes of the very men who spoke thus, the\r\nscarlet letter had the effect of the cross on a nun’s bosom. It\r\nimparted to the wearer a kind of sacredness, which enabled her to walk\r\nsecurely amid all peril. Had she fallen among thieves, it would have\r\nkept her safe. It was reported, and believed by many, that an Indian\r\nhad drawn his arrow against the badge, and that the missile struck it,\r\nbut fell harmless to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the symbol—or, rather, of the position in respect to\r\nsociety that was indicated by it—on the mind of Hester Prynne\r\nherself, was powerful and peculiar. All the light and graceful foliage\r\nof her character had been withered up by this red-hot brand, and had\r\nlong ago fallen away, leaving a bare and harsh outline, which might\r\nhave been repulsive, had she possessed friends or companions to be\r\nrepelled by it. Even the attractiveness of her person had undergone a\r\nsimilar change. It might be partly owing to the studied austerity of\r\nher dress, and partly to the lack of demonstration in her manners. It\r\nwas a sad transformation, too, that her rich and luxuriant hair had\r\neither been cut off, or was so completely hidden by a cap, that not a\r\nshining lock of it ever once gushed into the sunshine. It was due in\r\npart to all these causes, but still more to something else, that there\r\nseemed to be no longer anything in Hester’s face for Love to dwell\r\nupon; nothing in Hester’s form, though majestic and statue-like, that\r\nPassion would ever dream of clasping in its embrace; nothing in\r\nHester’s bosom, to make it ever again the pillow of Affection. Some\r\nattribute had departed from her, the permanence of which had been\r\nessential to keep her a woman. Such is frequently the fate, and such\r\nthe stern development, of the feminine character and person, when the\r\nwoman has encountered, and lived through, an experience of peculiar\r\nseverity. If she be all tenderness, she will die. If she survive, the\r\ntenderness will either be crushed out of her, or—and the outward\r\nsemblance is the same—crushed so deeply into her heart that it can\r\nnever show itself more. The latter is perhaps the truest theory. She\r\nwho has once been woman, and ceased to be so, might at any moment\r\nbecome a woman again if there were only the magic touch to effect the\r\ntransfiguration. We shall see whether Hester Prynne were ever\r\nafterwards so touched, and so transfigured.\r\n\r\nMuch of the marble coldness of Hester’s impression was to be\r\nattributed to the circumstance, that her life had turned, in a great\r\nmeasure, from passion and feeling, to thought. Standing alone in the\r\nworld,—alone, as to any dependence on society, and with little Pearl\r\nto be guided and protected,—alone, and hopeless of retrieving her\r\nposition, even had she not scorned to consider it desirable,—she cast\r\naway the fragments of a broken chain. The world’s law was no law for\r\nher mind. It was an age in which the human intellect, newly\r\nemancipated, had taken a more active and a wider range than for many\r\ncenturies before. Men of the sword had overthrown nobles and kings.\r\nMen bolder than these had overthrown and rearranged—not actually, but\r\nwithin the sphere of theory, which was their most real abode—the\r\nwhole system of ancient prejudice, wherewith was linked much of\r\nancient principle. Hester Prynne imbibed this spirit. She assumed a\r\nfreedom of speculation, then common enough on the other side of the\r\nAtlantic, but which our forefathers, had they known it, would have\r\nheld to be a deadlier crime than that stigmatized by the scarlet\r\nletter. In her lonesome cottage, by the sea-shore, thoughts visited\r\nher, such as dared to enter no other dwelling in New England; shadowy\r\nguests, that would have been as perilous as demons to their\r\nentertainer, could they have been seen so much as knocking at her\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable, that persons who speculate the most boldly often\r\nconform with the most perfect quietude to the external regulations of\r\nsociety. The thought suffices them, without investing itself in the\r\nflesh and blood of action. So it seemed to be with Hester. Yet, had\r\nlittle Pearl never come to her from the spiritual world, it might have\r\nbeen far otherwise. Then, she might have come down to us in history,\r\nhand in hand with Ann Hutchinson, as the foundress of a religious\r\nsect. She might, in one of her phases, have been a prophetess. She\r\nmight, and not improbably would, have suffered death from the stern\r\ntribunals of the period, for attempting to undermine the foundations\r\nof the Puritan establishment. But, in the education of her child, the\r\nmother’s enthusiasm of thought had something to wreak itself upon.\r\nProvidence, in the person of this little girl, had assigned to\r\nHester’s charge the germ and blossom of womanhood, to be cherished and\r\ndeveloped amid a host of difficulties. Everything was against her. The\r\nworld was hostile. The child’s own nature had something wrong in it,\r\nwhich continually betokened that she had been born amiss,—the\r\neffluence of her mother’s lawless passion,—and often impelled Hester\r\nto ask, in bitterness of heart, whether it were for ill or good that\r\nthe poor little creature had been born at all.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the same dark question often rose into her mind, with\r\nreference to the whole race of womanhood. Was existence worth\r\naccepting, even to the happiest among them? As concerned her own\r\nindividual existence, she had long ago decided in the negative, and\r\ndismissed the point as settled. A tendency to speculation, though it\r\nmay keep woman quiet, as it does man, yet makes her sad. She discerns,\r\nit may be, such a hopeless task before her. As a first step, the whole\r\nsystem of society is to be torn down, and built up anew. Then, the\r\nvery nature of the opposite sex, or its long hereditary habit, which\r\nhas become like nature, is to be essentially modified, before woman\r\ncan be allowed to assume what seems a fair and suitable position.\r\nFinally, all other difficulties being obviated, woman cannot take\r\nadvantage of these preliminary reforms, until she herself shall have\r\nundergone a still mightier change; in which, perhaps, the ethereal\r\nessence, wherein she has her truest life, will be found to have\r\nevaporated. A woman never overcomes these problems by any exercise of\r\nthought. They are not to be solved, or only in one way. If her heart\r\nchance to come uppermost, they vanish. Thus, Hester Prynne, whose\r\nheart had lost its regular and healthy throb, wandered without a clew\r\nin the dark labyrinth of mind; now turned aside by an insurmountable\r\nprecipice; now starting back from a deep chasm. There was wild and\r\nghastly scenery all around her, and a home and comfort nowhere. At\r\ntimes, a fearful doubt strove to possess her soul, whether it were not\r\nbetter to send Pearl at once to heaven, and go herself to such\r\nfuturity as Eternal Justice should provide.\r\n\r\nThe scarlet letter had not done its office.\r\n\r\nNow, however, her interview with the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, on the\r\nnight of his vigil, had given her a new theme of reflection, and held\r\nup to her an object that appeared worthy of any exertion and sacrifice\r\nfor its attainment. She had witnessed the intense misery beneath\r\nwhich the minister struggled, or, to speak more accurately, had ceased\r\nto struggle. She saw that he stood on the verge of lunacy, if he had\r\nnot already stepped across it. It was impossible to doubt, that,\r\nwhatever painful efficacy there might be in the secret sting of\r\nremorse, a deadlier venom had been infused into it by the hand that\r\nproffered relief. A secret enemy had been continually by his side,\r\nunder the semblance of a friend and helper, and had availed himself of\r\nthe opportunities thus afforded for tampering with the delicate\r\nsprings of Mr. Dimmesdale’s nature. Hester could not but ask herself,\r\nwhether there had not originally been a defect of truth, courage, and\r\nloyalty, on her own part, in allowing the minister to be thrown into a\r\nposition where so much evil was to be foreboded, and nothing\r\nauspicious to be hoped. Her only justification lay in the fact, that\r\nshe had been able to discern no method of rescuing him from a blacker\r\nruin than had overwhelmed herself, except by acquiescing in Roger\r\nChillingworth’s scheme of disguise. Under that impulse, she had made\r\nher choice, and had chosen, as it now appeared, the more wretched\r\nalternative of the two. She determined to redeem her error, so far as\r\nit might yet be possible. Strengthened by years of hard and solemn\r\ntrial, she felt herself no longer so inadequate to cope with Roger\r\nChillingworth as on that night, abased by sin, and half maddened by\r\nthe ignominy that was still new, when they had talked together in the\r\nprison-chamber. She had climbed her way, since then, to a higher\r\npoint. The old man, on the other hand, had brought himself nearer to\r\nher level, or perhaps below it, by the revenge which he had stooped\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nIn fine, Hester Prynne resolved to meet her former husband, and do\r\nwhat might be in her power for the rescue of the victim on whom he\r\nhad so evidently set his gripe. The occasion was not long to seek. One\r\nafternoon, walking with Pearl in a retired part of the peninsula, she\r\nbeheld the old physician, with a basket on one arm, and a staff in the\r\nother hand, stooping along the ground, in quest of roots and herbs to\r\nconcoct his medicines withal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\n [Illustration]"

      "content": "HESTER AND THE PHYSICIAN.\r\n\nHester bade little Pearl run down to the margin of the water, and play\r\nwith the shells and tangled sea-weed, until she should have talked\r\nawhile with yonder gatherer of herbs. So the child flew away like a\r\nbird, and, making bare her small white feet, went pattering along the\r\nmoist margin of the sea. Here and there she came to a full stop, and\r\npeeped curiously into a pool, left by the retiring tide as a mirror\r\nfor Pearl to see her face in. Forth peeped at her, out of the pool,\r\nwith dark, glistening curls around her head, and an elf-smile in her\r\neyes, the image of a little maid, whom Pearl, having no other\r\nplaymate, invited to take her hand, and run a race with her. But the\r\nvisionary little maid, on her part, beckoned likewise, as if to\r\nsay,—“This is a better place! Come thou into the pool!” And Pearl,\r\nstepping in, mid-leg deep, beheld her own white feet at the bottom;\r\nwhile, out of a still lower depth, came the gleam of a kind of\r\nfragmentary smile, floating to and fro in the agitated water.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, her mother had accosted the physician.\r\n\r\n“I would speak a word with you,” said she,—“a word that concerns us\r\nmuch.”\r\n\r\n“Aha! and is it Mistress Hester that has a word for old Roger\r\nChillingworth?” answered he, raising himself from his stooping\r\nposture. “With all my heart! Why, Mistress, I hear good tidings of you\r\non all hands! No longer ago than yester-eve, a magistrate, a wise and\r\ngodly man, was discoursing of your affairs, Mistress Hester, and\r\nwhispered me that there had been question concerning you in the\r\ncouncil. It was debated whether or no, with safety to the common weal,\r\nyonder scarlet letter might be taken off your bosom. On my life,\r\nHester, I made my entreaty to the worshipful magistrate that it might\r\nbe done forthwith!”\r\n\r\n“It lies not in the pleasure of the magistrates to take off this\r\nbadge,” calmly replied Hester. “Were I worthy to be quit of it, it\r\nwould fall away of its own nature, or be transformed into something\r\nthat should speak a different purport.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, then, wear it, if it suit you better,” rejoined he. “A woman\r\nmust needs follow her own fancy, touching the adornment of her person.\r\nThe letter is gayly embroidered, and shows right bravely on your\r\nbosom!”\r\n\r\nAll this while, Hester had been looking steadily at the old man, and\r\nwas shocked, as well as wonder-smitten, to discern what a change had\r\nbeen wrought upon him within the past seven years. It was not so much\r\nthat he had grown older; for though the traces of advancing life were\r\nvisible, he bore his age well, and seemed to retain a wiry vigor and\r\nalertness. But the former aspect of an intellectual and studious man,\r\ncalm and quiet, which was what she best remembered in him, had\r\naltogether vanished, and been succeeded by an eager, searching,\r\nalmost fierce, yet carefully guarded look. It seemed to be his wish\r\nand purpose to mask this expression with a smile; but the latter\r\nplayed him false, and flickered over his visage so derisively, that\r\nthe spectator could see his blackness all the better for it. Ever and\r\nanon, too, there came a glare of red light out of his eyes; as if the\r\nold man’s soul were on fire, and kept on smouldering duskily within\r\nhis breast, until, by some casual puff of passion, it was blown into a\r\nmomentary flame. This he repressed, as speedily as possible, and\r\nstrove to look as if nothing of the kind had happened.\r\n\r\nIn a word, old Roger Chillingworth was a striking evidence of man’s\r\nfaculty of transforming himself into a devil, if he will only, for a\r\nreasonable space of time, undertake a devil’s office. This unhappy\r\nperson had effected such a transformation, by devoting himself, for\r\nseven years, to the constant analysis of a heart full of torture, and\r\nderiving his enjoyment thence, and adding fuel to those fiery tortures\r\nwhich he analyzed and gloated over.\r\n\r\nThe scarlet letter burned on Hester Prynne’s bosom. Here was another\r\nruin, the responsibility of which came partly home to her.\r\n\r\n“What see you in my face,” asked the physician, “that you look at it\r\nso earnestly?”\r\n\r\n“Something that would make me weep, if there were any tears bitter\r\nenough for it,” answered she. “But let it pass! It is of yonder\r\nmiserable man that I would speak.”\r\n\r\n“And what of him?” cried Roger Chillingworth, eagerly, as if he loved\r\nthe topic, and were glad of an opportunity to discuss it with the only\r\nperson of whom he could make a confidant. “Not to hide the truth,\r\nMistress Hester, my thoughts happen just now to be busy with the\r\ngentleman. So speak freely; and I will make answer.”\r\n\r\n“When we last spake together,” said Hester, “now seven years ago, it\r\nwas your pleasure to extort a promise of secrecy, as touching the\r\nformer relation betwixt yourself and me. As the life and good fame of\r\nyonder man were in your hands, there seemed no choice to me, save to\r\nbe silent, in accordance with your behest. Yet it was not without\r\nheavy misgivings that I thus bound myself; for, having cast off all\r\nduty towards other human beings, there remained a duty towards him;\r\nand something whispered me that I was betraying it, in pledging myself\r\nto keep your counsel. Since that day, no man is so near to him as you.\r\nYou tread behind his every footstep. You are beside him, sleeping and\r\nwaking. You search his thoughts. You burrow and rankle in his heart!\r\nYour clutch is on his life, and you cause him to die daily a living\r\ndeath; and still he knows you not. In permitting this, I have surely\r\nacted a false part by the only man to whom the power was left me to be\r\ntrue!”\r\n\r\n“What choice had you?” asked Roger Chillingworth. “My finger, pointed\r\nat this man, would have hurled him from his pulpit into a\r\ndungeon,—thence, peradventure, to the gallows!”\r\n\r\n“It had been better so!” said Hester Prynne.\r\n\r\n“What evil have I done the man?” asked Roger Chillingworth again. “I\r\ntell thee, Hester Prynne, the richest fee that ever physician earned\r\nfrom monarch could not have bought such care as I have wasted on this\r\nmiserable priest! But for my aid, his life would have burned away in\r\ntorments, within the first two years after the perpetration of his\r\ncrime and thine. For, Hester, his spirit lacked the strength that\r\ncould have borne up, as thine has, beneath a burden like thy scarlet\r\nletter. O, I could reveal a goodly secret! But enough! What art can\r\ndo, I have exhausted on him. That he now breathes, and creeps about on\r\nearth, is owing all to me!”\r\n\r\n“Better he had died at once!” said Hester Prynne.\r\n\r\n“Yea, woman, thou sayest truly!” cried old Roger Chillingworth,\r\nletting the lurid fire of his heart blaze out before her eyes. “Better\r\nhad he died at once! Never did mortal suffer what this man has\r\nsuffered. And all, all, in the sight of his worst enemy! He has been\r\nconscious of me. He has felt an influence dwelling always upon him\r\nlike a curse. He knew, by some spiritual sense,—for the Creator never\r\nmade another being so sensitive as this,—he knew that no friendly\r\nhand was pulling at his heart-strings, and that an eye was looking\r\ncuriously into him, which sought only evil, and found it. But he knew\r\nnot that the eye and hand were mine! With the superstition common to\r\nhis brotherhood, he fancied himself given over to a fiend, to be\r\ntortured with frightful dreams, and desperate thoughts, the sting of\r\nremorse, and despair of pardon; as a foretaste of what awaits him\r\nbeyond the grave. But it was the constant shadow of my presence!—the\r\nclosest propinquity of the man whom he had most vilely wronged!—and\r\nwho had grown to exist only by this perpetual poison of the direst\r\nrevenge! Yea, indeed!—he did not err!—there was a fiend at his\r\nelbow! A mortal man, with once a human heart, has become a fiend for\r\nhis especial torment!”\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate physician, while uttering these words, lifted his\r\nhands with a look of horror, as if he had beheld some frightful shape,\r\nwhich he could not recognize, usurping the place of his own image in\r\na glass. It was one of those moments—which sometimes occur only at\r\nthe interval of years—when a man’s moral aspect is faithfully\r\nrevealed to his mind’s eye. Not improbably, he had never before viewed\r\nhimself as he did now.\r\n\r\n“Hast thou not tortured him enough?” said Hester, noticing the old\r\nman’s look. “Has he not paid thee all?”\r\n\r\n“No!—no!—He has but increased the debt!” answered the physician; and\r\nas he proceeded his manner lost its fiercer characteristics, and\r\nsubsided into gloom. “Dost thou remember me, Hester, as I was nine\r\nyears agone? Even then, I was in the autumn of my days, nor was it the\r\nearly autumn. But all my life had been made up of earnest, studious,\r\nthoughtful, quiet years, bestowed faithfully for the increase of mine\r\nown knowledge, and faithfully, too, though this latter object was but\r\ncasual to the other,—faithfully for the advancement of human welfare.\r\nNo life had been more peaceful and innocent than mine; few lives so\r\nrich with benefits conferred. Dost thou remember me? Was I not, though\r\nyou might deem me cold, nevertheless a man thoughtful for others,\r\ncraving little for himself,—kind, true, just, and of constant, if not\r\nwarm affections? Was I not all this?”\r\n\r\n“All this, and more,” said Hester.\r\n\r\n“And what am I now?” demanded he, looking into her face, and\r\npermitting the whole evil within him to be written on his features. “I\r\nhave already told thee what I am! A fiend! Who made me so?”\r\n\r\n“It was myself!” cried Hester, shuddering. “It was I, not less than\r\nhe. Why hast thou not avenged thyself on me?”\r\n\r\n“I have left thee to the scarlet letter,” replied Roger Chillingworth.\r\n“If that have not avenged me, I can do no more!”\r\n\r\nHe laid his finger on it, with a smile.\r\n\r\n“It has avenged thee!” answered Hester Prynne.\r\n\r\n“I judged no less,” said the physician. “And now, what wouldst thou\r\nwith me touching this man?”\r\n\r\n“I must reveal the secret,” answered Hester, firmly. “He must discern\r\nthee in thy true character. What may be the result, I know not. But\r\nthis long debt of confidence, due from me to him, whose bane and ruin\r\nI have been, shall at length be paid. So far as concerns the overthrow\r\nor preservation of his fair fame and his earthly state, and perchance\r\nhis life, he is in thy hands. Nor do I,—whom the scarlet letter has\r\ndisciplined to truth, though it be the truth of red-hot iron, entering\r\ninto the soul,—nor do I perceive such advantage in his living any\r\nlonger a life of ghastly emptiness, that I shall stoop to implore thy\r\nmercy. Do with him as thou wilt! There is no good for him,—no good\r\nfor me,—no good for thee! There is no good for little Pearl! There is\r\nno path to guide us out of this dismal maze!”\r\n\r\n“Woman, I could wellnigh pity thee!” said Roger Chillingworth, unable\r\nto restrain a thrill of admiration too; for there was a quality almost\r\nmajestic in the despair which she expressed. “Thou hadst great\r\nelements. Peradventure, hadst thou met earlier with a better love than\r\nmine, this evil had not been. I pity thee, for the good that has been\r\nwasted in thy nature!”\r\n\r\n“And I thee,” answered Hester Prynne, “for the hatred that has\r\ntransformed a wise and just man to a fiend! Wilt thou yet purge it out\r\nof thee, and be once more human? If not for his sake, then doubly for\r\nthine own! Forgive, and leave his further retribution to the Power\r\nthat claims it! I said, but now, that there could be no good event for\r\nhim, or thee, or me, who are here wandering together in this gloomy\r\nmaze of evil, and stumbling, at every step, over the guilt wherewith\r\nwe have strewn our path. It is not so! There might be good for thee,\r\nand thee alone, since thou hast been deeply wronged, and hast it at\r\nthy will to pardon. Wilt thou give up that only privilege? Wilt thou\r\nreject that priceless benefit?”\r\n\r\n“Peace, Hester, peace!” replied the old man, with gloomy sternness.\r\n“It is not granted me to pardon. I have no such power as thou tellest\r\nme of. My old faith, long forgotten, comes back to me, and explains\r\nall that we do, and all we suffer. By thy first step awry thou didst\r\nplant the germ of evil; but since that moment, it has all been a dark\r\nnecessity. Ye that have wronged me are not sinful, save in a kind of\r\ntypical illusion; neither am I fiend-like, who have snatched a fiend’s\r\noffice from his hands. It is our fate. Let the black flower blossom as\r\nit may! Now go thy ways, and deal as thou wilt with yonder man.”\r\n\r\nHe waved his hand, and betook himself again to his employment of\r\ngathering herbs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mandrake]\r\n\n [Illustration]"

      "content": "HESTER AND PEARL.\r\n\nSo Roger Chillingworth—a deformed old figure, with a face that\r\nhaunted men’s memories longer than they liked—took leave of Hester\r\nPrynne, and went stooping away along the earth. He gathered here and\r\nthere an herb, or grubbed up a root, and put it into the basket on his\r\narm. His gray beard almost touched the ground, as he crept onward.\r\nHester gazed after him a little while, looking with a half-fantastic\r\ncuriosity to see whether the tender grass of early spring would not be\r\nblighted beneath him, and show the wavering track of his footsteps,\r\nsere and brown, across its cheerful verdure. She wondered what sort of\r\nherbs they were, which the old man was so sedulous to gather. Would\r\nnot the earth, quickened to an evil purpose by the sympathy of his\r\neye, greet him with poisonous shrubs, of species hitherto unknown,\r\nthat would start up under his fingers? Or might it suffice him, that\r\nevery wholesome growth should be converted into something deleterious\r\nand malignant at his touch? Did the sun, which shone so brightly\r\neverywhere else, really fall upon him? Or was there, as it rather\r\nseemed, a circle of ominous shadow moving along with his deformity,\r\nwhichever way he turned himself? And whither was he now going? Would\r\nhe not suddenly sink into the earth, leaving a barren and blasted\r\nspot, where, in due course of time, would be seen deadly nightshade,\r\ndogwood, henbane, and whatever else of vegetable wickedness the\r\nclimate could produce, all flourishing with hideous luxuriance? Or\r\nwould he spread bat’s wings and flee away, looking so much the uglier,\r\nthe higher he rose towards heaven?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “He gathered herbs here and there”]\r\n\r\n“Be it sin or no,” said Hester Prynne, bitterly, as she still gazed\r\nafter him, “I hate the man!”\r\n\r\nShe upbraided herself for the sentiment, but could not overcome or\r\nlessen it. Attempting to do so, she thought of those long-past days,\r\nin a distant land, when he used to emerge at eventide from the\r\nseclusion of his study, and sit down in the firelight of their home,\r\nand in the light of her nuptial smile. He needed to bask himself in\r\nthat smile, he said, in order that the chill of so many lonely hours\r\namong his books might be taken off the scholar’s heart. Such scenes\r\nhad once appeared not otherwise than happy, but now, as viewed through\r\nthe dismal medium of her subsequent life, they classed themselves\r\namong her ugliest remembrances. She marvelled how such scenes could\r\nhave been! She marvelled how she could ever have been wrought upon to\r\nmarry him! She deemed it her crime most to be repented of, that she\r\nhad ever endured, and reciprocated, the lukewarm grasp of his hand,\r\nand had suffered the smile of her lips and eyes to mingle and melt\r\ninto his own. And it seemed a fouler offence committed by Roger\r\nChillingworth, than any which had since been done him, that, in the\r\ntime when her heart knew no better, he had persuaded her to fancy\r\nherself happy by his side.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I hate him!” repeated Hester, more bitterly than before. “He\r\nbetrayed me! He has done me worse wrong than I did him!”\r\n\r\nLet men tremble to win the hand of woman, unless they win along with\r\nit the utmost passion of her heart! Else it may be their miserable\r\nfortune, as it was Roger Chillingworth’s, when some mightier touch\r\nthan their own may have awakened all her sensibilities, to be\r\nreproached even for the calm content, the marble image of happiness,\r\nwhich they will have imposed upon her as the warm reality. But Hester\r\nought long ago to have done with this injustice. What did it betoken?\r\nHad seven long years, under the torture of the scarlet letter,\r\ninflicted so much of misery, and wrought out no repentance?\r\n\r\nThe emotions of that brief space, while she stood gazing after the\r\ncrooked figure of old Roger Chillingworth, threw a dark light on\r\nHester’s state of mind, revealing much that she might not otherwise\r\nhave acknowledged to herself.\r\n\r\nHe being gone, she summoned back her child.\r\n\r\n“Pearl! Little Pearl! Where are you?”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pearl on the Sea-Shore]\r\n\r\nPearl, whose activity of spirit never flagged, had been at no loss for\r\namusement while her mother talked with the old gatherer of herbs. At\r\nfirst, as already told, she had flirted fancifully with her own image\r\nin a pool of water, beckoning the phantom forth, and—as it declined\r\nto venture—seeking a passage for herself into its sphere of\r\nimpalpable earth and unattainable sky. Soon finding, however, that\r\neither she or the image was unreal, she turned elsewhere for better\r\npastime. She made little boats out of birch-bark, and freighted them\r\nwith snail-shells, and sent out more ventures on the mighty deep than\r\nany merchant in New England; but the larger part of them foundered\r\nnear the shore. She seized a live horseshoe by the tail, and made\r\nprize of several five-fingers, and laid out a jelly-fish to melt in\r\nthe warm sun. Then she took up the white foam, that streaked the line\r\nof the advancing tide, and threw it upon the breeze, scampering after\r\nit, with winged footsteps, to catch the great snow-flakes ere they\r\nfell. Perceiving a flock of beach-birds, that fed and fluttered along\r\nthe shore, the naughty child picked up her apron full of pebbles, and,\r\ncreeping from rock to rock after these small sea-fowl, displayed\r\nremarkable dexterity in pelting them. One little gray bird, with a\r\nwhite breast, Pearl was almost sure, had been hit by a pebble, and\r\nfluttered away with a broken wing. But then the elf-child sighed, and\r\ngave up her sport; because it grieved her to have done harm to a\r\nlittle being that was as wild as the sea-breeze, or as wild as Pearl\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nHer final employment was to gather sea-weed, of various kinds, and\r\nmake herself a scarf, or mantle, and a head-dress, and thus assume the\r\naspect of a little mermaid. She inherited her mother’s gift for\r\ndevising drapery and costume. As the last touch to her mermaid’s garb,\r\nPearl took some eel-grass, and imitated, as best she could, on her own\r\nbosom, the decoration with which she was so familiar on her mother’s.\r\nA letter,—the letter A,—but freshly green, instead of scarlet! The\r\nchild bent her chin upon her breast, and contemplated this device with\r\nstrange interest; even as if the one only thing for which she had been\r\nsent into the world was to make out its hidden import.\r\n\r\n“I wonder if mother will ask me what it means?” thought Pearl.\r\n\r\nJust then, she heard her mother’s voice, and flitting along as lightly\r\nas one of the little sea-birds, appeared before Hester Prynne,\r\ndancing, laughing, and pointing her finger to the ornament upon her\r\nbosom.\r\n\r\n“My little Pearl,” said Hester, after a moment’s silence, “the green\r\nletter, and on thy childish bosom, has no purport. But dost thou know,\r\nmy child, what this letter means which thy mother is doomed to wear?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, mother,” said the child. “It is the great letter A. Thou hast\r\ntaught me in the horn-book.”\r\n\r\nHester looked steadily into her little face; but, though there was\r\nthat singular expression which she had so often remarked in her black\r\neyes, she could not satisfy herself whether Pearl really attached any\r\nmeaning to the symbol. She felt a morbid desire to ascertain the\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n“Dost thou know, child, wherefore thy mother wears this letter?”\r\n\r\n“Truly do I!” answered Pearl, looking brightly into her mother’s face.\r\n“It is for the same reason that the minister keeps his hand over his\r\nheart!”\r\n\r\n“And what reason is that?” asked Hester, half smiling at the absurd\r\nincongruity of the child’s observation; but, on second thoughts,\r\nturning pale. “What has the letter to do with any heart, save mine?”\r\n\r\n“Nay, mother, I have told all I know,” said Pearl, more seriously than\r\nshe was wont to speak. “Ask yonder old man whom thou hast been talking\r\nwith! It may be he can tell. But in good earnest now, mother dear,\r\nwhat does this scarlet letter mean?—and why dost thou wear it on thy\r\nbosom?—and why does the minister keep his hand over his heart?”\r\n\r\nShe took her mother’s hand in both her own, and gazed into her eyes\r\nwith an earnestness that was seldom seen in her wild and capricious\r\ncharacter. The thought occurred to Hester, that the child might really\r\nbe seeking to approach her with childlike confidence, and doing what\r\nshe could, and as intelligently as she knew how, to establish a\r\nmeeting-point of sympathy. It showed Pearl in an unwonted aspect.\r\nHeretofore, the mother, while loving her child with the intensity of a\r\nsole affection, had schooled herself to hope for little other return\r\nthan the waywardness of an April breeze; which spends its time in airy\r\nsport, and has its gusts of inexplicable passion, and is petulant in\r\nits best of moods, and chills oftener than caresses you, when you take\r\nit to your bosom; in requital of which misdemeanors, it will\r\nsometimes, of its own vague purpose, kiss your cheek with a kind of\r\ndoubtful tenderness, and play gently with your hair, and then be gone\r\nabout its other idle business, leaving a dreamy pleasure at your\r\nheart. And this, moreover, was a mother’s estimate of the child’s\r\ndisposition. Any other observer might have seen few but unamiable\r\ntraits, and have given them a far darker coloring. But now the idea\r\ncame strongly into Hester’s mind, that Pearl, with her remarkable\r\nprecocity and acuteness, might already have approached the age when\r\nshe could be made a friend, and intrusted with as much of her mother’s\r\nsorrows as could be imparted, without irreverence either to the parent\r\nor the child. In the little chaos of Pearl’s character there might be\r\nseen emerging—and could have been, from the very first—the steadfast\r\nprinciples of an unflinching courage,—an uncontrollable will,—a\r\nsturdy pride, which might be disciplined into self-respect,—and a\r\nbitter scorn of many things, which, when examined, might be found to\r\nhave the taint of falsehood in them. She possessed affections, too,\r\nthough hitherto acrid and disagreeable, as are the richest flavors of\r\nunripe fruit. With all these sterling attributes, thought Hester, the\r\nevil which she inherited from her mother must be great indeed, if a\r\nnoble woman do not grow out of this elfish child.\r\n\r\nPearl’s inevitable tendency to hover about the enigma of the scarlet\r\nletter seemed an innate quality of her being. From the earliest epoch\r\nof her conscious life, she had entered upon this as her appointed\r\nmission. Hester had often fancied that Providence had a design of\r\njustice and retribution, in endowing the child with this marked\r\npropensity; but never, until now, had she bethought herself to ask,\r\nwhether, linked with that design, there might not likewise be a\r\npurpose of mercy and beneficence. If little Pearl were entertained\r\nwith faith and trust, as a spirit messenger no less than an earthly\r\nchild, might it not be her errand to soothe away the sorrow that lay\r\ncold in her mother’s heart, and converted it into a tomb?—and to help\r\nher to overcome the passion, once so wild, and even yet neither dead\r\nnor asleep, but only imprisoned within the same tomb-like heart?\r\n\r\nSuch were some of the thoughts that now stirred in Hester’s mind, with\r\nas much vivacity of impression as if they had actually been whispered\r\ninto her ear. And there was little Pearl, all this while, holding her\r\nmother’s hand in both her own, and turning her face upward, while she\r\nput these searching questions, once, and again, and still a third\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n“What does the letter mean, mother?—and why dost thou wear it?—and\r\nwhy does the minister keep his hand over his heart?”\r\n\r\n“What shall I say?” thought Hester to herself. “No! If this be the\r\nprice of the child’s sympathy, I cannot pay it.”\r\n\r\nThen she spoke aloud.\r\n\r\n“Silly Pearl,” said she, “what questions are these? There are many\r\nthings in this world that a child must not ask about. What know I of\r\nthe minister’s heart? And as for the scarlet letter, I wear it for the\r\nsake of its gold-thread.”\r\n\r\nIn all the seven bygone years, Hester Prynne had never before been\r\nfalse to the symbol on her bosom. It may be that it was the talisman\r\nof a stern and severe, but yet a guardian spirit, who now forsook her;\r\nas recognizing that, in spite of his strict watch over her heart, some\r\nnew evil had crept into it, or some old one had never been expelled.\r\nAs for little Pearl, the earnestness soon passed out of her face.\r\n\r\nBut the child did not see fit to let the matter drop. Two or three\r\ntimes, as her mother and she went homeward, and as often at\r\nsupper-time, and while Hester was putting her to bed, and once after\r\nshe seemed to be fairly asleep, Pearl looked up, with mischief\r\ngleaming in her black eyes.\r\n\r\n“Mother,” said she, “what does the scarlet letter mean?”\r\n\r\nAnd the next morning, the first indication the child gave of being\r\nawake was by popping up her head from the pillow, and making that\r\nother inquiry, which she had so unaccountably connected with her\r\ninvestigations about the scarlet letter:—\r\n\r\n“Mother!—Mother!—Why does the minister keep his hand over his\r\nheart?”\r\n\r\n“Hold thy tongue, naughty child!” answered her mother, with an\r\nasperity that she had never permitted to herself before. “Do not tease\r\nme; else I shall shut thee into the dark closet!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\n [Illustration]"

      "content": "A FOREST WALK.\r\n\nHester Prynne remained constant in her resolve to make known to Mr.\r\nDimmesdale, at whatever risk of present pain or ulterior consequences,\r\nthe true character of the man who had crept into his intimacy. For\r\nseveral days, however, she vainly sought an opportunity of addressing\r\nhim in some of the meditative walks which she knew him to be in the\r\nhabit of taking, along the shores of the peninsula, or on the wooded\r\nhills of the neighboring country. There would have been no scandal,\r\nindeed, nor peril to the holy whiteness of the clergyman’s good fame,\r\nhad she visited him in his own study; where many a penitent, ere now,\r\nhad confessed sins of perhaps as deep a dye as the one betokened by\r\nthe scarlet letter. But, partly that she dreaded the secret or\r\nundisguised interference of old Roger Chillingworth, and partly that\r\nher conscious heart imputed suspicion where none could have been felt,\r\nand partly that both the minister and she would need the whole wide\r\nworld to breathe in, while they talked together,—for all these\r\nreasons, Hester never thought of meeting him in any narrower privacy\r\nthan beneath the open sky.\r\n\r\nAt last, while attending in a sick-chamber, whither the Reverend Mr.\r\nDimmesdale had been summoned to make a prayer, she learnt that he had\r\ngone, the day before, to visit the Apostle Eliot, among his Indian\r\nconverts. He would probably return, by a certain hour, in the\r\nafternoon of the morrow. Betimes, therefore, the next day, Hester took\r\nlittle Pearl,—who was necessarily the companion of all her mother’s\r\nexpeditions, however inconvenient her presence,—and set forth.\r\n\r\nThe road, after the two wayfarers had crossed from the peninsula to\r\nthe mainland, was no other than a footpath. It straggled onward into\r\nthe mystery of the primeval forest. This hemmed it in so narrowly, and\r\nstood so black and dense on either side, and disclosed such imperfect\r\nglimpses of the sky above, that, to Hester’s mind, it imaged not amiss\r\nthe moral wilderness in which she had so long been wandering. The day\r\nwas chill and sombre. Overhead was a gray expanse of cloud, slightly\r\nstirred, however, by a breeze; so that a gleam of flickering sunshine\r\nmight now and then be seen at its solitary play along the path. This\r\nflitting cheerfulness was always at the farther extremity of some long\r\nvista through the forest. The sportive sunlight—feebly sportive, at\r\nbest, in the predominant pensiveness of the day and scene—withdrew\r\nitself as they came nigh, and left the spots where it had danced the\r\ndrearier, because they had hoped to find them bright.\r\n\r\n“Mother,” said little Pearl, “the sunshine does not love you. It runs\r\naway and hides itself, because it is afraid of something on your\r\nbosom. Now, see! There it is, playing, a good way off. Stand you\r\nhere, and let me run and catch it. I am but a child. It will not flee\r\nfrom me; for I wear nothing on my bosom yet!”\r\n\r\n“Nor ever will, my child, I hope,” said Hester.\r\n\r\n“And why not, mother?” asked Pearl, stopping short, just at the\r\nbeginning of her race. “Will not it come of its own accord, when I am\r\na woman grown?”\r\n\r\n“Run away, child,” answered her mother, “and catch the sunshine! It\r\nwill soon be gone.”\r\n\r\nPearl set forth, at a great pace, and, as Hester smiled to perceive,\r\ndid actually catch the sunshine, and stood laughing in the midst of\r\nit, all brightened by its splendor, and scintillating with the\r\nvivacity excited by rapid motion. The light lingered about the lonely\r\nchild, as if glad of such a playmate, until her mother had drawn\r\nalmost nigh enough to step into the magic circle too.\r\n\r\n“It will go now,” said Pearl, shaking her head.\r\n\r\n“See!” answered Hester, smiling. “Now I can stretch out my hand, and\r\ngrasp some of it.”\r\n\r\nAs she attempted to do so, the sunshine vanished; or, to judge from\r\nthe bright expression that was dancing on Pearl’s features, her mother\r\ncould have fancied that the child had absorbed it into herself, and\r\nwould give it forth again, with a gleam about her path, as they should\r\nplunge into some gloomier shade. There was no other attribute that so\r\nmuch impressed her with a sense of new and untransmitted vigor in\r\nPearl’s nature, as this never-failing vivacity of spirits; she had not\r\nthe disease of sadness, which almost all children, in these latter\r\ndays, inherit, with the scrofula, from the troubles of their\r\nancestors. Perhaps this too was a disease, and but the reflex of the\r\nwild energy with which Hester had fought against her sorrows, before\r\nPearl’s birth. It was certainly a doubtful charm, imparting a hard,\r\nmetallic lustre to the child’s character. She wanted—what some people\r\nwant throughout life—a grief that should deeply touch her, and thus\r\nhumanize and make her capable of sympathy. But there was time enough\r\nyet for little Pearl.\r\n\r\n“Come, my child!” said Hester, looking about her from the spot where\r\nPearl had stood still in the sunshine. “We will sit down a little way\r\nwithin the wood, and rest ourselves.”\r\n\r\n“I am not aweary, mother,” replied the little girl. “But you may sit\r\ndown, if you will tell me a story meanwhile.”\r\n\r\n“A story, child!” said Hester. “And about what?”\r\n\r\n“O, a story about the Black Man,” answered Pearl, taking hold of her\r\nmother’s gown, and looking up, half earnestly, half mischievously,\r\ninto her face. “How he haunts this forest, and carries a book with\r\nhim,—a big, heavy book, with iron clasps; and how this ugly Black Man\r\noffers his book and an iron pen to everybody that meets him here among\r\nthe trees; and they are to write their names with their own blood. And\r\nthen he sets his mark on their bosoms! Didst thou ever meet the Black\r\nMan, mother?”\r\n\r\n“And who told you this story, Pearl?” asked her mother, recognizing a\r\ncommon superstition of the period.\r\n\r\n“It was the old dame in the chimney-corner, at the house where you\r\nwatched last night,” said the child. “But she fancied me asleep while\r\nshe was talking of it. She said that a thousand and a thousand people\r\nhad met him here, and had written in his book, and have his mark on\r\nthem. And that ugly-tempered lady, old Mistress Hibbins, was one. And,\r\nmother, the old dame said that this scarlet letter was the Black Man’s\r\nmark on thee, and that it glows like a red flame when thou meetest\r\nhim at midnight, here in the dark wood. Is it true, mother? And dost\r\nthou go to meet him in the night-time?”\r\n\r\n“Didst thou ever awake, and find thy mother gone?” asked Hester.\r\n\r\n“Not that I remember,” said the child. “If thou fearest to leave me in\r\nour cottage, thou mightest take me along with thee. I would very\r\ngladly go! But, mother, tell me now! Is there such a Black Man? And\r\ndidst thou ever meet him? And is this his mark?”\r\n\r\n“Wilt thou let me be at peace, if I once tell thee?” asked her mother.\r\n\r\n“Yes, if thou tellest me all,” answered Pearl.\r\n\r\n“Once in my life I met the Black Man!” said her mother. “This scarlet\r\nletter is his mark!”\r\n\r\nThus conversing, they entered sufficiently deep into the wood to\r\nsecure themselves from the observation of any casual passenger along\r\nthe forest track. Here they sat down on a luxuriant heap of moss;\r\nwhich, at some epoch of the preceding century, had been a gigantic\r\npine, with its roots and trunk in the darksome shade, and its head\r\naloft in the upper atmosphere. It was a little dell where they had\r\nseated themselves, with a leaf-strewn bank rising gently on either\r\nside, and a brook flowing through the midst, over a bed of fallen and\r\ndrowned leaves. The trees impending over it had flung down great\r\nbranches, from time to time, which choked up the current and compelled\r\nit to form eddies and black depths at some points; while, in its\r\nswifter and livelier passages, there appeared a channel-way of\r\npebbles, and brown, sparkling sand. Letting the eyes follow along the\r\ncourse of the stream, they could catch the reflected light from its\r\nwater, at some short distance within the forest, but soon lost all\r\ntraces of it amid the bewilderment of tree-trunks and underbrush, and\r\nhere and there a huge rock covered over with gray lichens. All these\r\ngiant trees and bowlders of granite seemed intent on making a mystery\r\nof the course of this small brook; fearing, perhaps, that, with its\r\nnever-ceasing loquacity, it should whisper tales out of the heart of\r\nthe old forest whence it flowed, or mirror its revelations on the\r\nsmooth surface of a pool. Continually, indeed, as it stole onward, the\r\nstreamlet kept up a babble, kind, quiet, soothing, but melancholy,\r\nlike the voice of a young child that was spending its infancy without\r\nplayfulness, and knew not how to be merry among sad acquaintance and\r\nevents of sombre hue.\r\n\r\n“O brook! O foolish and tiresome little brook!” cried Pearl, after\r\nlistening awhile to its talk. “Why art thou so sad? Pluck up a spirit,\r\nand do not be all the time sighing and murmuring!”\r\n\r\nBut the brook, in the course of its little lifetime among the\r\nforest-trees, had gone through so solemn an experience that it could\r\nnot help talking about it, and seemed to have nothing else to say.\r\nPearl resembled the brook, inasmuch as the current of her life gushed\r\nfrom a well-spring as mysterious, and had flowed through scenes\r\nshadowed as heavily with gloom. But, unlike the little stream, she\r\ndanced and sparkled, and prattled airily along her course.\r\n\r\n“What does this sad little brook say, mother?” inquired she.\r\n\r\n“If thou hadst a sorrow of thine own, the brook might tell thee of\r\nit,” answered her mother, “even as it is telling me of mine! But now,\r\nPearl, I hear a footstep along the path, and the noise of one putting\r\naside the branches. I would have thee betake thyself to play, and\r\nleave me to speak with him that comes yonder.”\r\n\r\n“Is it the Black Man?” asked Pearl.\r\n\r\n“Wilt thou go and play, child?” repeated her mother. “But do not stray\r\nfar into the wood. And take heed that thou come at my first call.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, mother,” answered Pearl. “But if it be the Black Man, wilt thou\r\nnot let me stay a moment, and look at him, with his big book under his\r\narm?”\r\n\r\n“Go, silly child!” said her mother, impatiently. “It is no Black Man!\r\nThou canst see him now, through the trees. It is the minister!”\r\n\r\n“And so it is!” said the child. “And, mother, he has his hand over his\r\nheart! Is it because, when the minister wrote his name in the book,\r\nthe Black Man set his mark in that place? But why does he not wear it\r\noutside his bosom, as thou dost, mother?”\r\n\r\n“Go now, child, and thou shalt tease me as thou wilt another time,”\r\ncried Hester Prynne. “But do not stray far. Keep where thou canst hear\r\nthe babble of the brook.”\r\n\r\nThe child went singing away, following up the current of the brook,\r\nand striving to mingle a more lightsome cadence with its melancholy\r\nvoice. But the little stream would not be comforted, and still kept\r\ntelling its unintelligible secret of some very mournful mystery that\r\nhad happened—or making a prophetic lamentation about something that\r\nwas yet to happen—within the verge of the dismal forest. So Pearl,\r\nwho had enough of shadow in her own little life, chose to break off\r\nall acquaintance with this repining brook. She set herself, therefore,\r\nto gathering violets and wood-anemones, and some scarlet columbines\r\nthat she found growing in the crevices of a high rock.\r\n\r\nWhen her elf-child had departed, Hester Prynne made a step or two\r\ntowards the track that led through the forest, but still remained\r\nunder the deep shadow of the trees. She beheld the minister advancing\r\nalong the path, entirely alone, and leaning on a staff which he had\r\ncut by the wayside. He looked haggard and feeble, and betrayed a\r\nnerveless despondency in his air, which had never so remarkably\r\ncharacterized him in his walks about the settlement, nor in any other\r\nsituation where he deemed himself liable to notice. Here it was\r\nwofully visible, in this intense seclusion of the forest, which of\r\nitself would have been a heavy trial to the spirits. There was a\r\nlistlessness in his gait; as if he saw no reason for taking one step\r\nfarther, nor felt any desire to do so, but would have been glad, could\r\nhe be glad of anything, to fling himself down at the root of the\r\nnearest tree, and lie there passive, forevermore. The leaves might\r\nbestrew him, and the soil gradually accumulate and form a little\r\nhillock over his frame, no matter whether there were life in it or no.\r\nDeath was too definite an object to be wished for, or avoided.\r\n\r\nTo Hester’s eye, the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale exhibited no symptom of\r\npositive and vivacious suffering, except that, as little Pearl had\r\nremarked, he kept his hand over his heart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\n [Illustration]"

      "content": "THE PASTOR AND HIS PARISHIONER.\r\n\nSlowly as the minister walked, he had almost gone by, before Hester\r\nPrynne could gather voice enough to attract his observation. At\r\nlength, she succeeded.\r\n\r\n“Arthur Dimmesdale!” she said, faintly at first; then louder, but\r\nhoarsely. “Arthur Dimmesdale!”\r\n\r\n“Who speaks?” answered the minister.\r\n\r\nGathering himself quickly up, he stood more erect, like a man taken by\r\nsurprise in a mood to which he was reluctant to have witnesses.\r\nThrowing his eyes anxiously in the direction of the voice, he\r\nindistinctly beheld a form under the trees, clad in garments so\r\nsombre, and so little relieved from the gray twilight into which the\r\nclouded sky and the heavy foliage had darkened the noontide, that he\r\nknew not whether it were a woman or a shadow. It may be, that his\r\npathway through life was haunted thus, by a spectre that had stolen\r\nout from among his thoughts.\r\n\r\nHe made a step nigher, and discovered the scarlet letter.\r\n\r\n“Hester! Hester Prynne!” said he. “Is it thou? Art thou in life?”\r\n\r\n“Even so!” she answered. “In such life as has been mine these seven\r\nyears past! And thou, Arthur Dimmesdale, dost thou yet live?”\r\n\r\nIt was no wonder that they thus questioned one another’s actual and\r\nbodily existence, and even doubted of their own. So strangely did they\r\nmeet, in the dim wood, that it was like the first encounter, in the\r\nworld beyond the grave, of two spirits who had been intimately\r\nconnected in their former life, but now stood coldly shuddering, in\r\nmutual dread; as not yet familiar with their state, nor wonted to the\r\ncompanionship of disembodied beings. Each a ghost, and awe-stricken at\r\nthe other ghost! They were awe-stricken likewise at themselves;\r\nbecause the crisis flung back to them their consciousness, and\r\nrevealed to each heart its history and experience, as life never does,\r\nexcept at such breathless epochs. The soul beheld its features in the\r\nmirror of the passing moment. It was with fear, and tremulously, and,\r\nas it were, by a slow, reluctant necessity, that Arthur Dimmesdale put\r\nforth his hand, chill as death, and touched the chill hand of Hester\r\nPrynne. The grasp, cold as it was, took away what was dreariest in the\r\ninterview. They now felt themselves, at least, inhabitants of the same\r\nsphere.\r\n\r\nWithout a word more spoken,—neither he nor she assuming the guidance,\r\nbut with an unexpressed consent,—they glided back into the shadow of\r\nthe woods, whence Hester had emerged, and sat down on the heap of moss\r\nwhere she and Pearl had before been sitting. When they found voice to\r\nspeak, it was, at first, only to utter remarks and inquiries such as\r\nany two acquaintance might have made, about the gloomy sky, the\r\nthreatening storm, and, next, the health of each. Thus they went\r\nonward, not boldly, but step by step, into the themes that were\r\nbrooding deepest in their hearts. So long estranged by fate and\r\ncircumstances, they needed something slight and casual to run before,\r\nand throw open the doors of intercourse, so that their real thoughts\r\nmight be led across the threshold.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, the minister fixed his eyes on Hester Prynne’s.\r\n\r\n“Hester,” said he, “hast thou found peace?”\r\n\r\nShe smiled drearily, looking down upon her bosom.\r\n\r\n“Hast thou?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“None!—nothing but despair!” he answered. “What else could I look\r\nfor, being what I am, and leading such a life as mine? Were I an\r\natheist,—a man devoid of conscience,—a wretch with coarse and brutal\r\ninstincts,—I might have found peace, long ere now. Nay, I never\r\nshould have lost it! But, as matters stand with my soul, whatever of\r\ngood capacity there originally was in me, all of God’s gifts that were\r\nthe choicest have become the ministers of spiritual torment. Hester, I\r\nam most miserable!”\r\n\r\n“The people reverence thee,” said Hester. “And surely thou workest\r\ngood among them! Doth this bring thee no comfort?”\r\n\r\n“More misery, Hester!—only the more misery!” answered the clergyman,\r\nwith a bitter smile. “As concerns the good which I may appear to do, I\r\nhave no faith in it. It must needs be a delusion. What can a ruined\r\nsoul, like mine, effect towards the redemption of other souls?—or a\r\npolluted soul towards their purification? And as for the people’s\r\nreverence, would that it were turned to scorn and hatred! Canst thou\r\ndeem it, Hester, a consolation, that I must stand up in my pulpit, and\r\nmeet so many eyes turned upward to my face, as if the light of heaven\r\nwere beaming from it!—must see my flock hungry for the truth, and\r\nlistening to my words as if a tongue of Pentecost were speaking!—and\r\nthen look inward, and discern the black reality of what they idolize?\r\nI have laughed, in bitterness and agony of heart, at the contrast\r\nbetween what I seem and what I am! And Satan laughs at it!”\r\n\r\n“You wrong yourself in this,” said Hester, gently. “You have deeply\r\nand sorely repented. Your sin is left behind you, in the days long\r\npast. Your present life is not less holy, in very truth, than it seems\r\nin people’s eyes. Is there no reality in the penitence thus sealed and\r\nwitnessed by good works? And wherefore should it not bring you peace?”\r\n\r\n“No, Hester, no!” replied the clergyman. “There is no substance in it!\r\nIt is cold and dead, and can do nothing for me! Of penance, I have had\r\nenough! Of penitence, there has been none! Else, I should long ago\r\nhave thrown off these garments of mock holiness, and have shown myself\r\nto mankind as they will see me at the judgment-seat. Happy are you,\r\nHester, that wear the scarlet letter openly upon your bosom! Mine\r\nburns in secret! Thou little knowest what a relief it is, after the\r\ntorment of a seven years’ cheat, to look into an eye that recognizes\r\nme for what I am! Had I one friend,—or were it my worst enemy!—to\r\nwhom, when sickened with the praises of all other men, I could daily\r\nbetake myself, and be known as the vilest of all sinners, methinks my\r\nsoul might keep itself alive thereby. Even thus much of truth would\r\nsave me! But, now, it is all falsehood!—all emptiness!—all death!”\r\n\r\nHester Prynne looked into his face, but hesitated to speak. Yet,\r\nuttering his long-restrained emotions so vehemently as he did, his\r\nwords here offered her the very point of circumstances in which to\r\ninterpose what she came to say. She conquered her fears, and spoke.\r\n\r\n“Such a friend as thou hast even now wished for,” said she, “with whom\r\nto weep over thy sin, thou hast in me, the partner of it!”—Again she\r\nhesitated, but brought out the words with an effort.—“Thou hast long\r\nhad such an enemy, and dwellest with him, under the same roof!”\r\n\r\nThe minister started to his feet, gasping for breath, and clutching at\r\nhis heart, as if he would have torn it out of his bosom.\r\n\r\n“Ha! What sayest thou!” cried he. “An enemy! And under mine own roof!\r\nWhat mean you?”\r\n\r\nHester Prynne was now fully sensible of the deep injury for which she\r\nwas responsible to this unhappy man, in permitting him to lie for so\r\nmany years, or, indeed, for a single moment, at the mercy of one whose\r\npurposes could not be other than malevolent. The very contiguity of\r\nhis enemy, beneath whatever mask the latter might conceal himself, was\r\nenough to disturb the magnetic sphere of a being so sensitive as\r\nArthur Dimmesdale. There had been a period when Hester was less alive\r\nto this consideration; or, perhaps, in the misanthropy of her own\r\ntrouble, she left the minister to bear what she might picture to\r\nherself as a more tolerable doom. But of late, since the night of his\r\nvigil, all her sympathies towards him had been both softened and\r\ninvigorated. She now read his heart more accurately. She doubted not,\r\nthat the continual presence of Roger Chillingworth,—the secret poison\r\nof his malignity, infecting all the air about him,—and his authorized\r\ninterference, as a physician, with the minister’s physical and\r\nspiritual infirmities,—that these bad opportunities had been turned\r\nto a cruel purpose. By means of them, the sufferer’s conscience had\r\nbeen kept in an irritated state, the tendency of which was, not to\r\ncure by wholesome pain, but to disorganize and corrupt his spiritual\r\nbeing. Its result, on earth, could hardly fail to be insanity, and\r\nhereafter, that eternal alienation from the Good and True, of which\r\nmadness is perhaps the earthly type.\r\n\r\nSuch was the ruin to which she had brought the man, once,—nay, why\r\nshould we not speak it?—still so passionately loved! Hester felt that\r\nthe sacrifice of the clergyman’s good name, and death itself, as she\r\nhad already told Roger Chillingworth, would have been infinitely\r\npreferable to the alternative which she had taken upon herself to\r\nchoose. And now, rather than have had this grievous wrong to confess,\r\nshe would gladly have lain down on the forest-leaves, and died there,\r\nat Arthur Dimmesdale’s feet.\r\n\r\n“O Arthur,” cried she, “forgive me! In all things else, I have striven\r\nto be true! Truth was the one virtue which I might have held fast, and\r\ndid hold fast, through all extremity; save when thy good,—thy\r\nlife,—thy fame,—were put in question! Then I consented to a\r\ndeception. But a lie is never good, even though death threaten on the\r\nother side! Dost thou not see what I would say? That old man!—the\r\nphysician!—he whom they call Roger Chillingworth!—he was my\r\nhusband!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Wilt thou yet forgive me?”]\r\n\r\nThe minister looked at her, for an instant, with all that violence of\r\npassion, which—intermixed, in more shapes than one, with his higher,\r\npurer, softer qualities—was, in fact, the portion of him which the\r\nDevil claimed, and through which he sought to win the rest. Never was\r\nthere a blacker or a fiercer frown than Hester now encountered. For\r\nthe brief space that it lasted, it was a dark transfiguration. But his\r\ncharacter had been so much enfeebled by suffering, that even its\r\nlower energies were incapable of more than a temporary struggle. He\r\nsank down on the ground, and buried his face in his hands.\r\n\r\n“I might have known it,” murmured he. “I did know it! Was not the\r\nsecret told me, in the natural recoil of my heart, at the first sight\r\nof him, and as often as I have seen him since? Why did I not\r\nunderstand? O Hester Prynne, thou little, little knowest all the\r\nhorror of this thing! And the shame!—the indelicacy!—the horrible\r\nugliness of this exposure of a sick and guilty heart to the very eye\r\nthat would gloat over it! Woman, woman, thou art accountable for this!\r\nI cannot forgive thee!”\r\n\r\n“Thou shalt forgive me!” cried Hester, flinging herself on the fallen\r\nleaves beside him. “Let God punish! Thou shalt forgive!”\r\n\r\nWith sudden and desperate tenderness, she threw her arms around him,\r\nand pressed his head against her bosom; little caring though his cheek\r\nrested on the scarlet letter. He would have released himself, but\r\nstrove in vain to do so. Hester would not set him free, lest he should\r\nlook her sternly in the face. All the world had frowned on her,—for\r\nseven long years had it frowned upon this lonely woman,—and still she\r\nbore it all, nor ever once turned away her firm, sad eyes. Heaven,\r\nlikewise, had frowned upon her, and she had not died. But the frown of\r\nthis pale, weak, sinful, and sorrow-stricken man was what Hester could\r\nnot bear and live!\r\n\r\n“Wilt thou yet forgive me?” she repeated, over and over again. “Wilt\r\nthou not frown? Wilt thou forgive?”\r\n\r\n“I do forgive you, Hester,” replied the minister, at length, with a\r\ndeep utterance, out of an abyss of sadness, but no anger. “I freely\r\nforgive you now. May God forgive us both! We are not, Hester, the\r\nworst sinners in the world. There is one worse than even the polluted\r\npriest! That old man’s revenge has been blacker than my sin. He has\r\nviolated, in cold blood, the sanctity of a human heart. Thou and I,\r\nHester, never did so!”\r\n\r\n“Never, never!” whispered she. “What we did had a consecration of its\r\nown. We felt it so! We said so to each other! Hast thou forgotten it?”\r\n\r\n“Hush, Hester!” said Arthur Dimmesdale, rising from the ground. “No; I\r\nhave not forgotten!”\r\n\r\nThey sat down again, side by side, and hand clasped in hand, on the\r\nmossy trunk of the fallen tree. Life had never brought them a gloomier\r\nhour; it was the point whither their pathway had so long been tending,\r\nand darkening ever, as it stole along;—and yet it enclosed a charm\r\nthat made them linger upon it, and claim another, and another, and,\r\nafter all, another moment. The forest was obscure around them, and\r\ncreaked with a blast that was passing through it. The boughs were\r\ntossing heavily above their heads; while one solemn old tree groaned\r\ndolefully to another, as if telling the sad story of the pair that sat\r\nbeneath, or constrained to forebode evil to come.\r\n\r\nAnd yet they lingered. How dreary looked the forest-track that led\r\nbackward to the settlement, where Hester Prynne must take up again the\r\nburden of her ignominy, and the minister the hollow mockery of his\r\ngood name! So they lingered an instant longer. No golden light had\r\never been so precious as the gloom of this dark forest. Here, seen\r\nonly by his eyes, the scarlet letter need not burn into the bosom of\r\nthe fallen woman! Here, seen only by her eyes, Arthur Dimmesdale,\r\nfalse to God and man, might be, for one moment, true!\r\n\r\nHe started at a thought that suddenly occurred to him.\r\n\r\n“Hester,” cried he, “here is a new horror! Roger Chillingworth knows\r\nyour purpose to reveal his true character. Will he continue, then, to\r\nkeep our secret? What will now be the course of his revenge?”\r\n\r\n“There is a strange secrecy in his nature,” replied Hester,\r\nthoughtfully; “and it has grown upon him by the hidden practices of\r\nhis revenge. I deem it not likely that he will betray the secret. He\r\nwill doubtless seek other means of satiating his dark passion.”\r\n\r\n“And I!—how am I to live longer, breathing the same air with this\r\ndeadly enemy?” exclaimed Arthur Dimmesdale, shrinking within himself,\r\nand pressing his hand nervously against his heart,—a gesture that had\r\ngrown involuntary with him.\r\n\r\n“Think for me, Hester! Thou art strong. Resolve for me!”\r\n\r\n“Thou must dwell no longer with this man,” said Hester, slowly and\r\nfirmly. “Thy heart must be no longer under his evil eye!”\r\n\r\n“It were far worse than death!” replied the minister. “But how to\r\navoid it? What choice remains to me? Shall I lie down again on these\r\nwithered leaves, where I cast myself when thou didst tell me what he\r\nwas? Must I sink down there, and die at once?”\r\n\r\n“Alas, what a ruin has befallen thee!” said Hester, with the tears\r\ngushing into her eyes. “Wilt thou die for very weakness? There is no\r\nother cause!”\r\n\r\n“The judgment of God is on me,” answered the conscience-stricken\r\npriest. “It is too mighty for me to struggle with!”\r\n\r\n“Heaven would show mercy,” rejoined Hester, “hadst thou but the\r\nstrength to take advantage of it.”\r\n\r\n“Be thou strong for me!” answered he. “Advise me what to do.”\r\n\r\n“Is the world, then, so narrow?” exclaimed Hester Prynne, fixing her\r\ndeep eyes on the minister’s, and instinctively exercising a magnetic\r\npower over a spirit so shattered and subdued that it could hardly hold\r\nitself erect. “Doth the universe lie within the compass of yonder\r\ntown, which only a little time ago was but a leaf-strewn desert, as\r\nlonely as this around us? Whither leads yonder forest-track? Backward\r\nto the settlement, thou sayest! Yes; but onward, too. Deeper it goes,\r\nand deeper, into the wilderness, less plainly to be seen at every\r\nstep; until, some few miles hence, the yellow leaves will show no\r\nvestige of the white man’s tread. There thou art free! So brief a\r\njourney would bring thee from a world where thou hast been most\r\nwretched, to one where thou mayest still be happy! Is there not shade\r\nenough in all this boundless forest to hide thy heart from the gaze of\r\nRoger Chillingworth?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Hester; but only under the fallen leaves!” replied the minister,\r\nwith a sad smile.\r\n\r\n“Then there is the broad pathway of the sea!” continued Hester. “It\r\nbrought thee hither. If thou so choose, it will bear thee back again.\r\nIn our native land, whether in some remote rural village or in vast\r\nLondon,—or, surely, in Germany, in France, in pleasant Italy,—thou\r\nwouldst be beyond his power and knowledge! And what hast thou to do\r\nwith all these iron men, and their opinions? They have kept thy better\r\npart in bondage too long already!”\r\n\r\n“It cannot be!” answered the minister, listening as if he were called\r\nupon to realize a dream. “I am powerless to go! Wretched and sinful as\r\nI am, I have had no other thought than to drag on my earthly\r\nexistence in the sphere where Providence hath placed me. Lost as my\r\nown soul is, I would still do what I may for other human souls! I dare\r\nnot quit my post, though an unfaithful sentinel, whose sure reward is\r\ndeath and dishonor, when his dreary watch shall come to an end!”\r\n\r\n“Thou art crushed under this seven years’ weight of misery,” replied\r\nHester, fervently resolved to buoy him up with her own energy. “But\r\nthou shalt leave it all behind thee! It shall not cumber thy steps, as\r\nthou treadest along the forest-path; neither shalt thou freight the\r\nship with it, if thou prefer to cross the sea. Leave this wreck and\r\nruin here where it hath happened. Meddle no more with it! Begin all\r\nanew! Hast thou exhausted possibility in the failure of this one\r\ntrial? Not so! The future is yet full of trial and success. There is\r\nhappiness to be enjoyed! There is good to be done! Exchange this false\r\nlife of thine for a true one. Be, if thy spirit summon thee to such a\r\nmission, the teacher and apostle of the red men. Or,—as is more thy\r\nnature,—be a scholar and a sage among the wisest and the most\r\nrenowned of the cultivated world. Preach! Write! Act! Do anything,\r\nsave to lie down and die! Give up this name of Arthur Dimmesdale, and\r\nmake thyself another, and a high one, such as thou canst wear without\r\nfear or shame. Why shouldst thou tarry so much as one other day in the\r\ntorments that have so gnawed into thy life!—that have made thee\r\nfeeble to will and to do!—that will leave thee powerless even to\r\nrepent! Up, and away!”\r\n\r\n“O Hester!” cried Arthur Dimmesdale, in whose eyes a fitful light,\r\nkindled by her enthusiasm, flashed up and died away, “thou tellest of\r\nrunning a race to a man whose knees are tottering beneath him! I must\r\ndie here! There is not the strength or courage left me to venture\r\ninto the wide, strange, difficult world, alone!”\r\n\r\nIt was the last expression of the despondency of a broken spirit. He\r\nlacked energy to grasp the better fortune that seemed within his\r\nreach.\r\n\r\nHe repeated the word.\r\n\r\n“Alone, Hester!”\r\n\r\n“Thou shalt not go alone!” answered she, in a deep whisper.\r\n\r\nThen, all was spoken!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\n [Illustration]"

      "content": "A FLOOD OF SUNSHINE.\r\n\nArthur Dimmesdale gazed into Hester’s face with a look in which hope\r\nand joy shone out, indeed, but with fear betwixt them, and a kind of\r\nhorror at her boldness, who had spoken what he vaguely hinted at, but\r\ndared not speak.\r\n\r\nBut Hester Prynne, with a mind of native courage and activity, and for\r\nso long a period not merely estranged, but outlawed, from society, had\r\nhabituated herself to such latitude of speculation as was altogether\r\nforeign to the clergyman. She had wandered, without rule or guidance,\r\nin a moral wilderness; as vast, as intricate and shadowy, as the\r\nuntamed forest, amid the gloom of which they were now holding a\r\ncolloquy that was to decide their fate. Her intellect and heart had\r\ntheir home, as it were, in desert places, where she roamed as freely\r\nas the wild Indian in his woods. For years past she had looked from\r\nthis estranged point of view at human institutions, and whatever\r\npriests or legislators had established; criticising all with hardly\r\nmore reverence than the Indian would feel for the clerical band, the\r\njudicial robe, the pillory, the gallows, the fireside, or the church.\r\nThe tendency of her fate and fortunes had been to set her free. The\r\nscarlet letter was her passport into regions where other women dared\r\nnot tread. Shame, Despair, Solitude! These had been her\r\nteachers,—stern and wild ones,—and they had made her strong, but\r\ntaught her much amiss.\r\n\r\nThe minister, on the other hand, had never gone through an experience\r\ncalculated to lead him beyond the scope of generally received laws;\r\nalthough, in a single instance, he had so fearfully transgressed one\r\nof the most sacred of them. But this had been a sin of passion, not of\r\nprinciple, nor even purpose. Since that wretched epoch, he had\r\nwatched, with morbid zeal and minuteness, not his acts,—for those it\r\nwas easy to arrange,—but each breath of emotion, and his every\r\nthought. At the head of the social system, as the clergymen of that\r\nday stood, he was only the more trammelled by its regulations, its\r\nprinciples, and even its prejudices. As a priest, the framework of his\r\norder inevitably hemmed him in. As a man who had once sinned, but who\r\nkept his conscience all alive and painfully sensitive by the fretting\r\nof an unhealed wound, he might have been supposed safer within the\r\nline of virtue than if he had never sinned at all.\r\n\r\nThus, we seem to see that, as regarded Hester Prynne, the whole seven\r\nyears of outlaw and ignominy had been little other than a preparation\r\nfor this very hour. But Arthur Dimmesdale! Were such a man once more\r\nto fall, what plea could be urged in extenuation of his crime? None;\r\nunless it avail him somewhat, that he was broken down by long and\r\nexquisite suffering; that his mind was darkened and confused by the\r\nvery remorse which harrowed it; that, between fleeing as an avowed\r\ncriminal, and remaining as a hypocrite, conscience might find it hard\r\nto strike the balance; that it was human to avoid the peril of death\r\nand infamy, and the inscrutable machinations of an enemy; that,\r\nfinally, to this poor pilgrim, on his dreary and desert path, faint,\r\nsick, miserable, there appeared a glimpse of human affection and\r\nsympathy, a new life, and a true one, in exchange for the heavy doom\r\nwhich he was now expiating. And be the stern and sad truth spoken,\r\nthat the breach which guilt has once made into the human soul is\r\nnever, in this mortal state, repaired. It may be watched and guarded;\r\nso that the enemy shall not force his way again into the citadel, and\r\nmight even, in his subsequent assaults, select some other avenue, in\r\npreference to that where he had formerly succeeded. But there is still\r\nthe ruined wall, and, near it, the stealthy tread of the foe that\r\nwould win over again his unforgotten triumph.\r\n\r\nThe struggle, if there were one, need not be described. Let it\r\nsuffice, that the clergyman resolved to flee, and not alone.\r\n\r\n“If, in all these past seven years,” thought he, “I could recall one\r\ninstant of peace or hope, I would yet endure, for the sake of that\r\nearnest of Heaven’s mercy. But now,—since I am irrevocably\r\ndoomed,—wherefore should I not snatch the solace allowed to the\r\ncondemned culprit before his execution? Or, if this be the path to a\r\nbetter life, as Hester would persuade me, I surely give up no fairer\r\nprospect by pursuing it! Neither can I any longer live without her\r\ncompanionship; so powerful is she to sustain,—so tender to soothe! O\r\nThou to whom I dare not lift mine eyes, wilt Thou yet pardon me!”\r\n\r\n“Thou wilt go!” said Hester, calmly, as he met her glance.\r\n\r\nThe decision once made, a glow of strange enjoyment threw its\r\nflickering brightness over the trouble of his breast. It was the\r\nexhilarating effect—upon a prisoner just escaped from the dungeon of\r\nhis own heart—of breathing the wild, free atmosphere of an\r\nunredeemed, unchristianized, lawless region. His spirit rose, as it\r\nwere, with a bound, and attained a nearer prospect of the sky, than\r\nthroughout all the misery which had kept him grovelling on the earth.\r\nOf a deeply religious temperament, there was inevitably a tinge of the\r\ndevotional in his mood.\r\n\r\n“Do I feel joy again?” cried he, wondering at himself. “Methought the\r\ngerm of it was dead in me! O Hester, thou art my better angel! I seem\r\nto have flung myself—sick, sin-stained, and sorrow-blackened—down\r\nupon these forest-leaves, and to have risen up all made anew, and with\r\nnew powers to glorify Him that hath been merciful! This is already the\r\nbetter life! Why did we not find it sooner?”\r\n\r\n“Let us not look back,” answered Hester Prynne. “The past is gone!\r\nWherefore should we linger upon it now? See! With this symbol, I undo\r\nit all, and make it as it had never been!”\r\n\r\nSo speaking, she undid the clasp that fastened the scarlet letter,\r\nand, taking it from her bosom, threw it to a distance among the\r\nwithered leaves. The mystic token alighted on the hither verge of the\r\nstream. With a hand’s breadth farther flight it would have fallen into\r\nthe water, and have given the little brook another woe to carry\r\nonward, besides the unintelligible tale which it still kept murmuring\r\nabout. But there lay the embroidered letter, glittering like a lost\r\njewel, which some ill-fated wanderer might pick up, and thenceforth be\r\nhaunted by strange phantoms of guilt, sinkings of the heart, and\r\nunaccountable misfortune.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Gleam of Sunshine]\r\n\r\nThe stigma gone, Hester heaved a long, deep sigh, in which the burden\r\nof shame and anguish departed from her spirit. O exquisite relief! She\r\nhad not known the weight, until she felt the freedom! By another\r\nimpulse, she took off the formal cap that confined her hair; and down\r\nit fell upon her shoulders, dark and rich, with at once a shadow and a\r\nlight in its abundance, and imparting the charm of softness to her\r\nfeatures. There played around her mouth, and beamed out of her eyes, a\r\nradiant and tender smile, that seemed gushing from the very heart of\r\nwomanhood. A crimson flush was glowing on her cheek, that had been\r\nlong so pale. Her sex, her youth, and the whole richness of her\r\nbeauty, came back from what men call the irrevocable past, and\r\nclustered themselves, with her maiden hope, and a happiness before\r\nunknown, within the magic circle of this hour. And, as if the gloom of\r\nthe earth and sky had been but the effluence of these two mortal\r\nhearts, it vanished with their sorrow. All at once, as with a sudden\r\nsmile of heaven, forth burst the sunshine, pouring a very flood into\r\nthe obscure forest, gladdening each green leaf, transmuting the yellow\r\nfallen ones to gold, and gleaming adown the gray trunks of the solemn\r\ntrees. The objects that had made a shadow hitherto, embodied the\r\nbrightness now. The course of the little brook might be traced by its\r\nmerry gleam afar into the wood’s heart of mystery, which had become a\r\nmystery of joy.\r\n\r\nSuch was the sympathy of Nature—that wild, heathen Nature of the\r\nforest, never subjugated by human law, nor illumined by higher\r\ntruth—with the bliss of these two spirits! Love, whether newly born,\r\nor aroused from a death-like slumber, must always create a sunshine,\r\nfilling the heart so full of radiance, that it overflows upon the\r\noutward world. Had the forest still kept its gloom, it would have been\r\nbright in Hester’s eyes, and bright in Arthur Dimmesdale’s!\r\n\r\nHester looked at him with the thrill of another joy.\r\n\r\n“Thou must know Pearl!” said she. “Our little Pearl! Thou hast seen\r\nher,—yes, I know it!—but thou wilt see her now with other eyes. She\r\nis a strange child! I hardly comprehend her! But thou wilt love her\r\ndearly, as I do, and wilt advise me how to deal with her.”\r\n\r\n“Dost thou think the child will be glad to know me?” asked the\r\nminister, somewhat uneasily. “I have long shrunk from children,\r\nbecause they often show a distrust,—a backwardness to be familiar\r\nwith me. I have even been afraid of little Pearl!”\r\n\r\n“Ah, that was sad!” answered the mother. “But she will love thee\r\ndearly, and thou her. She is not far off. I will call her! Pearl!\r\nPearl!”\r\n\r\n“I see the child,” observed the minister. “Yonder she is, standing in\r\na streak of sunshine, a good way off, on the other side of the brook.\r\nSo thou thinkest the child will love me?”\r\n\r\nHester smiled, and again called to Pearl, who was visible, at some\r\ndistance, as the minister had described her, like a bright-apparelled\r\nvision, in a sunbeam, which fell down upon her through an arch of\r\nboughs. The ray quivered to and fro, making her figure dim or\r\ndistinct,—now like a real child, now like a child’s spirit,—as the\r\nsplendor went and came again. She heard her mother’s voice, and\r\napproached slowly through the forest.\r\n\r\nPearl had not found the hour pass wearisomely, while her mother sat\r\ntalking with the clergyman. The great black forest—stern as it showed\r\nitself to those who brought the guilt and troubles of the world into\r\nits bosom—became the playmate of the lonely infant, as well as it\r\nknew how. Sombre as it was, it put on the kindest of its moods to\r\nwelcome her. It offered her the partridge-berries, the growth of the\r\npreceding autumn, but ripening only in the spring, and now red as\r\ndrops of blood upon the withered leaves. These Pearl gathered, and was\r\npleased with their wild flavor. The small denizens of the wilderness\r\nhardly took pains to move out of her path. A partridge, indeed, with a\r\nbrood of ten behind her, ran forward threateningly, but soon repented\r\nof her fierceness, and clucked to her young ones not to be afraid. A\r\npigeon, alone on a low branch, allowed Pearl to come beneath, and\r\nuttered a sound as much of greeting as alarm. A squirrel, from the\r\nlofty depths of his domestic tree, chattered either in anger or\r\nmerriment,—for a squirrel is such a choleric and humorous little\r\npersonage, that it is hard to distinguish between his moods,—so he\r\nchattered at the child, and flung down a nut upon her head. It was a\r\nlast year’s nut, and already gnawed by his sharp tooth. A fox,\r\nstartled from his sleep by her light footstep on the leaves, looked\r\ninquisitively at Pearl, as doubting whether it were better to steal\r\noff, or renew his nap on the same spot. A wolf, it is said,—but here\r\nthe tale has surely lapsed into the improbable,—came up, and smelt of\r\nPearl’s robe, and offered his savage head to be patted by her hand.\r\nThe truth seems to be, however, that the mother-forest, and these wild\r\nthings which it nourished, all recognized a kindred wildness in the\r\nhuman child.\r\n\r\nAnd she was gentler here than in the grassy-margined streets of the\r\nsettlement, or in her mother’s cottage. The flowers appeared to know\r\nit; and one and another whispered as she passed, “Adorn thyself with\r\nme, thou beautiful child, adorn thyself with me!”—and, to please\r\nthem, Pearl gathered the violets, and anemones, and columbines, and\r\nsome twigs of the freshest green, which the old trees held down before\r\nher eyes. With these she decorated her hair, and her young waist, and\r\nbecame a nymph-child, or an infant dryad, or whatever else was in\r\nclosest sympathy with the antique wood. In such guise had Pearl\r\nadorned herself, when she heard her mother’s voice, and came slowly\r\nback.\r\n\r\nSlowly; for she saw the clergyman.\r\n\n [Illustration]"

And see with what natural skill she has made those simple\r\nflowers adorn her! Had she gathered pearls, and diamonds, and rubies,\r\nin the wood, they could not have become her better. She is a splendid\r\nchild! But I know whose brow she has!”\r\n\r\n“Dost thou know, Hester,” said Arthur Dimmesdale, with an unquiet\r\nsmile, “that this dear child, tripping about always at thy side, hath\r\ncaused me many an alarm? Methought—O Hester, what a thought is that,\r\nand how terrible to dread it!—that my own features were partly\r\nrepeated in her face, and so strikingly that the world might see them!\r\nBut she is mostly thine!”\r\n\r\n“No, no! Not mostly!” answered the mother, with a tender smile. “A\r\nlittle longer, and thou needest not to be afraid to trace whose child\r\nshe is. But how strangely beautiful she looks, with those\r\nwild-flowers in her hair! It is as if one of the fairies, whom we left\r\nin our dear old England, had decked her out to meet us.”\r\n\r\nIt was with a feeling which neither of them had ever before\r\nexperienced, that they sat and watched Pearl’s slow advance. In her\r\nwas visible the tie that united them. She had been offered to the\r\nworld, these seven years past, as the living hieroglyphic, in which\r\nwas revealed the secret they so darkly sought to hide,—all written in\r\nthis symbol,—all plainly manifest,—had there been a prophet or\r\nmagician skilled to read the character of flame! And Pearl was the\r\noneness of their being. Be the foregone evil what it might, how could\r\nthey doubt that their earthly lives and future destinies were\r\nconjoined, when they beheld at once the material union, and the\r\nspiritual idea, in whom they met, and were to dwell immortally\r\ntogether? Thoughts like these—and perhaps other thoughts, which they\r\ndid not acknowledge or define—threw an awe about the child, as she\r\ncame onward.\r\n\r\n“Let her see nothing strange—no passion nor eagerness—in thy way of\r\naccosting her,” whispered Hester. “Our Pearl is a fitful and fantastic\r\nlittle elf, sometimes. Especially, she is seldom tolerant of emotion,\r\nwhen she does not fully comprehend the why and wherefore. But the\r\nchild hath strong affections! She loves me, and will love thee!”\r\n\r\n“Thou canst not think,” said the minister, glancing aside at Hester\r\nPrynne, “how my heart dreads this interview, and yearns for it! But,\r\nin truth, as I already told thee, children are not readily won to be\r\nfamiliar with me. They will not climb my knee, nor prattle in my ear,\r\nnor answer to my smile; but stand apart, and eye me strangely. Even\r\nlittle babes, when I take them in my arms, weep bitterly. Yet Pearl,\r\ntwice in her little lifetime, hath been kind to me! The first\r\ntime,—thou knowest it well! The last was when thou ledst her with\r\nthee to the house of yonder stern old Governor.”\r\n\r\n“And thou didst plead so bravely in her behalf and mine!” answered the\r\nmother. “I remember it; and so shall little Pearl. Fear nothing! She\r\nmay be strange and shy at first, but will soon learn to love thee!”\r\n\r\nBy this time Pearl had reached the margin of the brook, and stood on\r\nthe farther side, gazing silently at Hester and the clergyman, who\r\nstill sat together on the mossy tree-trunk, waiting to receive her.\r\nJust where she had paused, the brook chanced to form a pool, so smooth\r\nand quiet that it reflected a perfect image of her little figure, with\r\nall the brilliant picturesqueness of her beauty, in its adornment of\r\nflowers and wreathed foliage, but more refined and spiritualized than\r\nthe reality. This image, so nearly identical with the living Pearl,\r\nseemed to communicate somewhat of its own shadowy and intangible\r\nquality to the child herself. It was strange, the way in which Pearl\r\nstood, looking so steadfastly at them through the dim medium of the\r\nforest-gloom; herself, meanwhile, all glorified with a ray of\r\nsunshine, that was attracted thitherward as by a certain sympathy. In\r\nthe brook beneath stood another child,—another and the same,—with\r\nlikewise its ray of golden light. Hester felt herself, in some\r\nindistinct and tantalizing manner, estranged from Pearl; as if the\r\nchild, in her lonely ramble through the forest, had strayed out of the\r\nsphere in which she and her mother dwelt together, and was now vainly\r\nseeking to return to it.\r\n\r\nThere was both truth and error in the impression; the child and\r\nmother were estranged, but through Hester’s fault, not Pearl’s. Since\r\nthe latter rambled from her side, another inmate had been admitted\r\nwithin the circle of the mother’s feelings, and so modified the aspect\r\nof them all, that Pearl, the returning wanderer, could not find her\r\nwonted place, and hardly knew where she was.\r\n\r\n“I have a strange fancy,” observed the sensitive minister, “that this\r\nbrook is the boundary between two worlds, and that thou canst never\r\nmeet thy Pearl again. Or is she an elfish spirit, who, as the legends\r\nof our childhood taught us, is forbidden to cross a running stream?\r\nPray hasten her; for this delay has already imparted a tremor to my\r\nnerves.”\r\n\r\n“Come, dearest child!” said Hester, encouragingly, and stretching out\r\nboth her arms. “How slow thou art! When hast thou been so sluggish\r\nbefore now? Here is a friend of mine, who must be thy friend also.\r\nThou wilt have twice as much love, henceforward, as thy mother alone\r\ncould give thee! Leap across the brook, and come to us. Thou canst\r\nleap like a young deer!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Child at the Brook-Side]\r\n\r\nPearl, without responding in any manner to these honey-sweet\r\nexpressions, remained on the other side of the brook. Now she fixed\r\nher bright, wild eyes on her mother, now on the minister, and now\r\nincluded them both in the same glance; as if to detect and explain to\r\nherself the relation which they bore to one another. For some\r\nunaccountable reason, as Arthur Dimmesdale felt the child’s eyes upon\r\nhimself, his hand—with that gesture so habitual as to have become\r\ninvoluntary—stole over his heart. At length, assuming a singular air\r\nof authority, Pearl stretched out her hand, with the small forefinger\r\nextended, and pointing evidently towards her mother’s breast. And\r\nbeneath, in the mirror of the brook, there was the flower-girdled and\r\nsunny image of little Pearl, pointing her small forefinger too.\r\n\r\n“Thou strange child, why dost thou not come to me?” exclaimed Hester.\r\n\r\nPearl still pointed with her forefinger; and a frown gathered on her\r\nbrow; the more impressive from the childish, the almost baby-like\r\naspect of the features that conveyed it. As her mother still kept\r\nbeckoning to her, and arraying her face in a holiday suit of\r\nunaccustomed smiles, the child stamped her foot with a yet more\r\nimperious look and gesture. In the brook, again, was the fantastic\r\nbeauty of the image, with its reflected frown, its pointed finger, and\r\nimperious gesture, giving emphasis to the aspect of little Pearl.\r\n\r\n“Hasten, Pearl; or I shall be angry with thee!” cried Hester Prynne,\r\nwho, however inured to such behavior on the elf-child’s part at other\r\nseasons, was naturally anxious for a more seemly deportment now. “Leap\r\nacross the brook, naughty child, and run hither! Else I must come to\r\nthee!”\r\n\r\nBut Pearl, not a whit startled at her mother’s threats, any more than\r\nmollified by her entreaties, now suddenly burst into a fit of passion,\r\ngesticulating violently, and throwing her small figure into the most\r\nextravagant contortions. She accompanied this wild outbreak with\r\npiercing shrieks, which the woods reverberated on all sides; so that,\r\nalone as she was in her childish and unreasonable wrath, it seemed as\r\nif a hidden multitude were lending her their sympathy and\r\nencouragement. Seen in the brook, once more, was the shadowy wrath of\r\nPearl’s image, crowned and girdled with flowers, but stamping its\r\nfoot, wildly gesticulating, and, in the midst of all, still pointing\r\nits small forefinger at Hester’s bosom!\r\n\r\n“I see what ails the child,” whispered Hester to the clergyman, and\r\nturning pale in spite of a strong effort to conceal her trouble and\r\nannoyance. “Children will not abide any, the slightest, change in the\r\naccustomed aspect of things that are daily before their eyes. Pearl\r\nmisses something which she has always seen me wear!”\r\n\r\n“I pray you,” answered the minister, “if thou hast any means of\r\npacifying the child, do it forthwith! Save it were the cankered wrath\r\nof an old witch, like Mistress Hibbins,” added he, attempting to\r\nsmile, “I know nothing that I would not sooner encounter than this\r\npassion in a child. In Pearl’s young beauty, as in the wrinkled witch,\r\nit has a preternatural effect. Pacify her, if thou lovest me!”\r\n\r\nHester turned again towards Pearl, with a crimson blush upon her\r\ncheek, a conscious glance aside at the clergyman, and then a heavy\r\nsigh; while, even before she had time to speak, the blush yielded to a\r\ndeadly pallor.\r\n\r\n“Pearl,” said she, sadly, “look down at thy feet! There!—before\r\nthee!—on the hither side of the brook!”\r\n\r\nThe child turned her eyes to the point indicated; and there lay the\r\nscarlet letter, so close upon the margin of the stream, that the gold\r\nembroidery was reflected in it.\r\n\r\n“Bring it hither!” said Hester.\r\n\r\n“Come thou and take it up!” answered Pearl.\r\n\r\n“Was ever such a child!” observed Hester, aside to the minister. “O, I\r\nhave much to tell thee about her! But, in very truth, she is right as\r\nregards this hateful token. I must bear its torture yet a little\r\nlonger,—only a few days longer,—until we shall have left this\r\nregion, and look back hither as to a land which we have dreamed of.\r\nThe forest cannot hide it! The mid-ocean shall take it from my hand,\r\nand swallow it up forever!”\r\n\r\nWith these words, she advanced to the margin of the brook, took up the\r\nscarlet letter, and fastened it again into her bosom. Hopefully, but a\r\nmoment ago, as Hester had spoken of drowning it in the deep sea, there\r\nwas a sense of inevitable doom upon her, as she thus received back\r\nthis deadly symbol from the hand of fate. She had flung it into\r\ninfinite space!—she had drawn an hour’s free breath!—and here again\r\nwas the scarlet misery, glittering on the old spot! So it ever is,\r\nwhether thus typified or no, that an evil deed invests itself with the\r\ncharacter of doom. Hester next gathered up the heavy tresses of her\r\nhair, and confined them beneath her cap. As if there were a withering\r\nspell in the sad letter, her beauty, the warmth and richness of her\r\nwomanhood, departed, like fading sunshine; and a gray shadow seemed to\r\nfall across her.\r\n\r\nWhen the dreary change was wrought, she extended her hand to Pearl.\r\n\r\n“Dost thou know thy mother now, child?” asked she, reproachfully, but\r\nwith a subdued tone. “Wilt thou come across the brook, and own thy\r\nmother, now that she has her shame upon her,—now that she is sad?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; now I will!” answered the child, bounding across the brook, and\r\nclasping Hester in her arms. “Now thou art my mother indeed! And I am\r\nthy little Pearl!”\r\n\r\nIn a mood of tenderness that was not usual with her, she drew down her\r\nmother’s head, and kissed her brow and both her cheeks. But then—by a\r\nkind of necessity that always impelled this child to alloy whatever\r\ncomfort she might chance to give with a throb of anguish—Pearl put up\r\nher mouth, and kissed the scarlet letter too!\r\n\r\n“That was not kind!” said Hester. “When thou hast shown me a little\r\nlove, thou mockest me!”\r\n\r\n“Why doth the minister sit yonder?” asked Pearl.\r\n\r\n“He waits to welcome thee,” replied her mother. “Come thou, and\r\nentreat his blessing! He loves thee, my little Pearl, and loves thy\r\nmother too. Wilt thou not love him? Come! he longs to greet thee!”\r\n\r\n“Doth he love us?” said Pearl, looking up, with acute intelligence,\r\ninto her mother’s face. “Will he go back with us, hand in hand, we\r\nthree together, into the town?”\r\n\r\n“Not now, dear child,” answered Hester. “But in days to come he will\r\nwalk hand in hand with us. We will have a home and fireside of our\r\nown; and thou shalt sit upon his knee; and he will teach thee many\r\nthings, and love thee dearly. Thou wilt love him; wilt thou not?”\r\n\r\n“And will he always keep his hand over his heart?” inquired Pearl.\r\n\r\n“Foolish child, what a question is that!” exclaimed her mother. “Come\r\nand ask his blessing!”\r\n\r\nBut, whether influenced by the jealousy that seems instinctive with\r\nevery petted child towards a dangerous rival, or from whatever caprice\r\nof her freakish nature, Pearl would show no favor to the clergyman. It\r\nwas only by an exertion of force that her mother brought her up to\r\nhim, hanging back, and manifesting her reluctance by odd grimaces; of\r\nwhich, ever since her babyhood, she had possessed a singular variety,\r\nand could transform her mobile physiognomy into a series of different\r\naspects, with a new mischief in them, each and all. The\r\nminister—painfully embarrassed, but hoping that a kiss might prove a\r\ntalisman to admit him into the child’s kindlier regards—bent forward,\r\nand impressed one on her brow. Hereupon, Pearl broke away from her\r\nmother, and, running to the brook, stooped over it, and bathed her\r\nforehead, until the unwelcome kiss was quite washed off, and diffused\r\nthrough a long lapse of the gliding water. She then remained apart,\r\nsilently watching Hester and the clergyman; while they talked\r\ntogether, and made such arrangements as were suggested by their new\r\nposition, and the purposes soon to be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nAnd now this fateful interview had come to a close. The dell was to be\r\nleft a solitude among its dark, old trees, which, with their\r\nmultitudinous tongues, would whisper long of what had passed there,\r\nand no mortal be the wiser. And the melancholy brook would add this\r\nother tale to the mystery with which its little heart was already\r\noverburdened, and whereof it still kept up a murmuring babble, with\r\nnot a whit more cheerfulness of tone than for ages heretofore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\n [Illustration]"

      "content": "THE MINISTER IN A MAZE.\r\n\nAs the minister departed, in advance of Hester Prynne and little\r\nPearl, he threw a backward glance; half expecting that he should\r\ndiscover only some faintly traced features or outline of the mother\r\nand the child, slowly fading into the twilight of the woods. So great\r\na vicissitude in his life could not at once be received as real. But\r\nthere was Hester, clad in her gray robe, still standing beside the\r\ntree-trunk, which some blast had overthrown a long antiquity ago, and\r\nwhich time had ever since been covering with moss, so that these two\r\nfated ones, with earth’s heaviest burden on them, might there sit down\r\ntogether, and find a single hour’s rest and solace. And there was\r\nPearl, too, lightly dancing from the margin of the brook,—now that\r\nthe intrusive third person was gone,—and taking her old place by her\r\nmother’s side. So the minister had not fallen asleep and dreamed!\r\n\r\nIn order to free his mind from this indistinctness and duplicity of\r\nimpression, which vexed it with a strange disquietude, he recalled and\r\nmore thoroughly defined the plans which Hester and himself had\r\nsketched for their departure. It had been determined between them,\r\nthat the Old World, with its crowds and cities, offered them a more\r\neligible shelter and concealment than the wilds of New England, or all\r\nAmerica, with its alternatives of an Indian wigwam, or the few\r\nsettlements of Europeans, scattered thinly along the seaboard. Not to\r\nspeak of the clergyman’s health, so inadequate to sustain the\r\nhardships of a forest life, his native gifts, his culture, and his\r\nentire development, would secure him a home only in the midst of\r\ncivilization and refinement; the higher the state, the more delicately\r\nadapted to it the man. In furtherance of this choice, it so happened\r\nthat a ship lay in the harbor; one of those questionable cruisers,\r\nfrequent at that day, which, without being absolutely outlaws of the\r\ndeep, yet roamed over its surface with a remarkable irresponsibility\r\nof character. This vessel had recently arrived from the Spanish Main,\r\nand, within three days’ time, would sail for Bristol. Hester\r\nPrynne—whose vocation, as a self-enlisted Sister of Charity, had\r\nbrought her acquainted with the captain and crew—could take upon\r\nherself to secure the passage of two individuals and a child, with all\r\nthe secrecy which circumstances rendered more than desirable.\r\n\r\nThe minister had inquired of Hester, with no little interest, the\r\nprecise time at which the vessel might be expected to depart. It would\r\nprobably be on the fourth day from the present. “That is most\r\nfortunate!” he had then said to himself. Now, why the Reverend Mr.\r\nDimmesdale considered it so very fortunate, we hesitate to reveal.\r\nNevertheless,—to hold nothing back from the reader,—it was because,\r\non the third day from the present, he was to preach the Election\r\nSermon; and, as such an occasion formed an honorable epoch in the life\r\nof a New England clergyman, he could not have chanced upon a more\r\nsuitable mode and time of terminating his professional career. “At\r\nleast, they shall say of me,” thought this exemplary man, “that I\r\nleave no public duty unperformed, nor ill performed!” Sad, indeed,\r\nthat an introspection so profound and acute as this poor minister’s\r\nshould be so miserably deceived! We have had, and may still have,\r\nworse things to tell of him; but none, we apprehend, so pitiably weak;\r\nno evidence, at once so slight and irrefragable, of a subtle disease,\r\nthat had long since begun to eat into the real substance of his\r\ncharacter. No man, for any considerable period, can wear one face to\r\nhimself, and another to the multitude, without finally getting\r\nbewildered as to which may be the true.\r\n\r\nThe excitement of Mr. Dimmesdale’s feelings, as he returned from his\r\ninterview with Hester, lent him unaccustomed physical energy, and\r\nhurried him townward at a rapid pace. The pathway among the woods\r\nseemed wilder, more uncouth with its rude natural obstacles, and less\r\ntrodden by the foot of man, than he remembered it on his outward\r\njourney. But he leaped across the plashy places, thrust himself\r\nthrough the clinging underbrush, climbed the ascent, plunged into the\r\nhollow, and overcame, in short, all the difficulties of the track,\r\nwith an unweariable activity that astonished him. He could not but\r\nrecall how feebly, and with what frequent pauses for breath, he had\r\ntoiled over the same ground, only two days before. As he drew near the\r\ntown, he took an impression of change from the series of familiar\r\nobjects that presented themselves. It seemed not yesterday, not one,\r\nnor two, but many days, or even years ago, since he had quitted them.\r\nThere, indeed, was each former trace of the street, as he remembered\r\nit, and all the peculiarities of the houses, with the due multitude\r\nof gable-peaks, and a weathercock at every point where his memory\r\nsuggested one. Not the less, however, came this importunately\r\nobtrusive sense of change. The same was true as regarded the\r\nacquaintances whom he met, and all the well-known shapes of human\r\nlife, about the little town. They looked neither older nor younger\r\nnow; the beards of the aged were no whiter, nor could the creeping\r\nbabe of yesterday walk on his feet to-day; it was impossible to\r\ndescribe in what respect they differed from the individuals on whom he\r\nhad so recently bestowed a parting glance; and yet the minister’s\r\ndeepest sense seemed to inform him of their mutability. A similar\r\nimpression struck him most remarkably, as he passed under the walls of\r\nhis own church. The edifice had so very strange, and yet so familiar,\r\nan aspect, that Mr. Dimmesdale’s mind vibrated between two ideas;\r\neither that he had seen it only in a dream hitherto, or that he was\r\nmerely dreaming about it now.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon, in the various shapes which it assumed, indicated no\r\nexternal change, but so sudden and important a change in the spectator\r\nof the familiar scene, that the intervening space of a single day had\r\noperated on his consciousness like the lapse of years. The minister’s\r\nown will, and Hester’s will, and the fate that grew between them, had\r\nwrought this transformation. It was the same town as heretofore; but\r\nthe same minister returned not from the forest. He might have said to\r\nthe friends who greeted him,—“I am not the man for whom you take me!\r\nI left him yonder in the forest, withdrawn into a secret dell, by a\r\nmossy tree-trunk, and near a melancholy brook! Go, seek your minister,\r\nand see if his emaciated figure, his thin cheek, his white, heavy,\r\npain-wrinkled brow, be not flung down there, like a cast-off\r\ngarment!” His friends, no doubt, would still have insisted with\r\nhim,—“Thou art thyself the man!”—but the error would have been their\r\nown, not his.\r\n\r\nBefore Mr. Dimmesdale reached home, his inner man gave him other\r\nevidences of a revolution in the sphere of thought and feeling. In\r\ntruth, nothing short of a total change of dynasty and moral code, in\r\nthat interior kingdom, was adequate to account for the impulses now\r\ncommunicated to the unfortunate and startled minister. At every step\r\nhe was incited to do some strange, wild, wicked thing or other, with a\r\nsense that it would be at once involuntary and intentional; in spite\r\nof himself, yet growing out of a profounder self than that which\r\nopposed the impulse. For instance, he met one of his own deacons. The\r\ngood old man addressed him with the paternal affection and patriarchal\r\nprivilege, which his venerable age, his upright and holy character,\r\nand his station in the Church, entitled him to use; and, conjoined\r\nwith this, the deep, almost worshipping respect, which the minister’s\r\nprofessional and private claims alike demanded. Never was there a more\r\nbeautiful example of how the majesty of age and wisdom may comport\r\nwith the obeisance and respect enjoined upon it, as from a lower\r\nsocial rank, and inferior order of endowment, towards a higher. Now,\r\nduring a conversation of some two or three moments between the\r\nReverend Mr. Dimmesdale and this excellent and hoary-bearded deacon,\r\nit was only by the most careful self-control that the former could\r\nrefrain from uttering certain blasphemous suggestions that rose into\r\nhis mind, respecting the communion supper. He absolutely trembled and\r\nturned pale as ashes, lest his tongue should wag itself, in utterance\r\nof these horrible matters, and plead his own consent for so doing,\r\nwithout his having fairly given it. And, even with this terror in his\r\nheart, he could hardly avoid laughing, to imagine how the sanctified\r\nold patriarchal deacon would have been petrified by his minister’s\r\nimpiety!\r\n\r\nAgain, another incident of the same nature. Hurrying along the street,\r\nthe Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale encountered the eldest female member of\r\nhis church; a most pious and exemplary old dame; poor, widowed,\r\nlonely, and with a heart as full of reminiscences about her dead\r\nhusband and children, and her dead friends of long ago, as a\r\nburial-ground is full of storied gravestones. Yet all this, which\r\nwould else have been such heavy sorrow, was made almost a solemn joy\r\nto her devout old soul, by religious consolations and the truths of\r\nScripture, wherewith she had fed herself continually for more than\r\nthirty years. And, since Mr. Dimmesdale had taken her in charge, the\r\ngood grandam’s chief earthly comfort—which, unless it had been\r\nlikewise a heavenly comfort, could have been none at all—was to meet\r\nher pastor, whether casually, or of set purpose, and be refreshed with\r\na word of warm, fragrant, heaven-breathing Gospel truth, from his\r\nbeloved lips, into her dulled, but rapturously attentive ear. But, on\r\nthis occasion, up to the moment of putting his lips to the old woman’s\r\near, Mr. Dimmesdale, as the great enemy of souls would have it, could\r\nrecall no text of Scripture, nor aught else, except a brief, pithy,\r\nand, as it then appeared to him, unanswerable argument against the\r\nimmortality of the human soul. The instilment thereof into her mind\r\nwould probably have caused this aged sister to drop down dead, at\r\nonce, as by the effect of an intensely poisonous infusion. What he\r\nreally did whisper, the minister could never afterwards recollect.\r\nThere was, perhaps, a fortunate disorder in his utterance, which\r\nfailed to impart any distinct idea to the good widow’s comprehension,\r\nor which Providence interpreted after a method of its own. Assuredly,\r\nas the minister looked back, he beheld an expression of divine\r\ngratitude and ecstasy that seemed like the shine of the celestial city\r\non her face, so wrinkled and ashy pale.\r\n\r\nAgain, a third instance. After parting from the old church-member, he\r\nmet the youngest sister of them all. It was a maiden newly won—and\r\nwon by the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale’s own sermon, on the Sabbath after\r\nhis vigil—to barter the transitory pleasures of the world for the\r\nheavenly hope, that was to assume brighter substance as life grew dark\r\naround her, and which would gild the utter gloom with final glory. She\r\nwas fair and pure as a lily that had bloomed in Paradise. The minister\r\nknew well that he was himself enshrined within the stainless sanctity\r\nof her heart, which hung its snowy curtains about his image, imparting\r\nto religion the warmth of love, and to love a religious purity. Satan,\r\nthat afternoon, had surely led the poor young girl away from her\r\nmother’s side, and thrown her into the pathway of this sorely tempted,\r\nor—shall we not rather say?—this lost and desperate man. As she drew\r\nnigh, the arch-fiend whispered him to condense into small compass and\r\ndrop into her tender bosom a germ of evil that would be sure to\r\nblossom darkly soon, and bear black fruit betimes. Such was his sense\r\nof power over this virgin soul, trusting him as she did, that the\r\nminister felt potent to blight all the field of innocence with but one\r\nwicked look, and develop all its opposite with but a word. So—with a\r\nmightier struggle than he had yet sustained—he held his Geneva cloak\r\nbefore his face, and hurried onward, making no sign of recognition,\r\nand leaving the young sister to digest his rudeness as she might. She\r\nransacked her conscience,—which was full of harmless little matters,\r\nlike her pocket or her work-bag,—and took herself to task, poor\r\nthing! for a thousand imaginary faults; and went about her household\r\nduties with swollen eyelids the next morning.\r\n\r\nBefore the minister had time to celebrate his victory over this last\r\ntemptation, he was conscious of another impulse, more ludicrous, and\r\nalmost as horrible. It was,—we blush to tell it,—it was to stop\r\nshort in the road, and teach some very wicked words to a knot of\r\nlittle Puritan children who were playing there, and had but just begun\r\nto talk. Denying himself this freak, as unworthy of his cloth, he met\r\na drunken seaman, one of the ship’s crew from the Spanish Main. And,\r\nhere, since he had so valiantly forborne all other wickedness, poor\r\nMr. Dimmesdale longed, at least, to shake hands with the tarry\r\nblackguard, and recreate himself with a few improper jests, such as\r\ndissolute sailors so abound with, and a volley of good, round, solid,\r\nsatisfactory, and heaven-defying oaths! It was not so much a better\r\nprinciple as partly his natural good taste, and still more his\r\nbuckramed habit of clerical decorum, that carried him safely through\r\nthe latter crisis.\r\n\r\n“What is it that haunts and tempts me thus?” cried the minister to\r\nhimself, at length, pausing in the street, and striking his hand\r\nagainst his forehead. “Am I mad? or am I given over utterly to the\r\nfiend? Did I make a contract with him in the forest, and sign it with\r\nmy blood? And does he now summon me to its fulfilment, by suggesting\r\nthe performance of every wickedness which his most foul imagination\r\ncan conceive?”\r\n\r\nAt the moment when the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale thus communed with\r\nhimself, and struck his forehead with his hand, old Mistress Hibbins,\r\nthe reputed witch-lady, is said to have been passing by. She made a\r\nvery grand appearance; having on a high head-dress, a rich gown of\r\nvelvet, and a ruff done up with the famous yellow starch, of which Ann\r\nTurner, her especial friend, had taught her the secret, before this\r\nlast good lady had been hanged for Sir Thomas Overbury’s murder.\r\nWhether the witch had read the minister’s thoughts, or no, she came to\r\na full stop, looked shrewdly into his face, smiled craftily,\r\nand—though little given to converse with clergymen—began a\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n“So, reverend Sir, you have made a visit into the forest,” observed\r\nthe witch-lady, nodding her high head-dress at him. “The next time, I\r\npray you to allow me only a fair warning, and I shall be proud to bear\r\nyou company. Without taking overmuch upon myself, my good word will go\r\nfar towards gaining any strange gentleman a fair reception from yonder\r\npotentate you wot of!”\r\n\r\n“I profess, madam,” answered the clergyman, with a grave obeisance,\r\nsuch as the lady’s rank demanded, and his own good-breeding made\r\nimperative,—“I profess, on my conscience and character, that I am\r\nutterly bewildered as touching the purport of your words! I went not\r\ninto the forest to seek a potentate; neither do I, at any future time,\r\ndesign a visit thither, with a view to gaining the favor of such a\r\npersonage. My one sufficient object was to greet that pious friend of\r\nmine, the Apostle Eliot, and rejoice with him over the many precious\r\nsouls he hath won from heathendom!”\r\n\r\n“Ha, ha, ha!” cackled the old witch-lady, still nodding her high\r\nhead-dress at the minister. “Well, well, we must needs talk thus in\r\nthe daytime! You carry it off like an old hand! But at midnight, and\r\nin the forest, we shall have other talk together!”\r\n\r\nShe passed on with her aged stateliness, but often turning back her\r\nhead and smiling at him, like one willing to recognize a secret\r\nintimacy of connection.\r\n\r\n“Have I then sold myself,” thought the minister, “to the fiend whom,\r\nif men say true, this yellow-starched and velveted old hag has chosen\r\nfor her prince and master!”\r\n\r\nThe wretched minister! He had made a bargain very like it! Tempted by\r\na dream of happiness, he had yielded himself, with deliberate choice,\r\nas he had never done before, to what he knew was deadly sin. And the\r\ninfectious poison of that sin had been thus rapidly diffused\r\nthroughout his moral system. It had stupefied all blessed impulses,\r\nand awakened into vivid life the whole brotherhood of bad ones. Scorn,\r\nbitterness, unprovoked malignity, gratuitous desire of ill, ridicule\r\nof whatever was good and holy, all awoke, to tempt, even while they\r\nfrightened him. And his encounter with old Mistress Hibbins, if it\r\nwere a real incident, did but show his sympathy and fellowship with\r\nwicked mortals, and the world of perverted spirits.\r\n\r\nHe had, by this time, reached his dwelling, on the edge of the\r\nburial-ground, and, hastening up the stairs, took refuge in his study.\r\nThe minister was glad to have reached this shelter, without first\r\nbetraying himself to the world by any of those strange and wicked\r\neccentricities to which he had been continually impelled while passing\r\nthrough the streets. He entered the accustomed room, and looked around\r\nhim on its books, its windows, its fireplace, and the tapestried\r\ncomfort of the walls, with the same perception of strangeness that had\r\nhaunted him throughout his walk from the forest-dell into the town,\r\nand thitherward. Here he had studied and written; here, gone through\r\nfast and vigil, and come forth half alive; here, striven to pray;\r\nhere, borne a hundred thousand agonies! There was the Bible, in its\r\nrich old Hebrew, with Moses and the Prophets speaking to him, and\r\nGod’s voice through all! There, on the table, with the inky pen beside\r\nit, was an unfinished sermon, with a sentence broken in the midst,\r\nwhere his thoughts had ceased to gush out upon the page, two days\r\nbefore. He knew that it was himself, the thin and white-cheeked\r\nminister, who had done and suffered these things, and written thus far\r\ninto the Election Sermon! But he seemed to stand apart, and eye this\r\nformer self with scornful, pitying, but half-envious curiosity. That\r\nself was gone. Another man had returned out of the forest; a wiser\r\none; with a knowledge of hidden mysteries which the simplicity of the\r\nformer never could have reached. A bitter kind of knowledge that!\r\n\r\nWhile occupied with these reflections, a knock came at the door of the\r\nstudy, and the minister said, “Come in!”—not wholly devoid of an idea\r\nthat he might behold an evil spirit. And so he did! It was old Roger\r\nChillingworth that entered. The minister stood, white and speechless,\r\nwith one hand on the Hebrew Scriptures, and the other spread upon his\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\n“Welcome home, reverend Sir,” said the physician. “And how found you\r\nthat godly man, the Apostle Eliot? But methinks, dear Sir, you look\r\npale; as if the travel through the wilderness had been too sore for\r\nyou. Will not my aid be requisite to put you in heart and strength to\r\npreach your Election Sermon?”\r\n\r\n“Nay, I think not so,” rejoined the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale. “My\r\njourney, and the sight of the holy Apostle yonder, and the free air\r\nwhich I have breathed, have done me good, after so long confinement in\r\nmy study. I think to need no more of your drugs, my kind physician,\r\ngood though they be, and administered by a friendly hand.”\r\n\r\nAll this time, Roger Chillingworth was looking at the minister with\r\nthe grave and intent regard of a physician towards his patient. But,\r\nin spite of this outward show, the latter was almost convinced of the\r\nold man’s knowledge, or, at least, his confident suspicion, with\r\nrespect to his own interview with Hester Prynne. The physician knew\r\nthen, that, in the minister’s regard, he was no longer a trusted\r\nfriend, but his bitterest enemy. So much being known, it would appear\r\nnatural that a part of it should be expressed. It is singular,\r\nhowever, how long a time often passes before words embody things; and\r\nwith what security two persons, who choose to avoid a certain subject,\r\nmay approach its very verge, and retire without disturbing it. Thus,\r\nthe minister felt no apprehension that Roger Chillingworth would\r\ntouch, in express words, upon the real position which they sustained\r\ntowards one another. Yet did the physician, in his dark way, creep\r\nfrightfully near the secret.\r\n\r\n“Were it not better,” said he, “that you use my poor skill to-night?\r\nVerily, dear Sir, we must take pains to make you strong and vigorous\r\nfor this occasion of the Election discourse. The people look for great\r\nthings from you; apprehending that another year may come about, and\r\nfind their pastor gone.”\r\n\r\n“Yea, to another world,” replied the minister, with pious resignation.\r\n“Heaven grant it be a better one; for, in good sooth, I hardly think\r\nto tarry with my flock through the flitting seasons of another year!\r\nBut, touching your medicine, kind Sir, in my present frame of body, I\r\nneed it not.”\r\n\r\n“I joy to hear it,” answered the physician. “It may be that my\r\nremedies, so long administered in vain, begin now to take due effect.\r\nHappy man were I, and well deserving of New England’s gratitude, could\r\nI achieve this cure!”\r\n\r\n“I thank you from my heart, most watchful friend,” said the Reverend\r\nMr. Dimmesdale, with a solemn smile. “I thank you, and can but requite\r\nyour good deeds with my prayers.”\r\n\r\n“A good man’s prayers are golden recompense!” rejoined old Roger\r\nChillingworth, as he took his leave. “Yea, they are the current gold\r\ncoin of the New Jerusalem, with the King’s own mint-mark on them!”\r\n\r\nLeft alone, the minister summoned a servant of the house, and\r\nrequested food, which, being set before him, he ate with ravenous\r\nappetite. Then, flinging the already written pages of the Election\r\nSermon into the fire, he forthwith began another, which he wrote with\r\nsuch an impulsive flow of thought and emotion, that he fancied himself\r\ninspired; and only wondered that Heaven should see fit to transmit the\r\ngrand and solemn music of its oracles through so foul an organ-pipe as\r\nhe. However, leaving that mystery to solve itself, or go unsolved\r\nforever, he drove his task onward, with earnest haste and ecstasy.\r\nThus the night fled away, as if it were a winged steed, and he\r\ncareering on it; morning came, and peeped, blushing, through the\r\ncurtains; and at last sunrise threw a golden beam into the study and\r\nlaid it right across the minister’s bedazzled eyes. There he was, with\r\nthe pen still between his fingers, and a vast, immeasurable tract of\r\nwritten space behind him!\r\n\n [Illustration]"

      "content": "THE NEW ENGLAND HOLIDAY.\r\n\nBetimes in the morning of the day on which the new Governor was to\r\nreceive his office at the hands of the people, Hester Prynne and\r\nlittle Pearl came into the market-place. It was already thronged with\r\nthe craftsmen and other plebeian inhabitants of the town, in\r\nconsiderable numbers; among whom, likewise, were many rough figures,\r\nwhose attire of deer-skins marked them as belonging to some of the\r\nforest settlements, which surrounded the little metropolis of the\r\ncolony.\r\n\r\nOn this public holiday, as on all other occasions, for seven years\r\npast, Hester was clad in a garment of coarse gray cloth. Not more by\r\nits hue than by some indescribable peculiarity in its fashion, it had\r\nthe effect of making her fade personally out of sight and outline;\r\nwhile, again, the scarlet letter brought her back from this twilight\r\nindistinctness, and revealed her under the moral aspect of its own\r\nillumination. Her face, so long familiar to the towns-people, showed\r\nthe marble quietude which they were accustomed to behold there. It was\r\nlike a mask; or, rather, like the frozen calmness of a dead woman’s\r\nfeatures; owing this dreary resemblance to the fact that Hester was\r\nactually dead, in respect to any claim of sympathy, and had departed\r\nout of the world with which she still seemed to mingle.\r\n\r\nIt might be, on this one day, that there was an expression unseen\r\nbefore, nor, indeed, vivid enough to be detected now; unless some\r\npreternaturally gifted observer should have first read the heart, and\r\nhave afterwards sought a corresponding development in the countenance\r\nand mien. Such a spiritual seer might have conceived, that, after\r\nsustaining the gaze of the multitude through seven miserable years as\r\na necessity, a penance, and something which it was a stern religion to\r\nendure, she now, for one last time more, encountered it freely and\r\nvoluntarily, in order to convert what had so long been agony into a\r\nkind of triumph. “Look your last on the scarlet letter and its\r\nwearer!”—the people’s victim and life-long bond-slave, as they\r\nfancied her, might say to them. “Yet a little while, and she will be\r\nbeyond your reach! A few hours longer, and the deep, mysterious ocean\r\nwill quench and hide forever the symbol which ye have caused to burn\r\nupon her bosom!” Nor were it an inconsistency too improbable to be\r\nassigned to human nature, should we suppose a feeling of regret in\r\nHester’s mind, at the moment when she was about to win her freedom\r\nfrom the pain which had been thus deeply incorporated with her being.\r\nMight there not be an irresistible desire to quaff a last, long,\r\nbreathless draught of the cup of wormwood and aloes, with which nearly\r\nall her years of womanhood had been perpetually flavored? The wine of\r\nlife, henceforth to be presented to her lips, must be indeed rich,\r\ndelicious, and exhilarating, in its chased and golden beaker; or else\r\nleave an inevitable and weary languor, after the lees of bitterness\r\nwherewith she had been drugged, as with a cordial of intensest\r\npotency.\r\n\r\nPearl was decked out with airy gayety. It would have been impossible\r\nto guess that this bright and sunny apparition owed its existence to\r\nthe shape of gloomy gray; or that a fancy, at once so gorgeous and so\r\ndelicate as must have been requisite to contrive the child’s apparel,\r\nwas the same that had achieved a task perhaps more difficult, in\r\nimparting so distinct a peculiarity to Hester’s simple robe. The\r\ndress, so proper was it to little Pearl, seemed an effluence, or\r\ninevitable development and outward manifestation of her character, no\r\nmore to be separated from her than the many-hued brilliancy from a\r\nbutterfly’s wing, or the painted glory from the leaf of a bright\r\nflower. As with these, so with the child; her garb was all of one idea\r\nwith her nature. On this eventful day, moreover, there was a certain\r\nsingular inquietude and excitement in her mood, resembling nothing so\r\nmuch as the shimmer of a diamond, that sparkles and flashes with the\r\nvaried throbbings of the breast on which it is displayed. Children\r\nhave always a sympathy in the agitations of those connected with them;\r\nalways, especially, a sense of any trouble or impending revolution, of\r\nwhatever kind, in domestic circumstances; and therefore Pearl, who was\r\nthe gem on her mother’s unquiet bosom, betrayed, by the very dance of\r\nher spirits, the emotions which none could detect in the marble\r\npassiveness of Hester’s brow.\r\n\r\nThis effervescence made her flit with a bird-like movement, rather\r\nthan walk by her mother’s side. She broke continually into shouts of a\r\nwild, inarticulate, and sometimes piercing music. When they reached\r\nthe market-place, she became still more restless, on perceiving the\r\nstir and bustle that enlivened the spot; for it was usually more like\r\nthe broad and lonesome green before a village meeting-house, than the\r\ncentre of a town’s business.\r\n\r\n“Why, what is this, mother?” cried she. “Wherefore have all the people\r\nleft their work to-day? Is it a play-day for the whole world? See,\r\nthere is the blacksmith! He has washed his sooty face, and put on his\r\nSabbath-day clothes, and looks as if he would gladly be merry, if any\r\nkind body would only teach him how! And there is Master Brackett, the\r\nold jailer, nodding and smiling at me. Why does he do so, mother?”\r\n\r\n“He remembers thee a little babe, my child,” answered Hester.\r\n\r\n“He should not nod and smile at me, for all that,—the black, grim,\r\nugly-eyed old man!” said Pearl. “He may nod at thee, if he will; for\r\nthou art clad in gray, and wearest the scarlet letter. But see,\r\nmother, how many faces of strange people, and Indians among them, and\r\nsailors! What have they all come to do, here in the market-place?”\r\n\r\n“They wait to see the procession pass,” said Hester. “For the Governor\r\nand the magistrates are to go by, and the ministers, and all the great\r\npeople and good people, with the music and the soldiers marching\r\nbefore them.”\r\n\r\n“And will the minister be there?” asked Pearl. “And will he hold out\r\nboth his hands to me, as when thou ledst me to him from the\r\nbrook-side?”\r\n\r\n“He will be there, child,” answered her mother. “But he will not greet\r\nthee to-day; nor must thou greet him.”\r\n\r\n“What a strange, sad man is he!” said the child, as if speaking partly\r\nto herself. “In the dark night-time he calls us to him, and holds thy\r\nhand and mine, as when we stood with him on the scaffold yonder. And\r\nin the deep forest, where only the old trees can hear, and the strip\r\nof sky see it, he talks with thee, sitting on a heap of moss! And he\r\nkisses my forehead, too, so that the little brook would hardly wash it\r\noff! But here, in the sunny day, and among all the people, he knows us\r\nnot; nor must we know him! A strange, sad man is he, with his hand\r\nalways over his heart!”\r\n\r\n“Be quiet, Pearl! Thou understandest not these things,” said her\r\nmother. “Think not now of the minister, but look about thee, and see\r\nhow cheery is everybody’s face to-day. The children have come from\r\ntheir schools, and the grown people from their workshops and their\r\nfields, on purpose to be happy. For, to-day, a new man is beginning to\r\nrule over them; and so—as has been the custom of mankind ever since a\r\nnation was first gathered—they make merry and rejoice; as if a good\r\nand golden year were at length to pass over the poor old world!”\r\n\r\nIt was as Hester said, in regard to the unwonted jollity that\r\nbrightened the faces of the people. Into this festal season of the\r\nyear—as it already was, and continued to be during the greater part\r\nof two centuries—the Puritans compressed whatever mirth and public\r\njoy they deemed allowable to human infirmity; thereby so far\r\ndispelling the customary cloud, that, for the space of a single\r\nholiday, they appeared scarcely more grave than most other communities\r\nat a period of general affliction.\r\n\r\nBut we perhaps exaggerate the gray or sable tinge, which undoubtedly\r\ncharacterized the mood and manners of the age. The persons now in the\r\nmarket-place of Boston had not been born to an inheritance of\r\nPuritanic gloom. They were native Englishmen, whose fathers had lived\r\nin the sunny richness of the Elizabethan epoch; a time when the life\r\nof England, viewed as one great mass, would appear to have been as\r\nstately, magnificent, and joyous, as the world has ever witnessed. Had\r\nthey followed their hereditary taste, the New England settlers would\r\nhave illustrated all events of public importance by bonfires,\r\nbanquets, pageantries, and processions. Nor would it have been\r\nimpracticable, in the observance of majestic ceremonies, to combine\r\nmirthful recreation with solemnity, and give, as it were, a grotesque\r\nand brilliant embroidery to the great robe of state, which a nation,\r\nat such festivals, puts on. There was some shadow of an attempt of\r\nthis kind in the mode of celebrating the day on which the political\r\nyear of the colony commenced. The dim reflection of a remembered\r\nsplendor, a colorless and manifold diluted repetition of what they had\r\nbeheld in proud old London,—we will not say at a royal coronation,\r\nbut at a Lord Mayor’s show,—might be traced in the customs which our\r\nforefathers instituted, with reference to the annual installation of\r\nmagistrates. The fathers and founders of the commonwealth—the\r\nstatesman, the priest, and the soldier—deemed it a duty then to\r\nassume the outward state and majesty, which, in accordance with\r\nantique style, was looked upon as the proper garb of public or social\r\neminence. All came forth, to move in procession before the people’s\r\neye, and thus impart a needed dignity to the simple framework of a\r\ngovernment so newly constructed.\r\n\r\nThen, too, the people were countenanced, if not encouraged, in\r\nrelaxing the severe and close application to their various modes of\r\nrugged industry, which, at all other times, seemed of the same piece\r\nand material with their religion. Here, it is true, were none of the\r\napplicances which popular merriment would so readily have found in the\r\nEngland of Elizabeth’s time, or that of James;—no rude shows of a\r\ntheatrical kind; no minstrel, with his harp and legendary ballad, nor\r\ngleeman, with an ape dancing to his music; no juggler, with his tricks\r\nof mimic witchcraft; no Merry Andrew, to stir up the multitude with\r\njests, perhaps hundreds of years old, but still effective, by their\r\nappeals to the very broadest sources of mirthful sympathy. All such\r\nprofessors of the several branches of jocularity would have been\r\nsternly repressed, not only by the rigid discipline of law, but by the\r\ngeneral sentiment which gives law its vitality. Not the less, however,\r\nthe great, honest face of the people smiled, grimly, perhaps, but\r\nwidely too. Nor were sports wanting, such as the colonists had\r\nwitnessed, and shared in, long ago, at the country fairs and on the\r\nvillage-greens of England; and which it was thought well to keep alive\r\non this new soil, for the sake of the courage and manliness that were\r\nessential in them. Wrestling-matches, in the different fashions of\r\nCornwall and Devonshire, were seen here and there about the\r\nmarket-place; in one corner, there was a friendly bout at\r\nquarterstaff; and—what attracted most interest of all—on the\r\nplatform of the pillory, already so noted in our pages, two masters of\r\ndefence were commencing an exhibition with the buckler and broadsword.\r\nBut, much to the disappointment of the crowd, this latter business was\r\nbroken off by the interposition of the town beadle, who had no idea of\r\npermitting the majesty of the law to be violated by such an abuse of\r\none of its consecrated places.\r\n\r\nIt may not be too much to affirm, on the whole, (the people being then\r\nin the first stages of joyless deportment, and the offspring of sires\r\nwho had known how to be merry, in their day,) that they would compare\r\nfavorably, in point of holiday keeping, with their descendants, even\r\nat so long an interval as ourselves. Their immediate posterity, the\r\ngeneration next to the early emigrants, wore the blackest shade of\r\nPuritanism, and so darkened the national visage with it, that all the\r\nsubsequent years have not sufficed to clear it up. We have yet to\r\nlearn again the forgotten art of gayety.\r\n\r\nThe picture of human life in the market-place, though its general tint\r\nwas the sad gray, brown, or black of the English emigrants, was yet\r\nenlivened by some diversity of hue. A party of Indians—in their\r\nsavage finery of curiously embroidered deer-skin robes, wampum-belts,\r\nred and yellow ochre, and feathers, and armed with the bow and arrow\r\nand stone-headed spear—stood apart, with countenances of inflexible\r\ngravity, beyond what even the Puritan aspect could attain. Nor, wild\r\nas were these painted barbarians, were they the wildest feature of the\r\nscene. This distinction could more justly be claimed by some\r\nmariners,—a part of the crew of the vessel from the Spanish\r\nMain,—who had come ashore to see the humors of Election Day. They\r\nwere rough-looking desperadoes, with sun-blackened faces, and an\r\nimmensity of beard; their wide, short trousers were confined about the\r\nwaist by belts, often clasped with a rough plate of gold, and\r\nsustaining always a long knife, and, in some instances, a sword. From\r\nbeneath their broad-brimmed hats of palm-leaf gleamed eyes which, even\r\nin good-nature and merriment, had a kind of animal ferocity. They\r\ntransgressed, without fear or scruple, the rules of behavior that were\r\nbinding on all others; smoking tobacco under the beadle’s very nose,\r\nalthough each whiff would have cost a townsman a shilling; and\r\nquaffing, at their pleasure, draughts of wine or aqua-vitæ from\r\npocket-flasks, which they freely tendered to the gaping crowd around\r\nthem. It remarkably characterized the incomplete morality of the age,\r\nrigid as we call it, that a license was allowed the seafaring class,\r\nnot merely for their freaks on shore, but for far more desperate deeds\r\non their proper element. The sailor of that day would go near to be\r\narraigned as a pirate in our own. There could be little doubt, for\r\ninstance, that this very ship’s crew, though no unfavorable specimens\r\nof the nautical brotherhood, had been guilty, as we should phrase it,\r\nof depredations on the Spanish commerce, such as would have perilled\r\nall their necks in a modern court of justice.\r\n\r\nBut the sea, in those old times, heaved, swelled, and foamed, very\r\nmuch at its own will, or subject only to the tempestuous wind, with\r\nhardly any attempts at regulation by human law. The buccaneer on the\r\nwave might relinquish his calling, and become at once, if he chose, a\r\nman of probity and piety on land; nor, even in the full career of his\r\nreckless life, was he regarded as a personage with whom it was\r\ndisreputable to traffic, or casually associate. Thus, the Puritan\r\nelders, in their black cloaks, starched bands, and steeple-crowned\r\nhats, smiled not unbenignantly at the clamor and rude deportment of\r\nthese jolly seafaring men; and it excited neither surprise nor\r\nanimadversion, when so reputable a citizen as old Roger Chillingworth,\r\nthe physician, was seen to enter the market-place, in close and\r\nfamiliar talk with the commander of the questionable vessel.\r\n\r\nThe latter was by far the most showy and gallant figure, so far as\r\napparel went, anywhere to be seen among the multitude. He wore a\r\nprofusion of ribbons on his garment, and gold-lace on his hat, which\r\nwas also encircled by a gold chain, and surmounted with a feather.\r\nThere was a sword at his side, and a sword-cut on his forehead, which,\r\nby the arrangement of his hair, he seemed anxious rather to display\r\nthan hide. A landsman could hardly have worn this garb and shown this\r\nface, and worn and shown them both with such a galliard air, without\r\nundergoing stern question before a magistrate, and probably incurring\r\nfine or imprisonment, or perhaps an exhibition in the stocks. As\r\nregarded the shipmaster, however, all was looked upon as pertaining to\r\nthe character, as to a fish his glistening scales.\r\n\r\nAfter parting from the physician, the commander of the Bristol ship\r\nstrolled idly through the market-place; until, happening to approach\r\nthe spot where Hester Prynne was standing, he appeared to recognize,\r\nand did not hesitate to address her. As was usually the case wherever\r\nHester stood, a small vacant area—a sort of magic circle—had formed\r\nitself about her, into which, though the people were elbowing one\r\nanother at a little distance, none ventured, or felt disposed to\r\nintrude. It was a forcible type of the moral solitude in which the\r\nscarlet letter enveloped its fated wearer; partly by her own reserve,\r\nand partly by the instinctive, though no longer so unkindly,\r\nwithdrawal of her fellow-creatures. Now, if never before, it answered\r\na good purpose, by enabling Hester and the seaman to speak together\r\nwithout risk of being overheard; and so changed was Hester Prynne’s\r\nrepute before the public, that the matron in town most eminent for\r\nrigid morality could not have held such intercourse with less result\r\nof scandal than herself.\r\n\r\n“So, mistress,” said the mariner, “I must bid the steward make ready\r\none more berth than you bargained for! No fear of scurvy or\r\nship-fever, this voyage! What with the ship’s surgeon and this other\r\ndoctor, our only danger will be from drug or pill; more by token, as\r\nthere is a lot of apothecary’s stuff aboard, which I traded for with a\r\nSpanish vessel.”\r\n\r\n“What mean you?” inquired Hester, startled more than she permitted to\r\nappear. “Have you another passenger?”\r\n\r\n“Why, know you not,” cried the shipmaster, “that this physician\r\nhere—Chillingworth, he calls himself—is minded to try my cabin-fare\r\nwith you? Ay, ay, you must have known it; for he tells me he is of\r\nyour party, and a close friend to the gentleman you spoke of,—he that\r\nis in peril from these sour old Puritan rulers!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chillingworth,—“Smile with a sinister meaning”]\r\n\r\n“They know each other well, indeed,” replied Hester, with a mien of\r\ncalmness, though in the utmost consternation. “They have long dwelt\r\ntogether.”\r\n\r\nNothing further passed between the mariner and Hester Prynne. But, at\r\nthat instant, she beheld old Roger Chillingworth himself, standing in\r\nthe remotest corner of the market-place, and smiling on her; a smile\r\nwhich—across the wide and bustling square, and through all the talk\r\nand laughter, and various thoughts, moods, and interests of the\r\ncrowd—conveyed secret and fearful meaning.\r\n\n [Illustration]"

      "content": "THE PROCESSION.\r\n\nBefore Hester Prynne could call together her thoughts, and consider\r\nwhat was practicable to be done in this new and startling aspect of\r\naffairs, the sound of military music was heard approaching along a\r\ncontiguous street. It denoted the advance of the procession of\r\nmagistrates and citizens, on its way towards the meeting-house; where,\r\nin compliance with a custom thus early established, and ever since\r\nobserved, the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale was to deliver an Election\r\nSermon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: New England Worthies]\r\n\r\nSoon the head of the procession showed itself, with a slow and stately\r\nmarch, turning a corner, and making its way across the market-place.\r\nFirst came the music. It comprised a variety of instruments, perhaps\r\nimperfectly adapted to one another, and played with no great skill;\r\nbut yet attaining the great object for which the harmony of drum and\r\nclarion addresses itself to the multitude,—that of imparting a higher\r\nand more heroic air to the scene of life that passes before the eye.\r\nLittle Pearl at first clapped her hands, but then lost, for an\r\ninstant, the restless agitation that had kept her in a continual\r\neffervescence throughout the morning; she gazed silently, and seemed\r\nto be borne upward, like a floating sea-bird, on the long heaves and\r\nswells of sound. But she was brought back to her former mood by the\r\nshimmer of the sunshine on the weapons and bright armor of the\r\nmilitary company, which followed after the music, and formed the\r\nhonorary escort of the procession. This body of soldiery—which still\r\nsustains a corporate existence, and marches down from past ages with\r\nan ancient and honorable fame—was composed of no mercenary materials.\r\nIts ranks were filled with gentlemen, who felt the stirrings of\r\nmartial impulse, and sought to establish a kind of College of Arms,\r\nwhere, as in an association of Knights Templars, they might learn the\r\nscience, and, so far as peaceful exercise would teach them, the\r\npractices of war. The high estimation then placed upon the military\r\ncharacter might be seen in the lofty port of each individual member\r\nof the company. Some of them, indeed, by their services in the Low\r\nCountries and on other fields of European warfare, had fairly won\r\ntheir title to assume the name and pomp of soldiership. The entire\r\narray, moreover, clad in burnished steel, and with plumage nodding\r\nover their bright morions, had a brilliancy of effect which no modern\r\ndisplay can aspire to equal.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the men of civil eminence, who came immediately behind the\r\nmilitary escort, were better worth a thoughtful observer’s eye. Even\r\nin outward demeanor, they showed a stamp of majesty that made the\r\nwarrior’s haughty stride look vulgar, if not absurd. It was an age\r\nwhen what we call talent had far less consideration than now, but the\r\nmassive materials which produce stability and dignity of character a\r\ngreat deal more. The people possessed, by hereditary right, the\r\nquality of reverence; which, in their descendants, if it survive at\r\nall, exists in smaller proportion, and with a vastly diminished force,\r\nin the selection and estimate of public men. The change may be for\r\ngood or ill, and is partly, perhaps, for both. In that old day, the\r\nEnglish settler on these rude shores—having left king, nobles, and\r\nall degrees of awful rank behind, while still the faculty and\r\nnecessity of reverence were strong in him—bestowed it on the white\r\nhair and venerable brow of age; on long-tried integrity; on solid\r\nwisdom and sad-colored experience; on endowments of that grave and\r\nweighty order which gives the idea of permanence, and comes under the\r\ngeneral definition of respectability. These primitive statesmen,\r\ntherefore,—Bradstreet, Endicott, Dudley, Bellingham, and their\r\ncompeers,—who were elevated to power by the early choice of the\r\npeople, seem to have been not often brilliant, but distinguished by a\r\nponderous sobriety, rather than activity of intellect. They had\r\nfortitude and self-reliance, and, in time of difficulty or peril,\r\nstood up for the welfare of the state like a line of cliffs against a\r\ntempestuous tide. The traits of character here indicated were well\r\nrepresented in the square cast of countenance and large physical\r\ndevelopment of the new colonial magistrates. So far as a demeanor of\r\nnatural authority was concerned, the mother country need not have been\r\nashamed to see these foremost men of an actual democracy adopted into\r\nthe House of Peers, or made the Privy Council of the sovereign.\r\n\r\nNext in order to the magistrates came the young and eminently\r\ndistinguished divine, from whose lips the religious discourse of the\r\nanniversary was expected. His was the profession, at that era, in\r\nwhich intellectual ability displayed itself far more than in political\r\nlife; for—leaving a higher motive out of the question—it offered\r\ninducements powerful enough, in the almost worshipping respect of the\r\ncommunity, to win the most aspiring ambition into its service. Even\r\npolitical power—as in the case of Increase Mather—was within the\r\ngrasp of a successful priest.\r\n\r\nIt was the observation of those who beheld him now, that never, since\r\nMr. Dimmesdale first set his foot on the New England shore, had he\r\nexhibited such energy as was seen in the gait and air with which he\r\nkept his pace in the procession. There was no feebleness of step, as\r\nat other times; his frame was not bent; nor did his hand rest\r\nominously upon his heart. Yet, if the clergyman were rightly viewed,\r\nhis strength seemed not of the body. It might be spiritual, and\r\nimparted to him by angelic ministrations. It might be the exhilaration\r\nof that potent cordial, which is distilled only in the furnace-glow of\r\nearnest and long-continued thought. Or, perchance, his sensitive\r\ntemperament was invigorated by the loud and piercing music, that\r\nswelled heavenward, and uplifted him on its ascending wave.\r\nNevertheless, so abstracted was his look, it might be questioned\r\nwhether Mr. Dimmesdale even heard the music. There was his body,\r\nmoving onward, and with an unaccustomed force. But where was his mind?\r\nFar and deep in its own region, busying itself, with preternatural\r\nactivity, to marshal a procession of stately thoughts that were soon\r\nto issue thence; and so he saw nothing, heard nothing, knew nothing,\r\nof what was around him; but the spiritual element took up the feeble\r\nframe, and carried it along, unconscious of the burden, and converting\r\nit to spirit like itself. Men of uncommon intellect, who have grown\r\nmorbid, possess this occasional power of mighty effort, into which\r\nthey throw the life of many days, and then are lifeless for as many\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nHester Prynne, gazing steadfastly at the clergyman, felt a dreary\r\ninfluence come over her, but wherefore or whence she knew not; unless\r\nthat he seemed so remote from her own sphere, and utterly beyond her\r\nreach. One glance of recognition, she had imagined, must needs pass\r\nbetween them. She thought of the dim forest, with its little dell of\r\nsolitude, and love, and anguish, and the mossy tree-trunk, where,\r\nsitting hand in hand, they had mingled their sad and passionate talk\r\nwith the melancholy murmur of the brook. How deeply had they known\r\neach other then! And was this the man? She hardly knew him now! He,\r\nmoving proudly past, enveloped, as it were, in the rich music, with\r\nthe procession of majestic and venerable fathers; he, so unattainable\r\nin his worldly position, and still more so in that far vista of his\r\nunsympathizing thoughts, through which she now beheld him! Her spirit\r\nsank with the idea that all must have been a delusion, and that,\r\nvividly as she had dreamed it, there could be no real bond betwixt the\r\nclergyman and herself. And thus much of woman was there in Hester,\r\nthat she could scarcely forgive him,—least of all now, when the heavy\r\nfootstep of their approaching Fate might be heard, nearer, nearer,\r\nnearer!—for being able so completely to withdraw himself from their\r\nmutual world; while she groped darkly, and stretched forth her cold\r\nhands, and found him not.\r\n\r\nPearl either saw and responded to her mother’s feelings, or herself\r\nfelt the remoteness and intangibility that had fallen around the\r\nminister. While the procession passed, the child was uneasy,\r\nfluttering up and down, like a bird on the point of taking flight.\r\nWhen the whole had gone by, she looked up into Hester’s face.\r\n\r\n“Mother,” said she, “was that the same minister that kissed me by the\r\nbrook?”\r\n\r\n“Hold thy peace, dear little Pearl!” whispered her mother. “We must\r\nnot always talk in the market-place of what happens to us in the\r\nforest.”\r\n\r\n“I could not be sure that it was he; so strange he looked,” continued\r\nthe child. “Else I would have run to him, and bid him kiss me now,\r\nbefore all the people; even as he did yonder among the dark old trees.\r\nWhat would the minister have said, mother? Would he have clapped his\r\nhand over his heart, and scowled on me, and bid me be gone?”\r\n\r\n“What should he say, Pearl,” answered Hester, “save that it was no\r\ntime to kiss, and that kisses are not to be given in the market-place?\r\nWell for thee, foolish child, that thou didst not speak to him!”\r\n\r\nAnother shade of the same sentiment, in reference to Mr. Dimmesdale,\r\nwas expressed by a person whose eccentricities—or insanity, as we\r\nshould term it—led her to do what few of the towns-people would have\r\nventured on; to begin a conversation with the wearer of the scarlet\r\nletter, in public. It was Mistress Hibbins, who, arrayed in great\r\nmagnificence, with a triple ruff, a broidered stomacher, a gown of\r\nrich velvet, and a gold-headed cane, had come forth to see the\r\nprocession. As this ancient lady had the renown (which subsequently\r\ncost her no less a price than her life) of being a principal actor in\r\nall the works of necromancy that were continually going forward, the\r\ncrowd gave way before her, and seemed to fear the touch of her\r\ngarment, as if it carried the plague among its gorgeous folds. Seen in\r\nconjunction with Hester Prynne,—kindly as so many now felt towards\r\nthe latter,—the dread inspired by Mistress Hibbins was doubled, and\r\ncaused a general movement from that part of the market-place in which\r\nthe two women stood.\r\n\r\n“Now, what mortal imagination could conceive it!” whispered the old\r\nlady, confidentially, to Hester. “Yonder divine man! That saint on\r\nearth, as the people uphold him to be, and as—I must needs say—he\r\nreally looks! Who, now, that saw him pass in the procession, would\r\nthink how little while it is since he went forth out of his\r\nstudy,—chewing a Hebrew text of Scripture in his mouth, I\r\nwarrant,—to take an airing in the forest! Aha! we know what that\r\nmeans, Hester Prynne! But, truly, forsooth, I find it hard to believe\r\nhim the same man. Many a church-member saw I, walking behind the\r\nmusic, that has danced in the same measure with me, when Somebody was\r\nfiddler, and, it might be, an Indian powwow or a Lapland wizard\r\nchanging hands with us! That is but a trifle, when a woman knows the\r\nworld. But this minister! Couldst thou surely tell, Hester, whether he\r\nwas the same man that encountered thee on the forest-path?”\r\n\r\n“Madam, I know not of what you speak,” answered Hester Prynne, feeling\r\nMistress Hibbins to be of infirm mind; yet strangely startled and\r\nawe-stricken by the confidence with which she affirmed a personal\r\nconnection between so many persons (herself among them) and the Evil\r\nOne. “It is not for me to talk lightly of a learned and pious minister\r\nof the Word, like the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale!”\r\n\r\n“Fie, woman, fie!” cried the old lady, shaking her finger at Hester.\r\n“Dost thou think I have been to the forest so many times, and have yet\r\nno skill to judge who else has been there? Yea; though no leaf of the\r\nwild garlands, which they wore while they danced, be left in their\r\nhair! I know thee, Hester; for I behold the token. We may all see it\r\nin the sunshine; and it glows like a red flame in the dark. Thou\r\nwearest it openly; so there need be no question about that. But this\r\nminister! Let me tell thee, in thine ear! When the Black Man sees one\r\nof his own servants, signed and sealed, so shy of owning to the bond\r\nas is the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, he hath a way of ordering matters\r\nso that the mark shall be disclosed in open daylight to the eyes of\r\nall the world! What is it that the minister seeks to hide, with his\r\nhand always over his heart? Ha, Hester Prynne!”\r\n\r\n“What is it, good Mistress Hibbins?” eagerly asked little Pearl. “Hast\r\nthou seen it?”\r\n\r\n“No matter, darling!” responded Mistress Hibbins, making Pearl a\r\nprofound reverence. “Thou thyself wilt see it, one time or another.\r\nThey say, child, thou art of the lineage of the Prince of the Air!\r\nWilt thou ride with me, some fine night, to see thy father? Then thou\r\nshalt know wherefore the minister keeps his hand over his heart!”\r\n\r\nLaughing so shrilly that all the market-place could hear her, the\r\nweird old gentlewoman took her departure.\r\n\r\nBy this time the preliminary prayer had been offered in the\r\nmeeting-house, and the accents of the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale were\r\nheard commencing his discourse. An irresistible feeling kept Hester\r\nnear the spot. As the sacred edifice was too much thronged to admit\r\nanother auditor, she took up her position close beside the scaffold of\r\nthe pillory. It was in sufficient proximity to bring the whole sermon\r\nto her ears, in the shape of an indistinct, but varied, murmur and\r\nflow of the minister’s very peculiar voice.\r\n\r\nThis vocal organ was in itself a rich endowment; insomuch that a\r\nlistener, comprehending nothing of the language in which the preacher\r\nspoke, might still have been swayed to and fro by the mere tone and\r\ncadence. Like all other music, it breathed passion and pathos, and\r\nemotions high or tender, in a tongue native to the human heart,\r\nwherever educated. Muffled as the sound was by its passage through the\r\nchurch-walls, Hester Prynne listened with such intentness, and\r\nsympathized so intimately, that the sermon had throughout a meaning\r\nfor her, entirely apart from its indistinguishable words. These,\r\nperhaps, if more distinctly heard, might have been only a grosser\r\nmedium, and have clogged the spiritual sense. Now she caught the low\r\nundertone, as of the wind sinking down to repose itself; then ascended\r\nwith it, as it rose through progressive gradations of sweetness and\r\npower, until its volume seemed to envelop her with an atmosphere of\r\nawe and solemn grandeur. And yet, majestic as the voice sometimes\r\nbecame, there was forever in it an essential character of\r\nplaintiveness. A loud or low expression of anguish,—the whisper, or\r\nthe shriek, as it might be conceived, of suffering humanity, that\r\ntouched a sensibility in every bosom! At times this deep strain of\r\npathos was all that could be heard, and scarcely heard, sighing amid a\r\ndesolate silence. But even when the minister’s voice grew high and\r\ncommanding,—when it gushed irrepressibly upward,—when it assumed its\r\nutmost breadth and power, so overfilling the church as to burst its\r\nway through the solid walls, and diffuse itself in the open\r\nair,—still, if the auditor listened intently, and for the purpose, he\r\ncould detect the same cry of pain. What was it? The complaint of a\r\nhuman heart, sorrow-laden, perchance guilty, telling its secret,\r\nwhether of guilt or sorrow, to the great heart of mankind; beseeching\r\nits sympathy or forgiveness,—at every moment,—in each accent,—and\r\nnever in vain! It was this profound and continual undertone that gave\r\nthe clergyman his most appropriate power.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time, Hester stood, statue-like, at the foot of the\r\nscaffold. If the minister’s voice had not kept her there, there would\r\nnevertheless have been an inevitable magnetism in that spot, whence\r\nshe dated the first hour of her life of ignominy. There was a sense\r\nwithin her,—too ill-defined to be made a thought, but weighing\r\nheavily on her mind,—that her whole orb of life, both before and\r\nafter, was connected with this spot, as with the one point that gave\r\nit unity.\r\n\r\nLittle Pearl, meanwhile, had quitted her mother’s side, and was\r\nplaying at her own will about the market-place. She made the sombre\r\ncrowd cheerful by her erratic and glistening ray; even as a bird of\r\nbright plumage illuminates a whole tree of dusky foliage, by darting\r\nto and fro, half seen and half concealed amid the twilight of the\r\nclustering leaves. She had an undulating, but, oftentimes, a sharp and\r\nirregular movement. It indicated the restless vivacity of her spirit,\r\nwhich to-day was doubly indefatigable in its tiptoe dance, because it\r\nwas played upon and vibrated with her mother’s disquietude. Whenever\r\nPearl saw anything to excite her ever-active and wandering curiosity,\r\nshe flew thitherward and, as we might say, seized upon that man or\r\nthing as her own property, so far as she desired it; but without\r\nyielding the minutest degree of control over her motions in requital.\r\nThe Puritans looked on, and, if they smiled, were none the less\r\ninclined to pronounce the child a demon offspring, from the\r\nindescribable charm of beauty and eccentricity that shone through her\r\nlittle figure, and sparkled with its activity. She ran and looked the\r\nwild Indian in the face; and he grew conscious of a nature wilder than\r\nhis own. Thence, with native audacity, but still with a reserve as\r\ncharacteristic, she flew into the midst of a group of mariners, the\r\nswarthy-cheeked wild men of the ocean, as the Indians were of the\r\nland; and they gazed wonderingly and admiringly at Pearl, as if a\r\nflake of the sea-foam had taken the shape of a little maid, and were\r\ngifted with a soul of the sea-fire, that flashes beneath the prow in\r\nthe night-time.\r\n\r\nOne of these seafaring men—the shipmaster, indeed, who had spoken to\r\nHester Prynne—was so smitten with Pearl’s aspect, that he attempted\r\nto lay hands upon her, with purpose to snatch a kiss. Finding it as\r\nimpossible to touch her as to catch a humming-bird in the air, he took\r\nfrom his hat the gold chain that was twisted about it, and threw it to\r\nthe child. Pearl immediately twined it around her neck and waist,\r\nwith such happy skill, that, once seen there, it became a part of her,\r\nand it was difficult to imagine her without it.\r\n\r\n“Thy mother is yonder woman with the scarlet letter,” said the seaman.\r\n“Wilt thou carry her a message from me?”\r\n\r\n“If the message pleases me, I will,” answered Pearl.\r\n\r\n“Then tell her,” rejoined he, “that I spake again with the\r\nblack-a-visaged, hump-shouldered old doctor, and he engages to bring\r\nhis friend, the gentleman she wots of, aboard with him. So let thy\r\nmother take no thought, save for herself and thee. Wilt thou tell her\r\nthis, thou witch-baby?”\r\n\r\n“Mistress Hibbins says my father is the Prince of the Air!” cried\r\nPearl, with a naughty smile. “If thou callest me that ill name, I\r\nshall tell him of thee; and he will chase thy ship with a tempest!”\r\n\r\nPursuing a zigzag course across the market-place, the child returned\r\nto her mother, and communicated what the mariner had said. Hester’s\r\nstrong, calm, steadfastly enduring spirit almost sank, at last, on\r\nbeholding this dark and grim countenance of an inevitable doom,\r\nwhich—at the moment when a passage seemed to open for the minister\r\nand herself out of their labyrinth of misery—showed itself, with an\r\nunrelenting smile, right in the midst of their path.\r\n\r\nWith her mind harassed by the terrible perplexity in which the\r\nshipmaster’s intelligence involved her, she was also subjected to\r\nanother trial. There were many people present, from the country round\r\nabout, who had often heard of the scarlet letter, and to whom it had\r\nbeen made terrific by a hundred false or exaggerated rumors, but who\r\nhad never beheld it with their own bodily eyes. These, after\r\nexhausting other modes of amusement, now thronged about Hester Prynne\r\nwith rude and boorish intrusiveness. Unscrupulous as it was, however,\r\nit could not bring them nearer than a circuit of several yards. At\r\nthat distance they accordingly stood, fixed there by the centrifugal\r\nforce of the repugnance which the mystic symbol inspired. The whole\r\ngang of sailors, likewise, observing the press of spectators, and\r\nlearning the purport of the scarlet letter, came and thrust their\r\nsunburnt and desperado-looking faces into the ring. Even the Indians\r\nwere affected by a sort of cold shadow of the white man’s curiosity,\r\nand, gliding through the crowd, fastened their snake-like black eyes\r\non Hester’s bosom; conceiving, perhaps, that the wearer of this\r\nbrilliantly embroidered badge must needs be a personage of high\r\ndignity among her people. Lastly the inhabitants of the town (their\r\nown interest in this worn-out subject languidly reviving itself, by\r\nsympathy with what they saw others feel) lounged idly to the same\r\nquarter, and tormented Hester Prynne, perhaps more than all the rest,\r\nwith their cool, well-acquainted gaze at her familiar shame. Hester\r\nsaw and recognized the selfsame faces of that group of matrons, who\r\nhad awaited her forthcoming from the prison-door, seven years ago; all\r\nsave one, the youngest and only compassionate among them, whose\r\nburial-robe she had since made. At the final hour, when she was so\r\nsoon to fling aside the burning letter, it had strangely become the\r\ncentre of more remark and excitement, and was thus made to sear her\r\nbreast more painfully, than at any time since the first day she put it\r\non.\r\n\r\nWhile Hester stood in that magic circle of ignominy, where the cunning\r\ncruelty of her sentence seemed to have fixed her forever, the\r\nadmirable preacher was looking down from the sacred pulpit upon an\r\naudience whose very inmost spirits had yielded to his control. The\r\nsainted minister in the church! The woman of the scarlet letter in the\r\nmarket-place! What imagination would have been irreverent enough to\r\nsurmise that the same scorching stigma was on them both!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\n [Illustration]"

      "content": "THE REVELATION OF THE SCARLET LETTER.\r\n\nThe eloquent voice, on which the souls of the listening audience had\r\nbeen borne aloft as on the swelling waves of the sea, at length came\r\nto a pause. There was a momentary silence, profound as what should\r\nfollow the utterance of oracles. Then ensued a murmur and half-hushed\r\ntumult; as if the auditors, released from the high spell that had\r\ntransported them into the region of another’s mind, were returning\r\ninto themselves, with all their awe and wonder still heavy on them. In\r\na moment more, the crowd began to gush forth from the doors of the\r\nchurch. Now that there was an end, they needed other breath, more fit\r\nto support the gross and earthly life into which they relapsed, than\r\nthat atmosphere which the preacher had converted into words of flame,\r\nand had burdened with the rich fragrance of his thought.\r\n\r\nIn the open air their rapture broke into speech. The street and the\r\nmarket-place absolutely babbled, from side to side, with applauses of\r\nthe minister. His hearers could not rest until they had told one\r\nanother of what each knew better than he could tell or hear. According\r\nto their united testimony, never had man spoken in so wise, so high,\r\nand so holy a spirit, as he that spake this day; nor had inspiration\r\never breathed through mortal lips more evidently than it did through\r\nhis. Its influence could be seen, as it were, descending upon him, and\r\npossessing him, and continually lifting him out of the written\r\ndiscourse that lay before him, and filling him with ideas that must\r\nhave been as marvellous to himself as to his audience. His subject, it\r\nappeared, had been the relation between the Deity and the communities\r\nof mankind, with a special reference to the New England which they\r\nwere here planting in the wilderness. And, as he drew towards the\r\nclose, a spirit as of prophecy had come upon him, constraining him to\r\nits purpose as mightily as the old prophets of Israel were\r\nconstrained; only with this difference, that, whereas the Jewish seers\r\nhad denounced judgments and ruin on their country, it was his mission\r\nto foretell a high and glorious destiny for the newly gathered people\r\nof the Lord. But, throughout it all, and through the whole discourse,\r\nthere had been a certain deep, sad undertone of pathos, which could\r\nnot be interpreted otherwise than as the natural regret of one soon to\r\npass away. Yes; their minister whom they so loved—and who so loved\r\nthem all, that he could not depart heavenward without a sigh—had the\r\nforeboding of untimely death upon him, and would soon leave them in\r\ntheir tears! This idea of his transitory stay on earth gave the last\r\nemphasis to the effect which the preacher had produced; it was as if\r\nan angel, in his passage to the skies, had shaken his bright wings\r\nover the people for an instant,—at once a shadow and a\r\nsplendor,—and had shed down a shower of golden truths upon them.\r\n\r\nThus, there had come to the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale—as to most men,\r\nin their various spheres, though seldom recognized until they see it\r\nfar behind them—an epoch of life more brilliant and full of triumph\r\nthan any previous one, or than any which could hereafter be. He stood,\r\nat this moment, on the very proudest eminence of superiority, to which\r\nthe gifts of intellect, rich lore, prevailing eloquence, and a\r\nreputation of whitest sanctity, could exalt a clergyman in New\r\nEngland’s earliest days, when the professional character was of itself\r\na lofty pedestal. Such was the position which the minister occupied,\r\nas he bowed his head forward on the cushions of the pulpit, at the\r\nclose of his Election Sermon. Meanwhile Hester Prynne was standing\r\nbeside the scaffold of the pillory, with the scarlet letter still\r\nburning on her breast!\r\n\r\nNow was heard again the clangor of the music, and the measured tramp\r\nof the military escort, issuing from the church-door. The procession\r\nwas to be marshalled thence to the town-hall, where a solemn banquet\r\nwould complete the ceremonies of the day.\r\n\r\nOnce more, therefore, the train of venerable and majestic fathers was\r\nseen moving through a broad pathway of the people, who drew back\r\nreverently, on either side, as the Governor and magistrates, the old\r\nand wise men, the holy ministers, and all that were eminent and\r\nrenowned, advanced into the midst of them. When they were fairly in\r\nthe market-place, their presence was greeted by a shout. This—though\r\ndoubtless it might acquire additional force and volume from the\r\nchildlike loyalty which the age awarded to its rulers—was felt to be\r\nan irrepressible outburst of enthusiasm kindled in the auditors by\r\nthat high strain of eloquence which was yet reverberating in their\r\nears. Each felt the impulse in himself, and, in the same breath,\r\ncaught it from his neighbor. Within the church, it had hardly been\r\nkept down; beneath the sky, it pealed upward to the zenith. There were\r\nhuman beings enough, and enough of highly wrought and symphonious\r\nfeeling, to produce that more impressive sound than the organ tones of\r\nthe blast, or the thunder, or the roar of the sea; even that mighty\r\nswell of many voices, blended into one great voice by the universal\r\nimpulse which makes likewise one vast heart out of the many. Never,\r\nfrom the soil of New England, had gone up such a shout! Never, on New\r\nEngland soil, had stood the man so honored by his mortal brethren as\r\nthe preacher!\r\n\r\nHow fared it with him then? Were there not the brilliant particles of\r\na halo in the air about his head? So etherealized by spirit as he was,\r\nand so apotheosized by worshipping admirers, did his footsteps, in the\r\nprocession, really tread upon the dust of earth?\r\n\r\nAs the ranks of military men and civil fathers moved onward, all eyes\r\nwere turned towards the point where the minister was seen to approach\r\namong them. The shout died into a murmur, as one portion of the crowd\r\nafter another obtained a glimpse of him. How feeble and pale he\r\nlooked, amid all his triumph! The energy—or say, rather, the\r\ninspiration which had held him up, until he should have delivered the\r\nsacred message that brought its own strength along with it from\r\nheaven—was withdrawn, now that it had so faithfully performed its\r\noffice. The glow, which they had just before beheld burning on his\r\ncheek, was extinguished, like a flame that sinks down hopelessly\r\namong the late-decaying embers. It seemed hardly the face of a man\r\nalive, with such a death-like hue; it was hardly a man with life in\r\nhim, that tottered on his path so nervelessly, yet tottered, and did\r\nnot fall!\r\n\r\nOne of his clerical brethren,—it was the venerable John\r\nWilson,—observing the state in which Mr. Dimmesdale was left by the\r\nretiring wave of intellect and sensibility, stepped forward hastily to\r\noffer his support. The minister tremulously, but decidedly, repelled\r\nthe old man’s arm. He still walked onward, if that movement could be\r\nso described, which rather resembled the wavering effort of an infant,\r\nwith its mother’s arms in view, outstretched to tempt him forward. And\r\nnow, almost imperceptible as were the latter steps of his progress, he\r\nhad come opposite the well-remembered and weather-darkened scaffold,\r\nwhere, long since, with all that dreary lapse of time between, Hester\r\nPrynne had encountered the world’s ignominious stare. There stood\r\nHester, holding little Pearl by the hand! And there was the scarlet\r\nletter on her breast! The minister here made a pause; although the\r\nmusic still played the stately and rejoicing march to which the\r\nprocession moved. It summoned him onward,—onward to the\r\nfestival!—but here he made a pause.\r\n\r\nBellingham, for the last few moments, had kept an anxious eye upon\r\nhim. He now left his own place in the procession, and advanced to give\r\nassistance; judging, from Mr. Dimmesdale’s aspect, that he must\r\notherwise inevitably fall. But there was something in the latter’s\r\nexpression that warned back the magistrate, although a man not readily\r\nobeying the vague intimations that pass from one spirit to another.\r\nThe crowd, meanwhile, looked on with awe and wonder. This earthly\r\nfaintness was, in their view, only another phase of the minister’s\r\ncelestial strength; nor would it have seemed a miracle too high to be\r\nwrought for one so holy, had he ascended before their eyes, waxing\r\ndimmer and brighter, and fading at last into the light of heaven.\r\n\r\nHe turned towards the scaffold, and stretched forth his arms.\r\n\r\n“Hester,” said he, “come hither! Come, my little Pearl!”\r\n\r\nIt was a ghastly look with which he regarded them; but there was\r\nsomething at once tender and strangely triumphant in it. The child,\r\nwith the bird-like motion which was one of her characteristics, flew\r\nto him, and clasped her arms about his knees. Hester Prynne—slowly,\r\nas if impelled by inevitable fate, and against her strongest\r\nwill—likewise drew near, but paused before she reached him. At this\r\ninstant, old Roger Chillingworth thrust himself through the\r\ncrowd,—or, perhaps, so dark, disturbed, and evil, was his look, he\r\nrose up out of some nether region,—to snatch back his victim from\r\nwhat he sought to do! Be that as it might, the old man rushed forward,\r\nand caught the minister by the arm.\r\n\r\n“Madman, hold! what is your purpose?” whispered he. “Wave back that\r\nwoman! Cast off this child! All shall be well! Do not blacken your\r\nfame, and perish in dishonor! I can yet save you! Would you bring\r\ninfamy on your sacred profession?”\r\n\r\n“Ha, tempter! Methinks thou art too late!” answered the minister,\r\nencountering his eye, fearfully, but firmly. “Thy power is not what it\r\nwas! With God’s help, I shall escape thee now!”\r\n\r\nHe again extended his hand to the woman of the scarlet letter.\r\n\r\n“Hester Prynne,” cried he, with a piercing earnestness, “in the name\r\nof Him, so terrible and so merciful, who gives me grace, at this last\r\nmoment, to do what—for my own heavy sin and miserable agony—I\r\nwithheld myself from doing seven years ago, come hither now, and twine\r\nthy strength about me! Thy strength, Hester; but let it be guided by\r\nthe will which God hath granted me! This wretched and wronged old man\r\nis opposing it with all his might!—with all his own might, and the\r\nfiend’s! Come, Hester, come! Support me up yonder scaffold!”\r\n\r\nThe crowd was in a tumult. The men of rank and dignity, who stood more\r\nimmediately around the clergyman, were so taken by surprise, and so\r\nperplexed as to the purport of what they saw,—unable to receive the\r\nexplanation which most readily presented itself, or to imagine any\r\nother,—that they remained silent and inactive spectators of the\r\njudgment which Providence seemed about to work. They beheld the\r\nminister, leaning on Hester’s shoulder, and supported by her arm\r\naround him, approach the scaffold, and ascend its steps; while still\r\nthe little hand of the sin-born child was clasped in his. Old Roger\r\nChillingworth followed, as one intimately connected with the drama of\r\nguilt and sorrow in which they had all been actors, and well entitled,\r\ntherefore, to be present at its closing scene.\r\n\r\n“Hadst thou sought the whole earth over,” said he, looking darkly at\r\nthe clergyman, “there was no one place so secret,—no high place nor\r\nlowly place, where thou couldst have escaped me,—save on this very\r\nscaffold!”\r\n\r\n“Thanks be to Him who hath led me hither!” answered the minister.\r\n\r\nYet he trembled, and turned to Hester with an expression of doubt and\r\nanxiety in his eyes, not the less evidently betrayed, that there was a\r\nfeeble smile upon his lips.\r\n\r\n“Is not this better,” murmured he, “than what we dreamed of in the\r\nforest?”\r\n\r\n“I know not! I know not!” she hurriedly replied. “Better? Yea; so we\r\nmay both die, and little Pearl die with us!”\r\n\r\n“For thee and Pearl, be it as God shall order,” said the minister;\r\n“and God is merciful! Let me now do the will which he hath made plain\r\nbefore my sight. For, Hester, I am a dying man. So let me make haste\r\nto take my shame upon me!”\r\n\r\nPartly supported by Hester Prynne, and holding one hand of little\r\nPearl’s, the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale turned to the dignified and\r\nvenerable rulers; to the holy ministers, who were his brethren; to the\r\npeople, whose great heart was thoroughly appalled, yet overflowing\r\nwith tearful sympathy, as knowing that some deep life-matter—which,\r\nif full of sin, was full of anguish and repentance likewise—was now\r\nto be laid open to them. The sun, but little past its meridian, shone\r\ndown upon the clergyman, and gave a distinctness to his figure, as he\r\nstood out from all the earth, to put in his plea of guilty at the bar\r\nof Eternal Justice.\r\n\r\n“People of New England!” cried he, with a voice that rose over them,\r\nhigh, solemn, and majestic,—yet had always a tremor through it, and\r\nsometimes a shriek, struggling up out of a fathomless depth of remorse\r\nand woe,—“ye, that have loved me!—ye, that have deemed me\r\nholy!—behold me here, the one sinner of the world! At last!—at\r\nlast!—I stand upon the spot where, seven years since, I should have\r\nstood; here, with this woman, whose arm, more than the little strength\r\nwherewith I have crept hitherward, sustains me, at this dreadful\r\nmoment, from grovelling down upon my face! Lo, the scarlet letter\r\nwhich Hester wears! Ye have all shuddered at it! Wherever her walk\r\nhath been,—wherever, so miserably burdened, she may have hoped to\r\nfind repose,—it hath cast a lurid gleam of awe and horrible\r\nrepugnance round about her. But there stood one in the midst of you,\r\nat whose brand of sin and infamy ye have not shuddered!”\r\n\r\nIt seemed, at this point, as if the minister must leave the remainder\r\nof his secret undisclosed. But he fought back the bodily\r\nweakness,—and, still more, the faintness of heart,—that was striving\r\nfor the mastery with him. He threw off all assistance, and stepped\r\npassionately forward a pace before the woman and the child.\r\n\r\n“It was on him!” he continued, with a kind of fierceness; so\r\ndetermined was he to speak out the whole. “God’s eye beheld it! The\r\nangels were forever pointing at it! The Devil knew it well, and\r\nfretted it continually with the touch of his burning finger! But he\r\nhid it cunningly from men, and walked among you with the mien of a\r\nspirit, mournful, because so pure in a sinful world!—and sad, because\r\nhe missed his heavenly kindred! Now, at the death-hour, he stands up\r\nbefore you! He bids you look again at Hester’s scarlet letter! He\r\ntells you, that, with all its mysterious horror, it is but the shadow\r\nof what he bears on his own breast, and that even this, his own red\r\nstigma, is no more than the type of what has seared his inmost heart!\r\nStand any here that question God’s judgment on a sinner? Behold!\r\nBehold a dreadful witness of it!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Shall we not meet again?”]\r\n\r\nWith a convulsive motion, he tore away the ministerial band from\r\nbefore his breast. It was revealed! But it were irreverent to describe\r\nthat revelation. For an instant, the gaze of the horror-stricken\r\nmultitude was concentred on the ghastly miracle; while the minister\r\nstood, with a flush of triumph in his face, as one who, in the\r\ncrisis of acutest pain, had won a victory. Then, down he sank upon the\r\nscaffold! Hester partly raised him, and supported his head against her\r\nbosom. Old Roger Chillingworth knelt down beside him, with a blank,\r\ndull countenance, out of which the life seemed to have departed.\r\n\r\n“Thou hast escaped me!” he repeated more than once. “Thou hast escaped\r\nme!”\r\n\r\n“May God forgive thee!” said the minister. “Thou, too, hast deeply\r\nsinned!”\r\n\r\nHe withdrew his dying eyes from the old man, and fixed them on the\r\nwoman and the child.\r\n\r\n“My little Pearl,” said he, feebly,—and there was a sweet and gentle\r\nsmile over his face, as of a spirit sinking into deep repose; nay, now\r\nthat the burden was removed, it seemed almost as if he would be\r\nsportive with the child,—“dear little Pearl, wilt thou kiss me now?\r\nThou wouldst not, yonder, in the forest! But now thou wilt?”\r\n\r\nPearl kissed his lips. A spell was broken. The great scene of grief,\r\nin which the wild infant bore a part, had developed all her\r\nsympathies; and as her tears fell upon her father’s cheek, they were\r\nthe pledge that she would grow up amid human joy and sorrow, nor\r\nforever do battle with the world, but be a woman in it. Towards her\r\nmother, too, Pearl’s errand as a messenger of anguish was all\r\nfulfilled.\r\n\r\n“Hester,” said the clergyman, “farewell!”\r\n\r\n“Shall we not meet again?” whispered she, bending her face down close\r\nto his. “Shall we not spend our immortal life together? Surely,\r\nsurely, we have ransomed one another, with all this woe! Thou lookest\r\nfar into eternity, with those bright dying eyes! Then tell me what\r\nthou seest?”\r\n\r\n“Hush, Hester, hush!” said he, with tremulous solemnity. “The law we\r\nbroke!—the sin here so awfully revealed!—let these alone be in thy\r\nthoughts! I fear! I fear! It may be, that, when we forgot our\r\nGod,—when we violated our reverence each for the other’s soul,—it\r\nwas thenceforth vain to hope that we could meet hereafter, in an\r\neverlasting and pure reunion. God knows; and He is merciful! He hath\r\nproved his mercy, most of all, in my afflictions. By giving me this\r\nburning torture to bear upon my breast! By sending yonder dark and\r\nterrible old man, to keep the torture always at red-heat! By bringing\r\nme hither, to die this death of triumphant ignominy before the people!\r\nHad either of these agonies been wanting, I had been lost forever!\r\nPraised be his name! His will be done! Farewell!”\r\n\r\nThat final word came forth with the minister’s expiring breath. The\r\nmultitude, silent till then, broke out in a strange, deep voice of awe\r\nand wonder, which could not as yet find utterance, save in this murmur\r\nthat rolled so heavily after the departed spirit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\n [Illustration]"

      "content": "CONCLUSION.\r\n\nAfter many days, when time sufficed for the people to arrange their\r\nthoughts in reference to the foregoing scene, there was more than one\r\naccount of what had been witnessed on the scaffold.\r\n\r\nMost of the spectators testified to having seen, on the breast of the\r\nunhappy minister, a SCARLET LETTER—the very semblance of that worn by\r\nHester Prynne—imprinted in the flesh. As regarded its origin, there\r\nwere various explanations, all of which must necessarily have been\r\nconjectural. Some affirmed that the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, on the\r\nvery day when Hester Prynne first wore her ignominious badge, had\r\nbegun a course of penance,—which he afterwards, in so many futile\r\nmethods, followed out,—by inflicting a hideous torture on himself.\r\nOthers contended that the stigma had not been produced until a long\r\ntime subsequent, when old Roger Chillingworth, being a potent\r\nnecromancer, had caused it to appear, through the agency of magic and\r\npoisonous drugs. Others, again,—and those best able to appreciate\r\nthe minister’s peculiar sensibility, and the wonderful operation of\r\nhis spirit upon the body,—whispered their belief, that the awful\r\nsymbol was the effect of the ever-active tooth of remorse, gnawing\r\nfrom the inmost heart outwardly, and at last manifesting Heaven’s\r\ndreadful judgment by the visible presence of the letter. The reader\r\nmay choose among these theories. We have thrown all the light we could\r\nacquire upon the portent, and would gladly, now that it has done its\r\noffice, erase its deep print out of our own brain; where long\r\nmeditation has fixed it in very undesirable distinctness.\r\n\r\nIt is singular, nevertheless, that certain persons, who were\r\nspectators of the whole scene, and professed never once to have\r\nremoved their eyes from the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, denied that there\r\nwas any mark whatever on his breast, more than on a new-born infant’s.\r\nNeither, by their report, had his dying words acknowledged, nor even\r\nremotely implied, any, the slightest connection, on his part, with the\r\nguilt for which Hester Prynne had so long worn the scarlet letter.\r\nAccording to these highly respectable witnesses, the minister,\r\nconscious that he was dying,—conscious, also, that the reverence of\r\nthe multitude placed him already among saints and angels,—had\r\ndesired, by yielding up his breath in the arms of that fallen woman,\r\nto express to the world how utterly nugatory is the choicest of man’s\r\nown righteousness. After exhausting life in his efforts for mankind’s\r\nspiritual good, he had made the manner of his death a parable, in\r\norder to impress on his admirers the mighty and mournful lesson, that,\r\nin the view of Infinite Purity, we are sinners all alike. It was to\r\nteach them, that the holiest among us has but attained so far above\r\nhis fellows as to discern more clearly the Mercy which looks down,\r\nand repudiate more utterly the phantom of human merit, which would\r\nlook aspiringly upward. Without disputing a truth so momentous, we\r\nmust be allowed to consider this version of Mr. Dimmesdale’s story as\r\nonly an instance of that stubborn fidelity with which a man’s\r\nfriends—and especially a clergyman’s—will sometimes uphold his\r\ncharacter, when proofs, clear as the mid-day sunshine on the scarlet\r\nletter, establish him a false and sin-stained creature of the dust.\r\n\r\nThe authority which we have chiefly followed,—a manuscript of old\r\ndate, drawn up from the verbal testimony of individuals, some of whom\r\nhad known Hester Prynne, while others had heard the tale from\r\ncontemporary witnesses,—fully confirms the view taken in the\r\nforegoing pages. Among many morals which press upon us from the poor\r\nminister’s miserable experience, we put only this into a\r\nsentence:—“Be true! Be true! Be true! Show freely to the world, if\r\nnot your worst, yet some trait whereby the worst may be inferred!”\r\n\r\nNothing was more remarkable than the change which took place, almost\r\nimmediately after Mr. Dimmesdale’s death, in the appearance and\r\ndemeanor of the old man known as Roger Chillingworth. All his strength\r\nand energy—all his vital and intellectual force—seemed at once to\r\ndesert him; insomuch that he positively withered up, shrivelled away,\r\nand almost vanished from mortal sight, like an uprooted weed that lies\r\nwilting in the sun. This unhappy man had made the very principle of\r\nhis life to consist in the pursuit and systematic exercise of revenge;\r\nand when, by its completest triumph and consummation, that evil\r\nprinciple was left with no further material to support it, when, in\r\nshort, there was no more Devil’s work on earth for him to do, it only\r\nremained for the unhumanized mortal to betake himself whither his\r\nMaster would find him tasks enough, and pay him his wages duly. But,\r\nto all these shadowy beings, so long our near acquaintances,—as well\r\nRoger Chillingworth as his companions,—we would fain be merciful. It\r\nis a curious subject of observation and inquiry, whether hatred and\r\nlove be not the same thing at bottom. Each, in its utmost development,\r\nsupposes a high degree of intimacy and heart-knowledge; each renders\r\none individual dependent for the food of his affections and spiritual\r\nlife upon another; each leaves the passionate lover, or the no less\r\npassionate hater, forlorn and desolate by the withdrawal of his\r\nsubject. Philosophically considered, therefore, the two passions seem\r\nessentially the same, except that one happens to be seen in a\r\ncelestial radiance, and the other in a dusky and lurid glow. In the\r\nspiritual world, the old physician and the minister—mutual victims as\r\nthey have been—may, unawares, have found their earthly stock of\r\nhatred and antipathy transmuted into golden love.\r\n\r\nLeaving this discussion apart, we have a matter of business to\r\ncommunicate to the reader. At old Roger Chillingworth’s decease,\r\n(which took place within the year,) and by his last will and\r\ntestament, of which Governor Bellingham and the Reverend Mr. Wilson\r\nwere executors, he bequeathed a very considerable amount of property,\r\nboth here and in England, to little Pearl, the daughter of Hester\r\nPrynne.\r\n\r\nSo Pearl—the elf-child,—the demon offspring, as some people, up to\r\nthat epoch, persisted in considering her,—became the richest heiress\r\nof her day, in the New World. Not improbably, this circumstance\r\nwrought a very material change in the public estimation; and, had the\r\nmother and child remained here, little Pearl, at a marriageable period\r\nof life, might have mingled her wild blood with the lineage of the\r\ndevoutest Puritan among them all. But, in no long time after the\r\nphysician’s death, the wearer of the scarlet letter disappeared, and\r\nPearl along with her. For many years, though a vague report would now\r\nand then find its way across the sea,—like a shapeless piece of\r\ndrift-wood tost ashore, with the initials of a name upon it,—yet no\r\ntidings of them unquestionably authentic were received. The story of\r\nthe scarlet letter grew into a legend. Its spell, however, was still\r\npotent, and kept the scaffold awful where the poor minister had died,\r\nand likewise the cottage by the sea-shore, where Hester Prynne had\r\ndwelt. Near this latter spot, one afternoon, some children were at\r\nplay, when they beheld a tall woman, in a gray robe, approach the\r\ncottage-door. In all those years it had never once been opened; but\r\neither she unlocked it, or the decaying wood and iron yielded to her\r\nhand, or she glided shadow-like through these impediments,—and, at\r\nall events, went in.\r\n\r\nOn the threshold she paused,—turned partly round,—for, perchance,\r\nthe idea of entering all alone, and all so changed, the home of so\r\nintense a former life, was more dreary and desolate than even she\r\ncould bear. But her hesitation was only for an instant, though long\r\nenough to display a scarlet letter on her breast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hester’s Return]\r\n\r\nAnd Hester Prynne had returned, and taken up her long-forsaken shame!\r\nBut where was little Pearl? If still alive, she must now have been in\r\nthe flush and bloom of early womanhood. None knew—nor ever learned,\r\nwith the fulness of perfect certainty—whether the elf-child had gone\r\nthus untimely to a maiden grave; or whether her wild, rich nature had\r\nbeen softened and subdued, and made capable of a woman’s gentle\r\nhappiness. But, through the remainder of Hester’s life, there were\r\nindications that the recluse of the scarlet letter was the object of\r\nlove and interest with some inhabitant of another land. Letters came,\r\nwith armorial seals upon them, though of bearings unknown to English\r\nheraldry. In the cottage there were articles of comfort and luxury\r\nsuch as Hester never cared to use, but which only wealth could have\r\npurchased, and affection have imagined for her. There were trifles,\r\ntoo, little ornaments, beautiful tokens of a continual remembrance,\r\nthat must have been wrought by delicate fingers, at the impulse of a\r\nfond heart. And, once, Hester was seen embroidering a baby-garment,\r\nwith such a lavish richness of golden fancy as would have raised a\r\npublic tumult, had any infant, thus apparelled, been shown to our\r\nsober-hued community.\r\n\r\nIn fine, the gossips of that day believed,—and Mr. Surveyor Pue, who\r\nmade investigations a century later, believed,—and one of his recent\r\nsuccessors in office, moreover, faithfully believes,—that Pearl was\r\nnot only alive, but married, and happy, and mindful of her mother, and\r\nthat she would most joyfully have entertained that sad and lonely\r\nmother at her fireside.\r\n\r\nBut there was a more real life for Hester Prynne here, in New England,\r\nthan in that unknown region where Pearl had found a home. Here had\r\nbeen her sin; here, her sorrow; and here was yet to be her penitence.\r\nShe had returned, therefore, and resumed,—of her own free will, for\r\nnot the sternest magistrate of that iron period would have imposed\r\nit,—resumed the symbol of which we have related so dark a tale. Never\r\nafterwards did it quit her bosom. But, in the lapse of the toilsome,\r\nthoughtful, and self-devoted years that made up Hester’s life, the\r\nscarlet letter ceased to be a stigma which attracted the world’s scorn\r\nand bitterness, and became a type of something to be sorrowed over,\r\nand looked upon with awe, yet with reverence too. And, as Hester\r\nPrynne had no selfish ends, nor lived in any measure for her own\r\nprofit and enjoyment, people brought all their sorrows and\r\nperplexities, and besought her counsel, as one who had herself gone\r\nthrough a mighty trouble. Women, more especially,—in the continually\r\nrecurring trials of wounded, wasted, wronged, misplaced, or erring and\r\nsinful passion,—or with the dreary burden of a heart unyielded,\r\nbecause unvalued and unsought,—came to Hester’s cottage, demanding\r\nwhy they were so wretched, and what the remedy! Hester comforted and\r\ncounselled them as best she might. She assured them, too, of her firm\r\nbelief, that, at some brighter period, when the world should have\r\ngrown ripe for it, in Heaven’s own time, a new truth would be\r\nrevealed, in order to establish the whole relation between man and\r\nwoman on a surer ground of mutual happiness. Earlier in life, Hester\r\nhad vainly imagined that she herself might be the destined prophetess,\r\nbut had long since recognized the impossibility that any mission of\r\ndivine and mysterious truth should be confided to a woman stained with\r\nsin, bowed down with shame, or even burdened with a life-long sorrow.\r\nThe angel and apostle of the coming revelation must be a woman,\r\nindeed, but lofty, pure, and beautiful; and wise, moreover, not\r\nthrough dusky grief, but the ethereal medium of joy; and showing how\r\nsacred love should make us happy, by the truest test of a life\r\nsuccessful to such an end!\r\n\r\nSo said Hester Prynne, and glanced her sad eyes downward at the\r\nscarlet letter. And, after many, many years, a new grave was delved,\r\nnear an old and sunken one, in that burial-ground beside which King’s\r\nChapel has since been built. It was near that old and sunken grave,\r\nyet with a space between, as if the dust of the two sleepers had no\r\nright to mingle. Yet one tombstone served for both. All around, there\r\nwere monuments carved with armorial bearings; and on this simple slab\r\nof slate—as the curious investigator may still discern, and perplex\r\nhimself with the purport—there appeared the semblance of an engraved\r\nescutcheon. It bore a device, a herald’s wording of which might serve\r\nfor a motto and brief description of our now concluded legend; so\r\nsombre is it, and relieved only by one ever-glowing point of light\r\ngloomier than the shadow:—\r\n\r\n “ON A FIELD, SABLE, THE LETTER A, GULES.”\r\n\r\n [Illustration]\r\n\n Cambridge: Electrotyped and Printed by Welch, Bigelow, & Co.\r\n\n TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES\r\n\r\nObvious printer’s errors have been corrected; for the details, see\r\nbelow.
