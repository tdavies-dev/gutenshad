Blazes? says Joe.\r\n\r\nAnd says Bloom:\r\n\r\n—What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training\r\nthe eye.\r\n\r\n—Ay, Blazes, says Alf. He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up\r\nthe odds and he swatting all the time.\r\n\r\n—We know him, says the citizen. The traitor’s son. We know what put\r\nEnglish gold in his pocket.\r\n\r\n—True for you, says Joe.\r\n\r\nAnd Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the\r\nblood, asking Alf:\r\n\r\n—Now, don’t you think, Bergan?\r\n\r\n—Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf. Heenan and Sayers was only\r\na bloody fool to it. Handed him the father and mother of a beating. See\r\nthe little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping. God,\r\nhe gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made\r\nhim puke what he never ate.\r\n\r\nIt was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were\r\nscheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns.\r\nHandicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin’s pet lamb made up\r\nfor it by superlative skill in ringcraft. The final bout of fireworks\r\nwas a gruelling for both champions. The welterweight sergeantmajor had\r\ntapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had\r\nbeen receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in\r\nsome neat work on the pet’s nose, and Myler came on looking groggy. The\r\nsoldier got to business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which\r\nthe Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the\r\npoint of Bennett’s jaw. The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him\r\nwith a left hook, the body punch being a fine one. The men came to\r\nhandigrips. Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout\r\nending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him. The\r\nEnglishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he\r\nwas liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey\r\nand brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in\r\njigtime. It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it. The two\r\nfought like tigers and excitement ran fever high. The referee twice\r\ncautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his\r\nfootwork a treat to watch. After a brisk exchange of courtesies during\r\nwhich a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from\r\nhis opponent’s mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and\r\nlanded a terrific left to Battling Bennett’s stomach, flooring him\r\nflat. It was a knockout clean and clever. Amid tense expectation the\r\nPortobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett’s second Ole\r\nPfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared\r\nvictor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the\r\nringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.\r\n\r\n—He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf. I hear he’s\r\nrunning a concert tour now up in the north.\r\n\r\n—He is, says Joe. Isn’t he?\r\n\r\n—Who? says Bloom. Ah, yes. That’s quite true. Yes, a kind of summer\r\ntour, you see. Just a holiday.\r\n\r\n—Mrs B. is the bright particular star, isn’t she? says Joe.\r\n\r\n—My wife? says Bloom. She’s singing, yes. I think it will be a success\r\ntoo. He’s an excellent man to organise. Excellent.\r\n\r\nHoho begob says I to myself says I. That explains the milk in the\r\ncocoanut and absence of hair on the animal’s chest. Blazes doing the\r\ntootle on the flute. Concert tour. Dirty Dan the dodger’s son off\r\nIsland bridge that sold the same horses twice over to the government to\r\nfight the Boers. Old Whatwhat. I called about the poor and water rate,\r\nMr Boylan. You what? The water rate, Mr Boylan. You whatwhat? That’s\r\nthe bucko that’ll organise her, take my tip. ’Twixt me and you\r\nCaddareesh.\r\n\r\nPride of Calpe’s rocky mount, the ravenhaired daughter of Tweedy. There\r\ngrew she to peerless beauty where loquat and almond scent the air. The\r\ngardens of Alameda knew her step: the garths of olives knew and bowed.\r\nThe chaste spouse of Leopold is she: Marion of the bountiful bosoms.\r\n\r\nAnd lo, there entered one of the clan of the O’Molloy’s, a comely hero\r\nof white face yet withal somewhat ruddy, his majesty’s counsel learned\r\nin the law, and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of\r\nLambert.\r\n\r\n—Hello, Ned.\r\n\r\n—Hello, Alf.\r\n\r\n—Hello, Jack.\r\n\r\n—Hello, Joe.\r\n\r\n—God save you, says the citizen.\r\n\r\n—Save you kindly, says J. J. What’ll it be, Ned?\r\n\r\n—Half one, says Ned.\r\n\r\nSo J. J. ordered the drinks.\r\n\r\n—Were you round at the court? says Joe.\r\n\r\n—Yes, says J. J. He’ll square that, Ned, says he.\r\n\r\n—Hope so, says Ned.\r\n\r\nNow what were those two at? J. J. getting him off the grand jury list\r\nand the other give him a leg over the stile. With his name in Stubbs’s.\r\nPlaying cards, hobnobbing with flash toffs with a swank glass in their\r\neye, adrinking fizz and he half smothered in writs and garnishee\r\norders. Pawning his gold watch in Cummins of Francis street where\r\nno-one would know him in the private office when I was there with\r\nPisser releasing his boots out of the pop. What’s your name, sir?\r\nDunne, says he. Ay, and done says I. Gob, he’ll come home by weeping\r\ncross one of those days, I’m thinking.\r\n\r\n—Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there? says Alf. U. p: up.\r\n\r\n—Yes, says J. J. Looking for a private detective.\r\n\r\n—Ay, says Ned. And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only\r\nCorny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting\r\nexamined first.\r\n\r\n—Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing. God, I’d give anything to\r\nhear him before a judge and jury.\r\n\r\n—Was it you did it, Alf? says Joe. The truth, the whole truth and\r\nnothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.\r\n\r\n—Me? says Alf. Don’t cast your nasturtiums on my character.\r\n\r\n—Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence\r\nagainst you.\r\n\r\n—Of course an action would lie, says J. J. It implies that he is not\r\n_compos mentis_. U. p: up.\r\n\r\n_—Compos_ your eye! says Alf, laughing. Do you know that he’s balmy?\r\nLook at his head. Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat\r\non with a shoehorn.\r\n\r\n—Yes, says J. J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an\r\nindictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law.\r\n\r\n—Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.\r\n\r\n—Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.\r\n\r\n—Pity about her, says the citizen. Or any other woman marries a half\r\nand half.\r\n\r\n—How half and half? says Bloom. Do you mean he...\r\n\r\n—Half and half I mean, says the citizen. A fellow that’s neither fish\r\nnor flesh.\r\n\r\n—Nor good red herring, says Joe.\r\n\r\n—That what’s I mean, says the citizen. A pishogue, if you know what\r\nthat is.\r\n\r\nBegob I saw there was trouble coming. And Bloom explaining he meant on\r\naccount of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old\r\nstuttering fool. Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody\r\npovertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him,\r\nbringing down the rain. And she with her nose cockahoop after she\r\nmarried him because a cousin of his old fellow’s was pewopener to the\r\npope. Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney’s\r\nmoustaches, the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal\r\nZouave to the Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street.\r\nAnd who was he, tell us? A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven\r\nshillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding\r\ndefiance to the world.\r\n\r\n—And moreover, says J. J., a postcard is publication. It was held to be\r\nsufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v. Hole. In my\r\nopinion an action might lie.\r\n\r\nSix and eightpence, please. Who wants your opinion? Let us drink our\r\npints in peace. Gob, we won’t be let even do that much itself.\r\n\r\n—Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.\r\n\r\n—Good health, Ned, says J. J.\r\n\r\n—-There he is again, says Joe.\r\n\r\n—Where? says Alf.\r\n\r\nAnd begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter\r\nand the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in\r\nas they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a\r\nsecondhand coffin.\r\n\r\n—How did that Canada swindle case go off? says Joe.\r\n\r\n—Remanded, says J. J.\r\n\r\nOne of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James\r\nWought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers\r\nsaying he’d give a passage to Canada for twenty bob. What? Do you see\r\nany green in the white of my eye? Course it was a bloody barney. What?\r\nSwindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and\r\nhis own kidney too. J. J. was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew\r\nZaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him,\r\nswearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.\r\n\r\n—Who tried the case? says Joe.\r\n\r\n—Recorder, says Ned.\r\n\r\n—Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.\r\n\r\n—Heart as big as a lion, says Ned. Tell him a tale of woe about arrears\r\nof rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he’ll dissolve\r\nin tears on the bench.\r\n\r\n—Ay, says Alf. Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn’t clap him in the dock\r\nthe other day for suing poor little Gumley that’s minding stones, for\r\nthe corporation there near Butt bridge.\r\n\r\nAnd he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry:\r\n\r\n—A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children?\r\nTen, did you say?\r\n\r\n—Yes, your worship. And my wife has the typhoid.\r\n\r\n—And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court\r\nimmediately, sir. No, sir, I’ll make no order for payment. How dare\r\nyou, sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor\r\nhardworking industrious man! I dismiss the case.\r\n\r\nAnd whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and\r\nin the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity,\r\nthe daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first\r\nquarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the\r\nhalls of law. There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave\r\nhis rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the\r\nprobate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first\r\nchargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and\r\nfinal testamentary disposition _in re_ the real and personal estate of\r\nthe late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus\r\nLivingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another. And to the solemn\r\ncourt of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer. And he sat\r\nhim there about the hour of five o’clock to administer the law of the\r\nbrehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in\r\nand for the county of the city of Dublin. And there sat with him the\r\nhigh sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of\r\nthe tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen\r\nand of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of\r\nFergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the\r\ntribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte\r\nand of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and\r\ntrue. And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should\r\nwell and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined\r\nbetween their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and\r\ntrue verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss\r\nthe book. And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they\r\nswore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His\r\nrightwiseness. And straightway the minions of the law led forth from\r\ntheir donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended\r\nin consequence of information received. And they shackled him hand and\r\nfoot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge\r\nagainst him for he was a malefactor.\r\n\r\n—Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland\r\nfilling the country with bugs.\r\n\r\nSo Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe,\r\ntelling him he needn’t trouble about that little matter till the first\r\nbut if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford. And so Joe swore high\r\nand holy by this and by that he’d do the devil and all.\r\n\r\n—Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have\r\nrepetition. That’s the whole secret.\r\n\r\n—Rely on me, says Joe.\r\n\r\n—Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland. We\r\nwant no more strangers in our house.\r\n\r\n—O, I’m sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom. It’s just that\r\nKeyes, you see.\r\n\r\n—Consider that done, says Joe.\r\n\r\n—Very kind of you, says Bloom.\r\n\r\n—The strangers, says the citizen. Our own fault. We let them come in.\r\nWe brought them in. The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon\r\nrobbers here.\r\n\r\n—Decree _nisi,_ says J. J.\r\n\r\nAnd Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a\r\nspider’s web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling\r\nafter him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite\r\nand when.\r\n\r\n—A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that’s what’s the cause of all\r\nour misfortunes.\r\n\r\n—And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the _Police Gazette_\r\nwith Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.\r\n\r\n—Give us a squint at her, says I.\r\n\r\nAnd what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry borrows\r\noff of Corny Kelleher. Secrets for enlarging your private parts.\r\nMisconduct of society belle. Norman W. Tupper, wealthy Chicago\r\ncontractor, finds pretty but faithless wife in lap of officer Taylor.\r\nBelle in her bloomers misconducting herself, and her fancyman feeling\r\nfor her tickles and Norman W. Tupper bouncing in with his peashooter\r\njust in time to be late after she doing the trick of the loop with\r\nofficer Taylor.\r\n\r\n—O jakers, Jenny, says Joe, how short your shirt is!\r\n\r\n—There’s hair, Joe, says I. Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off\r\nof that one, what?\r\n\r\nSo anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on\r\nhim as long as a late breakfast.\r\n\r\n—Well, says the citizen, what’s the latest from the scene of action?\r\nWhat did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide\r\nabout the Irish language?\r\n\r\nO’Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the\r\npuissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of\r\nthat which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient\r\ncity, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there,\r\nafter due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken\r\nsolemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once\r\nmore into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided\r\nGael.\r\n\r\n—It’s on the march, says the citizen. To hell with the bloody brutal\r\nSassenachs and their _patois._\r\n\r\nSo J. J. puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till\r\nyou heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting\r\nyour blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to\r\nimpeach a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and\r\nbotheration and their colonies and their civilisation.\r\n\r\n—Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen. To hell with them!\r\nThe curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody\r\nthicklugged sons of whores’ gets! No music and no art and no literature\r\nworthy of the name. Any civilisation they have they stole from us.\r\nTonguetied sons of bastards’ ghosts.\r\n\r\n—The European family, says J. J....\r\n\r\n—They’re not European, says the citizen. I was in Europe with Kevin\r\nEgan of Paris. You wouldn’t see a trace of them or their language\r\nanywhere in Europe except in a _cabinet d’aisance._\r\n\r\nAnd says John Wyse:\r\n\r\n—Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.\r\n\r\nAnd says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo:\r\n\r\n—_Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion!_\r\n\r\nHe said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the\r\nmedher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan _Lamh\r\nDearg Abu_, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty\r\nvalorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster\r\nsilent as the deathless gods.\r\n\r\n—What’s up with you, says I to Lenehan. You look like a fellow that had\r\nlost a bob and found a tanner.\r\n\r\n—Gold cup, says he.\r\n\r\n—Who won, Mr Lenehan? says Terry.\r\n\r\n_—Throwaway,_ says he, at twenty to one. A rank outsider. And the rest\r\nnowhere.\r\n\r\n—And Bass’s mare? says Terry.\r\n\r\n—Still running, says he. We’re all in a cart. Boylan plunged two quid\r\non my tip _Sceptre_ for himself and a lady friend.\r\n\r\n—I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on _Zinfandel_ that Mr Flynn\r\ngave me. Lord Howard de Walden’s.\r\n\r\n—Twenty to one, says Lenehan. Such is life in an outhouse. _Throwaway,_\r\nsays he. Takes the biscuit, and talking about bunions. Frailty, thy\r\nname is _Sceptre._\r\n\r\nSo he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was\r\nanything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his\r\nluck with his mangy snout up. Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard.\r\n\r\n—Not there, my child, says he.\r\n\r\n—Keep your pecker up, says Joe. She’d have won the money only for the\r\nother dog.\r\n\r\nAnd J. J. and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom\r\nsticking in an odd word.\r\n\r\n—Some people, says Bloom, can see the mote in others’ eyes but they\r\ncan’t see the beam in their own.\r\n\r\n—_Raimeis_, says the citizen. There’s no-one as blind as the fellow\r\nthat won’t see, if you know what that means. Where are our missing\r\ntwenty millions of Irish should be here today instead of four, our lost\r\ntribes? And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world!\r\nAnd our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax\r\nand our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our\r\ntanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our\r\nHuguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk\r\nand our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite\r\nconvent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world. Where are\r\nthe Greek merchants that came through the pillars of Hercules, the\r\nGibraltar now grabbed by the foe of mankind, with gold and Tyrian\r\npurple to sell in Wexford at the fair of Carmen? Read Tacitus and\r\nPtolemy, even Giraldus Cambrensis. Wine, peltries, Connemara marble,\r\nsilver from Tipperary, second to none, our farfamed horses even today,\r\nthe Irish hobbies, with king Philip of Spain offering to pay customs\r\nduties for the right to fish in our waters. What do the yellowjohns of\r\nAnglia owe us for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths? And the beds\r\nof the Barrow and Shannon they won’t deepen with millions of acres of\r\nmarsh and bog to make us all die of consumption?\r\n\r\n—As treeless as Portugal we’ll be soon, says John Wyse, or Heligoland\r\nwith its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land.\r\nLarches, firs, all the trees of the conifer family are going fast. I\r\nwas reading a report of lord Castletown’s...\r\n\r\n—Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain\r\nelm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage. Save the\r\ntrees of Ireland for the future men of Ireland on the fair hills of\r\nEire, O.\r\n\r\n—Europe has its eyes on you, says Lenehan.\r\n\r\nThe fashionable international world attended _en masse_ this afternoon\r\nat the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief\r\nranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine\r\nValley. Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash,\r\nMrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs\r\nClyde Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss\r\nVirginia Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche\r\nMaple, Mrs Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower,\r\nMiss Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa San, Miss Rachel\r\nCedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall,\r\nMrs Kitty Dewey-Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs\r\nLiana Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of\r\nOakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their presence. The bride who was\r\ngiven away by her father, the M’Conifer of the Glands, looked\r\nexquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised\r\nsilk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of\r\nbroad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe,\r\nthe scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn\r\nbronze. The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce\r\nConifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same\r\ntone, a dainty _motif_ of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a\r\npinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form\r\nof heron feathers of paletinted coral. Senhor Enrique Flor presided at\r\nthe organ with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribed\r\nnumbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement of\r\n_Woodman, spare that tree_ at the conclusion of the service. On leaving\r\nthe church of Saint Fiacre _in Horto_ after the papal blessing the\r\nhappy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts,\r\nbeechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries,\r\nmistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots. Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan\r\nwill spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.\r\n\r\n—And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen. We had our trade with\r\nSpain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were\r\npupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.\r\n\r\n—And will again, says Joe.\r\n\r\n—And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the\r\ncitizen, clapping his thigh. Our harbours that are empty will be full\r\nagain, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom\r\nof Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a\r\nfleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O’Reillys and the\r\nO’Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with\r\nthe emperor Charles the Fifth himself. And will again, says he, when\r\nthe first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own\r\nflag to the fore, none of your Henry Tudor’s harps, no, the oldest flag\r\nafloat, the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns\r\non a blue field, the three sons of Milesius.\r\n\r\nAnd he took the last swig out of the pint. Moya. All wind and piss like\r\na tanyard cat. Cows in Connacht have long horns. As much as his bloody\r\nlife is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled\r\nmultitude in Shanagolden where he daren’t show his nose with the Molly\r\nMaguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the\r\nholding of an evicted tenant.\r\n\r\n—Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse. What will you have?\r\n\r\n—An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.\r\n\r\n—Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up. Terry! Are you\r\nasleep?\r\n\r\n—Yes, sir, says Terry. Small whisky and bottle of Allsop. Right, sir.\r\n\r\nHanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead\r\nof attending to the general public. Picture of a butting match, trying\r\nto crack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his\r\nhead down like a bull at a gate. And another one: _Black Beast Burned\r\nin Omaha, Ga_. A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing\r\nat a Sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under\r\nhim. Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and\r\ncrucify him to make sure of their job.\r\n\r\n—But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at\r\nbay?\r\n\r\n—I’ll tell you what about it, says the citizen. Hell upon earth it is.\r\nRead the revelations that’s going on in the papers about flogging on\r\nthe training ships at Portsmouth. A fellow writes that calls himself\r\n_Disgusted One_.\r\n\r\nSo he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of\r\ntars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the\r\nparson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad\r\nbrought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend\r\nof a gun.\r\n\r\n—A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John\r\nBeresford called it but the modern God’s Englishman calls it caning on\r\nthe breech.\r\n\r\nAnd says John Wyse:\r\n\r\n—’Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.\r\n\r\nThen he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane\r\nand he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad\r\ntill he yells meila murder.\r\n\r\n—That’s your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the\r\nearth. The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary\r\nchamber on the face of God’s earth and their land in the hands of a\r\ndozen gamehogs and cottonball barons. That’s the great empire they\r\nboast about of drudges and whipped serfs.\r\n\r\n—On which the sun never rises, says Joe.\r\n\r\n—And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it. The\r\nunfortunate yahoos believe it.\r\n\r\nThey believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth,\r\nand in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast,\r\nborn of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was\r\nscarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day\r\nhe arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend\r\ntill further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be\r\npaid.\r\n\r\n—But, says Bloom, isn’t discipline the same everywhere. I mean wouldn’t\r\nit be the same here if you put force against force?\r\n\r\nDidn’t I tell you? As true as I’m drinking this porter if he was at his\r\nlast gasp he’d try to downface you that dying was living.\r\n\r\n—We’ll put force against force, says the citizen. We have our greater\r\nIreland beyond the sea. They were driven out of house and home in the\r\nblack 47. Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid\r\nlow by the batteringram and the _Times_ rubbed its hands and told the\r\nwhitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as\r\nredskins in America. Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres. But the\r\nSassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of\r\ncrops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro. Ay,\r\nthey drove out the peasants in hordes. Twenty thousand of them died in\r\nthe coffinships. But those that came to the land of the free remember\r\nthe land of bondage. And they will come again and with a vengeance, no\r\ncravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.\r\n\r\n—Perfectly true, says Bloom. But my point was...\r\n\r\n—We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned. Since the\r\npoor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at\r\nKillala.\r\n\r\n—Ay, says John Wyse. We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us\r\nagainst the Williamites and they betrayed us. Remember Limerick and the\r\nbroken treatystone. We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the\r\nwild geese. Fontenoy, eh? And Sarsfield and O’Donnell, duke of Tetuan\r\nin Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria\r\nTeresa. But what did we ever get for it?\r\n\r\n—The French! says the citizen. Set of dancing masters! Do you know what\r\nit is? They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland. Aren’t they\r\ntrying to make an _Entente cordiale_ now at Tay Pay’s dinnerparty with\r\nperfidious Albion? Firebrands of Europe and they always were.\r\n\r\n—_Conspuez les Français_, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.\r\n\r\n—And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven’t we\r\nhad enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George\r\nthe elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that’s\r\ndead?\r\n\r\nJesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old\r\none with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every\r\nnight of God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman\r\ncarting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by\r\nthe whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about _Ehren on the\r\nRhine_ and come where the boose is cheaper.\r\n\r\n—Well, says J. J. We have Edward the peacemaker now.\r\n\r\n—Tell that to a fool, says the citizen. There’s a bloody sight more pox\r\nthan pax about that boyo. Edward Guelph-Wettin!\r\n\r\n—And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and\r\nbishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic\r\nMajesty’s racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his\r\njockeys rode. The earl of Dublin, no less.\r\n\r\n—They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little\r\nAlf.\r\n\r\nAnd says J. J.:\r\n\r\n—Considerations of space influenced their lordships’ decision.\r\n\r\n—Will you try another, citizen? says Joe.\r\n\r\n—Yes, sir, says he. I will.\r\n\r\n—You? says Joe.\r\n\r\n—Beholden to you, Joe, says I. May your shadow never grow less.\r\n\r\n—Repeat that dose, says Joe.\r\n\r\nBloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with\r\nhis dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n—Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it.\r\nPerpetuating national hatred among nations.\r\n\r\n—But do you know what a nation means? says John Wyse.\r\n\r\n—Yes, says Bloom.\r\n\r\n—What is it? says John Wyse.\r\n\r\n—A nation? says Bloom. A nation is the same people living in the same\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n—By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that’s so I’m a nation for I’m\r\nliving in the same place for the past five years.\r\n\r\nSo of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to\r\nmuck out of it:\r\n\r\n—Or also living in different places.\r\n\r\n—That covers my case, says Joe.\r\n\r\n—What is your nation if I may ask? says the citizen.\r\n\r\n—Ireland, says Bloom. I was born here. Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and,\r\ngob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.\r\n\r\n—After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to\r\nswab himself dry.\r\n\r\n—Here you are, citizen, says Joe. Take that in your right hand and\r\nrepeat after me the following words.\r\n\r\nThe muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth\r\nattributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh,\r\nauthors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and\r\ncalled forth prolonged admiration. No need to dwell on the legendary\r\nbeauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly\r\ndiscern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the\r\nfour masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American\r\npuma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said\r\nin passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill. The\r\nscenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and\r\nraths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive\r\nstones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as\r\nwhen the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy\r\nlong long ago in the time of the Barmecides. Glendalough, the lovely\r\nlakes of Killarney, the ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh\r\nand the Twelve Pins, Ireland’s Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh\r\nPatrick, the brewery of Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company\r\n(Limited), Lough Neagh’s banks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde’s tower, the\r\nMapas obelisk, Sir Patrick Dun’s hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of\r\nAherlow, Lynch’s castle, the Scotch house, Rathdown Union Workhouse at\r\nLoughlinstown, Tullamore jail, Castleconnel rapids,\r\nKilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice, Jury’s Hotel, S.\r\nPatrick’s Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college refectory,\r\nCurley’s hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of Wellington,\r\nthe rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street Warehouse,\r\nFingal’s Cave—all these moving scenes are still there for us today\r\nrendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed\r\nover them and by the rich incrustations of time.\r\n\r\n—Show us over the drink, says I. Which is which?\r\n\r\n—That’s mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.\r\n\r\n—And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted.\r\nAlso now. This very moment. This very instant.\r\n\r\nGob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.\r\n\r\n—Robbed, says he. Plundered. Insulted. Persecuted. Taking what belongs\r\nto us by right. At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold\r\nby auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.\r\n\r\n—Are you talking about the new Jerusalem? says the citizen.\r\n\r\n—I’m talking about injustice, says Bloom.\r\n\r\n—Right, says John Wyse. Stand up to it then with force like men.\r\n\r\nThat’s an almanac picture for you. Mark for a softnosed bullet. Old\r\nlardyface standing up to the business end of a gun. Gob, he’d adorn a\r\nsweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse’s apron on him. And\r\nthen he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as\r\nlimp as a wet rag.\r\n\r\n—But it’s no use, says he. Force, hatred, history, all that. That’s not\r\nlife for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that\r\nit’s the very opposite of that that is really life.\r\n\r\n—What? says Alf.\r\n\r\n—Love, says Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred. I must go now, says\r\nhe to John Wyse. Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is\r\nthere. If he comes just say I’ll be back in a second. Just a moment.\r\n\r\nWho’s hindering you? And off he pops like greased lightning.\r\n\r\n—A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen. Universal love.\r\n\r\n—Well, says John Wyse. Isn’t that what we’re told. Love your neighbour.\r\n\r\n—That chap? says the citizen. Beggar my neighbour is his motto. Love,\r\nmoya! He’s a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.\r\n\r\nLove loves to love love. Nurse loves the new chemist. Constable 14A\r\nloves Mary Kelly. Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle.\r\nM. B. loves a fair gentleman. Li Chi Han lovey up kissy Cha Pu Chow.\r\nJumbo, the elephant, loves Alice, the elephant. Old Mr Verschoyle with\r\nthe ear trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye. The man\r\nin the brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead. His Majesty the King\r\nloves Her Majesty the Queen. Mrs Norman W. Tupper loves officer Taylor.\r\nYou love a certain person. And this person loves that other person\r\nbecause everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.\r\n\r\n—Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song. More power,\r\ncitizen.\r\n\r\n—Hurrah, there, says Joe.\r\n\r\n—The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen.\r\n\r\nAnd he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.\r\n\r\n—We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket.\r\nWhat about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women\r\nand children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text _God is love_\r\npasted round the mouth of his cannon? The bible! Did you read that skit\r\nin the _United Irishman_ today about that Zulu chief that’s visiting\r\nEngland?\r\n\r\n—What’s that? says Joe.\r\n\r\nSo the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts\r\nreading out:\r\n\r\n—A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented\r\nyesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in\r\nWaiting, Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the\r\nheartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in\r\nhis dominions. The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of\r\nwhich the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely\r\ntranslated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod\r\nBarebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the\r\ncordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire,\r\nstating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an\r\nilluminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of\r\nEngland’s greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief\r\nwoman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the\r\naugust hand of the Royal Donor. The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of\r\nfirstshot usquebaugh to the toast _Black and White_ from the skull of\r\nhis immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty\r\nWarts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and\r\nsigned his mark in the visitors’ book, subsequently executing a\r\ncharming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed\r\nseveral knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands.\r\n\r\n—Widow woman, says Ned. I wouldn’t doubt her. Wonder did he put that\r\nbible to the same use as I would.\r\n\r\n—Same only more so, says Lenehan. And thereafter in that fruitful land\r\nthe broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.\r\n\r\n—Is that by Griffith? says John Wyse.\r\n\r\n—No, says the citizen. It’s not signed Shanganagh. It’s only\r\ninitialled: P.\r\n\r\n—And a very good initial too, says Joe.\r\n\r\n—That’s how it’s worked, says the citizen. Trade follows the flag.\r\n\r\n—Well, says J. J., if they’re any worse than those Belgians in the\r\nCongo Free State they must be bad. Did you read that report by a man\r\nwhat’s this his name is?\r\n\r\n—Casement, says the citizen. He’s an Irishman.\r\n\r\n—Yes, that’s the man, says J. J. Raping the women and girls and\r\nflogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they\r\ncan out of them.\r\n\r\n—I know where he’s gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.\r\n\r\n—Who? says I.\r\n\r\n—Bloom, says he. The courthouse is a blind. He had a few bob on\r\n_Throwaway_ and he’s gone to gather in the shekels.\r\n\r\n—Is it that whiteeyed kaffir? says the citizen, that never backed a\r\nhorse in anger in his life?\r\n\r\n—That’s where he’s gone, says Lenehan. I met Bantam Lyons going to back\r\nthat horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip.\r\nBet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on. He’s the\r\nonly man in Dublin has it. A dark horse.\r\n\r\n—He’s a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.\r\n\r\n—Mind, Joe, says I. Show us the entrance out.\r\n\r\n—There you are, says Terry.\r\n\r\nGoodbye Ireland I’m going to Gort. So I just went round the back of the\r\nyard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was\r\nletting off my _(Throwaway_ twenty to) letting off my load gob says I\r\nto myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in\r\nSlattery’s off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings\r\nis five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was\r\ntelling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have\r\ndone about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube _she’s\r\nbetter_ or _she’s_ (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool\r\nif he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!)\r\nIreland my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody\r\n(there’s the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.\r\n\r\nSo anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it\r\nwas Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper\r\nall kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off\r\nof the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk\r\nabout selling Irish industries. Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Gob, that\r\nputs the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show.\r\nGive us a bloody chance. God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody\r\nmouseabout. Mr Bloom with his argol bargol. And his old fellow before\r\nhim perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that\r\npoisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country\r\nwith his baubles and his penny diamonds. Loans by post on easy terms.\r\nAny amount of money advanced on note of hand. Distance no object. No\r\nsecurity. Gob, he’s like Lanty MacHale’s goat that’d go a piece of the\r\nroad with every one.\r\n\r\n—Well, it’s a fact, says John Wyse. And there’s the man now that’ll\r\ntell you all about it, Martin Cunningham.\r\n\r\nSure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power\r\nwith him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the\r\ncollector general’s, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the\r\nregistration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the\r\ncountry at the king’s expense.\r\n\r\nOur travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their\r\npalfreys.\r\n\r\n—Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party.\r\nSaucy knave! To us!\r\n\r\nSo saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.\r\n\r\nMine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.\r\n\r\n—Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.\r\n\r\n—Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked. Look to our steeds.\r\nAnd for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.\r\n\r\n—Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare\r\nlarder. I know not what to offer your lordships.\r\n\r\n—How now, fellow? cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant\r\ncountenance, So servest thou the king’s messengers, master Taptun?\r\n\r\nAn instantaneous change overspread the landlord’s visage.\r\n\r\n—Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly. An you be the king’s\r\nmessengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught. The\r\nking’s friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my\r\nhouse I warrant me.\r\n\r\n—Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty\r\ntrencherman by his aspect. Hast aught to give us?\r\n\r\nMine host bowed again as he made answer:\r\n\r\n—What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of\r\nvenison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog’s bacon, a boar’s\r\nhead with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a\r\nflagon of old Rhenish?\r\n\r\n—Gadzooks! cried the last speaker. That likes me well. Pistachios!\r\n\r\n—Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance. A poor house and a bare\r\nlarder, quotha! ’Tis a merry rogue.\r\n\r\nSo in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.\r\n\r\n—Where is he? says Lenehan. Defrauding widows and orphans.\r\n\r\n—Isn’t that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen\r\nabout Bloom and the Sinn Fein?\r\n\r\n—That’s so, says Martin. Or so they allege.\r\n\r\n—Who made those allegations? says Alf.\r\n\r\n—I, says Joe. I’m the alligator.\r\n\r\n—And after all, says John Wyse, why can’t a jew love his country like\r\nthe next fellow?\r\n\r\n—Why not? says J. J., when he’s quite sure which country it is.\r\n\r\n—Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the\r\nhell is he? says Ned. Or who is he? No offence, Crofton.\r\n\r\n—Who is Junius? says J. J.\r\n\r\n—We don’t want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.\r\n\r\n—He’s a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was\r\nhe drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system. We know\r\nthat in the castle.\r\n\r\n—Isn’t he a cousin of Bloom the dentist? says Jack Power.\r\n\r\n—Not at all, says Martin. Only namesakes. His name was Virag, the\r\nfather’s name that poisoned himself. He changed it by deedpoll, the\r\nfather did.\r\n\r\n—That’s the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen. Island of saints\r\nand sages!\r\n\r\n—Well, they’re still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin. For that\r\nmatter so are we.\r\n\r\n—Yes, says J. J., and every male that’s born they think it may be their\r\nMessiah. And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe,\r\ntill he knows if he’s a father or a mother.\r\n\r\n—Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.\r\n\r\n—O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his\r\nthat died was born. I met him one day in the south city markets buying\r\na tin of Neave’s food six weeks before the wife was delivered.\r\n\r\n—_En ventre sa mère_, says J. J.\r\n\r\n—Do you call that a man? says the citizen.\r\n\r\n—I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.\r\n\r\n—Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.\r\n\r\n—And who does he suspect? says the citizen.\r\n\r\nGob, there’s many a true word spoken in jest. One of those mixed\r\nmiddlings he is. Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a\r\nmonth with headache like a totty with her courses. Do you know what I’m\r\ntelling you? It’d be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like\r\nof that and throw him in the bloody sea. Justifiable homicide, so it\r\nwould. Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of\r\nstuff like a man. Give us your blessing. Not as much as would blind\r\nyour eye.\r\n\r\n—Charity to the neighbour, says Martin. But where is he? We can’t wait.\r\n\r\n—A wolf in sheep’s clothing, says the citizen. That’s what he is. Virag\r\nfrom Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him. Cursed by God.\r\n\r\n—Have you time for a brief libation, Martin? says Ned.\r\n\r\n—Only one, says Martin. We must be quick. J. J. and S.\r\n\r\n—You, Jack? Crofton? Three half ones, Terry.\r\n\r\n—Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us,\r\nsays the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our\r\nshores.\r\n\r\n—Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass. God bless all here is my\r\nprayer.\r\n\r\n—Amen, says the citizen.\r\n\r\n—And I’m sure He will, says Joe.\r\n\r\nAnd at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with\r\nacolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and\r\nsubdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors\r\nand guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto,\r\nCarthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and\r\nVallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines,\r\nPremonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter\r\nNolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet\r\nled by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and\r\nfriars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers,\r\nminimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of\r\nDominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks\r\nof S. Wolstan: and Ignatius his children: and the confraternity of the\r\nchristian brothers led by the reverend brother Edmund Ignatius Rice.\r\nAnd after came all saints and martyrs, virgins and confessors: S. Cyr\r\nand S. Isidore Arator and S. James the Less and S. Phocas of Sinope and\r\nS. Julian Hospitator and S. Felix de Cantalice and S. Simon Stylites\r\nand S. Stephen Protomartyr and S.

John\r\nBerchmans and the saints Gervasius, Servasius and Bonifacius and S.\r\nBride and S. Kieran and S. Canice of Kilkenny and S. Jarlath of Tuam\r\nand S. Finbarr and S. Pappin of Ballymun and Brother Aloysius Pacificus\r\nand Brother Louis Bellicosus and the saints Rose of Lima and of Viterbo\r\nand S. Martha of Bethany and S. Mary of Egypt and S. Lucy and S. Brigid\r\nand S. Attracta and S. Dympna and S. Ita and S. Marion Calpensis and\r\nthe Blessed Sister Teresa of the Child Jesus and S. Barbara and S.\r\nScholastica and S. Ursula with eleven thousand virgins. And all came\r\nwith nimbi and aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords\r\nand olive crowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of\r\ntheir efficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses, fetters, axes,\r\ntrees, bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears, keys,\r\ndragons, lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives,\r\nsoupladles, stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline, bells, crutches,\r\nforceps, stags’ horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a\r\ndish, wax candles, aspergills, unicorns. And as they wended their way\r\nby Nelson’s Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little\r\nBritain street chanting the introit in _Epiphania Domini_ which\r\nbeginneth _Surge, illuminare_ and thereafter most sweetly the gradual\r\n_Omnes_ which saith _de Saba venient_ they did divers wonders such as\r\ncasting out devils, raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes,\r\nhealing the halt and the blind, discovering various articles which had\r\nbeen mislaid, interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and\r\nprophesying. And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the\r\nreverend Father O’Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick. And when the\r\ngood fathers had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard\r\nKiernan and Co, limited, 8, 9 and 10 little Britain street, wholesale\r\ngrocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed for the sale of beer, wine\r\nand spirits for consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the\r\nhouse and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults\r\nand the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and\r\nthe engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the\r\nlintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that\r\nhouse as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and\r\nmake the angels of His light to inhabit therein. And entering he\r\nblessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed\r\nanswered his prayers.\r\n\r\n—_Adiutorium nostrum in nomine Domini._\r\n\r\n—_Qui fecit cœlum et terram._\r\n\r\n—_Dominus vobiscum._\r\n\r\n—_Et cum spiritu tuo._\r\n\r\nAnd he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he\r\nprayed and they all with him prayed:\r\n\r\n—_Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde\r\nsuper creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et\r\nvoluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem\r\nsanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et animæ tutelam Te auctore\r\npercipiat per Christum Dominum nostrum._\r\n\r\n—And so say all of us, says Jack.\r\n\r\n—Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.\r\n\r\n—Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson. And butter for fish.\r\n\r\nI was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike\r\nwhen be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a\r\nhurry.\r\n\r\n—I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you. I hope\r\nI’m not...\r\n\r\n—No, says Martin, we’re ready.\r\n\r\nCourthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver.\r\nMean bloody scut. Stand us a drink itself. Devil a sweet fear! There’s\r\na jew for you! All for number one. Cute as a shithouse rat. Hundred to\r\nfive.\r\n\r\n—Don’t tell anyone, says the citizen.\r\n\r\n—Beg your pardon, says he.\r\n\r\n—Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue. Come along now.\r\n\r\n—Don’t tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him. It’s a\r\nsecret.\r\n\r\nAnd the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.\r\n\r\n—Bye bye all, says Martin.\r\n\r\nAnd he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or\r\nwhatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be\r\nall at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car.\r\n\r\n—Off with you, says Martin to the jarvey.\r\n\r\nThe milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop\r\nthe helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off\r\nforward with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard. A many comely\r\nnymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the\r\nsides of the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the\r\ncunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the\r\nequidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds\r\nthem all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas\r\nthey ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair. Even so\r\ndid they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters.\r\nAnd they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark\r\nclave the waves.\r\n\r\nBut begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the\r\ncitizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the\r\ndropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and\r\ncandle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little\r\nAlf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.\r\n\r\n—Let me alone, says he.\r\n\r\nAnd begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls\r\nout of him:\r\n\r\n—Three cheers for Israel!\r\n\r\nArrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ’ sake\r\nand don’t be making a public exhibition of yourself. Jesus, there’s\r\nalways some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about\r\nbloody nothing. Gob, it’d turn the porter sour in your guts, so it\r\nwould.\r\n\r\nAnd all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and\r\nMartin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and\r\nAlf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews\r\nand the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him\r\nto sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a\r\npatch over his eye starts singing _If the man in the moon was a jew,\r\njew, jew_ and a slut shouts out of her:\r\n\r\n—Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister!\r\n\r\nAnd says he:\r\n\r\n—Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza. And\r\nthe Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew. Your God.\r\n\r\n—He had no father, says Martin. That’ll do now. Drive ahead.\r\n\r\n—Whose God? says the citizen.\r\n\r\n—Well, his uncle was a jew, says he. Your God was a jew. Christ was a\r\njew like me.\r\n\r\nGob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.\r\n\r\n—By Jesus, says he, I’ll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy\r\nname. By Jesus, I’ll crucify him so I will. Give us that biscuitbox here.\r\n\r\n—Stop! Stop! says Joe.\r\n\r\nA large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from\r\nthe metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid\r\nfarewell to Nagyaságos uram Lipóti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander\r\nThom’s, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for\r\nthe distant clime of Százharminczbrojúgulyás-Dugulás (Meadow of\r\nMurmuring Waters). The ceremony which went off with great _éclat_ was\r\ncharacterised by the most affecting cordiality. An illuminated scroll\r\nof ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to\r\nthe distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the\r\ncommunity and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket,\r\ntastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work\r\nwhich reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob _agus_ Jacob.\r\nThe departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of\r\nthose who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of\r\nIrish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of _Come Back to Erin_,\r\nfollowed immediately by _Rakóczsy’s March_. Tarbarrels and bonfires\r\nwere lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the\r\nHill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains\r\nof Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the\r\nNagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of\r\nM’Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom. Amid\r\ncheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a\r\nbig muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills,\r\nthe mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final\r\nfloral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were\r\npresent in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river,\r\nescorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and\r\nCustom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical\r\npower station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light.\r\n_Visszontlátásra, kedvés barátom! Visszontlátásra!_ Gone but not\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nGob, the devil wouldn’t stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin\r\nanyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he\r\nshouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen’s\r\nroyal theatre:\r\n\r\n—Where is he till I murder him?\r\n\r\nAnd Ned and J. J. paralysed with the laughing.\r\n\r\n—Bloody wars, says I, I’ll be in for the last gospel.\r\n\r\nBut as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag’s head round the other\r\nway and off with him.\r\n\r\n—Hold on, citizen, says Joe. Stop!\r\n\r\nBegob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly. Mercy of God the\r\nsun was in his eyes or he’d have left him for dead. Gob, he near sent\r\nit into the county Longford. The bloody nag took fright and the old\r\nmongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting\r\nand laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street.\r\n\r\nThe catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. The\r\nobservatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the\r\nfifth grade of Mercalli’s scale, and there is no record extant of a\r\nsimilar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534,\r\nthe year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas. The epicentre appears to\r\nhave been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn’s Quay\r\nward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres,\r\ntwo roods and one square pole or perch. All the lordly residences in\r\nthe vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble\r\nedifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal\r\ndebates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it\r\nis to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive. From the\r\nreports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were\r\naccompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic\r\ncharacter. An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the\r\nmuch respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a\r\nsilk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat\r\nof arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of\r\nquarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been\r\ndiscovered by search parties in remote parts of the island\r\nrespectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant’s\r\ncauseway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in\r\nthe sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale. Other\r\neyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of\r\nenormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying\r\nvelocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west. Messages of\r\ncondolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the\r\ndifferent continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously\r\npleased to decree that a special _missa pro defunctis_ shall be\r\ncelebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral\r\nchurch of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority\r\nof the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who\r\nhave been so unexpectedly called away from our midst. The work of\r\nsalvage, removal of _débris,_ human remains etc has been entrusted to\r\nMessrs Michael Meade and Son, 159 Great Brunswick street, and Messrs T.\r\nand C. Martin, 77, 78, 79 and 80 North Wall, assisted by the men and\r\nofficers of the Duke of Cornwall’s light infantry under the general\r\nsupervision of H. R. H., rear admiral, the right honourable sir\r\nHercules Hannibal Habeas Corpus Anderson, K. G., K. P., K. T., P. C.,\r\nK. C. B., M. P., J. P., M. B., D. S. O., S. O. D., M. F. H., M. R. I.\r\nA., B.

      "content": "You never saw the like of it in all your born puff. Gob, if he got that\r\nlottery ticket on the side of his poll he’d remember the gold cup, he\r\nwould so, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and\r\nbattery and Joe for aiding and abetting. The jarvey saved his life by\r\nfurious driving as sure as God made Moses. What? O, Jesus, he did. And\r\nhe let a volley of oaths after him.\r\n\r\n—Did I kill him, says he, or what?\r\n\r\nAnd he shouting to the bloody dog:\r\n\r\n—After him, Garry! After him, boy!\r\n\r\nAnd the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old\r\nsheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his\r\nlugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb.\r\nHundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nWhen, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld\r\nthe chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven. And they beheld Him in\r\nthe chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having\r\nraiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they\r\ndurst not look upon Him. And there came a voice out of heaven, calling:\r\n_Elijah! Elijah!_ And He answered with a main cry: _Abba! Adonai!_ And\r\nthey beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels\r\nascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees\r\nover Donohoe’s in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel.\r\n\n[ 13 ]\r\n\nThe summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious\r\nembrace. Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of\r\nall too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud\r\npromontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on\r\nthe weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on\r\nthe quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the\r\nstillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a\r\nbeacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening\r\nscene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly. Many a time and\r\noft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy\r\nchat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy\r\nCaffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and\r\nJacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits\r\nwith caps to match and the name _H. M. S. Belleisle_ printed on both.\r\nFor Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very\r\nnoisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little\r\nfellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them. They\r\nwere dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets, building\r\ncastles as children do, or playing with their big coloured ball, happy\r\nas the day was long. And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to\r\nand fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with\r\ndelight. He was but eleven months and nine days old and, though still a\r\ntiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words. Cissy\r\nCaffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty\r\ndimple in his chin.\r\n\r\n—Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said. Say out big, big. I want a drink of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nAnd baby prattled after her:\r\n\r\n—A jink a jink a jawbo.\r\n\r\nCissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of\r\nchildren, so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could\r\nnever be got to take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that\r\nheld his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown\r\nbread with golden syrup on. What a persuasive power that girl had! But\r\nto be sure baby Boardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in\r\nhis new fancy bib. None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort,\r\nwas Cissy Caffrey. A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life,\r\nalways with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her\r\ncherryripe red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme. And Edy Boardman\r\nlaughed too at the quaint language of little brother.\r\n\r\nBut just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and\r\nMaster Jacky. Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to\r\nthis golden rule. The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand\r\nwhich Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go\r\nwrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like\r\nthe Martello tower had. But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky\r\nwas selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman’s\r\nhouse is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose\r\nthat the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the\r\ncoveted castle too. Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master\r\nTommy drew the attention of the girl friends.\r\n\r\n—Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively. At once! And you,\r\nJacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand. Wait till I\r\ncatch you for that.\r\n\r\nHis eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for\r\ntheir big sister’s word was law with the twins. And in a sad plight he\r\nwas too after his misadventure. His little man-o’-war top and\r\nunmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the\r\nart of smoothing over life’s tiny troubles and very quickly not one\r\nspeck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit. Still the blue\r\neyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed\r\naway the hurtness and shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and\r\nsaid if she was near him she wouldn’t be far from him, her eyes dancing\r\nin admonition.\r\n\r\n—Nasty bold Jacky! she cried.\r\n\r\nShe put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:\r\n\r\n—What’s your name? Butter and cream?\r\n\r\n—Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman. Is Cissy your\r\nsweetheart?\r\n\r\n—Nao, tearful Tommy said.\r\n\r\n—Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart? Cissy queried.\r\n\r\n—Nao, Tommy said.\r\n\r\n—I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from\r\nher shortsighted eyes. I know who is Tommy’s sweetheart. Gerty is\r\nTommy’s sweetheart.\r\n\r\n—Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.\r\n\r\nCissy’s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy\r\nBoardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman\r\ncouldn’t see and to mind he didn’t wet his new tan shoes.\r\n\r\nBut who was Gerty?\r\n\r\nGerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought,\r\ngazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a\r\nspecimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see. She was\r\npronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said,\r\nshe was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell. Her figure was slight and\r\ngraceful, inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had\r\nbeen taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the\r\nWidow Welch’s female pills and she was much better of those discharges\r\nshe used to get and that tired feeling. The waxen pallor of her face\r\nwas almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth\r\nwas a genuine Cupid’s bow, Greekly perfect. Her hands were of finely\r\nveined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and\r\nqueen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used\r\nto wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either. Bertha Supple\r\ntold that once to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black\r\nout at daggers drawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their\r\nlittle tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told\r\nher not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or\r\nshe’d never speak to her again. No. Honour where honour is due. There\r\nwas an innate refinement, a languid queenly _hauteur_ about Gerty which\r\nwas unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep.\r\nHad kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in\r\nher own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education\r\nGerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the\r\nland and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow\r\nand patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their\r\ndevoirs to her. Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that\r\nlent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed\r\nmeaning, that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful\r\neyes, a charm few could resist. Why have women such eyes of witchery?\r\nGerty’s were of the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and\r\ndark expressive brows. Time was when those brows were not so silkily\r\nseductive. It was Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful\r\npage of the Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try\r\neyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so\r\nbecoming in leaders of fashion, and she had never regretted it. Then\r\nthere was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase\r\nyour height and you have a beautiful face but your nose? That would\r\nsuit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one. But Gerty’s crowning\r\nglory was her wealth of wonderful hair. It was dark brown with a\r\nnatural wave in it. She had cut it that very morning on account of the\r\nnew moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of\r\nluxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth. And\r\njust now at Edy’s words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest\r\nrosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet\r\ngirlish shyness that of a surety God’s fair land of Ireland did not\r\nhold her equal.\r\n\r\nFor an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes. She was\r\nabout to retort but something checked the words on her tongue.\r\nInclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent.\r\nThe pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out\r\ninto a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young\r\nMay morning. She knew right well, no-one better, what made squinty Edy\r\nsay that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a\r\nlovers’ quarrel. As per usual somebody’s nose was out of joint about\r\nthe boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding\r\nup and down in front of her window. Only now his father kept him in in\r\nthe evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate\r\nthat was on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a\r\ndoctor when he left the high school like his brother W. E. Wylie who\r\nwas racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university. Little\r\nrecked he perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart\r\nsometimes, piercing to the core. Yet he was young and perchance he\r\nmight learn to love her in time. They were protestants in his family\r\nand of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed\r\nVirgin and then Saint Joseph. But he was undeniably handsome with an\r\nexquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the\r\nshape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would\r\nknow anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the\r\nbicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice\r\nperfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size\r\ntoo he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so\r\nfrightfully clever because he didn’t go and ride up and down in front\r\nof her bit of a garden.\r\n\r\nGerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of\r\nDame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be\r\nout. A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because\r\nit was expected in the _Lady’s Pictorial_ that electric blue would be\r\nworn) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket\r\n(in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her\r\nfavourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy\r\nthreequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful\r\nfigure to perfection. She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of\r\nwideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue\r\nchenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone. All Tuesday\r\nweek afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she\r\nfound what she wanted at Clery’s summer sales, the very it, slightly\r\nshopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny.\r\nShe did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on\r\nthen, smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to\r\nher! And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew\r\nthat that would take the shine out of some people she knew. Her shoes\r\nwere the newest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she\r\nwas very _petite_ but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a\r\nfive, and never would ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one\r\nsmart buckle over her higharched instep. Her wellturned ankle displayed\r\nits perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount\r\nand no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with\r\nhighspliced heels and wide garter tops. As for undies they were Gerty’s\r\nchief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet\r\nseventeen (though Gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in\r\nhis heart to blame her? She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty\r\nstitchery, three garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with\r\ndifferent coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen,\r\nand she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the\r\nwash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because\r\nshe wouldn’t trust those washerwomen as far as she’d see them scorching\r\nthe things. She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her\r\nown colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on\r\nher because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his\r\nfather brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and\r\nbecause she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was\r\ndressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside\r\nout and that was for luck and lovers’ meeting if you put those things\r\non inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so\r\nlong as it wasn’t of a Friday.\r\n\r\nAnd yet and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is\r\nthere all the time. Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give\r\nworlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving\r\nway to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings\r\nthough not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the\r\nmirror. You are lovely, Gerty, it said. The paly light of evening falls\r\nupon a face infinitely sad and wistful. Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain.\r\nYes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage\r\nhas been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T.\r\nC. D. (because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs\r\nWylie) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was\r\nwearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox\r\nwas not to be. He was too young to understand. He would not believe in\r\nlove, a woman’s birthright. The night of the party long ago in Stoer’s\r\n(he was still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an\r\narm round her waist she went white to the very lips. He called her\r\nlittle one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the\r\nfirst!) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from\r\nthe room with a remark about refreshments. Impetuous fellow! Strength\r\nof character had never been Reggy Wylie’s strong point and he who would\r\nwoo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men. But waiting,\r\nalways waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be\r\nover. No prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous\r\nlove at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who\r\nhad not found his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey,\r\nand who would understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her\r\nto him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort\r\nher with a long long kiss. It would be like heaven. For such a one she\r\nyearns this balmy summer eve. With all the heart of her she longs to be\r\nhis only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in\r\nhealth, till death us two part, from this to this day forward.\r\n\r\nAnd while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was\r\njust thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his\r\nlittle wife to be. Then they could talk about her till they went blue\r\nin the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she\r\nwould be twentytwo in November. She would care for him with creature\r\ncomforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked\r\nthat feeling of hominess. Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue\r\nand queen Ann’s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden\r\nopinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a\r\nfire, dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same\r\ndirection, then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of\r\neggs though she didn’t like the eating part when there were any people\r\nthat made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn’t eat something\r\npoetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully\r\nappointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph\r\nof grandpapa Giltrap’s lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was\r\nso human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in\r\nClery’s summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses. He would be\r\ntall with broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a\r\nhusband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed\r\nsweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their\r\nhoneymoon (three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settled down in\r\na nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning they would both\r\nhave brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own two selves and\r\nbefore he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a\r\ngood hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes.\r\n\r\nEdy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then\r\nshe buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run\r\noff and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight. But Tommy\r\nsaid he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with\r\nthe ball and if he took it there’d be wigs on the green but Tommy said\r\nit was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if\r\nyou please. The temper of him! O, he was a man already was little Tommy\r\nCaffrey since he was out of pinnies. Edy told him no, no and to be off\r\nnow with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.\r\n\r\n—You’re not my sister, naughty Tommy said. It’s my ball.\r\n\r\nBut Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her\r\nfinger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand\r\nand Tommy after it in full career, having won the day.\r\n\r\n—Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.\r\n\r\nAnd she tickled tiny tot’s two cheeks to make him forget and played\r\nhere’s the lord mayor, here’s his two horses, here’s his gingerbread\r\ncarriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper\r\nchin. But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way\r\nlike that from everyone always petting him.\r\n\r\n—I’d like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won’t\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n—On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.\r\n\r\nGerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy\r\nsaying an unladylike thing like that out loud she’d be ashamed of her\r\nlife to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was\r\nsure the gentleman opposite heard what she said. But not a pin cared\r\nCiss.\r\n\r\n—Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of\r\nher nose. Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I’d look at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMadcap Ciss with her golliwog curls. You had to laugh at her sometimes.\r\nFor instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea\r\nand jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men’s faces on\r\nher nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to\r\ngo where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the\r\nMiss White. That was just like Cissycums. O, and will you ever forget\r\nher the evening she dressed up in her father’s suit and hat and the\r\nburned cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a\r\ncigarette. There was none to come up to her for fun. But she was\r\nsincerity itself, one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever\r\nmade, not one of your twofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome.\r\n\r\nAnd then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the\r\npealing anthem of the organ. It was the men’s temperance retreat\r\nconducted by the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S. J., rosary,\r\nsermon and benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament. They were there\r\ngathered together without distinction of social class (and a most\r\nedifying spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves,\r\nafter the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the\r\nimmaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her\r\nto intercede for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin\r\nof virgins. How sad to poor Gerty’s ears! Had her father only avoided\r\nthe clutches of the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders\r\nthe drink habit cured in Pearson’s Weekly, she might now be rolling in\r\nher carriage, second to none. Over and over had she told herself that\r\nas she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp\r\nbecause she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window\r\ndreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking.\r\nBut that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had\r\ncast its shadow over her childhood days. Nay, she had even witnessed in\r\nthe home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen\r\nher own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget himself\r\ncompletely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it\r\nwas that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of\r\nkindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low.\r\n\r\nAnd still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful,\r\nVirgin most merciful. And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard\r\nher companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman\r\noff Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like\r\nhimself passing along the strand taking a short walk. You never saw him\r\nany way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a\r\nfather because he was too old or something or on account of his face\r\n(it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the\r\npimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose. Poor\r\nfather! With all his faults she loved him still when he sang _Tell me,\r\nMary, how to woo thee_ or _My love and cottage near Rochelle_ and they\r\nhad stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby’s salad dressing for supper\r\nand when he sang _The moon hath raised_ with Mr Dignam that died\r\nsuddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke. Her\r\nmother’s birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom\r\nand Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have\r\nhad a group taken. No-one would have thought the end was so near. Now\r\nhe was laid to rest. And her mother said to him to let that be a\r\nwarning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn’t even go to the\r\nfuneral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him\r\nthe letters and samples from his office about Catesby’s cork lino,\r\nartistic, standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and\r\nalways bright and cheery in the home.\r\n\r\nA sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the\r\nhouse, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in\r\ngold. And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was\r\nit rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn’t\r\nlike her mother’s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single\r\nthing they ever had words about, taking snuff. Everyone thought the\r\nworld of her for her gentle ways. It was Gerty who turned off the gas\r\nat the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of\r\nthat place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime\r\nMr Tunney the grocer’s christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days\r\nwhere a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a\r\nthreecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with\r\noldtime chivalry through her lattice window. You could see there was a\r\nstory behind it. The colours were done something lovely. She was in a\r\nsoft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in\r\nchocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat. She often looked at them\r\ndreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own\r\narms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and\r\nthought about those times because she had found out in Walker’s\r\npronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the\r\nhalcyon days what they meant.\r\n\r\nThe twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till\r\nat last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no\r\ngetting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he\r\ncould down towards the seaweedy rocks. Needless to say poor Tommy was\r\nnot slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was\r\nsitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted\r\nthe ball. Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries\r\nand to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it\r\nto her please. The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then\r\nthrew it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the\r\nslope and stopped right under Gerty’s skirt near the little pool by the\r\nrock. The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it\r\naway and let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she\r\nwished their stupid ball hadn’t come rolling down to her and she gave a\r\nkick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.\r\n\r\n—If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.\r\n\r\nGerty smiled assent and bit her lip. A delicate pink crept into her\r\npretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted\r\nher skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball\r\na jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it\r\ndown towards the shingle. Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else\r\nto draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking. She\r\nfelt the warm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell,\r\nsurging and flaming into her cheeks. Till then they had only exchanged\r\nglances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she\r\nventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the\r\ntwilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had\r\never seen.\r\n\r\nThrough the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted\r\nand with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain\r\nof original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray\r\nfor us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose. And\r\ncareworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many\r\nwho had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all\r\nthat bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told\r\nthem what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary,\r\nthe most pious Virgin’s intercessory power that it was not recorded in\r\nany age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever\r\nabandoned by her.\r\n\r\nThe twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of\r\nchildhood are but as fleeting summer showers. Cissy Caffrey played with\r\nbaby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air.\r\nPeep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was\r\nCissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my\r\nword, didn’t the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say\r\npapa.\r\n\r\n—Say papa, baby. Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.\r\n\r\nAnd baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for\r\neleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of\r\nhealth, a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out\r\nto be something great, they said.\r\n\r\n—Haja ja ja haja.\r\n\r\nCissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to\r\nsit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried\r\nout, holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half\r\nblanket the other way under him. Of course his infant majesty was most\r\nobstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it:\r\n\r\n—Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.\r\n\r\nAnd two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks. It was all\r\nno use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the\r\ngeegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave\r\nhim in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen\r\nwas quickly appeased.\r\n\r\nGerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out\r\nof that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little\r\nbrats of twins. She gazed out towards the distant sea. It was like the\r\npaintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured\r\nchalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out,\r\nthe evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and\r\nto hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they\r\nburned in the church like a kind of waft. And while she gazed her heart\r\nwent pitapat. Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning\r\nin his look. His eyes burned into her as though they would search her\r\nthrough and through, read her very soul. Wonderful eyes they were,\r\nsuperbly expressive, but could you trust them? People were so queer.\r\nShe could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face\r\nthat he was a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin\r\nHarvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred\r\nbecause she wasn’t stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they\r\ntwo to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see\r\nwhether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly _retroussé_ from where he\r\nwas sitting. He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story\r\nof a haunting sorrow was written on his face. She would have given\r\nworlds to know what it was. He was looking up so intently, so still,\r\nand he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel\r\nbuckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the\r\ntoes down. She was glad that something told her to put on the\r\ntransparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was\r\nfar away. Here was that of which she had so often dreamed. It was he\r\nwho mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him\r\nbecause she felt instinctively that he was like no-one else. The very\r\nheart of the girlwoman went out to him, her dreamhusband, because she\r\nknew on the instant it was him. If he had suffered, more sinned against\r\nthan sinning, or even, even, if he had been himself a sinner, a wicked\r\nman, she cared not. Even if he was a protestant or methodist she could\r\nconvert him easily if he truly loved her. There were wounds that wanted\r\nhealing with heartbalm. She was a womanly woman not like other flighty\r\ngirls unfeminine he had known, those cyclists showing off what they\r\nhadn’t got and she just yearned to know all, to forgive all if she\r\ncould make him fall in love with her, make him forget the memory of the\r\npast. Then mayhap he would embrace her gently, like a real man,\r\ncrushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownest girlie, for\r\nherself alone.\r\n\r\nRefuge of sinners. Comfortress of the afflicted. _Ora pro nobis_. Well\r\nhas it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy\r\ncan never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge\r\nfor the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her\r\nown heart. Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the\r\nstained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue\r\nbanners of the blessed Virgin’s sodality and Father Conroy was helping\r\nCanon O’Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes\r\ncast down. He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet\r\nand clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever\r\nshe became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come\r\nto the convent for the novena of Saint Dominic. He told her that time\r\nwhen she told him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots\r\nof her hair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was\r\nonly the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature’s laws, he\r\nsaid, in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the\r\nnature of woman instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady\r\nherself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to\r\nThy Word. He was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and\r\nthought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design\r\nfor him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the\r\nmantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little\r\nhouse to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the\r\nforty hours’ adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a\r\npresent to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or\r\nsome place.\r\n\r\nThe exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky\r\nthrew the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it. Little\r\nmonkeys common as ditchwater. Someone ought to take them and give them\r\na good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of\r\nthem. And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they\r\nwere afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.\r\n\r\n—Jacky! Tommy!\r\n\r\nNot they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very\r\nlast time she’d ever bring them out. She jumped up and called them and\r\nshe ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had\r\na good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the\r\nthingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn’t get it to grow\r\nlong because it wasn’t natural so she could just go and throw her hat\r\nat it. She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn’t rip\r\nup her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a\r\nlot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece\r\nwhenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just\r\nbecause she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see\r\nall the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as\r\npossible. It would have served her just right if she had tripped up\r\nover something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French\r\nheels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble. _Tableau!_\r\nThat would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that\r\nto witness.\r\n\r\nQueen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints,\r\nthey prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy\r\nhanded the thurible to Canon O’Hanlon and he put in the incense and\r\ncensed the Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and\r\nshe was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she\r\ndidn’t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a\r\nbigger mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking\r\nthat he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O’Hanlon handed\r\nthe thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the\r\nBlessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing the _Tantum ergo_ and she\r\njust swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to\r\nthe _Tantumer gosa cramen tum_. Three and eleven she paid for those\r\nstockings in Sparrow’s of George’s street on the Tuesday, no the Monday\r\nbefore Easter and there wasn’t a brack on them and that was what he was\r\nlooking at, transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had\r\nneither shape nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his\r\nhead to see the difference for himself.\r\n\r\nCissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with\r\nher hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a\r\nstreel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought\r\nonly a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her\r\npetticoat hanging like a caricature. Gerty just took off her hat for a\r\nmoment to settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown\r\ntresses was never seen on a girl’s shoulders—a radiant little vision,\r\nin sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness. You would have to travel\r\nmany a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that. She\r\ncould almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes\r\nthat set her tingling in every nerve. She put on her hat so that she\r\ncould see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster\r\nfor her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes. He was\r\neying her as a snake eyes its prey. Her woman’s instinct told her that\r\nshe had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet\r\nswept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a\r\nglorious rose.\r\n\r\nEdy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty,\r\nhalf smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the\r\nbaby. Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was\r\nwhy no-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no\r\nconcern of hers. And she said to Gerty:\r\n\r\n—A penny for your thoughts.\r\n\r\n—What? replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth. I\r\nwas only wondering was it late.\r\n\r\nBecause she wished to goodness they’d take the snottynosed twins and\r\ntheir babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just\r\ngave a gentle hint about its being late. And when Cissy came up Edy\r\nasked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was\r\nhalf past kissing time, time to kiss again. But Edy wanted to know\r\nbecause they were told to be in early.\r\n\r\n—Wait, said Cissy, I’ll run ask my uncle Peter over there what’s the\r\ntime by his conundrum.\r\n\r\nSo over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his\r\nhand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his\r\nwatchchain, looking up at the church. Passionate nature though he was\r\nGerty could see that he had enormous control over himself. One moment\r\nhe had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and\r\nthe next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol\r\nexpressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.\r\n\r\nCissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the\r\nright time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to\r\nit and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry\r\nhis watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the\r\nsun was set. His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in\r\nmeasured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones.\r\nCissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said\r\nhis waterworks were out of order.\r\n\r\nThen they sang the second verse of the _Tantum ergo_ and Canon O’Hanlon\r\ngot up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he\r\ntold Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire\r\nto the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and\r\nshe could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the\r\nworks and she swung her leg more in and out in time. It was getting\r\ndarker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was\r\nwinding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it\r\nback and put his hands back into his pockets. She felt a kind of a\r\nsensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp\r\nand that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on\r\nbecause the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of\r\nthe moon. His dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her\r\nevery contour, literally worshipping at her shrine. If ever there was\r\nundisguised admiration in a man’s passionate gaze it was there plain to\r\nbe seen on that man’s face. It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you\r\nknow it.\r\n\r\nEdy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty\r\nnoticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect\r\nbecause it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place\r\nto push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins’ caps and tidied\r\ntheir hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O’Hanlon\r\nstood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed\r\nhim the card to read off and he read out _Panem de coelo praestitisti\r\neis_ and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and\r\nasking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just\r\nanswered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she\r\nheartbroken about her best boy throwing her over. Gerty winced sharply.\r\nA brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn\r\nimmeasurable. It hurt—O yes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet\r\nway of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded\r\nlittle cat she was. Gerty’s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but\r\nshe fought back the sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless,\r\nso beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of.\r\nShe had loved him better than he knew. Lighthearted deceiver and fickle\r\nlike all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and\r\nfor an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears.\r\nTheir eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she\r\nsparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them\r\nto see.\r\n\r\n—O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head\r\nflashed up. I can throw my cap at who I like because it’s leap year.\r\n\r\nHer words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the\r\nringdove, but they cut the silence icily. There was that in her young\r\nvoice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with. As\r\nfor Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck\r\nhim aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as\r\nmuch as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a\r\ndozen pieces. And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him\r\none look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot.\r\nMiss puny little Edy’s countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty\r\ncould see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a\r\ntowering rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft\r\nhad struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was\r\nsomething aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and\r\nnever would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it\r\nso they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.\r\n\r\nEdy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked\r\nin the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because\r\nthe sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior. And Cissy told\r\nhim too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and\r\nbaby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and\r\nCissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby,\r\nwithout as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and\r\nsundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib.\r\n\r\n—O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss. He has his bib destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe slight _contretemps_ claimed her attention but in two twos she set\r\nthat little matter to rights.\r\n\r\nGerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy\r\nasked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was\r\nflying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed\r\nit off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction\r\nbecause just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet\r\nseashore because Canon O’Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that\r\nFather Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the\r\nBlessed Sacrament in his hands.\r\n\r\nHow moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse\r\nof Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time\r\na bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither,\r\nthither, with a tiny lost cry. And she could see far away the lights of\r\nthe lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of\r\npaints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the\r\nlamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church\r\ngrounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked\r\nand lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn\r\nhis freewheel like she read in that book _The Lamplighter_ by Miss\r\nCummins, author of _Mabel Vaughan_ and other tales. For Gerty had her\r\ndreams that no-one knew of. She loved to read poetry and when she got a\r\nkeepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the\r\ncoralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of\r\nher toilettable which, though it did not err on the side of luxury, was\r\nscrupulously neat and clean. It was there she kept her girlish treasure\r\ntrove, the tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose\r\nscent, the eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to\r\nchange when her things came home from the wash and there were some\r\nbeautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in\r\nHely’s of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if\r\nshe could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so\r\ndeeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening\r\nround the potherbs. _Art thou real, my ideal?_ it was called by Louis J\r\nWalsh, Magherafelt, and after there was something about _twilight, wilt\r\nthou ever?_ and ofttimes the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient\r\nloveliness, had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the\r\nyears were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one\r\nshortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an\r\naccident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it.\r\nBut it must end, she felt. If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there\r\nwould be no holding back for her. Love laughs at locksmiths. She would\r\nmake the great sacrifice. Her every effort would be to share his\r\nthoughts. Dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his\r\ndays with happiness. There was the allimportant question and she was\r\ndying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife\r\nor some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land\r\nof song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind. But\r\neven if—what then? Would it make a very great difference? From\r\neverything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively\r\nrecoiled. She loathed that sort of person, the fallen women off the\r\naccommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and\r\ncoarse men with no respect for a girl’s honour, degrading the sex and\r\nbeing taken up to the police station. No, no: not that. They would be\r\njust good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other\r\nin spite of the conventions of Society with a big ess. Perhaps it was\r\nan old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall. She\r\nthought she understood. She would try to understand him because men\r\nwere so different. The old love was waiting, waiting with little white\r\nhands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes. Heart of mine! She would\r\nfollow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart that told her he\r\nwas her all in all, the only man in all the world for her for love was\r\nthe master guide. Nothing else mattered. Come what might she would be\r\nwild, untrammelled, free.\r\n\r\nCanon O’Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and\r\ngenuflected and the choir sang _Laudate Dominum omnes gentes_ and then\r\nhe locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and\r\nFather Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked\r\nwasn’t she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out:\r\n\r\n—O, look, Cissy!\r\n\r\nAnd they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over\r\nthe trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.\r\n\r\n—It’s fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.\r\n\r\nAnd they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church,\r\nhelterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy\r\nholding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn’t fall running.\r\n\r\n—Come on, Gerty, Cissy called. It’s the bazaar fireworks.\r\n\r\nBut Gerty was adamant. She had no intention of being at their beck and\r\ncall. If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she\r\ncould see from where she was. The eyes that were fastened upon her set\r\nher pulses tingling. She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance,\r\nand a light broke in upon her. Whitehot passion was in that face,\r\npassion silent as the grave, and it had made her his. At last they were\r\nleft alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he\r\ncould be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of\r\ninflexible honour to his fingertips. His hands and face were working\r\nand a tremour went over her. She leaned back far to look up where the\r\nfireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall\r\nback looking up and there was no-one to see only him and her when she\r\nrevealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply\r\nsoft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his\r\nheart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew too about the passion of\r\nmen like that, hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead\r\nsecret and made her swear she’d never about the gentleman lodger that\r\nwas staying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had\r\npictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and\r\nshe said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine\r\nsometimes in the bed. But this was altogether different from a thing\r\nlike that because there was all the difference because she could almost\r\nfeel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his\r\nhandsome lips. Besides there was absolution so long as you didn’t do\r\nthe other thing before being married and there ought to be women\r\npriests that would understand without your telling out and Cissy\r\nCaffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes\r\nso that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham so mad about actors’\r\nphotographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on\r\nthe way it did.\r\n\r\nAnd Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned\r\nback and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent\r\nand they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was\r\nand she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something\r\nqueer was flying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark. And\r\nshe saw a long Roman candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in\r\nthe tense hush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went\r\nhigher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up\r\nafter it, high, high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused\r\nwith a divine, an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see\r\nher other things too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the\r\nskin, better than those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven,\r\non account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and\r\nthen it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was\r\ntrembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full\r\nview high up above her knee where no-one ever not even on the swing or\r\nwading and she wasn’t ashamed and he wasn’t either to look in that\r\nimmodest way like that because he couldn’t resist the sight of the\r\nwondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so\r\nimmodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking, looking. She\r\nwould fain have cried to him chokingly, held out her snowy slender arms\r\nto him to come, to feel his lips laid on her white brow, the cry of a\r\nyoung girl’s love, a little strangled cry, wrung from her, that cry\r\nthat has rung through the ages. And then a rocket sprang and bang shot\r\nblind blank and O! then the Roman candle burst and it was like a sigh\r\nof O! and everyone cried O! O! in raptures and it gushed out of it a\r\nstream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah! they were all\r\ngreeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so lovely, O, soft, sweet,\r\nsoft!\r\n\r\nThen all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent. Ah! She\r\nglanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of\r\npiteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl.\r\nHe was leaning back against the rock behind. Leopold Bloom (for it is\r\nhe) stands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes.\r\nWhat a brute he had been! At it again? A fair unsullied soul had called\r\nto him and, wretch that he was, how had he answered? An utter cad he\r\nhad been! He of all men! But there was an infinite store of mercy in\r\nthose eyes, for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and\r\nsinned and wandered. Should a girl tell? No, a thousand times no. That\r\nwas their secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there\r\nwas none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly\r\nthrough the evening to and fro and little bats don’t tell.\r\n\r\nCissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to\r\nshow what a great person she was: and then she cried:\r\n\r\n—Gerty! Gerty! We’re going. Come on. We can see from farther up.\r\n\r\nGerty had an idea, one of love’s little ruses. She slipped a hand into\r\nher kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of\r\ncourse without letting him and then slipped it back. Wonder if he’s too\r\nfar to. She rose. Was it goodbye? No. She had to go but they would meet\r\nagain, there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her\r\ndream of yester eve. She drew herself up to her full height. Their\r\nsouls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her\r\nheart, full of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet\r\nflowerlike face. She half smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile,\r\na smile that verged on tears, and then they parted.\r\n\r\nSlowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy,\r\nto Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman. It was\r\ndarker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and\r\nslippy seaweed. She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic\r\nof her but with care and very slowly because—because Gerty MacDowell\r\nwas...\r\n\r\nTight boots? No. She’s lame! O!\r\n\r\nMr Bloom watched her as she limped away. Poor girl! That’s why she’s\r\nleft on the shelf and the others did a sprint. Thought something was\r\nwrong by the cut of her jib. Jilted beauty. A defect is ten times worse\r\nin a woman. But makes them polite. Glad I didn’t know it when she was\r\non show. Hot little devil all the same. I wouldn’t mind. Curiosity like\r\na nun or a negress or a girl with glasses. That squinty one is\r\ndelicate. Near her monthlies, I expect, makes them feel ticklish. I\r\nhave such a bad headache today. Where did I put the letter? Yes, all\r\nright. All kinds of crazy longings. Licking pennies. Girl in Tranquilla\r\nconvent that nun told me liked to smell rock oil. Virgins go mad in the\r\nend I suppose. Sister? How many women in Dublin have it today? Martha,\r\nshe. Something in the air. That’s the moon. But then why don’t all\r\nwomen menstruate at the same time with the same moon, I mean? Depends\r\non the time they were born I suppose. Or all start scratch then get out\r\nof step. Sometimes Molly and Milly together. Anyhow I got the best of\r\nthat. Damned glad I didn’t do it in the bath this morning over her\r\nsilly I will punish you letter. Made up for that tramdriver this\r\nmorning. That gouger M’Coy stopping me to say nothing. And his wife\r\nengagement in the country valise, voice like a pickaxe. Thankful for\r\nsmall mercies. Cheap too. Yours for the asking. Because they want it\r\nthemselves. Their natural craving. Shoals of them every evening poured\r\nout of offices. Reserve better. Don’t want it they throw it at you.\r\nCatch em alive, O. Pity they can’t see themselves. A dream of\r\nwellfilled hose. Where was that? Ah, yes. Mutoscope pictures in Capel\r\nstreet: for men only. Peeping Tom. Willy’s hat and what the girls did\r\nwith it. Do they snapshot those girls or is it all a fake? _Lingerie_\r\ndoes it. Felt for the curves inside her _déshabillé._ Excites them also\r\nwhen they’re. I’m all clean come and dirty me. And they like dressing\r\none another for the sacrifice. Milly delighted with Molly’s new blouse.\r\nAt first. Put them all on to take them all off. Molly. Why I bought her\r\nthe violet garters. Us too: the tie he wore, his lovely socks and\r\nturnedup trousers. He wore a pair of gaiters the night that first we\r\nmet. His lovely shirt was shining beneath his what? of jet. Say a woman\r\nloses a charm with every pin she takes out. Pinned together. O, Mairy\r\nlost the pin of her. Dressed up to the nines for somebody. Fashion part\r\nof their charm. Just changes when you’re on the track of the secret.\r\nExcept the east: Mary, Martha: now as then. No reasonable offer\r\nrefused. She wasn’t in a hurry either. Always off to a fellow when they\r\nare. They never forget an appointment. Out on spec probably. They\r\nbelieve in chance because like themselves. And the others inclined to\r\ngive her an odd dig. Girl friends at school, arms round each other’s\r\nnecks or with ten fingers locked, kissing and whispering secrets about\r\nnothing in the convent garden. Nuns with whitewashed faces, cool coifs\r\nand their rosaries going up and down, vindictive too for what they\r\ncan’t get. Barbed wire. Be sure now and write to me. And I’ll write to\r\nyou. Now won’t you? Molly and Josie Powell. Till Mr Right comes along,\r\nthen meet once in a blue moon. _Tableau!_ O, look who it is for the\r\nlove of God! How are you at all? What have you been doing with\r\nyourself? Kiss and delighted to, kiss, to see you. Picking holes in\r\neach other’s appearance. You’re looking splendid. Sister souls. Showing\r\ntheir teeth at one another. How many have you left? Wouldn’t lend each\r\nother a pinch of salt.\r\n\r\nAh!\r\n\r\nDevils they are when that’s coming on them. Dark devilish appearance.\r\nMolly often told me feel things a ton weight. Scratch the sole of my\r\nfoot. O that way! O, that’s exquisite! Feel it myself too. Good to rest\r\nonce in a way. Wonder if it’s bad to go with them then. Safe in one\r\nway. Turns milk, makes fiddlestrings snap. Something about withering\r\nplants I read in a garden. Besides they say if the flower withers she\r\nwears she’s a flirt. All are. Daresay she felt I. When you feel like\r\nthat you often meet what you feel. Liked me or what? Dress they look\r\nat. Always know a fellow courting: collars and cuffs. Well cocks and\r\nlions do the same and stags. Same time might prefer a tie undone or\r\nsomething. Trousers? Suppose I when I was? No. Gently does it. Dislike\r\nrough and tumble. Kiss in the dark and never tell. Saw something in me.\r\nWonder what. Sooner have me as I am than some poet chap with\r\nbearsgrease plastery hair, lovelock over his dexter optic. To aid\r\ngentleman in literary. Ought to attend to my appearance my age. Didn’t\r\nlet her see me in profile. Still, you never know. Pretty girls and ugly\r\nmen marrying. Beauty and the beast. Besides I can’t be so if Molly.\r\nTook off her hat to show her hair. Wide brim. Bought to hide her face,\r\nmeeting someone might know her, bend down or carry a bunch of flowers\r\nto smell. Hair strong in rut. Ten bob I got for Molly’s combings when\r\nwe were on the rocks in Holles street. Why not? Suppose he gave her\r\nmoney. Why not? All a prejudice. She’s worth ten, fifteen, more, a\r\npound. What? I think so. All that for nothing. Bold hand: Mrs Marion.\r\nDid I forget to write address on that letter like the postcard I sent\r\nto Flynn? And the day I went to Drimmie’s without a necktie. Wrangle\r\nwith Molly it was put me off. No, I remember. Richie Goulding: he’s\r\nanother. Weighs on his mind. Funny my watch stopped at half past four.\r\nDust. Shark liver oil they use to clean. Could do it myself. Save. Was\r\nthat just when he, she?\r\n\r\nO, he did. Into her. She did. Done.\r\n\r\nAh!\r\n\r\nMr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt. O Lord, that\r\nlittle limping devil. Begins to feel cold and clammy. Aftereffect not\r\npleasant. Still you have to get rid of it someway. They don’t care.\r\nComplimented perhaps. Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night\r\nprayers with the kiddies. Well, aren’t they? See her as she is spoil\r\nall. Must have the stage setting, the rouge, costume, position, music.\r\nThe name too. _Amours_ of actresses. Nell Gwynn, Mrs Bracegirdle, Maud\r\nBranscombe. Curtain up. Moonlight silver effulgence. Maiden discovered\r\nwith pensive bosom. Little sweetheart come and kiss me. Still, I feel.\r\nThe strength it gives a man. That’s the secret of it. Good job I let\r\noff there behind the wall coming out of Dignam’s. Cider that was.\r\nOtherwise I couldn’t have. Makes you want to sing after. _Lacaus esant\r\ntaratara_. Suppose I spoke to her. What about? Bad plan however if you\r\ndon’t know how to end the conversation. Ask them a question they ask\r\nyou another. Good idea if you’re stuck. Gain time. But then you’re in a\r\ncart. Wonderful of course if you say: good evening, and you see she’s\r\non for it: good evening. O but the dark evening in the Appian way I\r\nnearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O thinking she was. Whew! Girl in Meath\r\nstreet that night. All the dirty things I made her say. All wrong of\r\ncourse. My arks she called it. It’s so hard to find one who. Aho! If\r\nyou don’t answer when they solicit must be horrible for them till they\r\nharden. And kissed my hand when I gave her the extra two shillings.\r\nParrots. Press the button and the bird will squeak. Wish she hadn’t\r\ncalled me sir. O, her mouth in the dark! And you a married man with a\r\nsingle girl! That’s what they enjoy. Taking a man from another woman.\r\nOr even hear of it. Different with me. Glad to get away from other\r\nchap’s wife. Eating off his cold plate. Chap in the Burton today\r\nspitting back gumchewed gristle. French letter still in my pocketbook.\r\nCause of half the trouble. But might happen sometime, I don’t think.\r\nCome in, all is prepared. I dreamt. What? Worst is beginning. How they\r\nchange the venue when it’s not what they like. Ask you do you like\r\nmushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who. Or ask you what\r\nsomeone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped. Yet if I\r\nwent the whole hog, say: I want to, something like that. Because I did.\r\nShe too. Offend her. Then make it up. Pretend to want something\r\nawfully, then cry off for her sake. Flatters them. She must have been\r\nthinking of someone else all the time. What harm? Must since she came\r\nto the use of reason, he, he and he. First kiss does the trick. The\r\npropitious moment. Something inside them goes pop. Mushy like, tell by\r\ntheir eye, on the sly. First thoughts are best. Remember that till\r\ntheir dying day. Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the\r\nMoorish wall beside the gardens. Fifteen she told me. But her breasts\r\nwere developed. Fell asleep then. After Glencree dinner that was when\r\nwe drove home. Featherbed mountain. Gnashing her teeth in sleep. Lord\r\nmayor had his eye on her too. Val Dillon. Apoplectic.\r\n\r\nThere she is with them down there for the fireworks. My fireworks. Up\r\nlike a rocket, down like a stick. And the children, twins they must be,\r\nwaiting for something to happen. Want to be grownups. Dressing in\r\nmother’s clothes. Time enough, understand all the ways of the world.\r\nAnd the dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth. I knew she\r\ncould whistle. Mouth made for that. Like Molly. Why that highclass\r\nwhore in Jammet’s wore her veil only to her nose. Would you mind,\r\nplease, telling me the right time? I’ll tell you the right time up a\r\ndark lane. Say prunes and prisms forty times every morning, cure for\r\nfat lips. Caressing the little boy too. Onlookers see most of the game.\r\nOf course they understand birds, animals, babies. In their line.\r\n\r\nDidn’t look back when she was going down the strand. Wouldn’t give that\r\nsatisfaction. Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls.\r\nFine eyes she had, clear. It’s the white of the eye brings that out not\r\nso much the pupil. Did she know what I? Course. Like a cat sitting\r\nbeyond a dog’s jump. Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high\r\nschool drawing a picture of Venus with all his belongings on show. Call\r\nthat innocence? Poor idiot! His wife has her work cut out for her.\r\nNever see them sit on a bench marked _Wet Paint_. Eyes all over them.\r\nLook under the bed for what’s not there. Longing to get the fright of\r\ntheir lives. Sharp as needles they are. When I said to Molly the man at\r\nthe corner of Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like,\r\ntwigged at once he had a false arm. Had, too. Where do they get that?\r\nTypist going up Roger Greene’s stairs two at a time to show her\r\nunderstandings. Handed down from father to, mother to daughter, I mean.\r\nBred in the bone. Milly for example drying her handkerchief on the\r\nmirror to save the ironing. Best place for an ad to catch a woman’s eye\r\non a mirror. And when I sent her for Molly’s Paisley shawl to\r\nPrescott’s by the way that ad I must, carrying home the change in her\r\nstocking! Clever little minx. I never told her. Neat way she carries\r\nparcels too. Attract men, small thing like that. Holding up her hand,\r\nshaking it, to let the blood flow back when it was red. Who did you\r\nlearn that from? Nobody. Something the nurse taught me. O, don’t they\r\nknow! Three years old she was in front of Molly’s dressingtable, just\r\nbefore we left Lombard street west. Me have a nice pace. Mullingar. Who\r\nknows? Ways of the world. Young student. Straight on her pins anyway\r\nnot like the other. Still she was game. Lord, I am wet. Devil you are.\r\nSwell of her calf. Transparent stockings, stretched to breaking point.\r\nNot like that frump today. A. E. Rumpled stockings. Or the one in\r\nGrafton street. White. Wow! Beef to the heel.\r\n\r\nA monkey puzzle rocket burst, spluttering in darting crackles. Zrads\r\nand zrads, zrads, zrads. And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to see\r\nand Edy after with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the\r\nrocks. Will she? Watch! Watch! See! Looked round. She smelt an onion.\r\nDarling, I saw, your. I saw all.\r\n\r\nLord!\r\n\r\nDid me good all the same. Off colour after Kiernan’s, Dignam’s. For\r\nthis relief much thanks. In _Hamlet,_ that is. Lord! It was all things\r\ncombined. Excitement. When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt of\r\nmy tongue. Your head it simply swirls. He’s right. Might have made a\r\nworse fool of myself however. Instead of talking about nothing. Then I\r\nwill tell you all. Still it was a kind of language between us. It\r\ncouldn’t be? No, Gerty they called her. Might be false name however\r\nlike my name and the address Dolphin’s barn a blind.\r\n\r\n Her maiden name was Jemina Brown\r\n And she lived with her mother in Irishtown.\r\n\r\nPlace made me think of that I suppose. All tarred with the same brush.\r\nWiping pens in their stockings. But the ball rolled down to her as if\r\nit understood. Every bullet has its billet. Course I never could throw\r\nanything straight at school. Crooked as a ram’s horn. Sad however\r\nbecause it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping\r\nand papa’s pants will soon fit Willy and fuller’s earth for the baby\r\nwhen they hold him out to do ah ah. No soft job. Saves them. Keeps them\r\nout of harm’s way. Nature. Washing child, washing corpse. Dignam.\r\nChildren’s hands always round them. Cocoanut skulls, monkeys, not even\r\nclosed at first, sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds.\r\nOughtn’t to have given that child an empty teat to suck. Fill it up\r\nwith wind. Mrs Beaufoy, Purefoy. Must call to the hospital. Wonder is\r\nnurse Callan there still. She used to look over some nights when Molly\r\nwas in the Coffee Palace. That young doctor O’Hare I noticed her\r\nbrushing his coat. And Mrs Breen and Mrs Dignam once like that too,\r\nmarriageable. Worst of all at night Mrs Duggan told me in the City\r\nArms. Husband rolling in drunk, stink of pub off him like a polecat.\r\nHave that in your nose in the dark, whiff of stale boose. Then ask in\r\nthe morning: was I drunk last night? Bad policy however to fault the\r\nhusband. Chickens come home to roost. They stick by one another like\r\nglue. Maybe the women’s fault also. That’s where Molly can knock spots\r\noff them. It’s the blood of the south. Moorish. Also the form, the\r\nfigure. Hands felt for the opulent. Just compare for instance those\r\nothers. Wife locked up at home, skeleton in the cupboard. Allow me to\r\nintroduce my. Then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript,\r\nwouldn’t know what to call her. Always see a fellow’s weak point in his\r\nwife. Still there’s destiny in it, falling in love. Have their own\r\nsecrets between them. Chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman\r\ndidn’t take them in hand. Then little chits of girls, height of a\r\nshilling in coppers, with little hubbies. As God made them he matched\r\nthem. Sometimes children turn out well enough. Twice nought makes one.\r\nOr old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride. Marry in May and repent\r\nin December. This wet is very unpleasant. Stuck. Well the foreskin is\r\nnot back. Better detach.\r\n\r\nOw!\r\n\r\nOther hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket. Long and the\r\nshort of it. Big he and little she. Very strange about my watch.\r\nWristwatches are always going wrong. Wonder is there any magnetic\r\ninfluence between the person because that was about the time he. Yes, I\r\nsuppose, at once. Cat’s away, the mice will play. I remember looking in\r\nPill lane. Also that now is magnetism. Back of everything magnetism.\r\nEarth for instance pulling this and being pulled. That causes movement.\r\nAnd time, well that’s the time the movement takes. Then if one thing\r\nstopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit. Because it’s all\r\narranged. Magnetic needle tells you what’s going on in the sun, the\r\nstars. Little piece of steel iron. When you hold out the fork. Come.\r\nCome. Tip. Woman and man that is. Fork and steel. Molly, he. Dress up\r\nand look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if\r\nyou’re a man to see that and, like a sneeze coming, legs, look, look\r\nand if you have any guts in you. Tip. Have to let fly.\r\n\r\nWonder how is she feeling in that region. Shame all put on before third\r\nperson. More put out about a hole in her stocking. Molly, her underjaw\r\nstuck out, head back, about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at\r\nthe horse show. And when the painters were in Lombard street west. Fine\r\nvoice that fellow had. How Giuglini began. Smell that I did. Like\r\nflowers. It was too. Violets. Came from the turpentine probably in the\r\npaint. Make their own use of everything. Same time doing it scraped her\r\nslipper on the floor so they wouldn’t hear. But lots of them can’t kick\r\nthe beam, I think. Keep that thing up for hours. Kind of a general all\r\nround over me and half down my back.\r\n\r\nWait. Hm. Hm. Yes. That’s her perfume. Why she waved her hand. I leave\r\nyou this to think of me when I’m far away on the pillow. What is it?\r\nHeliotrope? No. Hyacinth? Hm. Roses, I think. She’d like scent of that\r\nkind. Sweet and cheap: soon sour. Why Molly likes opoponax. Suits her,\r\nwith a little jessamine mixed. Her high notes and her low notes. At the\r\ndance night she met him, dance of the hours. Heat brought it out. She\r\nwas wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before. Good\r\nconductor, is it? Or bad? Light too. Suppose there’s some connection.\r\nFor instance if you go into a cellar where it’s dark. Mysterious thing\r\ntoo. Why did I smell it only now? Took its time in coming like herself,\r\nslow but sure. Suppose it’s ever so many millions of tiny grains blown\r\nacross. Yes, it is. Because those spice islands, Cinghalese this\r\nmorning, smell them leagues off. Tell you what it is. It’s like a fine\r\nfine veil or web they have all over the skin, fine like what do you\r\ncall it gossamer, and they’re always spinning it out of them, fine as\r\nanything, like rainbow colours without knowing it. Clings to everything\r\nshe takes off. Vamp of her stockings. Warm shoe. Stays. Drawers: little\r\nkick, taking them off. Byby till next time. Also the cat likes to sniff\r\nin her shift on the bed. Know her smell in a thousand. Bathwater too.\r\nReminds me of strawberries and cream. Wonder where it is really. There\r\nor the armpits or under the neck. Because you get it out of all holes\r\nand corners. Hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something.\r\nMuskrat. Bag under their tails. One grain pour off odour for years.\r\nDogs at each other behind. Good evening. Evening. How do you sniff? Hm.\r\nHm. Very well, thank you. Animals go by that. Yes now, look at it that\r\nway. We’re the same. Some women, instance, warn you off when they have\r\ntheir period. Come near. Then get a hogo you could hang your hat on.\r\nLike what? Potted herrings gone stale or. Boof! Please keep off the\r\ngrass.\r\n\r\nPerhaps they get a man smell off us. What though? Cigary gloves long\r\nJohn had on his desk the other day. Breath? What you eat and drink\r\ngives that. No. Mansmell, I mean. Must be connected with that because\r\npriests that are supposed to be are different. Women buzz round it like\r\nflies round treacle. Railed off the altar get on to it at any cost. The\r\ntree of forbidden priest. O, father, will you? Let me be the first to.\r\nThat diffuses itself all through the body, permeates. Source of life.\r\nAnd it’s extremely curious the smell. Celery sauce. Let me.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom inserted his nose. Hm. Into the. Hm. Opening of his waistcoat.\r\nAlmonds or. No. Lemons it is. Ah no, that’s the soap.\r\n\r\nO by the by that lotion. I knew there was something on my mind. Never\r\nwent back and the soap not paid. Dislike carrying bottles like that hag\r\nthis morning. Hynes might have paid me that three shillings. I could\r\nmention Meagher’s just to remind him. Still if he works that paragraph.\r\nTwo and nine. Bad opinion of me he’ll have. Call tomorrow. How much do\r\nI owe you? Three and nine? Two and nine, sir. Ah. Might stop him giving\r\ncredit another time. Lose your customers that way. Pubs do. Fellows run\r\nup a bill on the slate and then slinking around the back streets into\r\nsomewhere else.\r\n\r\nHere’s this nobleman passed before. Blown in from the bay. Just went as\r\nfar as turn back. Always at home at dinnertime. Looks mangled out: had\r\na good tuck in. Enjoying nature now. Grace after meals. After supper\r\nwalk a mile. Sure he has a small bank balance somewhere, government\r\nsit. Walk after him now make him awkward like those newsboys me today.\r\nStill you learn something. See ourselves as others see us. So long as\r\nwomen don’t mock what matter? That’s the way to find out. Ask yourself\r\nwho is he now. _The Mystery Man on the Beach_, prize titbit story by Mr\r\nLeopold Bloom. Payment at the rate of one guinea per column. And that\r\nfellow today at the graveside in the brown macintosh. Corns on his\r\nkismet however. Healthy perhaps absorb all the. Whistle brings rain\r\nthey say. Must be some somewhere. Salt in the Ormond damp. The body\r\nfeels the atmosphere. Old Betty’s joints are on the rack. Mother\r\nShipton’s prophecy that is about ships around they fly in the\r\ntwinkling. No. Signs of rain it is. The royal reader. And distant hills\r\nseem coming nigh.\r\n\r\nHowth. Bailey light. Two, four, six, eight, nine. See. Has to change or\r\nthey might think it a house. Wreckers. Grace Darling. People afraid of\r\nthe dark. Also glowworms, cyclists: lightingup time. Jewels diamonds\r\nflash better. Women. Light is a kind of reassuring. Not going to hurt\r\nyou. Better now of course than long ago. Country roads. Run you through\r\nthe small guts for nothing. Still two types there are you bob against.\r\nScowl or smile. Pardon! Not at all. Best time to spray plants too in\r\nthe shade after the sun. Some light still. Red rays are longest.\r\nRoygbiv Vance taught us: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo,\r\nviolet. A star I see. Venus? Can’t tell yet. Two. When three it’s\r\nnight. Were those nightclouds there all the time? Looks like a phantom\r\nship. No. Wait. Trees are they? An optical illusion. Mirage. Land of\r\nthe setting sun this. Homerule sun setting in the southeast. My native\r\nland, goodnight.\r\n\r\nDew falling. Bad for you, dear, to sit on that stone. Brings on white\r\nfluxions. Never have little baby then less he was big strong fight his\r\nway up through. Might get piles myself. Sticks too like a summer cold,\r\nsore on the mouth. Cut with grass or paper worst. Friction of the\r\nposition. Like to be that rock she sat on. O sweet little, you don’t\r\nknow how nice you looked. I begin to like them at that age. Green\r\napples. Grab at all that offer. Suppose it’s the only time we cross\r\nlegs, seated. Also the library today: those girl graduates. Happy\r\nchairs under them. But it’s the evening influence. They feel all that.\r\nOpen like flowers, know their hours, sunflowers, Jerusalem artichokes,\r\nin ballrooms, chandeliers, avenues under the lamps. Nightstock in Mat\r\nDillon’s garden where I kissed her shoulder. Wish I had a full length\r\noilpainting of her then. June that was too I wooed. The year returns.\r\nHistory repeats itself. Ye crags and peaks I’m with you once again.\r\nLife, love, voyage round your own little world. And now? Sad about her\r\nlame of course but must be on your guard not to feel too much pity.\r\nThey take advantage.\r\n\r\nAll quiet on Howth now. The distant hills seem. Where we. The\r\nrhododendrons. I am a fool perhaps. He gets the plums, and I the\r\nplumstones. Where I come in. All that old hill has seen. Names change:\r\nthat’s all. Lovers: yum yum.\r\n\r\nTired I feel now. Will I get up? O wait. Drained all the manhood out of\r\nme, little wretch. She kissed me. Never again. My youth. Only once it\r\ncomes. Or hers. Take the train there tomorrow. No. Returning not the\r\nsame. Like kids your second visit to a house. The new I want. Nothing\r\nnew under the sun. Care of P. O. Dolphin’s Barn. Are you not happy in\r\nyour? Naughty darling. At Dolphin’s barn charades in Luke Doyle’s\r\nhouse. Mat Dillon and his bevy of daughters: Tiny, Atty, Floey, Maimy,\r\nLouy, Hetty. Molly too. Eightyseven that was. Year before we. And the\r\nold major, partial to his drop of spirits. Curious she an only child, I\r\nan only child. So it returns. Think you’re escaping and run into\r\nyourself. Longest way round is the shortest way home. And just when he\r\nand she. Circus horse walking in a ring. Rip van Winkle we played. Rip:\r\ntear in Henny Doyle’s overcoat. Van: breadvan delivering. Winkle:\r\ncockles and periwinkles. Then I did Rip van Winkle coming back. She\r\nleaned on the sideboard watching. Moorish eyes. Twenty years asleep in\r\nSleepy Hollow. All changed. Forgotten. The young are old. His gun rusty\r\nfrom the dew.\r\n\r\nBa. What is that flying about? Swallow? Bat probably. Thinks I’m a\r\ntree, so blind. Have birds no smell? Metempsychosis. They believed you\r\ncould be changed into a tree from grief. Weeping willow. Ba. There he\r\ngoes. Funny little beggar. Wonder where he lives. Belfry up there. Very\r\nlikely. Hanging by his heels in the odour of sanctity. Bell scared him\r\nout, I suppose. Mass seems to be over. Could hear them all at it. Pray\r\nfor us. And pray for us. And pray for us. Good idea the repetition.\r\nSame thing with ads. Buy from us. And buy from us. Yes, there’s the\r\nlight in the priest’s house. Their frugal meal. Remember about the\r\nmistake in the valuation when I was in Thom’s. Twentyeight it is. Two\r\nhouses they have. Gabriel Conroy’s brother is curate. Ba. Again. Wonder\r\nwhy they come out at night like mice. They’re a mixed breed. Birds are\r\nlike hopping mice. What frightens them, light or noise? Better sit\r\nstill. All instinct like the bird in drouth got water out of the end of\r\na jar by throwing in pebbles. Like a little man in a cloak he is with\r\ntiny hands. Weeny bones. Almost see them shimmering, kind of a bluey\r\nwhite. Colours depend on the light you see. Stare the sun for example\r\nlike the eagle then look at a shoe see a blotch blob yellowish. Wants\r\nto stamp his trademark on everything. Instance, that cat this morning\r\non the staircase. Colour of brown turf. Say you never see them with\r\nthree colours. Not true. That half tabbywhite tortoiseshell in the\r\n_City Arms_ with the letter em on her forehead. Body fifty different\r\ncolours. Howth a while ago amethyst. Glass flashing. That’s how that\r\nwise man what’s his name with the burning glass. Then the heather goes\r\non fire. It can’t be tourists’ matches. What? Perhaps the sticks dry\r\nrub together in the wind and light. Or broken bottles in the furze act\r\nas a burning glass in the sun. Archimedes. I have it! My memory’s not\r\nso bad.\r\n\r\nBa. Who knows what they’re always flying for. Insects? That bee last\r\nweek got into the room playing with his shadow on the ceiling. Might be\r\nthe one bit me, come back to see. Birds too. Never find out. Or what\r\nthey say. Like our small talk. And says she and says he. Nerve they\r\nhave to fly over the ocean and back. Lots must be killed in storms,\r\ntelegraph wires. Dreadful life sailors have too. Big brutes of\r\noceangoing steamers floundering along in the dark, lowing out like\r\nseacows. _Faugh a ballagh!_ Out of that, bloody curse to you! Others in\r\nvessels, bit of a handkerchief sail, pitched about like snuff at a wake\r\nwhen the stormy winds do blow. Married too. Sometimes away for years at\r\nthe ends of the earth somewhere. No ends really because it’s round.\r\nWife in every port they say. She has a good job if she minds it till\r\nJohnny comes marching home again. If ever he does. Smelling the tail\r\nend of ports. How can they like the sea? Yet they do. The anchor’s\r\nweighed. Off he sails with a scapular or a medal on him for luck. Well.\r\nAnd the tephilim no what’s this they call it poor papa’s father had on\r\nhis door to touch. That brought us out of the land of Egypt and into\r\nthe house of bondage. Something in all those superstitions because when\r\nyou go out never know what dangers. Hanging on to a plank or astride of\r\na beam for grim life, lifebelt round him, gulping salt water, and\r\nthat’s the last of his nibs till the sharks catch hold of him. Do fish\r\never get seasick?\r\n\r\nThen you have a beautiful calm without a cloud, smooth sea, placid,\r\ncrew and cargo in smithereens, Davy Jones’ locker, moon looking down so\r\npeaceful. Not my fault, old cockalorum.\r\n\r\nA last lonely candle wandered up the sky from Mirus bazaar in search of\r\nfunds for Mercer’s hospital and broke, drooping, and shed a cluster of\r\nviolet but one white stars. They floated, fell: they faded. The\r\nshepherd’s hour: the hour of folding: hour of tryst. From house to\r\nhouse, giving his everwelcome double knock, went the nine o’clock\r\npostman, the glowworm’s lamp at his belt gleaming here and there\r\nthrough the laurel hedges. And among the five young trees a hoisted\r\nlintstock lit the lamp at Leahy’s terrace. By screens of lighted\r\nwindows, by equal gardens a shrill voice went crying, wailing: _Evening\r\nTelegraph, stop press edition! Result of the Gold Cup races!_ and from\r\nthe door of Dignam’s house a boy ran out and called. Twittering the bat\r\nflew here, flew there. Far out over the sands the coming surf crept,\r\ngrey. Howth settled for slumber, tired of long days, of yumyum\r\nrhododendrons (he was old) and felt gladly the night breeze lift,\r\nruffle his fell of ferns. He lay but opened a red eye unsleeping, deep\r\nand slowly breathing, slumberous but awake. And far on Kish bank the\r\nanchored lightship twinkled, winked at Mr Bloom.\r\n\r\nLife those chaps out there must have, stuck in the same spot. Irish\r\nLights board. Penance for their sins. Coastguards too. Rocket and\r\nbreeches buoy and lifeboat. Day we went out for the pleasure cruise in\r\nthe Erin’s King, throwing them the sack of old papers. Bears in the\r\nzoo. Filthy trip. Drunkards out to shake up their livers. Puking\r\noverboard to feed the herrings. Nausea. And the women, fear of God in\r\ntheir faces. Milly, no sign of funk. Her blue scarf loose, laughing.\r\nDon’t know what death is at that age. And then their stomachs clean.\r\nBut being lost they fear. When we hid behind the tree at Crumlin. I\r\ndidn’t want to. Mamma! Mamma! Babes in the wood. Frightening them with\r\nmasks too. Throwing them up in the air to catch them. I’ll murder you.\r\nIs it only half fun? Or children playing battle. Whole earnest. How can\r\npeople aim guns at each other. Sometimes they go off. Poor kids! Only\r\ntroubles wildfire and nettlerash. Calomel purge I got her for that.\r\nAfter getting better asleep with Molly. Very same teeth she has. What\r\ndo they love? Another themselves? But the morning she chased her with\r\nthe umbrella. Perhaps so as not to hurt. I felt her pulse. Ticking.\r\nLittle hand it was: now big. Dearest Papli. All that the hand says when\r\nyou touch. Loved to count my waistcoat buttons. Her first stays I\r\nremember. Made me laugh to see. Little paps to begin with. Left one is\r\nmore sensitive, I think. Mine too. Nearer the heart? Padding themselves\r\nout if fat is in fashion. Her growing pains at night, calling, wakening\r\nme. Frightened she was when her nature came on her first. Poor child!\r\nStrange moment for the mother too. Brings back her girlhood. Gibraltar.\r\nLooking from Buena Vista. O’Hara’s tower. The seabirds screaming. Old\r\nBarbary ape that gobbled all his family. Sundown, gunfire for the men\r\nto cross the lines. Looking out over the sea she told me. Evening like\r\nthis, but clear, no clouds. I always thought I’d marry a lord or a rich\r\ngentleman coming with a private yacht. _Buenas noches, señorita. El\r\nhombre ama la muchacha hermosa_. Why me? Because you were so foreign\r\nfrom the others.\r\n\r\nBetter not stick here all night like a limpet. This weather makes you\r\ndull. Must be getting on for nine by the light. Go home. Too late for\r\n_Leah, Lily of Killarney._ No. Might be still up. Call to the hospital\r\nto see. Hope she’s over. Long day I’ve had. Martha, the bath, funeral,\r\nhouse of Keyes, museum with those goddesses, Dedalus’ song. Then that\r\nbawler in Barney Kiernan’s. Got my own back there. Drunken ranters what\r\nI said about his God made him wince. Mistake to hit back. Or? No. Ought\r\nto go home and laugh at themselves. Always want to be swilling in\r\ncompany. Afraid to be alone like a child of two. Suppose he hit me.\r\nLook at it other way round. Not so bad then. Perhaps not to hurt he\r\nmeant. Three cheers for Israel. Three cheers for the sister-in-law he\r\nhawked about, three fangs in her mouth. Same style of beauty.\r\nParticularly nice old party for a cup of tea. The sister of the wife of\r\nthe wild man of Borneo has just come to town. Imagine that in the early\r\nmorning at close range. Everyone to his taste as Morris said when he\r\nkissed the cow. But Dignam’s put the boots on it. Houses of mourning so\r\ndepressing because you never know. Anyhow she wants the money. Must\r\ncall to those Scottish Widows as I promised. Strange name. Takes it for\r\ngranted we’re going to pop off first. That widow on Monday was it\r\noutside Cramer’s that looked at me. Buried the poor husband but\r\nprogressing favourably on the premium. Her widow’s mite. Well? What do\r\nyou expect her to do? Must wheedle her way along. Widower I hate to\r\nsee. Looks so forlorn. Poor man O’Connor wife and five children\r\npoisoned by mussels here. The sewage. Hopeless. Some good matronly\r\nwoman in a porkpie hat to mother him. Take him in tow, platter face and\r\na large apron. Ladies’ grey flannelette bloomers, three shillings a\r\npair, astonishing bargain. Plain and loved, loved for ever, they say.\r\nUgly: no woman thinks she is. Love, lie and be handsome for tomorrow we\r\ndie. See him sometimes walking about trying to find out who played the\r\ntrick. U. p: up. Fate that is. He, not me. Also a shop often noticed.\r\nCurse seems to dog it. Dreamt last night? Wait. Something confused. She\r\nhad red slippers on. Turkish. Wore the breeches. Suppose she does?\r\nWould I like her in pyjamas? Damned hard to answer. Nannetti’s gone.\r\nMailboat. Near Holyhead by now. Must nail that ad of Keyes’s. Work\r\nHynes and Crawford. Petticoats for Molly. She has something to put in\r\nthem. What’s that? Might be money.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom stooped and turned over a piece of paper on the strand. He\r\nbrought it near his eyes and peered. Letter? No. Can’t read. Better go.\r\nBetter. I’m tired to move. Page of an old copybook. All those holes and\r\npebbles. Who could count them? Never know what you find. Bottle with\r\nstory of a treasure in it, thrown from a wreck. Parcels post. Children\r\nalways want to throw things in the sea. Trust? Bread cast on the\r\nwaters. What’s this? Bit of stick.\r\n\r\nO! Exhausted that female has me. Not so young now. Will she come here\r\ntomorrow? Wait for her somewhere for ever. Must come back. Murderers\r\ndo. Will I?\r\n\r\nMr Bloom with his stick gently vexed the thick sand at his foot. Write\r\na message for her. Might remain. What?"

Certainly in every public work\r\nwhich in it anything of gravity contains preparation should be with\r\nimportance commensurate and therefore a plan was by them adopted\r\n(whether by having preconsidered or as the maturation of experience it\r\nis difficult in being said which the discrepant opinions of subsequent\r\ninquirers are not up to the present congrued to render manifest)\r\nwhereby maternity was so far from all accident possibility removed that\r\nwhatever care the patient in that allhardest of woman hour chiefly\r\nrequired and not solely for the copiously opulent but also for her who\r\nnot being sufficiently moneyed scarcely and often not even scarcely\r\ncould subsist valiantly and for an inconsiderable emolument was\r\nprovided.\r\n\r\nTo her nothing already then and thenceforward was anyway able to be\r\nmolestful for this chiefly felt all citizens except with proliferent\r\nmothers prosperity at all not to can be and as they had received\r\neternity gods mortals generation to befit them her beholding, when the\r\ncase was so hoving itself, parturient in vehicle thereward carrying\r\ndesire immense among all one another was impelling on of her to be\r\nreceived into that domicile.

Of\r\nIsrael’s folk was that man that on earth wandering far had fared. Stark\r\nruth of man his errand that him lone led till that house.\r\n\r\nOf that house A. Horne is lord. Seventy beds keeps he there teeming\r\nmothers are wont that they lie for to thole and bring forth bairns hale\r\nso God’s angel to Mary quoth. Watchers tway there walk, white sisters\r\nin ward sleepless. Smarts they still, sickness soothing: in twelve\r\nmoons thrice an hundred. Truest bedthanes they twain are, for Horne\r\nholding wariest ward.\r\n\r\nIn ward wary the watcher hearing come that man mildhearted eft rising\r\nwith swire ywimpled to him her gate wide undid. Lo, levin leaping\r\nlightens in eyeblink Ireland’s westward welkin. Full she drad that God\r\nthe Wreaker all mankind would fordo with water for his evil sins.\r\nChrist’s rood made she on breastbone and him drew that he would rathe\r\ninfare under her thatch. That man her will wotting worthful went in\r\nHorne’s house.\r\n\r\nLoth to irk in Horne’s hall hat holding the seeker stood. On her stow\r\nhe ere was living with dear wife and lovesome daughter that then over\r\nland and seafloor nine years had long outwandered. Once her in\r\ntownhithe meeting he to her bow had not doffed. Her to forgive now he\r\ncraved with good ground of her allowed that that of him swiftseen face,\r\nhers, so young then had looked. Light swift her eyes kindled, bloom of\r\nblushes his word winning.\r\n\r\nAs her eyes then ongot his weeds swart therefor sorrow she feared. Glad\r\nafter she was that ere adread was. Her he asked if O’Hare Doctor\r\ntidings sent from far coast and she with grameful sigh him answered\r\nthat O’Hare Doctor in heaven was. Sad was the man that word to hear\r\nthat him so heavied in bowels ruthful. All she there told him, ruing\r\ndeath for friend so young, algate sore unwilling God’s rightwiseness to\r\nwithsay. She said that he had a fair sweet death through God His\r\ngoodness with masspriest to be shriven, holy housel and sick men’s oil\r\nto his limbs. The man then right earnest asked the nun of which death\r\nthe dead man was died and the nun answered him and said that he was\r\ndied in Mona Island through bellycrab three year agone come Childermas\r\nand she prayed to God the Allruthful to have his dear soul in his\r\nundeathliness. He heard her sad words, in held hat sad staring. So\r\nstood they there both awhile in wanhope sorrowing one with other.\r\n\r\nTherefore, everyman, look to that last end that is thy death and the\r\ndust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came\r\nnaked forth from his mother’s womb so naked shall he wend him at the\r\nlast for to go as he came.\r\n\r\nThe man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman\r\nand he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in\r\nchildbed. The nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in\r\nthroes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to\r\nbear but that now in a little it would be. She said thereto that she\r\nhad seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that\r\nwoman’s birth. Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew\r\nthe man that time was had lived nigh that house. The man hearkened to\r\nher words for he felt with wonder women’s woe in the travail that they\r\nhave of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair\r\nface for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a\r\nhandmaid. Nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless.\r\n\r\nAnd whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there\r\nnighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat. And there\r\ncame against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept\r\nDixon. And the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed\r\nthat they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where\r\nthis learningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be\r\nhealed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a\r\nhorrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a\r\nsalve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice. And he\r\nsaid now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with\r\nthem that were there. And the traveller Leopold said that he should go\r\notherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile. Also the lady\r\nwas of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well\r\nthat the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility. But\r\nthe learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have\r\nhim in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a\r\nmarvellous castle. And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for\r\nto rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches\r\nenvironing in divers lands and sometime venery.\r\n\r\nAnd in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy\r\nand it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not\r\nmove more for enchantment. And on this board were frightful swords and\r\nknives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white\r\nflames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there\r\nabound marvellously. And there were vessels that are wrought by magic\r\nof Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that\r\nhe blases in to them like to bubbles. And full fair cheer and rich was\r\non the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer. And there\r\nwas a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay\r\nstrange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be\r\npossible thing without they see it natheless they are so. And these\r\nfishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of\r\nthe fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress. And\r\nalso it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a\r\ncompost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of\r\ncertain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like\r\nto a vast mountain. And they teach the serpents there to entwine\r\nthemselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of\r\nthese serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead.\r\n\r\nAnd the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp\r\nthereto the while all they that were there drank every each. And childe\r\nLeopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat\r\nin amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and\r\nanon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and\r\nhis neighbour nist not of this wile. And he sat down in that castle\r\nwith them for to rest him there awhile. Thanked be Almighty God.\r\n\r\nThis meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at\r\nthe reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing\r\nfor there was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time\r\nhied fast. Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered\r\nwhat cry that it was whether of child or woman and I marvel, said he,\r\nthat it be not come or now. Meseems it dureth overlong. And he was ware\r\nand saw a franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was\r\nolder than any of the tother and for that they both were knights\r\nvirtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke\r\nto him full gently. But, said he, or it be long too she will bring\r\nforth by God His bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath\r\nwaited marvellous long. And the franklin that had drunken said,\r\nExpecting each moment to be her next. Also he took the cup that stood\r\ntofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to\r\ndrink and, Now drink, said he, fully delectably, and he quaffed as far\r\nas he might to their both’s health for he was a passing good man of his\r\nlustiness. And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat\r\nin scholars’ hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that\r\never laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight\r\nof the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged\r\nhim courtly in the cup. Woman’s woe with wonder pondering.\r\n\r\nNow let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be\r\ndrunken an they might. There was a sort of scholars along either side\r\nthe board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary\r\nMerciable’s with other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of\r\nmedicine, and the franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa,\r\none Crotthers, and young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at\r\nhead of the board and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long\r\nof a mastery of him erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young\r\nStephen, he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and\r\nbeside the meek sir Leopold. But on young Malachi they waited for that\r\nhe promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how\r\nhe had broke his avow. And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast\r\nfriendship to sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that\r\nhis languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as\r\nthey feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner. Ruth red\r\nhim, love led on with will to wander, loth to leave.\r\n\r\nFor they were right witty scholars. And he heard their aresouns each\r\ngen other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining\r\nthat put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen\r\nout a matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne’s house\r\nthat now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next\r\nbefore her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her\r\ncase). And they said farther she should live because in the beginning,\r\nthey said, the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that\r\nwere of this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for\r\nhe had conscience to let her die. And not few and of these was young\r\nLynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it\r\nwas never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the\r\nlaw nor his judges did provide no remedy. A redress God grant. This was\r\nscant said but all cried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother,\r\nthe wife should live and the babe to die. In colour whereof they waxed\r\nhot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but\r\nthe franklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at\r\nthe least way mirth might not lack. Then young Madden showed all the\r\nwhole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion\r\nsake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint\r\nUltan of Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby\r\nthey were all wondrous grieved. To whom young Stephen had these words\r\nfollowing: Murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk. Both babe and\r\nparent now glorify their Maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in\r\npurgefire. But, gramercy, what of those Godpossibled souls that we\r\nnightly impossibilise, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost, Very\r\nGod, Lord and Giver of Life? For, sirs, he said, our lust is brief. We\r\nare means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends\r\nthan we. Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends.\r\nBut he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was\r\nthat he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or\r\nleman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead.\r\nWhereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi’s praise of that\r\nbeast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the\r\nother all this while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they\r\ndid malice him, witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his\r\nengines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to\r\ndo. Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir\r\nLeopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour\r\nwhich he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare\r\nwhoso she might be or wheresoever. Then spake young Stephen orgulous of\r\nmother Church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons,\r\nof Lilith, patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of\r\nbrightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius\r\nsaith, by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or\r\nan she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with, _effectu\r\nsecuto_, or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of\r\nAverroes and Moses Maimonides. He said also how at the end of the\r\nsecond month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother\r\nfoldeth ever souls for God’s greater glory whereas that earthly mother\r\nwhich was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he\r\nthat holdeth the fisherman’s seal, even that blessed Peter on which\r\nrock was holy church for all ages founded. All they bachelors then\r\nasked of sir Leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as\r\nrisk life to save life. A wariness of mind he would answer as fitted\r\nall and, laying hand to jaw, he said dissembling, as his wont was, that\r\nas it was informed him, who had ever loved the art of physic as might a\r\nlayman, and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an\r\naccident it was good for that mother Church belike at one blow had\r\nbirth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their\r\nquestions. That is truth, pardy, said Dixon, and, or I err, a pregnant\r\nword. Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he\r\naverred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for he\r\nwas of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that\r\ntaking it appeared eftsoons.\r\n\r\nBut sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had\r\npity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and\r\nas he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only\r\nmanchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art\r\ncould save so dark is destiny. And she was wondrous stricken of heart\r\nfor that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of\r\nlamb’s wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and\r\nlie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now sir\r\nLeopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him\r\nhis friend’s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness\r\nand as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for\r\nall accounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure\r\nfor young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and\r\nmurdered his goods with whores.\r\n\r\nAbout that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty\r\nso as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed\r\ntheir approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying\r\nfor the intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge\r\nthe vicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray. Now drink\r\nwe, quod he, of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed\r\nparcel of my body but my soul’s bodiment. Leave ye fraction of bread to\r\nthem that live by bread alone. Be not afeard neither for any want for\r\nthis will comfort more than the other will dismay. See ye here. And he\r\nshowed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the\r\nworth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song\r\nwhich he writ. They all admired to see the foresaid riches in such\r\ndearth of money as was herebefore. His words were then these as\r\nfolloweth: Know all men, he said, time’s ruins build eternity’s\r\nmansions. What means this? Desire’s wind blasts the thorntree but after\r\nit becomes from a bramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of time. Mark\r\nme now. In woman’s womb word is made flesh but in the spirit of the\r\nmaker all flesh that passes becomes the word that shall not pass away.\r\nThis is the postcreation. _Omnis caro ad te veniet_. No question but\r\nher name is puissant who aventried the dear corse of our Agenbuyer,\r\nHealer and Herd, our mighty mother and mother most venerable and\r\nBernardus saith aptly that She hath an _omnipotentiam deiparae\r\nsupplicem_, that is to wit, an almightiness of petition because she is\r\nthe second Eve and she won us, saith Augustine too, whereas that other,\r\nour grandam, which we are linked up with by successive anastomosis of\r\nnavelcords sold us all, seed, breed and generation, for a penny pippin.\r\nBut here is the matter now. Or she knew him, that second I say, and was\r\nbut creature of her creature, _vergine madre, figlia di tuo figlio_, or\r\nshe knew him not and then stands she in the one denial or ignorancy\r\nwith Peter Piscator who lives in the house that Jack built and with\r\nJoseph the joiner patron of the happy demise of all unhappy marriages,\r\n_parceque M. Léo Taxil nous a dit que qui l’avait mise dans cette\r\nfichue position c’était le sacré pigeon, ventre de Dieu! Entweder_\r\ntransubstantiality _oder_ consubstantiality but in no case\r\nsubsubstantiality. And all cried out upon it for a very scurvy word. A\r\npregnancy without joy, he said, a birth without pangs, a body without\r\nblemish, a belly without bigness. Let the lewd with faith and fervour\r\nworship. With will will we withstand, withsay.\r\n\r\nHereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would\r\nsing a bawdy catch _Staboo Stabella_ about a wench that was put in pod\r\nof a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack:\r\n_The first three months she was not well, Staboo,_ when here nurse\r\nQuigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was\r\nit not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all\r\norderly against lord Andrew came for because she was jealous that no\r\ngasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard. It was an\r\nancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking, in\r\nhabit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage, nor did her\r\nhortative want of it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of\r\nthem all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness\r\nsome and shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all\r\nchode with him, a murrain seize the dolt, what a devil he would be at,\r\nthou chuff, thou puny, thou got in peasestraw, thou losel, thou\r\nchitterling, thou spawn of a rebel, thou dykedropt, thou abortion thou,\r\nto shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of God ape, the\r\ngood sir Leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet,\r\nmargerain gentle, advising also the time’s occasion as most sacred and\r\nmost worthy to be most sacred. In Horne’s house rest should reign.\r\n\r\nTo be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in\r\nEccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he\r\nhad not cided to take friar’s vows and he answered him obedience in the\r\nwomb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days. Master\r\nLenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds\r\nand how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue\r\nof a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all\r\nintershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership. But he\r\nsaid very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was\r\nthe eternal son and ever virgin. Thereat mirth grew in them the more\r\nand they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing\r\nand deflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island,\r\nshe to be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain,\r\nwith burning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries\r\nand the anthem _Ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium_ till she was\r\nthere unmaided. He gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those\r\ndelicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is\r\nin their _Maid’s Tragedy_ that was writ for a like twining of lovers:\r\n_To bed, to bed_ was the burden of it to be played with accompanable\r\nconcent upon the virginals. An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most\r\nmollificative suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous\r\nflambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium\r\nof connubial communion. Well met they were, said Master Dixon, joyed,\r\nbut, harkee, young sir, better were they named Beau Mount and Lecher\r\nfor, by my troth, of such a mingling much might come. Young Stephen\r\nsaid indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between\r\nthem and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for\r\nlife ran very high in those days and the custom of the country approved\r\nwith it. Greater love than this, he said, no man hath that a man lay\r\ndown his wife for his friend. Go thou and do likewise. Thus, or words\r\nto that effect, saith Zarathustra, sometime regius professor of French\r\nletters to the university of Oxtail nor breathed there ever that man to\r\nwhom mankind was more beholden. Bring a stranger within thy tower it\r\nwill go hard but thou wilt have the secondbest bed. _Orate, fratres,\r\npro memetipso_. And all the people shall say, Amen. Remember, Erin, thy\r\ngenerations and thy days of old, how thou settedst little by me and by\r\nmy word and broughtedst in a stranger to my gates to commit fornication\r\nin my sight and to wax fat and kick like Jeshurum. Therefore hast thou\r\nsinned against my light and hast made me, thy lord, to be the slave of\r\nservants. Return, return, Clan Milly: forget me not, O Milesian. Why\r\nhast thou done this abomination before me that thou didst spurn me for\r\na merchant of jalaps and didst deny me to the Roman and to the Indian\r\nof dark speech with whom thy daughters did lie luxuriously? Look forth\r\nnow, my people, upon the land of behest, even from Horeb and from Nebo\r\nand from Pisgah and from the Horns of Hatten unto a land flowing with\r\nmilk and money. But thou hast suckled me with a bitter milk: my moon\r\nand my sun thou hast quenched for ever. And thou hast left me alone for\r\never in the dark ways of my bitterness: and with a kiss of ashes hast\r\nthou kissed my mouth. This tenebrosity of the interior, he proceeded to\r\nsay, hath not been illumined by the wit of the septuagint nor so much\r\nas mentioned for the Orient from on high which brake hell’s gates\r\nvisited a darkness that was foraneous. Assuefaction minorates\r\natrocities (as Tully saith of his darling Stoics) and Hamlet his father\r\nshoweth the prince no blister of combustion. The adiaphane in the noon\r\nof life is an Egypt’s plague which in the nights of prenativity and\r\npostmortemity is their most proper _ubi_ and _quomodo_. And as the ends\r\nand ultimates of all things accord in some mean and measure with their\r\ninceptions and originals, that same multiplicit concordance which leads\r\nforth growth from birth accomplishing by a retrogressive metamorphosis\r\nthat minishing and ablation towards the final which is agreeable unto\r\nnature so is it with our subsolar being. The aged sisters draw us into\r\nlife: we wail, batten, sport, clip, clasp, sunder, dwindle, die: over\r\nus dead they bend. First, saved from waters of old Nile, among\r\nbulrushes, a bed of fasciated wattles: at last the cavity of a\r\nmountain, an occulted sepulchre amid the conclamation of the hillcat\r\nand the ossifrage. And as no man knows the ubicity of his tumulus nor\r\nto what processes we shall thereby be ushered nor whether to Tophet or\r\nto Edenville in the like way is all hidden when we would backward see\r\nfrom what region of remoteness the whatness of our whoness hath fetched\r\nhis whenceness.\r\n\r\nThereto Punch Costello roared out mainly _Etienne chanson_ but he\r\nloudly bid them, lo, wisdom hath built herself a house, this vast\r\nmajestic longstablished vault, the crystal palace of the Creator, all\r\nin applepie order, a penny for him who finds the pea.\r\n\r\n Behold the mansion reared by dedal Jack\r\n See the malt stored in many a refluent sack,\r\n In the proud cirque of Jackjohn’s bivouac.\r\n\r\nA black crack of noise in the street here, alack, bawled back. Loud on\r\nleft Thor thundered: in anger awful the hammerhurler. Came now the\r\nstorm that hist his heart. And Master Lynch bade him have a care to\r\nflout and witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and\r\npaganry. And he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as\r\nthey might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before\r\nso haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart\r\nshook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that\r\nstorm. Then did some mock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard\r\nagain to his yale which Master Lenehan vowed he would do after and he\r\nwas indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour. But the\r\nbraggart boaster cried that an old Nobodaddy was in his cups it was\r\nmuchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead. But this was\r\nonly to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in Horne’s hall. He\r\ndrank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it\r\nthundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that Master Madden,\r\nbeing godly certain whiles, knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of\r\ndoom and Master Bloom, at the braggart’s side, spoke to him calming\r\nwords to slumber his great fear, advertising how it was no other thing\r\nbut a hubbub noise that he heard, the discharge of fluid from the\r\nthunderhead, look you, having taken place, and all of the order of a\r\nnatural phenomenon.\r\n\r\nBut was young Boasthard’s fear vanquished by Calmer’s words? No, for he\r\nhad in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be\r\ndone away. And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the\r\nother? He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either. But\r\ncould he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the\r\nbottle Holiness that then he lived withal? Indeed no for Grace was not\r\nthere to find that bottle. Heard he then in that clap the voice of the\r\ngod Bringforth or, what Calmer said, a hubbub of Phenomenon? Heard?\r\nWhy, he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube\r\nUnderstanding (which he had not done). For through that tube he saw\r\nthat he was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one\r\nday die as he was like the rest too a passing show. And would he not\r\naccept to die like the rest and pass away? By no means would he though\r\nhe must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives\r\nwhich Phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book Law. Then wotted\r\nhe nought of that other land which is called Believe-on-Me, that is the\r\nland of promise which behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for\r\never where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering\r\nat which all shall come as many as believe on it? Yes, Pious had told\r\nhim of that land and Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason\r\nwas that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing\r\nexterior whose name, she said, is Bird-in-the-Hand and she beguiled him\r\nwrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as,\r\nHo, you pretty man, turn aside hither and I will show you a brave\r\nplace, and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot\r\nwhich is named Two-in-the-Bush or, by some learned, Carnal\r\nConcupiscence.\r\n\r\nThis was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse of\r\nMothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore\r\nBird-in-the-Hand (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a\r\nwicked devil) they would strain the last but they would make at her and\r\nknow her. For regarding Believe-on-Me they said it was nought else but\r\nnotion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first,\r\nTwo-in-the-Bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and\r\nin it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words\r\nprinted on them, Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by\r\nJowl and, second, for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they\r\ncared not for them for Preservative had given them a stout shield of\r\noxengut and, third, that they might take no hurt neither from Offspring\r\nthat was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was\r\nnamed Killchild. So were they all in their blind fancy, Mr Cavil and Mr\r\nSometimes Godly, Mr Ape Swillale, Mr False Franklin, Mr Dainty Dixon,\r\nYoung Boasthard and Mr Cautious Calmer. Wherein, O wretched company,\r\nwere ye all deceived for that was the voice of the god that was in a\r\nvery grievous rage that he would presently lift his arm up and spill\r\ntheir souls for their abuses and their spillings done by them\r\ncontrariwise to his word which forth to bring brenningly biddeth.\r\n\r\nSo Thursday sixteenth June Patk. Dignam laid in clay of an apoplexy and\r\nafter hard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water a\r\nfifty mile or thereabout with turf saying the seed won’t sprout, fields\r\nathirst, very sadcoloured and stunk mightily, the quags and tofts too.\r\nHard to breathe and all the young quicks clean consumed without\r\nsprinkle this long while back as no man remembered to be without. The\r\nrosy buds all gone brown and spread out blobs and on the hills nought\r\nbut dry flag and faggots that would catch at first fire. All the world\r\nsaying, for aught they knew, the big wind of last February a year that\r\ndid havoc the land so pitifully a small thing beside this barrenness.\r\nBut by and by, as said, this evening after sundown, the wind sitting in\r\nthe west, biggish swollen clouds to be seen as the night increased and\r\nthe weatherwise poring up at them and some sheet lightnings at first\r\nand after, past ten of the clock, one great stroke with a long thunder\r\nand in a brace of shakes all scamper pellmell within door for the\r\nsmoking shower, the men making shelter for their straws with a clout or\r\nkerchief, womenfolk skipping off with kirtles catched up soon as the\r\npour came. In Ely place, Baggot street, Duke’s lawn, thence through\r\nMerrion green up to Holles street a swash of water flowing that was\r\nbefore bonedry and not one chair or coach or fiacre seen about but no\r\nmore crack after that first. Over against the Rt. Hon. Mr Justice\r\nFitzgibbon’s door (that is to sit with Mr Healy the lawyer upon the\r\ncollege lands) Mal. Mulligan a gentleman’s gentleman that had but come\r\nfrom Mr Moore’s the writer’s (that was a papish but is now, folk say, a\r\ngood Williamite) chanced against Alec. Bannon in a cut bob (which are\r\nnow in with dance cloaks of Kendal green) that was new got to town from\r\nMullingar with the stage where his coz and Mal M’s brother will stay a\r\nmonth yet till Saint Swithin and asks what in the earth he does there,\r\nhe bound home and he to Andrew Horne’s being stayed for to crush a cup\r\nof wine, so he said, but would tell him of a skittish heifer, big of\r\nher age and beef to the heel, and all this while poured with rain and\r\nso both together on to Horne’s. There Leop. Bloom of Crawford’s journal\r\nsitting snug with a covey of wags, likely brangling fellows, Dixon\r\njun., scholar of my lady of Mercy’s, Vin. Lynch, a Scots fellow, Will.\r\nMadden, T. Lenehan, very sad about a racer he fancied and Stephen D.\r\nLeop. Bloom there for a languor he had but was now better, he having\r\ndreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll with red slippers\r\non in a pair of Turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be\r\nfor a change and Mistress Purefoy there, that got in through pleading\r\nher belly, and now on the stools, poor body, two days past her term,\r\nthe midwives sore put to it and can’t deliver, she queasy for a bowl of\r\nriceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very\r\nheavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks, they\r\nsay, but God give her soon issue. ’Tis her ninth chick to live, I hear,\r\nand Lady day bit off her last chick’s nails that was then a twelvemonth\r\nand with other three all breastfed that died written out in a fair hand\r\nin the king’s bible. Her hub fifty odd and a methodist but takes the\r\nsacrament and is to be seen any fair sabbath with a pair of his boys\r\noff Bullock harbour dapping on the sound with a heavybraked reel or in\r\na punt he has trailing for flounder and pollock and catches a fine bag,\r\nI hear. In sum an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and\r\nwill much increase the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and\r\nwater fire shall come for a prognostication of Malachi’s almanac (and I\r\nhear that Mr Russell has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out\r\nof the Hindustanish for his farmer’s gazette) to have three things in\r\nall but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and\r\nbairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their\r\nqueerities no telling how.\r\n\r\nWith this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the\r\nletter was in that night’s gazette and he made a show to find it about\r\nhim (for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but\r\non Stephen’s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit\r\nnear by which he did mighty brisk. He was a kind of sport gentleman\r\nthat went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of\r\nwomen, horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat. To tell the truth he\r\nwas mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the\r\ncoffeehouses and low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul’s men,\r\nrunners, flatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues\r\nof the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at\r\nnights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much\r\nloose gossip. He took his ordinary at a boilingcook’s and if he had but\r\ngotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a\r\nbare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his\r\ntongue, some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every\r\nmother’s son of them would burst their sides. The other, Costello that\r\nis, hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale. Faith, no, he\r\nsays, Frank (that was his name), ’tis all about Kerry cows that are to\r\nbe butchered along of the plague. But they can go hang, says he with a\r\nwink, for me with their bully beef, a pox on it. There’s as good fish\r\nin this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take\r\nof some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the\r\nmeantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his\r\nembassy as he was sharpset. _Mort aux vaches_, says Frank then in the\r\nFrench language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a\r\nwinelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman too. From a\r\nchild this Frank had been a donought that his father, a headborough,\r\nwho could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of\r\nthe globes, matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but\r\nhe took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar\r\nwith the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes. One\r\ntime he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a welsher, then nought\r\nwould keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main, then he was for\r\nthe ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk,\r\nkidnapping a squire’s heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids’\r\nlinen or choking chicken behind a hedge. He had been off as many times\r\nas a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to\r\nhis father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw\r\nhim. What, says Mr Leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to\r\nknow the drift of it, will they slaughter all? I protest I saw them but\r\nthis day morning going to the Liverpool boats, says he. I can scarce\r\nbelieve ’tis so bad, says he. And he had experience of the like brood\r\nbeasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and wether wool, having been\r\nsome years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster\r\nthat drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by Mr\r\nGavin Low’s yard in Prussia street. I question with you there, says he.\r\nMore like ’tis the hoose or the timber tongue. Mr Stephen, a little\r\nmoved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had\r\ndispatches from the emperor’s chief tailtickler thanking him for the\r\nhospitality, that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest, the bestquoted\r\ncowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to take the\r\nbull by the horns. Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain dealing. He’ll\r\nfind himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that’s\r\nIrish, says he. Irish by name and irish by nature, says Mr Stephen, and\r\nhe sent the ale purling about, an Irish bull in an English chinashop. I\r\nconceive you, says Mr Dixon. It is that same bull that was sent to our\r\nisland by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them all, with\r\nan emerald ring in his nose. True for you, says Mr Vincent cross the\r\ntable, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a\r\nportlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock. He had horns galore, a\r\ncoat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his\r\nnostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and\r\nrollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains.\r\nWhat for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas\r\nthat was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who\r\nwere no better off than himself. So be off now, says he, and do all my\r\ncousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer’s blessing,\r\nand with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly. But the slap and\r\nthe blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he\r\ntaught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess\r\nand widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the\r\nmonth whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the\r\nnape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young\r\nravisher in the four fields of all Ireland. Another then put in his\r\nword: And they dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat\r\nwith a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his\r\nforelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables\r\nfor him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of\r\nthe best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his\r\nheart’s content. By this time the father of the faithful (for so they\r\ncalled him) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture. To\r\nremedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in\r\ntheir apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on\r\nhis hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow\r\nout of him in bulls’ language and they all after him. Ay, says another,\r\nand so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the\r\nland but green grass for himself (for that was the only colour to his\r\nmind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the\r\nisland with a printed notice, saying: By the Lord Harry, Green is the\r\ngrass that grows on the ground. And, says Mr Dixon, if ever he got\r\nscent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara or a\r\nhusbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or\r\na bag of rapeseed out he’d run amok over half the countryside rooting\r\nup with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord Harry’s orders.\r\nThere was bad blood between them at first, says Mr Vincent, and the\r\nlord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an\r\nold whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I’ll meddle in\r\nhis matters, says he. I’ll make that animal smell hell, says he, with\r\nthe help of that good pizzle my father left me. But one evening, says\r\nMr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to\r\ndinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself but the\r\nfirst rule of the course was that the others were to row with\r\npitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and\r\non picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he\r\nfound sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous\r\nchampion bull of the Romans, _Bos Bovum_, which is good bog Latin for\r\nboss of the show. After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his\r\nhead into a cow’s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers\r\nand pulling it out again told them all his new name. Then, with the\r\nwater running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had\r\nbelonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls’ language\r\nto study but he could never learn a word of it except the first\r\npersonal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if\r\never he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write\r\nit upon what took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or\r\na bale of cotton or a corkfloat. In short, he and the bull of Ireland\r\nwere soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt. They were, says Mr\r\nStephen, and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was\r\ntoward, as the ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft,\r\nloaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all\r\nmasts erect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread\r\nthree sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed\r\nanchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly Roger, gave three times\r\nthree, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea\r\nto recover the main of America. Which was the occasion, says Mr\r\nVincent, of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty:\r\n\r\n_—Pope Peter’s but a pissabed.\r\n\r\nA man’s a man for a’ that._\r\n\r\nOur worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway\r\nas the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend\r\nwhom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon,\r\nwho had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a\r\ncornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars. Mr Mulligan was civil\r\nenough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a\r\nproject of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched\r\non. Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards\r\nwhich he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell’s bearing a legend\r\nprinted in fair italics: _Mr Malachi Mulligan. Fertiliser and\r\nIncubator. Lambay Island_. His project, as he went on to expound, was\r\nto withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief\r\nbusiness of sir Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and\r\nto devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has\r\nbeen framed. Well, let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon. I\r\nmake no doubt it smacks of wenching. Come, be seated, both. ’Tis as\r\ncheap sitting as standing. Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and,\r\nexpatiating upon his design, told his hearers that he had been led into\r\nthis thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility, both the\r\ninhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were\r\ndue to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as\r\nwhether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from\r\nproclivities acquired. It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the\r\nnuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so\r\nmany agreeable females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest\r\nbonzes, who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial\r\ncloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some\r\nunaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness,\r\nsacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty\r\nfellows were at hand to caress, this, he assured them, made his heart\r\nweep. To curb this inconvenient (which he concluded due to a\r\nsuppression of latent heat), having advised with certain counsellors of\r\nworth and inspected into this matter, he had resolved to purchase in\r\nfee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holder, lord\r\nTalbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with our\r\nascendancy party. He proposed to set up there a national fertilising\r\nfarm to be named _Omphalos_ with an obelisk hewn and erected after the\r\nfashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the\r\nfecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there\r\ndirect to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her\r\nnatural. Money was no object, he said, nor would he take a penny for\r\nhis pains. The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of\r\nfashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm\r\npersuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man. For his\r\nnutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet\r\nof savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these\r\nlatter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both\r\nbroiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum\r\nchillies. After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of\r\nasseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief\r\nwith which he had shielded it. They both, it seems, had been overtaken\r\nby the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as\r\nmight be observed by Mr Mulligan’s smallclothes of a hodden grey which\r\nwas now somewhat piebald. His project meanwhile was very favourably\r\nentertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr\r\nDixon of Mary’s excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he\r\npurpose also to carry coals to Newcastle. Mr Mulligan however made\r\ncourt to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as\r\nit dwelt upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of\r\nhis contention: _Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites, ut\r\nmatresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici\r\ntitillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus\r\ncenturionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt_, while for those of ruder\r\nwit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more\r\nsuitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the\r\nfarmyard drake and duck.\r\n\r\nValuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper\r\nman of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with\r\nanimadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics\r\nwhile the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had\r\nadvanced. The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a\r\npassage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his\r\nnearest neighbour. Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for\r\nwhom were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him\r\na civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional\r\nassistance we could give? Who, upon his offer, thanked him very\r\nheartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he\r\nwas come there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne’s house, that was\r\nin an interesting condition, poor body, from woman’s woe (and here he\r\nfetched a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place. Mr\r\nDixon, to turn the table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether\r\nhis incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an\r\novoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due,\r\nas with the noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in the\r\nstomach. For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls,\r\nsmote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable\r\ndroll mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex\r\nthough ’tis pity she’s a trollop): There’s a belly that never bore a\r\nbastard. This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth\r\nand threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight.\r\nThe spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some\r\nlarum in the antechamber.\r\n\r\nHere the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little\r\nfume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion\r\nwith the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient\r\npoint, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the\r\nobligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by\r\na questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had\r\nnot achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but\r\ncontrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was\r\never done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it. _Mais bien\r\nsûr_, noble stranger, said he cheerily, _et mille compliments_. That\r\nyou may and very opportunely. There wanted nothing but this cup to\r\ncrown my felicity. But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in\r\nmy wallet and a cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept\r\nof them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give\r\nthanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver\r\nof good things. With these words he approached the goblet to his lips,\r\ntook a complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening\r\nhis bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very\r\npicture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein.\r\nGazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he\r\nsaid, had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting\r\ninstant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her\r\nfeastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so\r\nmelting a tenderness, ’pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been\r\nimpelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands\r\nof such an enemy or to quit the field for ever. I declare, I was never\r\nso touched in all my life. God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days!\r\nThrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her\r\nfavours. A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having\r\nreplaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again.\r\nBeneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great\r\nand universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in\r\nthrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished\r\ncoxcomb, the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of\r\nmaturer years. But indeed, sir, I wander from the point. How mingled\r\nand imperfect are all our sublunary joys. Maledicity! he exclaimed in\r\nanguish. Would to God that foresight had but remembered me to take my\r\ncloak along! I could weep to think of it. Then, though it had poured\r\nseven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse. But beshrew me,\r\nhe cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day\r\nand, thousand thunders, I know of a _marchand de capotes_, Monsieur\r\nPoyntz, from whom I can have for a _livre_ as snug a cloak of the\r\nFrench fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting. Tut, tut! cries Le\r\nFécondateur, tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that most\r\naccomplished traveller (I have just cracked a half bottle _avec lui_ in\r\na circle of the best wits of the town), is my authority that in Cape\r\nHorn, _ventre biche_, they have a rain that will wet through any, even\r\nthe stoutest cloak. A drenching of that violence, he tells me, _sans\r\nblague_, has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest\r\nposthaste to another world. Pooh! A _livre!_ cries Monsieur Lynch. The\r\nclumsy things are dear at a sou. One umbrella, were it no bigger than a\r\nfairy mushroom, is worth ten such stopgaps. No woman of any wit would\r\nwear one. My dear Kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge\r\nbefore ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for, as she\r\nreminded me (blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there\r\nwas none to snap her words but giddy butterflies), dame Nature, by the\r\ndivine blessing, has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a\r\nhousehold word that _il y a deux choses_ for which the innocence of our\r\noriginal garb, in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties, is\r\nthe fittest, nay, the only garment. The first, said she (and here my\r\npretty philosopher, as I handed her to her tilbury, to fix my\r\nattention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear),\r\nthe first is a bath... But at this point a bell tinkling in the hall\r\ncut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of\r\nour store of knowledge.\r\n\r\nAmid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while\r\nall were conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan entered and,\r\nhaving spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with\r\na profound bow to the company. The presence even for a moment among a\r\nparty of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and\r\nnot less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of\r\nthe most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of\r\nribaldry. Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled.\r\nA monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! I’ll be sworn she has rendezvoused\r\nyou. What, you dog? Have you a way with them? Gad’s bud, immensely so,\r\nsaid Mr Lynch. The bedside manner it is that they use in the Mater\r\nhospice. Demme, does not Doctor O’Gargle chuck the nuns there under the\r\nchin. As I look to be saved I had it from my Kitty who has been\r\nwardmaid there any time these seven months. Lawksamercy, doctor, cried\r\nthe young blood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and\r\nwith immodest squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! Drat the\r\nman! Bless me, I’m all of a wibbly wobbly. Why, you’re as bad as dear\r\nlittle Father Cantekissem, that you are! May this pot of four half\r\nchoke me, cried Costello, if she aint in the family way. I knows a lady\r\nwhat’s got a white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her. The young\r\nsurgeon, however, rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as\r\nthe nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward.\r\nMerciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings\r\nof the lady who was _enceinte_ which she had borne with a laudable\r\nfortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy. I want patience,\r\nsaid he, with those who, without wit to enliven or learning to\r\ninstruct, revile an ennobling profession which, saving the reverence\r\ndue to the Deity, is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth. I\r\nam positive when I say that if need were I could produce a cloud of\r\nwitnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which, so far\r\nfrom being a byword, should be a glorious incentive in the human\r\nbreast. I cannot away with them. What? Malign such an one, the amiable\r\nMiss Callan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of\r\nours? And at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child\r\nof clay? Perish the thought! I shudder to think of the future of a race\r\nwhere the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right\r\nreverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of Horne. Having\r\ndelivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and\r\nrepaired to the door. A murmur of approval arose from all and some were\r\nfor ejecting the low soaker without more ado, a design which would have\r\nbeen effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had\r\nhe not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid\r\nimprecation (for he swore a round hand) that he was as good a son of\r\nthe true fold as ever drew breath. Stap my vitals, said he, them was\r\nalways the sentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most\r\nparticular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand\r\nto a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what I always looks\r\nback on with a loving heart.\r\n\r\nTo revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of\r\nsome impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits\r\nof that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity.\r\nThe young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as\r\novergrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions were\r\ndifficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and\r\noutrageous _mots_ were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were\r\nthey scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of\r\nstrong animal spirits spoke in their behalf. But the word of Mr\r\nCostello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch\r\nthat seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born\r\nout of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into\r\nthe world, which the dint of the surgeon’s pliers in his skull lent\r\nindeed a colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of\r\ncreation’s chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin. It was\r\nnow for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had\r\npassed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a\r\nwary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his\r\nheart to repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting\r\nthem with the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that\r\nplenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn\r\nand all find tolerable and but tolerable. To those who create\r\nthemselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which\r\nhe never did hold with) to them he would concede neither to bear the\r\nname nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such\r\nthat, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the\r\nsharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a\r\nprecipitate and inglorious retreat. Not but what he could feel with\r\nmettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or the\r\ngruntlings of the severe, is ever (as the chaste fancy of the Holy\r\nWriter expresses it) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far\r\nforth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a\r\ngentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions. To conclude, while\r\nfrom the sister’s words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was,\r\nhowever, it must be owned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence\r\nthat the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now\r\ntestified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the\r\nSupreme Being.\r\n\r\nAccordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express\r\nhis notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to\r\nexpress one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid\r\ngenius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her\r\nconfinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers.\r\nThe dressy young blade said it was her husband’s that put her in that\r\nexpectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian\r\nmatron. I must acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the table\r\nso as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old Glory Allelujurum\r\nwas round again today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring\r\nthrough his nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he\r\ncalls her. I bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event\r\nwould burst anon. ’Slife, I’ll be round with you. I cannot but extol\r\nthe virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another\r\nchild out of her. All fell to praising of it, each after his own\r\nfashion, though the same young blade held with his former view that\r\nanother than her conjugial had been the man in the gap, a clerk in\r\norders, a linkboy (virtuous) or an itinerant vendor of articles needed\r\nin every household. Singular, communed the guest with himself, the\r\nwonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them, that\r\nthe puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the\r\nseminaries of such frivolity, that the mere acquisition of academic\r\ntitles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of\r\nlevity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise\r\neminent have esteemed the noblest. But, he further added, it is mayhap\r\nto relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for I have\r\nmore than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together.\r\n\r\nBut with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron,\r\nhas this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted\r\nto civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal\r\npolity? Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have\r\ncounselled? During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary\r\nadvantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that\r\nmoment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a\r\ntenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per\r\ncents? Has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received? Or is\r\nit that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own\r\ndupe as he is, if report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer?\r\nFar be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady,\r\nthe daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the most distant\r\nreflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it\r\nwas indeed highly his interest not to have done) then be it so. Unhappy\r\nwoman, she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate\r\nprerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than\r\nthe derision of the desperate. He says this, a censor of morals, a very\r\npelican in his piety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of\r\nnature, to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn\r\nfrom the lowest strata of society! Nay, had the hussy’s scouringbrush\r\nnot been her tutelary angel, it had gone with her as hard as with\r\nHagar, the Egyptian! In the question of the grazing lands his peevish\r\nasperity is notorious and in Mr Cuffe’s hearing brought upon him from\r\nan indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as\r\nstraightforward as they were bucolic. It ill becomes him to preach that\r\ngospel. Has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the\r\nwant of the ploughshare? A habit reprehensible at puberty is second\r\nnature and an opprobrium in middle life. If he must dispense his balm\r\nof Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to\r\nhealth a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist\r\nbetter with the doctrines that now engross him. His marital breast is\r\nthe repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce. The\r\nlewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort\r\nneglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of\r\nills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in its native\r\norient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but,\r\ntransplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their\r\nquondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant,\r\nacid and inoperative.\r\n\r\nThe news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial\r\nusage of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the\r\njunior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the\r\ndelegation that an heir had been born. When he had betaken himself to\r\nthe women’s apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the\r\nafterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic\r\naffairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous\r\nexhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and\r\nsolemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would\r\npalliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and\r\nobstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of\r\ntongues. In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring\r\nto urge, to mollify, to refrain. The moment was too propitious for the\r\ndisplay of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union\r\namong tempers so divergent. Every phase of the situation was\r\nsuccessively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers,\r\nthe Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that\r\nrarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as\r\nthe Childs Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr\r\nAdvocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused,\r\nthe rights of primogeniture and king’s bounty touching twins and\r\ntriplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the\r\nacardiac _foetus in foetu_ and aprosopia due to a congestion, the\r\nagnathia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan)\r\nin consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the\r\nmedial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other\r\nspoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation\r\nof labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the\r\nvein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in\r\nthe actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix,\r\nartificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb\r\nconsequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the\r\nspecies in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that\r\ndistressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers\r\n_Sturzgeburt,_ the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and\r\nmonstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of\r\nconsanguineous parents—in a word all the cases of human nativity which\r\nAristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic\r\nillustrations. The gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine\r\nwere examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the\r\nstate of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step\r\nover a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should\r\nstrangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a\r\nyearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand\r\nagainst that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the\r\nseat of castigation. The abnormalities of harelip, breastmole,\r\nsupernumerary digits, negro’s inkle, strawberry mark and portwine stain\r\nwere alleged by one as a _prima facie_ and natural hypothetical\r\nexplanation of those swineheaded (the case of Madame Grissel Steevens\r\nwas not forgotten) or doghaired infants occasionally born. The\r\nhypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the Caledonian envoy and\r\nworthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for,\r\nenvisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some\r\nstage antecedent to the human. An outlandish delegate sustained against\r\nboth these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction, the\r\ntheory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his\r\nauthority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of\r\nthe Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down\r\nto us in the pages of his Metamorphoses. The impression made by his\r\nwords was immediate but shortlived. It was effaced as easily as it had\r\nbeen evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of\r\npleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as\r\nthe supremest object of desire a nice clean old man. Contemporaneously,\r\na heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr\r\nCandidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created\r\nin the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty\r\nby mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant\r\nsubmittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus. Hitherto silent, whether the\r\nbetter to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the\r\ngarb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he\r\ndelivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the\r\necclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has\r\njoined.\r\n\r\nBut Malachias’ tale began to freeze them with horror. He conjured up\r\nthe scene before them. The secret panel beside the chimney slid back\r\nand in the recess appeared... Haines! Which of us did not feel his\r\nflesh creep! He had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand,\r\nin the other a phial marked _Poison._ Surprise, horror, loathing were\r\ndepicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin. I\r\nanticipated some such reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for\r\nwhich, it seems, history is to blame. Yes, it is true. I am the\r\nmurderer of Samuel Childs. And how I am punished! The inferno has no\r\nterrors for me. This is the appearance is on me. Tare and ages, what\r\nway would I be resting at all, he muttered thickly, and I tramping\r\nDublin this while back with my share of songs and himself after me the\r\nlike of a soulth or a bullawurrus? My hell, and Ireland’s, is in this\r\nlife. It is what I tried to obliterate my crime. Distractions,\r\nrookshooting, the Erse language (he recited some), laudanum (he raised\r\nthe phial to his lips), camping out. In vain! His spectre stalks me.\r\nDope is my only hope... Ah! Destruction! The black panther! With a cry\r\nhe suddenly vanished and the panel slid back. An instant later his head\r\nappeared in the door opposite and said: Meet me at Westland Row station\r\nat ten past eleven. He was gone. Tears gushed from the eyes of the\r\ndissipated host. The seer raised his hand to heaven, murmuring: The\r\nvendetta of Mananaun! The sage repeated: _Lex talionis_. The\r\nsentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense\r\ndebtorship for a thing done. Malachias, overcome by emotion, ceased.\r\nThe mystery was unveiled. Haines was the third brother. His real name\r\nwas Childs. The black panther was himself the ghost of his own father.\r\nHe drank drugs to obliterate. For this relief much thanks. The lonely\r\nhouse by the graveyard is uninhabited. No soul will live there. The\r\nspider pitches her web in the solitude. The nocturnal rat peers from\r\nhis hole. A curse is on it. It is haunted. Murderer’s ground.\r\n\r\nWhat is the age of the soul of man? As she hath the virtue of the\r\nchameleon to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the\r\nmerry and mournful with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as\r\nher mood. No longer is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing\r\nthe cud of reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a\r\nmodest substance in the funds. A score of years are blown away. He is\r\nyoung Leopold. There, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror\r\nwithin a mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself. That young figure\r\nof then is seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from\r\nthe old house in Clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel\r\non him bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a\r\nmother’s thought. Or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in\r\nhis first hard hat (ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a\r\nfullfledged traveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook,\r\na scented handkerchief (not for show only), his case of bright\r\ntrinketware (alas! a thing now of the past!) and a quiverful of\r\ncompliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out\r\nupon her fingertips or for a budding virgin, shyly acknowledging (but\r\nthe heart? tell me!) his studied baisemoins. The scent, the smile, but,\r\nmore than these, the dark eyes and oleaginous address, brought home at\r\nduskfall many a commission to the head of the firm, seated with Jacob’s\r\npipe after like labours in the paternal ingle (a meal of noodles, you\r\nmay be sure, is aheating), reading through round horned spectacles some\r\npaper from the Europe of a month before. But hey, presto, the mirror is\r\nbreathed on and the young knighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to a\r\ntiny speck within the mist. Now he is himself paternal and these about\r\nhim might be his sons. Who can say? The wise father knows his own\r\nchild. He thinks of a drizzling night in Hatch street, hard by the\r\nbonded stores there, the first. Together (she is a poor waif, a child\r\nof shame, yours and mine and of all for a bare shilling and her\r\nluckpenny), together they hear the heavy tread of the watch as two\r\nraincaped shadows pass the new royal university. Bridie! Bridie Kelly!\r\nHe will never forget the name, ever remember the night: first night,\r\nthe bridenight. They are entwined in nethermost darkness, the willer\r\nwith the willed, and in an instant (_fiat!_) light shall flood the\r\nworld. Did heart leap to heart? Nay, fair reader. In a breath ’twas\r\ndone but—hold! Back! It must not be! In terror the poor girl flees away\r\nthrough the murk. She is the bride of darkness, a daughter of night.\r\nShe dare not bear the sunnygolden babe of day. No, Leopold. Name and\r\nmemory solace thee not. That youthful illusion of thy strength was\r\ntaken from thee—and in vain. No son of thy loins is by thee. There is\r\nnone now to be for Leopold, what Leopold was for Rudolph.\r\n\r\nThe voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the\r\ninfinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over\r\nregions of cycles of generations that have lived. A region where grey\r\ntwilight ever descends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields,\r\nshedding her dusk, scattering a perennial dew of stars. She follows her\r\nmother with ungainly steps, a mare leading her fillyfoal. Twilight\r\nphantoms are they, yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim\r\nshapely haunches, a supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull.\r\nThey fade, sad phantoms: all is gone. Agendath is a waste land, a home\r\nof screechowls and the sandblind upupa. Netaim, the golden, is no more.\r\nAnd on the highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of\r\nrebellion, the ghosts of beasts. Huuh! Hark! Huuh! Parallax stalks\r\nbehind and goads them, the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are\r\nscorpions. Elk and yak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and\r\nmastodon, they come trooping to the sunken sea, _Lacus Mortis_. Ominous\r\nrevengeful zodiacal host! They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned\r\nand capricorned, the trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned, the\r\ngiantantlered, snouter and crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all\r\ntheir moving moaning multitude, murderers of the sun.\r\n\r\nOnward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible\r\ngulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood. And the equine\r\nportent grows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven’s\r\nown magnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo. And lo,\r\nwonder of metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger\r\nof the daystar, the bride, ever virgin. It is she, Martha, thou lost\r\none, Millicent, the young, the dear, the radiant. How serene does she\r\nnow arise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan\r\nhour, shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do you\r\ncall it gossamer. It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and\r\nloose it streams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on\r\ncurrents of the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply\r\nswirling, writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a\r\nmyriad metamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangled\r\nsign upon the forehead of Taurus.\r\n\r\nFrancis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at\r\nschool together in Conmee’s time. He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades,\r\nPisistratus. Where were they now? Neither knew. You have spoken of the\r\npast and its phantoms, Stephen said. Why think of them? If I call them\r\ninto life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to\r\nmy call? Who supposes it? I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending\r\nbard, am lord and giver of their life. He encircled his gadding hair\r\nwith a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent. That answer and those\r\nleaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something\r\nmore, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your\r\ngenius father. All who wish you well hope this for you. All desire to\r\nsee you bring forth the work you meditate, to acclaim you\r\nStephaneforos. I heartily wish you may not fail them. O no, Vincent\r\nLenehan said, laying a hand on the shoulder near him. Have no fear. He\r\ncould not leave his mother an orphan. The young man’s face grew dark.\r\nAll could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and\r\nof his recent loss. He would have withdrawn from the feast had not the\r\nnoise of voices allayed the smart. Madden had lost five drachmas on\r\nSceptre for a whim of the rider’s name: Lenehan as much more. He told\r\nthem of the race. The flag fell and, huuh! off, scamper, the mare ran\r\nout freshly with O. Madden up. She was leading the field. All hearts\r\nwere beating. Even Phyllis could not contain herself. She waved her\r\nscarf and cried: Huzzah! Sceptre wins! But in the straight on the run\r\nhome when all were in close order the dark horse Throwaway drew level,\r\nreached, outstripped her. All was lost now. Phyllis was silent: her\r\neyes were sad anemones. Juno, she cried, I am undone. But her lover\r\nconsoled her and brought her a bright casket of gold in which lay some\r\noval sugarplums which she partook. A tear fell: one only. A whacking\r\nfine whip, said Lenehan, is W. Lane. Four winners yesterday and three\r\ntoday. What rider is like him? Mount him on the camel or the boisterous\r\nbuffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his. But let us bear it\r\nas was the ancient wont. Mercy on the luckless! Poor Sceptre! he said\r\nwith a light sigh. She is not the filly that she was. Never, by this\r\nhand, shall we behold such another. By gad, sir, a queen of them. Do\r\nyou remember her, Vincent? I wish you could have seen my queen today,\r\nVincent said. How young she was and radiant (Lalage were scarce fair\r\nbeside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin, I do not know the\r\nright name of it. The chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom: the air\r\ndrooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us. In\r\nthe sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of\r\nthose buns with Corinth fruit in them that Periplipomenes sells in his\r\nbooth near the bridge. But she had nought for her teeth but the arm\r\nwith which I held her and in that she nibbled mischievously when I\r\npressed too close. A week ago she lay ill, four days on the couch, but\r\ntoday she was free, blithe, mocked at peril. She is more taking then.\r\nHer posies too! Mad romp that she is, she had pulled her fill as we\r\nreclined together. And in your ear, my friend, you will not think who\r\nmet us as we left the field. Conmee himself! He was walking by the\r\nhedge, reading, I think a brevier book with, I doubt not, a witty\r\nletter in it from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page. The sweet creature\r\nturned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a slight\r\ndisorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the very\r\ntrees adore her. When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo\r\nin that little mirror she carries. But he had been kind. In going by he\r\nhad blessed us. The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said. If I had poor\r\nluck with Bass’s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more\r\npropensely. He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and\r\nwithheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label.\r\nWarily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence. His soul is far\r\naway. It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be\r\nborn. Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the\r\nincorruptible eon of the gods. Do you not think it, Stephen? Theosophos\r\ntold me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian\r\npriests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law. The lords of the\r\nmoon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha of\r\nthe lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were\r\ntherefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second\r\nconstellation.\r\n\r\nHowever, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him\r\nbeing in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which\r\nwas entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was\r\nnot the case at all. The individual whose visual organs while the above\r\nwas going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of\r\nanimation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody\r\nthat conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty\r\nspeedily in the wrong shop. During the past four minutes or thereabouts\r\nhe had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled\r\nby Messrs Bass and Co at Burton-on-Trent which happened to be situated\r\namongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was\r\ncertainly calculated to attract anyone’s remark on account of its\r\nscarlet appearance. He was simply and solely, as it subsequently\r\ntranspired for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an\r\naltogether different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment\r\nbefore’s observations about boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two\r\nor three private transactions of his own which the other two were as\r\nmutually innocent of as the babe unborn. Eventually, however, both\r\ntheir eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other\r\nwas endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily\r\ndetermined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the\r\nneck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid\r\nsought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out\r\nwith, also at the same time, however, a considerable degree of\r\nattentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it\r\nabout the place.\r\n\r\nThe debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the\r\ncourse of life. Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity. The\r\ndebaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on\r\nthe loftiest and most vital. The high hall of Horne’s house had never\r\nbeheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old\r\nrafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so\r\nencyclopaedic. A gallant scene in truth it made. Crotthers was there at\r\nthe foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing\r\nfrom the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway. There too, opposite to\r\nhim, was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early\r\ndepravity and premature wisdom. Next the Scotchman was the place\r\nassigned to Costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in\r\nstolid repose the squat form of Madden. The chair of the resident\r\nindeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the\r\nfigure of Bannon in explorer’s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide\r\nbrogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred\r\nmanners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan. Lastly at the head of the\r\nboard was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of\r\npedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of\r\nSocratic discussion, while to right and left of him were accommodated\r\nthe flippant prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and that\r\nvigilant wanderer, soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained\r\nby the mire of an indelible dishonour, but from whose steadfast and\r\nconstant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever\r\nefface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired\r\npencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come.\r\n\r\nIt had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted\r\ntranscendentalism to which Mr S. Dedalus’ (Div. Scep.) contentions\r\nwould appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter\r\nto accepted scientific methods. Science, it cannot be too often\r\nrepeated, deals with tangible phenomena. The man of science like the\r\nman in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked\r\nand explain them as best he can. There may be, it is true, some\r\nquestions which science cannot answer—at present—such as the first\r\nproblem submitted by Mr L. Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) regarding the future\r\ndetermination of sex. Must we accept the view of Empedocles of\r\nTrinacria that the right ovary (the postmenstrual period, assert\r\nothers) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long\r\nneglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is\r\nit, as most embryologists incline to opine, such as Culpepper,\r\nSpallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and Valenti, a mixture\r\nof both? This would be tantamount to a cooperation (one of nature’s\r\nfavourite devices) between the _nisus formativus_ of the nemasperm on\r\nthe one hand and on the other a happily chosen position, _succubitus\r\nfelix_, of the passive element. The other problem raised by the same\r\ninquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality. It is interesting\r\nbecause, as he pertinently remarks, we are all born in the same way but\r\nwe all die in different ways. Mr M. Mulligan (Hyg. et Eug. Doc.) blames\r\nthe sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract\r\nadenoids, pulmonary complaints etc. by inhaling the bacteria which lurk\r\nin dust. These factors, he alleged, and the revolting spectacles\r\noffered by our streets, hideous publicity posters, religious ministers\r\nof all denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors, exposed scorbutic\r\ncardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals, paranoic bachelors\r\nand unfructified duennas—these, he said, were accountable for any and\r\nevery fallingoff in the calibre of the race. Kalipedia, he prophesied,\r\nwould soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life, genuinely\r\ngood music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive\r\npictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as\r\nVenus and Apollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all\r\nthese little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular\r\ncondition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner. Mr\r\nJ. Crotthers (Disc. Bacc.) attributes some of these demises to\r\nabdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy\r\nlabours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by\r\nfar the vast majority to neglect, private or official, culminating in\r\nthe exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal abortion or\r\nin the atrocious crime of infanticide. Although the former (we are\r\nthinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of\r\nnurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too\r\nrare to be normative. In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder\r\nis that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do,\r\nall things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which\r\noften baulk nature in her intentions. An ingenious suggestion is that\r\nthrown out by Mr V. Lynch (Bacc. Arith.) that both natality and\r\nmortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal\r\nmovements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general,\r\neverything, in fine, in nature’s vast workshop from the extinction of\r\nsome remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which\r\nbeautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet\r\nunascertained. Still the plain straightforward question why a child of\r\nnormally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly\r\nlooked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood (though other\r\nchildren of the same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet’s\r\nwords, give us pause. Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and\r\ncogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths\r\nare due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous\r\ngerms have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusively\r\nshown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend\r\nto disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an\r\narrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings\r\n(notably the maternal), is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long\r\nrun beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival\r\nof the fittest. Mr S. Dedalus’ (Div. Scep.) remark (or should it be\r\ncalled an interruption?) that an omnivorous being which can masticate,\r\ndeglute, digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with\r\npluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous\r\nfemales emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not\r\nto speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly\r\nfind gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals\r\nas nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above\r\nalluded to. For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately\r\nacquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this\r\nmorbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening\r\nbumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid\r\nfrom an alkali prides himself on being, it should perhaps be stated\r\nthat staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed\r\nvictuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly\r\ndropped from its mother. In a recent public controversy with Mr L.\r\nBloom (Pubb. Canv.) which took place in the commons’ hall of the\r\nNational Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, of which, as\r\nis well known, Dr A. Horne (Lic. in Midw., F. K. Q. C. P. I.) is the\r\nable and popular master, he is reported by eyewitnesses as having\r\nstated that once a woman has let the cat into the bag (an esthete’s\r\nallusion, presumably, to one of the most complicated and marvellous of\r\nall nature’s processes—the act of sexual congress) she must let it out\r\nagain or give it life, as he phrased it, to save her own. At the risk\r\nof her own, was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor, none the\r\nless effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was\r\ndelivered.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a\r\nhappy _accouchement._ It had been a weary weary while both for patient\r\nand doctor. All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave\r\nwoman had manfully helped. She had. She had fought the good fight and\r\nnow she was very very happy. Those who have passed on, who have gone\r\nbefore, are happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching\r\nscene. Reverently look at her as she reclines there with the\r\nmotherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty\r\nsight it is to see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood,\r\nbreathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal\r\nHusband. And as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one\r\nblessing more, to have her dear Doady there with her to share her joy,\r\nto lay in his arms that mite of God’s clay, the fruit of their lawful\r\nembraces. He is older now (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle\r\nstooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave dignity\r\nhas come to the conscientious second accountant of the Ulster bank,\r\nCollege Green branch. O Doady, loved one of old, faithful lifemate now,\r\nit may never be again, that faroff time of the roses! With the old\r\nshake of her pretty head she recalls those days. God! How beautiful now\r\nacross the mist of years! But their children are grouped in her\r\nimagination about the bedside, hers and his, Charley, Mary Alice,\r\nFrederick Albert (if he had lived), Mamy, Budgy (Victoria Frances),\r\nTom, Violet Constance Louisa, darling little Bobsy (called after our\r\nfamous hero of the South African war, lord Bobs of Waterford and\r\nCandahar) and now this last pledge of their union, a Purefoy if ever\r\nthere was one, with the true Purefoy nose. Young hopeful will be\r\nchristened Mortimer Edward after the influential third cousin of Mr\r\nPurefoy in the Treasury Remembrancer’s office, Dublin Castle. And so\r\ntime wags on: but father Cronion has dealt lightly here. No, let no\r\nsigh break from that bosom, dear gentle Mina. And Doady, knock the\r\nashes from your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the\r\ncurfew rings for you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light\r\nwhereby you read in the Sacred Book for the oil too has run low, and so\r\nwith a tranquil heart to bed, to rest. He knows and will call in His\r\nown good time. You too have fought the good fight and played loyally\r\nyour man’s part. Sir, to you my hand. Well done, thou good and faithful\r\nservant!\r\n\r\nThere are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil\r\nmemories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the\r\nheart but they abide there and wait. He may suffer their memory to grow\r\ndim, let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade\r\nhimself that they were not or at least were otherwise. Yet a chance\r\nword will call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront\r\nhim in the most various circumstances, a vision or a dream, or while\r\ntimbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility\r\nof the evening or at the feast, at midnight, when he is now filled with\r\nwine. Not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies\r\nunder her wrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but\r\nshrouded in the piteous vesture of the past, silent, remote,\r\nreproachful.\r\n\r\nThe stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of\r\nthat false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied\r\ntrick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an\r\nunhealthiness, a _flair,_ for the cruder things of life. A scene\r\ndisengages itself in the observer’s memory, evoked, it would seem, by a\r\nword of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present\r\nthere (as some thought) with their immediate pleasures. A shaven space\r\nof lawn one soft May evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at\r\nRoundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender spectators of the game\r\nbut with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward\r\nover the sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief\r\nalert shock. And yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at\r\ntimes in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood,\r\nFloey, Atty, Tiny and their darker friend with I know not what of\r\narresting in her pose then, Our Lady of the Cherries, a comely brace of\r\nthem pendent from an ear, bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin\r\nso daintily against the cool ardent fruit. A lad of four or five in\r\nlinseywoolsey (blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth\r\nwhen ere long the bowls are gathered and hutched) is standing on the\r\nurn secured by that circle of girlish fond hands. He frowns a little\r\njust as this young man does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment\r\nof the danger but must needs glance at whiles towards where his mother\r\nwatches from the _piazzetta_ giving upon the flowerclose with a faint\r\nshadow of remoteness or of reproach (_alles Vergängliche_) in her glad\r\nlook.\r\n\r\nMark this farther and remember. The end comes suddenly. Enter that\r\nantechamber of birth where the studious are assembled and note their\r\nfaces. Nothing, as it seems, there of rash or violent. Quietude of\r\ncustody, rather, befitting their station in that house, the vigilant\r\nwatch of shepherds and of angels about a crib in Bethlehem of Juda long\r\nago. But as before the lightning the serried stormclouds, heavy with\r\npreponderant excess of moisture, in swollen masses turgidly distended,\r\ncompass earth and sky in one vast slumber, impending above parched\r\nfield and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and verdure till in\r\nan instant a flash rives their centres and with the reverberation of\r\nthe thunder the cloudburst pours its torrent, so and not otherwise was\r\nthe transformation, violent and instantaneous, upon the utterance of\r\nthe word.\r\n\r\nBurke’s! outflings my lord Stephen, giving the cry, and a tag and\r\nbobtail of all them after, cockerel, jackanapes, welsher, pilldoctor,\r\npunctual Bloom at heels with a universal grabbing at headgear,\r\nashplants, bilbos, Panama hats and scabbards, Zermatt alpenstocks and\r\nwhat not. A dedale of lusty youth, noble every student there. Nurse\r\nCallan taken aback in the hallway cannot stay them nor smiling surgeon\r\ncoming downstairs with news of placentation ended, a full pound if a\r\nmilligramme. They hark him on. The door! It is open? Ha! They are out,\r\ntumultuously, off for a minute’s race, all bravely legging it, Burke’s\r\nof Denzille and Holles their ulterior goal. Dixon follows giving them\r\nsharp language but raps out an oath, he too, and on. Bloom stays with\r\nnurse a thought to send a kind word to happy mother and nurseling up\r\nthere. Doctor Diet and Doctor Quiet. Looks she too not other now? Ward\r\nof watching in Horne’s house has told its tale in that washedout\r\npallor. Then all being gone, a glance of motherwit helping, he whispers\r\nclose in going: Madam, when comes the storkbird for thee?\r\n\r\nThe air without is impregnated with raindew moisture, life essence\r\ncelestial, glistening on Dublin stone there under starshiny _coelum._\r\nGod’s air, the Allfather’s air, scintillant circumambient cessile air.\r\nBreathe it deep into thee. By heaven, Theodore Purefoy, thou hast done\r\na doughty deed and no botch! Thou art, I vow, the remarkablest\r\nprogenitor barring none in this chaffering allincluding most\r\nfarraginous chronicle. Astounding! In her lay a Godframed Godgiven\r\npreformed possibility which thou hast fructified with thy modicum of\r\nman’s work. Cleave to her! Serve! Toil on, labour like a very bandog\r\nand let scholarment and all Malthusiasts go hang. Thou art all their\r\ndaddies, Theodore. Art drooping under thy load, bemoiled with butcher’s\r\nbills at home and ingots (not thine!) in the countinghouse? Head up!\r\nFor every newbegotten thou shalt gather thy homer of ripe wheat. See,\r\nthy fleece is drenched. Dost envy Darby Dullman there with his Joan? A\r\ncanting jay and a rheumeyed curdog is all their progeny. Pshaw, I tell\r\nthee! He is a mule, a dead gasteropod, without vim or stamina, not\r\nworth a cracked kreutzer. Copulation without population! No, say I!\r\nHerod’s slaughter of the innocents were the truer name. Vegetables,\r\nforsooth, and sterile cohabitation! Give her beefsteaks, red, raw,\r\nbleeding! She is a hoary pandemonium of ills, enlarged glands, mumps,\r\nquinsy, bunions, hayfever, bedsores, ringworm, floating kidney,\r\nDerbyshire neck, warts, bilious attacks, gallstones, cold feet,\r\nvaricose veins. A truce to threnes and trentals and jeremies and all\r\nsuch congenital defunctive music! Twenty years of it, regret them not.\r\nWith thee it was not as with many that will and would and wait and\r\nnever—do. Thou sawest thy America, thy lifetask, and didst charge to\r\ncover like the transpontine bison. How saith Zarathustra? _Deine Kuh\r\nTrübsal melkest Du. Nun Trinkst Du die süsse Milch des Euters_. See! it\r\ndisplodes for thee in abundance. Drink, man, an udderful! Mother’s\r\nmilk, Purefoy, the milk of human kin, milk too of those burgeoning\r\nstars overhead rutilant in thin rainvapour, punch milk, such as those\r\nrioters will quaff in their guzzling den, milk of madness, the\r\nhoneymilk of Canaan’s land. Thy cow’s dug was tough, what? Ay, but her\r\nmilk is hot and sweet and fattening. No dollop this but thick rich\r\nbonnyclaber. To her, old patriarch!

Killing simply. _(She\r\nputs out her hand inquisitively.)_ What are you hiding behind your\r\nback? Tell us, there’s a dear.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: _(Seizes her wrist with his free hand.)_ Josie Powell that was,\r\nprettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by!

I scolded that tramdriver on\r\nHarold’s cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness\r\nscab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the\r\nlast tram.

Block tackle and a strangling pulley will bring your\r\nlion to heel, no matter how fractious, even _Leo ferox_ there, the\r\nLibyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the\r\nburning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. _(He\r\nglares.)_ I possess the Indian sign.

I live in Eccles street.\r\nMy wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant\r\nupstanding gentleman, what do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy,\r\none of Britain’s fighting men who helped to win our battles.

No born gentleman, no-one with the most\r\nrudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly\r\nloathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak\r\nmasquerading as a literateur. It’s perfectly obvious that with the most\r\ninherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling copy, really\r\ngorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath\r\nsuspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions, with which\r\nyour lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout\r\nthe kingdom.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: _(Murmurs with hangdog meekness glum.)_ That bit about the\r\nlaughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may...\r\n\r\nBEAUFOY: _(His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.)_ You\r\nfunny ass, you!

And he interfered twict with my clothing.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: She counterassaulted.\r\n\r\nMARY DRISCOLL: _(Scornfully.)_ I had more respect for the\r\nscouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, Your lord, and he\r\nremarked: keep it quiet.\r\n\r\n_(General laughter.)_\r\n\r\nGEORGE FOTTRELL: _(Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.)_ Order in\r\ncourt!

They would hear what counsel had to say\r\nin his stirring address to the grand jury. He was down and out but,\r\nthough branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to\r\nreform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and\r\nreturn to nature as a purely domestic animal. A sevenmonths’ child, he\r\nhad been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent.\r\nThere might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn\r\nover a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping\r\npost, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by\r\nthe affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An\r\nacclimatised Britisher, he had seen that summer eve from the footplate\r\nof an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain\r\nrefrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of\r\nloveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly\r\nrural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell’s wallpaper at one\r\nand ninepence a dozen, innocent Britishborn bairns lisping prayers to\r\nthe Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums or\r\nmodel young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour\r\nreciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the\r\nboreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what\r\ntimes the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with\r\nfour acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain\r\never...._\r\n\r\n_(Renewed laughter.

O’MOLLOY: _(In barrister’s grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with\r\na voice of pained protest.)_ This is no place for indecent levity at\r\nthe expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a\r\nbeargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My\r\nclient is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a\r\nstowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up\r\nmisdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on\r\nby hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence\r\nbeing quite permitted in my client’s native place, the land of the\r\nPharaoh. _Prima facie_, I put it to you that there was no attempt at\r\ncarnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of\r\nby Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would\r\ndeal in especial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and\r\nsomnambulism in my client’s family. If the accused could speak he could\r\na tale unfold—one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between\r\nthe covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from\r\ncobbler’s weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian\r\nextraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: _(Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar’s vest and trousers,\r\napologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole’s eyes and looks about\r\nhim dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches\r\nhis belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes\r\nthe court, pointing one thumb heavenward.)_ Him makee velly muchee fine\r\nnight. _(He begins to lilt simply.)_\r\n\r\n Li li poo lil chile\r\n Blingee pigfoot evly night\r\n Payee two shilly...\r\n\r\n_(He is howled down.)_\r\n\r\nJ. J. O’MOLLOY: _(Hotly to the populace.)_ This is a lonehand fight. By\r\nHades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this\r\nfashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has\r\nsuperseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically,\r\nwithout wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused\r\nwas not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered\r\nwith. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very\r\nown daughter. _(Bloom takes J. J. O’Molloy’s hand and raises it to his\r\nlips.)_ I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that\r\nthe hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute\r\nBloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the\r\nworld to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object\r\nto or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some\r\ndastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will\r\non her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I\r\nknow. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his\r\nextensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of\r\nwhich will now be shown. _(To Bloom.)_ I suggest that you will do the\r\nhandsome thing.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: A penny in the pound.\r\n\r\n_(The image of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in\r\nsilver haze is projected on the wall.

He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless\r\nglobes as I sat in a box of the _Theatre Royal_ at a command\r\nperformance of _La Cigale_. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made\r\nimproper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on\r\nthe following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the\r\npost a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled _The Girl\r\nwith the Three Pairs of Stays_.\r\n\r\nMRS BELLINGHAM: _(In cap and seal coney mantle, wrapped up to the nose,\r\nsteps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell\r\nquizzing-glasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.)_\r\nAlso to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because\r\nhe closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker’s one sleety day\r\nduring the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the\r\nwastepipe and the ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently\r\nhe enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in\r\nmy honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the\r\ninformation that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant\r\npurloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.\r\n\r\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY: Shame on him!\r\n\r\n_(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins surges forward.)_\r\n\r\nTHE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS: _(Screaming.)_ Stop thief! Hurrah there,\r\nBluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!\r\n\r\nSECOND WATCH: _(Produces handcuffs.)_ Here are the darbies.\r\n\r\nMRS BELLINGHAM: He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome\r\ncompliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my\r\nfrostbound coachman Palmer while in the same breath he expressed\r\nhimself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his\r\nfortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing\r\nmy livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon\r\ngarnished sable, a buck’s head couped or. He lauded almost\r\nextravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose\r\ndrawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden\r\ntreasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He\r\nurged me (Stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me.) to\r\ndefile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: _(In amazon costume, hard hat,\r\njackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets\r\nwith braided drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she\r\nstrikes her welt constantly.)_ Also me. Because he saw me on the polo\r\nground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of\r\nIreland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger\r\nDennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob\r\n_Centaur._ This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car\r\nand sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold\r\nafter dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still.\r\nIt represents a partially nude señorita, frail and lovely (his wife, as\r\nhe solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit\r\nintercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me\r\nto do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He\r\nimplored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise\r\nhim as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most\r\nvicious horsewhipping.\r\n\r\nMRS BELLINGHAM: Me too.\r\n\r\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY: Me too.\r\n\r\n_(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters\r\nreceived from Bloom.)_\r\n\r\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: _(Stamps her jingling spurs in a\r\nsudden paroxysm of fury.)_ I will, by the God above me. I’ll scourge\r\nthe pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I’ll flay him\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: _(His eyes closing, quails expectantly.)_ Here? _(He squirms.)_\r\nAgain! _(He pants cringing.)_ I love the danger.\r\n\r\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: Very much so! I’ll make it hot for\r\nyou. I’ll make you dance Jack Latten for that.\r\n\r\nMRS BELLINGHAM: Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and\r\nstripes on it!\r\n\r\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY: Disgraceful! There’s no excuse for him! A married\r\nman!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm\r\ntingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: _(Laughs derisively.)_ O, did you,\r\nmy fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you’ll get the surprise of\r\nyour life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever\r\nbargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into\r\nfury.\r\n\r\nMRS BELLINGHAM: _(Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.)_\r\nMake him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within\r\nan inch of his life. The cat-o’-nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: _(Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands: with hangdog mien.)_ O\r\ncold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet.\r\nLet me off this once. _(He offers the other cheek.)_\r\n\r\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY: _(Severely.)_ Don’t do so on any account, Mrs\r\nTalboys! He should be soundly trounced!\r\n\r\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: _(Unbuttoning her gauntlet\r\nviolently.)_ I’ll do no such thing. Pigdog and always was ever since he\r\nwas pupped! To dare address me! I’ll flog him black and blue in the\r\npublic streets. I’ll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a\r\nwellknown cuckold. _(She swishes her huntingcrop savagely in the air.)_\r\nTake down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir!

A streamer bearing the legends_ Cead Mile Failte _and_ Mah Ttob\r\nMelek Israel _spans the street. All the windows are thronged with\r\nsightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the Royal\r\nDublin Fusiliers, the King’s own Scottish Borderers, the Cameron\r\nHighlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back\r\nthe crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts,\r\ntelegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings,\r\nrainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A\r\nfife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The\r\nbeaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and\r\nwaving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high,\r\nsurrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession\r\nappears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard\r\ntabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms.

He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace’s\r\nprivate asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary\r\nepilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of\r\nelephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are\r\nmarked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent.\r\nHe is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in\r\nconsequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a\r\nfamily complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to\r\nbe more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal\r\nexamination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal,\r\naxillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be _virgo\r\nintacta._\r\n\r\n_(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)_\r\n\r\nDR MADDEN: Hypsospadia is also marked.

He is practically a total abstainer and I can\r\naffirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food,\r\ncold dried grocer’s peas. He wears a hairshirt of pure Irish\r\nmanufacture winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He\r\nwas, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree\r\nreformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child.\r\nI appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal\r\norgans have ever been called upon to speak.

The injection mark on the thigh I\r\nhope you perceived? Good.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Granpapachi. But...\r\n\r\nVIRAG: Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and\r\ncoiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of\r\ngopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I\r\nshould opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always\r\nunderstood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses\r\nof lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity.\r\nIn a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: She is rather lean.\r\n\r\nVIRAG: _(Not unpleasantly.)_ Absolutely! Well observed and those\r\npannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to\r\nsuggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for\r\nwhich a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye.\r\nObserve the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you\r\ntomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! _(With a nervous twitch of\r\nhis head.)_ Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: _(An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.)_\r\nShe seems sad.\r\n\r\nVIRAG: _(Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left\r\neye with a finger and barks hoarsely.)_ Hoax! Beware of the flapper and\r\nbogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor’s button\r\ndiscovered by Rualdus Columbus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon.\r\n_(More genially.)_ Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item\r\nnumber three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe\r\nthe mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she\r\nbumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: _(Regretfully.)_ When you come out without your gun.\r\n\r\nVIRAG: We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your\r\nmoney, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...\r\n\r\nBLOOM: With...?\r\n\r\nVIRAG: _(His tongue upcurling.)_ Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is\r\ncoated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in\r\nweight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two\r\nprotuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the\r\nnoonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional\r\nprotuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation,\r\nwhich leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts\r\nare the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers\r\nreach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and\r\ngumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during\r\ntheir brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal\r\nblubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker\r\nafter. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. _(His throat twitches.)_ Slapbang!\r\nThere he goes again.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: The stye I dislike.\r\n\r\nVIRAG: _(Arches his eyebrows.)_ Contact with a goldring, they say.\r\n_Argumentum ad feminam_, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in\r\nthe consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyosauros. For the rest Eve’s\r\nsovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. _(He twitches.)_\r\nIt is a funny sound. _(He coughs encouragingly.)_ But possibly it is\r\nonly a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have\r\ntaught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: _(Reflecting.)_ Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This\r\nsearching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of\r\naccidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said...\r\n\r\nVIRAG: _(Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.)_ Stop\r\ntwirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have\r\nforgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. _La causa è santa_. Tara. Tara.\r\n_(Aside.)_ He will surely remember.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Rosemary also did I understand you to say or willpower over\r\nparasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a\r\ndeadhand cures. Mnemo?\r\n\r\nVIRAG: _(Excitedly.)_ I say so. I say so. E’en so.

But, to change the venue\r\nto the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you\r\nlike or dislike women in male habiliments? _(With a dry snigger.)_ You\r\nintended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem\r\nand the summer months of 1886 to square the circle and win that\r\nmillion. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step.\r\nPyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gussetted knickers, closed? Or,\r\nput we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? _(He\r\ncrows derisively.)_ Keekeereekee!\r\n\r\n_(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores then gazes at the veiled\r\nmauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)_\r\n\r\nBLOOM: I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence\r\nthis. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is\r\nwill then morrow as now was be past yester.\r\n\r\nVIRAG: _(Prompts in a pig’s whisper.)_ Insects of the day spend their\r\nbrief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the\r\ninferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal nerve\r\nin dorsal region. Pretty Poll! _(His yellow parrotbeak gabbles\r\nnasally.)_ They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year\r\nfive thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of\r\nhoney will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first\r\nchoice malt vinegar. Bear’s buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At\r\nanother time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. _(He\r\ncoughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a\r\nscooping hand.)_ You shall find that these night insects follow the\r\nlight. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all\r\nthese knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of\r\nSexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L.

Bubbly jock! Where are\r\nwe? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! _(He unrolls his parchment rapidly and\r\nreads, his glowworm’s nose running backwards over the letters which he\r\nclaws.)_ Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer. Redbank oysters\r\nwill shortly be upon us. I’m the best o’cook. Those succulent bivalves\r\nmay help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through\r\nmister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility\r\nor viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. _(He wags his head with\r\ncackling raillery.)_ Jocular.

Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn\r\nat an address in D’Olier street while he presented himself indecently\r\nto the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he frankly\r\nencouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an\r\nunsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public\r\nconveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner\r\nto all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol\r\nworks did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to\r\nsee if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the\r\ngross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper\r\npresented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a\r\npostal order?\r\n\r\nBELLO: _(Whistles loudly.)_ Say!

Won’t that be\r\nnice? _(He places a ruby ring on her finger.)_ And there now! With this\r\nring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Thank you, mistress.\r\n\r\nBELLO: You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in\r\nthe different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh’s the cook’s, a sandy one.\r\nAy, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like\r\nchampagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! You will dance attendance or I’ll\r\nlecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right\r\nwell, miss, with the hairbrush. You’ll be taught the error of your\r\nways. At night your wellcreamed braceletted hands will wear\r\nfortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately\r\nscented fingertips.

First I’ll\r\nhave a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta\r\nMarsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the\r\nHanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work\r\nat a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers?\r\n_(He points.)_ For that lot. Trained by owner to fetch and carry,\r\nbasket in mouth. _(He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom’s\r\nvulva.)_ There’s fine depth for you! What, boys?

His\r\nsire’s milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks.\r\nWhoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! _(He brands his initial C on Bloom’s\r\ncroup.)_ So! Warranted Cohen!

The scanty, daringly short\r\nskirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a\r\npotent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long\r\nstraight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better\r\ninstincts of the _blasé_ man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk\r\non four inch Louis Quinze heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup,\r\nthe thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your powers of\r\nfascination to bear on them.

Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where’s\r\nyour curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing,\r\nbirdy, sing. It’s as limp as a boy of six’s doing his pooly behind a\r\ncart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. _(Loudly.)_ Can you do a man’s\r\njob?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Eccles street...\r\n\r\nBELLO: _(Sarcastically.)_ I wouldn’t hurt your feelings for the world\r\nbut there’s a man of brawn in possession there.

He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee\r\nto knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He’s no eunuch. A shock of red\r\nhair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine\r\nmonths, my lad! Holy ginger, it’s kicking and coughing up and down in\r\nher guts already! That makes you wild, don’t it?

You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me\r\nabove your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in\r\nfour places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my\r\nshame.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: _(Humbly kisses her long hair.)_ Your classic curves, beautiful\r\nimmortal, I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty,\r\nalmost to pray.\r\n\r\nTHE NYMPH: During dark nights I heard your praise.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: _(Quickly.)_ Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the\r\nworst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of\r\nbed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring.

From Gibraltar by long sea long ago.\r\n\r\nTHE NYMPH: _(Bends her head.)_ Worse, worse!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: _(Reflects precautiously.)_ That antiquated commode. It wasn’t\r\nher weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds\r\nafter weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh?

Thanks.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: _(Quietly.)_ You had better hand over that cash to me to take\r\ncare of. Why pay more?\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: _(Hands him all his coins.)_ Be just before you are generous.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: I will but is it wise? _(He counts.)_ One, seven, eleven, and\r\nfive. Six. Eleven. I don’t answer for what you may have lost.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next\r\nLessing says. Thirsty fox. _(He laughs loudly.)_ Burying his\r\ngrandmother. Probably he killed her.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: Doesn’t matter a rambling damn.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: No, but...\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: _(Comes to the table.)_ Cigarette, please. _(Lynch tosses a\r\ncigarette from the sofa to the table.)_ And so Georgina Johnson is dead\r\nand married. _(A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.)_\r\nWonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. _(He strikes a match and proceeds\r\nto light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)_\r\n\r\nLYNCH: _(Watching him.)_ You would have a better chance of lighting it\r\nif you held the match nearer.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: _(Brings the match near his eye.)_ Lynx eye. Must get glasses.\r\nBroke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all\r\nflat. _(He draws the match away. It goes out.)_ Brain thinks. Near:\r\nfar. Ineluctable modality of the visible. _(He frowns mysteriously.)_\r\nHm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight.

You\r\ndon’t want a scandal.\r\n\r\nBELLA: _(Angrily.)_ Trinity. Coming down here ragging after the\r\nboatraces and paying nothing. Are you my commander here or? Where is\r\nhe? I’ll charge him!

I need mountain air.\r\n\r\n_(He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows,\r\nspilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores\r\nclustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared\r\noff. From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front\r\nof the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is\r\nabout to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his\r\nface. Bella from within the hall urges on her whores. They blow\r\nickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghastly\r\nlewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty\r\nstill point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph’s hood\r\nand poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun\r\nal Raschid he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the\r\nrailings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn\r\nenvelopes drenched in aniseed.

If you give\r\nme a hand a second, sergeant...\r\n\r\nFIRST WATCH: Name and address.\r\n\r\n_(Corny Kelleher, weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand,\r\nappears among the bystanders.)_\r\n\r\nBLOOM: _(Quickly.)_ O, the very man! _(He whispers.)_ Simon Dedalus’\r\nson. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.\r\n\r\nSECOND WATCH: Night, Mr Kelleher.\r\n\r\nCORNY KELLEHER: _(To the watch, with drawling eye.)_ That’s all right.\r\nI know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. _(He laughs.)_\r\nTwenty to one. Do you follow me?\r\n\r\nFIRST WATCH: _(Turns to the crowd.)_ Here, what are you all gaping at?\r\nMove on out of that.\r\n\r\n_(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)_\r\n\r\nCORNY KELLEHER: Leave it to me, sergeant. That’ll be all right. _(He\r\nlaughs, shaking his head.)_ We were often as bad ourselves, ay or\r\nworse. What? Eh, what?\r\n\r\nFIRST WATCH: _(Laughs.)_ I suppose so.\r\n\r\nCORNY KELLEHER: _(Nudges the second watch.)_ Come and wipe your name\r\noff the slate. _(He lilts, wagging his head.)_ With my tooraloom\r\ntooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?\r\n\r\nSECOND WATCH: _(Genially.)_ Ah, sure we were too.\r\n\r\nCORNY KELLEHER: _(Winking.)_ Boys will be boys. I’ve a car round there.\r\n\r\nSECOND WATCH: All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.\r\n\r\nCORNY KELLEHER: I’ll see to that.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: _(Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.)_ Thank you very\r\nmuch, gentlemen. Thank you. _(He mumbles confidentially.)_ We don’t\r\nwant any scandal, you understand. Father is a wellknown highly\r\nrespected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.\r\n\r\nFIRST WATCH: O. I understand, sir.\r\n\r\nSECOND WATCH: That’s all right, sir.\r\n\r\nFIRST WATCH: It was only in case of corporal injuries I’d have to\r\nreport it at the station.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: _(Nods rapidly.)_ Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nSECOND WATCH: It’s our duty.\r\n\r\nCORNY KELLEHER: Good night, men.\r\n\r\nTHE WATCH: _(Saluting together.)_ Night, gentlemen. _(They move off\r\nwith slow heavy tread.)_\r\n\r\nBLOOM: _(Blows.)_ Providential you came on the scene. You have a\r\ncar?...\r\n\r\nCORNY KELLEHER: _(Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to\r\nthe car brought up against the scaffolding.)_ Two commercials that were\r\nstanding fizz in Jammet’s. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two\r\nquid on the race. Drowning his grief. And were on for a go with the\r\njolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan’s car and down to nighttown.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...\r\n\r\nCORNY KELLEHER: _(Laughs.)_ Sure they wanted me to join in with the\r\nmots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself.\r\n_(He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.)_ Thanks be to God we\r\nhave it in the house, what, eh, do you follow me? Hah, hah, hah!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: _(Tries to laugh.)_ He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just\r\nvisiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don’t know him (poor\r\nfellow, he’s laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together\r\nand I was just making my way home...\r\n\r\n_(The horse neighs.)_\r\n\r\nTHE HORSE: Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!\r\n\r\nCORNY KELLEHER: Sure it was Behan our jarvey there that told me after\r\nwe left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen’s and I told him to pull up\r\nand got off to see. _(He laughs.)_ Sober hearsedrivers a speciality.\r\nWill I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in\r\nCabra, what?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.\r\n\r\n_(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher, asquint,\r\ndrawls at the horse. Bloom, in gloom, looms down.)_\r\n\r\nCORNY KELLEHER: _(Scratches his nape.)_ Sandycove! _(He bends down and\r\ncalls to Stephen.)_ Eh! _(He calls again.)_ Eh! He’s covered with\r\nshavings anyhow. Take care they didn’t lift anything off him.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.\r\n\r\nCORNY KELLEHER: Ah, well, he’ll get over it. No bones broken. Well,\r\nI’ll shove along. _(He laughs.)_ I’ve a rendezvous in the morning.\r\nBurying the dead. Safe home!\r\n\r\nTHE HORSE: _(Neighs.)_ Hohohohohome.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Good night. I’ll just wait and take him along in a few...\r\n\r\n_(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse\r\nharness jingles.)_\r\n\r\nCORNY KELLEHER: _(From the car, standing.)_ Night.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Night.\r\n\r\n_(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The\r\ncar and horse back slowly, awkwardly, and turn. Corny Kelleher on the\r\nsideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Bloom’s plight.\r\nThe jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the\r\nfarther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb\r\nand palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the\r\nsleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom\r\nconveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car\r\njingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny\r\nKelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand\r\nassuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling\r\nhoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloo looloo\r\nlay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephen’s hat, festooned with shavings,\r\nand ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by\r\nthe shoulder.)_\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Eh! Ho! _(There is no answer; he bends again.)_ Mr Dedalus!\r\n_(There is no answer.)_ The name if you call. Somnambulist. _(He bends\r\nagain and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate\r\nform.)_ Stephen! _(There is no answer. He calls again.)_ Stephen!\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: _(Groans.)_ Who? Black panther. Vampire. _(He sighs and\r\nstretches himself, then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.)_\r\n\r\n Who... drive... Fergus now\r\n And pierce... wood’s woven shade?...\r\n\r\n_(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)_\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Poetry. Well educated. Pity. _(He bends again and undoes the\r\nbuttons of Stephen’s waistcoat.)_ To breathe. _(He brushes the\r\nwoodshavings from Stephen’s clothes with light hand and fingers.)_ One\r\npound seven. Not hurt anyhow. _(He listens.)_ What?\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: _(Murmurs.)_\r\n\r\n ... shadows... the woods\r\n ... white breast... dim sea.\r\n\r\n_(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom,\r\nholding the hat and ashplant, stands erect. A dog barks in the\r\ndistance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks\r\ndown on Stephen’s face and form.)_\r\n\r\nBLOOM: _(Communes with the night.)_ Face reminds me of his poor mother.\r\nIn the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A\r\ngirl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him. _(He murmurs.)_... swear\r\nthat I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts,\r\nart or arts... _(He murmurs.)_... in the rough sands of the sea... a\r\ncabletow’s length from the shore... where the tide ebbs... and flows\r\n...\r\n\r\n_(Silent, thoughtful, alert he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips\r\nin the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure\r\nappears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed\r\nin an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a\r\nbook in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling,\r\nkissing the page.)_\r\n\r\nBLOOM: _(Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.)_ Rudy!\r\n\r\nRUDY: _(Gazes, unseeing, into Bloom’s eyes and goes on reading,\r\nkissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauve face. On his suit he has\r\ndiamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory\r\ncane with a violet bowknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat\r\npocket.)_\r\n\n— III —\r\n\n[ 16 ]\r\n\r\nPreparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of\r\nthe shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up\r\ngenerally in orthodox Samaritan fashion which he very badly needed. His\r\n(Stephen’s) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a\r\nbit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr\r\nBloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry\r\nwater available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit\r\nupon an expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the\r\ncabman’s shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt\r\nbridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk\r\nand soda or a mineral. But how to get there was the rub. For the nonce\r\nhe was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon\r\nhim to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and\r\nmeans during which Stephen repeatedly yawned. So far as he could see he\r\nwas rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly\r\nadvisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in\r\ntheir then condition, both of them being e.d.ed, particularly Stephen,\r\nalways assuming that there was such a thing to be found. Accordingly\r\nafter a few such preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having\r\nforgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had\r\ndone yeoman service in the shaving line, they both walked together\r\nalong Beaver street or, more properly, lane as far as the farrier’s and\r\nthe distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of\r\nMontgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence\r\ndebouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergin’s. But\r\nas he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for\r\nhire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some\r\nfellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star hotel and there was\r\nno symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was\r\nanything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by\r\nemitting a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head,\r\ntwice.\r\n\r\nThis was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently\r\nthere was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it\r\nwhich they accordingly did. So, bevelling around by Mullett’s and the\r\nSignal House which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the\r\ndirection of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped\r\nby the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had,\r\nto vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though,\r\nentering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made\r\nlight of the mischance. So as neither of them were particularly pressed\r\nfor time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it\r\ncleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they\r\ndandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a\r\nfare or a jarvey. As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company’s\r\nsandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his\r\ncompanion _à propos_ of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of\r\nsome little while back. They passed the main entrance of the Great\r\nNorthern railway station, the starting point for Belfast, where of\r\ncourse all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the\r\nbackdoor of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not to say\r\ngruesome to a degree, more especially at night) ultimately gained the\r\nDock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street, famous for its\r\nC division police station. Between this point and the high at present\r\nunlit warehouses of Beresford place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen,\r\nassociated with Baird’s the stonecutter’s in his mind somehow in Talbot\r\nplace, first turning on the right, while the other who was acting as\r\nhis _fidus Achates_ inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of\r\nJames Rourke’s city bakery, situated quite close to where they were,\r\nthe very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread, of all commodities\r\nof the public the primary and most indispensable. Bread, the staff of\r\nlife, earn your bread, O tell me where is fancy bread, at Rourke’s the\r\nbaker’s it is said.\r\n\r\n_En route_ to his taciturn and, not to put too fine a point on it, not\r\nyet perfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in\r\ncomplete possession of his faculties, never more so, in fact\r\ndisgustingly sober, spoke a word of caution _re_ the dangers of\r\nnighttown, women of ill fame and swell mobsmen, which, barely\r\npermissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice, was of\r\nthe nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age\r\nparticularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence\r\nof liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as\r\neven a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if\r\nyou didn’t look out. Highly providential was the appearance on the\r\nscene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious but for\r\nthat man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might\r\nhave been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or,\r\nfailing that, the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day\r\nbefore Mr Tobias or, he being the solicitor rather, old Wall, he meant\r\nto say, or Mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got\r\nbruited about. The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those\r\npolicemen, whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in\r\nthe service of the Crown and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or\r\ntwo in the A division in Clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole\r\nthrough a ten gallon pot. Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet\r\nparts of the city, Pembroke road for example, the guardians of the law\r\nwere well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were paid to\r\nprotect the upper classes. Another thing he commented on was equipping\r\nsoldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off\r\nat any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians\r\nshould by any chance they fall out over anything. You frittered away\r\nyour time, he very sensibly maintained, and health and also character\r\nbesides which, the squandermania of the thing, fast women of the\r\n_demimonde_ ran away with a lot of £. s. d. into the bargain and the\r\ngreatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching the\r\nmuch vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old\r\nwine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing\r\naperient virtues (notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch\r\nbeliever in) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably\r\ndrew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of\r\nyour being at the tender mercy of others practically. Most of all he\r\ncommented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting\r\n_confrères_ but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his\r\nbrother medicos under all the circs.\r\n\r\n—And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothing\r\nwhatsoever of any kind.\r\n\r\nDiscussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back\r\nof the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a\r\nbrazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one\r\nattracted their rather lagging footsteps. Stephen of his own accord\r\nstopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren\r\ncobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just\r\nmake out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom\r\nof the sentrybox. He began to remember that this had happened or had\r\nbeen mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small\r\neffort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a\r\n_quondam_ friend of his father’s, Gumley. To avoid a meeting he drew\r\nnearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.\r\n\r\n—Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\nA figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches\r\nsaluted again, calling:\r\n\r\n—Night!\r\n\r\nStephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the\r\ncompliment. Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch\r\nas he always believed in minding his own business moved off but\r\nnevertheless remained on the _qui vive_ with just a shade of anxiety\r\nthough not funkyish in the least. Though unusual in the Dublin area he\r\nknew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next\r\nto nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising\r\npeaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some\r\nsecluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the Thames\r\nembankment category they might be hanging about there or simply\r\nmarauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell\r\nswoop at a moment’s notice, your money or your life, leaving you there\r\nto point a moral, gagged and garrotted.\r\n\r\nStephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters,\r\nthough he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley’s\r\nbreath redolent of rotten cornjuice. Lord John Corley some called him\r\nand his genealogy came about in this wise. He was the eldest son of\r\ninspector Corley of the G division, lately deceased, who had married a\r\ncertain Katherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer. His\r\ngrandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of\r\na publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot.\r\nRumour had it (though not proved) that she descended from the house of\r\nthe lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably\r\nfine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or\r\nsome relative, a woman, as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had\r\nenjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen. This\r\ntherefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though\r\ndissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with\r\nfacetious proclivities as Lord John Corley.\r\n\r\nTaking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell.\r\nNot as much as a farthing to purchase a night’s lodgings. His friends\r\nhad all deserted him. Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called\r\nhim to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of\r\nother uncalledfor expressions. He was out of a job and implored of\r\nStephen to tell him where on God’s earth he could get something,\r\nanything at all, to do. No, it was the daughter of the mother in the\r\nwashkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they\r\nwere connected through the mother in some way, both occurrences\r\nhappening at the same time if the whole thing wasn’t a complete\r\nfabrication from start to finish. Anyhow he was all in.\r\n\r\n—I wouldn’t ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows\r\nI’m on the rocks.\r\n\r\n—There’ll be a job tomorrow or next day, Stephen told him, in a boys’\r\nschool at Dalkey for a gentleman usher. Mr Garrett Deasy. Try it. You\r\nmay mention my name.\r\n\r\n—Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn’t teach in a school, man. I was\r\nnever one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh. I got stuck\r\ntwice in the junior at the christian brothers.\r\n\r\n—I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.\r\n\r\nCorley at the first go-off was inclined to suspect it was something to\r\ndo with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody\r\ntart off the street. There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs\r\nMaloney’s, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but\r\nM’Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over\r\nin Winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person\r\naddressed of friar Bacon) for a bob. He was starving too though he\r\nhadn’t said a word about it.\r\n\r\nThough this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it\r\nstill Stephen’s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he\r\nknew that Corley’s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was\r\nhardly deserving of much credence. However _haud ignarus malorum\r\nmiseris succurrere disco etcetera_ as the Latin poet remarks especially\r\nas luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the\r\nmonth on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of\r\nfact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished. But the cream\r\nof the joke was nothing would get it out of Corley’s head that he was\r\nliving in affluence and hadn’t a thing to do but hand out the needful.\r\nWhereas. He put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of\r\nfinding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a\r\nbob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get\r\nsufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for, to his\r\nchagrin, he found his cash missing. A few broken biscuits were all the\r\nresult of his investigation. He tried his hardest to recollect for the\r\nmoment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in\r\nthat contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse\r\nin fact. He was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough\r\nsearch though he tried to recollect. About biscuits he dimly\r\nremembered. Who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did\r\nhe buy. However in another pocket he came across what he surmised in\r\nthe dark were pennies, erroneously however, as it turned out.\r\n\r\n—Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.\r\n\r\nAnd so in point of fact they turned out to be. Stephen anyhow lent him\r\none of them.\r\n\r\n—Thanks, Corley answered, you’re a gentleman. I’ll pay you back one\r\ntime. Who’s that with you? I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse\r\nin Camden street with Boylan, the billsticker. You might put in a good\r\nword for us to get me taken on there. I’d carry a sandwichboard only\r\nthe girl in the office told me they’re full up for the next three\r\nweeks, man. God, you’ve to book ahead, man, you’d think it was for the\r\nCarl Rosa. I don’t give a shite anyway so long as I get a job, even as\r\na crossing sweeper.\r\n\r\nSubsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six\r\nhe got he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky\r\nthat he said Stephen knew well out of Fullam’s, the shipchandler’s,\r\nbookkeeper there that used to be often round in Nagle’s back with\r\nO’Mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe. Anyhow he\r\nwas lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and\r\ndisorderly and refusing to go with the constable.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the\r\ncobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation\r\nwatchman’s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work, it struck him,\r\nwas having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own\r\nprivate account while Dublin slept. He threw an odd eye at the same\r\ntime now and then at Stephen’s anything but immaculately attired\r\ninterlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though\r\nwhere he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the\r\nremotest idea when. Being a levelheaded individual who could give\r\npoints to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on\r\nhis very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally\r\ntestifying to a chronic impecuniosity. Palpably he was one of his\r\nhangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one\r\npreying on his nextdoor neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put\r\nit, a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street\r\nchanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the\r\noption of a fine would be a very _rara avis_ altogether. In any case he\r\nhad a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that\r\nhour of the night or morning. Pretty thick that was certainly.\r\n\r\nThe pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who, with his\r\npractised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the\r\nblandiloquence of the other parasite. Alluding to the encounter he\r\nsaid, laughingly, Stephen, that is:\r\n\r\n—He is down on his luck. He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named\r\nBoylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.\r\n\r\nAt this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr\r\nBloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the\r\ndirection of a bucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana,\r\nmoored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair,\r\nwhereupon he observed evasively:\r\n\r\n—Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say. Now you mention it\r\nhis face was familiar to me. But, leaving that for the moment, how much\r\ndid you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?\r\n\r\n—Half a crown, Stephen responded. I daresay he needs it to sleep\r\nsomewhere.\r\n\r\n—Needs! Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the\r\nintelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he\r\ninvariably does. Everyone according to his needs or everyone according\r\nto his deeds. But, talking about things in general, where, added he\r\nwith a smile, will you sleep yourself? Walking to Sandycove is out of\r\nthe question. And even supposing you did you won’t get in after what\r\noccurred at Westland Row station. Simply fag out there for nothing. I\r\ndon’t mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why\r\ndid you leave your father’s house?\r\n\r\n—To seek misfortune, was Stephen’s answer.\r\n\r\n—I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom\r\ndiplomatically returned, today in fact, or to be strictly accurate, on\r\nyesterday. Where does he live at present? I gathered in the course of\r\nconversation that he had moved.\r\n\r\n—I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly.\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\n—A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects\r\nthan one and a born _raconteur_ if ever there was one. He takes great\r\npride, quite legitimate, out of you. You could go back perhaps, he\r\nhasarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row\r\nterminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan,\r\nthat is, and that English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred\r\ntheir third companion, were patently trying as if the whole bally\r\nstation belonged to them to give Stephen the slip in the confusion,\r\nwhich they did.\r\n\r\nThere was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, such as it\r\nwas, Stephen’s mind’s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his\r\nfamily hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by\r\nthe ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell\r\ncocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he\r\ncould drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings\r\nthey had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and\r\nKatey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells\r\nand charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper, in\r\naccordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on\r\nthe days commanded, it being quarter tense or if not, ember days or\r\nsomething like that.\r\n\r\n—No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn’t personally repose much trust\r\nin that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element,\r\nDr Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher and friend if I were in your\r\nshoes. He knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all\r\nprobability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals.\r\nOf course you didn’t notice as much as I did. But it wouldn’t occasion\r\nme the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic\r\nwas put in your drink for some ulterior object.\r\n\r\nHe understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a\r\nversatile allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was\r\nrapidly coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified,\r\nbade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future\r\nas a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services\r\nin addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from\r\ncertain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid\r\nat Skerries, or Malahide was it?, was, he was bound to admit, an\r\nexceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that\r\nfrankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be\r\nat the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or\r\njealousy, pure and simple.\r\n\r\n—Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking\r\nyour brains, he ventured to throw out.\r\n\r\nThe guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by\r\nfriendliness which he gave at Stephen’s at present morose expression of\r\nfeatures did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the\r\nproblem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge\r\nby two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about\r\nsaw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to\r\nhimself allowed matters to more or less. Grinding poverty did have that\r\neffect and he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities\r\nthough he possessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both\r\nends meet.\r\n\r\nAdjacent to the men’s public urinal they perceived an icecream car\r\nround which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were\r\ngetting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a\r\nparticularly animated way, there being some little differences between\r\nthe parties.\r\n\r\n—_Puttana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! Ho ragione? Culo rotto!_\r\n\r\n_—Intendiamoci. Mezzo sovrano più..._\r\n\r\n_—Dice lui, però!_\r\n\r\n_—Mezzo._\r\n\r\n_—Farabutto! Mortacci sui!_\r\n\r\n_—Ma ascolta! Cinque la testa più..._\r\n\r\nMr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman’s shelter, an unpretentious\r\nwooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely if ever been\r\nbefore, the former having previously whispered to the latter a few\r\nhints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat\r\nFitzharris, the invincible, though he could not vouch for the actual\r\nfacts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in. A few\r\nmoments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet\r\ncorner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous\r\ncollection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the\r\ngenus _homo_ already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified\r\nby conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\n—Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest\r\nto break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the\r\nshape of solid food, say, a roll of some description.\r\n\r\nAccordingly his first act was with characteristic _sangfroid_ to order\r\nthese commodities quietly. The _hoi polloi_ of jarvies or stevedores or\r\nwhatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes\r\napparently dissatisfied, away though one redbearded bibulous\r\nindividual, portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor probably, still\r\nstared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention\r\nto the floor. Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech,\r\nhe having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute,\r\nthough, to be sure, rather in a quandary over _voglio_, remarked to his\r\n_protégé_ in an audible tone of voice _à propos_ of the battle royal in\r\nthe street which was still raging fast and furious:\r\n\r\n—A beautiful language. I mean for singing purposes. Why do you not\r\nwrite your poetry in that language? _Bella Poetria_! It is so melodious\r\nand full. _Belladonna. Voglio._\r\n\r\nStephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could, suffering\r\nfrom lassitude generally, replied:\r\n\r\n—To fill the ear of a cow elephant. They were haggling over money.\r\n\r\n—Is that so? Mr Bloom asked. Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the\r\ninward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were\r\nabsolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that\r\nsurrounds it.\r\n\r\nThe keeper of the shelter in the middle of this _tête-à-tête_ put a\r\nboiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the\r\ntable and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed.\r\nAfter which he beat a retreat to his counter, Mr Bloom determining to\r\nhave a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to. For\r\nwhich reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he\r\ndid the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was\r\ntemporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him.\r\n\r\n—Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time,\r\nlike names. Cicero, Podmore, Napoleon, Mr Goodbody. Jesus, Mr Doyle.\r\nShakespeares were as common as Murphies. What’s in a name?\r\n\r\n—Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred. Of course. Our name\r\nwas changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.\r\n\r\nThe redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded\r\nStephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely\r\nby asking:\r\n\r\n—And what might your name be?\r\n\r\nJust in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion’s boot but\r\nStephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected\r\nquarter, answered:\r\n\r\n—Dedalus.\r\n\r\nThe sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes,\r\nrather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old\r\nHollands and water.\r\n\r\n—You know Simon Dedalus? he asked at length.\r\n\r\n—I’ve heard of him, Stephen said.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently\r\neavesdropping too.\r\n\r\n—He’s Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same\r\nway and nodding. All Irish.\r\n\r\n—All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.\r\n\r\nAs for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole\r\nbusiness and he was just asking himself what possible connection when\r\nthe sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the\r\nshelter with the remark:\r\n\r\n—I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his\r\nshoulder. The lefthand dead shot.\r\n\r\nThough he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his\r\ngestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.\r\n\r\n—Bottles out there, say. Fifty yards measured. Eggs on the bottles.\r\nCocks his gun over his shoulder. Aims.\r\n\r\nHe turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely. Then\r\nhe screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the\r\nnight with an unprepossessing cast of countenance.\r\n\r\n—Pom! he then shouted once.\r\n\r\nThe entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation,\r\nthere being still a further egg.\r\n\r\n—Pom! he shouted twice.\r\n\r\nEgg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding\r\nbloodthirstily:\r\n\r\n_—Buffalo Bill shoots to kill,\r\n\r\nNever missed nor he never will._\r\n\r\nA silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness’ sake just felt like\r\nasking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the\r\nBisley.\r\n\r\n—Beg pardon, the sailor said.\r\n\r\n—Long ago? Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.\r\n\r\n—Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic\r\ninfluence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years. He\r\ntoured the wide world with Hengler’s Royal Circus. I seen him do that\r\nin Stockholm.\r\n\r\n—Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.\r\n\r\n—Murphy’s my name, the sailor continued. D. B. Murphy of Carrigaloe.\r\nKnow where that is?\r\n\r\n—Queenstown harbour, Stephen replied.\r\n\r\n—That’s right, the sailor said. Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle. That’s\r\nwhere I hails from. I belongs there. That’s where I hails from. My\r\nlittle woman’s down there. She’s waiting for me, I know. _For England,\r\nhome and beauty_. She’s my own true wife I haven’t seen for seven years\r\nnow, sailing about.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, the homecoming\r\nto the mariner’s roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones, a\r\nrainy night with a blind moon. Across the world for a wife. Quite a\r\nnumber of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic,\r\nEnoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember\r\nCaoc O’Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way\r\nof poor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way.\r\nNever about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the\r\nabsentee. The face at the window! Judge of his astonishment when he\r\nfinally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent\r\nhis better half, wrecked in his affections. You little expected me but\r\nI’ve come to stay and make a fresh start. There she sits, a grasswidow,\r\nat the selfsame fireside. Believes me dead, rocked in the cradle of the\r\ndeep. And there sits uncle Chubb or Tomkin, as the case might be, the\r\npublican of the Crown and Anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and\r\nonions. No chair for father. Broo! The wind! Her brandnew arrival is on\r\nher knee, _post mortem_ child. With a high ro! and a randy ro! and my\r\ngalloping tearing tandy, O! Bow to the inevitable. Grin and bear it. I\r\nremain with much love your brokenhearted husband W. B. Murphy.\r\n\r\nThe sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one\r\nof the jarvies with the request:\r\n\r\n—You don’t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you?\r\n\r\nThe jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die\r\nof plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object\r\nwas passed from hand to hand.\r\n\r\n—Thank you, the sailor said.\r\n\r\nHe deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slow\r\nstammers, proceeded:\r\n\r\n—We come up this morning eleven o’clock. The threemaster _Rosevean_\r\nfrom Bridgwater with bricks. I shipped to get over. Paid off this\r\nafternoon. There’s my discharge. See? D. B. Murphy. A. B. S.\r\n\r\nIn confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket\r\nand handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document.\r\n\r\n—You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked,\r\nleaning on the counter.\r\n\r\n—Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it, I’ve circumnavigated\r\na bit since I first joined on. I was in the Red Sea. I was in China and\r\nNorth America and South America. We was chased by pirates one voyage. I\r\nseen icebergs plenty, growlers. I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea,\r\nthe Dardanelles under Captain Dalton, the best bloody man that ever\r\nscuttled a ship. I seen Russia. _Gospodi pomilyou_. That’s how the\r\nRussians prays.\r\n\r\n—You seen queer sights, don’t be talking, put in a jarvey.\r\n\r\n—Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug. I seen queer\r\nthings too, ups and downs. I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an\r\nanchor same as I chew that quid.\r\n\r\nHe took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his\r\nteeth, bit ferociously:\r\n\r\n—Khaan! Like that. And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and\r\nthe livers of horses. Look here. Here they are. A friend of mine sent\r\nme.\r\n\r\nHe fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed\r\nto be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table.\r\nThe printed matter on it stated: _Choza de Indios. Beni, Bolivia._\r\n\r\nAll focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savage\r\nwomen in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning,\r\nsleeping amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of\r\nthem) outside some primitive shanties of osier.\r\n\r\n—Chews coca all day, the communicative tarpaulin added. Stomachs like\r\nbreadgraters. Cuts off their diddies when they can’t bear no more\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nSee them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse’s liver\r\nraw.\r\n\r\nHis postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns\r\nfor several minutes if not more.\r\n\r\n—Know how to keep them off? he inquired generally.\r\n\r\nNobody volunteering a statement he winked, saying:\r\n\r\n—Glass. That boggles ’em. Glass.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the\r\ncard to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark. It ran\r\nas follows: _Tarjeta Postal, Señor A Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago,\r\nChile._ There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice.\r\nThough not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the\r\neggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the\r\nLazarillo-Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in _Maritana_ on which\r\noccasion the former’s ball passed through the latter’s hat) having\r\ndetected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he\r\nrepresented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after\r\nhaving boxed the compass on the strict q.t. somewhere) and the\r\nfictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some\r\nsuspicions of our friend’s _bona fides_ nevertheless it reminded him in\r\na way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some\r\nWednesday or Saturday of travelling to London _via_ long sea not to say\r\nthat he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was\r\nat heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had\r\nconsistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead\r\nwhich was his longest. Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work\r\na pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up\r\nwith the net result that the scheme fell through. But even suppose it\r\ndid come to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd’s heart it was\r\nnot so dear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside considering\r\nthe fare to Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six, there\r\nand back. The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone\r\nand be in every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose\r\nliver was out of order, seeing the different places along the route,\r\nPlymouth, Falmouth, Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive\r\ntour of the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern\r\nBabylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement, tower,\r\nabbey, wealth of Park lane to renew acquaintance with. Another thing\r\njust struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze\r\naround on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a\r\nconcert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure\r\nresorts, Margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas,\r\nEastbourne, Scarborough, Margate and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the\r\nChannel islands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly\r\nremunerative. Not, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or\r\nlocal ladies on the job, witness Mrs C P M’Coy type lend me your valise\r\nand I’ll post you the ticket. No, something top notch, an all star\r\nIrish caste, the Tweedy-Flower grand opera company with his own legal\r\nconsort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes\r\nand Moody-Manners, perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of\r\nsuccess, providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some\r\nfellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and\r\nthus combine business with pleasure. But who? That was the rub.\r\n\r\nAlso, without being actually positive, it struck him a great field was\r\nto be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with\r\nthe times _apropos_ of the Fishguard-Rosslare route which, it was\r\nmooted, was once more on the _tapis_ in the circumlocution departments\r\nwith the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete\r\nfogeydom and dunderheads generally. A great opportunity there certainly\r\nwas for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public\r\nat large, the average man, i.e. Brown, Robinson and Co.\r\n\r\nIt was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no\r\nsmall blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when the\r\nsystem really needed toning up, for the matter of a couple of paltry\r\npounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead\r\nof being always and ever cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took\r\nme for a wife. After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more\r\nhumdrum months of it and merited a radical change of _venue_ after the\r\ngrind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame Nature is at\r\nher spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life.\r\nThere were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home\r\nisland, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora\r\nof attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around\r\nDublin and its picturesque environs even, Poulaphouca to which there\r\nwas a steamtram, but also farther away from the madding crowd in\r\nWicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood\r\nfor elderly wheelmen so long as it didn’t come down, and in the wilds\r\nof Donegal where if report spoke true the _coup d’œil_ was exceedingly\r\ngrand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that\r\nthe influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering\r\nthe signal benefits to be derived from it while Howth with its historic\r\nassociations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O’Malley, George IV,\r\nrhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt\r\nwith all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when\r\nyoung men’s fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off\r\nthe cliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their\r\nleft leg, it being only about three quarters of an hour’s run from the\r\npillar. Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely\r\nin its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be\r\ndesired. Interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of\r\ncuriosity, pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created\r\nthe route or viceversa or the two sides in fact. He turned back the\r\nother side of the card, picture, and passed it along to Stephen.\r\n\r\n—I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had\r\nlittle pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened\r\nand every pill was something different. One was a ship, another was a\r\nhouse, another was a flower. Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly\r\nadded, the chinks does.\r\n\r\nPossibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the\r\nglobetrotter went on, adhering to his adventures.\r\n\r\n—And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap. Knife in his\r\nback. Knife like that.\r\n\r\nWhilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in\r\nkeeping with his character and held it in the striking position.\r\n\r\n—In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers.\r\nFellow hid behind a door, come up behind him. Like that. _Prepare to\r\nmeet your God_, says he. Chuk! It went into his back up to the butt.\r\n\r\nHis heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further\r\nquestions even should they by any chance want to.\r\n\r\n—That’s a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable\r\n_stiletto_.\r\n\r\nAfter which harrowing _dénouement_ sufficient to appal the stoutest he\r\nsnapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before\r\nin his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.\r\n\r\n—They’re great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in\r\nthe dark said for the benefit of them all. That was why they thought\r\nthe park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account\r\nof them using knives.\r\n\r\nAt this remark passed obviously in the spirit of _where ignorance is\r\nbliss_ Mr B. and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both\r\ninstinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the\r\nstrictly _entre nous_ variety however, towards where Skin-the-Goat,\r\n_alias_ the keeper, not turning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid\r\nfrom his boiler affair. His inscrutable face which was really a work of\r\nart, a perfect study in itself, beggaring description, conveyed the\r\nimpression that he didn’t understand one jot of what was going on.\r\nFunny, very!\r\n\r\nThere ensued a somewhat lengthy pause. One man was reading in fits and\r\nstarts a stained by coffee evening journal, another the card with the\r\nnatives _choza de_, another the seaman’s discharge. Mr Bloom, so far as\r\nhe was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood. He\r\nvividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well\r\nas yesterday, roughly some score of years previously in the days of the\r\nland troubles, when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively\r\nspeaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was\r\njust turned fifteen.\r\n\r\n—Ay, boss, the sailor broke in. Give us back them papers.\r\n\r\nThe request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape.\r\n\r\n—Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar? Mr Bloom inquired.\r\n\r\nThe sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay or\r\nno.\r\n\r\n—Ah, you’ve touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he\r\nhad, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences\r\nbut he failed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the\r\nsawdust, and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.\r\n\r\n—What year would that be about? Mr B interrogated. Can you recall the\r\nboats?\r\n\r\nOur _soi-disant_ sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before\r\nanswering:\r\n\r\n—I’m tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships.\r\nSalt junk all the time.\r\n\r\nTired seemingly, he ceased. His questioner perceiving that he was not\r\nlikely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer,\r\nfell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the\r\nglobe, suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed,\r\nit covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly\r\nwhat it meant to rule the waves. On more than one occasion, a dozen at\r\nthe lowest, near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a\r\nsuperannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the\r\nnot particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at\r\nit and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone\r\nsomewhere sings. And it left him wondering why. Possibly he had tried\r\nto find out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the\r\nantipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under, well, not\r\nexactly under, tempting the fates. And the odds were twenty to nil\r\nthere was really no secret about it at all. Nevertheless, without going\r\ninto the _minutiae_ of the business, the eloquent fact remained that\r\nthe sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things\r\nsomebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence\r\nthough it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that\r\nsort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery\r\nand insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for\r\nthat very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was a highly laudable\r\ninstitution to which the public at large, no matter where living inland\r\nor seaside, as the case might be, having it brought home to them like\r\nthat should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and\r\ncoastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid\r\nthe elements whatever the season when duty called _Ireland expects that\r\nevery man_ and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the\r\nwintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to\r\ncapsize at any moment, rounding which he once with his daughter had\r\nexperienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather.\r\n\r\n—There was a fellow sailed with me in the _Rover_, the old seadog,\r\nhimself a rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as\r\ngentleman’s valet at six quid a month. Them are his trousers I’ve on me\r\nand he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife. I’m game for that job,\r\nshaving and brushup. I hate roaming about. There’s my son now, Danny,\r\nrun off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper’s in Cork where\r\nhe could be drawing easy money.\r\n\r\n—What age is he? queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the\r\nside, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away\r\nfrom the carking cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy\r\ngetup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.\r\n\r\n—Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my son, Danny?\r\nHe’d be about eighteen now, way I figure it.\r\n\r\nThe Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow\r\nshirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was\r\nto be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent\r\nan anchor.\r\n\r\n—There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts.\r\nI must get a wash tomorrow or next day. It’s them black lads I objects\r\nto. I hate those buggers. Suck your blood dry, they does.\r\n\r\nSeeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged\r\nhis shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the\r\nmariner’s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure 16 and a\r\nyoung man’s sideface looking frowningly rather.\r\n\r\n—Tattoo, the exhibitor explained. That was done when we were lying\r\nbecalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton. Fellow, the\r\nname of Antonio, done that. There he is himself, a Greek.\r\n\r\n—Did it hurt much doing it? one asked the sailor.\r\n\r\nThat worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the.\r\nSomeway in his. Squeezing or.\r\n\r\n—See here, he said, showing Antonio. There he is cursing the mate. And\r\nthere he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with his\r\nfingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.\r\n\r\nAnd in point of fact the young man named Antonio’s livid face did\r\nactually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the\r\nunreserved admiration of everybody including Skin-the-Goat, who this\r\ntime stretched over.\r\n\r\n—Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest. He’s gone\r\ntoo. Ate by sharks after. Ay, ay.\r\n\r\nHe let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression\r\nof before.\r\n\r\n—Neat bit of work, one longshoreman said.\r\n\r\n—And what’s the number for? loafer number two queried.\r\n\r\n—Eaten alive? a third asked the sailor.\r\n\r\n—Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time\r\nwith some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the\r\ndirection of the questioner about the number. Ate. A Greek he was.\r\n\r\nAnd then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his\r\nalleged end:\r\n\r\n —As bad as old Antonio,\r\n For he left me on my ownio.\r\n\r\nThe face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat\r\npeered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on\r\nher own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill. Mr Bloom,\r\nscarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment\r\nflusterfied but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink\r\nsheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had\r\nlaid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though\r\nwhy pink. His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round\r\nthe door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that\r\nafternoon on Ormond quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the\r\nlane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.)\r\nand begged the chance of his washing. Also why washing which seemed\r\nrather vague than not, your washing. Still candour compelled him to\r\nadmit he had washed his wife’s undergarments when soiled in Holles\r\nstreet and women would and did too a man’s similar garments initialled\r\nwith Bewley and Draper’s marking ink (hers were, that is) if they\r\nreally loved him, that is to say, love me, love my dirty shirt. Still\r\njust then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female’s room more than\r\nher company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a\r\nrude sign to take herself off. Round the side of the _Evening\r\nTelegraph_ he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side\r\nof the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was\r\nnot exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of\r\ngazers round skipper Murphy’s nautical chest and then there was no more\r\nof her.\r\n\r\n—The gunboat, the keeper said.\r\n\r\n—It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking,\r\nhow a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with\r\ndisease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober\r\nsenses, if he values his health in the least. Unfortunate creature! Of\r\ncourse I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition.\r\nStill no matter what the cause is from...\r\n\r\nStephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely\r\nremarking:\r\n\r\n—In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a\r\nroaring trade. Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to\r\nbuy the soul. She is a bad merchant. She buys dear and sells cheap.\r\n\r\nThe elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a\r\nprude, said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be\r\nput a stop to _instanter_ to say that women of that stamp (quite apart\r\nfrom any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil,\r\nwere not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a\r\nthing, he could truthfully state, he, as a _paterfamilias_, was a\r\nstalwart advocate of from the very first start. Whoever embarked on a\r\npolicy of the sort, he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would\r\nconfer a lasting boon on everybody concerned.\r\n\r\n—You as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe\r\nin the soul. Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such,\r\nas distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup. I\r\nbelieve in that myself because it has been explained by competent men\r\nas the convolutions of the grey matter. Otherwise we would never have\r\nsuch inventions as X rays, for instance. Do you?\r\n\r\nThus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try\r\nand concentrate and remember before he could say:\r\n\r\n—They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and\r\ntherefore incorruptible. It would be immortal, I understand, but for\r\nthe possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who, from all I\r\ncan hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other\r\npractical jokes, _corruptio per se_ and _corruptio per accidens_ both\r\nbeing excluded by court etiquette.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the\r\nmystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he\r\nfelt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly\r\nrejoining:\r\n\r\n—Simple? I shouldn’t think that is the proper word. Of course, I grant\r\nyou, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a\r\nblue moon. But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for\r\ninstance to invent those rays Röntgen did or the telescope like Edison,\r\nthough I believe it was before his time Galileo was the man, I mean,\r\nand the same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural\r\nphenomenon such as electricity but it’s a horse of quite another colour\r\nto say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God.\r\n\r\n—O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several\r\nof the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nOn this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they\r\nwere both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference\r\nin their respective ages, clashed.\r\n\r\n—Has been? the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his\r\noriginal point with a smile of unbelief. I’m not so sure about that.\r\nThat’s a matter for everyman’s opinion and, without dragging in the\r\nsectarian side of the business, I beg to differ with you _in toto_\r\nthere. My belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were\r\ngenuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it’s the\r\nbig question of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them\r\nlike _Hamlet_ and Bacon, as, you who know your Shakespeare infinitely\r\nbetter than I, of course I needn’t tell you. Can’t you drink that\r\ncoffee, by the way? Let me stir it. And take a piece of that bun. It’s\r\nlike one of our skipper’s bricks disguised. Still no-one can give what\r\nhe hasn’t got. Try a bit.\r\n\r\n—Couldn’t, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the\r\nmoment refusing to dictate further.\r\n\r\nFaultfinding being a proverbially bad hat Mr Bloom thought well to stir\r\nor try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with\r\nsomething approaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance\r\n(and lucrative) work. To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond\r\nyea or nay did a world of good, shelters such as the present one they\r\nwere in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic\r\nevenings and useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the\r\nlower orders. On the other hand he had a distinct and painful\r\nrecollection they paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been\r\nprominently associated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration\r\nindeed for her pianoplaying. The idea, he was strongly inclined to\r\nbelieve, was to do good and net a profit, there being no competition to\r\nspeak of. Sulphate of copper poison SO4 or something in some dried peas\r\nhe remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he\r\ncouldn’t remember when it was or where. Anyhow inspection, medical\r\ninspection, of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary\r\nwhich possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble’s Vi-Cocoa on\r\naccount of the medical analysis involved.\r\n\r\n—Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being\r\nstirred.\r\n\r\nThus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mug\r\nfrom the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and\r\ntook a sip of the offending beverage.\r\n\r\n—Still it’s solid food, his good genius urged, I’m a stickler for solid\r\nfood, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but\r\nregular meals as the _sine qua non_ for any kind of proper work, mental\r\nor manual. You ought to eat more solid food. You would feel a different\r\nman.\r\n\r\n—Liquids I can eat, Stephen said. But O, oblige me by taking away that\r\nknife. I can’t look at the point of it. It reminds me of Roman history.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated\r\narticle, a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly\r\nRoman or antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was\r\nthe least conspicuous point about it.\r\n\r\n—Our mutual friend’s stories are like himself, Mr Bloom _apropos_ of\r\nknives remarked to his _confidante sotto voce_. Do you think they are\r\ngenuine? He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and\r\nlie like old boots. Look at him.\r\n\r\nYet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was\r\nfull of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it\r\nwas quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire\r\nfabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent\r\nprobability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly\r\naccurate gospel.\r\n\r\nHe had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and\r\nSherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him. Though a\r\nwellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness,\r\nthere was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a\r\njail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to\r\nassociate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill\r\nfraternity. He might even have done for his man supposing it was his\r\nown case he told, as people often did about others, namely, that he\r\nkilled him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in\r\ndurance vile to say nothing of the Antonio personage (no relation to\r\nthe dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our\r\nnational poet) who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above\r\ndescribed. On the other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable\r\nweakness because meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like\r\nthose jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner\r\nwho sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner\r\n_Hesperus_ and etcetera. And when all was said and done the lies a\r\nfellow told about himself couldn’t probably hold a proverbial candle to\r\nthe wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him.\r\n\r\n—Mind you, I’m not saying that it’s all a pure invention, he resumed.\r\nAnalogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with. Giants,\r\nthough that is rather a far cry, you see once in a way, Marcella the\r\nmidget queen. In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some\r\nAztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged, they couldn’t straighten\r\ntheir legs if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he\r\nproceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews\r\nor whatever you like to call them behind the right knee, were utterly\r\npowerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as\r\ngods. There’s an example again of simple souls.\r\n\r\nHowever reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who\r\nreminded him a bit of Ludwig, _alias_ Ledwidge, when he occupied the\r\nboards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the\r\nmanagement in the _Flying Dutchman_, a stupendous success, and his host\r\nof admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him\r\nthough ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually\r\nfell a bit flat as also did trains) there was nothing intrinsically\r\nincompatible about it, he conceded. On the contrary that stab in the\r\nback touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he\r\nwas none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the\r\nfish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in\r\nlittle Italy there near the Coombe were sober thrifty hardworking\r\nfellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless\r\nnecessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to\r\nhave a good old succulent tuckin with garlic _de rigueur_ off him or\r\nher next day on the quiet and, he added, on the cheap.\r\n\r\n—Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like\r\nthat, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own\r\nhands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they\r\ncarry in the abdomen. It comes from the great heat, climate generally.\r\nMy wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half that is. Point of fact she could\r\nactually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in\r\n(technically) Spain, i.e. Gibraltar. She has the Spanish type. Quite\r\ndark, regular brunette, black. I for one certainly believe climate\r\naccounts for character. That’s why I asked you if you wrote your poetry\r\nin Italian.\r\n\r\n—The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very\r\npassionate about ten shillings. _Roberto ruba roba sua_.\r\n\r\n—Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.\r\n\r\n—Then, Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown\r\nlistener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles\r\ntriangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san\r\nTommaso Mastino.\r\n\r\n—It’s in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once. All are washed in the\r\nblood of the sun. Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare\r\nstreet museum today, shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it,\r\nand I was just looking at those antique statues there. The splendid\r\nproportions of hips, bosom. You simply don’t knock against those kind\r\nof women here. An exception here and there. Handsome yes, pretty in a\r\nway you find but what I’m talking about is the female form. Besides\r\nthey have so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly\r\nenhances a woman’s natural beauty, no matter what you say. Rumpled\r\nstockings, it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine but still it’s a\r\nthing I simply hate to see.\r\n\r\nInterest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the\r\nothers got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog,\r\ncollisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing. Shipahoy of course\r\nhad his own say to say. He had doubled the cape a few odd times and\r\nweathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all\r\nthose perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him\r\nor words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.\r\n\r\nSo then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt’s rock, wreck\r\nof that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for\r\nthe moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry\r\nCampbell remembered it _Palme_ on Booterstown strand. That was the talk\r\nof the town that year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of\r\noriginal verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish\r\n_Times_), breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore\r\nin commotion petrified with horror. Then someone said something about\r\nthe case of the s. s. _Lady Cairns_ of Swansea run into by the _Mona_\r\nwhich was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with\r\nall hands on deck. No aid was given. Her master, the _Mona_’s, said he\r\nwas afraid his collision bulkhead would give way. She had no water, it\r\nappears, in her hold.\r\n\r\nAt this stage an incident happened. It having become necessary for him\r\nto unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat.\r\n\r\n—Let me cross your bows mate, he said to his neighbour who was just\r\ngently dropping off into a peaceful doze.\r\n\r\nHe made tracks heavily, slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door,\r\nstepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore\r\ndue left. While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who\r\nnoticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship’s\r\nrum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his\r\nburning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew\r\nand, applying its nozzle to his lips, take a good old delectable swig\r\nout of it with a gurgling noise. The irrepressible Bloom, who also had\r\na shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manœuvre after the\r\ncounterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared\r\nto all intents and purposes, could by straining just perceive him, when\r\nduly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and\r\ngirders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was\r\nall radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved. Some\r\nperson or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by\r\nthe cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a\r\nbrief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor,\r\nevidently giving it a wide berth, eased himself closer at hand, the\r\nnoise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the\r\nground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank. A hoof scooped\r\nanyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled. Slightly\r\ndisturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of\r\nthe corporation stones who, though now broken down and fast breaking\r\nup, was none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now\r\npractically on the parish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin\r\nin all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before\r\nshifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again\r\nin to the arms of Morpheus, a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its\r\nmost virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and\r\nfamiliarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a\r\ncool £ 100 a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass\r\nproceeded to make general ducks and drakes of. And there he was at the\r\nend of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink\r\nwithout a beggarly stiver. He drank needless to be told and it pointed\r\nonly once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of\r\nbusiness if—a big if, however—he had contrived to cure himself of his\r\nparticular partiality.\r\n\r\nAll meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping,\r\ncoastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the\r\nsame thing. A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra\r\nbasin, the only launch that year. Right enough the harbours were there\r\nonly no ships ever called.\r\n\r\nThere were wrecks and wreckers, the keeper said, who was evidently _au\r\nfait_.\r\n\r\nWhat he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only\r\nrock in Galway bay when the Galway harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr\r\nWorthington or some name like that, eh? Ask the then captain, he\r\nadvised them, how much palmoil the British government gave him for that\r\nday’s work, Captain John Lever of the Lever Line.\r\n\r\n—Am I right, skipper? he queried of the sailor, now returning after his\r\nprivate potation and the rest of his exertions.\r\n\r\nThat worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words\r\ngrowled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or\r\nother in seconds or thirds. Mr Bloom’s sharp ears heard him then\r\nexpectorate the plug probably (which it was), so that he must have\r\nlodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and\r\nmaking water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in\r\nquestion. Anyhow in he rolled after his successful\r\nlibation-_cum_-potation, introducing an atmosphere of drink into the\r\n_soirée_, boisterously trolling, like a veritable son of a seacook:\r\n\r\n —The biscuits was as hard as brass\r\n And the beef as salt as Lot’s wife’s arse.\r\n O, Johnny Lever!\r\n Johnny Lever, O!\r\n\r\nAfter which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene\r\nand regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form\r\nprovided. Skin-the-Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to\r\ngrind, was airing his grievances in a forcible-feeble philippic anent\r\nthe natural resources of Ireland or something of that sort which he\r\ndescribed in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none\r\non the face of God’s earth, far and away superior to England, with coal\r\nin large quantities, six million pounds worth of pork exported every\r\nyear, ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained\r\nout of it by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through\r\nthe nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot\r\nmore surplus steam in the same vein. Their conversation accordingly\r\nbecame general and all agreed that that was a fact. You could grow any\r\nmortal thing in Irish soil, he stated, and there was that colonel\r\nEverard down there in Navan growing tobacco. Where would you find\r\nanywhere the like of Irish bacon? But a day of reckoning, he stated\r\n_crescendo_ with no uncertain voice, thoroughly monopolising all the\r\nconversation, was in store for mighty England, despite her power of\r\npelf on account of her crimes. There would be a fall and the greatest\r\nfall in history. The Germans and the Japs were going to have their\r\nlittle lookin, he affirmed. The Boers were the beginning of the end.\r\nBrummagem England was toppling already and her downfall would be\r\nIreland, her Achilles heel, which he explained to them about the\r\nvulnerable point of Achilles, the Greek hero, a point his auditors at\r\nonce seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the\r\ntendon referred to on his boot. His advice to every Irishman was: stay\r\nin the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for Ireland.\r\nIreland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons.\r\n\r\nSilence all round marked the termination of his _finale_. The\r\nimpervious navigator heard these lurid tidings, undismayed.\r\n\r\n—Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a\r\nbit peeved in response to the foregoing truism.\r\n\r\nTo which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper\r\nconcurred but nevertheless held to his main view.\r\n\r\n—Who’s the best troops in the army? the grizzled old veteran irately\r\ninterrogated. And the best jumpers and racers? And the best admirals\r\nand generals we’ve got? Tell me that.\r\n\r\n—The Irish, for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facial\r\nblemishes apart.\r\n\r\n—That’s right, the old tarpaulin corroborated. The Irish catholic\r\npeasant. He’s the backbone of our empire. You know Jem Mullins?\r\n\r\nWhile allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added\r\nhe cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no\r\nIrishman worthy of his salt that served it. Then they began to have a\r\nfew irascible words when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say,\r\nappealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with\r\ninterest so long as they didn’t indulge in recriminations and come to\r\nblows.\r\n\r\nFrom inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was\r\nrather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for,\r\npending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he\r\nwas fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the\r\nchannel, unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for,\r\nrather concealed their strength than the opposite. It was quite on a\r\npar with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred\r\nmillion years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out\r\nand if, as time went on, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all\r\nhe could personally say on the matter was that as a host of\r\ncontingencies, equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it\r\nwas highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both\r\ncountries even though poles apart. Another little interesting point,\r\nthe amours of whores and chummies, to put it in common parlance,\r\nreminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as against\r\nher, more so, in fact. And now, why? So the scene between the pair of\r\nthem, the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris,\r\nthe famous invincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him\r\nforcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing,\r\nthat is, it was prearranged as the lookeron, a student of the human\r\nsoul if anything, the others seeing least of the game. And as for the\r\nlessee or keeper, who probably wasn’t the other person at all, he (B.)\r\ncouldn’t help feeling and most properly it was better to give people\r\nlike that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and\r\nrefuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private\r\nlife and their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a\r\nDannyman coming forward and turning queen’s evidence or king’s now like\r\nDenis or Peter Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated. Quite apart from\r\nthat he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle.\r\nYet, though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his\r\nbosom in any shape or form, he certainly did feel and no denying it\r\n(while inwardly remaining what he was) a certain kind of admiration for\r\na man who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage\r\nof his political convictions (though, personally, he would never be a\r\nparty to any such thing), off the same bat as those love vendettas of\r\nthe south, have her or swing for her, when the husband frequently,\r\nafter some words passed between the two concerning her relations with\r\nthe other lucky mortal (he having had the pair watched), inflicted\r\nfatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative\r\npostnuptial _liaison_ by plunging his knife into her, until it just\r\nstruck him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin-the-Goat, merely drove the car for\r\nthe actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was\r\nreliably informed, actually party to the ambush which, in point of\r\nfact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on. In any case\r\nthat was very ancient history by now and as for our friend, the pseudo\r\nSkin-the-etcetera, he had transparently outlived his welcome. He ought\r\nto have either died naturally or on the scaffold high. Like actresses,\r\nalways farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again.\r\nGenerous to a fault of course, temperamental, no economising or any\r\nidea of the sort, always snapping at the bone for the shadow. So\r\nsimilarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid\r\nof some £. s. d. in the course of his perambulations round the docks in\r\nthe congenial atmosphere of the _Old Ireland_ tavern, come back to Erin\r\nand so on. Then as for the other he had heard not so long before the\r\nsame identical lingo as he told Stephen how he simply but effectually\r\nsilenced the offender.\r\n\r\n—He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured but on the\r\nwhole eventempered person declared, I let slip. He called me a jew and\r\nin a heated fashion offensively. So I without deviating from plain\r\nfacts in the least told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too and\r\nall his family like me though in reality I’m not. That was one for him.\r\nA soft answer turns away wrath. He hadn’t a word to say for himself as\r\neveryone saw. Am I not right?\r\n\r\nHe turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride\r\nat the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to\r\nglean in a kind of a way that it wasn’t all exactly.\r\n\r\n—_Ex quibus_, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or\r\nfour eyes conversing, _Christus_ or Bloom his name is or after all any\r\nother, _secundum carnem_.\r\n\r\n—Of course, Mr B. proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides\r\nof the question. It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to\r\nright and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is\r\nthough every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the\r\ngovernment it deserves. But with a little goodwill all round. It’s all\r\nvery fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual\r\nequality. I resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form. It\r\nnever reaches anything or stops anything. A revolution must come on the\r\ndue instalments plan. It’s a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate\r\npeople because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular,\r\nin the next house so to speak.\r\n\r\n—Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes’ war, Stephen\r\nassented, between Skinner’s alley and Ormond market.\r\n\r\nYes, Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed, entirely endorsing the remark, that\r\nwas overwhelmingly right. And the whole world was full of that sort of\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n—You just took the words out of my mouth, he said. A hocuspocus of\r\nconflicting evidence that candidly you couldn’t remotely...\r\n\r\nAll those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad\r\nblood, from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind,\r\nerroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag, were\r\nvery largely a question of the money question which was at the back of\r\neverything, greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop.\r\n\r\n—They accuse, remarked he audibly. He turned away from the others, who\r\nprobably… and spoke nearer to, so as the others… in case they…\r\n\r\n—Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen’s ear, are accused of\r\nruining. Not a vestige of truth in it, I can safely say. History, would\r\nyou be surprised to learn, proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the\r\ninquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell,\r\nan uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer\r\nfor, imported them. Why? Because they are imbued with the proper\r\nspirit. They are practical and are proved to be so. I don’t want to\r\nindulge in any because you know the standard works on the subject and\r\nthen orthodox as you are. But in the economic, not touching religion,\r\ndomain the priest spells poverty. Spain again, you saw in the war,\r\ncompared with goahead America. Turks. It’s in the dogma. Because if\r\nthey didn’t believe they’d go straight to heaven when they die they’d\r\ntry to live better, at least so I think. That’s the juggle on which the\r\np.p.’s raise the wind on false pretences. I’m, he resumed with dramatic\r\nforce, as good an Irishman as that rude person I told you about at the\r\noutset and I want to see everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes\r\n_pro rata_ having a comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion\r\neither, something in the neighbourhood of £ 300 per annum. That’s the\r\nvital issue at stake and it’s feasible and would be provocative of\r\nfriendlier intercourse between man and man. At least that’s my idea for\r\nwhat it’s worth. I call that patriotism. _Ubi patria_, as we learned a\r\nsmattering of in our classical days in _Alma Mater, vita bene_. Where\r\nyou can live well, the sense is, if you work.\r\n\r\nOver his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this\r\nsynopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular.\r\nHe could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those\r\ncrabs about Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours\r\nof different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere\r\nbeneath or seemed to. Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or\r\ndidn’t say the words the voice he heard said, if you work.\r\n\r\n—Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work.\r\n\r\nThe eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the person\r\nwho owned them pro tem. observed or rather his voice speaking did, all\r\nmust work, have to, together.\r\n\r\n—I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest\r\npossible sense. Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the\r\nthing. Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel\r\nnowadays. That’s work too. Important work. After all, from the little I\r\nknow of you, after all the money expended on your education you are\r\nentitled to recoup yourself and command your price. You have every bit\r\nas much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the\r\npeasant has. What? You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn.\r\nEach is equally important.\r\n\r\n—You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I may\r\nbe important because I belong to the _faubourg Saint Patrice_ called\r\nIreland for short.\r\n\r\n—I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.\r\n\r\n—But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important\r\nbecause it belongs to me.\r\n\r\n—What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he was perhaps under\r\nsome misapprehension. Excuse me. Unfortunately, I didn’t catch the\r\nlatter portion. What was it you...?\r\n\r\nStephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of\r\ncoffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely, adding:\r\n\r\n—We can’t change the country. Let us change the subject.\r\n\r\nAt this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked\r\ndown but in a quandary, as he couldn’t tell exactly what construction\r\nto put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry. The rebuke of some\r\nkind was clearer than the other part. Needless to say the fumes of his\r\nrecent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way\r\nforeign to his sober state. Probably the homelife to which Mr B\r\nattached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he\r\nhadn’t been familiarised with the right sort of people. With a touch of\r\nfear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an\r\nair of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris,\r\nthe eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister,\r\nfailing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind\r\ninstances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in\r\nthe bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves. For\r\ninstance there was the case of O’Callaghan, for one, the halfcrazy\r\nfaddist, respectably connected though of inadequate means, with his mad\r\nvagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a\r\nnuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously\r\nsporting in public a suit of brown paper (a fact). And then the usual\r\n_dénouement_ after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed\r\ninto hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends, after a\r\nstrong hint to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so\r\nas not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law\r\namendment act, certain names of those subpœnaed being handed in but not\r\ndivulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains.\r\nBriefly, putting two and two together, six sixteen which he pointedly\r\nturned a deaf ear to, Antonio and so forth, jockeys and esthetes and\r\nthe tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in\r\nthe house of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne,\r\nthen heir apparent, the other members of the upper ten and other high\r\npersonages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state,\r\nhe reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running\r\ncounter to morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years before\r\nunder their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature, a thing good\r\nMrs Grundy, as the law stands, was terribly down on though not for the\r\nreason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women\r\nchiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another it being\r\nlargely a matter of dress and all the rest of it. Ladies who like\r\ndistinctive underclothing should, and every welltailored man must,\r\ntrying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of\r\na genuine filip to acts of impropriety between the two, she unbuttoned\r\nhis and then he untied her, mind the pin, whereas savages in the\r\ncannibal islands, say, at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a\r\ncontinental. However, reverting to the original, there were on the\r\nother hand others who had forced their way to the top from the lowest\r\nrung by the aid of their bootstraps. Sheer force of natural genius,\r\nthat. With brains, sir.\r\n\r\nFor which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty even\r\nto wait on and profit by the unlookedfor occasion though why he could\r\nnot exactly tell being as it was already several shillings to the bad\r\nhaving in fact let himself in for it. Still to cultivate the\r\nacquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food\r\nfor reflection would amply repay any small. Intellectual stimulation,\r\nas such, was, he felt, from time to time a firstrate tonic for the\r\nmind. Added to which was the coincidence of meeting, discussion, dance,\r\nrow, old salt of the here today and gone tomorrow type, night loafers,\r\nthe whole galaxy of events, all went to make up a miniature cameo of\r\nthe world we live in especially as the lives of the submerged tenth,\r\nviz. coalminers, divers, scavengers etc., were very much under the\r\nmicroscope lately. To improve the shining hour he wondered whether he\r\nmight meet with anything approaching the same luck as Mr Philip Beaufoy\r\nif taken down in writing suppose he were to pen something out of the\r\ncommon groove (as he fully intended doing) at the rate of one guinea\r\nper column. _My Experiences_, let us say, _in a Cabman’s Shelter_.\r\n\r\nThe pink edition extra sporting of the _Telegraph_ tell a graphic lie\r\nlay, as luck would have it, beside his elbow and as he was just\r\npuzzling again, far from satisfied, over a country belonging to him and\r\nthe preceding rebus the vessel came from Bridgwater and the postcard\r\nwas addressed A. Boudin find the captain’s age, his eyes went aimlessly\r\nover the respective captions which came under his special province the\r\nallembracing give us this day our daily press. First he got a bit of a\r\nstart but it turned out to be only something about somebody named H. du\r\nBoyes, agent for typewriters or something like that. Great battle,\r\nTokio.

Ascot meeting, the Gold Cup.\r\nVictory of outsider _Throwaway_ recalls Derby of ’92 when Capt.\r\nMarshall’s dark horse _Sir Hugo_ captured the blue ribband at long\r\nodds. New York disaster. Thousand lives lost. Foot and Mouth. Funeral\r\nof the late Mr Patrick Dignam.\r\n\r\nSo to change the subject he read about Dignam R. I. P. which, he\r\nreflected, was anything but a gay sendoff. Or a change of address\r\nanyway.\r\n\r\n—_This morning_ (Hynes put it in of course) _the remains of the late Mr\r\nPatrick Dignam were removed from his residence, no 9 Newbridge Avenue,\r\nSandymount, for interment in Glasnevin. The deceased gentleman was a\r\nmost popular and genial personality in city life and his demise after a\r\nbrief illness came as a great shock to citizens of all classes by whom\r\nhe is deeply regretted. The obsequies, at which many friends of the\r\ndeceased were present, were carried out_ (certainly Hynes wrote it with\r\na nudge from Corny) _by Messrs H. J. O’Neill and Son, 164 North Strand\r\nRoad. The mourners included: Patk. Dignam (son), Bernard Corrigan\r\n(brother-in-law), Jno.

M’Coy\r\nand Stephen Dedalus B. A. who were conspicuous, needless to say, by\r\ntheir total absence (to say nothing of M’Intosh) L. Boom pointed it out\r\nto his companion B. A. engaged in stifling another yawn, half\r\nnervousness, not forgetting the usual crop of nonsensical howlers of\r\nmisprints.\r\n\r\n—Is that first epistle to the Hebrews, he asked as soon as his bottom\r\njaw would let him, in? Text: open thy mouth and put thy foot in it.\r\n\r\n—It is. Really, Mr Bloom said (though first he fancied he alluded to\r\nthe archbishop till he added about foot and mouth with which there\r\ncould be no possible connection) overjoyed to set his mind at rest and\r\na bit flabbergasted at Myles Crawford’s after all managing to. There.\r\n\r\nWhile the other was reading it on page two Boom (to give him for the\r\nnonce his new misnomer) whiled away a few odd leisure moments in fits\r\nand starts with the account of the third event at Ascot on page three,\r\nhis side.

Though\r\nthat halfbaked Lyons ran off at a tangent in his impetuosity to get\r\nleft. Of course gambling eminently lent itself to that sort of thing\r\nthough as the event turned out the poor fool hadn’t much reason to\r\ncongratulate himself on his pick, the forlorn hope. Guesswork it\r\nreduced itself to eventually.\r\n\r\n—There was every indication they would arrive at that, he, Bloom, said.\r\n\r\n—Who? the other, whose hand by the way was hurt, said.\r\n\r\nOne morning you would open the paper, the cabman affirmed, and read:\r\n_Return of Parnell_. He bet them what they liked. A Dublin fusilier was\r\nin that shelter one night and said he saw him in South Africa. Pride it\r\nwas killed him. He ought to have done away with himself or lain low for\r\na time after committee room no 15 until he was his old self again with\r\nno-one to point a finger at him. Then they would all to a man have gone\r\ndown on their marrowbones to him to come back when he had recovered his\r\nsenses. Dead he wasn’t. Simply absconded somewhere. The coffin they\r\nbrought over was full of stones. He changed his name to De Wet, the\r\nBoer general. He made a mistake to fight the priests. And so forth and\r\nso on.\r\n\r\nAll the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their\r\nmemories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and\r\nnot singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it\r\nwas twenty odd years. Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow\r\nof truth in the stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highly\r\ninadvisable, all things considered. Something evidently riled them in\r\nhis death. Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just\r\nwhen his various different political arrangements were nearing\r\ncompletion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having\r\nneglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold\r\nresulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his\r\nroom till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a\r\nfortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find\r\nthe job was taken out of their hands. Of course nobody being acquainted\r\nwith his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his\r\nwhereabouts which were decidedly of the _Alice, where art thou_ order\r\neven prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and\r\nStewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within\r\nthe bounds of possibility. Naturally then it would prey on his mind as\r\na born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure,\r\na sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged\r\nfeet, whereas Messrs So and So who, though they weren’t even a patch on\r\nthe former man, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were\r\nvery few and far between. It certainly pointed a moral, the idol with\r\nfeet of clay, and then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on\r\nhim with mutual mudslinging. And the identical same with murderers. You\r\nhad to come back. That haunting sense kind of drew you. To show the\r\nunderstudy in the title _rôle_ how to. He saw him once on the\r\nauspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the _Insuppressible_\r\nor was it _United Ireland_, a privilege he keenly appreciated, and, in\r\npoint of fact, handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he\r\nsaid _Thank you_, excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid\r\nexterior notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the\r\ncup and the lip: what’s bred in the bone. Still as regards return. You\r\nwere a lucky dog if they didn’t set the terrier at you directly you got\r\nback. Then a lot of shillyshally usually followed, Tom for and Dick and\r\nHarry against. And then, number one, you came up against the man in\r\npossession and had to produce your credentials like the claimant in the\r\nTichborne case, Roger Charles Tichborne, _Bella_ was the boat’s name to\r\nthe best of his recollection he, the heir, went down in as the evidence\r\nwent to show and there was a tattoo mark too in Indian ink, lord Bellew\r\nwas it, as he might very easily have picked up the details from some\r\npal on board ship and then, when got up to tally with the description\r\ngiven, introduce himself with: _Excuse me, my name is So and So_ or\r\nsome such commonplace remark. A more prudent course, as Bloom said to\r\nthe not over effusive, in fact like the distinguished personage under\r\ndiscussion beside him, would have been to sound the lie of the land\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n—That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen proprietor\r\ncommented. She put the first nail in his coffin.\r\n\r\n—Fine lump of a woman all the same, the _soi-disant_ townclerk Henry\r\nCampbell remarked, and plenty of her. She loosened many a man’s thighs.\r\nI seen her picture in a barber’s. The husband was a captain or an\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\n—Ay, Skin-the-Goat amusingly added, he was and a cottonball one.\r\n\r\nThis gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair\r\namount of laughter among his _entourage_. As regards Bloom he, without\r\nthe faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the\r\ndoor and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused\r\nextraordinary interest at the time when the facts, to make matters\r\nworse, were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed\r\nbetween them full of sweet nothings. First it was strictly Platonic\r\ntill nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till\r\nbit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of\r\nthe town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not\r\na few evildisposed, however, who were resolved upon encompassing his\r\ndownfall though the thing was public property all along though not to\r\nanything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed\r\ninto. Since their names were coupled, though, since he was her declared\r\nfavourite, where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the\r\nrank and file from the housetops, the fact, namely, that he had shared\r\nher bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went\r\nthrough the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape\r\nof witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a\r\nparticular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment\r\nwith the assistance of a ladder in night apparel, having gained\r\nadmittance in the same fashion, a fact the weeklies, addicted to the\r\nlubric a little, simply coined shoals of money out of. Whereas the\r\nsimple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not\r\nbeing up to the scratch, with nothing in common between them beyond the\r\nname, and then a real man arriving on the scene, strong to the verge of\r\nweakness, falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home\r\nties, the usual sequel, to bask in the loved one’s smiles. The eternal\r\nquestion of the life connubial, needless to say, cropped up. Can real\r\nlove, supposing there happens to be another chap in the case, exist\r\nbetween married folk? Poser. Though it was no concern of theirs\r\nabsolutely if he regarded her with affection, carried away by a wave of\r\nfolly. A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented\r\nobviously by gifts of a high order, as compared with the other military\r\nsupernumerary that is (who was just the usual everyday _farewell, my\r\ngallant captain_ kind of an individual in the light dragoons, the 18th\r\nhussars to be accurate) and inflammable doubtless (the fallen leader,\r\nthat is, not the other) in his own peculiar way which she of course,\r\nwoman, quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame\r\nwhich he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the\r\ngospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch adherents, and his beloved\r\nevicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts\r\nof the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that\r\nexceeded their most sanguine expectations, very effectually cooked his\r\nmatrimonial goose, thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in\r\nthe same way as the fabled ass’s kick. Looking back now in a\r\nretrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream. And then\r\ncoming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without\r\nsaying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the\r\ntimes. Why, as he reflected, Irishtown strand, a locality he had not\r\nbeen in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since, as\r\nit happened, he went to reside on the north side. North or south,\r\nhowever, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and\r\nsimple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the\r\nvery thing he was saying as she also was Spanish or half so, types that\r\nwouldn’t do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting\r\nevery shred of decency to the winds.\r\n\r\n—Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom said to\r\nStephen, about blood and the sun. And, if I don’t greatly mistake she\r\nwas Spanish too.\r\n\r\n—The king of Spain’s daughter, Stephen answered, adding something or\r\nother rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and\r\nthe first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and\r\nso many.\r\n\r\n—Was she? Bloom ejaculated, surprised though not astonished by any\r\nmeans, I never heard that rumour before. Possible, especially there, it\r\nwas as she lived there. So, Spain.\r\n\r\nCarefully avoiding a book in his pocket _Sweets of_, which reminded him\r\nby the by of that Capel street library book out of date, he took out\r\nhis pocketbook and, turning over the various contents it contained\r\nrapidly finally he.\r\n\r\n—Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a faded\r\nphoto which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type?\r\n\r\nStephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large\r\nsized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she\r\nwas in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously\r\nlow for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than\r\nvision of breasts, her full lips parted and some perfect teeth,\r\nstanding near, ostensibly with gravity, a piano on the rest of which\r\nwas _In Old Madrid_, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all\r\nthe vogue. Her (the lady’s) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about\r\nto smile about something to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland\r\nstreet, Dublin’s premier photographic artist, being responsible for the\r\nesthetic execution.\r\n\r\n—Mrs Bloom, my wife the _prima donna_ Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom\r\nindicated. Taken a few years since. In or about ninety six. Very like\r\nher then.\r\n\r\nBeside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his\r\nlegal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major\r\nBrian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a\r\nsinger having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered\r\nbarely sweet sixteen. As for the face it was a speaking likeness in\r\nexpression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a\r\nlot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage\r\nin that getup. She could without difficulty, he said, have posed for\r\nthe ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the. He dwelt,\r\nbeing a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in\r\ngeneral developmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that\r\nafternoon he had seen those Grecian statues, perfectly developed as\r\nworks of art, in the National Museum. Marble could give the original,\r\nshoulders, back, all the symmetry, all the rest. Yes, puritanisme, it\r\ndoes though, Saint Joseph’s sovereign thievery alors (Bandez!) Figne\r\ntoi trop. Whereas no photo could because it simply wasn’t art in a\r\nword.\r\n\r\nThe spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar’s\r\ngood example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to\r\nspeak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the\r\nbeauty for himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in\r\nitself which the camera could not at all do justice to. But it was\r\nscarcely professional etiquette so. Though it was a warm pleasant sort\r\nof a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering, for\r\nsunshine after storm. And he did feel a kind of need there and then to\r\nfollow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by\r\nmoving a motion. Nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly\r\nsoiled photo creased by opulent curves, none the worse for wear\r\nhowever, and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further\r\nincreasing the other’s possible embarrassment while gauging her\r\nsymmetry of heaving _embonpoint_. In fact the slight soiling was only\r\nan added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled, good as new,\r\nmuch better in fact with the starch out. Suppose she was gone when he?\r\nI looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely\r\nas a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning\r\nlittered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses\r\n(_sic_) in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately\r\nbeside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray.\r\n\r\nThe vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated,\r\n_distingué_ and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of\r\nthe bunch though you wouldn’t think he had it in him yet you would.\r\nBesides he said the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it\r\nwas though at the moment she was distinctly stouter. And why not? An\r\nawful lot of makebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a\r\nlifelong slur with the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same\r\nold matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or\r\nthe newest stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about\r\nthe whole business. How they were fated to meet and an attachment\r\nsprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the\r\npublic eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy\r\nand compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they\r\nopenly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside\r\nhotel and relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in\r\ndue course intimate. Then the decree _nisi_ and the King’s proctor\r\ntries to show cause why and, he failing to quash it, _nisi_ was made\r\nabsolute. But as for that the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they\r\nlargely were in one another, could safely afford to ignore it as they\r\nvery largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor\r\nwho filed a petition for the party wronged in due course. He, B,\r\nenjoyed the distinction of being close to Erin’s uncrowned king in the\r\nflesh when the thing occurred on the historic _fracas_ when the fallen\r\nleader’s, who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when\r\nclothed in the mantle of adultery, (leader’s) trusty henchmen to the\r\nnumber of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated\r\ninto the printing works of the _Insuppressible_ or no it was _United\r\nIreland_ (a by no means by the by appropriate appellative) and broke up\r\nthe typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of\r\nsome scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the O’Brienite\r\nscribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile\r\ntribune’s private morals. Though palpably a radically altered man he\r\nwas still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with\r\nthat look of settled purpose which went a long way with the\r\nshillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that\r\ntheir idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which\r\nshe, however, was the first to perceive. As those were particularly hot\r\ntimes in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a\r\nnasty prod of some chap’s elbow in the crowd that of course congregated\r\nlodging some place about the pit of the stomach, fortunately not of a\r\ngrave character. His hat (Parnell’s) a silk one was inadvertently\r\nknocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was the man who\r\npicked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to\r\nreturn it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity)\r\nwho panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat\r\nat the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the\r\ncountry he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more for the kudos\r\nof the thing than anything else, what’s bred in the bone instilled into\r\nhim in infancy at his mother’s knee in the shape of knowing what good\r\nform was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and\r\nthanked him with perfect _aplomb_, saying: _Thank you, sir_, though in\r\na very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal\r\nprofession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the\r\ncourse of the day, history repeating itself with a difference, after\r\nthe burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory\r\nafter the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes\r\nof the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest, laughing\r\nimmoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the\r\nwherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case\r\nfor the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate\r\nhusband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter\r\nfrom the usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them at the\r\ncrucial moment in a loving position locked in one another’s arms,\r\ndrawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a\r\ndomestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord\r\nand master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not\r\nreceive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would\r\noverlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes\r\nthough possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as\r\nquite possibly there were several others. He personally, being of a\r\nsceptical bias, believed and didn’t make the smallest bones about\r\nsaying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging\r\naround on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was the\r\nbest wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the\r\nsake of argument, when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of\r\nwedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to\r\npress their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being\r\nthat her affections centred on another, the cause of many _liaisons_\r\nbetween still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty\r\nand younger men, no doubt as several famous cases of feminine\r\ninfatuation proved up to the hilt.\r\n\r\nIt was a thousand pities a young fellow, blessed with an allowance of\r\nbrains as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time\r\nwith profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last\r\nhim his lifetime. In the nature of single blessedness he would one day\r\ntake unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the\r\ninterim ladies’ society was a _conditio sine qua non_ though he had the\r\ngravest possible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump\r\nStephen about Miss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular\r\nlodestar who brought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning), as\r\nto whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl\r\ncourtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to\r\ntheir names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of\r\ncomplimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers’ ways and\r\nflowers and chocs. To think of him house and homeless, rooked by some\r\nlandlady worse than any stepmother, was really too bad at his age. The\r\nqueer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who\r\nwas several years the other’s senior or like his father but something\r\nsubstantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made\r\non unadulterated maternal nutriment or, failing that, the homely Humpty\r\nDumpty boiled.\r\n\r\n—At what o’clock did you dine? he questioned of the slim form and tired\r\nthough unwrinkled face.\r\n\r\n—Some time yesterday, Stephen said.\r\n\r\n—Yesterday! exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow\r\nFriday. Ah, you mean it’s after twelve!\r\n\r\n—The day before yesterday, Stephen said, improving on himself.\r\n\r\nLiterally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected.\r\nThough they didn’t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there\r\nsomehow was as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the\r\none train of thought. At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some\r\nscore of years previously when he had been a _quasi_ aspirant to\r\nparliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in\r\nretrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a\r\nsneaking regard for those same ultra ideas. For instance when the\r\nevicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked largely\r\nin people’s mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a\r\ncopper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which\r\nwouldn’t exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all\r\nevents was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the\r\ntrend of modern opinion (a partiality, however, which, realising his\r\nmistake, he was subsequently partially cured of) and even was twitted\r\nwith going a step farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he\r\nat one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he\r\nstrongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion\r\nby our friend at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan’s so that\r\nhe, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of\r\nmortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him\r\n(metaphorically) one in the gizzard though, so far as politics\r\nthemselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties\r\ninvariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity\r\nand the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on\r\nfine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.\r\n\r\nAnyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it\r\nwas, it was high time to be retiring for the night. The crux was it was\r\na bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue\r\n(somebody having a temper of her own sometimes) and spoil the hash\r\naltogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog (breed\r\nunknown) with a lame paw (not that the cases were either identical or\r\nthe reverse though he had hurt his hand too) to Ontario Terrace as he\r\nvery distinctly remembered, having been there, so to speak. On the\r\nother hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount\r\nor Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which\r\nof the two alternatives. Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved\r\nhim to avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things\r\nconsidered. His initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or\r\nnot over effusive but it grew on him someway. For one thing he mightn’t\r\nwhat you call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried\r\nhim was he didn’t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly,\r\nsupposing he did entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very\r\ngreat personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in\r\nhis way or some wardrobe, if found suitable. At all events he wound up\r\nby concluding, eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of\r\nEpps’s cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two\r\nand overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands\r\nand as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast\r\namount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort\r\nwas kicked up. A move had to be made because that merry old soul, the\r\ngrasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn’t\r\nappear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly\r\nbeloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger’s bawdyhouse\r\nof retired beauties where age was no bar off Sheriff street lower would\r\nbe the best clue to that equivocal character’s whereabouts for a few\r\ndays to come, alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids’) with\r\nsixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to\r\nfreeze the marrow of anybody’s bones and mauling their largesized\r\ncharms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment\r\nof large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for\r\nas to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address, as\r\nMr Algebra remarks _passim_. At the same time he inwardly chuckled over\r\nhis gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being\r\na jew. People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what\r\nproperly riled them was a bite from a sheep. The most vulnerable point\r\ntoo of tender Achilles. Your god was a jew. Because mostly they\r\nappeared to imagine he came from Carrick-on-Shannon or somewhereabouts\r\nin the county Sligo.\r\n\r\n—I propose, our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while\r\nprudently pocketing her photo, as it’s rather stuffy here you just come\r\nhome with me and talk things over. My diggings are quite close in the\r\nvicinity. You can’t drink that stuff. Do you like cocoa? Wait. I’ll\r\njust pay this lot.\r\n\r\nThe best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain\r\nsailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the\r\nkeeper of the shanty who didn’t seem to.\r\n\r\n—Yes, that’s the best, he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of\r\nthat Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his (B’s) busy brain,\r\neducation (the genuine article), literature, journalism, prize titbits,\r\nup to date billing, concert tours in English watering resorts packed\r\nwith hydros and seaside theatres, turning money away, duets in Italian\r\nwith the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other\r\nthings, no necessity, of course, to tell the world and his wife from\r\nthe housetops about it, and a slice of luck. An opening was all was\r\nwanted. Because he more than suspected he had his father’s voice to\r\nbank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be\r\njust as well, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in the\r\ndirection of that particular red herring just to.\r\n\r\nThe cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former\r\nviceroy, earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers’ association\r\ndinner in London somewhere. Silence with a yawn or two accompanied this\r\nthrilling announcement. Then the old specimen in the corner who\r\nappeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir Anthony\r\nMacDonnell had left Euston for the chief secretary’s lodge or words to\r\nthat effect. To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered\r\nwhy.\r\n\r\n—Give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the ancient mariner\r\nput in, manifesting some natural impatience.\r\n\r\n—And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed.\r\n\r\nThe sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles\r\nwhich he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears.\r\n\r\n—Are you bad in the eyes? the sympathetic personage like the townclerk\r\nqueried.\r\n\r\n—Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was a\r\nbit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of seagreen\r\nportholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading.\r\nSand in the Red Sea done that. One time I could read a book in the\r\ndark, manner of speaking. _The Arabian Nights Entertainment_ was my\r\nfavourite and _Red as a Rose is She._\r\n\r\nHereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what,\r\nfound drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a\r\nhundred and something second wicket not out for Notts, during which\r\ntime (completely regardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied\r\nloosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched\r\nhim as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were\r\nsufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions,\r\nthat is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial\r\nremark.\r\n\r\nTo cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first\r\nto rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first\r\nand foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for\r\nthe occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine\r\nhost as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were\r\nnot looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a\r\ngrand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four\r\ncoppers, literally the last of the Mohicans), he having previously\r\nspotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him\r\nin unmistakable figures, coffee 2d, confectionery do, and honestly well\r\nworth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark.\r\n\r\n—Come, he counselled to close the _séance_.\r\n\r\nSeeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the\r\nshelter or shanty together and the _élite_ society of oilskin and\r\ncompany whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their\r\n_dolce far niente_. Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and\r\nfagged out, paused at the, for a moment, the door.\r\n\r\n—One thing I never understood, he said to be original on the spur of\r\nthe moment. Why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs\r\nupside down, on the tables in cafés. To which impromptu the\r\nneverfailing Bloom replied without a moment’s hesitation, saying\r\nstraight off:\r\n\r\n—To sweep the floor in the morning.\r\n\r\nSo saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same\r\ntime apologetic to get on his companion’s right, a habit of his, by the\r\nbye, his right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles. The\r\nnight air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit\r\nweak on his pins.\r\n\r\n—It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in a\r\nmoment. The only thing is to walk then you’ll feel a different man.\r\nCome. It’s not far. Lean on me.\r\n\r\nAccordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen’s right and led him on\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n—Yes, Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange\r\nkind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and\r\nall that.\r\n\r\nAnyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc. where the\r\nmunicipal supernumerary, ex Gumley, was still to all intents and\r\npurposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming\r\nof fresh fields and pastures new. And _apropos_ of coffin of stones the\r\nanalogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the\r\npart of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the\r\ntime of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the\r\nselfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.\r\n\r\nSo they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which\r\nBloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made\r\ntracks arm in arm across Beresford place. Wagnerian music, though\r\nconfessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to\r\nfollow at the first go-off but the music of Mercadante’s _Huguenots_,\r\nMeyerbeer’s _Seven Last Words on the Cross_ and Mozart’s _Twelfth Mass_\r\nhe simply revelled in, the _Gloria_ in that being, to his mind, the\r\nacme of first class music as such, literally knocking everything else\r\ninto a cocked hat. He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the\r\ncatholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line\r\nsuch as those Moody and Sankey hymns or _Bid me to live and I will live\r\nthy protestant to be_. He also yielded to none in his admiration of\r\nRossini’s _Stabat Mater_, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers,\r\nin which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable\r\nsensation, he might safely say, greatly adding to her other laurels and\r\nputting the others totally in the shade, in the jesuit fathers’ church\r\nin upper Gardiner street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the\r\ndoors to hear her with virtuosos, or _virtuosi_ rather. There was the\r\nunanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it\r\nto say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was\r\na generally voiced desire for an encore. On the whole though favouring\r\npreferably light opera of the _Don Giovanni_ description and _Martha_,\r\na gem in its line, he had a _penchant_, though with only a surface\r\nknowledge, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn. And\r\ntalking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old\r\nfavourites, he mentioned _par excellence_ Lionel’s air in _Martha,\r\nM’appari_, which, curiously enough, he had heard or overheard, to be\r\nmore accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from\r\nthe lips of Stephen’s respected father, sung to perfection, a study of\r\nthe number, in fact, which made all the others take a back seat.\r\nStephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he didn’t sing it but\r\nlaunched out into praises of Shakespeare’s songs, at least of in or\r\nabout that period, the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter lane near\r\nGerard the herbalist, who _anno ludendo hausi, Doulandus_, an\r\ninstrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch,\r\nwhom B. did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded\r\nfamiliar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their _dux_\r\nand _comes_ conceits and Byrd (William) who played the virginals, he\r\nsaid, in the Queen’s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one\r\nTomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull.\r\n\r\nOn the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond\r\nthe swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground,\r\nbrushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not\r\nperfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to\r\nsixtyfive guineas and John Bull. He inquired if it was John Bull the\r\npolitical celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical\r\nnames, as a striking coincidence.\r\n\r\nBy the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving,\r\nBloom, who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the other’s\r\nsleeve gently, jocosely remarking:\r\n\r\n—Our lives are in peril tonight. Beware of the steamroller.\r\n\r\nThey thereupon stopped. Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth\r\nanything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite\r\nnear so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even\r\nflesh because palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a\r\nblackbuttocker, a taildangler, a headhanger putting his hind foot\r\nforemost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with\r\nhis thoughts. But such a good poor brute he was sorry he hadn’t a lump\r\nof sugar but, as he wisely reflected, you could scarcely be prepared\r\nfor every emergency that might crop up. He was just a big nervous\r\nfoolish noodly kind of a horse, without a second care in the world. But\r\neven a dog, he reflected, take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan’s, of the\r\nsame size, would be a holy horror to face. But it was no animal’s fault\r\nin particular if he was built that way like the camel, ship of the\r\ndesert, distilling grapes into potheen in his hump. Nine tenths of them\r\nall could be caged or trained, nothing beyond the art of man barring\r\nthe bees. Whale with a harpoon hairpin, alligator tickle the small of\r\nhis back and he sees the joke, chalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my\r\neagle eye. These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field\r\noccupied his mind somewhat distracted from Stephen’s words while the\r\nship of the street was manœuvring and Stephen went on about the highly\r\ninteresting old.\r\n\r\n—What’s this I was saying? Ah, yes! My wife, he intimated, plunging _in\r\nmedias res_, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your\r\nacquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.\r\n\r\nHe looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen,\r\nimage of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome\r\nblackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after\r\nas he was perhaps not that way built.\r\n\r\nStill, supposing he had his father’s gift as he more than suspected, it\r\nopened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall’s Irish\r\nindustries, concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nExquisite variations he was now describing on an air _Youth here has\r\nEnd_ by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows\r\ncome from. Even more he liked an old German song of _Johannes Jeep_\r\nabout the clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men,\r\nwhich boggled Bloom a bit:\r\n\r\n Von der Sirenen Listigkeit\r\n Tun die Poeten dichten.\r\n\r\nThese opening bars he sang and translated _extempore_. Bloom, nodding,\r\nsaid he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which\r\nhe did.\r\n\r\nA phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons,\r\nwhich Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could\r\neasily, if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice\r\nproduction such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the\r\nbargain, command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and\r\nprocure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an _entrée_ into\r\nfashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial\r\nmagnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his\r\nuniversity degree of B. A. (a huge ad in its way) and gentlemanly\r\nbearing to all the more influence the good impression he would\r\ninfallibly score a distinct success, being blessed with brains which\r\nalso could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites, if his\r\nclothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into\r\ntheir good graces as he, a youthful tyro in society’s sartorial\r\nniceties, hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate\r\nagainst you. It was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily\r\nforesee him participating in their musical and artistic\r\n_conversaziones_ during the festivities of the Christmas season, for\r\nchoice, causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and\r\nbeing made a lot of by ladies out for sensation, cases of which, as he\r\nhappened to know, were on record—in fact, without giving the show away,\r\nhe himself once upon a time, if he cared to, could easily have. Added\r\nto which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be\r\nsneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition fees. Not, he\r\nparenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily\r\nembrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of\r\ntime. But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and\r\nboth monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity\r\nin the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a\r\ncheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped. Besides, though\r\ntaste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original music like that,\r\ndifferent from the conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue\r\nas it would be a decided novelty for Dublin’s musical world after the\r\nusual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public\r\nby Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their _genus omne_. Yes,\r\nbeyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and\r\nhe had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high\r\nplace in the city’s esteem where he could command a stiff figure and,\r\nbooking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the King street\r\nhouse, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs,\r\nso to speak, a big _if_, however, with some impetus of the goahead sort\r\nto obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too\r\nmuch fêted prince of good fellows. And it need not detract from the\r\nother by one iota as, being his own master, he would have heaps of time\r\nto practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing\r\nwithout its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything\r\nderogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone. In fact, he\r\nhad the ball at his feet and that was the very reason why the other,\r\npossessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort,\r\nhung on to him at all.\r\n\r\nThe horse was just then. And later on at a propitious opportunity he\r\npurposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on\r\nthe _fools step in where angels_ principle, advising him to sever his\r\nconnection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was\r\nprone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious\r\npretext when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call\r\nit which in Bloom’s humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side\r\nof a person’s character, no pun intended.\r\n\r\nThe horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted\r\nand, rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting\r\nfall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three\r\nsmoking globes of turds. Slowly three times, one after another, from a\r\nfull crupper he mired. And humanely his driver waited till he (or she)\r\nhad ended, patient in his scythed car.\r\n\r\nSide by side Bloom, profiting by the _contretemps_, with Stephen passed\r\nthrough the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping\r\nover a strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower,\r\nStephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad.\r\n\r\n Und alle Schiffe brücken.\r\n\r\nThe driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely\r\nwatched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black,\r\none full, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, _to be married by\r\nFather Maher_. As they walked they at times stopped and walked again\r\ncontinuing their _tête à tête_ (which, of course, he was utterly out\r\nof) about sirens, enemies of man’s reason, mingled with a number of\r\nother topics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the\r\nkind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in\r\nthe sleeper car who in any case couldn’t possibly hear because they\r\nwere too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner\r\nstreet _and looked after their lowbacked car_.\r\n\n[ 17 ]\r\n\nWhat parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?\r\n\r\nStarting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they\r\nfollowed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and\r\nMountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left,\r\nGardiner’s place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of\r\nTemple street: then, at reduced pace with interruptions of halt,\r\nbearing right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place.\r\nApproaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the\r\ncircus before George’s church diametrically, the chord in any circle\r\nbeing less than the arc which it subtends.\r\n\r\nOf what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?\r\n\r\nMusic, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman,\r\nprostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and\r\nglowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed\r\ncorporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church,\r\necclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers,\r\nthe study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the\r\npresabbath, Stephen’s collapse.\r\n\r\nDid Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their\r\nrespective like and unlike reactions to experience?\r\n\r\nBoth were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to\r\nplastic or pictorial. Both preferred a continental to an insular manner\r\nof life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence. Both\r\nindurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of\r\nheterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox\r\nreligious, national, social and ethical doctrines. Both admitted the\r\nalternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual\r\nmagnetism.\r\n\r\nWere their views on some points divergent?\r\n\r\nStephen dissented openly from Bloom’s views on the importance of\r\ndietary and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen’s\r\nviews on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature.\r\nBloom assented covertly to Stephen’s rectification of the anachronism\r\ninvolved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to\r\nchristianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus,\r\nson of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign\r\nof Leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt\r\n(† 266 A.D.), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty\r\nand interred at Rossnaree. The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric\r\ninanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of\r\nadulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and\r\nthe velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen\r\nattributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both\r\nfrom two different points of observation Sandycove and Dublin) at first\r\nno bigger than a woman’s hand.\r\n\r\nWas there one point on which their views were equal and negative?\r\n\r\nThe influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining\r\nparaheliotropic trees.\r\n\r\nHad Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in\r\nthe past?\r\n\r\nIn 1884 with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public\r\nthoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard’s corner and\r\nLeonard’s corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield\r\navenue. In 1885 with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the\r\nwall between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of\r\nUppercross. In 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances and\r\nprospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class\r\nrailway carriages of suburban lines. In 1888 frequently with major\r\nBrian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and\r\nseparately on the lounge in Matthew Dillon’s house in Roundtown. Once\r\nin 1892 and once in 1893 with Julius (Juda) Mastiansky, on both\r\noccasions in the parlour of his (Bloom’s) house in Lombard street,\r\nwest.\r\n\r\nWhat reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884, 1885,\r\n1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did Bloom make before their arrival at\r\ntheir destination?\r\n\r\nHe reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual\r\ndevelopment and experience was regressively accompanied by a\r\nrestriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations.\r\n\r\nAs in what ways?\r\n\r\nFrom inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received:\r\nexistence with existence he was with any as any with any: from\r\nexistence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.\r\n\r\nWhat act did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination?\r\n\r\nAt the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers,\r\nnumber 7 Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back\r\npocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey.\r\n\r\nWas it there?\r\n\r\nIt was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on\r\nthe day but one preceding.\r\n\r\nWhy was he doubly irritated?\r\n\r\nBecause he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded\r\nhimself twice not to forget.\r\n\r\nWhat were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly\r\n(respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple?\r\n\r\nTo enter or not to enter. To knock or not to knock.\r\n\r\nBloom’s decision?\r\n\r\nA stratagem. Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the\r\narea railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at\r\nthe lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its\r\nlength of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten\r\ninches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in\r\nspace by separating himself from the railings and crouching in\r\npreparation for the impact of the fall.\r\n\r\nDid he fall?\r\n\r\nBy his body’s known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in\r\navoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for\r\nperiodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Froedman,\r\npharmaceutical chemist of 19 Frederick street, north, on the last feast\r\nof the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year\r\none thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era (jewish era\r\nfive thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammadan era one thousand\r\nthree hundred and twentytwo), golden number 5, epact 13, solar cycle 9,\r\ndominical letters C B, Roman indiction 2, Julian period 6617, MCMIV.\r\n\r\nDid he rise uninjured by concussion?\r\n\r\nRegaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by\r\nthe impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force\r\nat its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied\r\nat its fulcrum, gained retarded access to the kitchen through the\r\nsubadjacent scullery, ignited a lucifer match by friction, set free\r\ninflammable coal gas by turning on the ventcock, lit a high flame\r\nwhich, by regulating, he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit\r\nfinally a portable candle.\r\n\r\nWhat discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?\r\n\r\nReclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent\r\nkitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 CP, a man lighting a\r\ncandle of 1 CP, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man\r\nleaving the kitchen holding a candle.\r\n\r\nDid the man reappear elsewhere?\r\n\r\nAfter a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible\r\nthrough the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the\r\nhalldoor. The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges. In the open\r\nspace of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his\r\ncandle.\r\n\r\nDid Stephen obey his sign?\r\n\r\nYes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and\r\nfollowed softly along the hallway the man’s back and listed feet and\r\nlighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and\r\ncarefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the\r\nkitchen of Bloom’s house.\r\n\r\nWhat did Bloom do?\r\n\r\nHe extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its\r\nflame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for\r\nStephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when\r\nnecessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid\r\nresintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons\r\nof best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs\r\nFlower and M’Donald of 14 D’Olier street, kindled it at three\r\nprojecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby\r\nreleasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its\r\ncarbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen\r\nof the air.\r\n\r\nOf what similar apparitions did Stephen think?\r\n\r\nOf others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two,\r\nhad kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the\r\ncollege of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the\r\ncounty of Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room\r\nof his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of\r\nhis godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss\r\nJulia Morkan at 15 Usher’s Island: of his aunt Sara, wife of Richie\r\n(Richard) Goulding, in the kitchen of their lodgings at 62 Clanbrassil\r\nstreet: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of\r\nnumber twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of\r\nSaint Francis Xavier 1898: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the\r\nphysics’ theatre of university College, 16 Stephen’s Green, north: of\r\nhis sister Dilly (Delia) in his father’s house in Cabra.\r\n\r\nWhat did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from\r\nthe fire towards the opposite wall?\r\n\r\nUnder a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope,\r\nstretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the\r\nchimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs\r\nfolded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of\r\nladies’ grey hose with Lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual\r\nposition clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer\r\nextremities and the third at their point of junction.\r\n\r\nWhat did Bloom see on the range?\r\n\r\nOn the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left\r\n(larger) hob a black iron kettle.\r\n\r\nWhat did Bloom do at the range?\r\n\r\nHe removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron\r\nkettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to\r\nlet it flow.\r\n\r\nDid it flow?\r\n\r\nYes. From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of\r\n2400 million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of\r\nfilter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial\r\nplant cost of £ 5 per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen\r\nof the Downs and Callowhill to the 26 acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a\r\ndistance of 22 statute miles, and thence, through a system of relieving\r\ntanks, by a gradient of 250 feet to the city boundary at Eustace\r\nbridge, upper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth and\r\ndaily supply of 12 1/2 million gallons the water had fallen below the\r\nsill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and\r\nwaterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C. E., on the instructions of\r\nthe waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for\r\npurposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of\r\nrecourse being had to the impotable water of the Grand and Royal canals\r\nas in 1893) particularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding\r\ntheir ration of 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch\r\nmeter, had been convicted of a wastage of 20,000 gallons per night by a\r\nreading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the\r\ncorporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the\r\ndetriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers,\r\nsolvent, sound.\r\n\r\nWhat in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier,\r\nreturning to the range, admire?\r\n\r\nIts universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature\r\nin seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator’s\r\nprojection: its unplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the\r\nPacific exceeding 8000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and\r\nsurface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the\r\nindependence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its\r\nhydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and\r\nspring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the\r\ncircumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial\r\nsignificance: its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the\r\nglobe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all\r\nthe region below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the\r\nmultisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its\r\ncapacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances\r\nincluding millions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow\r\nerosions of peninsulas and islands, its persistent formation of\r\nhomothetic islands, peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its\r\nalluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its\r\nimperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of\r\ncolours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular\r\nramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent\r\noceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents,\r\ngulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in\r\nseaquakes, waterspouts, Artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies,\r\nfreshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers,\r\ncataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts:\r\nits vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs\r\nand latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric\r\ninstruments and exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at\r\nAshtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of\r\nits composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent\r\npart of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the\r\nDead Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies,\r\ninadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing,\r\nquenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as\r\nparadigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain,\r\nsleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms\r\nin loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls\r\nand archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries\r\nand arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its\r\ndocility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric\r\npower stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in\r\ncanals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its\r\npotentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling\r\nfrom level to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic,\r\nphotophobe), numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the\r\nglobe: its ubiquity as constituting 90\r\n% of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine\r\n% marshes,\r\npestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\nHaving set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he\r\nreturn to the stillflowing tap?\r\n\r\nTo wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of\r\nBarrington’s lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered, (bought\r\nthirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh\r\ncold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in\r\na long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.\r\n\r\nWhat reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom’s offer?\r\n\r\nThat he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by\r\nsubmersion in cold water, (his last bath having taken place in the\r\nmonth of October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous\r\nsubstances of glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nWhat impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and\r\nprophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a\r\npreliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with\r\nrapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region\r\nin case of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most\r\nsensitive to cold being the nape, stomach and thenar or sole of foot?\r\n\r\nThe incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.\r\n\r\nWhat additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?\r\n\r\nDietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric\r\nenergy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the\r\nlastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed.\r\n\r\nWhich seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?\r\n\r\nConfidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and\r\nrecuperation.\r\n\r\nWhat concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the\r\nagency of fire?\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of ebullition. Fanned by a constant updraught of\r\nventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was\r\ncommunicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral\r\nmasses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the\r\nfoliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn\r\nderived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat\r\n(radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous\r\nether. Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such combustion,\r\nwas constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of\r\ncalorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated\r\nthrough the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part\r\nreflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the\r\ntemperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in\r\ntemperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal\r\nunits needed to raise 1 pound of water from 50° to 212° Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nWhat announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?\r\n\r\nA double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at\r\nboth sides simultaneously.\r\n\r\nFor what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?\r\n\r\nTo shave himself.\r\n\r\nWhat advantages attended shaving by night?\r\n\r\nA softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from\r\nshave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if\r\nunexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at\r\nincustomary hours: quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a\r\ncleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal\r\nnoises, premonitions and perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a\r\npostman’s double knock, a paper read, reread while lathering,\r\nrelathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, with thought of aught he\r\nsought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving\r\nand a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected\r\nand applied adhered: which was to be done.\r\n\r\nWhy did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise?\r\n\r\nBecause of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine\r\nfeminine passive active hand.\r\n\r\nWhat quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting\r\ninfluence?\r\n\r\nThe operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human\r\nblood even when the end justified the means, preferring, in their\r\nnatural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic\r\nsurgery.\r\n\r\nWhat lay under exposure on the lower, middle and upper shelves of the\r\nkitchen dresser, opened by Bloom?\r\n\r\nOn the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal\r\nbreakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a\r\nmoustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of Crown Derby, four white\r\ngoldrimmed eggcups, an open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly\r\ncopper, and a phial of aromatic (violet) comfits. On the middle shelf a\r\nchipped eggcup containing pepper, a drum of table salt, four\r\nconglomerated black olives in oleaginous paper, an empty pot of\r\nPlumtree’s potted meat, an oval wicker basket bedded with fibre and\r\ncontaining one Jersey pear, a halfempty bottle of William Gilbey and\r\nCo’s white invalid port, half disrobed of its swathe of coralpink\r\ntissue paper, a packet of Epps’s soluble cocoa, five ounces of Anne\r\nLynch’s choice tea at 2/- per lb in a crinkled leadpaper bag, a\r\ncylindrical canister containing the best crystallised lump sugar, two\r\nonions, one, the larger, Spanish, entire, the other, smaller, Irish,\r\nbisected with augmented surface and more redolent, a jar of Irish Model\r\nDairy’s cream, a jug of brown crockery containing a naggin and a\r\nquarter of soured adulterated milk, converted by heat into water,\r\nacidulous serum and semisolidified curds, which added to the quantity\r\nsubtracted for Mr Bloom’s and Mrs Fleming’s breakfasts, made one\r\nimperial pint, the total quantity originally delivered, two cloves, a\r\nhalfpenny and a small dish containing a slice of fresh ribsteak. On the\r\nupper shelf a battery of jamjars (empty) of various sizes and\r\nproveniences.\r\n\r\nWhat attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser?\r\n\r\nFour polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets,\r\nnumbered 8 87, 88 6.\r\n\r\nWhat reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?\r\n\r\nReminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction,\r\npreindicative of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official\r\nand definitive result of which he had read in the _Evening Telegraph_,\r\nlate pink edition, in the cabman’s shelter, at Butt bridge.\r\n\r\nWhere had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected,\r\nbeen received by him?\r\n\r\nIn Bernard Kiernan’s licensed premises 8, 9 and 10 little Britain\r\nstreet: in David Byrne’s licensed premises, 14 Duke street: in\r\nO’Connell street lower, outside Graham Lemon’s when a dark man had\r\nplaced in his hand a throwaway (subsequently thrown away), advertising\r\nElijah, restorer of the church in Zion: in Lincoln place outside the\r\npremises of F. W. Sweny and Co (Limited), dispensing chemists, when,\r\nwhen Frederick M. (Bantam) Lyons had rapidly and successively\r\nrequested, perused and restituted the copy of the current issue of the\r\n_Freeman’s Journal_ and _National Press_ which he had been about to\r\nthrow away (subsequently thrown away), he had proceeded towards the\r\noriental edifice of the Turkish and Warm Baths, 11 Leinster street,\r\nwith the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in\r\nhis arms the secret of the race, graven in the language of prediction.\r\n\r\nWhat qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event\r\nfollowed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the\r\nelectrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by\r\nfailure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding\r\noriginally from a successful interpretation.\r\n\r\nHis mood?\r\n\r\nHe had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he\r\nwas satisfied.\r\n\r\nWhat satisfied him?\r\n\r\nTo have sustained no positive loss. To have brought a positive gain to\r\nothers. Light to the gentiles.\r\n\r\nHow did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?\r\n\r\nHe poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps’s\r\nsoluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed\r\non the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the\r\nprescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity\r\nprescribed.\r\n\r\nWhat supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his\r\nguest?\r\n\r\nRelinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation\r\nCrown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly),\r\nhe substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served\r\nextraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the\r\nviscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion\r\n(Molly).\r\n\r\nWas the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of\r\nhospitality?\r\n\r\nHis attention was directed to them by his host jocosely, and he\r\naccepted them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps’s\r\nmassproduct, the creature cocoa.\r\n\r\nWere there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed,\r\nreserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to\r\ncomplete the act begun?\r\n\r\nThe reparation of a fissure of the length of 1 1/2 inches in the right\r\nside of his guest’s jacket. A gift to his guest of one of the four\r\nlady’s handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nWho drank more quickly?\r\n\r\nBloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation and\r\ntaking, from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a\r\nsteady flow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent’s one,\r\nsix to two, nine to three.\r\n\r\nWhat cerebration accompanied his frequentative act?\r\n\r\nConcluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was\r\nengaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived\r\nfrom literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself\r\nhad applied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the\r\nsolution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life.\r\n\r\nHad he found their solution?\r\n\r\nIn spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages,\r\naided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text,\r\nthe answers not bearing in all points.\r\n\r\nWhat lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him,\r\npotential poet, at the age of 11 in 1877 on the occasion of the\r\noffering of three prizes of 10/-, 5/- and 2/6 respectively for\r\ncompetition by the _Shamrock_, a weekly newspaper?\r\n\r\n An ambition to squint\r\n At my verses in print\r\n Makes me hope that for these you’ll find room.\r\n If you so condescend\r\n Then please place at the end\r\n The name of yours truly, L. Bloom.\r\n\r\nDid he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him?\r\n\r\nName, age, race, creed.\r\n\r\nWhat anagrams had he made on his name in youth?\r\n\r\nLeopold Bloom\r\nEllpodbomool\r\nMolldopeloob\r\nBollopedoom\r\nOld Ollebo, M. P.\r\n\r\nWhat acrostic upon the abbreviation of his first name had he (kinetic\r\npoet) sent to Miss Marion (Molly) Tweedy on the 14 February 1888?\r\n\r\n Poets oft have sung in rhyme\r\n Of music sweet their praise divine.\r\n Let them hymn it nine times nine.\r\n Dearer far than song or wine.\r\n You are mine. The world is mine.\r\n\r\nWhat had prevented him from completing a topical song (music by R. G.\r\nJohnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual, years,\r\nentitled _If Brian Boru could but come back and see old Dublin now_,\r\ncommissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48,\r\n49 South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the\r\nvalley of diamonds, of the second edition (30 January 1893) of the\r\ngrand annual Christmas pantomime _Sinbad the Sailor_ (produced by R.\r\nShelton 26 December 1892, written by Greenleaf Whittier, scenery by\r\nGeorge A. Jackson and Cecil Hicks, costumes by Mrs and Miss Whelan\r\nunder the personal supervision of Mrs Michael Gunn, ballets by Jessie\r\nNoir, harlequinade by Thomas Otto) and sung by Nelly Bouverist,\r\nprincipal girl?\r\n\r\nFirstly, oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest,\r\nthe anticipated diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria (born 1820, acceded\r\n1837) and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market:\r\nsecondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the\r\nquestions of the respective visits of Their Royal Highnesses the duke\r\nand duchess of York (real) and of His Majesty King Brian Boru\r\n(imaginary): thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and\r\nprofessional emulation concerning the recent erections of the Grand\r\nLyric Hall on Burgh Quay and the Theatre Royal in Hawkins street:\r\nfourthly, distraction resultant from compassion for Nelly Bouverist’s\r\nnon-intellectual, non-political, non-topical expression of countenance\r\nand concupiscence caused by Nelly Bouverist’s revelations of white\r\narticles of non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical underclothing\r\nwhile she (Nelly Bouverist) was in the articles: fifthly, the\r\ndifficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous\r\nallusions from _Everybody’s Book of Jokes_ (1000 pages and a laugh in\r\nevery one): sixthly, the rhymes, homophonous and cacophonous,\r\nassociated with the names of the new lord mayor, Daniel Tallon, the new\r\nhigh sheriff, Thomas Pile and the new solicitorgeneral, Dunbar Plunket\r\nBarton.\r\n\r\nWhat relation existed between their ages?\r\n\r\n16 years before in 1888 when Bloom was of Stephen’s present age Stephen\r\nwas 6. 16 years after in 1920 when Stephen would be of Bloom’s present\r\nage Bloom would be 54. In 1936 when Bloom would be 70 and Stephen 54\r\ntheir ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13\r\n1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according\r\nas arbitrary future years were added, for if the proportion existing in\r\n1883 had continued immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then\r\n1904 when Stephen was 22 Bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when Stephen\r\nwould be 38, as Bloom then was, Bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when\r\nStephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 Bloom,\r\nbeing 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714, would have\r\nsurpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age, that of\r\nMethusalah, 969 years, while, if Stephen would continue to live until\r\nhe would attain that age in the year 3072 A.D., Bloom would have been\r\nobliged to have been alive 83,300 years, having been obliged to have\r\nbeen born in the year 81,396 B.C.\r\n\r\nWhat events might nullify these calculations?\r\n\r\nThe cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new\r\nera or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent\r\nextermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable.\r\n\r\nHow many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?\r\n\r\nTwo. The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon’s house, Medina\r\nVilla, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in 1887, in the company of Stephen’s\r\nmother, Stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his\r\nhand in salutation. The second in the coffeeroom of Breslin’s hotel on\r\na rainy Sunday in the January of 1892, in the company of Stephen’s\r\nfather and Stephen’s granduncle, Stephen being then 5 years older.\r\n\r\nDid Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and\r\nafterwards seconded by the father?\r\n\r\nVery gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative\r\ngratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.\r\n\r\nDid their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a\r\nthird connecting link between them?\r\n\r\nMrs Riordan (Dante), a widow of independent means, had resided in the\r\nhouse of Stephen’s parents from 1 September 1888 to 29 December 1891\r\nand had also resided during the years 1892, 1893 and 1894 in the City\r\nArms Hotel owned by Elizabeth O’Dowd of 54 Prussia street where, during\r\nparts of the years 1893 and 1894, she had been a constant informant of\r\nBloom who resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in\r\nthe employment of Joseph Cuffe of 5 Smithfield for the superintendence\r\nof sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nHad he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?\r\n\r\nHe had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow\r\nof independent, if limited, means, in her convalescent bathchair with\r\nslow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North\r\nCircular road opposite Mr Gavin Low’s place of business where she had\r\nremained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular\r\nfieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles\r\nequipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems,\r\nprivate and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from\r\nthe city to the Phoenix Park and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nWhy could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?\r\n\r\nBecause in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of\r\nbossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with\r\ncontinual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds,\r\nvelocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round\r\nand round the rim of a round and round precipitous globe.\r\n\r\nWhat distinct different memories had each of her now eight years\r\ndeceased?\r\n\r\nThe older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her\r\nsuppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient\r\ncatarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the\r\nstatue of the Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for\r\nCharles Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.\r\n\r\nWere there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation\r\nwhich these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the\r\nmore desirable?\r\n\r\nThe indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently\r\nabandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow’s _Physical Strength and How to\r\nObtain It_ which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in\r\nsedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in\r\nfront of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of\r\nmuscles and produce successively a pleasant rigidity, a more pleasant\r\nrelaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.\r\n\r\nHad any special agility been his in earlier youth?\r\n\r\nThough ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full\r\ncircle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High school scholar he had\r\nexcelled in his stable and protracted execution of the half lever\r\nmovement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally\r\ndeveloped abdominal muscles.\r\n\r\nDid either openly allude to their racial difference?\r\n\r\nNeither.\r\n\r\nWhat, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were Bloom’s thoughts\r\nabout Stephen’s thoughts about Bloom and about Stephen’s thoughts about\r\nBloom’s thoughts about Stephen?\r\n\r\nHe thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he\r\nknew that he knew that he was not.\r\n\r\nWhat, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respective\r\nparentages?\r\n\r\nBloom, only born male transubstantial heir of Rudolf Virag\r\n(subsequently Rudolph Bloom) of Szombathely, Vienna, Budapest, Milan,\r\nLondon and Dublin and of Ellen Higgins, second daughter of Julius\r\nHiggins (born Karoly) and Fanny Higgins (born Hegarty). Stephen, eldest\r\nsurviving male consubstantial heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and Dublin\r\nand of Mary, daughter of Richard and Christina Goulding (born Grier).\r\n\r\nHad Bloom and Stephen been baptised, and where and by whom, cleric or\r\nlayman?\r\n\r\nBloom (three times), by the reverend Mr Gilmer Johnston M. A., alone,\r\nin the protestant church of Saint Nicholas Without, Coombe, by James\r\nO’Connor, Philip Gilligan and James Fitzpatrick, together, under a pump\r\nin the village of Swords, and by the reverend Charles Malone C. C., in\r\nthe church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar. Stephen (once) by the\r\nreverend Charles Malone C. C., alone, in the church of the Three\r\nPatrons, Rathgar.\r\n\r\nDid they find their educational careers similar?\r\n\r\nSubstituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively\r\nthrough a dame’s school and the high school. Substituting Bloom for\r\nStephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory,\r\njunior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the\r\nmatriculation, first arts, second arts and arts degree courses of the\r\nroyal university.\r\n\r\nWhy did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the\r\nuniversity of life?\r\n\r\nBecause of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation\r\nhad or had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWhat two temperaments did they individually represent?\r\n\r\nThe scientific. The artistic.\r\n\r\nWhat proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards\r\napplied, rather than towards pure, science?\r\n\r\nCertain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in\r\na state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his\r\nappreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once\r\nrevolutionary, for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting\r\ntelescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water\r\nsiphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump.\r\n\r\nWere these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of\r\nkindergarten?\r\n\r\nYes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard,\r\ncatapults. They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the\r\ntwelve constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature\r\nmechanical orreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical to\r\ncorrespond with zoological biscuits, globemap playing balls,\r\nhistorically costumed dolls.\r\n\r\nWhat also stimulated him in his cogitations?\r\n\r\nThe financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A. James,\r\nthe former by his 1d bazaar at 42 George’s street, south, the latter at\r\nhis 6 1/2d shop and world’s fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at 30\r\nHenry street, admission 2d, children 1d: and the infinite possibilities\r\nhitherto unexploited of the modern art of advertisement if condensed in\r\ntriliteral monoideal symbols, vertically of maximum visibility\r\n(divined), horizontally of maximum legibility (deciphered) and of\r\nmagnetising efficacy to arrest involuntary attention, to interest, to\r\nconvince, to decide.\r\n\r\nSuch as?\r\n\r\nK. 11.

Nannetti, M. P.,\r\nRotunda Ward, 19 Hardwicke street, under the obituary notices and\r\nanniversaries of deceases. The name on the label is Plumtree. A\r\nplumtree in a meatpot, registered trade mark. Beware of imitations.\r\nPeatmot. Trumplee. Moutpat. Plamtroo.\r\n\r\nWhich example did he adduce to induce Stephen to deduce that\r\noriginality, though producing its own reward, does not invariably\r\nconduce to success?\r\n\r\nHis own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart, drawn\r\nby a beast of burden, in which two smartly dressed girls were to be\r\nseated engaged in writing.\r\n\r\nWhat suggested scene was then constructed by Stephen?\r\n\r\nSolitary hotel in mountain pass. Autumn. Twilight. Fire lit. In dark\r\ncorner young man seated. Young woman enters. Restless. Solitary. She\r\nsits. She goes to window. She stands. She sits. Twilight. She thinks.\r\nOn solitary hotel paper she writes. She thinks. She writes. She sighs.\r\nWheels and hoofs. She hurries out. He comes from his dark corner. He\r\nseizes solitary paper. He holds it towards fire. Twilight. He reads.\r\nSolitary.\r\n\r\nWhat?\r\n\r\nIn sloping, upright and backhands: Queen’s Hotel, Queen’s Hotel,\r\nQueen’s Hotel. Queen’s Ho...\r\n\r\nWhat suggested scene was then reconstructed by Bloom?\r\n\r\nThe Queen’s Hotel, Ennis, county Clare, where Rudolph Bloom (Rudolf\r\nVirag) died on the evening of the 27 June 1886, at some hour unstated,\r\nin consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered\r\nin the form of a neuralgic liniment composed of 2 parts of aconite\r\nliniment to 1 of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at 10.20 a.m. on\r\nthe morning of 27 June 1886 at the medical hall of Francis Dennehy, 17\r\nChurch street, Ennis) after having, though not in consequence of\r\nhaving, purchased at 3.15 p.m. on the afternoon of 27 June 1886 a new\r\nboater straw hat, extra smart (after having, though not in consequence\r\nof having, purchased at the hour and in the place aforesaid, the toxin\r\naforesaid), at the general drapery store of James Cullen, 4 Main\r\nstreet, Ennis.\r\n\r\nDid he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or\r\nintuition?\r\n\r\nCoincidence.\r\n\r\nDid he depict the scene verbally for his guest to see?\r\n\r\nHe preferred himself to see another’s face and listen to another’s\r\nwords by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament\r\nrelieved.\r\n\r\nDid he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to\r\nhim, described by the narrator as _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine_ or _The\r\nParable of the Plums_?\r\n\r\nIt, with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by\r\nimplication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms\r\n(e.g. _My Favourite Hero_ or _Procrastination is the Thief of Time_)\r\ncomposed during schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and in\r\nconjunction with the personal equation certain possibilities of\r\nfinancial, social, personal and sexual success, whether specially\r\ncollected and selected as model pedagogic themes (of cent per cent\r\nmerit) for the use of preparatory and junior grade students or\r\ncontributed in printed form, following the precedent of Philip Beaufoy\r\nor Doctor Dick or Heblon’s _Studies in Blue_, to a publication of\r\ncertified circulation and solvency or employed verbally as intellectual\r\nstimulation for sympathetic auditors, tacitly appreciative of\r\nsuccessful narrative and confidently augurative of successful\r\nachievement, during the increasingly longer nights gradually following\r\nthe summer solstice on the day but three following, videlicet, Tuesday,\r\n21 June (S. Aloysius Gonzaga), sunrise 3.33 a.m., sunset 8.29 p.m.\r\n\r\nWhich domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other\r\nfrequently engaged his mind?\r\n\r\nWhat to do with our wives.\r\n\r\nWhat had been his hypothetical singular solutions?\r\n\r\nParlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spilikins, cup and ball,\r\nnap, spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts,\r\nchess or backgammon): embroidery, darning or knitting for the\r\npoliceaided clothing society: musical duets, mandoline and guitar,\r\npiano and flute, guitar and piano: legal scrivenery or envelope\r\naddressing: biweekly visits to variety entertainments: commercial\r\nactivity as pleasantly commanding and pleasingly obeyed mistress\r\nproprietress in a cool dairy shop or warm cigar divan: the clandestine\r\nsatisfaction of erotic irritation in masculine brothels, state\r\ninspected and medically controlled: social visits, at regular\r\ninfrequent prevented intervals and with regular frequent preventive\r\nsuperintendence, to and from female acquaintances of recognised\r\nrespectability in the vicinity: courses of evening instruction\r\nspecially designed to render liberal instruction agreeable.\r\n\r\nWhat instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him\r\nin favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution?\r\n\r\nIn disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper\r\nwith signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and\r\nHebrew characters. She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals\r\nas to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of\r\na city in Canada, Quebec. She understood little of political\r\ncomplications, internal, or balance of power, external. In calculating\r\nthe addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid. After\r\ncompletion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the\r\nimplement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment, exposed to the\r\ncorrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall. Unusual\r\npolysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by\r\nfalse analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), _alias_\r\n(a mendacious person mentioned in sacred scripture).\r\n\r\nWhat compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and\r\nsuch deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things?\r\n\r\nThe false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all\r\nbalances, proved true by construction. The counterbalance of her\r\nproficiency of judgment regarding one person, proved true by\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nHow had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?\r\n\r\nVariously. By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a\r\ncertain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent\r\nknowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other’s\r\nignorant lapse.\r\n\r\nWith what success had he attempted direct instruction?\r\n\r\nShe followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest\r\ncomprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty\r\nremembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated\r\nwith error.\r\n\r\nWhat system had proved more effective?\r\n\r\nIndirect suggestion implicating selfinterest.\r\n\r\nExample?\r\n\r\nShe disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she\r\ndisliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new\r\nhat with rain, she carried umbrella with new hat.\r\n\r\nAccepting the analogy implied in his guest’s parable which examples of\r\npostexilic eminence did he adduce?\r\n\r\nThree seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides,\r\nauthor of _More Nebukim_ (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohn\r\nof such eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn)\r\nthere arose none like Moses (Maimonides).\r\n\r\nWhat statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a fourth\r\nseeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, by\r\nStephen?\r\n\r\nThat the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher,\r\nname uncertain.\r\n\r\nWere other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a\r\nselected or rejected race mentioned?\r\n\r\nFelix Bartholdy Mendelssohn (composer), Baruch Spinoza (philosopher),\r\nMendoza (pugilist), Ferdinand Lassalle (reformer, duellist).\r\n\r\nWhat fragments of verse from the ancient Hebrew and ancient Irish\r\nlanguages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts\r\nby guest to host and by host to guest?\r\n\r\nBy Stephen: _suil, suil, suil arun, suil go siocair agus suil go cuin_\r\n(walk, walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care).\r\n\r\nBy Bloom: _Kifeloch, harimon rakatejch m’baad l’zamatejch_ (thy temple\r\namid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate).\r\n\r\nHow was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages\r\nmade in substantiation of the oral comparison?\r\n\r\nBy juxtaposition. On the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior\r\nliterary style, entituled _Sweets of Sin_ (produced by Bloom and so\r\nmanipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of\r\nthe table) with a pencil (supplied by Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irish\r\ncharacters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn\r\nwrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence\r\nof mem) a substituted qoph, explaining their arithmetical values as\r\nordinal and cardinal numbers, videlicet 3, 1, 4, and 100.\r\n\r\nWas the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the\r\nextinct and the revived, theoretical or practical?\r\n\r\nTheoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence\r\nand syntax and practically excluding vocabulary.\r\n\r\nWhat points of contact existed between these languages and between the\r\npeoples who spoke them?\r\n\r\nThe presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and\r\nservile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been\r\ntaught on the plain of Shinar 242 years after the deluge in the\r\nseminary instituted by Fenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor\r\nof Israel, and ascendant of Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland:\r\ntheir archaeological, genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical,\r\nhomiletic, toponomastic, historical and religious literatures\r\ncomprising the works of rabbis and culdees, Torah, Talmud (Mischna and\r\nGhemara), Massor, Pentateuch, Book of the Dun Cow, Book of Ballymote,\r\nGarland of Howth, Book of Kells: their dispersal, persecution, survival\r\nand revival: the isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical\r\nrites in ghetto (S. Mary’s Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve’s\r\ntavern): the proscription of their national costumes in penal laws and\r\njewish dress acts: the restoration in Chanah David of Zion and the\r\npossibility of Irish political autonomy or devolution.\r\n\r\nWhat anthem did Bloom chant partially in anticipation of that multiple,\r\nethnically irreducible consummation?\r\n\r\n Kolod balejwaw pnimah\r\n Nefesch, jehudi, homijah.\r\n\r\nWhy was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich?\r\n\r\nIn consequence of defective mnemotechnic.\r\n\r\nHow did the chanter compensate for this deficiency?\r\n\r\nBy a periphrastic version of the general text.\r\n\r\nIn what common study did their mutual reflections merge?\r\n\r\nThe increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic\r\nhieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of\r\nmodern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions\r\n(Semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic).\r\n\r\nDid the guest comply with his host’s request?\r\n\r\nDoubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters.\r\n\r\nWhat was Stephen’s auditive sensation?\r\n\r\nHe heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation\r\nof the past.\r\n\r\nWhat was Bloom’s visual sensation?\r\n\r\nHe saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nWhat were Stephen’s and Bloom’s quasisimultaneous volitional\r\nquasisensations of concealed identities?\r\n\r\nVisually, Stephen’s: The traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted by\r\nJohannes Damascenus, Lentulus Romanus and Epiphanius Monachus as\r\nleucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair.\r\n\r\nAuditively, Bloom’s: The traditional accent of the ecstasy of\r\ncatastrophe.\r\n\r\nWhat future careers had been possible for Bloom in the past and with\r\nwhat exemplars?\r\n\r\nIn the church, Roman, Anglican or Nonconformist: exemplars, the very\r\nreverend John Conmee S. J., the reverend T. Salmon, D. D., provost of\r\nTrinity college, Dr Alexander J. Dowie. At the bar, English or Irish:\r\nexemplars, Seymour Bushe, K. C., Rufus Isaacs, K. C. On the stage,\r\nmodern or Shakespearean: exemplars, Charles Wyndham, high comedian,\r\nOsmond Tearle († 1901), exponent of Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nDid the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a\r\nstrange legend on an allied theme?\r\n\r\nReassuringly, their place, where none could hear them talk, being\r\nsecluded, reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolid\r\nresidual sediment of a mechanical mixture, water plus sugar plus cream\r\nplus cocoa, having been consumed.\r\n\r\nRecite the first (major) part of this chanted legend.\r\n\r\n Little Harry Hughes and his schoolfellows all\r\n Went out for to play ball.\r\n And the very first ball little Harry Hughes played\r\n He drove it o’er the jew’s garden wall.\r\n And the very second ball little Harry Hughes played\r\n He broke the jew’s windows all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHow did the son of Rudolph receive this first part?\r\n\r\nWith unmixed feeling. Smiling, a jew, he heard with pleasure and saw\r\nthe unbroken kitchen window.\r\n\r\nRecite the second part (minor) of the legend.\r\n\r\n Then out there came the jew’s daughter\r\n And she all dressed in green.\r\n “Come back, come back, you pretty little boy,\r\n And play your ball again.”\r\n \r\n I can’t come back and I won’t come back\r\n Without my schoolfellows all.\r\n For if my master he did hear\r\n He’d make it a sorry ball.”\r\n\r\n She took him by the lilywhite hand\r\n And led him along the hall\r\n Until she led him to a room\r\n Where none could hear him call.\r\n\r\n She took a penknife out of her pocket\r\n And cut off his little head.\r\n And now he’ll play his ball no more\r\n For he lies among the dead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHow did the father of Millicent receive this second part?\r\n\r\nWith mixed feelings. Unsmiling, he heard and saw with wonder a jew’s\r\ndaughter, all dressed in green.\r\n\r\nCondense Stephen’s commentary.\r\n\r\nOne of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined. Once by\r\ninadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny. It comes when\r\nhe is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of\r\nhope and youth, holds him unresisting. It leads him to a strange\r\nhabitation, to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable,\r\nimmolates him, consenting.\r\n\r\nWhy was the host (victim predestined) sad?\r\n\r\nHe wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him\r\nshould by him not be told.\r\n\r\nWhy was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.\r\n\r\nWhy was the host (secret infidel) silent?\r\n\r\nHe weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the\r\nincitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the\r\npropagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of\r\nopulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of\r\natavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism,\r\nhypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.\r\n\r\nFrom which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not\r\ntotally immune?\r\n\r\nFrom hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his\r\nsleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an\r\nindefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds. From\r\nsomnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled\r\nin the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained its\r\ndestination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain,\r\nsleeping.\r\n\r\nHad this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member\r\nof his family?\r\n\r\nTwice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent\r\n(Milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an\r\nexclamation of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two\r\nfigures in night attire with a vacant mute expression.\r\n\r\nWhat other infantile memories had he of her?\r\n\r\n15 June 1889. A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and\r\nlessen congestion. A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks\r\nher moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons, one, tloo,\r\ntlee: a doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark,\r\nshe had blond ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau,\r\nAustrian army, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British\r\nnavy.\r\n\r\nWhat endemic characteristics were present?\r\n\r\nConversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line\r\nof lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant\r\nintervals to more distant intervals to its most distant intervals.\r\n\r\nWhat memories had he of her adolescence?\r\n\r\nShe relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess. On the duke’s\r\nlawn, entreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to\r\nmake and take away her photographic image (objection not stated). On\r\nthe South Circular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an\r\nindividual of sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and\r\nturned abruptly back (reason of change not stated). On the vigil of the\r\n15th anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county\r\nWestmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year\r\nnot stated).\r\n\r\nDid that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?\r\n\r\nLess than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.\r\n\r\nWhat second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly,\r\nif differently?\r\n\r\nA temporary departure of his cat.\r\n\r\nWhy similarly, why differently?\r\n\r\nSimilarly, because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male\r\n(Mullingar student) or of a healing herb (valerian). Differently,\r\nbecause of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the\r\nhabitation.\r\n\r\nIn other respects were their differences similar?\r\n\r\nIn passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in\r\nunexpectedness.\r\n\r\nAs?\r\n\r\nInasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it\r\nfor her (cf neckarching cat). Moreover, on the free surface of the lake\r\nin Stephen’s green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented\r\nspit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the\r\nconstancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf\r\nmousewatching cat). Again, in order to remember the date, combatants,\r\nissue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a\r\nplait of her hair (cf earwashing cat). Furthermore, silly Milly, she\r\ndreamed of having had an unspoken unremembered conversation with a\r\nhorse whose name had been Joseph to whom (which) she had offered a\r\ntumblerful of lemonade which it (he) had appeared to have accepted (cf\r\nhearthdreaming cat). Hence, in passivity, in economy, in the instinct\r\nof tradition, in unexpectedness, their differences were similar.\r\n\r\nIn what way had he utilised gifts (1) an owl, 2) a clock, given as\r\nmatrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her?\r\n\r\nAs object lessons to explain: 1) the nature and habits of oviparous\r\nanimals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of\r\nvision, the secular process of imbalsamation: 2) the principle of the\r\npendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation\r\nin terms of human or social regulation of the various positions of\r\nclockwise moveable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of\r\nthe recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour when the longer and\r\nthe shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination,\r\n_videlicet_, 5 5/11 minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical\r\nprogression.\r\n\r\nIn what manners did she reciprocate?\r\n\r\nShe remembered: on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to\r\nhim a breakfast moustachecup of imitation Crown Derby porcelain ware.\r\nShe provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had\r\nbeen made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his\r\nnecessities, anticipating his desires. She admired: a natural\r\nphenomenon having been explained by him to her she expressed the\r\nimmediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of\r\nhis science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part.\r\n\r\nWhat proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist,\r\nmake to Stephen, noctambulist?\r\n\r\nTo pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and\r\nFriday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately\r\nabove the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of\r\nhis host and hostess.\r\n\r\nWhat various advantages would or might have resulted from a\r\nprolongation of such an extemporisation?\r\n\r\nFor the guest: security of domicile and seclusion of study. For the\r\nhost: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction. For the\r\nhostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian\r\npronunciation.\r\n\r\nWhy might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a\r\nhostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent\r\neventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew’s\r\ndaughter?\r\n\r\nBecause the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother\r\nthrough daughter.\r\n\r\nTo what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest\r\nreturn a monosyllabic negative answer?\r\n\r\nIf he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at\r\nSydney Parade railway station, 14 October 1903.\r\n\r\nWhat inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the\r\nhost?\r\n\r\nA statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment\r\nof Mrs Mary Dedalus (born Goulding), 26 June 1903, vigil of the\r\nanniversary of the decease of Rudolph Bloom (born Virag).\r\n\r\nWas the proposal of asylum accepted?\r\n\r\nPromptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined.\r\n\r\nWhat exchange of money took place between host and guest?\r\n\r\nThe former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money (£\r\n1-7-0), one pound seven shillings sterling, advanced by the latter to\r\nthe former.\r\n\r\nWhat counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified,\r\ndeclined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed?\r\n\r\nTo inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place the\r\nresidence of the instructed. To inaugurate a course of vocal\r\ninstruction, place the residence of the instructress. To inaugurate a\r\nseries of static, semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues,\r\nplaces the residence of both speakers (if both speakers were resident\r\nin the same place), the _Ship_ hotel and tavern, 6 Lower Abbey street\r\n(W. and E. Connery, proprietors), the National Library of Ireland, 10\r\nKildare street, the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles\r\nstreet, a public garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a\r\nconjunction of two or more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection\r\nof a right line drawn between their residences (if both speakers were\r\nresident in different places).\r\n\r\nWhat rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually\r\nselfexcluding propositions?\r\n\r\nThe irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert\r\nHengler’s circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive\r\nparticoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring\r\nto a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had\r\npublicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his\r\n(the clown’s) papa. The imprevidibility of the future: once in the\r\nsummer of 1898 he (Bloom) had marked a florin (2/-) with three notches\r\non the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and\r\nreceived by J. and T. Davy, family grocers, 1 Charlemont Mall, Grand\r\nCanal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible,\r\ncircuitous or direct, return.\r\n\r\nWas the clown Bloom’s son?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nHad Bloom’s coin returned?\r\n\r\nNever.\r\n\r\nWhy would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?\r\n\r\nBecause at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to\r\namend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and\r\ninternational animosity.\r\n\r\nHe believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible,\r\neliminating these conditions?\r\n\r\nThere remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct\r\nfrom human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of\r\ndestruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of\r\nthe ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and\r\ndeath: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human\r\nfemales extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable\r\naccidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies\r\nand their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital\r\ncriminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make\r\nterror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres\r\nof which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital\r\ngrowth, through convulsions of metamorphosis, from infancy through\r\nmaturity to decay.\r\n\r\nWhy did he desist from speculation?\r\n\r\nBecause it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other\r\nmore acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena\r\nto be removed.\r\n\r\nDid Stephen participate in his dejection?\r\n\r\nHe affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding\r\nsyllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational\r\nreagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon\r\nthe incertitude of the void.\r\n\r\nWas this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?\r\n\r\nNot verbally. Substantially.\r\n\r\nWhat comforted his misapprehension?\r\n\r\nThat as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from\r\nthe unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void.\r\n\r\nIn what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the\r\nexodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation\r\neffected?\r\n\r\nLighted Candle in Stick borne by\r\nBLOOM\r\nDiaconal Hat on Ashplant borne by\r\nSTEPHEN\r\n\r\nWith what intonation _secreto_ of what commemorative psalm?\r\n\r\nThe 113th, _modus peregrinus: In exitu Israël de Egypto: domus Jacob de\r\npopulo barbaro_.\r\n\r\nWhat did each do at the door of egress?\r\n\r\nBloom set the candlestick on the floor. Stephen put the hat on his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nFor what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress?\r\n\r\nFor a cat.\r\n\r\nWhat spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the\r\nguest, emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from\r\nthe rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden?\r\n\r\nThe heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit.\r\n\r\nWith what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his\r\ncompanion of various constellations?\r\n\r\nMeditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in\r\nincipient lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous\r\nscintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an\r\nobserver placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000\r\nft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of\r\nSirius (alpha in Canis Maior) 10 lightyears (57,000,000,000,000 miles)\r\ndistant and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet: of\r\nArcturus: of the precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and\r\nsextuple sun theta and nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could\r\nbe contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova in\r\n1901: of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules: of\r\nthe parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality\r\nevermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote\r\nfutures in comparison with which the years, threescore and ten, of\r\nallotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.\r\n\r\nWere there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?\r\n\r\nOf the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of\r\nthe earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences\r\nconcealed in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives\r\nand mounds, of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the\r\nincalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible\r\nmolecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single\r\npinhead: of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white\r\nbodies, themselves universes of void space constellated with other\r\nbodies, each, in continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies\r\nof which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component\r\nbodies, dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division\r\ntill, if the progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nWhy did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?\r\n\r\nBecause some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of\r\nthe quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a\r\nnumber computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such\r\nmagnitude and of so many places, e.g., the 9th power of the 9th power\r\nof 9, that, the result having been obtained, 33 closely printed volumes\r\nof 1000 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of India paper would\r\nhave to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its\r\nprinted integers of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of\r\nthousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions, hundreds\r\nof millions, billions, the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of\r\nevery series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to\r\nthe utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers.\r\n\r\nDid he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their\r\nsatellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and\r\nmoral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution?\r\n\r\nOf a different order of difficulty. Conscious that the human organism,\r\nnormally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons, when\r\nelevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere\r\nsuffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the\r\nline of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was\r\napproximated from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo,\r\nwhen proposing this problem for solution, he had conjectured as a\r\nworking hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more\r\nadaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might\r\nsubsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian,\r\nNeptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an\r\napogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite\r\ndifferences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would\r\nprobably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to\r\nvanities, to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity.\r\n\r\nAnd the problem of possible redemption?\r\n\r\nThe minor was proved by the major.\r\n\r\nWhich various features of the constellations were in turn considered?\r\n\r\nThe various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white,\r\nyellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy:\r\ntheir magnitudes revealed up to and including the 7th: their positions:\r\nthe waggoner’s star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular\r\ncinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the\r\ninterdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous\r\ndiscoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel,\r\nGalle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes of\r\ndistances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite\r\ncompressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive\r\nand reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin\r\nof meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the\r\nbirth of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric\r\nshowers about the period of the feast of S. Lawrence (martyr, 10\r\nAugust): the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon\r\nin her arms: the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the\r\nappearance of a star (1st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating\r\nby night and day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and\r\namalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the\r\nperiod of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent\r\nneversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (2nd magnitude)\r\nof similar origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and\r\ndisappeared from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about\r\nthe period of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of\r\n(presumably) similar origin which had (effectively or presumably)\r\nappeared in and disappeared from the constellation of Andromeda about\r\nthe period of the birth of Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the\r\nconstellation of Auriga some years after the birth and death of Rudolph\r\nBloom, junior, and in and from other constellations some years before\r\nor after the birth or death of other persons: the attendant phenomena\r\nof eclipses, solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, abatement of\r\nwind, transit of shadow, taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of\r\nnocturnal or crepuscular animals, persistence of infernal light,\r\nobscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of human beings.\r\n\r\nHis (Bloom’s) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and\r\nallowing for possible error?\r\n\r\nThat it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not\r\na heavenman. That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the\r\nknown to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the\r\nsuppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and\r\nof different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in\r\nspace, remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as\r\na present before its probable spectators had entered actual present\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nWas he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?\r\n\r\nIndubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the\r\ndelirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection\r\ninvoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the\r\nsatellite of their planet.\r\n\r\nDid he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological\r\ninfluences upon sublunary disasters?\r\n\r\nIt seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the\r\nnomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to\r\nverifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the\r\nsea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity.\r\n\r\nWhat special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and\r\nwoman?\r\n\r\nHer antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian\r\ngenerations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her\r\nluminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising and\r\nsetting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced\r\ninvariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to\r\ninaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent\r\nwaters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to\r\nrender insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil\r\ninscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant\r\nimplacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm:\r\nthe stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the\r\nadmonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour,\r\nwhen visible: her attraction, when invisible.\r\n\r\nWhat visible luminous sign attracted Bloom’s, who attracted Stephen’s,\r\ngaze?\r\n\r\nIn the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom’s) house the light of a\r\nparaffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller\r\nblind supplied by Frank O’Hara, window blind, curtain pole and\r\nrevolving shutter manufacturer, 16 Aungier street.\r\n\r\nHow did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person, his\r\nwife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?\r\n\r\nWith indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued\r\naffection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\nBoth then were silent?\r\n\r\nSilent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal\r\nflesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces.\r\n\r\nWere they indefinitely inactive?\r\n\r\nAt Stephen’s suggestion, at Bloom’s instigation both, first Stephen,\r\nthen Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs\r\nof micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual\r\ncircumposition, their gazes, first Bloom’s, then Stephen’s, elevated to\r\nthe projected luminous and semiluminous shadow.\r\n\r\nSimilarly?\r\n\r\nThe trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations\r\nwere dissimilar: Bloom’s longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form\r\nof the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter, who in his ultimate\r\nyear at High School (1880) had been capable of attaining the point of\r\ngreatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the\r\ninstitution, 210 scholars: Stephen’s higher, more sibilant, who in the\r\nultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic\r\nconsumption an insistent vesical pressure.\r\n\r\nWhat different problems presented themselves to each concerning the\r\ninvisible audible collateral organ of the other?\r\n\r\nTo Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity,\r\nreactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pilosity.\r\n\r\nTo Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus\r\ncircumcised (1 January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain\r\nfrom unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine\r\nprepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic\r\nchurch, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of\r\nthe fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine\r\nexcrescences as hair and toenails.\r\n\r\nWhat celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?\r\n\r\nA star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament\r\nfrom Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the\r\nTress of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo.\r\n\r\nHow did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal\r\ndeparter?\r\n\r\nBy inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an\r\nunstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and\r\nturning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its\r\nstaple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and\r\nrevealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress.\r\n\r\nHow did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?\r\n\r\nStanding perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its\r\nbase, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and\r\nforming any angle less than the sum of two right angles.\r\n\r\nWhat sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of\r\ntheir (respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?\r\n\r\nThe sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the\r\nbells in the church of Saint George.\r\n\r\nWhat echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?\r\n\r\nBy Stephen:\r\n\r\n Liliata rutilantium. Turma circumdet.\r\n Iubilantium te virginum. Chorus excipiat.\r\n\r\nBy Bloom:\r\n\r\n Heigho, heigho,\r\n Heigho, heigho.\r\n\r\nWhere were the several members of the company which with Bloom that day\r\nat the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south\r\nto Glasnevin in the north?\r\n\r\nMartin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in\r\nbed), Ned Lambert (in bed), Tom Kernan (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed),\r\nJohn Henry Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (in\r\nbed), Paddy Dignam (in the grave).\r\n\r\nAlone, what did Bloom hear?\r\n\r\nThe double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth,\r\nthe double vibration of a jew’s harp in the resonant lane.\r\n\r\nAlone, what did Bloom feel?\r\n\r\nThe cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing\r\npoint or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or Réaumur: the\r\nincipient intimations of proximate dawn.\r\n\r\nOf what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind\r\nhim?\r\n\r\nOf companions now in various manners in different places defunct: Percy\r\nApjohn (killed in action, Modder River), Philip Gilligan (phthisis,\r\nJervis Street hospital), Matthew F. Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin\r\nBay), Philip Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street), Michael Hart\r\n(phthisis, Mater Misericordiae hospital), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy,\r\nSandymount).\r\n\r\nWhat prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?\r\n\r\nThe disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of daybreak, the\r\napparition of a new solar disk.\r\n\r\nHad he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?\r\n\r\nOnce, in 1887, after a protracted performance of charades in the house\r\nof Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of\r\nthe diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the\r\ndirection of Mizrach, the east.\r\n\r\nHe remembered the initial paraphenomena?\r\n\r\nMore active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at\r\nvarious points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer,\r\nthe visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the\r\nfirst golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon.\r\n\r\nDid he remain?\r\n\r\nWith deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering\r\nthe passage, reclosing the door. With brief suspiration he reassumed\r\nthe candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front\r\nroom, hallfloor, and reentered.\r\n\r\nWhat suddenly arrested his ingress?\r\n\r\nThe right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into\r\ncontact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible\r\nfraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in\r\nconsequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered.\r\n\r\nDescribe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of\r\nfurniture.\r\n\r\nA sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite\r\nthe door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an\r\nalteration which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and\r\nwhite checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the\r\ndoor in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard\r\n(a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had\r\nbeen moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but\r\nmore perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved\r\nfrom right and left of the ingleside to the position originally\r\noccupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.\r\n\r\nDescribe them.\r\n\r\nOne: a squat stuffed easychair, with stout arms extended and back\r\nslanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an\r\nirregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply\r\nupholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing\r\ndiscolouration. The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane\r\ncurves, placed directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat\r\nand from seat to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a\r\nbright circle of white plaited rush.\r\n\r\nWhat significances attached to these two chairs?\r\n\r\nSignificances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of\r\ncircumstantial evidence, of testimonial supermanence.\r\n\r\nWhat occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?\r\n\r\nA vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin\r\nsupporting a pair of long yellow ladies’ gloves and an emerald ashtray\r\ncontaining four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two\r\ndiscoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in\r\nthe key of G natural for voice and piano of _Love’s Old Sweet Song_\r\n(words by G. Clifton Bingham, composed by J. L. Molloy, sung by Madam\r\nAntoinette Sterling) open at the last page with the final indications\r\n_ad libitum, forte_, pedal, _animato_, sustained pedal, _ritirando_,\r\nclose.\r\n\r\nWith what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?\r\n\r\nWith strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right\r\ntemple a contused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on a\r\nlarge dull passive and a slender bright active: with solicitation,\r\nbending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement,\r\nremembering Dr Malachi Mulligan’s scheme of colour containing the\r\ngradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent\r\nact and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the\r\nconsequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual\r\ndiscolouration.\r\n\r\nHis next proceeding?\r\n\r\nFrom an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black\r\ndiminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on\r\na small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the\r\nmantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus\r\n(illustrated) entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same, examined it\r\nsuperficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the\r\ncandleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the\r\nlatter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin\r\nof the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to\r\nfacilitate total combustion.\r\n\r\nWhat followed this operation?\r\n\r\nThe truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a\r\nvertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense.\r\n\r\nWhat homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the\r\nmantelpiece?\r\n\r\nA timepiece of striated Connemara marble, stopped at the hour of 4.46\r\na.m. on the 21 March 1896, matrimonial gift of Matthew Dillon: a dwarf\r\ntree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade, matrimonial\r\ngift of Luke and Caroline Doyle: an embalmed owl, matrimonial gift of\r\nAlderman John Hooper.\r\n\r\nWhat interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and\r\nBloom?\r\n\r\nIn the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the\r\ndwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl. Before the\r\nmirror the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear\r\nmelancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom\r\nwhile Bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated\r\ngaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle.\r\n\r\nWhat composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his\r\nattention?\r\n\r\nThe image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man.\r\n\r\nWhy solitary (ipsorelative)?\r\n\r\n Brothers and sisters had he none.\r\n Yet that man’s father was his grandfather’s son.\r\n\r\nWhy mutable (aliorelative)?\r\n\r\nFrom infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix.\r\nFrom maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal\r\nprocreator.\r\n\r\nWhat final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror?\r\n\r\nThe optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged\r\nand not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles\r\non the two bookshelves opposite.\r\n\r\nCatalogue these books.\r\n\r\n_Thom’s Dublin Post Office Directory_, 1886.\r\n\r\nDenis Florence M’Carthy’s _Poetical Works_ (copper beechleaf bookmark\r\nat p. 5).\r\n\r\nShakespeare’s _Works_ (dark crimson morocco, goldtooled).\r\n\r\n_The Useful Ready Reckoner_ (brown cloth).\r\n\r\n_The Secret History of the Court of Charles II_ (red cloth, tooled\r\nbinding).\r\n\r\n_The Child’s Guide_ (blue cloth).\r\n\r\n_The Beauties of Killarney_ (wrappers).\r\n\r\n_When We Were Boys_ by William O’Brien M.

A. Wren, 9 Bachelor’s Walk.\r\n\r\nWhat caused him irritation in his sitting posture?\r\n\r\nInhibitory pressure of collar (size 17) and waistcoat (5 buttons), two\r\narticles of clothing superfluous in the costume of mature males and\r\ninelastic to alterations of mass by expansion.\r\n\r\nHow was the irritation allayed?\r\n\r\nHe removed his collar, with contained black necktie and collapsible\r\nstud, from his neck to a position on the left of the table. He\r\nunbuttoned successively in reversed direction waistcoat, trousers,\r\nshirt and vest along the medial line of irregular incrispated black\r\nhairs extending in triangular convergence from the pelvic basin over\r\nthe circumference of the abdomen and umbilicular fossicle along the\r\nmedial line of nodes to the intersection of the sixth pectoral\r\nvertebrae, thence produced both ways at right angles and terminating in\r\ncircles described about two equidistant points, right and left, on the\r\nsummits of the mammary prominences. He unbraced successively each of\r\nsix minus one braced trouser buttons, arranged in pairs, of which one\r\nincomplete.\r\n\r\nWhat involuntary actions followed?\r\n\r\nHe compressed between 2 fingers the flesh circumjacent to a cicatrice\r\nin the left infracostal region below the diaphragm resulting from a\r\nsting inflicted 2 weeks and 3 days previously (23 May 1904) by a bee.\r\nHe scratched imprecisely with his right hand, though insensible of\r\nprurition, various points and surfaces of his partly exposed, wholly\r\nabluted skin. He inserted his left hand into the left lower pocket of\r\nhis waistcoat and extracted and replaced a silver coin (1 shilling),\r\nplaced there (presumably) on the occasion (17 October 1903) of the\r\ninterment of Mrs Emily Sinico, Sydney Parade.\r\n\r\nCompile the budget for 16 June 1904.\r\n\r\n Debit\r\n £. s. d.\r\n 1 Pork kidney 0—0—3\r\n 1 Copy Freeman’s Journal 0—0—1\r\n 1 Bath and Gratification 0—1—6\r\n Tramfare 0—0—1\r\n 1 In Memoriam Patrick Dignam 0—5—0\r\n 2 Banbury cakes 0—0—1\r\n 1 Lunch 0—0—7\r\n 1 Renewal fee for book 0—1—0\r\n 1 Packet Notepaper and Envelopes 0—0—2\r\n 1 Dinner and Gratification 0—2—0\r\n 1 Postal Order and Stamp 0—2—8\r\n Tramfare 0—0—1\r\n 1 Pig’s Foot 0—0—4\r\n 1 Sheep’s Trotter 0—0—3\r\n 1 Cake Fry’s Plain Chocolate 0—0—1\r\n 1 Square Soda Bread 0—0—4\r\n 1 Coffee and Bun 0—0—4\r\n Loan (Stephen Dedalus) refunded 1—7—0\r\n BALANCE 0—16—6\r\n —————\r\n 2—19—3\r\n Credit\r\n £. s. d.\r\n Cash in hand 0—4—9\r\n Commission recd.

persistent ache in his footsoles he extended\r\nhis foot to one side and observed the creases, protuberances and\r\nsalient points caused by foot pressure in the course of walking\r\nrepeatedly in several different directions, then, inclined, he disnoded\r\nthe laceknots, unhooked and loosened the laces, took off each of his\r\ntwo boots for the second time, detached the partially moistened right\r\nsock through the fore part of which the nail of his great toe had again\r\neffracted, raised his right foot and, having unhooked a purple elastic\r\nsock suspender, took off his right sock, placed his unclothed right\r\nfoot on the margin of the seat of his chair, picked at and gently\r\nlacerated the protruding part of the great toenail, raised the part\r\nlacerated to his nostrils and inhaled the odour of the quick, then,\r\nwith satisfaction, threw away the lacerated ungual fragment.\r\n\r\nWhy with satisfaction?\r\n\r\nBecause the odour inhaled corresponded to other odours inhaled of other\r\nungual fragments, picked and lacerated by Master Bloom, pupil of Mrs\r\nEllis’s juvenile school, patiently each night in the act of brief\r\ngenuflection and nocturnal prayer and ambitious meditation.\r\n\r\nIn what ultimate ambition had all concurrent and consecutive ambitions\r\nnow coalesced?\r\n\r\nNot to inherit by right of primogeniture, gavelkind or borough English,\r\nor possess in perpetuity an extensive demesne of a sufficient number of\r\nacres, roods and perches, statute land measure (valuation £ 42), of\r\ngrazing turbary surrounding a baronial

Saint Leopold’s. Flowerville.\r\n\r\nCould Bloom of 7 Eccles street foresee Bloom of Flowerville?\r\n\r\nIn loose allwool garments with Harris tweed cap, price 8/6, and useful\r\ngarden boots with elastic gussets and wateringcan, planting aligned\r\nyoung firtrees, syringing, pruning, staking, sowing hayseed, trundling\r\na weedladen wheelbarrow without excessive fatigue at sunset amid the\r\nscent of newmown hay, ameliorating the soil, multiplying wisdom,\r\nachieving longevity.\r\n\r\nWhat syllabus of intellectual pursuits was simultaneously possible?\r\n\r\nSnapshot photography, comparative study of religions, folklore relative\r\nto various amatory and superstitious practices, contemplation of the\r\ncelestial constellations.\r\n\r\nWhat lighter recreations?\r\n\r\nOutdoor: garden and fieldwork, cycling on level macadamised causeways,\r\nascents of moderately high hills, natation in secluded fresh water and\r\nunmolested river boating in secure wherry or light curricle with kedge\r\nanchor on reaches free from weirs and rapids (period of estivation),\r\nvespertinal perambulation or equestrian circumprocession with\r\ninspection of sterile landscape and contrastingly agreeable cottagers’\r\nfires of smoking peat turves (period of hibernation). Indoor:\r\ndiscussion in tepid security of unsolved historical and criminal\r\nproblems: lecture of unexpurgated exotic erotic masterpieces: house\r\ncarpentry with toolbox containing hammer, awl, nails, screws, tintacks,\r\ngimlet, tweezers, bullnose plane and turnscrew.\r\n\r\nMight he become a gentleman farmer of field produce and live stock?\r\n\r\nNot impossibly, with 1 or 2 stripper cows, 1 pike of upland hay and\r\nrequisite farming implements, e.g., an end-to-end churn, a turnip\r\npulper etc.\r\n\r\nWhat would be his civic functions and social status among the county\r\nfamilies and landed gentry?\r\n\r\nArranged successively in ascending powers of hierarchical order, that\r\nof gardener, groundsman, cultivator, breeder, and at the zenith of his\r\ncareer, resident magistrate or justice of the peace with a family crest\r\nand coat of arms and appropriate classical motto _(Semper paratus_),\r\nduly recorded in the court directory (Bloom, Leopold P., M. P., P. C.,\r\nK. P., L. L. D. (_honoris causa_), Bloomville, Dundrum) and mentioned\r\nin court and fashionable intelligence (Mr and Mrs Leopold Bloom have\r\nleft Kingstown for England).\r\n\r\nWhat course of action did he outline for himself in such capacity?\r\n\r\nA course that lay between undue clemency and excessive rigour: the\r\ndispensation in a heterogeneous society of arbitrary classes,\r\nincessantly rearranged in terms of greater and lesser social\r\ninequality, of unbiassed homogeneous indisputable justice, tempered\r\nwith mitigants of the widest possible latitude but exactable to the\r\nuttermost farthing with confiscation of estate, real and personal, to\r\nthe crown. Loyal to the highest constituted power in the land, actuated\r\nby an innate love of rectitude his aims would be the strict maintenance\r\nof public order, the repression of many abuses though not of all\r\nsimultaneously (every measure of reform or retrenchment being a\r\npreliminary solution to be contained by fluxion in the final solution),\r\nthe upholding of the letter of the law (common, statute and law\r\nmerchant) against all traversers in covin and trespassers acting in\r\ncontravention of bylaws and regulations, all resuscitators (by trespass\r\nand petty larceny of kindlings) of venville rights, obsolete by\r\ndesuetude, all orotund instigators of international persecution, all\r\nperpetuators of international animosities, all menial molestors of\r\ndomestic conviviality, all recalcitrant violators of domestic\r\nconnubiality.\r\n\r\nProve that he had loved rectitude from his earliest youth.\r\n\r\nTo Master Percy Apjohn at High School in 1880 he had divulged his\r\ndisbelief in the tenets of the Irish (protestant) church (to which his\r\nfather Rudolf Virag (later Rudolph Bloom) had been converted from the\r\nIsraelitic faith and communion in 1865 by the Society for promoting\r\nChristianity among the jews) subsequently abjured by him in favour of\r\nRoman catholicism at the epoch of and with a view to his matrimony in\r\n1888. To Daniel Magrane and Francis Wade in 1882 during a juvenile\r\nfriendship (terminated by the premature emigration of the former) he\r\nhad advocated during nocturnal perambulations the political theory of\r\ncolonial (e.g. Canadian) expansion and the evolutionary theories of\r\nCharles Darwin, expounded in _The Descent of Man_ and _The Origin of\r\nSpecies_. In 1885 he had publicly expressed his adherence to the\r\ncollective and national economic programme advocated by James Fintan\r\nLalor, John Fisher Murray, John Mitchel, J. F. X.

B.)\r\nfrom Martha Clifford (find M. C.).\r\n\r\nWhat pleasant reflection accompanied this action?\r\n\r\nThe reflection that, apart from the letter in question, his magnetic\r\nface, form and address had been favourably received during the course\r\nof the preceding day by a wife (Mrs Josephine Breen, born Josie\r\nPowell), a nurse, Miss Callan (Christian name unknown), a maid,\r\nGertrude (Gerty, family name unknown).\r\n\r\nWhat possibility suggested itself?\r\n\r\nThe possibility of exercising virile power of fascination in the not\r\nimmediate future after an expensive repast in a private apartment in\r\nthe company of an elegant courtesan, of corporal beauty, moderately\r\nmercenary, variously instructed, a lady by origin.\r\n\r\nWhat did the 2nd drawer contain?\r\n\r\nDocuments: the birth certificate of Leopold Paula Bloom: an endowment\r\nassurance policy of £ 500 in the Scottish Widows’ Assurance Society,\r\nintestated Millicent (Milly) Bloom, coming into force at 25 years as\r\nwith profit policy of £ 430, £ 462-10-0 and £ 500 at 60 years or death,\r\n65 years or death and death, respectively, or with profit policy\r\n(paidup) of £ 299-10-0 together with cash payment of £ 133-10-0, at\r\noption: a bank passbook issued by the Ulster Bank, College Green branch\r\nshowing statement of a/c for halfyear ending 31 December 1903, balance\r\nin depositor’s favour: £ 18-14-6 (eighteen pounds, fourteen shillings\r\nand sixpence, sterling), net personalty: certificate of possession of £\r\n900, Canadian 4% (inscribed) government stock (free of stamp duty):\r\ndockets of the Catholic Cemeteries’ (Glasnevin) Committee, relative to\r\na graveplot purchased: a local press cutting concerning change of name\r\nby deedpoll.\r\n\r\nQuote the textual terms of this notice.\r\n\r\nI, Rudolph Virag, now resident at no 52 Clanbrassil street, Dublin,\r\nformerly of Szombathely in the kingdom of Hungary, hereby give notice\r\nthat I have assumed and intend henceforth upon all occasions and at all\r\ntimes to be known by the name of Rudolph Bloom.\r\n\r\nWhat other objects relative to Rudolph Bloom (born Virag) were in the\r\n2nd drawer?\r\n\r\nAn indistinct daguerreotype of Rudolf Virag and his father Leopold\r\nVirag executed in the year 1852 in the portrait atelier of their\r\n(respectively) 1st and 2nd cousin, Stefan Virag of Szesfehervar,\r\nHungary. An ancient haggadah book in which a pair of hornrimmed convex\r\nspectacles inserted marked the passage of thanksgiving in the ritual\r\nprayers for Pessach (Passover): a photocard of the Queen’s Hotel,\r\nEnnis, proprietor, Rudolph Bloom: an envelope addressed: _To My Dear\r\nSon Leopold_.\r\n\r\nWhat fractions of phrases did the lecture of those five whole words\r\nevoke?\r\n\r\nTomorrow will be a week that I received... it is no use Leopold to be\r\n... with your dear mother... that is not more to stand... to her... all\r\nfor me is out... be kind to Athos, Leopold... my dear son... always...\r\nof me... _das Herz... Gott... dein_...\r\n\r\nWhat reminiscences of a human subject suffering from progressive\r\nmelancholia did these objects evoke in Bloom?\r\n\r\nAn old man, widower, unkempt of hair, in bed, with head covered,\r\nsighing: an infirm dog, Athos: aconite, resorted to by increasing doses\r\nof grains and scruples as a palliative of recrudescent neuralgia: the\r\nface in death of a septuagenarian, suicide by poison.\r\n\r\nWhy did Bloom experience a sentiment of remorse?\r\n\r\nBecause in immature impatience he had treated with disrespect certain\r\nbeliefs and practices.\r\n\r\nAs?\r\n\r\nThe prohibition of the use of fleshmeat and milk at one meal: the\r\nhebdomadary symposium of incoordinately abstract, perfervidly concrete\r\nmercantile coexreligionist excompatriots: the circumcision of male\r\ninfants: the supernatural character of Judaic scripture: the\r\nineffability of the tetragrammaton: the sanctity of the sabbath.\r\n\r\nHow did these beliefs and practices now appear to him?\r\n\r\nNot more rational than they had then appeared, not less rational than\r\nother beliefs and practices now appeared.\r\n\r\nWhat first reminiscence had he of Rudolph Bloom (deceased)?\r\n\r\nRudolph Bloom (deceased) narrated to his son Leopold Bloom (aged 6) a\r\nretrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and between\r\nDublin, London, Florence, Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Szombathely with\r\nstatements of satisfaction (his grandfather having seen Maria Theresia,\r\nempress of Austria, queen of Hungary), with commercial advice (having\r\ntaken care of pence, the pounds having taken care of themselves).\r\nLeopold Bloom (aged 6) had accompanied these narrations by constant\r\nconsultation of a geographical map of Europe (political) and by\r\nsuggestions for the establishment of affiliated business premises in\r\nthe various centres mentioned.\r\n\r\nHad time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these\r\nmigrations in narrator and listener?\r\n\r\nIn narrator by the access of years and in consequence of the use of\r\nnarcotic toxin: in listener by the access of years and in consequence\r\nof the action of distraction upon vicarious experiences.\r\n\r\nWhat idiosyncracies of the narrator were concomitant products of\r\namnesia?\r\n\r\nOccasionally he ate without having previously removed his hat.\r\nOccasionally he drank voraciously the juice of gooseberry fool from an\r\ninclined plate. Occasionally he removed from his lips the traces of\r\nfood by means of a lacerated envelope or other accessible fragment of\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nWhat two phenomena of senescence were more frequent?\r\n\r\nThe myopic digital calculation of coins, eructation consequent upon\r\nrepletion.\r\n\r\nWhat object offered partial consolation for these reminiscences?\r\n\r\nThe endowment policy, the bank passbook, the certificate of the\r\npossession of scrip.\r\n\r\nReduce Bloom by cross multiplication of reverses of fortune, from which\r\nthese supports protected him, and by elimination of all positive values\r\nto a negligible negative irrational unreal quantity.\r\n\r\nSuccessively, in descending helotic order: Poverty: that of the outdoor\r\nhawker of imitation jewellery, the dun for the recovery of bad and\r\ndoubtful debts, the poor rate and deputy cess collector. Mendicancy:\r\nthat of the fraudulent bankrupt with negligible assets paying 1/4d in\r\nthe £, sandwichman, distributor of throwaways, nocturnal vagrant,\r\ninsinuating sycophant, maimed sailor, blind stripling, superannuated\r\nbailiff’s man, marfeast, lickplate, spoilsport, pickthank, eccentric\r\npublic laughingstock seated on bench of public park under discarded\r\nperforated umbrella. Destitution: the inmate of Old Man’s House (Royal\r\nHospital), Kilmainham, the inmate of Simpson’s Hospital for reduced but\r\nrespectable men permanently disabled by gout or want of sight. Nadir of\r\nmisery: the aged impotent disfranchised ratesupported moribund lunatic\r\npauper.\r\n\r\nWith which attendant indignities?\r\n\r\nThe unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females, the\r\ncontempt of muscular males, the acceptance of fragments of bread, the\r\nsimulated ignorance of casual acquaintances, the latration of\r\nillegitimate unlicensed vagabond dogs, the infantile discharge of\r\ndecomposed vegetable missiles, worth little or nothing, nothing or less\r\nthan nothing.\r\n\r\nBy what could such a situation be precluded?\r\n\r\nBy decease (change of state): by departure (change of place).\r\n\r\nWhich preferably?\r\n\r\nThe latter, by the line of least resistance.\r\n\r\nWhat considerations rendered departure not entirely undesirable?\r\n\r\nConstant cohabitation impeding mutual toleration of personal defects.\r\nThe habit of independent purchase increasingly cultivated. The\r\nnecessity to counteract by impermanent sojourn the permanence of\r\narrest.\r\n\r\nWhat considerations rendered departure not irrational?\r\n\r\nThe parties concerned, uniting, had increased and multiplied, which\r\nbeing done, offspring produced and educed to maturity, the parties, if\r\nnot disunited were obliged to reunite for increase and multiplication,\r\nwhich was absurd, to form by reunion the original couple of uniting\r\nparties, which was impossible.\r\n\r\nWhat considerations rendered departure desirable?\r\n\r\nThe attractive character of certain localities in Ireland and abroad,\r\nas represented in general geographical maps of polychrome design or in\r\nspecial ordnance survey charts by employment of scale numerals and\r\nhachures.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland?\r\n\r\nThe cliffs of Moher, the windy wilds of Connemara, lough Neagh with\r\nsubmerged petrified city, the Giant’s Causeway, Fort Camden and Fort\r\nCarlisle, the Golden Vale of Tipperary, the islands of Aran, the\r\npastures of royal Meath, Brigid’s elm in Kildare, the Queen’s Island\r\nshipyard in Belfast, the Salmon Leap, the lakes of Killarney.\r\n\r\nAbroad?\r\n\r\nCeylon (with spicegardens supplying tea to Thomas Kernan, agent for\r\nPulbrook, Robertson and Co, 2 Mincing Lane, London, E. C., 5 Dame\r\nstreet, Dublin), Jerusalem, the holy city (with mosque of Omar and gate\r\nof Damascus, goal of aspiration), the straits of Gibraltar (the unique\r\nbirthplace of Marion Tweedy), the Parthenon (containing statues of nude\r\nGrecian divinities), the Wall street money market (which controlled\r\ninternational finance), the Plaza de Toros at La Linea, Spain (where\r\nO’Hara of the Camerons had slain the bull), Niagara (over which no\r\nhuman being had passed with impunity), the land of the Eskimos (eaters\r\nof soap), the forbidden country of Thibet (from which no traveller\r\nreturns), the bay of Naples (to see which was to die), the Dead Sea.\r\n\r\nUnder what guidance, following what signs?\r\n\r\nAt sea, septentrional, by night the polestar, located at the point of\r\nintersection of the right line from beta to alpha in Ursa Maior\r\nproduced and divided externally at omega and the hypotenuse of the\r\nrightangled triangle formed by the line alpha omega so produced and the\r\nline alpha delta of Ursa Maior. On land, meridional, a bispherical\r\nmoon, revealed in imperfect varying phases of lunation through the\r\nposterior interstice of the imperfectly occluded skirt of a carnose\r\nnegligent perambulating female, a pillar of the cloud by day.\r\n\r\nWhat public advertisement would divulge the occultation of the\r\ndeparted?\r\n\r\n£ 5 reward, lost, stolen or strayed from his residence 7 Eccles street,\r\nmissing gent about 40, answering to the name of Bloom, Leopold (Poldy),\r\nheight 5 ft 9 1/2 inches, full build, olive complexion, may have since\r\ngrown a beard, when last seen was wearing a black suit. Above sum will\r\nbe paid for information leading to his discovery.\r\n\r\nWhat universal binomial denominations would be his as entity and\r\nnonentity?\r\n\r\nAssumed by any or known to none. Everyman or Noman.\r\n\r\nWhat tributes his?\r\n\r\nHonour and gifts of strangers, the friends of Everyman. A nymph\r\nimmortal, beauty, the bride of Noman.\r\n\r\nWould the departed never nowhere nohow reappear?\r\n\r\nEver he would wander, selfcompelled, to the extreme limit of his\r\ncometary orbit, beyond the fixed stars and variable suns and telescopic\r\nplanets, astronomical waifs and strays, to the extreme boundary of\r\nspace, passing from land to land, among peoples, amid events. Somewhere\r\nimperceptibly he would hear and somehow reluctantly, suncompelled, obey\r\nthe summons of recall. Whence, disappearing from the constellation of\r\nthe Northern Crown he would somehow reappear reborn above delta in the\r\nconstellation of Cassiopeia and after incalculable eons of\r\nperegrination return an estranged avenger, a wreaker of justice on\r\nmalefactors, a dark crusader, a sleeper awakened, with financial\r\nresources (by supposition) surpassing those of Rothschild or the silver\r\nking.\r\n\r\nWhat would render such return irrational?\r\n\r\nAn unsatisfactory equation between an exodus and return in time through\r\nreversible space and an exodus and return in space through irreversible\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nWhat play of forces, inducing inertia, rendered departure undesirable?\r\n\r\nThe lateness of the hour, rendering procrastinatory: the obscurity of\r\nthe night, rendering invisible: the uncertainty of thoroughfares,\r\nrendering perilous: the necessity for repose, obviating movement: the\r\nproximity of an occupied bed, obviating research: the anticipation of\r\nwarmth (human) tempered with coolness (linen), obviating desire and\r\nrendering desirable: the statue of Narcissus, sound without echo,\r\ndesired desire.\r\n\r\nWhat advantages were possessed by an occupied, as distinct from an\r\nunoccupied bed?\r\n\r\nThe removal of nocturnal solitude, the superior quality of human\r\n(mature female) to inhuman (hotwaterjar) calefaction, the stimulation\r\nof matutinal contact, the economy of mangling done on the premises in\r\nthe case of trousers accurately folded and placed lengthwise between\r\nthe spring mattress (striped) and the woollen mattress (biscuit\r\nsection).\r\n\r\nWhat past consecutive causes, before rising preapprehended, of\r\naccumulated fatigue did Bloom, before rising, silently recapitulate?\r\n\r\nThe preparation of breakfast (burnt offering): intestinal congestion\r\nand premeditative defecation (holy of holies): the bath (rite of John):\r\nthe funeral (rite of Samuel): the advertisement of Alexander Keyes\r\n(Urim and Thummim): the unsubstantial lunch (rite of Melchisedek): the\r\nvisit to museum and national library (holy place): the bookhunt along\r\nBedford row, Merchants’ Arch, Wellington Quay (Simchath Torah): the\r\nmusic in the Ormond Hotel (Shira Shirim): the altercation with a\r\ntruculent troglodyte in Bernard Kiernan’s premises (holocaust): a blank\r\nperiod of time including a cardrive, a visit to a house of mourning, a\r\nleavetaking (wilderness): the eroticism produced by feminine\r\nexhibitionism (rite of Onan): the prolonged delivery of Mrs Mina\r\nPurefoy (heave offering): the visit to the disorderly house of Mrs\r\nBella Cohen, 82 Tyrone street, lower, and subsequent brawl and chance\r\nmedley in Beaver street (Armageddon): nocturnal perambulation to and\r\nfrom the cabman’s shelter, Butt Bridge (atonement).\r\n\r\nWhat selfimposed enigma did Bloom about to rise in order to go so as to\r\nconclude lest he should not conclude involuntarily apprehend?\r\n\r\nThe cause of a brief sharp unforeseen heard loud lone crack emitted by\r\nthe insentient material of a strainveined timber table.\r\n\r\nWhat selfinvolved enigma did Bloom risen, going, gathering\r\nmulticoloured multiform multitudinous garments, voluntarily\r\napprehending, not comprehend?\r\n\r\nWho was M’Intosh?\r\n\r\nWhat selfevident enigma pondered with desultory constancy during 30\r\nyears did Bloom now, having effected natural obscurity by the\r\nextinction of artificial light, silently suddenly comprehend?\r\n\r\nWhere was Moses when the candle went out?\r\n\r\nWhat imperfections in a perfect day did Bloom, walking, charged with\r\ncollected articles of recently disvested male wearing apparel,\r\nsilently, successively, enumerate?\r\n\r\nA provisional failure to obtain renewal of an advertisement: to obtain\r\na certain quantity of tea from Thomas Kernan (agent for Pulbrook,\r\nRobertson and Co, 5 Dame Street, Dublin, and 2 Mincing Lane, London E.\r\nC.): to certify the presence or absence of posterior rectal orifice in\r\nthe case of Hellenic female divinities: to obtain admission (gratuitous\r\nor paid) to the performance of _Leah_ by Mrs Bandmann Palmer at the\r\nGaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street.\r\n\r\nWhat impression of an absent face did Bloom, arrested, silently recall?\r\n\r\nThe face of her father, the late Major Brian Cooper Tweedy, Royal\r\nDublin Fusiliers, of Gibraltar and Rehoboth, Dolphin’s Barn.\r\n\r\nWhat recurrent impressions of the same were possible by hypothesis?\r\n\r\nRetreating, at the terminus of the Great Northern Railway, Amiens\r\nstreet, with constant uniform acceleration, along parallel lines\r\nmeeting at infinity, if produced: along parallel lines, reproduced from\r\ninfinity, with constant uniform retardation, at the terminus of the\r\nGreat Northern Railway, Amiens street, returning.\r\n\r\nWhat miscellaneous effects of female personal wearing apparel were\r\nperceived by him?\r\n\r\nA pair of new inodorous halfsilk black ladies’ hose, a pair of new\r\nviolet garters, a pair of outsize ladies’ drawers of India mull, cut on\r\ngenerous lines, redolent of opoponax, jessamine and Muratti’s Turkish\r\ncigarettes and containing a long bright steel safety pin, folded\r\ncurvilinear, a camisole of batiste with thin lace border, an accordion\r\nunderskirt of blue silk moirette, all these objects being disposed\r\nirregularly on the top of a rectangular trunk, quadruple battened,\r\nhaving capped corners, with multicoloured labels, initialled on its\r\nfore side in white lettering B. C. T. (Brian Cooper Tweedy).\r\n\r\nWhat impersonal objects were perceived?\r\n\r\nA commode, one leg fractured, totally covered by square cretonne\r\ncutting, apple design, on which rested a lady’s black straw hat.\r\nOrangekeyed ware, bought of Henry Price, basket, fancy goods, chinaware\r\nand ironmongery manufacturer, 21, 22, 23 Moore street, disposed\r\nirregularly on the washstand and floor and consisting of basin,\r\nsoapdish and brushtray (on the washstand, together), pitcher and night\r\narticle (on the floor, separate).\r\n\r\nBloom’s acts?\r\n\r\nHe deposited the articles of clothing on a chair, removed his remaining\r\narticles of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the\r\nbed a folded long white nightshirt, inserted his head and arms into the\r\nproper apertures of the nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to\r\nthe foot of the bed, prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nHow?\r\n\r\nWith circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or\r\nnot his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress\r\nbeing old, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous\r\nunder stress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of\r\nlust or adders: lightly, the less to disturb: reverently, the bed of\r\nconception and of birth, of consummation of marriage and of breach of\r\nmarriage, of sleep and of death.\r\n\r\nWhat did his limbs, when gradually extended, encounter?\r\n\r\nNew clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form,\r\nfemale, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs,\r\nsome flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed.\r\n\r\nIf he had smiled why would he have smiled?\r\n\r\nTo reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to\r\nenter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if\r\nthe first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first,\r\nlast, only and alone whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor\r\nalone in a series originating in and repeated to infinity.\r\n\r\nWhat preceding series?\r\n\r\nAssuming Mulvey to be the first term of his series, Penrose, Bartell\r\nd’Arcy, professor Goodwin, Julius Mastiansky, John Henry Menton, Father\r\nBernard Corrigan, a farmer at the Royal Dublin Society’s Horse Show,\r\nMaggot O’Reilly, Matthew Dillon, Valentine Blake Dillon (Lord Mayor of\r\nDublin), Christopher Callinan, Lenehan, an Italian organgrinder, an\r\nunknown gentleman in the Gaiety Theatre, Benjamin Dollard, Simon\r\nDedalus, Andrew (Pisser) Burke, Joseph Cuffe, Wisdom Hely, Alderman\r\nJohn Hooper, Dr Francis Brady, Father Sebastian of Mount Argus, a\r\nbootblack at the General Post Office, Hugh E. (Blazes) Boylan and so\r\neach and so on to no last term.\r\n\r\nWhat were his reflections concerning the last member of this series and\r\nlate occupant of the bed?\r\n\r\nReflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a\r\nbillsticker), commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a\r\nboaster).\r\n\r\nWhy for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal\r\nproportion and commercial ability?\r\n\r\nBecause he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding\r\nmembers of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably\r\ntransmitted, first with alarm, then with understanding, then with\r\ndesire, finally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene\r\ncomprehension and apprehension.\r\n\r\nWith what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections\r\naffected?\r\n\r\nEnvy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.\r\n\r\nEnvy?\r\n\r\nOf a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the\r\nsuperincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic\r\npiston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of\r\na constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental\r\nfemale organism, passive but not obtuse.\r\n\r\nJealousy?\r\n\r\nBecause a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately\r\nthe agent and reagent of attraction. Because attraction between\r\nagent(s) and reagent(s) at all instants varied, with inverse proportion\r\nof increase and decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial\r\nreentrance. Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of\r\nattraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.\r\n\r\nAbnegation?\r\n\r\nIn virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September 1903 in the\r\nestablishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, 5 Eden\r\nQuay, b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and\r\nreappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of\r\nambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d)\r\nextraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial\r\nprerogative, e) an imminent provincial musical tour, common current\r\nexpenses, net proceeds divided.\r\n\r\nEquanimity?\r\n\r\nAs as natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or\r\nunderstood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in\r\naccordance with his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar\r\nsimilarity. As not so calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the\r\nplanet in consequence of a collision with a dark sun. As less\r\nreprehensible than theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and\r\nanimals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement,\r\nmisappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust,\r\nmalingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal libel, blackmail,\r\ncontempt of court, arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the high seas,\r\ntrespass, burglary, jailbreaking, practice of unnatural vice, desertion\r\nfrom armed forces in the field, perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence\r\nwith the king’s enemies, impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter,\r\nwilful and premeditated murder. As not more abnormal than all other\r\nparallel processes of adaptation to altered conditions of existence,\r\nresulting in a reciprocal equilibrium between the bodily organism and\r\nits attendant circumstances, foods, beverages, acquired habits,\r\nindulged inclinations, significant disease. As more than inevitable,\r\nirreparable.\r\n\r\nWhy more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?\r\n\r\nFrom outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but\r\noutrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially\r\nviolated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the\r\nadulterously violated.\r\n\r\nWhat retribution, if any?\r\n\r\nAssassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right. Duel by\r\ncombat, no. Divorce, not now. Exposure by mechanical artifice\r\n(automatic bed) or individual testimony (concealed ocular witnesses),\r\nnot yet. Suit for damages by legal influence or simulation of assault\r\nwith evidence of injuries sustained (selfinflicted), not impossibly.\r\nHushmoney by moral influence, possibly. If any, positively, connivance,\r\nintroduction of emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of\r\npublicity: moral, a successful rival agent of intimacy), depreciation,\r\nalienation, humiliation, separation protecting the one separated from\r\nthe other, protecting the separator from both.\r\n\r\nBy what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void of\r\nincertitude, justify to himself his sentiments?\r\n\r\nThe preordained frangibility of the hymen: the presupposed\r\nintangibility of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion\r\nbetween the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and\r\nthe selfabbreviating relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously\r\ninferred debility of the female: the muscularity of the male: the\r\nvariations of ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by\r\ninversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite\r\nproposition (parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic\r\ntransitive verb with direct feminine object) from the active voice into\r\nits correlative aorist preterite proposition (parsed as feminine\r\nsubject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past\r\nparticiple with complementary masculine agent) in the passive voice:\r\nthe continued product of seminators by generation: the continual\r\nproduction of semen by distillation: the futility of triumph or protest\r\nor vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of\r\nnescient matter: the apathy of the stars.\r\n\r\nIn what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and\r\nreflections, reduced to their simplest forms, converge?\r\n\r\nSatisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial\r\nhemispheres, in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored\r\n(the land of the midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of\r\nGreece, the land of promise), of adipose anterior and posterior female\r\nhemispheres, redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and\r\nseminal warmth, reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude,\r\ninsusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression,\r\nexpressive of mute immutable mature animality.\r\n\r\nThe visible signs of antesatisfaction?\r\n\r\nAn approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation: a\r\ntentative revelation: a silent contemplation.\r\n\r\nThen?\r\n\r\nHe kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on each\r\nplump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscure\r\nprolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation.\r\n\r\nThe visible signs of postsatisfaction?\r\n\r\nA silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: a\r\nsolicitous aversion: a proximate erection.\r\n\r\nWhat followed this silent action?\r\n\r\nSomnolent invocation, less somnolent recognition, incipient excitation,\r\ncatechetical interrogation.\r\n\r\nWith what modifications did the narrator reply to this interrogation?\r\n\r\nNegative: he omitted to mention the clandestine correspondence between\r\nMartha Clifford and Henry Flower, the public altercation at, in and in\r\nthe vicinity of the licensed premises of Bernard Kiernan and Co,\r\nLimited, 8, 9 and 10 Little Britain street, the erotic provocation and\r\nresponse thereto caused by the exhibitionism of Gertrude (Gerty),\r\nsurname unknown. Positive: he included mention of a performance by Mrs\r\nBandmann Palmer of _Leah_ at the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South\r\nKing street, an invitation to supper at Wynn’s (Murphy’s) Hotel, 35, 36\r\nand 37 Lower Abbey street, a volume of peccaminous pornographical\r\ntendency entituled _Sweets of Sin_, anonymous author a gentleman of\r\nfashion, a temporary concussion caused by a falsely calculated movement\r\nin the course of a postcenal gymnastic display, the victim (since\r\ncompletely recovered) being Stephen Dedalus, professor and author,\r\neldest surviving son of Simon Dedalus, of no fixed occupation, an\r\naeronautical feat executed by him (narrator) in the presence of a\r\nwitness, the professor and author aforesaid, with promptitude of\r\ndecision and gymnastic flexibility.\r\n\r\nWas the narration otherwise unaltered by modifications?\r\n\r\nAbsolutely.\r\n\r\nWhich event or person emerged as the salient point of his narration?\r\n\r\nStephen Dedalus, professor and author.\r\n\r\nWhat limitations of activity and inhibitions of conjugal rights were\r\nperceived by listener and narrator concerning themselves during the\r\ncourse of this intermittent and increasingly more laconic narration?\r\n\r\nBy the listener a limitation of fertility inasmuch as marriage had been\r\ncelebrated 1 calendar month after the 18th anniversary of her birth (8\r\nSeptember 1870), viz. 8 October, and consummated on the same date with\r\nfemale issue born 15 June 1889, having been anticipatorily consummated\r\non the 10 September of the same year and complete carnal intercourse,\r\nwith ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ, having last\r\ntaken place 5 weeks previous, viz. 27 November 1893, to the birth on 29\r\nDecember 1893 of second (and only male) issue, deceased 9 January 1894,\r\naged 11 days, there remained a period of 10 years, 5 months and 18 days\r\nduring which carnal intercourse had been incomplete, without\r\nejaculation of semen within the natural female organ. By the narrator a\r\nlimitation of activity, mental and corporal, inasmuch as complete\r\nmental intercourse between himself and the listener had not taken place\r\nsince the consummation of puberty, indicated by catamenic hemorrhage,\r\nof the female issue of narrator and listener, 15 September 1903, there\r\nremained a period of 9 months and 1 day during which, in consequence of\r\na preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the\r\nconsummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty of\r\naction had been circumscribed.\r\n\r\nHow?\r\n\r\nBy various reiterated feminine interrogation concerning the masculine\r\ndestination whither, the place where, the time at which, the duration\r\nfor which, the object with which in the case of temporary absences,\r\nprojected or effected.\r\n\r\nWhat moved visibly above the listener’s and the narrator’s invisible\r\nthoughts?\r\n\r\nThe upcast reflection of a lamp and shade, an inconstant series of\r\nconcentric circles of varying gradations of light and shadow.\r\n\r\nIn what directions did listener and narrator lie?\r\n\r\nListener, S. E. by E.: Narrator, N. W. by W.: on the 53rd parallel of\r\nlatitude, N., and 6th meridian of longitude, W.: at an angle of 45° to\r\nthe terrestrial equator.\r\n\r\nIn what state of rest or motion?\r\n\r\nAt rest relatively to themselves and to each other. In motion being\r\neach and both carried westward, forward and rereward respectively, by\r\nthe proper perpetual motion of the earth through everchanging tracks of\r\nneverchanging space.\r\n\r\nIn what posture?\r\n\r\nListener: reclined semilaterally, left, left hand under head, right leg\r\nextended in a straight line and resting on left leg, flexed, in the\r\nattitude of Gea-Tellus, fulfilled, recumbent, big with seed. Narrator:\r\nreclined laterally, left, with right and left legs flexed, the index\r\nfinger and thumb of the right hand resting on the bridge of the nose,\r\nin the attitude depicted in a snapshot photograph made by Percy Apjohn,\r\nthe childman weary, the manchild in the womb.\r\n\r\nWomb? Weary?\r\n\r\nHe rests. He has travelled.\r\n\r\nWith?\r\n\r\nSinbad the Sailor and Tinbad the Tailor and Jinbad the Jailer and\r\nWhinbad the Whaler and Ninbad the Nailer and Finbad the Failer and\r\nBinbad the Bailer and Pinbad the Pailer and Minbad the Mailer and\r\nHinbad the Hailer and Rinbad the Railer and Dinbad the Kailer and\r\nVinbad the Quailer and Linbad the Yailer and Xinbad the Phthailer.\r\n\r\nWhen?\r\n\r\nGoing to dark bed there was a square round Sinbad the Sailor roc’s\r\nauk’s egg in the night of the bed of all the auks of the rocs of\r\nDarkinbad the Brightdayler.\r\n\r\nWhere?\r\n\r\n•\r\n\n[ 18 ]\r\n\nYes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his\r\nbreakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the _City Arms_ hotel when\r\nhe used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his\r\nhighness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan\r\nthat he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing\r\nall for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was\r\nactually afraid to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all\r\nher ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and\r\nearthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God\r\nhelp the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and\r\nlownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was\r\npious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like\r\nher a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a\r\nwelleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here\r\nand Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her\r\ndog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats\r\nespecially then still I like that in him polite to old women like that\r\nand waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always\r\nif ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much\r\nbetter for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but I\r\nsuppose Id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have\r\na hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till\r\nthey throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as\r\nmuch a nun as Im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre\r\nsick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was\r\nO tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he\r\nsprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day\r\nI wore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones\r\nshe could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into\r\na mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying\r\non account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more\r\nlike a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same\r\nbesides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor\r\nparing his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I\r\nwas sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it\r\nnot to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by\r\nhis appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her\r\nso either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was\r\nreally and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it\r\nplanning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember\r\nMenton and who else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he\r\nnot long married flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and\r\nturned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what\r\nharm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to\r\nhim mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever\r\nmet and thats called a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle\r\nin bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in\r\nwith somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as\r\nI do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a\r\nletter when I came into the front room to show him Dignams death in the\r\npaper as if something told me and he covered it up with the\r\nblottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably\r\nthat was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all\r\nmen get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is\r\nnow so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old\r\nfool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I\r\ncare two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though\r\nId like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under my\r\nnose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace\r\npadding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell\r\nof those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by\r\ngetting him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat\r\nwithout that one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was\r\ndrinking water 1 woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of\r\ncourse ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table\r\non Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my house stealing\r\nmy potatoes and the oysters 2/6 per doz going out to see her aunt if\r\nyou please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something on\r\nwith that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you\r\nhave no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters\r\nbut I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be\r\nalone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I\r\nfound in her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a\r\nlittle bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave\r\nher her weeks notice I saw to that better do without them altogether do\r\nout the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out\r\nthe dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I\r\ncouldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar\r\nand sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the\r\nplace in the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because\r\nhe couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere\r\nand the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan\r\ngave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there\r\nsteals another I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb\r\nto squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming love because he\r\nhas an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out\r\nand going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the\r\nsatisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be\r\nalways and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking\r\nboy to do it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id\r\nconfuse him a little alone with him if we were Id let him see my\r\ngarters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him I\r\nknow what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging\r\ndrawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this\r\nthat and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I would\r\nbecause I told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in\r\nthe jews temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a\r\nstranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and\r\nhe tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he\r\nis who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it\r\ntell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yes imagine\r\nIm him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what\r\nhe never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply\r\nruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it\r\ntill he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your\r\nlips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the\r\nworld about it people make its only the first time after that its just\r\nthe ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man\r\nwithout going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when\r\nyou feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself I wish\r\nsome man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in\r\nhis arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul\r\nalmost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used to go to\r\nFather Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and\r\nI said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my\r\nchild on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where\r\nyou sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done\r\nwith it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put\r\nit I forget no father and I always think of the real father what did he\r\nwant to know for when I already confessed it to God he had a nice fat\r\nhand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he\r\nId say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know me in\r\nthe box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never\r\nturn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost\r\nfor a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them\r\nId like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense\r\noff him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre\r\nmarried hes too careful about himself then give something to H H the\r\npope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didnt\r\nlike his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though\r\nI laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of\r\nhis fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it\r\nwho gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of\r\ndrink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they\r\nstick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking\r\ngreen and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with\r\nthe opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American\r\nthat had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do\r\nto keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took\r\nthe port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt\r\nlovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I\r\npopped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful\r\nto us I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when\r\nI blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in\r\nGibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and\r\ntell you theres no God what could you do if it was running and rushing\r\nabout nothing only make an act of contrition the candle I lit that\r\nevening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see it\r\nbrought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to\r\nchurch mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only\r\ngrey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I\r\nlit the lamp because he must have come 3 or 4 times with that\r\ntremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or\r\nwhatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is\r\nnot so big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my\r\nhours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a\r\nthick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think\r\na few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life\r\nfelt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must\r\nhave eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with\r\na big hole in the middle of us or like a Stallion driving it up into\r\nyou because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious\r\nlook in his eye I had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a\r\ntremendous amount of spunk in him when I made him pull out and do it on\r\nme considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt\r\nwashed out properly the last time I let him finish it in me nice\r\ninvention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if\r\nsomeone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I went\r\nthrough with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and Mina\r\nPurefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up\r\nwith a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a\r\nsmell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like\r\na nigger with a shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the\r\nlast time I was there a squad of them falling over one another and\r\nbawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied\r\ntill they have us swollen out like elephants or I dont know what\r\nsupposing I risked having another not off him though still if he was\r\nmarried Im sure hed have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has\r\nmore spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting\r\nJosie Powell and the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him\r\noff well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good I\r\nknow they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he was dancing\r\nand sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming\r\nand then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not\r\nliking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over\r\npolitics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a\r\ncarpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive\r\nabout everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for\r\nI knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he\r\nannoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot\r\nof mixedup things especially about the body and the inside I often\r\nwanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family\r\nphysician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was\r\ncrowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolness on with\r\nher over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever\r\nhe asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me\r\nthe present of Byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that\r\nfinished that I could quite easily get him to make it up any time I\r\nknow how Id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out\r\nto see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the onions I know\r\nplenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch\r\nhim with my veil and gloves on going out 1 kiss then would send them\r\nall spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of\r\ncourse would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him\r\nthat I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love\r\nhim and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might\r\nimagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of\r\na manner like he did to me though I had the devils own job to get it\r\nout of him though I liked him for that it showed he could hold in and\r\nwasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the\r\nnight in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres something I\r\nwant to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in a temper\r\nwith my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let out too\r\nmuch the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let him know\r\nmore than was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie\r\nwhenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when I\r\nsaid I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash\r\npossible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick\r\nwhen hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the\r\nindifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what\r\nspoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at\r\nthat time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he was\r\ntoo beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged\r\nafterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of\r\nlaughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling\r\nout one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great\r\nhumour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it\r\nmeant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us\r\nnot all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault\r\nshe didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes\r\ngot like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her\r\nface beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she\r\nmust have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment\r\nshe was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk\r\nabout him to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes\r\nhe used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him\r\njust imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might\r\nmurder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes\r\nmad Poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when\r\nhe comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he\r\nalways takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and\r\nnow hes going about in his slippers to look for £ 10000 for a postcard\r\nU p up O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff\r\nto extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what\r\ncould you make of a man like that Id rather die 20 times over than\r\nmarry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like\r\nme to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and\r\nhe knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrick\r\nthat poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with some other man\r\nyes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and\r\ndo a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating\r\ndrive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask\r\nus to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because\r\nthey cant get on without us white Arsenic she put in his tea off\r\nflypaper wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say\r\nits from the Greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have\r\nbeen madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being\r\nhanged O she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do\r\nbesides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they\r\n\r\ntheyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he\r\nnoticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C\r\nwith Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both\r\nordered 2 teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his\r\ntwo old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it\r\nwas what do I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed\r\nbreeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting\r\nall myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long\r\none I did I forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got\r\nafter some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish\r\ntimes lost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to\r\nMrs Marion Bloom and I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the\r\nturning door he was looking when I looked back and I went there for tea\r\n2 days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him\r\nbecause I was crossing them when we were in the other room first he\r\nmeant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that\r\nif I only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill\r\nstick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still\r\nI made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of\r\na concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to\r\nmull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my\r\nstockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another\r\ntime it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I\r\ncould find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world\r\nthat I what did he say I could give 9 points in 10 to Katty Lanner and\r\nbeat her what does that mean I asked him I forget what he said because\r\nthe stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in\r\nthe Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his face before somewhere\r\nI noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I took my time Bartell\r\nDArcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on\r\nthe choir stairs after I sang Gounods _Ave Maria_ what are we waiting\r\nfor O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown\r\npart he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was\r\nalways raving about if you can believe him I liked the way he used his\r\nmouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a\r\nplace like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him\r\nabout that some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there\r\nand show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it\r\nor lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an\r\nidea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got\r\nme so cheap as he did he was 10 times worse himself anyhow begging me\r\nto give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming\r\nalong Kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had\r\nto take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape\r\nof my bedroom so I let him keep it as if I forgot it to think of me\r\nwhen I saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject\r\nof drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced\r\nthings on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels\r\neven when Milly and I were out with him at the open air fete that one\r\nin the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see\r\nevery atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain\r\nI saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the\r\nHarolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the\r\nZingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking\r\nslyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they\r\ncan go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on\r\nit and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were\r\nyou where are you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me\r\nhis eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it\r\nwas getting too warm for him so I halfturned and stopped then he\r\npestered me to say yes till I took off my glove slowly watching him he\r\nsaid my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an\r\nexcuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time\r\ntill I promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his\r\nwaistcoat pocket _O Maria Santisima_ he did look a big fool dreeping in\r\nthe rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them\r\nand beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I had on with the\r\nsunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet\r\nif I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you\r\nnever know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it\r\nif anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched his trousers\r\noutside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keep him\r\nfrom doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out was he\r\ncircumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do\r\neverything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting\r\nall the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the\r\nbutchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me\r\nthat letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to\r\nany woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we\r\nmet asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw\r\nI wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was\r\nalways breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky\r\nman and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake\r\ndont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it\r\nused to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in\r\nGibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children\r\nseeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice\r\na day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman\r\nwhen he sent me the 8 big poppies because mine was the 8th then I wrote\r\nthe night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it\r\nsimply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to\r\nembrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the\r\nsame time four I hate people who come at all hours answer the door you\r\nthink its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the\r\ndoor of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface\r\nGoodwin called about the concert in Lombard street and I just after\r\ndinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me\r\nprofessor I had to say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in\r\nhis way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out\r\nyou have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today I\r\nthought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches\r\nfirst and I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was\r\ntrying to make a fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he\r\nmust have been a bit late because it was 1/4 after 3 when I saw the 2\r\nDedalus girls coming from school I never know the time even that watch\r\nhe gave me never seems to go properly Id want to get it looked after\r\nwhen I threw the penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty\r\nwhen I was whistling there is a charming girl I love and I hadnt even\r\nput on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week\r\nwere to go to Belfast just as well he has to go to Ennis his fathers\r\nanniversary the 27th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms\r\nat the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new\r\nbed I couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next\r\nroom or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the\r\nwall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all\r\nvery well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we\r\nnever did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes\r\ngoing where he is besides something always happens with him the time\r\ngoing to the Mallow concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup for\r\nthe two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with\r\nthe soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and\r\nthe waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion\r\nfor the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two\r\ngentlemen in the 3rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was\r\ntoo hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a\r\ngood job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd\r\nhave taken us on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him\r\nO I love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I\r\nwonder will he take a 1st class for me he might want to do it in the\r\ntrain by tipping the guard well O I suppose therell be the usual idiots\r\nof men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly\r\nbe that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone\r\nin the carriage that day going to Howth Id like to find out something\r\nabout him 1 or 2 tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the\r\nwindow all the nicer then coming back suppose I never came back what\r\nwould they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last\r\nconcert I sang at where its over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall\r\nClarendon St little chits of missies they have now singing Kathleen\r\nKearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my\r\nsinging the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for Lord Roberts\r\nwhen I had the map of it all and Poldy not Irish enough was it him\r\nmanaged it this time I wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to\r\nsing in the _Stabat Mater_ by going around saying he was putting Lead\r\nKindly Light to music I put him up to that till the jesuits found out\r\nhe was a freemason thumping the piano lead Thou me on copied from some\r\nold opera yes and he was going about with some of them Sinner Fein\r\nlately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and\r\nnonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very\r\nintelligent the coming man Griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats\r\nall I can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott I\r\nhate the mention of their politics after the war that Pretoria and\r\nLadysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner lieut Stanley G 8th Bn 2nd\r\nEast Lancs Rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and\r\njust the right height over me Im sure he was brave too he said I was\r\nlovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my Irish beauty\r\nhe was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the\r\nroad he couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never felt they could\r\nhave made their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul and the rest of\r\nthe other old Krugers go and fight it out between them instead of\r\ndragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their\r\nfever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad I love\r\nto see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the Spanish\r\ncavalry at La Roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from\r\nAlgeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham\r\nbattles on the 15 acres the Black Watch with their kilts in time at the\r\nmarch past the 10th hussars the prince of Wales own or the lancers O\r\nthe lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won Tugela his father made\r\nhis money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me\r\na nice present up in Belfast after what I gave him theyve lovely linen\r\nup there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a mothball like\r\nI had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going\r\nround with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave\r\nthis ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the\r\nknuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or\r\ntell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go\r\nand smother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money\r\nand hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I\r\ncould find out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when\r\nI looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the\r\nexpression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with\r\nhis big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat\r\nalways having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from\r\nbehind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the\r\ndogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so\r\nquiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the\r\nway it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish\r\ntie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly\r\nwelloff I know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he\r\nwas like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the\r\nstoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost 20\r\nquid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for\r\nme on account of Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that\r\nsponger he was making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming\r\nback that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor\r\nlooking at me with his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first\r\nnoticed him at dessert when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I\r\nwished I could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my\r\nfingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for\r\nI didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers\r\nwere hallmarked silver too I wish I had some I could easily have\r\nslipped a couple into my muff when I was playing with them then always\r\nhanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down\r\nyour throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a\r\ngreat compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case\r\nif its going to go on I want at least two other good chemises for one\r\nthing and but I dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all I\r\nthink didnt he say yes and half the girls in Gibraltar never wore them\r\neither naked as God made them that Andalusian singing her Manola she\r\ndidnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of\r\nsilkette stockings is laddered after one days wear I could have brought\r\nthem back to Lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one\r\nchange them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into\r\nhim and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets Id\r\nwant advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips\r\nhe saved the one I have but thats no good what did they say they give a\r\ndelightful figure line 11/6 obviating that unsightly broad appearance\r\nacross the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill\r\nhave to knock off the stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it\r\nthe last they sent from ORourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his\r\nmoney easy Larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a\r\ncottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret\r\nthat he couldnt get anyone to drink God spare his spit for fear hed die\r\nof the drouth or I must do a few breathing exercises I wonder is that\r\nantifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the\r\nfashion now garters that much I have the violet pair I wore today thats\r\nall he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first O no there was\r\nthe face lotion I finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like\r\nnew I told him over and over again get that made up in the same place\r\nand dont forget it God only knows whether he did after all I said to\r\nhim Ill know by the bottle anyway if not I suppose Ill only have to\r\nwash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax\r\nand violet I thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the\r\nskin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger\r\nafter the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry\r\nhandkerchiefs about 6/- in all sure you cant get on in this world\r\nwithout style all going in food and rent when I get it Ill lash it\r\naround I tell you in fine style I always want to throw a handful of tea\r\ninto the pot measuring and mincing if I buy a pair of old brogues\r\nitself do you like those new shoes yes were they Ive no clothes at all\r\nthe brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners\r\n3 whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the\r\nother the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because\r\nthey know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every\r\nday for the 4 years more I have of life up to 35 no Im what am I at all\r\nIll be 33 in September will I what O well look at that Mrs Galbraith\r\nshes much older than me I saw her when I was out last week her beautys\r\non the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down\r\nto her waist tossing it back like that like Kitty OShea in Grantham\r\nstreet 1st thing I did every morning to look across see her combing it\r\nas if she loved it and was full of it pity I only got to know her the\r\nday before we left and that Mrs Langtry the jersey lily the prince of\r\nWales was in love with I suppose hes like the first man going the roads\r\nonly for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black\r\nmans Id like to try a beauty up to what was she 45 there was some funny\r\nstory about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster\r\nknife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and\r\nthe prince of Wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing\r\nlike that like some of those books he brings me the works of Master\r\nFrancois Somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her\r\near because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and\r\nher a—e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that\r\npretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody\r\ncan see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that\r\ntwice I remember when I came to page 50 the part about where she hangs\r\nhim up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a\r\nwoman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out\r\nof her slipper after the ball was over like the infant Jesus in the\r\ncrib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could have\r\na child that big taken out of her and I thought first it came out of\r\nher side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and\r\nshe a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was in Gibraltar\r\nthe year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where he planted\r\nthe tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me\r\ntoo if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought to\r\nchuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it\r\nand go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank\r\nwhere they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day\r\nof course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with\r\nhim any side whats your programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe\r\nlike father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching\r\nabout for advertisements when he could have been in Mr Cuffes still\r\nonly for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could\r\nhave got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada\r\nonce or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly\r\nMrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I\r\nlost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming\r\ninto fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was no\r\ngood by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and Burns as\r\nI said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot\r\nof trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me\r\naltogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and\r\ncooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if I\r\nwent by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes\r\ntake that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles\r\noff my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my\r\nbackside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in\r\nGrafton street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as\r\ninsolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were\r\ngiving you too much trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of\r\nher yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second\r\ntime he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see\r\nhim looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for\r\nme it was nice of him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs\r\nBloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him\r\nbeing insulted and me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled\r\nI know my chest was out that way at the door when he said Im extremely\r\nsorry and Im sure you were\r\n\r\nyes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he\r\nmade me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one\r\nanyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep\r\nthat up and Ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out\r\nfor him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made 2\r\nthe same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up\r\nthere like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to

Jack\r\nflying with all her carabineros because 4 drunken English sailors took\r\nall the rock from them and because I didnt run into mass often enough\r\nin Santa Maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there\r\nwas a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black\r\nblessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing 3 times on\r\nEaster Sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell\r\nbringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his Majestad an\r\nadmirer he signed it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him\r\nup when I saw him following me along the Calle Real in the shop window\r\nthen he tipped me just in passing but I never thought hed write making\r\nan appointment I had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it\r\nup in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill\r\ninstructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps\r\nsinging I remember shall I wear a white rose

put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was\r\nsweetlike young I put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way\r\nwhat did I tell him I was engaged for for fun to the son of a Spanish\r\nnobleman named Don Miguel de la Flora and he believed me that I was to\r\nbe married to him in 3 years time theres many a true word spoken in\r\njest there is a flower that bloometh a few things I told him true about\r\nmyself just for him to be imagining the Spanish girls he didnt like I\r\nsuppose one of them wouldnt have him I got him excited he crushed all\r\nthe flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and\r\nthe perragordas till I taught him Cappoquin he came from he said on the\r\nblack water but it was too short then the day before he left May yes it\r\nwas May when the infant king of Spain was born Im always like that in\r\nthe spring Id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the\r\nrockgun near OHaras tower I told him it was struck by lightning and all\r\nabout the old Barbary apes they sent to Clapham without a tail\r\ncareering all over the show on each others back Mrs Rubio said she was\r\na regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of Inces farm and\r\nthrow stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me I had that\r\nwhite blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as I could\r\nwithout too openly they were just beginning to be plump I said I was\r\ntired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place I suppose it must be\r\nthe highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those\r\nfrightful rocks and Saint Michaels cave with the icicles or whatever\r\nthey call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots\r\nIm sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to Africa when\r\nthey die the ships out far like chips that was the Malta boat passing\r\nyes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever\r\nhe caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there I\r\nwas leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness\r\nout of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last\r\nday transparent kind of shirt he had I could see his chest pink he\r\nwanted to touch mine with his for a moment but I wouldnt let him he was\r\nawfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me\r\nwith a child embarazada that old servant Ines told me that one drop\r\neven if it got into you at all after I tried with the Banana but I was\r\nafraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once\r\ntook something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered\r\nwith limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of\r\nyoud think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with\r\nyou in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling\r\nthere so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes O yes I\r\npulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but I\r\nopened my legs I wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because I\r\nhad a skirt opening up the side I tormented the life out of him first\r\ntickling him I loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt\r\nawokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the\r\nsame I liked him like that moaning I made him blush a little when I got\r\nover him that way when I unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back\r\nthe skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all Buttons men down the\r\nmiddle on the wrong side of them Molly darling he called me what was\r\nhis name Jack Joe Harry Mulvey was it yes I think a lieutenant he was\r\nrather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so I went round to the\r\nwhatyoucallit

now\r\nflying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly 20\r\nyears if I said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put\r\nhis hands over my eyes to guess who I might recognise him hes young\r\nstill about 40 perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is\r\nquite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has\r\nshe little knows what I did with her beloved husband before he ever\r\ndreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you\r\nmight say they could have put an article about it in the Chronicle I\r\nwas a bit wild after when I blew out the old bag the biscuits were in\r\nfrom Benady Bros and exploded it Lord what a bang all the woodcocks and\r\npigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle\r\nhill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to\r\nread out the Hebrew on them I wanted to fire his pistol he said he\r\nhadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he\r\nalways wore crooked as often as I settled it straight H M S Calypso\r\nswinging my hat that old Bishop that spoke off the altar his long\r\npreach about womans higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle\r\nand wearing peak caps and the new woman bloomers God send him sense and\r\nme more money I suppose theyre called after him I never thought that\r\nwould

married him well\r\nits better than Breen or Briggs does brig or those awful names with\r\nbottom in them Mrs Ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom Mulvey I\r\nwouldnt go mad about either or

road to Europa point twisting in and out all round the other\r\nside of Jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like\r\nMillys little ones now when she runs up the stairs I loved looking down\r\nat them I was jumping up at the pepper trees and the white poplars\r\npulling the leaves off and throwing them at him he went to India he was\r\nto write the voyages those men have to

I was thinking of him on the\r\nsea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at\r\nthe elevation weeks and weeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow\r\nfor the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that\r\nGibraltar only that cheap peau dEspagne that faded and left a stink on\r\nyou more than anything else I wanted to give him a memento he gave me\r\nthat clumsy Claddagh ring for luck that I gave Gardner going to south\r\nAfrica where those Boers killed him with their war and fever but they\r\nwere well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it\r\nlike an opal or pearl still it must have been pure 18 carrot gold\r\nbecause it was very heavy but what could you get in a place like that\r\nthe sandfrog shower from Africa and that

the horses toenails first like he does with the letters\r\nno not with Boylan there yes with some cold veal and ham mixed\r\nsandwiches there are little houses down at the bottom of the banks\r\nthere

in through the bottom and his oar slipping\r\nout of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim of\r\ncourse me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his\r\nflannel trousers Id like to have tattered them down off him before all\r\nthe people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was\r\nblack and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed\r\nchap I dont know who he is with that other beauty Burke out of the City\r\nArms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he\r\nwasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was\r\nno love lost between us thats 1 consolation I wonder what kind is that\r\nbook he brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other\r\nMr de Kock I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with\r\nhis tube from one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white\r\nshoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather\r\nall blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell\r\nof the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan\r\nbay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the\r\nfishermens baskets old Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa\r\nand the tall old chap with the earrings I dont like a man you have to\r\nclimb up to to get at I suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago\r\nbesides I dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at\r\nnight I suppose Ill have to put up with it I never brought a bit of\r\nsalt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was\r\ngoing to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or\r\nBlooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the\r\nway his father did down in Ennis like all the things he told father he\r\nwas going to do and me but I saw through him telling me all the lovely\r\nplaces we could go for the honeymoon Venice by moonlight with the\r\ngondolas and the lake of Como he had a picture cut out of some paper of\r\nand mandolines and lanterns O how nice I said whatever I liked he was\r\ngoing to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry\r\nmy can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the\r\nplans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old\r\nbeggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and\r\nput his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of\r\nthat hardened criminal he was called in Lloyds Weekly news 20 years in\r\njail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine\r\nhis poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles\r\naway from I couldnt rest easy till I bolted all the doors and windows\r\nto make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a\r\nmadhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute\r\nlike that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed\r\nId cut them off him so I would not that hed be much use still better\r\nthan nothing the night I was sure I heard burglars in the kitchen and\r\nhe went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was\r\nlooking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits\r\nmaking as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit\r\nthere isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling\r\nespecially now with Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl\r\ndown there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather\r\ninstead of sending her to Skerrys academy where shed have to learn not\r\nlike me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the\r\nsame on account of me and Boylan thats why he did it Im certain the way\r\nhe plots and plans everything out I couldnt turn round with her in the\r\nplace lately unless I bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming\r\nin without knocking first when I put the chair against the door just as\r\nI was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then\r\ndoing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to\r\nlook at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack\r\nstatue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that I got\r\nthat little Italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for 2\r\nshillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right\r\nnot to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking to her lately at\r\nthe table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to\r\nunderstand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant\r\nsay I pretend things can he Im too honest as a matter of fact and\r\nhelping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its\r\nme shed tell not him I suppose he thinks Im finished out and laid on\r\nthe shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see well see now\r\nshes well on for flirting too with Tom Devans two sons imitating me\r\nwhistling with those romps of Murray girls calling for her can Milly\r\ncome out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her\r\nround in Nelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night its as well\r\nhe sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to\r\ngo on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose I\r\nsmelt it off her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button I\r\nsewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I\r\ntell you only I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a\r\nparting and the last plumpudding too split in 2 halves see it comes out\r\nno matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your\r\nblouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle\r\nblackbottom and I had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on\r\nshow on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at\r\nher like me when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you\r\nthen a great touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the\r\nTheatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching me\r\nafraid of her life Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that\r\ntouching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always\r\ntrying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for\r\nBeerbohm Tree in Trilby the last time Ill ever go there to be squashed\r\nlike that for any Trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me\r\nthere and looking away hes a bit daft I think I saw him after trying to\r\nget near two stylishdressed ladies outside Switzers window at the same\r\nlittle game I recognised him on the moment the face and everything but\r\nhe didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the\r\nBroadstone going away well I hope shell get someone to dance attendance\r\non her the way I did when she was down with the mumps and her glands\r\nswollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything\r\ndeep yet I never came properly till I was what 22 or so it went into\r\nthe wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that\r\nConny Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with\r\nsealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he\r\nlooked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and\r\nsupper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man\r\ngives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are a\r\nfew men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it\r\nreally happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love\r\nin their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each\r\nother that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit\r\nfoolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and\r\npoison himself after her still poor old man I suppose he felt lost shes\r\nalways making love to my things too the few old rags I have wanting to\r\nput her hair up at 15 my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time\r\nenough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes\r\npretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I was too\r\nbut theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a\r\nfishwoman when I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we\r\nmet Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to\r\nsee us in her trap with Friery the solicitor we werent grand enough\r\ntill I gave her 2 damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that\r\nnow for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me\r\nthat exasperated of course contradicting I was badtempered too because\r\nhow was it there was a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night\r\nbefore cheese I ate was it and I told her over and over again not to\r\nleave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as\r\nshe said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith I will that was\r\nthe last time she turned on the teartap I was just like that myself\r\nthey darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the\r\ntwo of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am I ever\r\ngoing to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming\r\nId have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that\r\nold Mrs Fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the\r\nthings into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course\r\nshes old she cant help it a good job I found that rotten old smelly\r\ndishcloth that got lost behind the dresser I knew there was something\r\nand opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends\r\nto entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you\r\nplease that might have been mad especially Simon Dedalus son his father\r\nsuch a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the\r\ncricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at\r\nthe other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won\r\nthem in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody\r\nsaw him that knew us I wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand\r\nfuneral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody\r\nhawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head\r\nI ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been\r\nhanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the\r\nironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was\r\nsomething else and she never even rendered down the fat I told her and\r\nnow shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband\r\ngetting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they\r\nhave to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats\r\nher Ill have to hunt around again for someone every day I get up theres\r\nsome new thing on sweet God sweet God well when Im stretched out dead\r\nin my grave I suppose Ill have some peace I want to get up a minute if\r\nIm let wait O Jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt\r\nthat afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he\r\nhad up in me now what am I to do Friday Saturday Sunday wouldnt that\r\npester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do God knows\r\ntheres always something wrong with us 5 days every 3 or 4 weeks usual\r\nmonthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like\r\nthat the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn gave him\r\nto see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he did about\r\ninsurance for him in Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I wouldnt\r\ngive in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his\r\nglasses and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and his soul\r\nthats dead I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I could\r\nall in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested having to sit it\r\nout then to the last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in a hurry\r\nsupposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery\r\nhissing the woman adulteress he shouted I suppose he went and had a\r\nwoman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up\r\nfor it I wish he had what I had then hed boo I bet the cat itself is\r\nbetter off than us have we too much blood up in us or what O patience\r\nabove its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me\r\npregnant as big as he is I dont want to ruin the clean sheets I just\r\nput on I suppose the clean linen I wore brought it on too damn it damn\r\nit and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a\r\nvirgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you\r\ncould be a widow or divorced 40 times over a daub of red ink would do\r\nor blackberry juice no thats too purply O Jamesy let me up out of this\r\npooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what\r\nbetween clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too\r\njingling like the dickens I suppose they could hear us away over the\r\nother side of the park till I suggested to put the quilt on the floor\r\nwith the pillow under my bottom I wonder is it nicer in the day I think\r\nit is easy I think Ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me I\r\nmight look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next\r\ntime he turned up my clothes on me Id give anything to see his face\r\nwheres the chamber gone easy Ive a holy horror of its breaking under me\r\nafter that old commode I wonder was I too heavy sitting on his knee I\r\nmade him sit on the easychair purposely when I took off only my blouse\r\nand skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be\r\nhe never felt me I hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits\r\neasy God I remember one time I could scout it out straight whistling\r\nlike a man almost easy O Lord how noisy I hope theyre bubbles on it for\r\na wad of money from some fellow Ill have to perfume it in the morning\r\ndont forget I bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look\r\nhow white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit\r\nhere how soft like a peach easy God I wouldnt mind being a man and get\r\nup on a lovely woman O Lord what a row youre making like the jersey\r\nlily easy easy O how the waters come down at Lahore\r\n\r\nwho knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I\r\nsomething growing in me getting that thing like that every week when\r\nwas it last I Whit Monday yes its only about 3 weeks I ought to go to\r\nthe doctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that\r\nwhite thing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick\r\nDr Collins for womens diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called\r\nit I suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting\r\nround those rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every\r\nlittle fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of\r\ncourse so theyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last\r\nman in the world besides theres something queer about their children\r\nalways smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what\r\nI did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one\r\nthing gold maybe what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly\r\nold face for him with all my compriments I suppose hed know then and\r\ncould you pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the\r\nrock of Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by\r\nthe way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I\r\ncan squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and\r\nneedles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by\r\nMillys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the\r\nsame paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and\r\nasking me had I frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all\r\nthe words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked\r\nsideways I wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows\r\nwhat else still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out\r\nfrowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you\r\nlying strap O anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever\r\nenough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad\r\ncrazy letters my Precious one everything connected with your glorious\r\nBody everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and\r\nof joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he\r\nhad me always at myself 4 and 5 times a day sometimes and I said I\r\nhadnt are you sure O yes I said I am quite sure in a way that shut him\r\nup I knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited\r\nme I dont know how the first night ever we met when I was living in\r\nRehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about 10 minutes\r\nas if we met somewhere I suppose on account of my being jewess looking\r\nafter my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half\r\nsloothering smile on him and all the Doyles said he was going to stand\r\nfor a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to believe all his\r\nblather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool\r\nof a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be more classy O\r\nbeau pays de la Touraine that I never even sang once explaining and\r\nrigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy\r\nanything naturally then might he as a great favour the very 1st\r\nopportunity he got a chance in Brighton square running into my bedroom\r\npretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the Albion milk\r\nand sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still round it O I\r\nlaughed myself sick at him that day I better not make an alnight\r\nsitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so\r\nthat a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it I suppose\r\nthere isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at\r\nthe way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard\r\nbolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth\r\nbreathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to\r\nshow one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a\r\npinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out\r\nthat he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our Lords both put\r\ntogether all over Asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody\r\nI suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big\r\nsquare feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway\r\nwheres this those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the old press doesnt\r\ncreak ah I knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere\r\nstill she must have given him great value for his money of course he\r\nhas to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope theyll\r\nhave something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up God\r\nhelp us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always\r\nreminds me of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it often\r\nenough and he thinks father bought it from Lord Napier that I used to\r\nadmire when I was a little girl because I told him easy piano O I like\r\nmy bed God here we are as bad as ever after 16 years how many houses\r\nwere we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard\r\nstreet and Holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on\r\nthe run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the\r\nmen with our 4 sticks of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse\r\nand worse says Warden Daly that charming place on the landing always\r\nsomebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always\r\nknow who was in there last every time were just getting on right\r\nsomething happens or he puts his big foot in it Thoms and Helys and Mr\r\nCuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old\r\nlottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives\r\nimpudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the\r\nFreeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the\r\nfreemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along\r\nin the wet all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him much\r\nconsolation that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed\r\njudging by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres\r\nGeorges church bells wait 3 quarters the hour wait two oclock well\r\nthats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody\r\nclimbing down into the area if anybody saw him Ill knock him off that\r\nlittle habit tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt to see or Ill see if\r\nhe has that French letter still in his pocketbook I suppose he thinks I\r\ndont know deceitful men all their 20 pockets arent enough for their\r\nlies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont\r\nbelieve you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the Aristocrats\r\nMasterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in\r\nreal life without some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is\r\ndisgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads\r\nand no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about\r\nwith not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow\r\npoison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both\r\nsides and newlaid eggs I suppose Im nothing any more when I wouldnt let\r\nhim lick me in Holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the\r\none thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews\r\nused when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast\r\nor speak a word wanting to be petted so I thought I stood out enough\r\nfor one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his\r\nown pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont know what he forgets that\r\nwethen I dont Ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and\r\nlock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles I wonder\r\nwas it her Josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too\r\nno hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants\r\nme and Boylan though as for her Denis as she calls him that\r\nforlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some\r\nlittle bitch hes got in with even when I was with him with Milly at the\r\nCollege races that Hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his\r\nnob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at\r\nthose two doing skirt duty up and down I tried to wink at him first no\r\nuse of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of Mr\r\nPaddy Dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in\r\nthe paper Boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd\r\nbe something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind\r\nin black L Boom and Tom Kernan that drunken little barrelly man that\r\nbit his tongue off falling down the mens W C drunk in some place or\r\nother and Martin Cunningham and the two Dedaluses and Fanny MCoys\r\nhusband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye\r\ntrying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old\r\ngreen dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way\r\nlike dabbling on a rainy day I see it all now plainly and they call\r\nthat friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with\r\ntheir wives and families at home more especially Jack Power keeping\r\nthat barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be\r\nsick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still\r\nthough hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of\r\nthem well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches\r\nif I can help it making fun of him then behind his back I know well\r\nwhen he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to\r\nsquander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after\r\nhis wife and family goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im\r\nsorry in a way for him what are his wife and 5 children going to do\r\nunless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some\r\npub corner and her or her son waiting Bill Bailey wont you please come\r\nhome her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully\r\nbecoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at\r\nthe Glencree dinner and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he\r\nborrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in Holles street squeezed and\r\nsquashed into them and grinning all over his big Dolly face like a\r\nwellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough\r\nthat must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying 5/- in the\r\npreserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and\r\nSimon Dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the\r\nsecond verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly\r\nsang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying\r\ntoo when I sang Maritana with him at Freddy Mayers private opera he had\r\na delicious glorious voice Phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart\r\n_sweet_heart he always sang it not like Bartell DArcy sweet _tart_\r\ngoodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in\r\nit all over you like a warm showerbath O Maritana wildwood flower we\r\nsang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even\r\ntransposed and he was married at the time to May Goulding but then hed\r\nsay or do something to

now showing him my photo its not good of me I ought to have\r\ngot it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still I look\r\nyoung in it I wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and\r\nme too after all why not I saw him driving down to the Kingsbridge\r\nstation with his father and mother I was in mourning thats 11 years ago\r\nnow yes hed be 11 though what was the good in going into mourning for\r\nwhat was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for\r\nme I heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted\r\nhed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time\r\nhe was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord\r\nFauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw\r\nhim at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by God\r\nyes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when I laid out\r\nthe deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair

only\r\ngetting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry\r\nwhen I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not\r\nan ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I\r\nwonder is he too young hes about wait 88 I was married 88 Milly is 15\r\nyesterday 89 what age was he then at Dillons 5 or 6 about 88 I suppose\r\nhes 20 or more Im not too old for him if hes 23 or 24 I hope hes not\r\nthat stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting\r\ndown in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and talking of\r\ncourse he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was\r\nout of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not\r\na professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John Jameson\r\nthey all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont\r\nfind many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where\r\npoetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully\r\ncoming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point\r\nthe guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back\r\nthere again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that\r\nfor him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly\r\nbright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young\r\nstar itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to\r\ntalk to about yourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts\r\nad and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in\r\ntheir business we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like\r\nto meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young\r\nthose fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathingplace\r\nfrom the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or\r\nsomething and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men\r\nlike that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely\r\nlittle statue he bought I could look at him all day long curly head and\r\nhis shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and\r\npoetry for you I often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his\r\nlovely young cock there so simple I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth\r\nif nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and\r\nwhite he looks with his boyish face I would too in 1/2 a minute even if\r\nsome of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no\r\ndanger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men I\r\nsuppose never dream of washing it from 1 years end to the other the\r\nmost of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches Im sure\r\nitll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age\r\nIll throw them the 1st thing in the morning till I see if the wishcard\r\ncomes out or Ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out\r\nIll read and study all I can find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew\r\nwho he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the\r\nsame and I can teach him the other part Ill make him feel all over him\r\ntill he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and\r\nmistress publicly too with our 2 photographs in all the papers when he\r\nbecomes famous O but then what am I going to do about him though\r\n\r\nno thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no\r\nnothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because\r\nI didnt call him Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a\r\ncabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place\r\npulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so\r\nbarefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar\r\nway in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a\r\nbutcher or those old hypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course\r\nhes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might\r\nas well be in bed with what with a lion God Im sure hed have something\r\nbetter to say for himself an old Lion would O well I suppose its\r\nbecause they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he\r\ncouldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the\r\namount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white\r\nfor them always I wished I was one myself for a change just to try with\r\nthat thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so\r\nsoft when you touch it my uncle John has a thing long I heard those\r\ncornerboys saying passing the comer of Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary has\r\na thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it\r\ndidnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts\r\nhis thing long into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be\r\nyou put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick\r\nand choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl\r\nfor their different tastes like those houses round behind Irish street\r\nno but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me\r\nup no damn fear once I start I tell you for their stupid husbands\r\njealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling\r\nher husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if\r\nhe did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he\r\ngoing to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants of course\r\nthe man never even casts a 2nd thought on the husband or wife either\r\nits the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all\r\nthose desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young still can\r\nI its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with\r\nhim so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the\r\nwrong end of me not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a\r\nwomans bottom Id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything\r\nunnatural where we havent 1 atom of any kind of expression in us all of\r\nus the same 2 lumps of lard before ever Id do that to a man pfooh the\r\ndirty brutes the mere thought is enough I kiss the feet of you senorita\r\ntheres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a\r\nmadman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a\r\nwoman wants to be embraced 20 times a day almost to make her look young\r\nno matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the\r\nfellow you want isnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking\r\nwould I go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd\r\nknow me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not\r\ncare a pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of\r\nthose wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near\r\nthe Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could I only\r\nsent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back\r\nover and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow\r\nwith the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me\r\nup against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do\r\nthemselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that K C lives up\r\nsomewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the night he gave us\r\nthe fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course\r\nit was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and the walk and\r\nwhen I turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after\r\ncoming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his\r\nwife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten\r\nagain with disease O move over your big carcass out of that for the\r\nlove of Mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well\r\nhe may sleep and sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if he\r\nknew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to\r\nsigh for a dark man in some perplexity between 2 7s too in prison for\r\nLord knows what he does that I dont know and Im to be slooching around\r\ndown in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled\r\nup like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see me running Id just like\r\nto see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt I\r\ndont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be\r\ngoverned by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one\r\nanother and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around\r\ndrunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on\r\nhorses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop\r\nsure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know\r\nwhat it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they\r\nall of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I\r\nnever had thats why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away\r\nfrom his books and studies and not living at home on account of the\r\nusual rowy house I suppose well its a poor case that those that have a\r\nfine son like that theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to\r\nmake one it wasnt my fault we came together when I was watching the two\r\ndogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that\r\ndisheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in\r\nthat little woolly jacket I knitted crying as I was but give it to some\r\npoor child but I knew well Id never have another our 1st death too it\r\nwas we were never the same since O Im not going to think myself into\r\nthe glooms about that any more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I\r\nfelt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of\r\nroving around the city meeting God knows who nightwalkers and\r\npickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining\r\nhimself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent I used to\r\nlove coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends\r\nthey can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some\r\nwoman ready to stick her knife in you I hate that in women no wonder\r\nthey treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches I\r\nsuppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy Im not like\r\nthat he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room I\r\nsuppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly 20 of me in the\r\nnext room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm Dedalus I\r\nwonder its like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz Delagracia they had\r\nthe devils queer names there father Vilaplana of Santa Maria that gave\r\nme the rosary Rosales y OReilly in the Calle las Siete Revueltas and\r\nPisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street O what a name Id go and drown\r\nmyself in the first river if I had a name like her O my and all the\r\nbits of streets Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and Rodgers ramp and\r\nCrutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if I am\r\na harumscarum I know I am a bit I declare to God I dont feel a day\r\nolder than then I wonder could I get my tongue round any of the Spanish\r\ncomo esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see I havent forgotten it all\r\nI thought I had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person\r\nplace or thing pity I never tried to read that novel cantankerous Mrs\r\nRubio lent me by Valera with the questions in it all upside down the\r\ntwo ways I always knew wed go away in the end I can tell him the\r\nSpanish and he tell me the Italian then hell see Im not so ignorant\r\nwhat a pity he didnt stay Im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and\r\nwanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his breakfast in\r\nbed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on the knife for bad\r\nluck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and\r\nsomething nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might\r\nlike I never could bear the look of them in Abrines I could do the\r\ncriada the room looks all right since I changed it the other way you\r\nsee something was telling me all the time Id have to introduce myself\r\nnot knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his wife or pretend\r\nwe were in Spain with him half awake without a Gods notion where he is\r\ndos huevos estrellados senor Lord the cracked things come into my head\r\nsometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres\r\nthe room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back room he could do his\r\nwriting and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he\r\ndoes at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes\r\nmaking the breakfast for 1 he can make it for 2 Im sure Im not going to\r\ntake in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house\r\nlike this Id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated\r\nperson Id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those Turks with\r\nthe fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown\r\nthat I badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long\r\nago in Walpoles only 8/6 or 18/6 Ill just give him one more chance Ill\r\nget up early in the morning Im sick of Cohens old bed in any case I\r\nmight go over to the markets to see all the vegetables and cabbages and\r\ntomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in\r\nlovely and fresh who knows whod be the 1st man Id meet theyre out\r\nlooking for it in the morning Mamy Dillon used to say they are and the\r\nnight too that was her massgoing Id love a big juicy pear now to melt\r\nin your mouth like when I used to be in the longing way then Ill throw\r\nhim up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make his\r\nmouth bigger I suppose hed like my nice cream too I know what Ill do\r\nIll go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa\r\npieta Masetto then Ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son\r\npiu forte Ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good\r\neyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him Ill let him know if\r\nthats what he wanted that his wife is fucked yes and damn well fucked\r\ntoo up to my neck nearly not by him 5 or 6 times handrunning theres the\r\nmark of his spunk on the clean sheet I wouldnt bother to even iron it\r\nout that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly\r\nunless I made him stand there and put him into me Ive a mind to tell\r\nhim every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right\r\nits all his own fault if I am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery\r\nsaid O much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of\r\ntears God knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it I\r\nsuppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or He wouldnt\r\nhave made us the way He did so attractive to men then if he wants to\r\nkiss my bottom Ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his\r\nface as large as life he can stick his tongue 7 miles up my hole as hes\r\nthere my brown part then Ill tell him I want £ 1 or perhaps 30/- Ill\r\ntell him I want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he\r\nwont be too bad I dont want to soak it all out of him like other women\r\ndo I could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write\r\nhis name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it\r\nup besides he wont spend it Ill let him do it off on me behind provided\r\nhe doesnt smear all my good drawers O I suppose that cant be helped Ill\r\ndo the indifferent 1 or 2 questions Ill know by the answers when hes\r\nlike that he cant keep a thing back I know every turn in him Ill\r\ntighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words smellrump or lick\r\nmy shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then Ill suggest\r\nabout yes O wait now sonny my turn is coming Ill be quite gay and\r\nfriendly over it O but I was forgetting this bloody pest of a thing\r\npfooh you wouldnt know which to laugh or cry were such a mixture of\r\nplum and apple no Ill have to wear the old things so much the better\r\nitll be more pointed hell never know whether he did it or not there\r\nthats good enough for you any old thing at all then Ill wipe him off me\r\njust like a business his omission then Ill go out Ill have him eying up\r\nat the ceiling where is she gone now make him want me thats the only\r\nway a quarter after what an unearthly hour I suppose theyre just\r\ngetting up in China now combing out their pigtails for the day well\r\nsoon have the nuns ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming in to spoil\r\ntheir sleep except an odd priest or two for his night office or the\r\nalarmclock next door at cockshout clattering the brains out of itself\r\nlet me see if I can doze off 1 2 3 4 5 what kind of flowers are those\r\nthey invented like the stars the wallpaper in Lombard street was much\r\nnicer the apron he gave me was like that something only I only wore it\r\ntwice better lower this lamp and try again so as I can get up early Ill\r\ngo to Lambes there beside Findlaters and get them to send us some\r\nflowers to put about the place in case he brings him home tomorrow\r\ntoday I mean no no Fridays an unlucky day first I want to do the place\r\nup someway the dust grows in it I think while Im asleep then we can\r\nhave music and cigarettes I can accompany him first I must clean the\r\nkeys of the piano with milk whatll I wear shall I wear a white rose or\r\nthose fairy cakes in Liptons I love the smell of a rich big shop at 7\r\n1/2d a lb or the other ones with the cherries in them and the pinky\r\nsugar 11d a couple of lbs of those a nice plant for the middle of the\r\ntable Id get that cheaper in wait wheres this I saw them not long ago I\r\nlove flowers Id love to have the whole place swimming in roses God of\r\nheaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and\r\nthe waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats\r\nand wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about\r\nthat would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all\r\nsorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the\r\nditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no\r\nGod I wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why\r\ndont they go and create something I often asked him atheists or\r\nwhatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves\r\nfirst then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why\r\nbecause theyre afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes\r\nI know them well who was the first person in the universe before there\r\nwas anybody that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do I so\r\nthere you are they might as well try to stop the sun from rising\r\ntomorrow the sun shines for you he said the day we were lying among the\r\nrhododendrons on Howth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat\r\nthe day I got him to propose to me yes first I gave him the bit of\r\nseedcake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes 16 years ago\r\nmy God after that long kiss I near lost my breath yes he said I was a\r\nflower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that\r\nwas one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today\r\nyes that was why I liked him because I saw he understood or felt what a\r\nwoman is and I knew I could always get round him and I gave him all the\r\npleasure I could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and I\r\nwouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky I was\r\nthinking of so many things he didnt know of Mulvey and Mr Stanhope and\r\nHester and father and old captain Groves and the sailors playing all\r\nbirds fly and I say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the\r\npier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing\r\nround his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the Spanish girls\r\nlaughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the\r\nmorning the Greeks and the jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who\r\nelse from all the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market\r\nall clucking outside Larby Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half\r\nasleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the\r\nsteps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle\r\nthousands of years old yes and those handsome Moors all in white and\r\nturbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop\r\nand Ronda with the old windows of the posadas 2 glancing eyes a lattice\r\nhid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night\r\nand the castanets and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the\r\nwatchman going about serene with his lamp and O that awful deepdown\r\ntorrent O and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the\r\nglorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all\r\nthe queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and\r\nthe rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and\r\nGibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put\r\nthe rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a\r\nred yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well\r\nas well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again\r\nyes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and\r\nfirst I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could\r\nfeel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and\r\nyes I said yes I will Yes.\r\n\r\nTrieste-Zurich-Paris\r\n\r\n1914-1921"
