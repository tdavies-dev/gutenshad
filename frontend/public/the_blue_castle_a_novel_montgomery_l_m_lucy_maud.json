      "content": "If it had not rained on a certain May morning Valancy Stirling’s whole\r\nlife would have been entirely different. She would have gone, with the\r\nrest of her clan, to Aunt Wellington’s engagement picnic and Dr. Trent\r\nwould have gone to Montreal. But it did rain and you shall hear what\r\nhappened to her because of it.\r\n\r\nValancy wakened early, in the lifeless, hopeless hour just preceding\r\ndawn. She had not slept very well. One does not sleep well, sometimes,\r\nwhen one is twenty-nine on the morrow, and unmarried, in a community\r\nand connection where the unmarried are simply those who have failed to\r\nget a man.\r\n\r\nDeerwood and the Stirlings had long since relegated Valancy to hopeless\r\nold maidenhood. But Valancy herself had never quite relinquished a\r\ncertain pitiful, shamed, little hope that Romance would come her way\r\nyet—never, until this wet, horrible morning, when she wakened to the\r\nfact that she was twenty-nine and unsought by any man.\r\n\r\nAy, _there_ lay the sting. Valancy did not mind so much being an old\r\nmaid. After all, she thought, being an old maid couldn’t possibly be as\r\ndreadful as being married to an Uncle Wellington or an Uncle Benjamin,\r\nor even an Uncle Herbert. What hurt her was that she had never had a\r\nchance to be anything but an old maid. No man had ever desired her.\r\n\r\nThe tears came into her eyes as she lay there alone in the faintly\r\ngreying darkness. She dared not let herself cry as hard as she wanted\r\nto, for two reasons. She was afraid that crying might bring on another\r\nattack of that pain around the heart. She had had a spell of it after\r\nshe had got into bed—rather worse than any she had had yet. And she was\r\nafraid her mother would notice her red eyes at breakfast and keep at\r\nher with minute, persistent, mosquito-like questions regarding the\r\ncause thereof.\r\n\r\n“Suppose,” thought Valancy with a ghastly grin, “I answered with the\r\nplain truth, ‘I am crying because I cannot get married.’ How horrified\r\nMother would be—though she is ashamed every day of her life of her old\r\nmaid daughter.”\r\n\r\nBut of course appearances should be kept up. “It is not,” Valancy could\r\nhear her mother’s prim, dictatorial voice asserting, “it is not\r\n_maidenly_ to think about _men_.”\r\n\r\nThe thought of her mother’s expression made Valancy laugh—for she had a\r\nsense of humour nobody in her clan suspected. For that matter, there\r\nwere a good many things about Valancy that nobody suspected. But her\r\nlaughter was very superficial and presently she lay there, a huddled,\r\nfutile little figure, listening to the rain pouring down outside and\r\nwatching, with a sick distaste, the chill, merciless light creeping\r\ninto her ugly, sordid room.\r\n\r\nShe knew the ugliness of that room by heart—knew it and hated it. The\r\nyellow-painted floor, with one hideous, “hooked” rug by the bed, with a\r\ngrotesque, “hooked” dog on it, always grinning at her when she awoke;\r\nthe faded, dark-red paper; the ceiling discoloured by old leaks and\r\ncrossed by cracks; the narrow, pinched little washstand; the\r\nbrown-paper lambrequin with purple roses on it; the spotted old\r\nlooking-glass with the crack across it, propped up on the inadequate\r\ndressing-table; the jar of ancient potpourri made by her mother in her\r\nmythical honeymoon; the shell-covered box, with one burst corner, which\r\nCousin Stickles had made in her equally mythical girlhood; the beaded\r\npincushion with half its bead fringe gone; the one stiff, yellow chair;\r\nthe faded old motto, “Gone but not forgotten,” worked in coloured yarns\r\nabout Great-grandmother Stirling’s grim old face; the old photographs\r\nof ancient relatives long banished from the rooms below. There were\r\nonly two pictures that were not of relatives. One, an old chromo of a\r\npuppy sitting on a rainy doorstep. That picture always made Valancy\r\nunhappy. That forlorn little dog crouched on the doorstep in the\r\ndriving rain! Why didn’t _some one_ open the door and let him in? The\r\nother picture was a faded, passe-partouted engraving of Queen Louise\r\ncoming down a stairway, which Aunt Wellington had lavishly given her on\r\nher tenth birthday. For nineteen years she had looked at it and hated\r\nit, beautiful, smug, self-satisfied Queen Louise. But she never dared\r\ndestroy it or remove it. Mother and Cousin Stickles would have been\r\naghast, or, as Valancy irreverently expressed it in her thoughts, would\r\nhave had a fit.\r\n\r\nEvery room in the house was ugly, of course. But downstairs appearances\r\nwere kept up somewhat. There was no money for rooms nobody ever saw.\r\nValancy sometimes felt that she could have done something for her room\r\nherself, even without money, if she were permitted. But her mother had\r\nnegatived every timid suggestion and Valancy did not persist. Valancy\r\nnever persisted. She was afraid to. Her mother could not brook\r\nopposition. Mrs. Stirling would sulk for days if offended, with the\r\nairs of an insulted duchess.\r\n\r\nThe only thing Valancy liked about her room was that she could be alone\r\nthere at night to cry if she wanted to.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, what did it matter if a room, which you used for\r\nnothing except sleeping and dressing in, were ugly? Valancy was never\r\npermitted to stay alone in her room for any other purpose. People who\r\nwanted to be alone, so Mrs. Frederick Stirling and Cousin Stickles\r\nbelieved, could only want to be alone for some sinister purpose. But\r\nher room in the Blue Castle was everything a room should be.\r\n\r\nValancy, so cowed and subdued and overridden and snubbed in real life,\r\nwas wont to let herself go rather splendidly in her day-dreams. Nobody\r\nin the Stirling clan, or its ramifications, suspected this, least of\r\nall her mother and Cousin Stickles. They never knew that Valancy had\r\ntwo homes—the ugly red brick box of a home, on Elm Street, and the Blue\r\nCastle in Spain. Valancy had lived spiritually in the Blue Castle ever\r\nsince she could remember. She had been a very tiny child when she found\r\nherself possessed of it. Always, when she shut her eyes, she could see\r\nit plainly, with its turrets and banners on the pine-clad mountain\r\nheight, wrapped in its faint, blue loveliness, against the sunset skies\r\nof a fair and unknown land. Everything wonderful and beautiful was in\r\nthat castle. Jewels that queens might have worn; robes of moonlight and\r\nfire; couches of roses and gold; long flights of shallow marble steps,\r\nwith great, white urns, and with slender, mist-clad maidens going up\r\nand down them; courts, marble-pillared, where shimmering fountains fell\r\nand nightingales sang among the myrtles; halls of mirrors that\r\nreflected only handsome knights and lovely women—herself the loveliest\r\nof all, for whose glance men died. All that supported her through the\r\nboredom of her days was the hope of going on a dream spree at night.\r\nMost, if not all, of the Stirlings would have died of horror if they\r\nhad known half the things Valancy did in her Blue Castle.\r\n\r\nFor one thing she had quite a few lovers in it. Oh, only one at a time.\r\nOne who wooed her with all the romantic ardour of the age of chivalry\r\nand won her after long devotion and many deeds of derring-do, and was\r\nwedded to her with pomp and circumstance in the great, banner-hung\r\nchapel of the Blue Castle.\r\n\r\nAt twelve, this lover was a fair lad with golden curls and heavenly\r\nblue eyes. At fifteen, he was tall and dark and pale, but still\r\nnecessarily handsome. At twenty, he was ascetic, dreamy, spiritual. At\r\ntwenty-five, he had a clean-cut jaw, slightly grim, and a face strong\r\nand rugged rather than handsome. Valancy never grew older than\r\ntwenty-five in her Blue Castle, but recently—very recently—her hero had\r\nhad reddish, tawny hair, a twisted smile and a mysterious past.\r\n\r\nI don’t say Valancy deliberately murdered these lovers as she outgrew\r\nthem. One simply faded away as another came. Things are very convenient\r\nin this respect in Blue Castles.\r\n\r\nBut, on this morning of her day of fate, Valancy could not find the key\r\nof her Blue Castle. Reality pressed on her too hardly, barking at her\r\nheels like a maddening little dog. She was twenty-nine, lonely,\r\nundesired, ill-favoured—the only homely girl in a handsome clan, with\r\nno past and no future. As far as she could look back, life was drab and\r\ncolourless, with not one single crimson or purple spot anywhere. As far\r\nas she could look forward it seemed certain to be just the same until\r\nshe was nothing but a solitary, little withered leaf clinging to a\r\nwintry bough. The moment when a woman realises that she has nothing to\r\nlive for—neither love, duty, purpose nor hope—holds for her the\r\nbitterness of death.\r\n\r\n“And I just have to go on living because I can’t stop. I may have to\r\nlive eighty years,” thought Valancy, in a kind of panic. “We’re all\r\nhorribly long-lived. It sickens me to think of it.”\r\n\r\nShe was glad it was raining—or rather, she was drearily satisfied that\r\nit was raining. There would be no picnic that day. This annual picnic,\r\nwhereby Aunt and Uncle Wellington—one always thought of them in that\r\nsuccession—inevitably celebrated their engagement at a picnic thirty\r\nyears before, had been, of late years, a veritable nightmare to\r\nValancy. By an impish coincidence it was the same day as her birthday\r\nand, after she had passed twenty-five, nobody let her forget it.\r\n\r\nMuch as she hated going to the picnic, it would never have occurred to\r\nher to rebel against it. There seemed to be nothing of the\r\nrevolutionary in her nature. And she knew exactly what every one would\r\nsay to her at the picnic. Uncle Wellington, whom she disliked and\r\ndespised even though he had fulfilled the highest Stirling aspiration,\r\n“marrying money,” would say to her in a pig’s whisper, “Not thinking of\r\ngetting married yet, my dear?” and then go off into the bellow of\r\nlaughter with which he invariably concluded his dull remarks. Aunt\r\nWellington, of whom Valancy stood in abject awe, would tell her about\r\nOlive’s new chiffon dress and Cecil’s last devoted letter. Valancy\r\nwould have to look as pleased and interested as if the dress and letter\r\nhad been hers or else Aunt Wellington would be offended. And Valancy\r\nhad long ago decided that she would rather offend God than Aunt\r\nWellington, because God might forgive her but Aunt Wellington never\r\nwould.\r\n\r\nAunt Alberta, enormously fat, with an amiable habit of always referring\r\nto her husband as “he,” as if he were the only male creature in the\r\nworld, who could never forget that she had been a great beauty in her\r\nyouth, would condole with Valancy on her sallow skin—\r\n\r\n“I don’t know why all the girls of today are so sunburned. When _I_ was\r\na girl my skin was roses and cream. I was counted the prettiest girl in\r\nCanada, my dear.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps Uncle Herbert wouldn’t say anything—or perhaps he would remark\r\njocularly, “How fat you’re getting, Doss!” And then everybody would\r\nlaugh over the excessively humorous idea of poor, scrawny little Doss\r\ngetting fat.\r\n\r\nHandsome, solemn Uncle James, whom Valancy disliked but respected\r\nbecause he was reputed to be very clever and was therefore the clan\r\noracle—brains being none too plentiful in the Stirling connection—would\r\nprobably remark with the owl-like sarcasm that had won him his\r\nreputation, “I suppose you’re busy with your hope-chest these days?”\r\n\r\nAnd Uncle Benjamin would ask some of his abominable conundrums, between\r\nwheezy chuckles, and answer them himself.\r\n\r\n“What is the difference between Doss and a mouse?\r\n\r\n“The mouse wishes to harm the cheese and Doss wishes to charm the\r\nhe’s.”\r\n\r\nValancy had heard him ask that riddle fifty times and every time she\r\nwanted to throw something at him. But she never did. In the first\r\nplace, the Stirlings simply did not throw things; in the second place,\r\nUncle Benjamin was a wealthy and childless old widower and Valancy had\r\nbeen brought up in the fear and admonition of his money. If she\r\noffended him he would cut her out of his will—supposing she were in it.\r\nValancy did not want to be cut out of Uncle Benjamin’s will. She had\r\nbeen poor all her life and knew the galling bitterness of it. So she\r\nendured his riddles and even smiled tortured little smiles over them.\r\n\r\nAunt Isabel, downright and disagreeable as an east wind, would\r\ncriticise her in some way—Valancy could not predict just how, for Aunt\r\nIsabel never repeated a criticism—she found something new with which to\r\njab you every time. Aunt Isabel prided herself on saying what she\r\nthought, but didn’t like it so well when other people said what _they_\r\nthought to _her_. Valancy never said what _she_ thought.\r\n\r\nCousin Georgiana—named after her great-great-grandmother, who had been\r\nnamed after George the Fourth—would recount dolorously the names of all\r\nrelatives and friends who had died since the last picnic and wonder\r\n“which of us will be the first to go next.”\r\n\r\nOppressively competent, Aunt Mildred would talk endlessly of her\r\nhusband and her odious prodigies of babies to Valancy, because Valancy\r\nwould be the only one she could find to put up with it. For the same\r\nreason, Cousin Gladys—really First Cousin Gladys once removed,\r\naccording to the strict way in which the Stirlings tabulated\r\nrelationship—a tall, thin lady who admitted she had a sensitive\r\ndisposition, would describe minutely the tortures of her neuritis. And\r\nOlive, the wonder girl of the whole Stirling clan, who had everything\r\nValancy had not—beauty, popularity, love,—would show off her beauty and\r\npresume on her popularity and flaunt her diamond insignia of love in\r\nValancy’s dazzled, envious eyes.\r\n\r\nThere would be none of all this today. And there would be no packing up\r\nof teaspoons. The packing up was always left for Valancy and Cousin\r\nStickles. And once, six years ago, a silver teaspoon from Aunt\r\nWellington’s wedding set had been lost. Valancy never heard the last of\r\nthat silver teaspoon. Its ghost appeared Banquo-like at every\r\nsubsequent family feast.\r\n\r\nOh, yes, Valancy knew exactly what the picnic would be like and she\r\nblessed the rain that had saved her from it. There would be no picnic\r\nthis year. If Aunt Wellington could not celebrate on the sacred day\r\nitself she would have no celebration at all. Thank whatever gods there\r\nwere for that.\r\n\r\nSince there would be no picnic, Valancy made up her mind that, if the\r\nrain held up in the afternoon, she would go up to the library and get\r\nanother of John Foster’s books. Valancy was never allowed to read\r\nnovels, but John Foster’s books were not novels. They were “nature\r\nbooks”—so the librarian told Mrs. Frederick Stirling—“all about the\r\nwoods and birds and bugs and things like that, you know.” So Valancy\r\nwas allowed to read them—under protest, for it was only too evident\r\nthat she enjoyed them too much. It was permissible, even laudable, to\r\nread to improve your mind and your religion, but a book that was\r\nenjoyable was dangerous. Valancy did not know whether her mind was\r\nbeing improved or not; but she felt vaguely that if she had come across\r\nJohn Foster’s books years ago life might have been a different thing\r\nfor her. They seemed to her to yield glimpses of a world into which she\r\nmight once have entered, though the door was forever barred to her now.\r\nIt was only within the last year that John Foster’s books had been in\r\nthe Deerwood library, though the librarian told Valancy that he had\r\nbeen a well-known writer for several years.\r\n\r\n“Where does he live?” Valancy had asked.\r\n\r\n“Nobody knows. From his books he must be a Canadian, but no more\r\ninformation can be had. His publishers won’t say a word. Quite likely\r\nJohn Foster is a nom de plume. His books are so popular we can’t keep\r\nthem in at all, though I really can’t see what people find in them to\r\nrave over.”\r\n\r\n“I think they’re wonderful,” said Valancy, timidly.\r\n\r\n“Oh—well—” Miss Clarkson smiled in a patronising fashion that relegated\r\nValancy’s opinions to limbo, “I can’t say I care much for bugs myself.\r\nBut certainly Foster seems to know all there is to know about them.”\r\n\r\nValancy didn’t know whether she cared much for bugs either. It was not\r\nJohn Foster’s uncanny knowledge of wild creatures and insect life that\r\nenthralled her. She could hardly say what it was—some tantalising lure\r\nof a mystery never revealed—some hint of a great secret just a little\r\nfurther on—some faint, elusive echo of lovely, forgotten things—John\r\nFoster’s magic was indefinable.\r\n\r\nYes, she would get a new Foster book. It was a month since she had\r\n_Thistle Harvest_, so surely Mother could not object. Valancy had read\r\nit four times—she knew whole passages off by heart.\r\n\r\nAnd—she almost thought she would go and see Dr. Trent about that queer\r\npain around the heart. It had come rather often lately, and the\r\npalpitations were becoming annoying, not to speak of an occasional\r\ndizzy moment and a queer shortness of breath. But could she go to see\r\nhim without telling any one? It was a most daring thought. None of the\r\nStirlings ever consulted a doctor without holding a family council and\r\ngetting Uncle James’ approval. _Then_, they went to Dr. Ambrose Marsh\r\nof Port Lawrence, who had married Second Cousin Adelaide Stirling.\r\n\r\nBut Valancy disliked Dr. Ambrose Marsh. And, besides, she could not get\r\nto Port Lawrence, fifteen miles away, without being taken there. She\r\ndid not want any one to know about her heart. There would be such a\r\nfuss made and every member of the family would come down and talk it\r\nover and advise her and caution her and warn her and tell her horrible\r\ntales of great-aunts and cousins forty times removed who had been “just\r\nlike that” and “dropped dead without a moment’s warning, my dear.”\r\n\r\nAunt Isabel would remember that she had always said Doss looked like a\r\ngirl who would have heart trouble—“so pinched and peaked always”; and\r\nUncle Wellington would take it as a personal insult, when “no Stirling\r\never had heart disease before”; and Georgiana would forebode in\r\nperfectly audible asides that “poor, dear little Doss isn’t long for\r\nthis world, I’m afraid”; and Cousin Gladys would say, “Why, _my_ heart\r\nhas been like that for _years_,” in a tone that implied no one else had\r\nany business even to have a heart; and Olive—Olive would merely look\r\nbeautiful and superior and disgustingly healthy, as if to say, “Why all\r\nthis fuss over a faded superfluity like Doss when you have _me_?”\r\n\r\nValancy felt that she couldn’t tell anybody unless she had to. She felt\r\nquite sure there was nothing at all seriously wrong with her heart and\r\nno need of all the pother that would ensue if she mentioned it. She\r\nwould just slip up quietly and see Dr. Trent that very day. As for his\r\nbill, she had the two hundred dollars that her father had put in the\r\nbank for her the day she was born. She was never allowed to use even\r\nthe interest of this, but she would secretly take out enough to pay Dr.\r\nTrent.\r\n\r\nDr. Trent was a gruff, outspoken, absent-minded old fellow, but he was\r\na recognised authority on heart disease, even if he were only a general\r\npractitioner in out-of-the-world Deerwood. Dr. Trent was over seventy\r\nand there had been rumours that he meant to retire soon. None of the\r\nStirling clan had ever gone to him since he had told Cousin Gladys, ten\r\nyears before, that her neuritis was all imaginary and that she enjoyed\r\nit. You couldn’t patronise a doctor who insulted your\r\nfirst-cousin-once-removed like that—not to mention that he was a\r\nPresbyterian when all the Stirlings went to the Anglican church. But\r\nValancy, between the devil of disloyalty to clan and the deep sea of\r\nfuss and clatter and advice, thought she would take a chance with the\r\ndevil."

      "content": "When Cousin Stickles knocked at her door, Valancy knew it was half-past\r\nseven and she must get up. As long as she could remember, Cousin\r\nStickles had knocked at her door at half-past seven. Cousin Stickles\r\nand Mrs. Frederick Stirling had been up since seven, but Valancy was\r\nallowed to lie abed half an hour longer because of a family tradition\r\nthat she was delicate. Valancy got up, though she hated getting up more\r\nthis morning than ever she had before. What was there to get up for?\r\nAnother dreary day like all the days that had preceded it, full of\r\nmeaningless little tasks, joyless and unimportant, that benefited\r\nnobody. But if she did not get up at once she would not be ready for\r\nbreakfast at eight o’clock. Hard and fast times for meals were the rule\r\nin Mrs. Stirling’s household. Breakfast at eight, dinner at one, supper\r\nat six, year in and year out. No excuses for being late were ever\r\ntolerated. So up Valancy got, shivering.\r\n\r\nThe room was bitterly cold with the raw, penetrating chill of a wet May\r\nmorning. The house would be cold all day. It was one of Mrs.\r\nFrederick’s rules that no fires were necessary after the twenty-fourth\r\nof May. Meals were cooked on the little oil-stove in the back porch.\r\nAnd though May might be icy and October frost-bitten, no fires were\r\nlighted until the twenty-first of October by the calendar. On the\r\ntwenty-first of October Mrs. Frederick began cooking over the kitchen\r\nrange and lighted a fire in the sitting-room stove in the evenings. It\r\nwas whispered about in the connection that the late Frederick Stirling\r\nhad caught the cold which resulted in his death during Valancy’s first\r\nyear of life because Mrs. Frederick would not have a fire on the\r\ntwentieth of October. She lighted it the next day—but that was a day\r\ntoo late for Frederick Stirling.\r\n\r\nValancy took off and hung up in the closet her nightdress of coarse,\r\nunbleached cotton, with high neck and long, tight sleeves. She put on\r\nundergarments of a similar nature, a dress of brown gingham, thick,\r\nblack stockings and rubber-heeled boots. Of late years she had fallen\r\ninto the habit of doing her hair with the shade of the window by the\r\nlooking-glass pulled down. The lines on her face did not show so\r\nplainly then. But this morning she jerked the shade to the very top and\r\nlooked at herself in the leprous mirror with a passionate determination\r\nto see herself as the world saw her.\r\n\r\nThe result was rather dreadful. Even a beauty would have found that\r\nharsh, unsoftened side-light trying. Valancy saw straight black hair,\r\nshort and thin, always lustreless despite the fact that she gave it one\r\nhundred strokes of the brush, neither more nor less, every night of her\r\nlife and faithfully rubbed Redfern’s Hair Vigor into the roots, more\r\nlustreless than ever in its morning roughness; fine, straight, black\r\nbrows; a nose she had always felt was much too small even for her\r\nsmall, three-cornered, white face; a small, pale mouth that always fell\r\nopen a trifle over little, pointed white teeth; a figure thin and\r\nflat-breasted, rather below the average height. She had somehow escaped\r\nthe family high cheek-bones, and her dark-brown eyes, too soft and\r\nshadowy to be black, had a slant that was almost Oriental. Apart from\r\nher eyes she was neither pretty nor ugly—just insignificant-looking,\r\nshe concluded bitterly. How plain the lines around her eyes and mouth\r\nwere in that merciless light! And never had her narrow, white face\r\nlooked so narrow and so white.\r\n\r\nShe did her hair in a pompadour. Pompadours had long gone out of\r\nfashion, but they had been in when Valancy first put her hair up and\r\nAunt Wellington had decided that she must always wear her hair so.\r\n\r\n“It is the _only_ way that becomes you. Your face is so small that you\r\n_must_ add height to it by a pompadour effect,” said Aunt Wellington,\r\nwho always enunciated commonplaces as if uttering profound and\r\nimportant truths.\r\n\r\nValancy had hankered to do her hair pulled low on her forehead, with\r\npuffs above the ears, as Olive was wearing hers. But Aunt Wellington’s\r\ndictum had such an effect on her that she never dared change her style\r\nof hairdressing again. But then, there were so many things Valancy\r\nnever dared do.\r\n\r\nAll her life she had been afraid of something, she thought bitterly.\r\nFrom the very dawn of recollection, when she had been so horribly\r\nafraid of the big black bear that lived, so Cousin Stickles told her,\r\nin the closet under the stairs.\r\n\r\n“And I always will be—I know it—I can’t help it. I don’t know what it\r\nwould be like not to be afraid of something.”\r\n\r\nAfraid of her mother’s sulky fits—afraid of offending Uncle\r\nBenjamin—afraid of becoming a target for Aunt Wellington’s\r\ncontempt—afraid of Aunt Isabel’s biting comments—afraid of Uncle James’\r\ndisapproval—afraid of offending the whole clan’s opinions and\r\nprejudices—afraid of not keeping up appearances—afraid to say what she\r\nreally thought of anything—afraid of poverty in her old age.\r\nFear—fear—fear—she could never escape from it. It bound her and\r\nenmeshed her like a spider’s web of steel. Only in her Blue Castle\r\ncould she find temporary release. And this morning Valancy could not\r\nbelieve she had a Blue Castle. She would never be able to find it\r\nagain. Twenty-nine, unmarried, undesired—what had she to do with the\r\nfairy-like chatelaine of the Blue Castle? She would cut such childish\r\nnonsense out of her life forever and face reality unflinchingly.\r\n\r\nShe turned from her unfriendly mirror and looked out. The ugliness of\r\nthe view always struck her like a blow; the ragged fence, the\r\ntumble-down old carriage-shop in the next lot, plastered with crude,\r\nviolently coloured advertisements; the grimy railway station beyond,\r\nwith the awful derelicts that were always hanging around it even at\r\nthis early hour. In the pouring rain everything looked worse than\r\nusual, especially the beastly advertisement, “Keep that schoolgirl\r\ncomplexion.” Valancy _had_ kept her schoolgirl complexion. That was\r\njust the trouble. There was not a gleam of beauty anywhere—“exactly\r\nlike my life,” thought Valancy drearily. Her brief bitterness had\r\npassed. She accepted facts as resignedly as she had always accepted\r\nthem. She was one of the people whom life always passes by. There was\r\nno altering that fact.\r\n\r\nIn this mood Valancy went down to breakfast."

      "content": "Breakfast was always the same. Oatmeal porridge, which Valancy loathed,\r\ntoast and tea, and one teaspoonful of marmalade. Mrs. Frederick thought\r\ntwo teaspoonfuls extravagant—but that did not matter to Valancy, who\r\nhated marmalade, too. The chilly, gloomy little dining-room was\r\nchillier and gloomier than usual; the rain streamed down outside the\r\nwindow; departed Stirlings, in atrocious, gilt frames, wider than the\r\npictures, glowered down from the walls. And yet Cousin Stickles wished\r\nValancy many happy returns of the day!\r\n\r\n“Sit up straight, Doss,” was all her mother said.\r\n\r\nValancy sat up straight. She talked to her mother and Cousin Stickles\r\nof the things they always talked of. She never wondered what would\r\nhappen if she tried to talk of something else. She knew. Therefore she\r\nnever did it.\r\n\r\nMrs. Frederick was offended with Providence for sending a rainy day\r\nwhen she wanted to go to a picnic, so she ate her breakfast in a sulky\r\nsilence for which Valancy was rather grateful. But Christine Stickles\r\nwhined endlessly on as usual, complaining about everything—the weather,\r\nthe leak in the pantry, the price of oatmeal and butter—Valancy felt at\r\nonce she had buttered her toast too lavishly—the epidemic of mumps in\r\nDeerwood.\r\n\r\n“Doss will be sure to ketch them,” she foreboded.\r\n\r\n“Doss must not go where she is likely to catch mumps,” said Mrs.\r\nFrederick shortly.\r\n\r\nValancy had never had mumps—or whooping cough—or chicken-pox—or\r\nmeasles—or anything she should have had—nothing but horrible colds\r\nevery winter. Doss’ winter colds were a sort of tradition in the\r\nfamily. Nothing, it seemed, could prevent her from catching them. Mrs.\r\nFrederick and Cousin Stickles did their heroic best. One winter they\r\nkept Valancy housed up from November to May, in the warm sitting-room.\r\nShe was not even allowed to go to church. And Valancy took cold after\r\ncold and ended up with bronchitis in June.\r\n\r\n“None of _my_ family were ever like that,” said Mrs. Frederick,\r\nimplying that it must be a Stirling tendency.\r\n\r\n“The Stirlings seldom take colds,” said Cousin Stickles resentfully.\r\n_She_ had been a Stirling.\r\n\r\n“I think,” said Mrs. Frederick, “that if a person makes up her mind\r\n_not_ to have colds she will not _have_ colds.”\r\n\r\nSo that was the trouble. It was all Valancy’s own fault.\r\n\r\nBut on this particular morning Valancy’s unbearable grievance was that\r\nshe was called Doss. She had endured it for twenty-nine years, and all\r\nat once she felt she could not endure it any longer. Her full name was\r\nValancy Jane. Valancy Jane was rather terrible, but she liked Valancy,\r\nwith its odd, out-land tang. It was always a wonder to Valancy that the\r\nStirlings had allowed her to be so christened. She had been told that\r\nher maternal grandfather, old Amos Wansbarra, had chosen the name for\r\nher. Her father had tacked on the Jane by way of civilising it, and the\r\nwhole connection got out of the difficulty by nicknaming her Doss. She\r\nnever got Valancy from any one but outsiders.\r\n\r\n“Mother,” she said timidly, “would you mind calling me Valancy after\r\nthis? Doss seems so—so—I don’t like it.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Frederick looked at her daughter in astonishment. She wore glasses\r\nwith enormously strong lenses that gave her eyes a peculiarly\r\ndisagreeable appearance.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter with Doss?”\r\n\r\n“It—seems so childish,” faltered Valancy.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” Mrs. Frederick had been a Wansbarra and the Wansbarra smile was\r\nnot an asset. “I see. Well, it should suit _you_ then. You are childish\r\nenough in all conscience, my dear child.”\r\n\r\n“I am twenty-nine,” said the dear child desperately.\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t proclaim it from the house-tops if I were you, dear,” said\r\nMrs. Frederick. “Twenty-nine! _I_ had been married nine years when I\r\nwas twenty-nine.”\r\n\r\n“_I_ was married at seventeen,” said Cousin Stickles proudly.\r\n\r\nValancy looked at them furtively. Mrs. Frederick, except for those\r\nterrible glasses and the hooked nose that made her look more like a\r\nparrot than a parrot itself could look, was not ill-looking. At twenty\r\nshe might have been quite pretty. But Cousin Stickles! And yet\r\nChristine Stickles had once been desirable in some man’s eyes. Valancy\r\nfelt that Cousin Stickles, with her broad, flat, wrinkled face, a mole\r\nright on the end of her dumpy nose, bristling hairs on her chin,\r\nwrinkled yellow neck, pale, protruding eyes, and thin, puckered mouth,\r\nhad yet this advantage over her—this right to look down on her. And\r\neven yet Cousin Stickles was necessary to Mrs. Frederick. Valancy\r\nwondered pitifully what it would be like to be wanted by some\r\none—needed by some one. No one in the whole world needed her, or would\r\nmiss anything from life if she dropped suddenly out of it. She was a\r\ndisappointment to her mother. No one loved her. She had never so much\r\nas had a girl friend.\r\n\r\n“I haven’t even a gift for friendship,” she had once admitted to\r\nherself pitifully.\r\n\r\n“Doss, you haven’t eaten your crusts,” said Mrs. Frederick rebukingly.\r\n\r\nIt rained all the forenoon without cessation. Valancy pieced a quilt.\r\nValancy hated piecing quilts. And there was no need of it. The house\r\nwas full of quilts. There were three big chests, packed with quilts, in\r\nthe attic. Mrs. Frederick had begun storing away quilts when Valancy\r\nwas seventeen and she kept on storing them, though it did not seem\r\nlikely that Valancy would ever need them. But Valancy must be at work\r\nand fancy work materials were too expensive. Idleness was a cardinal\r\nsin in the Stirling household. When Valancy had been a child she had\r\nbeen made to write down every night, in a small, hated, black notebook,\r\nall the minutes she had spent in idleness that day. On Sundays her\r\nmother made her tot them up and pray over them.\r\n\r\nOn this particular forenoon of this day of destiny Valancy spent only\r\nten minutes in idleness. At least, Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles\r\nwould have called it idleness. She went to her room to get a better\r\nthimble and she opened _Thistle Harvest_ guiltily at random.\r\n\r\n“The woods are so human,” wrote John Foster, “that to know them one\r\nmust live with them. An occasional saunter through them, keeping to the\r\nwell-trodden paths, will never admit us to their intimacy. If we wish\r\nto be friends we must seek them out and win them by frequent, reverent\r\nvisits at all hours; by morning, by noon, and by night; and at all\r\nseasons, in spring, in summer, in autumn, in winter. Otherwise we can\r\nnever really know them and any pretence we may make to the contrary\r\nwill never impose on them. They have their own effective way of keeping\r\naliens at a distance and shutting their hearts to mere casual\r\nsightseers. It is of no use to seek the woods from any motive except\r\nsheer love of them; they will find us out at once and hide all their\r\nsweet, old-world secrets from us. But if they know we come to them\r\nbecause we love them they will be very kind to us and give us such\r\ntreasures of beauty and delight as are not bought or sold in any\r\nmarket-place. For the woods, when they give at all, give unstintedly\r\nand hold nothing back from their true worshippers. We must go to them\r\nlovingly, humbly, patiently, watchfully, and we shall learn what\r\npoignant loveliness lurks in the wild places and silent intervales,\r\nlying under starshine and sunset, what cadences of unearthly music are\r\nharped on aged pine boughs or crooned in copses of fir, what delicate\r\nsavours exhale from mosses and ferns in sunny corners or on damp\r\nbrooklands, what dreams and myths and legends of an older time haunt\r\nthem. Then the immortal heart of the woods will beat against ours and\r\nits subtle life will steal into our veins and make us its own forever,\r\nso that no matter where we go or how widely we wander we shall yet be\r\ndrawn back to the forest to find our most enduring kinship.”\r\n\r\n“Doss,” called her mother from the hall below, “what are you doing all\r\nby yourself in that room?”\r\n\r\nValancy dropped _Thistle Harvest_ like a hot coal and fled downstairs\r\nto her patches; but she felt the strange exhilaration of spirit that\r\nalways came momentarily to her when she dipped into one of John\r\nFoster’s books. Valancy did not know much about woods—except the\r\nhaunted groves of oak and pine around her Blue Castle. But she had\r\nalways secretly hankered after them and a Foster book about woods was\r\nthe next best thing to the woods themselves.\r\n\r\nAt noon it stopped raining, but the sun did not come out until three.\r\nThen Valancy timidly said she thought she would go uptown.\r\n\r\n“What do you want to go uptown for?” demanded her mother.\r\n\r\n“I want to get a book from the library.”\r\n\r\n“You got a book from the library only last week.”\r\n\r\n“No, it was four weeks.”\r\n\r\n“Four weeks. Nonsense!”\r\n\r\n“Really it was, Mother.”\r\n\r\n“You are mistaken. It cannot possibly have been more than two weeks. I\r\ndislike contradiction. And I do not see what you want to get a book\r\nfor, anyhow. You waste too much time reading.”\r\n\r\n“Of what value is my time?” asked Valancy bitterly.\r\n\r\n“Doss! Don’t speak in that tone to _me_.”\r\n\r\n“We need some tea,” said Cousin Stickles. “She might go and get that if\r\nshe wants a walk—though this damp weather is bad for colds.”\r\n\r\nThey argued the matter for ten minutes longer and finally Mrs.\r\nFrederick agreed rather grudgingly that Valancy might go."

      "content": "“Got your rubbers on?” called Cousin Stickles, as Valancy left the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nChristine Stickles had never once forgotten to ask that question when\r\nValancy went out on a damp day.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Have you got your flannel petticoat on?” asked Mrs. Frederick.\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Doss, I really do not understand you. Do you want to catch your death\r\nof cold _again_?” Her voice implied that Valancy had died of a cold\r\nseveral times already. “Go upstairs this minute and put it on!”\r\n\r\n“Mother, I don’t _need_ a flannel petticoat. My sateen one is warm\r\nenough.”\r\n\r\n“Doss, remember you had bronchitis two years ago. Go and do as you are\r\ntold!”\r\n\r\nValancy went, though nobody will ever know just how near she came to\r\nhurling the rubber-plant into the street before she went. She hated\r\nthat grey flannel petticoat more than any other garment she owned.\r\nOlive never had to wear flannel petticoats. Olive wore ruffled silk and\r\nsheer lawn and filmy laced flounces. But Olive’s father had “married\r\nmoney” and Olive never had bronchitis. So there you were.\r\n\r\n“Are you sure you didn’t leave the soap in the water?” demanded Mrs.\r\nFrederick. But Valancy was gone. She turned at the corner and looked\r\nback down the ugly, prim, respectable street where she lived. The\r\nStirling house was the ugliest on it—more like a red brick box than\r\nanything else. Too high for its breadth, and made still higher by a\r\nbulbous glass cupola on top. About it was the desolate, barren peace of\r\nan old house whose life is lived.\r\n\r\nThere was a very pretty little house, with leaded casements and dubbed\r\ngables, just around the corner—a new house, one of those houses you\r\nlove the minute you see them. Clayton Markley had built it for his\r\nbride. He was to be married to Jennie Lloyd in June. The little house,\r\nit was said, was furnished from attic to cellar, in complete readiness\r\nfor its mistress.\r\n\r\n“I don’t envy Jennie the man,” thought Valancy sincerely—Clayton\r\nMarkley was not one of her many ideals—“but I _do_ envy her the house.\r\nIt’s such a nice young house. Oh, if I could only have a house of my\r\nown—ever so poor, so tiny—but my own! But then,” she added bitterly,\r\n“there is no use in yowling for the moon when you can’t even get a\r\ntallow candle.”\r\n\r\nIn dreamland nothing would do Valancy but a castle of pale sapphire. In\r\nreal life she would have been fully satisfied with a little house of\r\nher own. She envied Jennie Lloyd more fiercely than ever today. Jennie\r\nwas not so much better looking than she was, and not so very much\r\nyounger. Yet she was to have this delightful house. And the nicest\r\nlittle Wedgwood teacups—Valancy had seen them; an open fireplace, and\r\nmonogrammed linen; hemstitched tablecloths, and china-closets. Why did\r\n_everything_ come to some girls and _nothing_ to others? It wasn’t\r\nfair.\r\n\r\nValancy was once more seething with rebellion as she walked along, a\r\nprim, dowdy little figure in her shabby raincoat and three-year-old\r\nhat, splashed occasionally by the mud of a passing motor with its\r\ninsulting shrieks. Motors were still rather a novelty in Deerwood,\r\nthough they were common in Port Lawrence, and most of the summer\r\nresidents up at Muskoka had them. In Deerwood only some of the smart\r\nset had them; for even Deerwood was divided into sets. There was the\r\nsmart set—the intellectual set—the old-family set—of which the\r\nStirlings were members—the common run, and a few pariahs. Not one of\r\nthe Stirling clan had as yet condescended to a motor, though Olive was\r\nteasing her father to have one. Valancy had never even been in a\r\nmotorcar. But she did not hanker after this. In truth, she felt rather\r\nafraid of motorcars, especially at night. They seemed to be too much\r\nlike big purring beasts that might turn and crush you—or make some\r\nterrible savage leap somewhere. On the steep mountain trails around her\r\nBlue Castle only gaily caparisoned steeds might proudly pace; in real\r\nlife Valancy would have been quite contented to drive in a buggy behind\r\na nice horse. She got a buggy drive only when some uncle or cousin\r\nremembered to fling her “a chance,” like a bone to a dog."

      "content": "Of course she must buy the tea in Uncle Benjamin’s grocery-store. To\r\nbuy it anywhere else was unthinkable. Yet Valancy hated to go to Uncle\r\nBenjamin’s store on her twenty-ninth birthday. There was no hope that\r\nhe would not remember it.\r\n\r\n“Why,” demanded Uncle Benjamin, leeringly, as he tied up her tea, “are\r\nyoung ladies like bad grammarians?”\r\n\r\nValancy, with Uncle Benjamin’s will in the background of her mind, said\r\nmeekly, “I don’t know. Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because,” chuckled Uncle Benjamin, “they can’t decline matrimony.”\r\n\r\nThe two clerks, Joe Hammond and Claude Bertram, chuckled also, and\r\nValancy disliked them a little more than ever. On the first day Claude\r\nBertram had seen her in the store she had heard him whisper to Joe,\r\n“Who is that?” And Joe had said, “Valancy Stirling—one of the Deerwood\r\nold maids.” “Curable or incurable?” Claude had asked with a snicker,\r\nevidently thinking the question very clever. Valancy smarted anew with\r\nthe sting of that old recollection.\r\n\r\n“Twenty-nine,” Uncle Benjamin was saying. “Dear me, Doss, you’re\r\ndangerously near the second corner and not even thinking of getting\r\nmarried yet. Twenty-nine. It seems impossible.”\r\n\r\nThen Uncle Benjamin said an original thing. Uncle Benjamin said, “How\r\ntime does fly!”\r\n\r\n“_I_ think it _crawls_,” said Valancy passionately. Passion was so\r\nalien to Uncle Benjamin’s conception of Valancy that he didn’t know\r\nwhat to make of her. To cover his confusion, he asked another conundrum\r\nas he tied up her beans—Cousin Stickles had remembered at the last\r\nmoment that they must have beans. Beans were cheap and filling.\r\n\r\n“What two ages are apt to prove illusory?” asked Uncle Benjamin; and,\r\nnot waiting for Valancy to “give it up,” he added, “Mir-age and\r\nmarri-age.”\r\n\r\n“M-i-r-a-g-e is pronounced _mirazh_,” said Valancy shortly, picking up\r\nher tea and her beans. For the moment she did not care whether Uncle\r\nBenjamin cut her out of his will or not. She walked out of the store\r\nwhile Uncle Benjamin stared after her with his mouth open. Then he\r\nshook his head.\r\n\r\n“Poor Doss is taking it hard,” he said.\r\n\r\nValancy was sorry by the time she reached the next crossing. Why had\r\nshe lost her patience like that? Uncle Benjamin would be annoyed and\r\nwould likely tell her mother that Doss had been impertinent—“to\r\n_me_!”—and her mother would lecture her for a week.\r\n\r\n“I’ve held my tongue for twenty years,” thought Valancy. “Why couldn’t\r\nI have held it once more?”\r\n\r\nYes, it was just twenty, Valancy reflected, since she had first been\r\ntwitted with her loverless condition. She remembered the bitter moment\r\nperfectly. She was just nine years old and she was standing alone on\r\nthe school playground while the other little girls of her class were\r\nplaying a game in which you must be chosen by a boy as his partner\r\nbefore you could play. Nobody had chosen Valancy—little, pale,\r\nblack-haired Valancy, with her prim, long-sleeved apron and odd,\r\nslanted eyes.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said a pretty little girl to her, “I’m so sorry for you. You\r\nhaven’t got a beau.”\r\n\r\nValancy had said defiantly, as she continued to say for twenty years,\r\n“I don’t _want_ a beau.” But this afternoon Valancy once and for all\r\nstopped saying that.\r\n\r\n“I’m going to be honest with myself anyhow,” she thought savagely.\r\n“Uncle Benjamin’s riddles hurt me because they are true. I _do_ want to\r\nbe married. I want a house of my own—I want a husband of my own—I want\r\nsweet, little fat _babies_ of my own—” Valancy stopped suddenly aghast\r\nat her own recklessness. She felt sure that Rev. Dr. Stalling, who\r\npassed her at this moment, read her thoughts and disapproved of them\r\nthoroughly. Valancy was afraid of Dr. Stalling—had been afraid of him\r\never since the Sunday, twenty-three years before, when he had first\r\ncome to St. Albans’. Valancy had been too late for Sunday School that\r\nday and she had gone into the church timidly and sat in their pew. No\r\none else was in the church—nobody except the new rector, Dr. Stalling.\r\nDr. Stalling stood up in front of the choir door, beckoned to her, and\r\nsaid sternly, “Little boy, come up here.”\r\n\r\nValancy had stared around her. There was no little boy—there was no one\r\nin all the huge church but herself. This strange man with the blue\r\nglasses couldn’t mean her. She was not a boy.\r\n\r\n“Little boy,” repeated Dr. Stalling, more sternly still, shaking his\r\nforefinger fiercely at her, “come up here at once!”\r\n\r\nValancy arose as if hypnotised and walked up the aisle. She was too\r\nterrified to do anything else. What dreadful thing was going to happen\r\nto her? What _had_ happened to her? Had she actually turned into a boy?\r\nShe came to a stop in front of Dr. Stalling. Dr. Stalling shook his\r\nforefinger—such a long, knuckly forefinger—at her and said:\r\n\r\n“Little boy, take off your hat.”\r\n\r\nValancy took off her hat. She had a scrawny little pigtail hanging down\r\nher back, but Dr. Stalling was shortsighted and did not perceive it.\r\n\r\n“Little boy, go back to your seat and _always_ take off your hat in\r\nchurch. _Remember!_”\r\n\r\nValancy went back to her seat carrying her hat like an automaton.\r\nPresently her mother came in.\r\n\r\n“Doss,” said Mrs. Stirling, “what do you mean by taking off your hat?\r\nPut it on instantly!”\r\n\r\nValancy put it on instantly. She was cold with fear lest Dr. Stalling\r\nshould immediately summon her up front again. She would have to go, of\r\ncourse—it never occurred to her that one could disobey the rector—and\r\nthe church was full of people now. Oh, what would she do if that\r\nhorrible, stabbing forefinger were shaken at her again before all those\r\npeople? Valancy sat through the whole service in an agony of dread and\r\nwas sick for a week afterwards. Nobody knew why—Mrs. Frederick again\r\nbemoaned herself of her delicate child.\r\n\r\nDr. Stalling found out his mistake and laughed over it to Valancy—who\r\ndid not laugh. She never got over her dread of Dr. Stalling. And now to\r\nbe caught by him on the street corner, thinking such things!\r\n\r\nValancy got her John Foster book—_Magic of Wings_. “His latest—all\r\nabout birds,” said Miss Clarkson. She had almost decided that she would\r\ngo home, instead of going to see Dr. Trent. Her courage had failed her.\r\nShe was afraid of offending Uncle James—afraid of angering her\r\nmother—afraid of facing gruff, shaggy-browed old Dr. Trent, who would\r\nprobably tell her, as he had told Cousin Gladys, that her trouble was\r\nentirely imaginary and that she only had it because she liked to have\r\nit. No, she would not go; she would get a bottle of Redfern’s Purple\r\nPills instead. Redfern’s Purple Pills were the standard medicine of the\r\nStirling clan. Had they not cured Second Cousin Geraldine when five\r\ndoctors had given her up? Valancy always felt very sceptical concerning\r\nthe virtues of the Purple Pills; but there _might_ be something in\r\nthem; and it was easier to take them than to face Dr. Trent alone. She\r\nwould glance over the magazines in the reading-room a few minutes and\r\nthen go home.\r\n\r\nValancy tried to read a story, but it made her furious. On every page\r\nwas a picture of the heroine surrounded by adoring men. And here was\r\nshe, Valancy Stirling, who could not get a solitary beau! Valancy\r\nslammed the magazine shut; she opened _Magic of Wings_. Her eyes fell\r\non the paragraph that changed her life.\r\n\r\n“_Fear is the original sin_,” wrote John Foster. “_Almost all the evil\r\nin the world has its origin in the fact that some one is afraid of\r\nsomething._ It is a cold, slimy serpent coiling about you. It is\r\nhorrible to live with fear; and it is of all things degrading.”\r\n\r\nValancy shut _Magic of Wings_ and stood up. She would go and see Dr.\r\nTrent."

      "content": "The ordeal was not so dreadful, after all. Dr. Trent was as gruff and\r\nabrupt as usual, but he did not tell her her ailment was imaginary. After\r\nhe had listened to her symptoms and asked a few questions and made a\r\nquick examination, he sat for a moment looking at her quite intently.\r\nValancy thought he looked as if he were sorry for her. She caught her\r\nbreath for a moment. Was the trouble serious? Oh, it couldn’t be,\r\nsurely—it really hadn’t bothered her _much_—only lately it had got a\r\nlittle worse.\r\n\r\nDr. Trent opened his mouth—but before he could speak the telephone at\r\nhis elbow rang sharply. He picked up the receiver. Valancy, watching\r\nhim, saw his face change suddenly as he listened,\r\n“’Lo—yes—yes—_what_?—yes—yes”—a brief interval—“My God!”\r\n\r\nDr. Trent dropped the receiver, dashed out of the room and upstairs\r\nwithout even a glance at Valancy. She heard him rushing madly about\r\noverhead, barking out a few remarks to somebody—presumably his\r\nhousekeeper. Then he came tearing downstairs with a club bag in his\r\nhand, snatched his hat and coat from the rack, jerked open the street\r\ndoor and rushed down the street in the direction of the station.\r\n\r\nValancy sat alone in the little office, feeling more absolutely foolish\r\nthan she had ever felt before in her life. Foolish—and humiliated. So\r\nthis was all that had come of her heroic determination to live up to\r\nJohn Foster and cast fear aside. Not only was she a failure as a\r\nrelative and non-existent as a sweetheart or friend, but she was not\r\neven of any importance as a patient. Dr. Trent had forgotten her very\r\npresence in his excitement over whatever message had come by the\r\ntelephone. She had gained nothing by ignoring Uncle James and flying in\r\nthe face of family tradition.\r\n\r\nFor a moment she was afraid she was going to cry. It _was_ all\r\nso—ridiculous. Then she heard Dr. Trent’s housekeeper coming down the\r\nstairs. Valancy rose and went to the office door.\r\n\r\n“The doctor forgot all about me,” she said with a twisted smile.\r\n\r\n“Well, that’s too bad,” said Mrs. Patterson sympathetically. “But it\r\nwasn’t much wonder, poor man. That was a telegram they ’phoned over\r\nfrom the Port. His son has been terribly injured in an auto accident in\r\nMontreal. The doctor had just ten minutes to catch the train. I don’t\r\nknow what he’ll do if anything happens to Ned—he’s just bound up in the\r\nboy. You’ll have to come again, Miss Stirling. I hope it’s nothing\r\nserious.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, nothing serious,” agreed Valancy. She felt a little less\r\nhumiliated. It was no wonder poor Dr. Trent had forgotten her at such a\r\nmoment. Nevertheless, she felt very flat and discouraged as she went\r\ndown the street.\r\n\r\nValancy went home by the short-cut of Lover’s Lane. She did not often\r\ngo through Lover’s Lane—but it was getting near supper-time and it\r\nwould never do to be late. Lover’s Lane wound back of the village,\r\nunder great elms and maples, and deserved its name. It was hard to go\r\nthere at any time and not find some canoodling couple—or young girls in\r\npairs, arms intertwined, earnestly talking over their little secrets.\r\nValancy didn’t know which made her feel more self-conscious and\r\nuncomfortable.\r\n\r\nThis evening she encountered both. She met Connie Hale and Kate Bayley,\r\nin new pink organdy dresses with flowers stuck coquettishly in their\r\nglossy, bare hair. Valancy had never had a pink dress or worn flowers\r\nin her hair. Then she passed a young couple she didn’t know, dandering\r\nalong, oblivious to everything but themselves. The young man’s arm was\r\naround the girl’s waist quite shamelessly. Valancy had never walked\r\nwith a man’s arm about her. She felt that she ought to be shocked—they\r\nmight leave that sort of thing for the screening twilight, at least—but\r\nshe wasn’t shocked. In another flash of desperate, stark honesty she\r\nowned to herself that she was merely envious. When she passed them she\r\nfelt quite sure they were laughing at her—pitying her—“there’s that\r\nqueer little old maid, Valancy Stirling. They say she never had a beau\r\nin her whole life”—Valancy fairly ran to get out of Lover’s Lane. Never\r\nhad she felt so utterly colourless and skinny and insignificant.\r\n\r\nJust where Lover’s Lane debouched on the street, an old car was parked.\r\nValancy knew that car well—by sound, at least—and everybody in Deerwood\r\nknew it. This was before the phrase “tin Lizzie” had come into\r\ncirculation—in Deerwood, at least; but if it had been known, this car\r\nwas the tinniest of Lizzies—though it was not a Ford but an old Grey\r\nSlosson. Nothing more battered and disreputable could be imagined.\r\n\r\nIt was Barney Snaith’s car and Barney himself was just scrambling up\r\nfrom under it, in overalls plastered with mud. Valancy gave him a\r\nswift, furtive look as she hurried by. This was only the second time\r\nshe had ever seen the notorious Barney Snaith, though she had heard\r\nenough about him in the five years that he had been living “up back” in\r\nMuskoka. The first time had been nearly a year ago, on the Muskoka\r\nroad. He had been crawling out from under his car then, too, and he had\r\ngiven her a cheerful grin as she went by—a little, whimsical grin that\r\ngave him the look of an amused gnome. He didn’t look bad—she didn’t\r\nbelieve he was bad, in spite of the wild yarns that were always being\r\ntold of him. Of course he went tearing in that terrible old Grey\r\nSlosson through Deerwood at hours when all decent people were in\r\nbed—often with old “Roaring Abel,” who made the night hideous with his\r\nhowls—“both of them dead drunk, my dear.” And every one knew that he\r\nwas an escaped convict and a defaulting bank clerk and a murderer in\r\nhiding and an infidel and an illegitimate son of old Roaring Abel Gay\r\nand the father of Roaring Abel’s illegitimate grandchild and a\r\ncounterfeiter and a forger and a few other awful things. But still\r\nValancy didn’t believe he was bad. Nobody with a smile like that could\r\nbe bad, no matter what he had done.\r\n\r\nIt was that night the Prince of the Blue Castle changed from a being of\r\ngrim jaw and hair with a dash of premature grey to a rakish individual\r\nwith overlong, tawny hair, dashed with red, dark-brown eyes, and ears\r\nthat stuck out just enough to give him an alert look but not enough to\r\nbe called flying jibs. But he still retained something a little grim\r\nabout the jaw.\r\n\r\nBarney Snaith looked even more disreputable than usual just now. It was\r\nvery evident that he hadn’t shaved for days, and his hands and arms,\r\nbare to the shoulders, were black with grease. But he was whistling\r\ngleefully to himself and he seemed so happy that Valancy envied him.\r\nShe envied him his light-heartedness and his irresponsibility and his\r\nmysterious little cabin up on an island in Lake Mistawis—even his\r\nrackety old Grey Slosson. Neither he nor his car had to be respectable\r\nand live up to traditions. When he rattled past her a few minutes\r\nlater, bareheaded, leaning back in his Lizzie at a raffish angle, his\r\nlongish hair blowing in the wind, a villainous-looking old black pipe\r\nin his mouth, she envied him again. Men had the best of it, no doubt\r\nabout that. This outlaw was happy, whatever he was or wasn’t. She,\r\nValancy Stirling, respectable, well-behaved to the last degree, was\r\nunhappy and had always been unhappy. So there you were.\r\n\r\nValancy was just in time for supper. The sun had clouded over, and a\r\ndismal, drizzling rain was falling again. Cousin Stickles had the\r\nneuralgia. Valancy had to do the family darning and there was no time\r\nfor _Magic of Wings_.\r\n\r\n“Can’t the darning wait till tomorrow?” she pleaded.\r\n\r\n“Tomorrow will bring its own duties,” said Mrs. Frederick inexorably.\r\n\r\nValancy darned all the evening and listened to Mrs. Frederick and\r\nCousin Stickles talking the eternal, niggling gossip of the clan, as\r\nthey knitted drearily at interminable black stockings. They discussed\r\nSecond Cousin Lilian’s approaching wedding in all its bearings. On the\r\nwhole, they approved. Second Cousin Lilian was doing well for herself.\r\n\r\n“Though she hasn’t hurried,” said Cousin Stickles. “She must be\r\ntwenty-five.”\r\n\r\n“There have not—fortunately—been many old maids in our connection,”\r\nsaid Mrs. Frederick bitterly.\r\n\r\nValancy flinched. She had run the darning needle into her finger.\r\n\r\nThird Cousin Aaron Gray had been scratched by a cat and had\r\nblood-poisoning in his finger. “Cats are most dangerous animals,” said\r\nMrs. Frederick. “I would never have a cat about the house.”\r\n\r\nShe glared significantly at Valancy through her terrible glasses. Once,\r\nfive years ago, Valancy had asked if she might have a cat. She had\r\nnever referred to it since, but Mrs. Frederick still suspected her of\r\nharbouring the unlawful desire in her heart of hearts.\r\n\r\nOnce Valancy sneezed. Now, in the Stirling code, it was very bad form\r\nto sneeze in public.\r\n\r\n“You can always repress a sneeze by pressing your finger on your upper\r\nlip,” said Mrs. Frederick rebukingly.\r\n\r\nHalf-past nine o’clock and so, as Mr. Pepys would say, to bed. But\r\nFirst Cousin Stickles’ neuralgic back must be rubbed with Redfern’s\r\nLiniment. Valancy did that. Valancy always had to do it. She hated the\r\nsmell of Redfern’s Liniment—she hated the smug, beaming, portly,\r\nbe-whiskered, be-spectacled picture of Dr. Redfern on the bottle. Her\r\nfingers smelled of the horrible stuff after she got into bed, in spite\r\nof all the scrubbing she gave them.\r\n\r\nValancy’s day of destiny had come and gone. She ended it as she had\r\nbegun it, in tears."

      "title": "CHAPTER VII",
      "content": "There was a rosebush on the little Stirling lawn, growing beside the\r\ngate. It was called “Doss’s rosebush.” Cousin Georgiana had given it to\r\nValancy five years ago and Valancy had planted it joyfully. She loved\r\nroses. But—of course—the rosebush never bloomed. That was her luck.\r\nValancy did everything she could think of and took the advice of\r\neverybody in the clan, but still the rosebush would not bloom. It\r\nthrove and grew luxuriantly, with great leafy branches untouched of\r\nrust or spider; but not even a bud had ever appeared on it. Valancy,\r\nlooking at it two days after her birthday, was filled with a sudden,\r\noverwhelming hatred for it. The thing wouldn’t bloom: very well, then,\r\nshe would cut it down. She marched to the tool-room in the barn for her\r\ngarden knife and she went at the rosebush viciously. A few minutes\r\nlater horrified Mrs. Frederick came out to the verandah and beheld her\r\ndaughter slashing insanely among the rosebush boughs. Half of them were\r\nalready strewn on the walk. The bush looked sadly dismantled.\r\n\r\n“Doss, what on earth are you doing? Have you gone crazy?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Valancy. She meant to say it defiantly, but habit was too\r\nstrong for her. She said it deprecatingly. “I—I just made up my mind to\r\ncut this bush down. It is no good. It never blooms—never will bloom.”\r\n\r\n“That is no reason for destroying it,” said Mrs. Frederick sternly. “It\r\nwas a beautiful bush and quite ornamental. You have made a\r\nsorry-looking thing of it.”\r\n\r\n“Rose trees should _bloom_,” said Valancy a little obstinately.\r\n\r\n“Don’t argue with _me_, Doss. Clear up that mess and leave the bush\r\nalone. I don’t know what Georgiana will say when she sees how you have\r\nhacked it to pieces. Really, I’m surprised at you. And to do it without\r\nconsulting _me_!”\r\n\r\n“The bush is mine,” muttered Valancy.\r\n\r\n“What’s that? What did you say, Doss?”\r\n\r\n“I only said the bush was mine,” repeated Valancy humbly.\r\n\r\nMrs. Frederick turned without a word and marched back into the house.\r\nThe mischief was done now. Valancy knew she had offended her mother\r\ndeeply and would not be spoken to or noticed in any way for two or\r\nthree days. Cousin Stickles would see to Valancy’s bringing-up but Mrs.\r\nFrederick would preserve the stony silence of outraged majesty.\r\n\r\nValancy sighed and put away her garden knife, hanging it precisely on\r\nits precise nail in the tool-shop. She cleared away the severed\r\nbranches and swept up the leaves. Her lips twitched as she looked at\r\nthe straggling bush. It had an odd resemblance to its shaken, scrawny\r\ndonor, little Cousin Georgiana herself.\r\n\r\n“I certainly have made an awful-looking thing of it,” thought Valancy.\r\n\r\nBut she did not feel repentant—only sorry she had offended her mother.\r\nThings would be so uncomfortable until she was forgiven. Mrs. Frederick\r\nwas one of those women who can make their anger felt all over a house.\r\nWalls and doors are no protection from it.\r\n\r\n“You’d better go uptown and git the mail,” said Cousin Stickles, when\r\nValancy went in. “_I_ can’t go—I feel all sorter peaky and piny this\r\nspring. I want you to stop at the drugstore and git me a bottle of\r\nRedfern’s Blood Bitters. There’s nothing like Redfern’s Bitters for\r\nbuilding a body up. Cousin James says the Purple Pills are the best,\r\nbut I know better. My poor dear husband took Redfern’s Bitters right up\r\nto the day he died. Don’t let them charge you more’n ninety cents. I\r\nkin git it for that at the Port. And what _have_ you been saying to\r\nyour poor mother? Do you ever stop to think, Doss, that you kin only\r\nhave one mother?”\r\n\r\n“One is enough for me,” thought Valancy undutifully, as she went\r\nuptown.\r\n\r\nShe got Cousin Stickles’ bottle of bitters and then she went to the\r\npost-office and asked for her mail at the General Delivery. Her mother\r\ndid not have a box. They got too little mail to bother with it. Valancy\r\ndid not expect any mail, except the _Christian Times_, which was the\r\nonly paper they took. They hardly ever got any letters. But Valancy\r\nrather liked to stand in the office and watch Mr. Carewe, the\r\ngrey-bearded, Santa-Clausy old clerk, handing out letters to the lucky\r\npeople who did get them. He did it with such a detached, impersonal,\r\nJove-like air, as if it did not matter in the least to him what\r\nsupernal joys or shattering horrors might be in those letters for the\r\npeople to whom they were addressed. Letters had a fascination for\r\nValancy, perhaps because she so seldom got any. In her Blue Castle\r\nexciting epistles, bound with silk and sealed with crimson, were always\r\nbeing brought to her by pages in livery of gold and blue, but in real\r\nlife her only letters were occasional perfunctory notes from relatives\r\nor an advertising circular.\r\n\r\nConsequently she was immensely surprised when Mr. Carewe, looking even\r\nmore Jovian than usual, poked a letter out to her. Yes, it was\r\naddressed to her plainly, in a fierce, black hand: “Miss Valancy\r\nStirling, Elm Street, Deerwood”—and the postmark was Montreal. Valancy\r\npicked it up with a little quickening of her breath. Montreal! It must\r\nbe from Doctor Trent. He had remembered her, after all.\r\n\r\nValancy met Uncle Benjamin coming in as she was going out and was glad\r\nthe letter was safely in her bag.\r\n\r\n“What,” said Uncle Benjamin, “is the difference between a donkey and a\r\npostage-stamp?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. What?” answered Valancy dutifully.\r\n\r\n“One you lick with a stick and the other you stick with a lick. Ha,\r\nha!”\r\n\r\nUncle Benjamin passed in, tremendously pleased with himself.\r\n\r\nCousin Stickles pounced on the _Times_ when Valancy got home, but it\r\ndid not occur to her to ask if there were any letters. Mrs. Frederick\r\nwould have asked it, but Mrs. Frederick’s lips at present were sealed.\r\nValancy was glad of this. If her mother had asked if there were any\r\nletters Valancy would have had to admit there was. Then she would have\r\nhad to let her mother and Cousin Stickles read the letter and all would\r\nbe discovered.\r\n\r\nHer heart acted strangely on the way upstairs, and she sat down by her\r\nwindow for a few minutes before opening her letter. She felt very\r\nguilty and deceitful. She had never before kept a letter secret from\r\nher mother. Every letter she had ever written or received had been read\r\nby Mrs. Frederick. That had never mattered. Valancy had never had\r\nanything to hide. But this _did_ matter. She could not have any one see\r\nthis letter. But her fingers trembled with a consciousness of\r\nwickedness and unfilial conduct as she opened it—trembled a little,\r\ntoo, perhaps, with apprehension. She felt quite sure there was nothing\r\nseriously wrong with her heart but—one never knew.\r\n\r\nDr. Trent’s letter was like himself—blunt, abrupt, concise, wasting no\r\nwords. Dr. Trent never beat about the bush. “Dear Miss Sterling”—and\r\nthen a page of black, positive writing. Valancy seemed to read it at a\r\nglance; she dropped it on her lap, her face ghost-white.\r\n\r\nDr. Trent told her that she had a very dangerous and fatal form of\r\nheart disease—angina pectoris—evidently complicated with an\r\naneurism—whatever that was—and in the last stages. He said, without\r\nmincing matters, that nothing could be done for her. If she took great\r\ncare of herself she might live a year—but she might also die at any\r\nmoment—Dr. Trent never troubled himself about euphemisms. She must be\r\ncareful to avoid all excitement and all severe muscular efforts. She\r\nmust eat and drink moderately, she must never run, she must go upstairs\r\nand uphill with great care. Any sudden jolt or shock might be fatal.\r\nShe was to get the prescription he enclosed filled and carry it with\r\nher always, taking a dose whenever her attacks came on. And he was hers\r\ntruly, H. B. Trent.\r\n\r\nValancy sat for a long while by her window. Outside was a world drowned\r\nin the light of a spring afternoon—skies entrancingly blue, winds\r\nperfumed and free, lovely, soft, blue hazes at the end of every street.\r\nOver at the railway station a group of young girls was waiting for a\r\ntrain; she heard their gay laughter as they chattered and joked. The\r\ntrain roared in and roared out again. But none of these things had any\r\nreality. Nothing had any reality except the fact that she had only\r\nanother year to live.\r\n\r\nWhen she was tired of sitting at the window she went over and lay down\r\non her bed, staring at the cracked, discoloured ceiling. The curious\r\nnumbness that follows on a staggering blow possessed her. She did not\r\nfeel anything except a boundless surprise and incredulity—behind which\r\nwas the conviction that Dr. Trent knew his business and that she,\r\nValancy Stirling, who had never lived, was about to die.\r\n\r\nWhen the gong rang for supper Valancy got up and went downstairs\r\nmechanically, from force of habit. She wondered that she had been let\r\nalone so long. But of course her mother would not pay any attention to\r\nher just now. Valancy was thankful for this. She thought the quarrel\r\nover the rosebush had been really, as Mrs. Frederick herself might have\r\nsaid, Providential. She could not eat anything, but both Mrs. Frederick\r\nand Cousin Stickles thought this was because she was deservedly unhappy\r\nover her mother’s attitude, and her lack of appetite was not commented\r\non. Valancy forced herself to swallow a cup of tea and then sat and\r\nwatched the others eat, with an odd feeling that years had passed since\r\nshe had sat with them at the dinner-table. She found herself smiling\r\ninwardly to think what a commotion she could make if she chose. Let her\r\nmerely tell them what was in Dr. Trent’s letter and there would be as\r\nmuch fuss made as if—Valancy thought bitterly—they really cared two\r\nstraws about her.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Trent’s housekeeper got word from him today,” said Cousin\r\nStickles, so suddenly that Valancy jumped guiltily. Was there anything\r\nin thought waves? “Mrs. Judd was talking to her uptown. They think his\r\nson will recover, but Dr. Trent wrote that if he did he was going to\r\ntake him abroad as soon as he was able to travel and wouldn’t be back\r\nhere for a year at least.”\r\n\r\n“That will not matter much to _us_,” said Mrs. Frederick majestically.\r\n“He is not _our_ doctor. I would not”—here she looked or seemed to look\r\naccusingly right through Valancy—“have _him_ to doctor a sick cat.”\r\n\r\n“May I go upstairs and lie down?” said Valancy faintly. “I—I have a\r\nheadache.”\r\n\r\n“What has given you a headache?” asked Cousin Stickles, since Mrs.\r\nFrederick would not. The question had to be asked. Valancy could not be\r\nallowed to have headaches without interference.\r\n\r\n“You ain’t in the habit of having headaches. I hope you’re not taking\r\nthe mumps. Here, try a spoonful of vinegar.”\r\n\r\n“Piffle!” said Valancy rudely, getting up from the table. She did not\r\ncare just then if she were rude. She had had to be so polite all her\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIf it had been possible for Cousin Stickles to turn pale she would\r\nhave. As it was not, she turned yellower.\r\n\r\n“Are you sure you ain’t feverish, Doss? You sound like it. You go and\r\nget right into bed,” said Cousin Stickles, thoroughly alarmed, “and\r\nI’ll come up and rub your forehead and the back of your neck with\r\nRedfern’s Liniment.”\r\n\r\nValancy had reached the door, but she turned. “I won’t be rubbed with\r\nRedfern’s Liniment!” she said.\r\n\r\nCousin Stickles stared and gasped. “What—what do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“I said I wouldn’t be rubbed with Redfern’s Liniment,” repeated\r\nValancy. “Horrid, sticky stuff! And it has the vilest smell of any\r\nliniment I ever saw. It’s no good. I want to be left alone, that’s\r\nall.”\r\n\r\nValancy went out, leaving Cousin Stickles aghast.\r\n\r\n“She’s feverish—she _must_ be feverish,” ejaculated Cousin Stickles.\r\n\r\nMrs. Frederick went on eating her supper. It did not matter whether\r\nValancy was or was not feverish. Valancy had been guilty of\r\nimpertinence to _her_."

      "title": "CHAPTER VIII",
      "content": "Valancy did not sleep that night. She lay awake all through the long\r\ndark hours—thinking—thinking. She made a discovery that surprised her:\r\nshe, who had been afraid of almost everything in life, was not afraid\r\nof death. It did not seem in the least terrible to her. And she need\r\nnot now be afraid of anything else. Why had she been afraid of things?\r\nBecause of life. Afraid of Uncle Benjamin because of the menace of\r\npoverty in old age. But now she would never be old—neglected—tolerated.\r\nAfraid of being an old maid all her life. But now she would not be an\r\nold maid very long. Afraid of offending her mother and her clan because\r\nshe had to live with and among them and couldn’t live peaceably if she\r\ndidn’t give in to them. But now she hadn’t. Valancy felt a curious\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nBut she was still horribly afraid of one thing—the fuss the whole\r\njamfry of them would make when she told them. Valancy shuddered at the\r\nthought of it. She couldn’t endure it. Oh, she knew so well how it\r\nwould be. First there would be indignation—yes, indignation on the part\r\nof Uncle James because she had gone to a doctor—any doctor—without\r\nconsulting HIM. Indignation on the part of her mother for being so sly\r\nand deceitful—“to your own mother, Doss.” Indignation on the part of\r\nthe whole clan because she had not gone to Dr. Marsh.\r\n\r\nThen would come the solicitude. She would be taken to Dr. Marsh, and\r\nwhen Dr. Marsh confirmed Dr. Trent’s diagnosis she would be taken to\r\nspecialists in Toronto and Montreal. Uncle Benjamin would foot the bill\r\nwith a splendid gesture of munificence in thus assisting the widow and\r\norphan, and talk forever after of the shocking fees specialists charged\r\nfor looking wise and saying they couldn’t do anything. And when the\r\nspecialists could do nothing for her Uncle James would insist on her\r\ntaking Purple Pills—“I’ve known them to effect a cure when _all_ the\r\ndoctors had given up”—and her mother would insist on Redfern’s Blood\r\nBitters, and Cousin Stickles would insist on rubbing her over the heart\r\nevery night with Redfern’s Liniment on the grounds that it _might_ do\r\ngood and _couldn’t_ do harm; and everybody else would have some pet\r\ndope for her to take. Dr. Stalling would come to her and say solemnly,\r\n“You are very ill. Are you prepared for what may be before you?”—almost\r\nas if he were going to shake his forefinger at her, the forefinger that\r\nhad not grown any shorter or less knobbly with age. And she would be\r\nwatched and checked like a baby and never let do anything or go\r\nanywhere alone. Perhaps she would not even be allowed to sleep alone\r\nlest she die in her sleep. Cousin Stickles or her mother would insist\r\non sharing her room and bed. Yes, undoubtedly they would.\r\n\r\nIt was this last thought that really decided Valancy. She could not put\r\nup with it and she wouldn’t. As the clock in the hall below struck\r\ntwelve Valancy suddenly and definitely made up her mind that she would\r\nnot tell anybody. She had always been told, ever since she could\r\nremember, that she must hide her feelings. “It is not ladylike to have\r\nfeelings,” Cousin Stickles had once told her disapprovingly. Well, she\r\nwould hide them with a vengeance.\r\n\r\nBut though she was not afraid of death she was not indifferent to it.\r\nShe found that she _resented_ it; it was not fair that she should have\r\nto die when she had never lived. Rebellion flamed up in her soul as the\r\ndark hours passed by—not because she had no future but because she had\r\nno past.\r\n\r\n“I’m poor—I’m ugly—I’m a failure—and I’m near death,” she thought. She\r\ncould see her own obituary notice in the Deerwood _Weekly Times_,\r\ncopied into the Port Lawrence _Journal_. “A deep gloom was cast over\r\nDeerwood, etc., etc.”—“leaves a large circle of friends to mourn, etc.,\r\netc., etc.”—lies, all lies. Gloom, forsooth! Nobody would miss her. Her\r\ndeath would not matter a straw to anybody. Not even her mother loved\r\nher—her mother who had been so disappointed that she was not a boy—or\r\nat least, a pretty girl.\r\n\r\nValancy reviewed her whole life between midnight and the early spring\r\ndawn. It was a very drab existence, but here and there an incident\r\nloomed out with a significance out of all proportion to its real\r\nimportance. These incidents were all unpleasant in one way or another.\r\nNothing really pleasant had ever happened to Valancy.\r\n\r\n“I’ve never had one wholly happy hour in my life—not one,” she thought.\r\n“I’ve just been a colourless nonentity. I remember reading somewhere\r\nonce that there is an hour in which a woman might be happy all her life\r\nif she could but find it. I’ve never found my hour—never, never. And I\r\nnever will now. If I could only have had that hour I’d be willing to\r\ndie.”\r\n\r\nThose significant incidents kept bobbing up in her mind like unbidden\r\nghosts, without any sequence of time or place. For instance, that time\r\nwhen, at sixteen, she had blued a tubful of clothes too deeply. And the\r\ntime when, at eight, she had “stolen” some raspberry jam from Aunt\r\nWellington’s pantry. Valancy never heard the last of those two\r\nmisdemeanours. At almost every clan gathering they were raked up\r\nagainst her as jokes. Uncle Benjamin hardly ever missed re-telling the\r\nraspberry jam incident—he had been the one to catch her, her face all\r\nstained and streaked.\r\n\r\n“I have really done so few bad things that they have to keep harping on\r\nthe old ones,” thought Valancy. “Why, I’ve never even had a quarrel\r\nwith any one. I haven’t an enemy. What a spineless thing I must be not\r\nto have even one enemy!”\r\n\r\nThere was that incident of the dust-pile at school when she was seven.\r\nValancy always recalled it when Dr. Stalling referred to the text, “To\r\nhim that hath shall be given and from him that hath not shall be taken\r\neven that which he hath.” Other people might puzzle over that text but\r\nit never puzzled Valancy. The whole relationship between herself and\r\nOlive, dating from the day of the dust-pile, was a commentary on it.\r\n\r\nShe had been going to school a year, but Olive, who was a year younger,\r\nhad just begun and had about her all the glamour of “a new girl” and an\r\nexceedingly pretty girl at that. It was at recess and all the girls,\r\nbig and little, were out on the road in front of the school making\r\ndust-piles. The aim of each girl was to have the biggest pile. Valancy\r\nwas good at making dust-piles—there was an art in it—and she had secret\r\nhopes of leading. But Olive, working off by herself, was suddenly\r\ndiscovered to have a larger dust-pile than anybody. Valancy felt no\r\njealousy. Her dust-pile was quite big enough to please her. Then one of\r\nthe older girls had an inspiration.\r\n\r\n“Let’s put all our dust on Olive’s pile and make a tremendous one,” she\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\nA frenzy seemed to seize the girls. They swooped down on the dust-piles\r\nwith pails and shovels and in a few seconds Olive’s pile was a\r\nveritable pyramid. In vain Valancy, with scrawny, outstretched little\r\narms, tried to protect hers. She was ruthlessly swept aside, her\r\ndust-pile scooped up and poured on Olive’s. Valancy turned away\r\nresolutely and began building another dust-pile. Again a bigger girl\r\npounced on it. Valancy stood before it, flushed, indignant, arms\r\noutspread.\r\n\r\n“Don’t take it,” she pleaded. “Please don’t take it.”\r\n\r\n“But _why_?” demanded the older girl. “Why won’t you help to build\r\nOlive’s bigger?”\r\n\r\n“I want my own little dust-pile,” said Valancy piteously.\r\n\r\nHer plea went unheeded. While she argued with one girl another scraped\r\nup her dust-pile. Valancy turned away, her heart swelling, her eyes\r\nfull of tears.\r\n\r\n“Jealous—you’re jealous!” said the girls mockingly.\r\n\r\n“You were very selfish,” said her mother coldly, when Valancy told her\r\nabout it at night. That was the first and last time Valancy had ever\r\ntaken any of her troubles to her mother.\r\n\r\nValancy was neither jealous nor selfish. It was only that she wanted a\r\ndust-pile of her own—small or big mattered not. A team of horses came\r\ndown the street—Olive’s dust pile was scattered over the roadway—the\r\nbell rang—the girls trooped into school and had forgotten the whole\r\naffair before they reached their seats. Valancy never forgot it. To\r\nthis day she resented it in her secret soul. But was it not symbolical\r\nof her life?\r\n\r\n“I’ve never been able to have my own dust-pile,” thought Valancy.\r\n\r\nThe enormous red moon she had seen rising right at the end of the\r\nstreet one autumn evening of her sixth year. She had been sick and cold\r\nwith the awful, uncanny horror of it. So near to her. So big. She had\r\nrun in trembling to her mother and her mother had laughed at her. She\r\nhad gone to bed and hidden her face under the clothes in terror lest\r\nshe might look at the window and see that horrible moon glaring in at\r\nher through it.\r\n\r\nThe boy who had tried to kiss her at a party when she was fifteen. She\r\nhad not let him—she had evaded him and run. He was the only boy who had\r\never tried to kiss her. Now, fourteen years later, Valancy found\r\nherself wishing that she had let him.\r\n\r\nThe time she had been made to apologise to Olive for something she\r\nhadn’t done. Olive had said that Valancy had pushed her into the mud\r\nand spoiled her new shoes _on purpose_. Valancy knew she hadn’t. It had\r\nbeen an accident—and even that wasn’t her fault—but nobody would\r\nbelieve her. She had to apologise—and kiss Olive to “make up.” The\r\ninjustice of it burned in her soul tonight.\r\n\r\nThat summer when Olive had the most beautiful hat, trimmed with creamy\r\nyellow net, with a wreath of red roses and little ribbon bows under the\r\nchin. Valancy had wanted a hat like that more than she had ever wanted\r\nanything. She pleaded for one and had been laughed at—all summer she\r\nhad to wear a horrid little brown sailor with elastic that cut behind\r\nher ears. None of the girls would go around with her because she was so\r\nshabby—nobody but Olive. People had thought Olive so sweet and\r\nunselfish.\r\n\r\n“I was an excellent foil for her,” thought Valancy. “Even then she knew\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\nValancy had tried to win a prize for attendance in Sunday School once.\r\nBut Olive won it. There were so many Sundays Valancy had to stay home\r\nbecause she had colds. She had once tried to “say a piece” in school\r\none Friday afternoon and had broken down in it. Olive was a good\r\nreciter and never got stuck.\r\n\r\nThe night she had spent in Port Lawrence with Aunt Isabel when she was\r\nten. Byron Stirling was there; from Montreal, twelve years old,\r\nconceited, clever. At family prayers in the morning Byron had reached\r\nacross and given Valancy’s thin arm such a savage pinch that she\r\nscreamed out with pain. After prayers were over she was summoned to\r\nAunt Isabel’s bar of judgment. But when she said Byron had pinched her\r\nByron denied it. He said she cried out because the kitten scratched\r\nher. He said she had put the kitten up on her chair and was playing\r\nwith it when she should have been listening to Uncle David’s prayer. He\r\nwas _believed_. In the Stirling clan the boys were always believed\r\nbefore the girls. Valancy was sent home in disgrace because of her\r\nexceedingly bad behavior during family prayers and she was not asked to\r\nAunt Isabel’s again for many moons.\r\n\r\nThe time Cousin Betty Stirling was married. Somehow Valancy got wind of\r\nthe fact that Betty was going to ask her to be one of her bridesmaids.\r\nValancy was secretly uplifted. It would be a delightful thing to be a\r\nbridesmaid. And of course she would have to have a new dress for it—a\r\npretty new dress—a pink dress. Betty wanted her bridesmaids to dress in\r\npink.\r\n\r\nBut Betty had never asked her, after all. Valancy couldn’t guess why,\r\nbut long after her secret tears of disappointment had been dried Olive\r\ntold her. Betty, after much consultation and reflection, had decided\r\nthat Valancy was too insignificant—she would “spoil the effect.” That\r\nwas nine years ago. But tonight Valancy caught her breath with the old\r\npain and sting of it.\r\n\r\nThat day in her eleventh year when her mother had badgered her into\r\nconfessing something she had never done. Valancy had denied it for a\r\nlong time but eventually for peace’ sake she had given in and pleaded\r\nguilty. Mrs. Frederick was always making people lie by pushing them\r\ninto situations where they _had_ to lie. Then her mother had made her\r\nkneel down on the parlour floor, between herself and Cousin Stickles,\r\nand say, “O God, please forgive me for not speaking the truth.” Valancy\r\nhad said it, but as she rose from her knees she muttered, “But, O God,\r\n_you_ know I did speak the truth.” Valancy had not then heard of\r\nGalileo but her fate was similar to his. She was punished just as\r\nseverely as if she hadn’t confessed and prayed.\r\n\r\nThe winter she went to dancing-school. Uncle James had decreed she\r\nshould go and had paid for her lessons. How she had looked forward to\r\nit! And how she had hated it! She had never had a voluntary partner.\r\nThe teacher always had to tell some boy to dance with her, and\r\ngenerally he had been sulky about it. Yet Valancy was a good dancer, as\r\nlight on her feet as thistledown. Olive, who never lacked eager\r\npartners, was heavy.\r\n\r\nThe affair of the button-string, when she was ten. All the girls in\r\nschool had button-strings. Olive had a very long one with a great many\r\nbeautiful buttons. Valancy had one. Most of the buttons on it were very\r\ncommonplace, but she had six beauties that had come off Grandmother\r\nStirling’s wedding-gown—sparkling buttons of gold and glass, much more\r\nbeautiful than any Olive had. Their possession conferred a certain\r\ndistinction on Valancy. She knew every little girl in school envied her\r\nthe exclusive possession of those beautiful buttons. When Olive saw\r\nthem on the button-string she had looked at them narrowly but said\r\nnothing—then. The next day Aunt Wellington had come to Elm Street and\r\ntold Mrs. Frederick that she thought Olive should have some of those\r\nbuttons—Grandmother Stirling was just as much Wellington’s mother as\r\nFrederick’s. Mrs. Frederick had agreed amiably. She could not afford to\r\nfall out with Aunt Wellington. Moreover, the matter was of no\r\nimportance whatever. Aunt Wellington carried off four of the buttons,\r\ngenerously leaving two for Valancy. Valancy had torn these from her\r\nstring and flung them on the floor—she had not yet learned that it was\r\nunladylike to have feelings—and had been sent supperless to bed for the\r\nexhibition.\r\n\r\nThe night of Margaret Blunt’s party. She had made such pathetic efforts\r\nto be pretty that night. Rob Walker was to be there; and two nights\r\nbefore, on the moonlit verandah of Uncle Herbert’s cottage at Mistawis,\r\nRob had really seemed attracted to her. At Margaret’s party Rob never\r\neven asked her to dance—did not notice her at all. She was a\r\nwallflower, as usual. That, of course, was years ago. People in\r\nDeerwood had long since given up inviting Valancy to dances. But to\r\nValancy its humiliation and disappointment were of the other day. Her\r\nface burned in the darkness as she recalled herself, sitting there with\r\nher pitifully crimped, thin hair and the cheeks she had pinched for an\r\nhour before coming, in an effort to make them red. All that came of it\r\nwas a wild story that Valancy Stirling was rouged at Margaret Blunt’s\r\nparty. In those days in Deerwood that was enough to wreck your\r\ncharacter forever. It did not wreck Valancy’s, or even damage it.\r\nPeople knew _she_ couldn’t be fast if she tried. They only laughed at\r\nher.\r\n\r\n“I’ve had nothing but a second-hand existence,” decided Valancy. “All\r\nthe great emotions of life have passed me by. I’ve never even had a\r\ngrief. And have I ever really loved anybody? Do I really love Mother?\r\nNo, I don’t. That’s the truth, whether it is disgraceful or not. I\r\ndon’t love her—I’ve never loved her. What’s worse, I don’t even like\r\nher. So I don’t know anything about any kind of love. My life has been\r\nempty—empty. Nothing is worse than emptiness. Nothing!” Valancy\r\nejaculated the last “nothing” aloud passionately. Then she moaned and\r\nstopped thinking about anything for a while. One of her attacks of pain\r\nhad come on.\r\n\r\nWhen it was over something had happened to Valancy—perhaps the\r\nculmination of the process that had been going on in her mind ever\r\nsince she had read Dr. Trent’s letter. It was three o’clock in the\r\nmorning—the wisest and most accursed hour of the clock. But sometimes\r\nit sets us free.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been trying to please other people all my life and failed,” she\r\nsaid. “After this I shall please myself. I shall never pretend anything\r\nagain. I’ve breathed an atmosphere of fibs and pretences and evasions\r\nall my life. What a luxury it will be to tell the truth! I may not be\r\nable to do much that I want to do but I won’t do another thing that I\r\ndon’t want to do. Mother can pout for weeks—I shan’t worry over it.\r\n‘Despair is a free man—hope is a slave.’”\r\n\r\nValancy got up and dressed, with a deepening of that curious sense of\r\nfreedom. When she had finished with her hair she opened the window and\r\nhurled the jar of potpourri over into the next lot. It smashed\r\ngloriously against the schoolgirl complexion on the old carriage-shop.\r\n\r\n“I’m sick of the fragrance of dead things,” said Valancy."

      "content": "Uncle Herbert and Aunt Alberta’s silver wedding was delicately referred\r\nto among the Stirlings during the following weeks as “the time we first\r\nnoticed poor Valancy was—a little—_you_ understand?”\r\n\r\nNot for worlds would any of the Stirlings have said out and out at\r\nfirst that Valancy had gone mildly insane or even that her mind was\r\nslightly deranged. Uncle Benjamin was considered to have gone entirely\r\ntoo far when he had ejaculated, “She’s dippy—I tell you, she’s dippy,”\r\nand was only excused because of the outrageousness of Valancy’s conduct\r\nat the aforesaid wedding dinner.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles had noticed a few things that\r\nmade them uneasy _before_ the dinner. It had begun with the rosebush,\r\nof course; and Valancy never was really “quite right” again. She did\r\nnot seem to worry in the least over the fact that her mother was not\r\nspeaking to her. You would never suppose she noticed it at all. She had\r\nflatly refused to take either Purple Pills or Redfern’s Bitters. She\r\nhad announced coolly that she did not intend to answer to the name of\r\n“Doss” any longer. She had told Cousin Stickles that she wished she\r\nwould give up wearing that brooch with Cousin Artemas Stickles’ hair in\r\nit. She had moved her bed in her room to the opposite corner. She had\r\nread _Magic of Wings_ Sunday afternoon. When Cousin Stickles had\r\nrebuked her Valancy had said indifferently, “Oh, I forgot it was\r\nSunday”—and _had gone on reading it_.\r\n\r\nCousin Stickles had seen a terrible thing—she had caught Valancy\r\nsliding down the bannister. Cousin Stickles did not tell Mrs. Frederick\r\nthis—poor Amelia was worried enough as it was. But it was Valancy’s\r\nannouncement on Saturday night that she was not going to go to the\r\nAnglican church any more that broke through Mrs. Frederick’s stony\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n“Not going to church any more! Doss, have you absolutely taken leave——”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I’m going to church,” said Valancy airily. “I’m going to the\r\nPresbyterian church. But to the Anglican church I will not go.”\r\n\r\nThis was even worse. Mrs. Frederick had recourse to tears, having found\r\noutraged majesty had ceased to be effective.\r\n\r\n“What have you got against the Anglican church?” she sobbed.\r\n\r\n“Nothing—only just that you’ve always made me go there. If you’d made\r\nme go to the Presbyterian church I’d want to go to the Anglican.”\r\n\r\n“Is that a nice thing to say to your mother? Oh, how true it is that it\r\nis sharper than a serpent’s tooth to have a thankless child.”\r\n\r\n“Is that a nice thing to say to your daughter?” said unrepentant\r\nValancy.\r\n\r\nSo Valancy’s behaviour at the silver wedding was not quite the surprise\r\nto Mrs. Frederick and Christine Stickles that it was to the rest. They\r\nwere doubtful about the wisdom of taking her, but concluded it would\r\n“make talk” if they didn’t. Perhaps she would behave herself, and so\r\nfar no outsider suspected there was anything queer about her. By a\r\nspecial mercy of Providence it had poured torrents Sunday morning, so\r\nValancy had not carried out her hideous threat of going to the\r\nPresbyterian church.\r\n\r\nValancy would not have cared in the least if they had left her at home.\r\nThese family celebrations were all hopelessly dull. But the Stirlings\r\nalways celebrated everything. It was a long-established custom. Even\r\nMrs. Frederick gave a dinner party on her wedding anniversary and\r\nCousin Stickles had friends in to supper on her birthday. Valancy hated\r\nthese entertainments because they had to pinch and save and contrive\r\nfor weeks afterwards to pay for them. But she wanted to go to the\r\nsilver wedding. It would hurt Uncle Herbert’s feelings if she stayed\r\naway, and she rather liked Uncle Herbert. Besides, she wanted to look\r\nover all her relatives from her new angle. It would be an excellent\r\nplace to make public her declaration of independence if occasion\r\noffered.\r\n\r\n“Put on your brown silk dress,” said Mrs. Stirling.\r\n\r\nAs if there were anything else to put on! Valancy had only the one\r\nfestive dress—that snuffy-brown silk Aunt Isabel had given her. Aunt\r\nIsabel had decreed that Valancy should never wear colours. They did not\r\nbecome her. When she was young they allowed her to wear white, but that\r\nhad been tacitly dropped for some years. Valancy put on the brown silk.\r\nIt had a high collar and long sleeves. She had never had a dress with\r\nlow neck and elbow sleeves, although they had been worn, even in\r\nDeerwood, for over a year. But she did not do her hair pompadour. She\r\nknotted it on her neck and pulled it out over her ears. She thought it\r\nbecame her—only the little knot was so absurdly small. Mrs. Frederick\r\nresented the hair but decided it was wisest to say nothing on the eve\r\nof the party. It was so important that Valancy should be kept in good\r\nhumour, if possible, until it was over. Mrs. Frederick did not reflect\r\nthat this was the first time in her life that she had thought it\r\nnecessary to consider Valancy’s humours. But then Valancy had never\r\nbeen “queer” before.\r\n\r\nOn their way to Uncle Herbert’s—Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles\r\nwalking in front, Valancy trotting meekly along behind—Roaring Abel\r\ndrove past them. Drunk as usual but not in the roaring stage. Just\r\ndrunk enough to be excessively polite. He raised his disreputable old\r\ntartan cap with the air of a monarch saluting his subjects and swept\r\nthem a grand bow. Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles dared not cut\r\nRoaring Abel altogether. He was the only person in Deerwood who could\r\nbe got to do odd jobs of carpentering and repairing when they needed to\r\nbe done, so it would not do to offend him. But they responded with only\r\nthe stiffest, slightest of bows. Roaring Abel must be kept in his\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nValancy, behind them, did a thing they were fortunately spared seeing.\r\nShe smiled gaily and waved her hand to Roaring Abel. Why not? She had\r\nalways liked the old sinner. He was such a jolly, picturesque,\r\nunashamed reprobate and stood out against the drab respectability of\r\nDeerwood and its customs like a flame-red flag of revolt and protest.\r\nOnly a few nights ago Abel had gone through Deerwood in the wee sma’s,\r\nshouting oaths at the top of his stentorian voice which could be heard\r\nfor miles, and lashing his horse into a furious gallop as he tore along\r\nprim, proper Elm Street.\r\n\r\n“Yelling and blaspheming like a fiend,” shuddered Cousin Stickles at\r\nthe breakfast-table.\r\n\r\n“I cannot understand why the judgment of the Lord has not fallen upon\r\nthat man long ere this,” said Mrs. Frederick petulantly, as if she\r\nthought Providence was very dilatory and ought to have a gentle\r\nreminder.\r\n\r\n“He’ll be picked up dead some morning—he’ll fall under his horse’s\r\nhoofs and be trampled to death,” said Cousin Stickles reassuringly.\r\n\r\nValancy had said nothing, of course; but she wondered to herself if\r\nRoaring Abel’s periodical sprees were not his futile protest against\r\nthe poverty and drudgery and monotony of his existence. _She_ went on\r\ndream sprees in her Blue Castle. Roaring Abel, having no imagination,\r\ncould not do that. _His_ escapes from reality had to be concrete. So\r\nshe waved at him today with a sudden fellow feeling, and Roaring Abel,\r\nnot too drunk to be astonished, nearly fell off his seat in his\r\namazement.\r\n\r\nBy this time they had reached Maple Avenue and Uncle Herbert’s house, a\r\nlarge, pretentious structure peppered with meaningless bay windows and\r\nexcrescent porches. A house that always looked like a stupid,\r\nprosperous, self-satisfied man with warts on his face.\r\n\r\n“A house like that,” said Valancy solemnly, “is a blasphemy.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Frederick was shaken to her soul. What had Valancy said? Was it\r\nprofane? Or only just queer? Mrs. Frederick took off her hat in Aunt\r\nAlberta’s spare-room with trembling hands. She made one more feeble\r\nattempt to avert disaster. She held Valancy back on the landing as\r\nCousin Stickles went downstairs.\r\n\r\n“Won’t you try to remember you’re a lady?” she pleaded.\r\n\r\n“Oh, if there were only any hope of being able to forget it!” said\r\nValancy wearily.\r\n\r\nMrs. Frederick felt that she had not deserved this from Providence."

      "content": "“Bless this food to our use and consecrate our lives to Thy service,”\r\nsaid Uncle Herbert briskly.\r\n\r\nAunt Wellington frowned. She always considered Herbert’s graces\r\nentirely too short and “flippant.” A grace, to be a grace in Aunt\r\nWellington’s eyes, had to be at least three minutes long and uttered in\r\nan unearthly tone, between a groan and a chant. As a protest she kept\r\nher head bent a perceptible time after all the rest had been lifted.\r\nWhen she permitted herself to sit upright she found Valancy looking at\r\nher. Ever afterwards Aunt Wellington averred that she had known from\r\nthat moment that there was something wrong with Valancy. In those\r\nqueer, slanted eyes of hers—“we should always have known she was not\r\nentirely _right_ with eyes like that”—there was an odd gleam of mockery\r\nand amusement—as if Valancy were laughing at _her_. Such a thing was\r\nunthinkable, of course. Aunt Wellington at once ceased to think it.\r\n\r\nValancy was enjoying herself. She had never enjoyed herself at a\r\n“family reunion” before. In social functions, as in childish games, she\r\nhad only “filled in.” Her clan had always considered her very dull. She\r\nhad no parlour tricks. And she had been in the habit of taking refuge\r\nfrom the boredom of family parties in her Blue Castle, which resulted\r\nin an absent-mindedness that increased her reputation for dulness and\r\nvacuity.\r\n\r\n“She has no social presence whatever,” Aunt Wellington had decreed once\r\nand for all. Nobody dreamed that Valancy was dumb in their presence\r\nmerely because she was afraid of them. Now she was no longer afraid of\r\nthem. The shackles had been stricken off her soul. She was quite\r\nprepared to talk if occasion offered. Meanwhile she was giving herself\r\nsuch freedom of thought as she had never dared to take before. She let\r\nherself go with a wild, inner exultation, as Uncle Herbert carved the\r\nturkey. Uncle Herbert gave Valancy a second look that day. Being a man,\r\nhe didn’t know what she had done to her hair, but he thought\r\nsurprisedly that Doss was not such a bad-looking girl, after all; and\r\nhe put an extra piece of white meat on her plate.\r\n\r\n“What herb is most injurious to a young lady’s beauty?” propounded\r\nUncle Benjamin by way of starting conversation—“loosening things up a\r\nbit,” as he would have said.\r\n\r\nValancy, whose duty it was to say, “What?” did not say it. Nobody else\r\nsaid it, so Uncle Benjamin, after an expectant pause, had to answer,\r\n“Thyme,” and felt that his riddle had fallen flat. He looked\r\nresentfully at Valancy, who had never failed him before, but Valancy\r\ndid not seem even to be aware of him. She was gazing around the table,\r\nexamining relentlessly every one in this depressing assembly of\r\nsensible people and watching their little squirms with a detached,\r\namused smile.\r\n\r\nSo these were the people she had always held in reverence and fear. She\r\nseemed to see them with new eyes.\r\n\r\nBig, capable, patronising, voluble Aunt Mildred, who thought herself\r\nthe cleverest woman in the clan, her husband a little lower than the\r\nangels and her children wonders. Had not her son, Howard, been all\r\nthrough teething at eleven months? And could she not tell you the best\r\nway to do everything, from cooking mushrooms to picking up a snake?\r\nWhat a bore she was! What ugly moles she had on her face!\r\n\r\nCousin Gladys, who was always praising her son, who had died young, and\r\nalways fighting with her living one. She had neuritis—or what she\r\ncalled neuritis. It jumped about from one part of her body to another.\r\nIt was a convenient thing. If anybody wanted her to go somewhere she\r\ndidn’t want to go she had neuritis in her legs. And always if any\r\nmental effort was required she could have neuritis in her head. You\r\ncan’t _think_ with neuritis in your head, my dear.\r\n\r\n“What an old humbug you are!” thought Valancy impiously.\r\n\r\nAunt Isabel. Valancy counted her chins. Aunt Isabel was the critic of\r\nthe clan. She had always gone about squashing people flat. More members\r\nof it than Valancy were afraid of her. She had, it was conceded, a\r\nbiting tongue.\r\n\r\n“I wonder what would happen to your face if you ever smiled,”\r\nspeculated Valancy, unblushingly.\r\n\r\nSecond Cousin Sarah Taylor, with her great, pale, expressionless eyes,\r\nwho was noted for the variety of her pickle recipes and for nothing\r\nelse. So afraid of saying something indiscreet that she never said\r\nanything worth listening to. So proper that she blushed when she saw\r\nthe advertisement picture of a corset and had put a dress on her Venus\r\nde Milo statuette which made it look “real tasty.”\r\n\r\nLittle Cousin Georgiana. Not such a bad little soul. But dreary—very.\r\nAlways looking as if she had just been starched and ironed. Always\r\nafraid to let herself go. The only thing she really enjoyed was a\r\nfuneral. You knew where you were with a corpse. Nothing more could\r\nhappen to _it_. But while there was life there was fear.\r\n\r\nUncle James. Handsome, black, with his sarcastic, trap-like mouth and\r\niron-grey side-burns, whose favourite amusement was to write\r\ncontroversial letters to the _Christian Times_, attacking Modernism.\r\nValancy always wondered if he looked as solemn when he was asleep as he\r\ndid when awake. No wonder his wife had died young. Valancy remembered\r\nher. A pretty, sensitive thing. Uncle James had denied her everything\r\nshe wanted and showered on her everything she didn’t want. He had\r\nkilled her—quite legally. She had been smothered and starved.\r\n\r\nUncle Benjamin, wheezy, pussy-mouthed. With great pouches under eyes\r\nthat held nothing in reverence.\r\n\r\nUncle Wellington. Long, pallid face, thin, pale-yellow hair—“one of the\r\nfair Stirlings”—thin, stooping body, abominably high forehead with such\r\nugly wrinkles, and “eyes about as intelligent as a fish’s,” thought\r\nValancy. “Looks like a cartoon of himself.”\r\n\r\nAunt Wellington. Named Mary but called by her husband’s name to\r\ndistinguish her from Great-aunt Mary. A massive, dignified, permanent\r\nlady. Splendidly arranged, iron-grey hair. Rich, fashionable beaded\r\ndress. Had _her_ moles removed by electrolysis—which Aunt Mildred\r\nthought was a wicked evasion of the purposes of God.\r\n\r\nUncle Herbert, with his spiky grey hair. Aunt Alberta, who twisted her\r\nmouth so unpleasantly in talking and had a great reputation for\r\nunselfishness because she was always giving up a lot of things she\r\ndidn’t want. Valancy let them off easily in her judgment because she\r\nliked them, even if they were in Milton’s expressive phrase, “stupidly\r\ngood.” But she wondered for what inscrutable reason Aunt Alberta had\r\nseen fit to tie a black velvet ribbon around each of her chubby arms\r\nabove the elbow.\r\n\r\nThen she looked across the table at Olive. Olive, who had been held up\r\nto her as a paragon of beauty, behaviour and success as long as she\r\ncould remember. “Why can’t you hold yourself like Olive, Doss? Why\r\ncan’t you stand correctly like Olive, Doss? Why can’t you speak\r\nprettily like Olive, Doss? Why can’t you make an effort, Doss?”\r\n\r\nValancy’s elfin eyes lost their mocking glitter and became pensive and\r\nsorrowful. You could not ignore or disdain Olive. It was quite\r\nimpossible to deny that she was beautiful and effective and sometimes\r\nshe was a little intelligent. Her mouth might be a trifle heavy—she\r\nmight show her fine, white, regular teeth rather too lavishly when she\r\nsmiled. But when all was said and done, Olive justified Uncle\r\nBenjamin’s summing up—“a stunning girl.” Yes, Valancy agreed in her\r\nheart, Olive was stunning.\r\n\r\nRich, golden-brown hair, elaborately dressed, with a sparkling bandeau\r\nholding its glossy puffs in place; large, brilliant blue eyes and thick\r\nsilken lashes; face of rose and bare neck of snow, rising above her\r\ngown; great pearl bubbles in her ears; the blue-white diamond flame on\r\nher long, smooth, waxen finger with its rosy, pointed nail. Arms of\r\nmarble, gleaming through green chiffon and shadow lace. Valancy felt\r\nsuddenly thankful that her own scrawny arms were decently swathed in\r\nbrown silk. Then she resumed her tabulation of Olive’s charms.\r\n\r\nTall. Queenly. Confident. Everything that Valancy was _not_. Dimples,\r\ntoo, in cheeks and chin. “A woman with dimples always gets her own\r\nway,” thought Valancy, in a recurring spasm of bitterness at the fate\r\nwhich had denied her even one dimple.\r\n\r\nOlive was only a year younger than Valancy, though a stranger would\r\nhave thought that there was at least ten years between them. But nobody\r\never dreaded old maidenhood for her. Olive had been surrounded by a\r\ncrowd of eager beaus since her early teens, just as her mirror was\r\nalways surrounded by a fringe of cards, photographs, programmes and\r\ninvitations. At eighteen, when she had graduated from Havergal College,\r\nOlive had been engaged to Will Desmond, lawyer in embryo. Will Desmond\r\nhad died and Olive had mourned for him properly for two years. When she\r\nwas twenty-three she had a hectic affair with Donald Jackson. But Aunt\r\nand Uncle Wellington disapproved of that and in the end Olive dutifully\r\ngave him up. Nobody in the Stirling clan—whatever outsiders might\r\nsay—hinted that she did so because Donald himself was cooling off.\r\nHowever that might be, Olive’s third venture met with everybody’s\r\napproval. Cecil Price was clever and handsome and “one of the Port\r\nLawrence Prices.” Olive had been engaged to him for three years. He had\r\njust graduated in civil engineering and they were to be married as soon\r\nas he landed a contract. Olive’s hope chest was full to overflowing\r\nwith exquisite things and Olive had already confided to Valancy what\r\nher wedding-dress was to be. Ivory silk draped with lace, white satin\r\ncourt train, lined with pale green georgette, heirloom veil of Brussels\r\nlace. Valancy knew also—though Olive had not told her—that the\r\nbridesmaids were selected and that she was not among them.\r\n\r\nValancy had, after a fashion, always been Olive’s confidante—perhaps\r\nbecause she was the only girl in the connection who could not bore\r\nOlive with return confidences. Olive always told Valancy all the\r\ndetails of her love affairs, from the days when the little boys in\r\nschool used to “persecute” her with love letters. Valancy could not\r\ncomfort herself by thinking these affairs mythical. Olive really had\r\nthem. Many men had gone mad over her besides the three fortunate ones.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what the poor idiots see in me, that drives them to make\r\nsuch double idiots of themselves,” Olive was wont to say. Valancy would\r\nhave liked to say, “I don’t either,” but truth and diplomacy both\r\nrestrained her. She _did_ know, perfectly well. Olive Stirling was one\r\nof the girls about whom men do go mad just as indubitably as she,\r\nValancy, was one of the girls at whom no man ever looked twice.\r\n\r\n“And yet,” thought Valancy, summing her up with a new and merciless\r\nconclusiveness, “she’s like a dewless morning. There’s _something_\r\nlacking.”"

      "content": "Meanwhile the dinner in its earlier stages was dragging its slow length\r\nalong true to Stirling form. The room was chilly, in spite of the\r\ncalendar, and Aunt Alberta had the gas-logs lighted. Everybody in the\r\nclan envied her those gas-logs except Valancy. Glorious open fires\r\nblazed in every room of her Blue Castle when autumnal nights were cool,\r\nbut she would have frozen to death in it before she would have\r\ncommitted the sacrilege of a gas-log. Uncle Herbert made his hardy\r\nperennial joke when he helped Aunt Wellington to the cold meat—“Mary,\r\nwill you have a little lamb?” Aunt Mildred told the same old story of\r\nonce finding a lost ring in a turkey’s crop. Uncle Benjamin told _his_\r\nfavourite prosy tale of how he had once chased and punished a now\r\nfamous man for stealing apples. Second Cousin Jane described all her\r\nsufferings with an ulcerating tooth. Aunt Wellington admired the\r\npattern of Aunt Alberta’s silver teaspoons and lamented the fact that\r\none of her own had been lost.\r\n\r\n“It spoiled the set. I could never get it matched. And it was my\r\nwedding-present from dear old Aunt Matilda.”\r\n\r\nAunt Isabel thought the seasons were changing and couldn’t imagine what\r\nhad become of our good, old-fashioned springs. Cousin Georgiana, as\r\nusual, discussed the last funeral and wondered, audibly, “which of us\r\nwill be the next to pass away.” Cousin Georgiana could never say\r\nanything as blunt as “die.” Valancy thought she could tell her, but\r\ndidn’t. Cousin Gladys, likewise as usual, had a grievance. Her visiting\r\nnephews had nipped all the buds off her house-plants and chivied her\r\nbrood of fancy chickens—“squeezed some of them actually to death, my\r\ndear.”\r\n\r\n“Boys will be boys,” reminded Uncle Herbert tolerantly.\r\n\r\n“But they needn’t be ramping, rampageous animals,” retorted Cousin\r\nGladys, looking round the table for appreciation of her wit. Everybody\r\nsmiled except Valancy. Cousin Gladys remembered that. A few minutes\r\nlater, when Ellen Hamilton was being discussed, Cousin Gladys spoke of\r\nher as “one of those shy, plain girls who can’t get husbands,” and\r\nglanced significantly at Valancy.\r\n\r\nUncle James thought the conversation was sagging to a rather low plane\r\nof personal gossip. He tried to elevate it by starting an abstract\r\ndiscussion on “the greatest happiness.” Everybody was asked to state\r\nhis or her idea of “the greatest happiness.”\r\n\r\nAunt Mildred thought the greatest happiness—for a woman—was to be “a\r\nloving and beloved wife and mother.” Aunt Wellington thought it would\r\nbe to travel in Europe. Olive thought it would be to be a great singer\r\nlike Tetrazzini. Cousin Gladys remarked mournfully that _her_ greatest\r\nhappiness would be to be free—absolutely free—from neuritis. Cousin\r\nGeorgiana’s greatest happiness would be “to have her dear, dead brother\r\nRichard back.” Aunt Alberta remarked vaguely that the greatest\r\nhappiness was to be found in “the poetry of life” and hastily gave some\r\ndirections to her maid to prevent any one asking her what she meant.\r\nMrs. Frederick said the greatest happiness was to spend your life in\r\nloving service for others, and Cousin Stickles and Aunt Isabel agreed\r\nwith her—Aunt Isabel with a resentful air, as if she thought Mrs.\r\nFrederick had taken the wind out of her sails by saying it first. “We\r\nare all too prone,” continued Mrs. Frederick, determined not to lose so\r\ngood an opportunity, “to live in selfishness, worldliness and sin.” The\r\nother women all felt rebuked for their low ideals, and Uncle James had\r\na conviction that the conversation had been uplifted with a vengeance.\r\n\r\n“The greatest happiness,” said Valancy suddenly and distinctly, “is to\r\nsneeze when you want to.”\r\n\r\nEverybody stared. Nobody felt it safe to say anything. Was Valancy\r\ntrying to be funny? It was incredible. Mrs. Frederick, who had been\r\nbreathing easier since the dinner had progressed so far without any\r\noutbreak on the part of Valancy, began to tremble again. But she deemed\r\nit the part of prudence to say nothing. Uncle Benjamin was not so\r\nprudent. He rashly rushed in where Mrs. Frederick feared to tread.\r\n\r\n“Doss,” he chuckled, “what is the difference between a young girl and\r\nan old maid?”\r\n\r\n“One is happy and careless and the other is cappy and hairless,” said\r\nValancy. “You have asked that riddle at least fifty times in my\r\nrecollection, Uncle Ben. Why don’t you hunt up some new riddles if\r\nriddle you _must_? It is such a fatal mistake to try to be funny if you\r\ndon’t succeed.”\r\n\r\nUncle Benjamin stared foolishly. Never in his life had he, Benjamin\r\nStirling, of Stirling and Frost, been spoken to so. And by Valancy of\r\nall people! He looked feebly around the table to see what the others\r\nthought of it. Everybody was looking rather blank. Poor Mrs. Frederick\r\nhad shut her eyes. And her lips moved tremblingly—as if she were\r\npraying. Perhaps she was. The situation was so unprecedented that\r\nnobody knew how to meet it. Valancy went on calmly eating her salad as\r\nif nothing out of the usual had occurred.\r\n\r\nAunt Alberta, to save her dinner, plunged into an account of how a dog\r\nhad bitten her recently. Uncle James, to back her up, asked where the\r\ndog had bitten her.\r\n\r\n“Just a little below the Catholic church,” said Aunt Alberta.\r\n\r\nAt that point Valancy laughed. Nobody else laughed. What was there to\r\nlaugh at?\r\n\r\n“Is that a vital part?” asked Valancy.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” said bewildered Aunt Alberta, and Mrs. Frederick\r\nwas almost driven to believe that she had served God all her years for\r\nnaught.\r\n\r\nAunt Isabel concluded that it was up to her to suppress Valancy.\r\n\r\n“Doss, you are horribly thin,” she said. “You are _all_ corners. Do you\r\n_ever_ try to fatten up a little?”\r\n\r\n“No.” Valancy was not asking quarter or giving it. “But I can tell you\r\nwhere you’ll find a beauty parlor in Port Lawrence where they can\r\nreduce the number of your chins.”\r\n\r\n“_Val-an-cy!_” The protest was wrung from Mrs. Frederick. She meant her\r\ntone to be stately and majestic, as usual, but it sounded more like an\r\nimploring whine. And she did not say “Doss.”\r\n\r\n“She’s feverish,” said Cousin Stickles to Uncle Benjamin in an agonised\r\nwhisper. “We’ve thought she’s seemed feverish for several days.”\r\n\r\n“She’s gone dippy, in my opinion,” growled Uncle Benjamin. “If not, she\r\nought to be spanked. Yes, spanked.”\r\n\r\n“You can’t spank her.” Cousin Stickles was much agitated. “She’s\r\ntwenty-nine years old.”\r\n\r\n“So there is that advantage, at least, in being twenty-nine,” said\r\nValancy, whose ears had caught this aside.\r\n\r\n“Doss,” said Uncle Benjamin, “when I am dead you may say what you\r\nplease. As long as I am alive I demand to be treated with respect.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but you know we’re all dead,” said Valancy, “the whole Stirling\r\nclan. Some of us are buried and some aren’t—yet. That is the only\r\ndifference.”\r\n\r\n“Doss,” said Uncle Benjamin, thinking it might cow Valancy, “do you\r\nremember the time you stole the raspberry jam?”\r\n\r\nValancy flushed scarlet—with suppressed laughter, not shame. She had\r\nbeen sure Uncle Benjamin would drag that jam in somehow.\r\n\r\n“Of course I do,” she said. “It was good jam. I’ve always been sorry I\r\nhadn’t time to eat more of it before you found me. Oh, _look_ at Aunt\r\nIsabel’s profile on the wall. Did you ever see anything so funny?”\r\n\r\nEverybody looked, including Aunt Isabel herself, which of course,\r\ndestroyed it. But Uncle Herbert said kindly, “I—I wouldn’t eat any more\r\nif I were you, Doss. It isn’t that I grudge it—but don’t you think it\r\nwould be better for yourself? Your—your stomach seems a little out of\r\norder.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t worry about my stomach, old dear,” said Valancy. “It is all\r\nright. I’m going to keep right on eating. It’s so seldom I get the\r\nchance of a satisfying meal.”\r\n\r\nIt was the first time any one had been called “old dear” in Deerwood.\r\nThe Stirlings thought Valancy had invented the phrase and they were\r\nafraid of her from that moment. There was something so uncanny about\r\nsuch an expression. But in poor Mrs. Frederick’s opinion the reference\r\nto a satisfying meal was the worst thing Valancy had said yet. Valancy\r\nhad always been a disappointment to her. Now she was a disgrace. She\r\nthought she would have to get up and go away from the table. Yet she\r\ndared not leave Valancy there.\r\n\r\nAunt Alberta’s maid came in to remove the salad plates and bring in the\r\ndessert. It was a welcome diversion. Everybody brightened up with a\r\ndetermination to ignore Valancy and talk as if she wasn’t there. Uncle\r\nWellington mentioned Barney Snaith. Eventually somebody did mention\r\nBarney Snaith at every Stirling function, Valancy reflected. Whatever\r\nhe was, he was an individual that could not be ignored. She resigned\r\nherself to listen. There was a subtle fascination in the subject for\r\nher, though she had not yet faced this fact. She could feel her pulses\r\nbeating to her finger-tips.\r\n\r\nOf course they abused him. Nobody ever had a good word to say of Barney\r\nSnaith. All the old, wild tales were canvassed—the defaulting\r\ncashier-counterfeiter-infidel-murderer-in-hiding legends were thrashed\r\nout. Uncle Wellington was very indignant that such a creature should be\r\nallowed to exist at all in the neighbourhood of Deerwood. He didn’t\r\nknow what the police at Port Lawrence were thinking of. Everybody would\r\nbe murdered in their beds some night. It was a shame that he should be\r\nallowed to be at large after all that he had done.\r\n\r\n“What _has_ he done?” asked Valancy suddenly.\r\n\r\nUncle Wellington stared at her, forgetting that she was to be ignored.\r\n\r\n“Done! Done! He’s done _everything_.”\r\n\r\n“_What_ has he done?” repeated Valancy inexorably. “What do you _know_\r\nthat he has done? You’re always running him down. And what has ever\r\nbeen proved against him?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t argue with women,” said Uncle Wellington. “And I don’t need\r\nproof. When a man hides himself up there on an island in Muskoka, year\r\nin and year out, and nobody can find out where he came from or how he\r\nlives, or what he does there, _that’s_ proof enough. Find a mystery and\r\nyou find a crime.”\r\n\r\n“The very idea of a man named Snaith!” said Second Cousin Sarah. “Why,\r\nthe name itself is enough to condemn him!”\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t like to meet him in a dark lane,” shivered Cousin\r\nGeorgiana.\r\n\r\n“What do you suppose he would do to you?” asked Valancy.\r\n\r\n“Murder me,” said Cousin Georgiana solemnly.\r\n\r\n“Just for the fun of it?” suggested Valancy.\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” said Cousin Georgiana unsuspiciously. “When there is so much\r\nsmoke there must be some fire. I was afraid he was a criminal when he\r\ncame here first. I _felt_ he had something to hide. I am not often\r\nmistaken in my intuitions.”\r\n\r\n“Criminal! Of course he’s a criminal,” said Uncle Wellington. “Nobody\r\ndoubts it”—glaring at Valancy. “Why, they say he served a term in the\r\npenitentiary for embezzlement. I don’t doubt it. And they say he’s in\r\nwith that gang that are perpetrating all those bank robberies round the\r\ncountry.”\r\n\r\n“_Who_ say?” asked Valancy.\r\n\r\nUncle Wellington knotted his ugly forehead at her. What had got into\r\nthis confounded girl, anyway? He ignored the question.\r\n\r\n“He has the identical look of a jail-bird,” snapped Uncle Benjamin. “I\r\nnoticed it the first time I saw him.”\r\n\r\n“‘A fellow by the hand of nature marked,\r\nQuoted and signed to do a deed of shame’,”\r\n\ndeclaimed Uncle James. He looked enormously pleased over managing to\r\nwork that quotation in at last. He had been waiting all his life for\r\nthe chance.\r\n\r\n“One of his eyebrows is an arch and the other is a triangle,” said\r\nValancy. “Is _that_ why you think him so villainous?”\r\n\r\nUncle James lifted _his_ eyebrows. Generally when Uncle James lifted\r\nhis eyebrows the world came to an end. This time it continued to\r\nfunction.\r\n\r\n“How do _you_ know his eyebrows so well, Doss?” asked Olive, a trifle\r\nmaliciously. Such a remark would have covered Valancy with confusion\r\ntwo weeks ago, and Olive knew it.\r\n\r\n“Yes, how?” demanded Aunt Wellington.\r\n\r\n“I’ve seen him twice and I looked at him closely,” said Valancy\r\ncomposedly. “I thought his face the most interesting one I ever saw.”\r\n\r\n“There is no doubt there is something fishy in the creature’s past\r\nlife,” said Olive, who began to think she was decidedly out of the\r\nconversation, which had centred so amazingly around Valancy. “But he\r\ncan hardly be guilty of _everything_ he’s accused of, you know.”\r\n\r\nValancy felt annoyed with Olive. Why should _she_ speak up in even this\r\nqualified defence of Barney Snaith? What had _she_ to do with him? For\r\nthat matter, what had Valancy? But Valancy did not ask herself this\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n“They say he keeps dozens of cats in that hut up back on Mistawis,”\r\nsaid Second Cousin Sarah Taylor, by way of appearing not entirely\r\nignorant of him.\r\n\r\nCats. It sounded quite alluring to Valancy, in the plural. She pictured\r\nan island in Muskoka haunted by pussies.\r\n\r\n“That alone shows there is something wrong with him,” decreed Aunt\r\nIsabel.\r\n\r\n“People who don’t like cats,” said Valancy, attacking her dessert with\r\na relish, “always seem to think that there is some peculiar virtue in\r\nnot liking them.”\r\n\r\n“The man hasn’t a friend except Roaring Abel,” said Uncle Wellington.\r\n“And if Roaring Abel had kept away from him, as everybody else did, it\r\nwould have been better for—for some members of his family.”\r\n\r\nUncle Wellington’s rather lame conclusion was due to a marital glance\r\nfrom Aunt Wellington reminding him of what he had almost forgotten—that\r\nthere were girls at the table.\r\n\r\n“If you mean,” said Valancy passionately, “that Barney Snaith is the\r\nfather of Cecily Gay’s child, he _isn’t_. It’s a wicked lie.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of her indignation Valancy was hugely amused at the expression\r\nof the faces around that festal table. She had not seen anything like\r\nit since the day, seventeen years ago, when at Cousin Gladys’ thimble\r\nparty, they discovered that she had got—SOMETHING—in her head at\r\nschool. _Lice_ in her head! Valancy was done with euphemisms.\r\n\r\nPoor Mrs. Frederick was almost in a state of collapse. She had\r\nbelieved—or pretended to believe—that Valancy still supposed that\r\nchildren were found in parsley beds.\r\n\r\n“Hush—hush!” implored Cousin Stickles.\r\n\r\n“I don’t mean to hush,” said Valancy perversely. “I’ve hush-hushed all\r\nmy life. I’ll scream if I want to. Don’t make me want to. And stop\r\ntalking nonsense about Barney Snaith.”\r\n\r\nValancy didn’t exactly understand her own indignation. What did Barney\r\nSnaith’s imputed crimes and misdemeanours matter to her? And why, out\r\nof them all, did it seem most intolerable that he should have been\r\npoor, pitiful little Cecily Gay’s false lover? For it _did_ seem\r\nintolerable to her. She did not mind when they called him a thief and a\r\ncounterfeiter and jail-bird; but she could not endure to think that he\r\nhad loved and ruined Cecily Gay. She recalled his face on the two\r\noccasions of their chance meetings—his twisted, enigmatic, engaging\r\nsmile, his twinkle, his thin, sensitive, almost ascetic lips, his\r\ngeneral air of frank daredeviltry. A man with such a smile and lips\r\nmight have murdered or stolen but he could not have betrayed. She\r\nsuddenly hated every one who said it or believed it of him.\r\n\r\n“When _I_ was a young girl I never thought or spoke about such matters,\r\nDoss,” said Aunt Wellington, crushingly.\r\n\r\n“But I’m not a young girl,” retorted Valancy, uncrushed. “Aren’t you\r\nalways rubbing that into me? And you are all evil-minded, senseless\r\ngossips. Can’t you leave poor Cissy Gay alone? She’s dying. Whatever\r\nshe did, God or the Devil has punished her enough for it. _You_ needn’t\r\ntake a hand, too. As for Barney Snaith, the only crime he has been\r\nguilty of is living to himself and minding his own business. He can, it\r\nseems, get along without you. Which _is_ an unpardonable sin, of\r\ncourse, in your little snobocracy.” Valancy coined that concluding word\r\nsuddenly and felt that it was an inspiration. That was exactly what\r\nthey were and not one of them was fit to mend another.\r\n\r\n“Valancy, your poor father would turn over in his grave if he could\r\nhear you,” said Mrs. Frederick.\r\n\r\n“I dare say he would like that for a change,” said Valancy brazenly.\r\n\r\n“Doss,” said Uncle James heavily, “the Ten Commandments are fairly up\r\nto date still—especially the fifth. Have you forgotten that?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Valancy, “but I thought _you_ had—especially the ninth. Have\r\nyou ever thought, Uncle James, how dull life would be without the Ten\r\nCommandments? It is only when things are forbidden that they become\r\nfascinating.”\r\n\r\nBut her excitement had been too much for her. She knew, by certain\r\nunmistakable warnings, that one of her attacks of pain was coming on.\r\nIt must not find her there. She rose from her chair.\r\n\r\n“I am going home now. I only came for the dinner. It was very good,\r\nAunt Alberta, although your salad-dressing is not salt enough and a\r\ndash of cayenne would improve it.”\r\n\r\nNone of the flabbergasted silver wedding guests could think of anything\r\nto say until the lawn gate clanged behind Valancy in the dusk. Then—\r\n\r\n“She’s feverish—I’ve said right along she was feverish,” moaned Cousin\r\nStickles.\r\n\r\nUncle Benjamin punished his pudgy left hand fiercely with his pudgy\r\nright.\r\n\r\n“She’s dippy—I tell you she’s gone dippy,” he snorted angrily. “That’s\r\nall there is about it. Clean dippy.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Benjamin,” said Cousin Georgiana soothingly, “don’t condemn her\r\ntoo rashly. We _must_ remember what dear old Shakespeare says—that\r\ncharity thinketh no evil.”\r\n\r\n“Charity! Poppy-cock!” snorted Uncle Benjamin. “I never heard a young\r\nwoman talk such stuff in my life as she just did. Talking about things\r\nshe ought to be ashamed to think of, much less mention. Blaspheming!\r\nInsulting _us_! What she wants is a generous dose of spank-weed and I’d\r\nlike to be the one to administer it. H-uh-h-h-h!” Uncle Benjamin gulped\r\ndown the half of a scalding cup of coffee.\r\n\r\n“Do you suppose that the mumps could work on a person that way?” wailed\r\nCousin Stickles.\r\n\r\n“I opened an umbrella in the house yesterday,” sniffed Cousin\r\nGeorgiana. “I _knew_ it betokened some misfortune.”\r\n\r\n“Have you tried to find out if she has a temperature?” asked Cousin\r\nMildred.\r\n\r\n“She wouldn’t let Amelia put the thermometer under her tongue,”\r\nwhimpered Cousin Stickles.\r\n\r\nMrs. Frederick was openly in tears. All her defences were down.\r\n\r\n“I must tell you,” she sobbed, “that Valancy has been acting very\r\nstrangely for over two weeks now. She hasn’t been a bit like\r\nherself—Christine could tell you. I have hoped against hope that it was\r\nonly one of her colds coming on. But it is—it must be something worse.”\r\n\r\n“This is bringing on my neuritis again,” said Cousin Gladys, putting\r\nher hand to her head.\r\n\r\n“Don’t cry, Amelia,” said Herbert kindly, pulling nervously at his\r\nspiky grey hair. He hated “family ructions.” Very inconsiderate of Doss\r\nto start one at _his_ silver wedding. Who could have supposed she had\r\nit in her? “You’ll have to take her to a doctor. This may be only\r\na—er—a brainstorm. There are such things as brainstorms nowadays,\r\naren’t there?”\r\n\r\n“I—I suggested consulting a doctor to her yesterday,” moaned Mrs.\r\nFrederick. “And she said she wouldn’t go to a doctor—wouldn’t. Oh,\r\nsurely I have had trouble enough!”\r\n\r\n“And she _won’t_ take Redfern’s Bitters,” said Cousin Stickles.\r\n\r\n“Or _anything_,” said Mrs. Frederick.\r\n\r\n“And she’s determined to go to the Presbyterian church,” said Cousin\r\nStickles—repressing, however, to her credit be it said, the story of\r\nthe bannister.\r\n\r\n“That proves she’s dippy,” growled Uncle Benjamin. “I noticed something\r\nstrange about her the minute she came in today. I noticed it _before_\r\ntoday.” (Uncle Benjamin was thinking of “m-i-r-a-z-h.”) “Everything she\r\nsaid today showed an unbalanced mind. That question—‘Was it a vital\r\npart?’ Was there any sense at all in that remark? None whatever! There\r\nnever was anything like that in the Stirlings. It must be from the\r\nWansbarras.”\r\n\r\nPoor Mrs. Frederick was too crushed to be indignant.\r\n\r\n“I never heard of anything like that in the Wansbarras,” she sobbed.\r\n\r\n“Your father was odd enough,” said Uncle Benjamin.\r\n\r\n“Poor Pa was—peculiar,” admitted Mrs. Frederick tearfully, “but his\r\nmind was never affected.”\r\n\r\n“He talked all his life exactly as Valancy did today,” retorted Uncle\r\nBenjamin. “And he believed he was his own great-great grandfather born\r\nover again. I’ve heard him say it. Don’t tell _me_ that a man who\r\nbelieved a thing like _that_ was ever in his right senses. Come, come,\r\nAmelia, stop sniffling. Of course Doss has made a terrible exhibition\r\nof herself today, but she’s not responsible. Old maids are apt to fly\r\noff at a tangent like that. If she had been married when she should\r\nhave been she wouldn’t have got like this.”\r\n\r\n“Nobody wanted to marry her,” said Mrs. Frederick, who felt that,\r\nsomehow, Uncle Benjamin was blaming her.\r\n\r\n“Well, fortunately there’s no outsider here,” snapped Uncle Benjamin.\r\n“We may keep it in the family yet. I’ll take her over to see Dr. Marsh\r\ntomorrow. _I_ know how to deal with pig-headed people. Won’t that be\r\nbest, James?”\r\n\r\n“We must have medical advice certainly,” agreed Uncle James.\r\n\r\n“Well, that’s settled. In the meantime, Amelia, act as if nothing had\r\nhappened and keep an eye on her. Don’t let her be alone. Above all,\r\ndon’t let her sleep alone.”\r\n\r\nRenewed whimpers from Mrs. Frederick.\r\n\r\n“I can’t help it. Night before last I suggested she’d better have\r\nChristine sleep with her. She positively refused—_and locked her door_.\r\nOh, you don’t know how she’s changed. She won’t work. At least, she\r\nwon’t sew. She does her usual housework, of course. But she wouldn’t\r\nsweep the parlour yesterday morning, though we _always_ sweep it on\r\nThursdays. She said she’d wait till it was dirty. ‘Would you rather\r\nsweep a dirty room than a clean one?’ I asked her. She said, ‘Of\r\ncourse. I’d see something for my labour then.’ Think of it!”\r\n\r\nUncle Benjamin thought of it.\r\n\r\n“The jar of potpourri”—Cousin Stickles pronounced it as spelled—“has\r\ndisappeared from her room. I found the pieces in the next lot. She\r\nwon’t tell us what happened to it.”\r\n\r\n“I should never have dreamed it of Doss,” said Uncle Herbert. “She has\r\nalways seemed such a quiet, sensible girl. A bit backward—but\r\nsensible.”\r\n\r\n“The only thing you can be sure of in this world is the multiplication\r\ntable,” said Uncle James, feeling cleverer than ever.\r\n\r\n“Well, let’s cheer up,” suggested Uncle Benjamin. “Why are chorus girls\r\nlike fine stock raisers?”\r\n\r\n“Why?” asked Cousin Stickles, since it had to be asked and Valancy\r\nwasn’t there to ask it.\r\n\r\n“Like to exhibit calves,” chuckled Uncle Benjamin.\r\n\r\nCousin Stickles thought Uncle Benjamin a little indelicate. Before\r\nOlive, too. But then, he was a man.\r\n\r\nUncle Herbert was thinking that things were rather dull now that Doss\r\nhad gone."

      "content": "Valancy hurried home through the faint blue twilight—hurried too fast\r\nperhaps. The attack she had when she thankfully reached the shelter of\r\nher own room was the worst yet. It was really very bad. She might die\r\nin one of those spells. It would be dreadful to die in such pain.\r\nPerhaps—perhaps this was death. Valancy felt pitifully alone. When she\r\ncould think at all she wondered what it would be like to have some one\r\nwith her who could sympathise—some one who really cared—just to hold\r\nher hand tight, if nothing else—some one just to say, “Yes, I know.\r\nIt’s dreadful—be brave—you’ll soon be better;” not some one merely\r\nfussy and alarmed. Not her mother or Cousin Stickles. Why did the\r\nthought of Barney Snaith come into her mind? Why did she suddenly feel,\r\nin the midst of this hideous loneliness of pain, that _he_ would be\r\nsympathetic—sorry for any one that was suffering? Why did he seem to\r\nher like an old, well-known friend? Was it because she had been\r\ndefending him—standing up to her family for him?\r\n\r\nShe was so bad at first that she could not even get herself a dose of\r\nDr. Trent’s prescription. But eventually she managed it, and soon after\r\nrelief came. The pain left her and she lay on her bed, spent,\r\nexhausted, in a cold perspiration. Oh, that had been horrible! She\r\ncould not endure many more attacks like that. One didn’t mind dying if\r\ndeath could be instant and painless. But to be hurt so in dying!\r\n\r\nSuddenly she found herself laughing. That dinner _had_ been fun. And it\r\nhad all been so simple. She had merely _said_ the things she had always\r\n_thought_. Their faces—oh, their faces! Uncle Benjamin—poor,\r\nflabbergasted Uncle Benjamin! Valancy felt quite sure he would make a\r\nnew will that very night. Olive would get Valancy’s share of his fat\r\nhoard. Olive had always got Valancy’s share of everything. Remember the\r\ndust-pile.\r\n\r\nTo laugh at her clan as she had always wanted to laugh was all the\r\nsatisfaction she could get out of life now. But she thought it was\r\nrather pitiful that it should be so. Might she not pity herself a\r\nlittle when nobody else did?\r\n\r\nValancy got up and went to her window. The moist, beautiful wind\r\nblowing across groves of young-leafed wild trees touched her face with\r\nthe caress of a wise, tender, old friend. The lombardies in Mrs.\r\nTredgold’s lawn, off to the left—Valancy could just see them between\r\nthe stable and the old carriage-shop—were in dark purple silhouette\r\nagainst a clear sky and there was a milk-white, pulsating star just\r\nover one of them, like a living pearl on a silver-green lake. Far\r\nbeyond the station were the shadowy, purple-hooded woods around Lake\r\nMistawis. A white, filmy mist hung over them and just above it was a\r\nfaint, young crescent. Valancy looked at it over her thin left\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n“I wish,” she said whimsically, “that I may have _one_ little dust-pile\r\nbefore I die.”"

      "content": "Uncle Benjamin found he had reckoned without his host when he promised\r\nso airily to take Valancy to a doctor. Valancy would not go. Valancy\r\nlaughed in his face.\r\n\r\n“Why on earth should I go to Dr. Marsh? There’s nothing the matter with\r\nmy mind. Though you all think I’ve suddenly gone crazy. Well, I\r\nhaven’t. I’ve simply grown tired of living to please other people and\r\nhave decided to please myself. It will give you something to talk about\r\nbesides my stealing the raspberry jam. So that’s that.”\r\n\r\n“Doss,” said Uncle Benjamin, solemnly and helplessly, “you are not—like\r\nyourself.”\r\n\r\n“Who am I like, then?” asked Valancy.\r\n\r\nUncle Benjamin was rather posed.\r\n\r\n“Your Grandfather Wansbarra,” he answered desperately.\r\n\r\n“Thanks.” Valancy looked pleased. “That’s a real compliment. I remember\r\nGrandfather Wansbarra. He was one of the few human beings I _have_\r\nknown—almost the only one. Now, it is of no use to scold or entreat or\r\ncommand, Uncle Benjamin—or exchange anguished glances with Mother and\r\nCousin Stickles. I am not going to any doctor. And if you bring any\r\ndoctor here I won’t see him. So what are you going to do about it?”\r\n\r\nWhat indeed! It was not seemly—or even possible—to hale Valancy\r\ndoctorwards by physical force. And in no other way could it be done,\r\nseemingly. Her mother’s tears and imploring entreaties availed not.\r\n\r\n“Don’t worry, Mother,” said Valancy, lightly but quite respectfully.\r\n“It isn’t likely I’ll do anything very terrible. But I mean to have a\r\nlittle fun.”\r\n\r\n“Fun!” Mrs. Frederick uttered the word as if Valancy had said she was\r\ngoing to have a little tuberculosis.\r\n\r\nOlive, sent by her mother to see if _she_ had any influence over\r\nValancy, came away with flushed cheeks and angry eyes. She told her\r\nmother that nothing could be done with Valancy. After _she_, Olive, had\r\ntalked to her just like a sister, tenderly and wisely, all Valancy had\r\nsaid, narrowing her funny eyes to mere slips, was, “_I_ don’t show my\r\ngums when I laugh.”\r\n\r\n“More as if she were talking to herself than to me. Indeed, Mother, all\r\nthe time I was talking to her she gave me the impression of not really\r\nlistening. And that wasn’t all. When I finally decided that what I was\r\nsaying had no influence over her I begged her, when Cecil came next\r\nweek, not to say anything queer before him, at least. Mother, what do\r\nyou think she said?”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure I can’t imagine,” groaned Aunt Wellington, prepared for\r\nanything.\r\n\r\n“She said, ‘I’d rather like to shock Cecil. His mouth is too red for a\r\nman’s.’ Mother, I can never feel the same to Valancy again.”\r\n\r\n“Her mind is affected, Olive,” said Aunt Wellington solemnly. “You must\r\nnot hold her responsible for what she says.”\r\n\r\nWhen Aunt Wellington told Mrs. Frederick what Valancy had said to\r\nOlive, Mrs. Frederick wanted Valancy to apologise.\r\n\r\n“You made me apologise to Olive fifteen years ago for something I\r\ndidn’t do,” said Valancy. “That old apology will do for now.”\r\n\r\nAnother solemn family conclave was held. They were all there except\r\nCousin Gladys, who had been suffering such tortures of neuritis in her\r\nhead “ever since poor Doss went queer” that she couldn’t undertake any\r\nresponsibility. They decided—that is, they accepted a fact that was\r\nthrust in their faces—that the wisest thing was to leave Valancy alone\r\nfor a while—“give her her head” as Uncle Benjamin expressed it—“keep a\r\ncareful eye on her but let her pretty much alone.” The term of\r\n“watchful waiting” had not been invented then, but that was practically\r\nthe policy Valancy’s distracted relatives decided to follow.\r\n\r\n“We must be guided by developments,” said Uncle Benjamin. “It\r\nis”—solemnly—“easier to scramble eggs than unscramble them. Of\r\ncourse—if she becomes violent——”\r\n\r\nUncle James consulted Dr. Ambrose Marsh. Dr. Ambrose Marsh approved\r\ntheir decision. He pointed out to irate Uncle James—who would have\r\nliked to lock Valancy up somewhere, out of hand—that Valancy had not,\r\nas yet, really done or said anything that could be construed as proof\r\nof lunacy—and without proof you cannot lock people up in this\r\ndegenerate age. Nothing that Uncle James had reported seemed very\r\nalarming to Dr. Marsh, who put up his hand to conceal a smile several\r\ntimes. But then he himself was not a Stirling. And he knew very little\r\nabout the old Valancy. Uncle James stalked out and drove back to\r\nDeerwood, thinking that Ambrose Marsh wasn’t much of a doctor, after\r\nall, and that Adelaide Stirling might have done better for herself."

      "content": "Life cannot stop because tragedy enters it. Meals must be made ready\r\nthough a son dies and porches must be repaired even if your only\r\ndaughter is going out of her mind. Mrs. Frederick, in her systematic\r\nway, had long ago appointed the second week in June for the repairing\r\nof the front porch, the roof of which was sagging dangerously. Roaring\r\nAbel had been engaged to do it many moons before and Roaring Abel\r\npromptly appeared on the morning of the first day of the second week,\r\nand fell to work. Of course he was drunk. Roaring Abel was never\r\nanything but drunk. But he was only in the first stage, which made him\r\ntalkative and genial. The odour of whisky on his breath nearly drove\r\nMrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles wild at dinner. Even Valancy, with\r\nall her emancipation, did not like it. But she liked Abel and she liked\r\nhis vivid, eloquent talk, and after she washed the dinner dishes she\r\nwent out and sat on the steps and talked to him.\r\n\r\nMrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles thought it a terrible proceeding,\r\nbut what could they do? Valancy only smiled mockingly at them when they\r\ncalled her in, and did not go. It was so easy to defy once you got\r\nstarted. The first step was the only one that really counted. They were\r\nboth afraid to say anything more to her lest she might make a scene\r\nbefore Roaring Abel, who would spread it all over the country with his\r\nown characteristic comments and exaggerations. It was too cold a day,\r\nin spite of the June sunshine, for Mrs. Frederick to sit at the\r\ndining-room window and listen to what was said. She had to shut the\r\nwindow and Valancy and Roaring Abel had their talk to themselves. But\r\nif Mrs. Frederick had known what the outcome of that talk was to be she\r\nwould have prevented it, if the porch was never repaired.\r\n\r\nValancy sat on the steps, defiant of the chill breeze of this cold June\r\nwhich had made Aunt Isabel aver the seasons were changing. She did not\r\ncare whether she caught a cold or not. It was delightful to sit there\r\nin that cold, beautiful, fragrant world and feel free. She filled her\r\nlungs with the clean, lovely wind and held out her arms to it and let\r\nit tear her hair to pieces while she listened to Roaring Abel, who told\r\nher his troubles between intervals of hammering gaily in time to his\r\nScotch songs. Valancy liked to hear him. Every stroke of his hammer\r\nfell true to the note.\r\n\r\nOld Abel Gay, in spite of his seventy years, was handsome still, in a\r\nstately, patriarchal manner. His tremendous beard, falling down over\r\nhis blue flannel shirt, was still a flaming, untouched red, though his\r\nshock of hair was white as snow, and his eyes were a fiery, youthful\r\nblue. His enormous, reddish-white eyebrows were more like moustaches\r\nthan eyebrows. Perhaps this was why he always kept his upper lip\r\nscrupulously shaved. His cheeks were red and his nose ought to have\r\nbeen, but wasn’t. It was a fine, upstanding, aquiline nose, such as the\r\nnoblest Roman of them all might have rejoiced in. Abel was six feet two\r\nin his stockings, broad-shouldered, lean-hipped. In his youth he had\r\nbeen a famous lover, finding all women too charming to bind himself to\r\none. His years had been a wild, colourful panorama of follies and\r\nadventures, gallantries, fortunes and misfortunes. He had been\r\nforty-five before he married—a pretty slip of a girl whom his goings-on\r\nkilled in a few years. Abel was piously drunk at her funeral and\r\ninsisted on repeating the fifty-fifth chapter of Isaiah—Abel knew most\r\nof the Bible and all the Psalms by heart—while the minister, whom he\r\ndisliked, prayed or tried to pray. Thereafter his house was run by an\r\nuntidy old cousin who cooked his meals and kept things going after a\r\nfashion. In this unpromising environment little Cecilia Gay had grown\r\nup.\r\n\r\nValancy had known “Cissy Gay” fairly well in the democracy of the\r\npublic school, though Cissy had been three years younger than she.\r\nAfter they left school their paths diverged and she had seen nothing of\r\nher. Old Abel was a Presbyterian. That is, he got a Presbyterian\r\npreacher to marry him, baptise his child and bury his wife; and he knew\r\nmore about Presbyterian theology than most ministers, which made him a\r\nterror to them in arguments. But Roaring Abel never went to church.\r\nEvery Presbyterian minister who had been in Deerwood had tried his\r\nhand—once—at reforming Roaring Abel. But he had not been pestered of\r\nlate. Rev. Mr. Bently had been in Deerwood for eight years, but he had\r\nnot sought out Roaring Abel since the first three months of his\r\npastorate. He had called on Roaring Abel then and found him in the\r\ntheological stage of drunkenness—which always followed the sentimental\r\nmaudlin one, and preceded the roaring, blasphemous one. The eloquently\r\nprayerful one, in which he realised himself temporarily and intensely\r\nas a sinner in the hands of an angry God, was the final one. Abel never\r\nwent beyond it. He generally fell asleep on his knees and awakened\r\nsober, but he had never been “dead drunk” in his life. He told Mr.\r\nBently that he was a sound Presbyterian and sure of his election. He\r\nhad no sins—that he knew of—to repent of.\r\n\r\n“Have you never done anything in your life that you are sorry for?”\r\nasked Mr. Bently.\r\n\r\nRoaring Abel scratched his bushy white head and pretended to reflect.\r\n\r\n“Well, yes,” he said finally. “There were some women I might have\r\nkissed and didn’t. I’ve always been sorry for _that_.”\r\n\r\nMr. Bently went out and went home.\r\n\r\nAbel had seen that Cissy was properly baptised—jovially drunk at the\r\nsame time himself. He made her go to church and Sunday School\r\nregularly. The church people took her up and she was in turn a member\r\nof the Mission Band, the Girls’ Guild and the Young Women’s Missionary\r\nSociety. She was a faithful, unobtrusive, sincere, little worker.\r\nEverybody liked Cissy Gay and was sorry for her. She was so modest and\r\nsensitive and pretty in that delicate, elusive fashion of beauty which\r\nfades so quickly if life is not kept in it by love and tenderness. But\r\nthen liking and pity did not prevent them from tearing her in pieces\r\nlike hungry cats when the catastrophe came. Four years previously Cissy\r\nGay had gone up to a Muskoka hotel as a summer waitress. And when she\r\nhad come back in the fall she was a changed creature. She hid herself\r\naway and went nowhere. The reason soon leaked out and scandal raged.\r\nThat winter Cissy’s baby was born. Nobody ever knew who the father was.\r\nCecily kept her poor pale lips tightly locked on her sorry secret.\r\nNobody dared ask Roaring Abel any questions about it. Rumour and\r\nsurmise laid the guilt at Barney Snaith’s door because diligent inquiry\r\namong the other maids at the hotel revealed the fact that nobody there\r\nhad ever seen Cissy Gay “with a fellow.” She had “kept herself to\r\nherself” they said, rather resentfully. “Too good for _our_ dances. And\r\nnow look!”\r\n\r\nThe baby had lived for a year. After its death Cissy faded away. Two\r\nyears ago Dr. Marsh had given her only six months to live—her lungs\r\nwere hopelessly diseased. But she was still alive. Nobody went to see\r\nher. Women would not go to Roaring Abel’s house. Mr. Bently had gone\r\nonce, when he knew Abel was away, but the dreadful old creature who was\r\nscrubbing the kitchen floor told him Cissy wouldn’t see any one. The\r\nold cousin had died and Roaring Abel had had two or three disreputable\r\nhousekeepers—the only kind who could be prevailed on to go to a house\r\nwhere a girl was dying of consumption. But the last one had left and\r\nRoaring Abel had now no one to wait on Cissy and “do” for him. This was\r\nthe burden of his plaint to Valancy and he condemned the “hypocrites”\r\nof Deerwood and its surrounding communities with some rich, meaty oaths\r\nthat happened to reach Cousin Stickles’ ears as she passed through the\r\nhall and nearly finished the poor lady. Was Valancy listening to\r\n_that_?\r\n\r\nValancy hardly noticed the profanity. Her attention was focussed on the\r\nhorrible thought of poor, unhappy, disgraced little Cissy Gay, ill and\r\nhelpless in that forlorn old house out on the Mistawis road, without a\r\nsoul to help or comfort her. And this in a nominally Christian\r\ncommunity in the year of grace nineteen and some odd!\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to say that Cissy is all alone there now, with nobody to\r\ndo anything for her—_nobody_?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, she can move about a bit and get a bite and sup when she wants it.\r\nBut she can’t work. It’s d——d hard for a man to work hard all day and\r\ngo home at night tired and hungry and cook his own meals. Sometimes I’m\r\nsorry I kicked old Rachel Edwards out.” Abel described Rachel\r\npicturesquely.\r\n\r\n“Her face looked as if it had wore out a hundred bodies. And she moped.\r\nTalk about temper! Temper’s nothing to moping. She was too slow to\r\ncatch worms, and dirty—d——d dirty. I ain’t unreasonable—I know a man\r\nhas to eat his peck before he dies—but she went over the limit. What\r\nd’ye sp’ose I saw that lady do? She’d made some punkin jam—had it on\r\nthe table in glass jars with the tops off. The dawg got up on the table\r\nand stuck his paw into one of them. What did she do? She jest took holt\r\nof the dawg and wrung the syrup off his paw back into the jar! Then\r\nscrewed the top on and set it in the pantry. I sets open the door and\r\nsays to her, ‘Go!’ The dame went, and I fired the jars of punkin after\r\nher, two at a time. Thought I’d die laughing to see old Rachel run—with\r\nthem punkin jars raining after her. She’s told everywhere I’m crazy, so\r\nnobody’ll come for love or money.”\r\n\r\n“But Cissy _must_ have some one to look after her,” insisted Valancy,\r\nwhose mind was centred on this aspect of the case. She did not care\r\nwhether Roaring Abel had any one to cook for him or not. But her heart\r\nwas wrung for Cecilia Gay.\r\n\r\n“Oh, she gits on. Barney Snaith always drops in when he’s passing and\r\ndoes anything she wants done. Brings her oranges and flowers and\r\nthings. There’s a Christian for you. Yet that sanctimonious, snivelling\r\nparcel of St. Andrew’s people wouldn’t be seen on the same side of the\r\nroad with him. Their dogs’ll go to heaven before they do. And their\r\nminister—slick as if the cat had licked him!”\r\n\r\n“There are plenty of good people, both in St. Andrew’s and St.\r\nGeorge’s, who would be kind to Cissy if _you_ would behave yourself,”\r\nsaid Valancy severely. “They’re afraid to go near your place.”\r\n\r\n“Because I’m such a sad old dog? But I don’t bite—never bit any one in\r\nmy life. A few loose words spilled around don’t hurt any one. And I’m\r\nnot asking people to come. Don’t want ’em poking and prying about. What\r\nI want is a housekeeper. If I shaved every Sunday and went to church\r\nI’d get all the housekeepers I’d want. I’d be respectable then. But\r\nwhat’s the use of going to church when it’s all settled by\r\npredestination? Tell me that, Miss.”\r\n\r\n“Is it?” said Valancy.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Can’t git around it nohow. Wish I could. I don’t want either\r\nheaven or hell for steady. Wish a man could have ’em mixed in equal\r\nproportions.”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t that the way it is in this world?” said Valancy\r\nthoughtfully—but rather as if her thought was concerned with something\r\nelse than theology.\r\n\r\n“No, no,” boomed Abel, striking a tremendous blow on a stubborn nail.\r\n“There’s too much hell here—entirely too much hell. That’s why I get\r\ndrunk so often. It sets you free for a little while—free from\r\nyourself—yes, by God, free from predestination. Ever try it?”\r\n\r\n“No, I’ve another way of getting free,” said Valancy absently. “But\r\nabout Cissy now. She _must_ have some one to look after her——”\r\n\r\n“What are you harping on Sis for? Seems to me you ain’t bothered much\r\nabout her up to now. You never even come to see her. And she used to\r\nlike you so well.”\r\n\r\n“I should have,” said Valancy. “But never mind. You couldn’t\r\nunderstand. The point is—you must have a housekeeper.”\r\n\r\n“Where am I to get one? I can pay decent wages if I could get a decent\r\nwoman. D’ye think I like old hags?”\r\n\r\n“Will I do?” said Valancy."

      "content": "“Let us be calm,” said Uncle Benjamin. “Let us be perfectly calm.”\r\n\r\n“Calm!” Mrs. Frederick wrung her hands. “How can I be calm—how could\r\nanybody be calm under such a disgrace as this?”\r\n\r\n“Why in the world did you let her go?” asked Uncle James.\r\n\r\n“_Let_ her! How could I stop her, James? It seems she packed the big\r\nvalise and sent it away with Roaring Abel when he went home after\r\nsupper, while Christine and I were out in the kitchen. Then Doss\r\nherself came down with her little satchel, dressed in her green serge\r\nsuit. I felt a terrible premonition. I can’t tell you how it was, but I\r\nseemed to _know_ that Doss was going to do something dreadful.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a pity you couldn’t have had your premonition a little sooner,”\r\nsaid Uncle Benjamin drily.\r\n\r\n“I said, ‘Doss, _where are you going_?’ and _she_ said, ‘I am going to\r\nlook for my Blue Castle.’”\r\n\r\n“Wouldn’t you think _that_ would convince Marsh that her mind is\r\naffected?” interjected Uncle James.\r\n\r\n“And _I_ said, ‘Valancy, what _do_ you mean?’ And _she_ said, ‘I am\r\ngoing to keep house for Roaring Abel and nurse Cissy. He will pay me\r\nthirty dollars a month.’ I wonder I didn’t drop dead on the spot.”\r\n\r\n“You shouldn’t have let her go—you shouldn’t have let her out of the\r\nhouse,” said Uncle James. “You should have locked the door—anything——”\r\n\r\n“She was between me and the front door. And you can’t realise how\r\ndetermined she was. She was like a rock. That’s the strangest thing of\r\nall about her. She used to be so good and obedient, and now she’s\r\nneither to hold nor bind. But I said _everything_ I could think of to\r\nbring her to her senses. I asked her if she had no regard for her\r\nreputation. I said to her solemnly, ‘Doss, when a woman’s reputation is\r\nonce smirched nothing can ever make it spotless again. Your character\r\nwill be gone for ever if you go to Roaring Abel’s to wait on a bad girl\r\nlike Sis Gay.’ And she said, ‘I don’t believe Cissy was a bad girl, but\r\nI don’t care if she was.’ Those were her very words, ‘I don’t care if\r\nshe was.’”\r\n\r\n“She has lost all sense of decency,” exploded Uncle Benjamin.\r\n\r\n“‘Cissy Gay is dying,’ she said, ‘and it’s a shame and disgrace that\r\nshe is dying in a Christian community with no one to do anything for\r\nher. Whatever she’s been or done, she’s a human being.’”\r\n\r\n“Well, you know, when it comes to that, I suppose she is,” said Uncle\r\nJames with the air of one making a splendid concession.\r\n\r\n“I asked Doss if she had no regard for appearances. She said, ‘I’ve\r\nbeen keeping up appearances all my life. Now I’m going in for\r\nrealities. Appearances can go hang!’ _Go hang!_”\r\n\r\n“An outrageous thing!” said Uncle Benjamin violently. “An outrageous\r\nthing!”\r\n\r\nWhich relieved his feelings, but didn’t help any one else.\r\n\r\nMrs. Frederick wept. Cousin Stickles took up the refrain between her\r\nmoans of despair.\r\n\r\n“I told her—we _both_ told her—that Roaring Abel had certainly killed\r\nhis wife in one of his drunken rages and would kill her. She laughed\r\nand said, ‘I’m not afraid of Roaring Abel. He won’t kill _me_, and he’s\r\ntoo old for me to be afraid of his gallantries.’ What did she mean?\r\nWhat _are_ gallantries?”\r\n\r\nMrs. Frederick saw that she must stop crying if she wanted to regain\r\ncontrol of the conversation.\r\n\r\n“_I_ said to her, ‘Valancy, if you have no regard for your own\r\nreputation and your family’s standing, have you none for _my_\r\nfeelings?’ She said, ‘None.’ Just like that, _‘None!’_”\r\n\r\n“Insane people never _do_ have any regard for other people’s feelings,”\r\nsaid Uncle Benjamin. “That’s one of the symptoms.”\r\n\r\n“I broke out into tears then, and she said, ‘Come now, Mother, be a\r\ngood sport. I’m going to do an act of Christian charity, and as for the\r\ndamage it will do my reputation, why, you know I haven’t any\r\nmatrimonial chances anyhow, so what does it matter?’ And with that she\r\nturned and went out.”\r\n\r\n“The last words I said to her,” said Cousin Stickles pathetically,\r\n“were, ‘Who will rub my back at nights now?’ And she said—she said—but\r\nno, I cannot repeat it.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense,” said Uncle Benjamin. “Out with it. This is no time to be\r\nsqueamish.”\r\n\r\n“She said”—Cousin Stickles’ voice was little more than a whisper—“she\r\nsaid—_‘Oh, darn!’_”\r\n\r\n“To think I should have lived to hear my daughter swearing!” sobbed\r\nMrs. Frederick.\r\n\r\n“It—it was only imitation swearing,” faltered Cousin Stickles, desirous\r\nof smoothing things over now that the worst was out. But she had\r\n_never_ told about the bannister.\r\n\r\n“It will be only a step from that to real swearing,” said Uncle James\r\nsternly.\r\n\r\n“The worst of this”—Mrs. Frederick hunted for a dry spot on her\r\nhandkerchief—“is that every one will know now that she is deranged. We\r\ncan’t keep it a secret any longer. Oh, I cannot bear it!”\r\n\r\n“You should have been stricter with her when she was young,” said Uncle\r\nBenjamin.\r\n\r\n“I don’t see how I could have been,” said Mrs. Frederick—truthfully\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n“The worst feature of the case is that that Snaith scoundrel is always\r\nhanging around Roaring Abel’s,” said Uncle James. “I shall be thankful\r\nif nothing worse comes of this mad freak than a few weeks at Roaring\r\nAbel’s. Cissy Gay _can’t_ live much longer.”\r\n\r\n“And she didn’t even take her flannel petticoat!” lamented Cousin\r\nStickles.\r\n\r\n“I’ll see Ambrose Marsh again about this,” said Uncle Benjamin—meaning\r\nValancy, not the flannel petticoat.\r\n\r\n“I’ll see Lawyer Ferguson,” said Uncle James.\r\n\r\n“Meanwhile,” added Uncle Benjamin, “let us be calm.”"

      "content": "Valancy had walked out to Roaring Abel’s house on the Mistawis road\r\nunder a sky of purple and amber, with a queer exhilaration and\r\nexpectancy in her heart. Back there, behind her, her mother and Cousin\r\nStickles were crying—over themselves, not over her. But here the wind\r\nwas in her face, soft, dew-wet, cool, blowing along the grassy roads.\r\nOh, she loved the wind! The robins were whistling sleepily in the firs\r\nalong the way and the moist air was fragrant with the tang of balsam.\r\nBig cars went purring past in the violet dusk—the stream of summer\r\ntourists to Muskoka had already begun—but Valancy did not envy any of\r\ntheir occupants. Muskoka cottages might be charming, but beyond, in the\r\nsunset skies, among the spires of the firs, her Blue Castle towered.\r\nShe brushed the old years and habits and inhibitions away from her like\r\ndead leaves. She would _not_ be littered with them.\r\n\r\nRoaring Abel’s rambling, tumble-down old house was situated about three\r\nmiles from the village, on the very edge of “up back,” as the sparsely\r\nsettled, hilly, wooded country around Mistawis was called vernacularly.\r\nIt did not, it must be confessed, look much like a Blue Castle.\r\n\r\nIt had once been a snug place enough in the days when Abel Gay had been\r\nyoung and prosperous, and the punning, arched sign over the gate—“A.\r\nGay, Carpenter,” had been fine and freshly painted. Now it was a faded,\r\ndreary old place, with a leprous, patched roof and shutters hanging\r\naskew. Abel never seemed to do any carpenter jobs about his own house.\r\nIt had a listless air, as if tired of life. There was a dwindling grove\r\nof ragged, crone-like old spruces behind it. The garden, which Cissy\r\nused to keep neat and pretty, had run wild. On two sides of the house\r\nwere fields full of nothing but mulleins. Behind the house was a long\r\nstretch of useless barrens, full of scrub pines and spruces, with here\r\nand there a blossoming bit of wild cherry, running back to a belt of\r\ntimber on the shores of Lake Mistawis, two miles away. A rough, rocky,\r\nboulder-strewn lane ran through it to the woods—a lane white with\r\npestiferous, beautiful daisies.\r\n\r\nRoaring Abel met Valancy at the door.\r\n\r\n“So you’ve come,” he said incredulously. “I never s’posed that ruck of\r\nStirlings would let you.”\r\n\r\nValancy showed all her pointed teeth in a grin.\r\n\r\n“They couldn’t stop me.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t think you’d so much spunk,” said Roaring Abel admiringly.\r\n“And look at the nice ankles of her,” he added, as he stepped aside to\r\nlet her in.\r\n\r\nIf Cousin Stickles had heard this she would have been certain that\r\nValancy’s doom, earthly and unearthly, was sealed. But Abel’s\r\nsuperannuated gallantry did not worry Valancy. Besides, this was the\r\nfirst compliment she had ever received in her life and she found\r\nherself liking it. She sometimes suspected she had nice ankles, but\r\nnobody had ever mentioned it before. In the Stirling clan ankles were\r\namong the unmentionables.\r\n\r\nRoaring Abel took her into the kitchen, where Cissy Gay was lying on\r\nthe sofa, breathing quickly, with little scarlet spots on her hollow\r\ncheeks. Valancy had not seen Cecilia Gay for years. Then she had been\r\nsuch a pretty creature, a slight, blossom-like girl, with soft, golden\r\nhair, clear-cut, almost waxen features, and large, beautiful blue eyes.\r\nShe was shocked at the change in her. Could this be sweet Cissy—this\r\npitiful little thing that looked like a tired, broken flower? She had\r\nwept all the beauty out of her eyes; they looked too big—enormous—in\r\nher wasted face. The last time Valancy had seen Cecilia Gay those\r\nfaded, piteous eyes had been limpid, shadowy blue pools aglow with\r\nmirth. The contrast was so terrible that Valancy’s own eyes filled with\r\ntears. She knelt down by Cissy and put her arms about her.\r\n\r\n“Cissy dear, I’ve come to look after you. I’ll stay with you\r\ntill—till—as long as you want me.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” Cissy put her thin arms about Valancy’s neck. “Oh—_will_ you?\r\nIt’s been so—lonely. I can wait on myself—but it’s been so _lonely_.\r\nIt—would just be like—heaven—to have some one here—like you. You were\r\nalways—so sweet to me—long ago.”\r\n\r\nValancy held Cissy close. She was suddenly happy. Here was some one who\r\nneeded her—some one she could help. She was no longer a superfluity.\r\nOld things had passed away; everything had become new.\r\n\r\n“Most things are predestinated, but some are just darn sheer luck,”\r\nsaid Roaring Abel, complacently smoking his pipe in the corner."

      "content": "When Valancy had lived for a week at Roaring Abel’s she felt as if\r\nyears had separated her from her old life and all the people she had\r\nknown in it. They were beginning to seem remote—dream-like—far-away—and\r\nas the days went on they seemed still more so, until they ceased to\r\nmatter altogether.\r\n\r\nShe was happy. Nobody ever bothered her with conundrums or insisted on\r\ngiving her Purple Pills. Nobody called her Doss or worried her about\r\ncatching cold. There were no quilts to piece, no abominable\r\nrubber-plant to water, no ice-cold maternal tantrums to endure. She\r\ncould be alone whenever she liked, go to bed when she liked, sneeze\r\nwhen she liked. In the long, wondrous, northern twilights, when Cissy\r\nwas asleep and Roaring Abel away, she could sit for hours on the shaky\r\nback verandah steps, looking out over the barrens to the hills beyond,\r\ncovered with their fine, purple bloom, listening to the friendly wind\r\nsinging wild, sweet melodies in the little spruces, and drinking in the\r\naroma of the sunned grasses, until darkness flowed over the landscape\r\nlike a cool, welcome wave.\r\n\r\nSometimes of an afternoon, when Cissy was strong enough, the two girls\r\nwent into the barrens and looked at the wood-flowers. But they did not\r\npick any. Valancy had read to Cissy the gospel thereof according to\r\nJohn Foster: “It is a pity to gather wood-flowers. They lose half their\r\nwitchery away from the green and the flicker. The way to enjoy\r\nwood-flowers is to track them down to their remote haunts—gloat over\r\nthem—and then leave them with backward glances, taking with us only the\r\nbeguiling memory of their grace and fragrance.”\r\n\r\nValancy was in the midst of realities after a lifetime of unrealities.\r\nAnd busy—very busy. The house had to be cleaned. Not for nothing had\r\nValancy been brought up in the Stirling habits of neatness and\r\ncleanliness. If she found satisfaction in cleaning dirty rooms she got\r\nher fill of it there. Roaring Abel thought she was foolish to bother\r\ndoing so much more than she was asked to do, but he did not interfere\r\nwith her. He was very well satisfied with his bargain. Valancy was a\r\ngood cook. Abel said she got a flavour into things. The only fault he\r\nfound with her was that she did not sing at her work.\r\n\r\n“Folks should always sing at their work,” he insisted. “Sounds\r\ncheerful-like.”\r\n\r\n“Not always,” retorted Valancy. “Fancy a butcher singing at his work.\r\nOr an undertaker.”\r\n\r\nAbel burst into his great broad laugh.\r\n\r\n“There’s no getting the better of you. You’ve got an answer every time.\r\nI should think the Stirlings would be glad to be rid of you. _They_\r\ndon’t like being sassed back.”\r\n\r\nDuring the day Abel was generally away from home—if not working, then\r\nshooting or fishing with Barney Snaith. He generally came home at\r\nnights—always very late and often very drunk. The first night they\r\nheard him come howling into the yard, Cissy had told Valancy not to be\r\nafraid.\r\n\r\n“Father never does anything—he just makes a noise.”\r\n\r\nValancy, lying on the sofa in Cissy’s room, where she had elected to\r\nsleep, lest Cissy should need attention in the night—Cissy would never\r\nhave called her—was not at all afraid, and said so. By the time Abel\r\nhad got his horses put away, the roaring stage had passed and he was in\r\nhis room at the end of the hall crying and praying. Valancy could still\r\nhear his dismal moans when she went calmly to sleep. For the most part,\r\nAbel was a good-natured creature, but occasionally he had a temper.\r\nOnce Valancy asked him coolly:\r\n\r\n“What is the use of getting in a rage?”\r\n\r\n“It’s such a d——d relief,” said Abel.\r\n\r\nThey both burst out laughing together.\r\n\r\n“You’re a great little sport,” said Abel admiringly. “Don’t mind my bad\r\nFrench. I don’t mean a thing by it. Jest habit. Say, I like a woman\r\nthat ain’t afraid to speak up to me. Sis there was always too meek—too\r\nmeek. That’s why she got adrift. I like you.”\r\n\r\n“All the same,” said Valancy determinedly, “there is no use in sending\r\nthings to hell as you’re always doing. And I’m _not_ going to have you\r\ntracking mud all over a floor I’ve just scrubbed. You _must_ use the\r\nscraper whether you consign it to perdition or not.”\r\n\r\nCissy loved the cleanness and neatness. She had kept it so, too, until\r\nher strength failed. She was very pitifully happy because she had\r\nValancy with her. It had been so terrible—the long, lonely days and\r\nnights with no companionship save those dreadful old women who came to\r\nwork. Cissy had hated and feared them. She clung to Valancy like a\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt that Cissy was dying. Yet at no time did she seem\r\nalarmingly ill. She did not even cough a great deal. Most days she was\r\nable to get up and dress—sometimes even to work about in the garden or\r\nthe barrens for an hour or two. For a few weeks after Valancy’s coming\r\nshe seemed so much better that Valancy began to hope she might get\r\nwell. But Cissy shook her head.\r\n\r\n“No, I can’t get well. My lungs are almost gone. And I—don’t want to.\r\nI’m so tired, Valancy. Only dying can rest me. But it’s lovely to have\r\nyou here—you’ll never know how much it means to me. But Valancy—you\r\nwork too hard. You don’t need to—Father only wants his meals cooked. I\r\ndon’t think you are strong yourself. You turn so pale sometimes. And\r\nthose drops you take. _Are_ you well, dear?”\r\n\r\n“I’m all right,” said Valancy lightly. She would not have Cissy\r\nworried. “And I’m not working hard. I’m glad to have some work to\r\ndo—something that really wants to be done.”\r\n\r\n“Then”—Cissy slipped her hand wistfully into Valancy’s—“don’t let’s\r\ntalk any more about my being sick. Let’s just forget it. Let’s pretend\r\nI’m a little girl again—and you have come here to play with me. I used\r\nto wish that long ago—wish that you could come. I knew you couldn’t, of\r\ncourse. But how I did wish it! You always seemed so different from the\r\nother girls—so kind and sweet—and as if you had something in yourself\r\nnobody knew about—some dear, pretty secret. _Had_ you, Valancy?”\r\n\r\n“I had my Blue Castle,” said Valancy, laughing a little. She was\r\npleased that Cissy had thought of her like this. She had never\r\nsuspected that anybody liked or admired or wondered about her. She told\r\nCissy all about her Blue Castle. She had never told any one about it\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n“Every one has a Blue Castle, I think,” said Cissy softly. “Only every\r\none has a different name for it. _I_ had mine—once.”\r\n\r\nShe put her two thin little hands over her face. She did not tell\r\nValancy—then—who had destroyed her Blue Castle. But Valancy knew that,\r\nwhoever it was, it was not Barney Snaith."

      "content": "Valancy was acquainted with Barney by now—well acquainted, it seemed,\r\nthough she had spoken to him only a few times. But then she had felt\r\njust as well acquainted with him the first time they had met. She had\r\nbeen in the garden at twilight, hunting for a few stalks of white\r\nnarcissus for Cissy’s room when she heard that terrible old Grey\r\nSlosson coming down through the woods from Mistawis—one could hear it\r\nmiles away. Valancy did not look up as it drew near, thumping over the\r\nrocks in that crazy lane. She had never looked up, though Barney had\r\ngone racketting past every evening since she had been at Roaring\r\nAbel’s. This time he did not racket past. The old Grey Slosson stopped\r\nwith even more terrible noises than it made going. Valancy was\r\nconscious that Barney had sprung from it and was leaning over the\r\nramshackle gate. She suddenly straightened up and looked into his face.\r\nTheir eyes met—Valancy was suddenly conscious of a delicious weakness.\r\nWas one of her heart attacks coming on?—But this was a new symptom.\r\n\r\nHis eyes, which she had always thought brown, now seen close, were deep\r\nviolet—translucent and intense. Neither of his eyebrows looked like the\r\nother. He was thin—too thin—she wished she could feed him up a bit—she\r\nwished she could sew the buttons on his coat—and make him cut his\r\nhair—and shave every day. There was _something_ in his face—one hardly\r\nknew what it was. Tiredness? Sadness? Disillusionment? He had dimples\r\nin his thin cheeks when he smiled. All these thoughts flashed through\r\nValancy’s mind in that one moment while his eyes looked into hers.\r\n\r\n“Good-evening, Miss Stirling.”\r\n\r\nNothing could be more commonplace and conventional. Any one might have\r\nsaid it. But Barney Snaith had a way of saying things that gave them\r\npoignancy. When he said good-evening you felt that it _was_ a good\r\nevening and that it was partly his doing that it was. Also, you felt\r\nthat some of the credit was yours. Valancy felt all this vaguely, but\r\nshe couldn’t imagine why she was trembling from head to foot—it _must_\r\nbe her heart. If only he didn’t notice it!\r\n\r\n“I’m going over to the Port,” Barney was saying. “Can I acquire merit\r\nby getting or doing anything there for you or Cissy?”\r\n\r\n“Will you get some salt codfish for us?” said Valancy. It was the only\r\nthing she could think of. Roaring Abel had expressed a desire that day\r\nfor a dinner of boiled salt codfish. When her knights came riding to\r\nthe Blue Castle, Valancy had sent them on many a quest, but she had\r\nnever asked any of them to get her salt codfish.\r\n\r\n“Certainly. You’re sure there’s nothing else? Lots of room in Lady Jane\r\nGrey Slosson. And she always gets back _some_ time, does Lady Jane.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think there’s anything more,” said Valancy. She knew he would\r\nbring oranges for Cissy anyhow—he always did.\r\n\r\nBarney did not turn away at once. He was silent for a little. Then he\r\nsaid, slowly and whimsically:\r\n\r\n“Miss Stirling, you’re a brick! You’re a whole cartload of bricks. To\r\ncome here and look after Cissy—under the circumstances.”\r\n\r\n“There’s nothing so bricky about that,” said Valancy. “I’d nothing else\r\nto do. And—I like it here. I don’t feel as if I’d done anything\r\nspecially meritorious. Mr. Gay is paying me fair wages. I never earned\r\nany money before—and I like it.” It seemed so easy to talk to Barney\r\nSnaith, someway—this terrible Barney Snaith of the lurid tales and\r\nmysterious past—as easy and natural as if talking to herself.\r\n\r\n“All the money in the world couldn’t buy what you’re doing for Cissy\r\nGay,” said Barney. “It’s splendid and fine of you. And if there’s\r\nanything I can do to help you in any way, you have only to let me know.\r\nIf Roaring Abel ever tries to annoy you——”\r\n\r\n“He doesn’t. He’s lovely to me. I like Roaring Abel,” said Valancy\r\nfrankly.\r\n\r\n“So do I. But there’s one stage of his drunkenness—perhaps you haven’t\r\nencountered it yet—when he sings ribald songs——”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes. He came home last night like that. Cissy and I just went to\r\nour room and shut ourselves in where we couldn’t hear him. He\r\napologised this morning. I’m not afraid of any of Roaring Abel’s\r\nstages.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m sure he’ll be decent to you, apart from his inebriated\r\nyowls,” said Barney. “And I’ve told him he’s got to stop damning things\r\nwhen you’re around.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” asked Valancy slily, with one of her odd, slanted glances and a\r\nsudden flake of pink on each cheek, born of the thought that Barney\r\nSnaith had actually done so much for _her_. “I often feel like damning\r\nthings myself.”\r\n\r\nFor a moment Barney stared. Was this elfin girl the little, old-maidish\r\ncreature who had stood there two minutes ago? Surely there was magic\r\nand devilry going on in that shabby, weedy old garden.\r\n\r\nThen he laughed.\r\n\r\n“It will be a relief to have some one to do it for you, then. So you\r\ndon’t want anything but salt codfish?”\r\n\r\n“Not tonight. But I dare say I’ll have some errands for you very often\r\nwhen you go to Port Lawrence. I can’t trust Mr. Gay to remember to\r\nbring all the things I want.”\r\n\r\nBarney had gone away, then, in his Lady Jane, and Valancy stood in the\r\ngarden for a long time.\r\n\r\nSince then he had called several times, walking down through the\r\nbarrens, whistling. How that whistle of his echoed through the spruces\r\non those June twilights! Valancy caught herself listening for it every\r\nevening—rebuked herself—then let herself go. Why shouldn’t she listen\r\nfor it?\r\n\r\nHe always brought Cissy fruit and flowers. Once he brought Valancy a\r\nbox of candy—the first box of candy she had ever been given. It seemed\r\nsacrilege to eat it.\r\n\r\nShe found herself thinking of him in season and out of season. She\r\nwanted to know if he ever thought about her when she wasn’t before his\r\neyes, and, if so, what. She wanted to see that mysterious house of his\r\nback on the Mistawis island. Cissy had never seen it. Cissy, though she\r\ntalked freely of Barney and had known him for five years, really knew\r\nlittle more of him than Valancy herself.\r\n\r\n“But he isn’t bad,” said Cissy. “Nobody need ever tell me he is. He\r\n_can’t_ have done a thing to be ashamed of.”\r\n\r\n“Then why does he live as he does?” asked Valancy—to hear somebody\r\ndefend him.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. He’s a mystery. And of course there’s something behind\r\nit, but I _know_ it isn’t disgrace. Barney Snaith simply couldn’t do\r\nanything disgraceful, Valancy.”\r\n\r\nValancy was not so sure. Barney must have done _something_—sometime. He\r\nwas a man of education and intelligence. She had soon discovered that,\r\nin listening to his conversations and wrangles with Roaring Abel—who\r\nwas surprisingly well read and could discuss any subject under the sun\r\nwhen sober. Such a man wouldn’t bury himself for five years in Muskoka\r\nand live and look like a tramp if there were not too good—or bad—a\r\nreason for it. But it didn’t matter. All that mattered was that she was\r\nsure now that he had never been Cissy Gay’s lover. There was nothing\r\nlike _that_ between them. Though he was very fond of Cissy and she of\r\nhim, as any one could see. But it was a fondness that didn’t worry\r\nValancy.\r\n\r\n“You don’t know what Barney has been to me, these past two years,”\r\nCissy had said simply. “_Everything_ would have been unbearable without\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“Cissy Gay is the sweetest girl I ever knew—and there’s a man somewhere\r\nI’d like to shoot if I could find him,” Barney had said savagely.\r\n\r\nBarney was an interesting talker, with a knack of telling a great deal\r\nabout his adventures and nothing at all about himself. There was one\r\nglorious rainy day when Barney and Abel swapped yarns all the afternoon\r\nwhile Valancy mended tablecloths and listened. Barney told weird tales\r\nof his adventures with “shacks” on trains while hoboing it across the\r\ncontinent. Valancy thought she ought to think his stealing rides quite\r\ndreadful, but didn’t. The story of his working his way to England on a\r\ncattle-ship sounded more legitimate. And his yarns of the Yukon\r\nenthralled her—especially the one of the night he was lost on the\r\ndivide between Gold Run and Sulphur Valley. He had spent two years out\r\nthere. Where in all this was there room for the penitentiary and the\r\nother things?\r\n\r\nIf he were telling the truth. But Valancy knew he was.\r\n\r\n“Found no gold,” he said. “Came away poorer than when I went. But such\r\na place to live! Those silences at the back of the north wind _got_ me.\r\nI’ve never belonged to myself since.”\r\n\r\nYet he was not a great talker. He told a great deal in a few\r\nwell-chosen words—how well-chosen Valancy did not realise. And he had a\r\nknack of saying things without opening his mouth at all.\r\n\r\n“I like a man whose eyes say more than his lips,” thought Valancy.\r\n\r\nBut then she liked everything about him—his tawny hair—his whimsical\r\nsmiles—the little glints of fun in his eyes—his loyal affection for\r\nthat unspeakable Lady Jane—his habit of sitting with his hands in his\r\npockets, his chin sunk on his breast, looking up from under his\r\nmismated eyebrows. She liked his nice voice which sounded as if it\r\nmight become caressing or wooing with very little provocation. She was\r\nat times almost afraid to let herself think these thoughts. They were\r\nso vivid that she felt as if the others _must_ know what she was\r\nthinking.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been watching a woodpecker all day,” he said one evening on the\r\nshaky old back verandah. His account of the woodpecker’s doings was\r\nsatisfying. He had often some gay or cunning little anecdote of the\r\nwood folk to tell them. And sometimes he and Roaring Abel smoked\r\nfiercely the whole evening and never said a word, while Cissy lay in\r\nthe hammock swung between the verandah posts and Valancy sat idly on\r\nthe steps, her hands clasped over her knees, and wondered dreamily if\r\nshe were really Valancy Stirling and if it were only three weeks since\r\nshe had left the ugly old house on Elm Street.\r\n\r\nThe barrens lay before her in a white moon splendour, where dozens of\r\nlittle rabbits frisked. Barney, when he liked, could sit down on the\r\nedge of the barrens and lure those rabbits right to him by some\r\nmysterious sorcery he possessed. Valancy had once seen a squirrel leap\r\nfrom a scrub pine to his shoulder and sit there chattering to him. It\r\nreminded her of John Foster.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the delights of Valancy’s new life that she could read\r\nJohn Foster’s books as often and as long as she liked. She could read\r\nthem in bed if she wanted to. She read them all to Cissy, who loved\r\nthem. She also tried to read them to Abel and Barney, who did not love\r\nthem. Abel was bored and Barney politely refused to listen at all.\r\n\r\n“Piffle,” said Barney."

      "content": "Of course, the Stirlings had not left the poor maniac alone all this\r\ntime or refrained from heroic efforts to rescue her perishing soul and\r\nreputation. Uncle James, whose lawyer had helped him as little as his\r\ndoctor, came one day and, finding Valancy alone in the kitchen, as he\r\nsupposed, gave her a terrible talking-to—told her she was breaking her\r\nmother’s heart and disgracing her family.\r\n\r\n“But _why_?” said Valancy, not ceasing to scour her porridge pot\r\ndecently. “I’m doing honest work for honest pay. What is there in that\r\nthat is disgraceful?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t quibble, Valancy,” said Uncle James solemnly. “This is no fit\r\nplace for you to be, and you know it. Why, I’m told that that jail-bird,\r\nSnaith, is hanging around here every evening.”\r\n\r\n“Not _every_ evening,” said Valancy reflectively. “No, not quite every\r\nevening.”\r\n\r\n“It’s—it’s insufferable!” said Uncle James violently. “Valancy, you\r\n_must_ come home. We won’t judge you harshly. I assure you we won’t.\r\nWe will overlook all this.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said Valancy.\r\n\r\n“Have you no sense of shame?” demanded Uncle James.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes. But the things _I_ am ashamed of are not the things _you_ are\r\nashamed of.” Valancy proceeded to rinse her dishcloth meticulously.\r\n\r\nStill was Uncle James patient. He gripped the sides of his chair and\r\nground his teeth.\r\n\r\n“We know your mind isn’t just right. We’ll make allowances. But you\r\n_must_ come home. You shall not stay here with that drunken,\r\nblasphemous old scoundrel——”\r\n\r\n“Were you by any chance referring to _me_, _Mister_ Stirling?” demanded\r\nRoaring Abel, suddenly appearing in the doorway of the back verandah\r\nwhere he had been smoking a peaceful pipe and listening to “old Jim\r\nStirling’s” tirade with huge enjoyment. His red beard fairly bristled\r\nwith indignation and his huge eyebrows quivered. But cowardice was not\r\namong James Stirling’s shortcomings.\r\n\r\n“I was. And, furthermore, I want to tell you that you have acted an\r\niniquitous part in luring this weak and unfortunate girl away from her\r\nhome and friends, and I will have you punished yet for it——”\r\n\r\nJames Stirling got no further. Roaring Abel crossed the kitchen at a\r\nbound, caught him by his collar and his trousers, and hurled him\r\nthrough the doorway and over the garden paling with as little apparent\r\neffort as he might have employed in whisking a troublesome kitten out\r\nof the way.\r\n\r\n“The next time you come back here,” he bellowed, “I’ll throw you\r\nthrough the window—and all the better if the window is shut! Coming\r\nhere, thinking yourself God to put the world to rights!”\r\n\r\nValancy candidly and unashamedly owned to herself that she had seen few\r\nmore satisfying sights than Uncle James’ coat-tails flying out into the\r\nasparagus bed. She had once been afraid of this man’s judgment. Now she\r\nsaw clearly that he was nothing but a rather stupid little village\r\ntin-god.\r\n\r\nRoaring Abel turned with his great broad laugh.\r\n\r\n“He’ll think of that for years when he wakes up in the night. The\r\nAlmighty made a mistake in making so many Stirlings. But since they are\r\nmade, we’ve got to reckon with them. Too many to kill out. But if they\r\ncome here bothering you I’ll shoo ’em off before a cat could lick its\r\near.”\r\n\r\nThe next time they sent Dr. Stalling. Surely Roaring Abel would not\r\nthrow him into asparagus beds. Dr. Stalling was not so sure of this and\r\nhad no great liking for the task. He did not believe Valancy Stirling\r\nwas out of her mind. She had always been queer. He, Dr. Stalling, had\r\nnever been able to understand her. Therefore, beyond doubt, she was\r\nqueer. She was only just a little queerer than usual now. And Dr.\r\nStalling had his own reasons for disliking Roaring Abel. When Dr.\r\nStalling had first come to Deerwood he had had a liking for long hikes\r\naround Mistawis and Muskoka. On one of these occasions he had got lost\r\nand after much wandering had fallen in with Roaring Abel with his gun\r\nover his shoulder.\r\n\r\nDr. Stalling had contrived to ask his question in about the most\r\nidiotic manner possible. He said, “Can you tell me where I’m going?”\r\n\r\n“How the devil should I know where you’re going, gosling?” retorted\r\nAbel contemptuously.\r\n\r\nDr. Stalling was so enraged that he could not speak for a moment or two\r\nand in that moment Abel had disappeared in the woods. Dr. Stalling had\r\neventually found his way home, but he had never hankered to encounter\r\nAbel Gay again.\r\n\r\nNevertheless he came now to do his duty. Valancy greeted him with a\r\nsinking heart. She had to own to herself that she was terribly afraid\r\nof Dr. Stalling still. She had a miserable conviction that if he shook\r\nhis long, bony finger at her and told her to go home, she dared not\r\ndisobey.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Gay,” said Dr. Stalling politely and condescendingly, “may I see\r\nMiss Stirling alone for a few minutes?”\r\n\r\nRoaring Abel was a little drunk—just drunk enough to be excessively\r\npolite and very cunning. He had been on the point of going away when\r\nDr. Stalling arrived, but now he sat down in a corner of the parlour\r\nand folded his arms.\r\n\r\n“No, no, mister,” he said solemnly. “That wouldn’t do—wouldn’t do at\r\nall. I’ve got the reputation of my household to keep up. I’ve got to\r\nchaperone this young lady. Can’t have any sparkin’ going on here behind\r\nmy back.”\r\n\r\nOutraged Dr. Stalling looked so terrible that Valancy wondered how Abel\r\ncould endure his aspect. But Abel was not worried at all.\r\n\r\n“D’ye know anything about it, anyway?” he asked genially.\r\n\r\n“About _what_?”\r\n\r\n“Sparking,” said Abel coolly.\r\n\r\nPoor Dr. Stalling, who had never married because he believed in a\r\ncelibate clergy, would not notice this ribald remark. He turned his\r\nback on Abel and addressed himself to Valancy.\r\n\r\n“Miss Stirling, I am here in response to your mother’s wishes. She\r\nbegged me to come. I am charged with some messages from her. Will\r\nyou”—he wagged his forefinger—“will you hear them?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Valancy faintly, eyeing the forefinger. It had a hypnotic\r\neffect on her.\r\n\r\n“The first is this. If you will leave this—this——”\r\n\r\n“House,” interjected Roaring Abel. “H-o-u-s-e. Troubled with an\r\nimpediment in your speech, ain’t you, Mister?”\r\n\r\n“—this _place_ and return to your home, Mr. James Stirling will himself\r\npay for a good nurse to come here and wait on Miss Gay.”\r\n\r\nBack of her terror Valancy smiled in secret. Uncle James must indeed\r\nregard the matter as desperate when he would loosen his purse-strings\r\nlike that. At any rate, her clan no longer despised her or ignored her.\r\nShe had become important to them.\r\n\r\n“That’s _my_ business, Mister,” said Abel. “Miss Stirling can go if she\r\npleases, or stay if she pleases. I made a fair bargain with her, and\r\nshe’s free to conclude it when she likes. She gives me meals that stick\r\nto my ribs. She don’t forget to put salt in the porridge. She never\r\nslams doors, and when she has nothing to say she don’t talk. That’s\r\nuncanny in a woman, you know, Mister. I’m satisfied. If she isn’t,\r\nshe’s free to go. But no woman comes here in Jim Stirling’s pay. If any\r\none does”—Abel’s voice was uncannily bland and polite—“I’ll spatter the\r\nroad with her brains. Tell him that with A. Gay’s compliments.”\r\n\r\n“Dr. Stalling, a nurse is not what Cissy needs,” said Valancy\r\nearnestly. “She isn’t so ill as that, yet. What she wants is\r\ncompanionship—somebody she knows and likes just to live with her. You\r\ncan understand that, I’m sure.”\r\n\r\n“I understand that your motive is quite—ahem—commendable.” Dr. Stalling\r\nfelt that he was very broad-minded indeed—especially as in his secret\r\nsoul he did not believe Valancy’s motive _was_ commendable. He hadn’t\r\nthe least idea what she was up to, but he was sure her motive was not\r\ncommendable. When he could not understand a thing he straightway\r\ncondemned it. Simplicity itself! “But your first duty is to your\r\nmother. _She_ needs you. She implores you to come home—she will forgive\r\neverything if you will only come home.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a pretty little thought,” remarked Abel meditatively, as he\r\nground some tobacco up in his hand.\r\n\r\nDr. Stalling ignored him.\r\n\r\n“She entreats, but I, Miss Stirling,”—Dr. Stalling remembered that he\r\nwas an ambassador of Jehovah—“_I command._ As your pastor and spiritual\r\nguide, I command you to come home with me—this very day. Get your hat\r\nand coat and come _now_.”\r\n\r\nDr. Stalling shook his finger at Valancy. Before that pitiless finger\r\nshe drooped and wilted visibly.\r\n\r\n“She’s giving in,” thought Roaring Abel. “She’ll go with him. Beats\r\nall, the power these preacher fellows have over women.”\r\n\r\nValancy _was_ on the point of obeying Dr. Stalling. She must go home\r\nwith him—and give up. She would lapse back to Doss Stirling again and\r\nfor her few remaining days or weeks be the cowed, futile creature she\r\nhad always been. It was her fate—typified by that relentless, uplifted\r\nforefinger. She could no more escape from it than Roaring Abel from his\r\npredestination. She eyed it as the fascinated bird eyes the snake.\r\nAnother moment—\r\n\r\n“_Fear is the original sin_,” suddenly said a still, small voice away\r\nback—back—back of Valancy’s consciousness. “_Almost all the evil in the\r\nworld has its origin in the fact that some one is afraid of\r\nsomething._”\r\n\r\nValancy stood up. She was still in the clutches of fear, but her soul\r\nwas her own again. She would not be false to that inner voice.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Stalling,” she said slowly, “I do not at present owe _any_ duty to\r\nmy mother. She is quite well; she has all the assistance and\r\ncompanionship she requires; she does not need me at all. I _am_ needed\r\nhere. I am going to stay here.”\r\n\r\n“There’s spunk for you,” said Roaring Abel admiringly.\r\n\r\nDr. Stalling dropped his forefinger. One could not keep on shaking a\r\nfinger forever.\r\n\r\n“Miss Stirling, is there _nothing_ that can influence you? Do you\r\nremember your childhood days——”\r\n\r\n“Perfectly. And hate them.”\r\n\r\n“Do you realise what people will say? What they _are_ saying?”\r\n\r\n“I can imagine it,” said Valancy, with a shrug of her shoulders. She\r\nwas suddenly free of fear again. “I haven’t listened to the gossip of\r\nDeerwood teaparties and sewing circles twenty years for nothing. But,\r\nDr. Stalling, it doesn’t matter in the least to me what they say—not in\r\nthe least.”\r\n\r\nDr. Stalling went away then. A girl who cared nothing for public\r\nopinion! Over whom sacred family ties had no restraining influence! Who\r\nhated her childhood memories!\r\n\r\nThen Cousin Georgiana came—on her own initiative, for nobody would have\r\nthought it worth while to send her. She found Valancy alone, weeding\r\nthe little vegetable garden she had planted, and she made all the\r\nplatitudinous pleas she could think of. Valancy heard her patiently.\r\nCousin Georgiana wasn’t such a bad old soul. Then she said:\r\n\r\n“And now that you have got all that out of your system, Cousin\r\nGeorgiana, can you tell me how to make creamed codfish so that it will\r\nnot be as thick as porridge and as salt as the Dead Sea?”\r\n\r\n* * * * * * *\r\n\r\n“We’ll just have to _wait_,” said Uncle Benjamin. “After all, Cissy Gay\r\ncan’t live long. Dr. Marsh tells me she may drop off any day.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Frederick wept. It would really have been so much easier to bear\r\nif Valancy had died. She could have worn mourning then."

      "content": "When Abel Gay paid Valancy her first month’s wages—which he did\r\npromptly, in bills reeking with the odour of tobacco and\r\nwhiskey—Valancy went into Deerwood and spent every cent of it. She got\r\na pretty green crêpe dress with a girdle of crimson beads, at a bargain\r\nsale, a pair of silk stockings, to match, and a little crinkled green\r\nhat with a crimson rose in it. She even bought a foolish little\r\nberibboned and belaced nightgown.\r\n\r\nShe passed the house on Elm Street twice—Valancy never even thought\r\nabout it as “home”—but saw no one. No doubt her mother was sitting in\r\nthe room this lovely June evening playing solitaire—and cheating.\r\nValancy knew that Mrs. Frederick always cheated. She never lost a game.\r\nMost of the people Valancy met looked at her seriously and passed her\r\nwith a cool nod. Nobody stopped to speak to her.\r\n\r\nValancy put on her green dress when she got home. Then she took it off\r\nagain. She felt so miserably undressed in its low neck and short\r\nsleeves. And that low, crimson girdle around the hips seemed positively\r\nindecent. She hung it up in the closet, feeling flatly that she had\r\nwasted her money. She would never have the courage to wear that dress.\r\nJohn Foster’s arraignment of fear had no power to stiffen her against\r\nthis. In this one thing habit and custom were still all-powerful. Yet\r\nshe sighed as she went down to meet Barney Snaith in her old\r\nsnuff-brown silk. That green thing had been very becoming—she had seen\r\nso much in her one ashamed glance. Above it her eyes had looked like\r\nodd brown jewels and the girdle had given her flat figure an entirely\r\ndifferent appearance. She wished she could have left it on. But there\r\nwere some things John Foster did not know.\r\n\r\nEvery Sunday evening Valancy went to the little Free Methodist church\r\nin a valley on the edge of “up back”—a spireless little grey building\r\namong the pines, with a few sunken graves and mossy gravestones in the\r\nsmall, paling-encircled, grass-grown square beside it. She liked the\r\nminister who preached there. He was so simple and sincere. An old man,\r\nwho lived in Port Lawrence and came out by the lake in a little\r\ndisappearing propeller boat to give a free service to the people of the\r\nsmall, stony farms back of the hills, who would otherwise never have\r\nheard any gospel message. She liked the simple service and the fervent\r\nsinging. She liked to sit by the open window and look out into the pine\r\nwoods. The congregation was always small. The Free Methodists were few\r\nin number, poor and generally illiterate. But Valancy loved those\r\nSunday evenings. For the first time in her life she liked going to\r\nchurch. The rumour reached Deerwood that she had “turned Free\r\nMethodist” and sent Mrs. Frederick to bed for a day. But Valancy had\r\nnot turned anything. She went to the church because she liked it and\r\nbecause in some inexplicable way it did her good. Old Mr. Towers\r\nbelieved exactly what he preached and somehow it made a tremendous\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nOddly enough, Roaring Abel disapproved of her going to the hill church\r\nas strongly as Mrs. Frederick herself could have done. He had “no use\r\nfor Free Methodists. He was a Presbyterian.” But Valancy went in spite\r\nof him.\r\n\r\n“We’ll hear something worse than _that_ about her soon,” Uncle Benjamin\r\npredicted gloomily.\r\n\r\nThey did.\r\n\r\nValancy could not quite explain, even to herself, just why she wanted\r\nto go to that party. It was a dance “up back” at Chidley Corners; and\r\ndances at Chidley Corners were not, as a rule, the sort of assemblies\r\nwhere well-brought-up young ladies were found. Valancy knew it was\r\ncoming off, for Roaring Abel had been engaged as one of the fiddlers.\r\n\r\nBut the idea of going had never occurred to her until Roaring Abel\r\nhimself broached it at supper.\r\n\r\n“You come with me to the dance,” he ordered. “It’ll do you good—put\r\nsome colour in your face. You look peaked—you want something to liven\r\nyou up.”\r\n\r\nValancy found herself suddenly wanting to go. She knew nothing at all\r\nof what dances at Chidley Corners were apt to be like. Her idea of\r\ndances had been fashioned on the correct affairs that went by that name\r\nin Deerwood and Port Lawrence. Of course she knew the Corners’ dance\r\nwouldn’t be just like them. Much more informal, of course. But so much\r\nthe more interesting. Why shouldn’t she go? Cissy was in a week of\r\napparent health and improvement. She wouldn’t mind staying alone in the\r\nleast. She entreated Valancy to go if she wanted to. And Valancy _did_\r\nwant to go.\r\n\r\nShe went to her room to dress. A rage against the snuff-brown silk\r\nseized her. Wear _that_ to a party! Never. She pulled her green crêpe\r\nfrom its hanger and put it on feverishly. It was nonsense to feel\r\nso—so—naked—just because her neck and arms were bare. That was just her\r\nold maidishness. She would not be ridden by it. On went the dress—the\r\nslippers.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time she had worn a pretty dress since the organdies\r\nof her early teens. And _they_ had never made her look like this.\r\n\r\nIf she only had a necklace or something. She wouldn’t feel so bare\r\nthen. She ran down to the garden. There were clovers there—great\r\ncrimson things growing in the long grass. Valancy gathered handfuls of\r\nthem and strung them on a cord. Fastened above her neck they gave her\r\nthe comfortable sensation of a collar and were oddly becoming. Another\r\ncirclet of them went round her hair, dressed in the low puffs that\r\nbecame her. Excitement brought those faint pink stains to her face. She\r\nflung on her coat and pulled the little, twisty hat over her hair.\r\n\r\n“You look so nice and—and—different, dear,” said Cissy. “Like a green\r\nmoonbeam with a gleam of red in it, if there could be such a thing.”\r\n\r\nValancy stooped to kiss her.\r\n\r\n“I don’t feel right about leaving you alone, Cissy.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I’ll be all right. I feel better tonight than I have for a long\r\nwhile. I’ve been feeling badly to see you sticking here so closely on\r\nmy account. I hope you’ll have a nice time. I never was at a party at\r\nthe Corners, but I used to go sometimes, long ago, to dances up back.\r\nWe always had good times. And you needn’t be afraid of Father being\r\ndrunk tonight. He never drinks when he engages to play for a party.\r\nBut—there may be—liquor. What will you do if it gets rough?”\r\n\r\n“Nobody would molest me.”\r\n\r\n“Not seriously, I suppose. Father would see to that. But it _might_ be\r\nnoisy and—and unpleasant.”\r\n\r\n“I won’t mind. I’m only going as a looker-on. I don’t expect to dance.\r\nI just want to _see_ what a party up back is like. I’ve never seen\r\nanything except decorous Deerwood.”\r\n\r\nCissy smiled rather dubiously. She knew much better than Valancy what a\r\nparty “up back” might be like if there should be liquor. But again\r\nthere mightn’t be.\r\n\r\n“I hope you’ll enjoy it, dear,” she repeated.\r\n\r\nValancy enjoyed the drive there. They went early, for it was twelve\r\nmiles to Chidley Corners, and they had to go in Abel’s old, ragged\r\ntop-buggy. The road was rough and rocky, like most Muskoka roads, but\r\nfull of the austere charm of northern woods. It wound through\r\nbeautiful, purring pines that were ranks of enchantment in the June\r\nsunset, and over the curious jade-green rivers of Muskoka, fringed by\r\naspens that were always quivering with some supernal joy.\r\n\r\nRoaring Abel was excellent company, too. He knew all the stories and\r\nlegends of the wild, beautiful “up back,” and he told them to Valancy\r\nas they drove along. Valancy had several fits of inward laughter over\r\nwhat Uncle Benjamin and Aunt Wellington, _et al._, would feel and think\r\nand say if they saw her driving with Roaring Abel in that terrible\r\nbuggy to a dance at Chidley Corners.\r\n\r\nAt first the dance was quiet enough, and Valancy was amused and\r\nentertained. She even danced twice herself, with a couple of nice “up\r\nback” boys who danced beautifully and told her she did, too.\r\n\r\nAnother compliment came her way—not a very subtle one, perhaps, but\r\nValancy had had too few compliments in her life to be over-nice on that\r\npoint. She overheard two of the “up back” young men talking about her\r\nin the dark “lean-to” behind her.\r\n\r\n“Know who that girl in green is?”\r\n\r\n“Nope. Guess she’s from out front. The Port, maybe. Got a stylish look\r\nto her.”\r\n\r\n“No beaut but cute-looking, I’ll say. ’Jever see such eyes?”\r\n\r\nThe big room was decorated with pine and fir boughs, and lighted by\r\nChinese lanterns. The floor was waxed, and Roaring Abel’s fiddle,\r\npurring under his skilled touch, worked magic. The “up back” girls were\r\npretty and prettily dressed. Valancy thought it the nicest party she\r\nhad ever attended.\r\n\r\nBy eleven o’clock she had changed her mind. A new crowd had arrived—a\r\ncrowd unmistakably drunk. Whiskey began to circulate freely. Very soon\r\nalmost all the men were partly drunk. Those in the porch and outside\r\naround the door began howling “come-all-ye’s” and continued to howl\r\nthem. The room grew noisy and reeking. Quarrels started up here and\r\nthere. Bad language and obscene songs were heard. The girls, swung\r\nrudely in the dances, became dishevelled and tawdry. Valancy, alone in\r\nher corner, was feeling disgusted and repentant. Why had she ever come\r\nto such a place? Freedom and independence were all very well, but one\r\nshould not be a little fool. She might have known what it would be\r\nlike—she might have taken warning from Cissy’s guarded sentences. Her\r\nhead was aching—she was sick of the whole thing. But what could she do?\r\nShe must stay to the end. Abel could not leave till then. And that\r\nwould probably be not till three or four in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe new influx of boys had left the girls far in the minority and\r\npartners were scarce. Valancy was pestered with invitations to dance.\r\nShe refused them all shortly, and some of her refusals were not well\r\ntaken. There were muttered oaths and sullen looks. Across the room she\r\nsaw a group of the strangers talking together and glancing meaningly at\r\nher. What were they plotting?\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment that she saw Barney Snaith looking in over the\r\nheads of the crowd at the doorway. Valancy had two distinct\r\nconvictions—one was that she was quite safe now; the other was that\r\n_this_ was why she had wanted to come to the dance. It had been such an\r\nabsurd hope that she had not recognised it before, but now she knew she\r\nhad come because of the possibility that Barney might be there, too.\r\nShe thought that perhaps she ought to be ashamed for this, but she\r\nwasn’t. After her feeling of relief her next feeling was one of\r\nannoyance with Barney for coming there unshaved. Surely he might have\r\nenough self-respect to groom himself up decently when he went to a\r\nparty. There he was, bareheaded, bristly-chinned, in his old trousers\r\nand his blue homespun shirt. Not even a coat. Valancy could have shaken\r\nhim in her anger. No wonder people believed everything bad of him.\r\n\r\nBut she was not afraid any longer. One of the whispering group left his\r\ncomrades and came across the room to her, through the whirling couples\r\nthat now filled it uncomfortably. He was a tall, broad-shouldered\r\nfellow, not ill-dressed or ill-looking but unmistakably half drunk. He\r\nasked Valancy to dance. Valancy declined civilly. His face turned\r\nlivid. He threw his arm about her and pulled her to him. His hot,\r\nwhiskied breath burned her face.\r\n\r\n“We won’t have fine-lady airs here, my girl. If you ain’t too good to\r\ncome here you ain’t too good to dance with us. Me and my pals have been\r\nwatching you. You’ve got to give us each a turn and a kiss to boot.”\r\n\r\nValancy tried desperately and vainly to free herself. She was being\r\ndragged out into the maze of shouting, stamping, yelling dancers. The\r\nnext moment the man who held her went staggering across the room from a\r\nneatly planted blow on the jaw, knocking down whirling couples as he\r\nwent. Valancy felt her arm grasped.\r\n\r\n“This way—quick,” said Barney Snaith. He swung her out through the open\r\nwindow behind them, vaulted lightly over the sill and caught her hand.\r\n\r\n“Quick—we must run for it—they’ll be after us.”\r\n\r\nValancy ran as she had never run before, clinging tight to Barney’s\r\nhand, wondering why she did not drop dead in such a mad scamper.\r\nSuppose she did! What a scandal it would make for her poor people. For\r\nthe first time Valancy felt a little sorry for them. Also, she felt\r\nglad that she had escaped from that horrible row. Also, glad that she\r\nwas holding tight to Barney’s hand. Her feelings were badly mixed and\r\nshe had never had so many in such a brief time in her life.\r\n\r\nThey finally reached a quiet corner in the pine woods. The pursuit had\r\ntaken a different direction and the whoops and yells behind them were\r\ngrowing faint. Valancy, out of breath, with a crazily beating heart,\r\ncollapsed on the trunk of a fallen pine.\r\n\r\n“Thanks,” she gasped.\r\n\r\n“What a goose you were to come to such a place!” said Barney.\r\n\r\n“I—didn’t—know—it—would—be like this,” protested Valancy.\r\n\r\n“You _should_ have known. Chidley Corners!”\r\n\r\n“It—was—just—a name—to me.”\r\n\r\nValancy knew Barney could not realise how ignorant she was of the\r\nregions “up back.” She had lived in Deerwood all her life and of course\r\nhe supposed she knew. He didn’t know how she had been brought up. There\r\nwas no use trying to explain.\r\n\r\n“When I drifted in at Abel’s this evening and Cissy told me you’d come\r\nhere I was amazed. And downright scared. Cissy told me she was worried\r\nabout you but hadn’t liked to say anything to dissuade you for fear\r\nyou’d think she was thinking selfishly about herself. So I came on up\r\nhere instead of going to Deerwood.”\r\n\r\nValancy felt a sudden delightful glow irradiating soul and body under\r\nthe dark pines. So he had actually come up to look after her.\r\n\r\n“As soon as they stop hunting for us we’ll sneak around to the Muskoka\r\nroad. I left Lady Jane down there. I’ll take you home. I suppose you’ve\r\nhad enough of your party.”\r\n\r\n“Quite,” said Valancy meekly. The first half of the way home neither of\r\nthem said anything. It would not have been much use. Lady Jane made so\r\nmuch noise they could not have heard each other. Anyway, Valancy did\r\nnot feel conversationally inclined. She was ashamed of the whole\r\naffair—ashamed of her folly in going—ashamed of being found in such a\r\nplace by Barney Snaith. By Barney Snaith, reputed jail-breaker,\r\ninfidel, forger and defaulter. Valancy’s lips twitched in the darkness\r\nas she thought of it. But she _was_ ashamed.\r\n\r\nAnd yet she was enjoying herself—was full of a strange\r\nexultation—bumping over that rough road beside Barney Snaith. The big\r\ntrees shot by them. The tall mulleins stood up along the road in stiff,\r\norderly ranks like companies of soldiers. The thistles looked like\r\ndrunken fairies or tipsy elves as their car-lights passed over them.\r\nThis was the first time she had even been in a car. After all, she\r\nliked it. She was not in the least afraid, with Barney at the wheel.\r\nHer spirits rose rapidly as they tore along. She ceased to feel\r\nashamed. She ceased to feel anything except that she was part of a\r\ncomet rushing gloriously through the night of space.\r\n\r\nAll at once, just where the pine woods frayed out to the scrub barrens,\r\nLady Jane became quiet—too quiet. Lady Jane slowed down quietly—and\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\nBarney uttered an aghast exclamation. Got out. Investigated. Came\r\napologetically back.\r\n\r\n“I’m a doddering idiot. Out of gas. I knew I was short when I left\r\nhome, but I meant to fill up in Deerwood. Then I forgot all about it in\r\nmy hurry to get to the Corners.”\r\n\r\n“What can we do?” asked Valancy coolly.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. There’s no gas nearer than Deerwood, nine miles away.\r\nAnd I don’t dare leave you here alone. There are always tramps on this\r\nroad—and some of those crazy fools back at the Corners may come\r\nstraggling along presently. There were boys there from the Port. As far\r\nas I can see, the best thing to do is for us just to sit patiently here\r\nuntil some car comes along and lends us enough gas to get to Roaring\r\nAbel’s with.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what’s the matter with that?” said Valancy.\r\n\r\n“We may have to sit here all night,” said Barney.\r\n\r\n“I don’t mind,” said Valancy.\r\n\r\nBarney gave a short laugh. “If you don’t, I needn’t. I haven’t any\r\nreputation to lose.”\r\n\r\n“Nor I,” said Valancy comfortably."

      "content": "“We’ll just sit here,” said Barney, “and if we think of anything worth\r\nwhile saying we’ll say it. Otherwise, not. Don’t imagine you’re bound\r\nto talk to me.”\r\n\r\n“John Foster says,” quoted Valancy, “‘If you can sit in silence with a\r\nperson for half an hour and yet be entirely comfortable, you and that\r\nperson can be friends. If you cannot, friends you’ll never be and you\r\nneed not waste time in trying.’”\r\n\r\n“Evidently John Foster says a sensible thing once in a while,” conceded\r\nBarney.\r\n\r\nThey sat in silence for a long while. Little rabbits hopped across the\r\nroad. Once or twice an owl laughed out delightfully. The road beyond\r\nthem was fringed with the woven shadow lace of trees. Away off to the\r\nsouthwest the sky was full of silvery little cirrus clouds above the\r\nspot where Barney’s island must be.\r\n\r\nValancy was perfectly happy. Some things dawn on you slowly. Some\r\nthings come by lightning flashes. Valancy had had a lightning flash.\r\n\r\nShe knew quite well now that she loved Barney. Yesterday she had been\r\nall her own. Now she was this man’s. Yet he had done nothing—said\r\nnothing. He had not even looked at her as a woman. But that didn’t\r\nmatter. Nor did it matter what he was or what he had done. She loved\r\nhim without any reservations. Everything in her went out wholly to him.\r\nShe had no wish to stifle or disown her love. She seemed to be his so\r\nabsolutely that thought apart from him—thought in which he did not\r\npredominate—was an impossibility.\r\n\r\nShe had realised, quite simply and fully, that she loved him, in the\r\nmoment when he was leaning on the car door, explaining that Lady Jane\r\nhad no gas. She had looked deep into his eyes in the moonlight and had\r\nknown. In just that infinitesimal space of time everything was changed.\r\nOld things passed away and all things became new.\r\n\r\nShe was no longer unimportant, little, old maid Valancy Stirling. She\r\nwas a woman, full of love and therefore rich and significant—justified\r\nto herself. Life was no longer empty and futile, and death could cheat\r\nher of nothing. Love had cast out her last fear.\r\n\r\nLove! What a searing, torturing, intolerably sweet thing it was—this\r\npossession of body, soul and mind! With something at its core as fine\r\nand remote and purely spiritual as the tiny blue spark in the heart of\r\nthe unbreakable diamond. No dream had ever been like this. She was no\r\nlonger solitary. She was one of a vast sisterhood—all the women who had\r\never loved in the world.\r\n\r\nBarney need never know it—though she would not in the least have minded\r\nhis knowing. But _she_ knew it and it made a tremendous difference to\r\nher. Just to love! She did not ask to be loved. It was rapture enough\r\njust to sit there beside him in silence, alone in the summer night in\r\nthe white splendour of moonshine, with the wind blowing down on them\r\nout of the pine woods. She had always envied the wind. So free. Blowing\r\nwhere it listed. Through the hills. Over the lakes. What a tang, what a\r\nzip it had! What a magic of adventure! Valancy felt as if she had\r\nexchanged her shop-worn soul for a fresh one, fire-new from the\r\nworkshop of the gods. As far back as she could look, life had been\r\ndull—colourless—savourless. Now she had come to a little patch of\r\nviolets, purple and fragrant—hers for the plucking. No matter who or\r\nwhat had been in Barney’s past—no matter who or what might be in his\r\nfuture—no one else could ever have this perfect hour. She surrendered\r\nherself utterly to the charm of the moment.\r\n\r\n“Ever dream of ballooning?” said Barney suddenly.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Valancy.\r\n\r\n“I do—often. Dream of sailing through the clouds—seeing the glories of\r\nsunset—spending hours in the midst of a terrific storm with lightning\r\nplaying above and below you—skimming above a silver cloud floor under a\r\nfull moon—wonderful!”\r\n\r\n“It does sound so,” said Valancy. “I’ve stayed on earth in my dreams.”\r\n\r\nShe told him about her Blue Castle. It was so easy to tell Barney\r\nthings. One felt he understood everything—even the things you didn’t\r\ntell him. And then she told him a little of her existence before she\r\ncame to Roaring Abel’s. She wanted him to see why she had gone to the\r\ndance “up back.”\r\n\r\n“You see—I’ve never had any real life,” she said. “I’ve just—breathed.\r\nEvery door has always been shut to me.”\r\n\r\n“But you’re still young,” said Barney.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I know. Yes, I’m ‘still young’—but that’s so different from\r\n_young_,” said Valancy bitterly. For a moment she was tempted to tell\r\nBarney why her years had nothing to do with her future; but she did\r\nnot. She was not going to think of death tonight.\r\n\r\n“Though I never was really young,” she went on—“until tonight,” she\r\nadded in her heart. “I never had a life like other girls. You couldn’t\r\nunderstand. Why,”—she had a desperate desire that Barney should know\r\nthe worst about her—“I didn’t even love my mother. Isn’t it awful that\r\nI don’t love my mother?”\r\n\r\n“Rather awful—for her,” said Barney drily.\r\n\r\n“Oh, she didn’t know it. She took my love for granted. And I wasn’t any\r\nuse or comfort to her or anybody. I was just a—a—vegetable. And I got\r\ntired of it. That’s why I came to keep house for Mr. Gay and look after\r\nCissy.”\r\n\r\n“And I suppose your people thought you’d gone mad.”\r\n\r\n“They did—and do—literally,” said Valancy. “But it’s a comfort to them.\r\nThey’d rather believe me mad than bad. There’s no other alternative.\r\nBut I’ve been _living_ since I came to Mr. Gay’s. It’s been a\r\ndelightful experience. I suppose I’ll pay for it when I have to go\r\nback—but I’ll have _had_ it.”\r\n\r\n“That’s true,” said Barney. “If you buy your experience it’s your own.\r\nSo it’s no matter how much you pay for it. Somebody else’s experience\r\ncan never be yours. Well, it’s a funny old world.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think it really is old?” asked Valancy dreamily. “I never\r\nbelieve _that_ in June. It seems so young tonight—somehow. In that\r\nquivering moonlight—like a young, white girl—waiting.”\r\n\r\n“Moonlight here on the verge of up back is different from moonlight\r\nanywhere else,” agreed Barney. “It always makes me feel so clean,\r\nsomehow—body and soul. And of course the age of gold always comes back\r\nin spring.”\r\n\r\nIt was ten o’clock now. A dragon of black cloud ate up the moon. The\r\nspring air grew chill—Valancy shivered. Barney reached back into the\r\ninnards of Lady Jane and clawed up an old, tobacco-scented overcoat.\r\n\r\n“Put that on,” he ordered.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you want it yourself?” protested Valancy.\r\n\r\n“No. I’m not going to have you catching cold on my hands.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I won’t catch cold. I haven’t had a cold since I came to Mr.\r\nGay’s—though I’ve done the foolishest things. It’s funny, too—I used to\r\nhave them all the time. I feel so selfish taking your coat.”\r\n\r\n“You’ve sneezed three times. No use winding up your ‘experience’ up\r\nback with grippe or pneumonia.”\r\n\r\nHe pulled it up tight about her throat and buttoned it on her. Valancy\r\nsubmitted with secret delight. How nice it was to have some one look\r\nafter you so! She snuggled down into the tobaccoey folds and wished the\r\nnight could last forever.\r\n\r\nTen minutes later a car swooped down on them from “up back.” Barney\r\nsprang from Lady Jane and waved his hand. The car came to a stop beside\r\nthem. Valancy saw Uncle Wellington and Olive gazing at her in horror\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nSo Uncle Wellington had got a car! And he must have been spending the\r\nevening up at Mistawis with Cousin Herbert. Valancy almost laughed\r\naloud at the expression on his face as he recognised her. The pompous,\r\nbewhiskered old humbug!\r\n\r\n“Can you let me have enough gas to take me to Deerwood?” Barney was\r\nasking politely. But Uncle Wellington was not attending to him.\r\n\r\n“Valancy, how came you _here_!” he said sternly.\r\n\r\n“By chance or God’s grace,” said Valancy.\r\n\r\n“With this jail-bird—at ten o’clock at night!” said Uncle Wellington.\r\n\r\nValancy turned to Barney. The moon had escaped from its dragon and in\r\nits light her eyes were full of deviltry.\r\n\r\n“_Are_ you a jail-bird?”\r\n\r\n“Does it matter?” said Barney, gleams of fun in _his_ eyes.\r\n\r\n“Not to me. I only asked out of curiosity,” continued Valancy.\r\n\r\n“Then I won’t tell you. I never satisfy curiosity.” He turned to Uncle\r\nWellington and his voice changed subtly.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Stirling, I asked you if you could let me have some gas. If you\r\ncan, well and good. If not, we are only delaying you unnecessarily.”\r\n\r\nUncle Wellington was in a horrible dilemma. To give gas to this\r\nshameless pair! But not to give it to them! To go away and leave them\r\nthere in the Mistawis woods—until daylight, likely. It was better to\r\ngive it to them and let them get out of sight before any one else saw\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“Got anything to get gas in?” he grunted surlily.\r\n\r\nBarney produced a two-gallon measure from Lady Jane. The two men went\r\nto the rear of the Stirling car and began manipulating the tap. Valancy\r\nstole sly glances at Olive over the collar of Barney’s coat. Olive was\r\nsitting grimly staring straight ahead with an outraged expression. She\r\ndid not mean to take any notice of Valancy. Olive had her own secret\r\nreasons for feeling outraged. Cecil had been in Deerwood lately and of\r\ncourse had heard all about Valancy. He agreed that her mind was\r\nderanged and was exceedingly anxious to find out whence the derangement\r\nhad been inherited. It was a serious thing to have in the family—a very\r\nserious thing. One had to think of one’s—descendants.\r\n\r\n“She got it from the Wansbarras,” said Olive positively. “There’s\r\nnothing like that in the Stirlings—nothing!”\r\n\r\n“I hope not—I certainly hope not,” Cecil had responded dubiously. “But\r\nthen—to go out as a servant—for that is what it practically amounts to.\r\nYour cousin!”\r\n\r\nPoor Olive felt the implication. The Port Lawrence Prices were not\r\naccustomed to ally themselves with families whose members “worked out.”\r\n\r\nValancy could not resist temptation. She leaned forward.\r\n\r\n“Olive, does it hurt?”\r\n\r\nOlive bit—stiffly.\r\n\r\n“Does _what_ hurt?”\r\n\r\n“Looking like that.”\r\n\r\nFor a moment Olive resolved she would take no further notice of\r\nValancy. Then duty came uppermost. She must not miss the opportunity.\r\n\r\n“Doss,” she implored, leaning forward also, “won’t you come home—come\r\nhome tonight?”\r\n\r\nValancy yawned.\r\n\r\n“You sound like a revival meeting,” she said. “You really do.”\r\n\r\n“If you will come back——”\r\n\r\n“All will be forgiven.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Olive eagerly. Wouldn’t it be splendid if _she_ could\r\ninduce the prodigal daughter to return? “We’ll never cast it up to you.\r\nDoss, there are nights when I cannot sleep for thinking of you.”\r\n\r\n“And me having the time of my life,” said Valancy, laughing.\r\n\r\n“Doss, I can’t believe you’re bad. I’ve always said you couldn’t be\r\nbad——”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe I can be,” said Valancy. “I’m afraid I’m hopelessly\r\nproper. I’ve been sitting here for three hours with Barney Snaith and\r\nhe hasn’t even tried to kiss me. I wouldn’t have minded if he had,\r\nOlive.”\r\n\r\nValancy was still leaning forward. Her little hat with its crimson rose\r\nwas tilted down over one eye. Olive stared. In the moonlight Valancy’s\r\neyes—Valancy’s smile—what had happened to Valancy! She looked—not\r\npretty—Doss couldn’t be pretty—but provocative, fascinating—yes,\r\nabominably so. Olive drew back. It was beneath her dignity to say more.\r\nAfter all, Valancy must be both mad _and_ bad.\r\n\r\n“Thanks—that’s enough,” said Barney behind the car. “Much obliged, Mr.\r\nStirling. Two gallons—seventy cents. Thank you.”\r\n\r\nUncle Wellington climbed foolishly and feebly into his car. He wanted\r\nto give Snaith a piece of his mind, but dared not. Who knew what the\r\ncreature might do if provoked? No doubt he carried firearms.\r\n\r\nUncle Wellington looked indecisively at Valancy. But Valancy had turned\r\nher back on him and was watching Barney pour the gas into Lady Jane’s\r\nmaw.\r\n\r\n“Drive on,” said Olive decisively. “There’s no use in waiting here. Let\r\nme tell you what she said to me.”\r\n\r\n“The little hussy! The shameless little hussy!” said Uncle Wellington."

      "content": "The next thing the Stirlings heard was that Valancy had been seen with\r\nBarney Snaith in a movie theatre in Port Lawrence and after it at\r\nsupper in a Chinese restaurant there. This was quite true—and no one\r\nwas more surprised at it than Valancy herself. Barney had come along in\r\nLady Jane one dim twilight and told Valancy unceremoniously if she\r\nwanted a drive to hop in.\r\n\r\n“I’m going to the Port. Will you go there with me?”\r\n\r\nHis eyes were teasing and there was a bit of defiance in his voice.\r\nValancy, who did not conceal from herself that she would have gone\r\nanywhere with him to any place, “hopped in” without more ado. They tore\r\ninto and through Deerwood. Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles, taking a\r\nlittle air on the verandah, saw them whirl by in a cloud of dust and\r\nsought comfort in each other’s eyes. Valancy, who in some dim\r\npre-existence had been afraid of a car, was hatless and her hair was\r\nblowing wildly round her face. She would certainly come down with\r\nbronchitis—and die at Roaring Abel’s. She wore a low-necked dress and\r\nher arms were bare. That Snaith creature was in his shirt-sleeves,\r\nsmoking a pipe. They were going at the rate of forty miles an\r\nhour—sixty, Cousin Stickles averred. Lady Jane could hit the pike when\r\nshe wanted to. Valancy waved her hand gaily to her relatives. As for\r\nMrs. Frederick, she was wishing she knew how to go into hysterics.\r\n\r\n“Was it for this,” she demanded in hollow tones, “that I suffered the\r\npangs of motherhood?”\r\n\r\n“I will _not_ believe,” said Cousin Stickles solemnly, “that our prayers\r\nwill not yet be answered.”\r\n\r\n“Who—_who_ will protect that unfortunate girl when I am gone?” moaned\r\nMrs. Frederick.\r\n\r\nAs for Valancy, she was wondering if it could really be only a few\r\nweeks since she had sat there with them on that verandah. Hating the\r\nrubber-plant. Pestered with teasing questions like black flies. Always\r\nthinking of appearances. Cowed because of Aunt Wellington’s teaspoons\r\nand Uncle Benjamin’s money. Poverty-stricken. Afraid of everybody.\r\nEnvying Olive. A slave to moth-eaten traditions. Nothing to hope for or\r\nexpect.\r\n\r\nAnd now every day was a gay adventure.\r\n\r\nLady Jane flew over the fifteen miles between Deerwood and the\r\nPort—through the Port. The way Barney went past traffic policemen was\r\nnot holy. The lights were beginning to twinkle out like stars in the\r\nclear, lemon-hued twilight air. This was the only time Valancy ever\r\nreally liked the town, and she was crazy with the delight of speeding.\r\nWas it possible she had ever been afraid of a car? She was perfectly\r\nhappy, riding beside Barney. Not that she deluded herself into thinking\r\nit had any significance. She knew quite well that Barney had asked her\r\nto go on the impulse of the moment—an impulse born of a feeling of pity\r\nfor her and her starved little dreams. She was looking tired after a\r\nwakeful night with a heart attack, followed by a busy day. She had so\r\nlittle fun. He’d give her an outing for once. Besides, Abel was in the\r\nkitchen, at the point of drunkenness where he was declaring he did not\r\nbelieve in God and beginning to sing ribald songs. It was just as well\r\nshe should be out of the way for a while. Barney knew Roaring Abel’s\r\nrepertoire.\r\n\r\nThey went to the movie—Valancy had never been to a movie. And then,\r\nfinding a nice hunger upon them, they went and had fried\r\nchicken—unbelievably delicious—in the Chinese restaurant. After which\r\nthey rattled home again, leaving a devastating trail of scandal behind\r\nthem. Mrs. Frederick gave up going to church altogether. She could not\r\nendure her friends’ pitying glances and questions. But Cousin Stickles\r\nwent every Sunday. She said they had been given a cross to bear."

      "content": "On one of Cissy’s wakeful nights, she told Valancy her poor little\r\nstory. They were sitting by the open window. Cissy could not get her\r\nbreath lying down that night. An inglorious gibbous moon was hanging\r\nover the wooded hills and in its spectral light Cissy looked frail and\r\nlovely and incredibly young. A child. It did not seem possible that she\r\ncould have lived through all the passion and pain and shame of her\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n“He was stopping at the hotel across the lake. He used to come over in\r\nhis canoe at night—we met in the pines down the shore. He was a young\r\ncollege student—his father was a rich man in Toronto. Oh, Valancy, I\r\ndidn’t mean to be bad—I didn’t, indeed. But I loved him so—I love him\r\nyet—I’ll always love him. And I—didn’t know—some things. I\r\ndidn’t—understand. Then his father came and took him away. And—after a\r\nlittle—I found out—oh, Valancy,—I was so frightened. I didn’t know what\r\nto do. I wrote him—and he came. He—he said he would marry me, Valancy.”\r\n\r\n“And why—and why?——”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Valancy, he didn’t love me any more. I saw that at a glance. He—he\r\nwas just offering to marry me because he thought he ought to—because he\r\nwas sorry for me. He wasn’t bad—but he was so young—and what was I that\r\nhe should keep on loving me?”\r\n\r\n“Never mind making excuses for him,” said Valancy a bit shortly. “So\r\nyou wouldn’t marry him?”\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t—not when he didn’t love me any more. Somehow—I can’t\r\nexplain—it seemed a worse thing to do than—the other. He—he argued a\r\nlittle—but he went away. Do you think I did right, Valancy?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do. _You_ did right. But he——”\r\n\r\n“Don’t blame him, dear. Please don’t. Let’s not talk about him at all.\r\nThere’s no need. I wanted to tell you how it was—I didn’t want you to\r\nthink me bad——”\r\n\r\n“I never did think so.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I felt that—whenever you came. Oh, Valancy, what you’ve been to\r\nme! I can never tell you—but God will bless you for it. I know He\r\nwill—‘with what measure ye mete.’”\r\n\r\nCissy sobbed for a few minutes in Valancy’s arms. Then she wiped her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n“Well, that’s almost all. I came home. I wasn’t really so very unhappy.\r\nI suppose I should have been—but I wasn’t. Father wasn’t hard on me.\r\nAnd my baby was so sweet while he lived. I was even happy—I loved him\r\nso much, the dear little thing. He was so sweet, Valancy—with such\r\nlovely blue eyes—and little rings of pale gold hair like silk floss—and\r\ntiny dimpled hands. I used to bite his satin-smooth little face all\r\nover—softly, so as not to hurt him, you know——”\r\n\r\n“I know,” said Valancy, wincing. “I know—a woman _always_ knows—and\r\ndreams——”\r\n\r\n“And he was _all_ mine. Nobody else had any claim on him. When he died,\r\noh, Valancy, I thought I must die too—I didn’t see how anybody could\r\nendure such anguish and live. To see his dear little eyes and know he\r\nwould never open them again—to miss his warm little body nestled\r\nagainst mine at night and think of him sleeping alone and cold, his wee\r\nface under the hard frozen earth. It was so awful for the first\r\nyear—after that it was a little easier, one didn’t keep thinking ‘this\r\nday last year’—but I was so glad when I found out I was dying.”\r\n\r\n“‘Who could endure life if it were not for the hope of death?’”\r\nmurmured Valancy softly—it was of course a quotation from some book of\r\nJohn Foster’s.\r\n\r\n“I’m glad I’ve told you all about it,” sighed Cissy. “I wanted you to\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\nCissy died a few nights after that. Roaring Abel was away. When Valancy\r\nsaw the change that had come over Cissy’s face she wanted to telephone\r\nfor the doctor. But Cissy wouldn’t let her.\r\n\r\n“Valancy, why should you? He can do nothing for me. I’ve known for\r\nseveral days that—this—was near. Let me die in peace, dear—just holding\r\nyour hand. Oh, I’m so glad you’re here. Tell Father good-bye for me.\r\nHe’s always been as good to me as he knew how—and Barney. Somehow, I\r\nthink that Barney——”\r\n\r\nBut a spasm of coughing interrupted and exhausted her. She fell asleep\r\nwhen it was over, still holding to Valancy’s hand. Valancy sat there in\r\nthe silence. She was not frightened—or even sorry. At sunrise Cissy\r\ndied. She opened her eyes and looked past Valancy at\r\nsomething—something that made her smile suddenly and happily. And,\r\nsmiling, she died.\r\n\r\nValancy crossed Cissy’s hands on her breast and went to the open\r\nwindow. In the eastern sky, amid the fires of sunrise, an old moon was\r\nhanging—as slender and lovely as a new moon. Valancy had never seen an\r\nold, old moon before. She watched it pale and fade until it paled and\r\nfaded out of sight in the living rose of day. A little pool in the\r\nbarrens shone in the sunrise like a great golden lily.\r\n\r\nBut the world suddenly seemed a colder place to Valancy. Again nobody\r\nneeded her. She was not in the least sorry Cecilia was dead. She was\r\nonly sorry for all her suffering in life. But nobody could ever hurt\r\nher again. Valancy had always thought death dreadful. But Cissy had\r\ndied so quietly—so pleasantly. And at the very last—something—had made\r\nup to her for everything. She was lying there now, in her white sleep,\r\nlooking like a child. Beautiful! All the lines of shame and pain gone.\r\n\r\nRoaring Abel drove in, justifying his name. Valancy went down and told\r\nhim. The shock sobered him at once. He slumped down on the seat of his\r\nbuggy, his great head hanging.\r\n\r\n“Cissy dead—Cissy dead,” he said vacantly. “I didn’t think it would ’a’\r\ncome so soon. Dead. She used to run down the lane to meet me with a\r\nlittle white rose stuck in her hair. Cissy used to be a pretty little\r\ngirl. And a good little girl.”\r\n\r\n“She has always been a good little girl,” said Valancy."

      "content": "Valancy herself made Cissy ready for burial. No hands but hers should\r\ntouch that pitiful, wasted little body. The old house was spotless on\r\nthe day of the funeral. Barney Snaith was not there. He had done all he\r\ncould to help Valancy before it—he had shrouded the pale Cecilia in\r\nwhite roses from the garden—and then had gone back to his island. But\r\neverybody else was there. All Deerwood and “up back” came. They forgave\r\nCissy splendidly at last. Mr. Bradly gave a very beautiful funeral\r\naddress. Valancy had wanted her old Free Methodist man, but Roaring\r\nAbel was obdurate. He was a Presbyterian and no one but a Presbyterian\r\nminister should bury _his_ daughter. Mr. Bradly was very tactful. He\r\navoided all dubious points and it was plain to be seen he hoped for the\r\nbest. Six reputable citizens of Deerwood bore Cecilia Gay to her grave\r\nin decorous Deerwood cemetery. Among them was Uncle Wellington.\r\n\r\nThe Stirlings all came to the funeral, men and women. They had had a\r\nfamily conclave over it. Surely now that Cissy Gay was dead Valancy\r\nwould come home. She simply could not stay there with Roaring Abel.\r\nThat being the case, the wisest course—decreed Uncle James—was to\r\nattend the funeral—legitimise the whole thing, so to speak—show\r\nDeerwood that Valancy had really done a most creditable deed in going\r\nto nurse poor Cecilia Gay and that her family backed her up in it.\r\nDeath, the miracle worker, suddenly made the thing quite respectable.\r\nIf Valancy would return to home and decency while public opinion was\r\nunder its influence all might yet be well. Society was suddenly\r\nforgetting all Cecilia’s wicked doings and remembering what a pretty,\r\nmodest little thing she had been—“and motherless, you know—motherless!”\r\nIt was the psychological moment—said Uncle James.\r\n\r\nSo the Stirlings went to the funeral. Even Cousin Gladys’ neuritis\r\nallowed her to come. Cousin Stickles was there, her bonnet dripping all\r\nover her face, crying as woefully as if Cissy had been her nearest and\r\ndearest. Funerals always brought Cousin Stickles’ “own sad bereavement”\r\nback.\r\n\r\nAnd Uncle Wellington was a pall-bearer.\r\n\r\nValancy, pale, subdued-looking, her slanted eyes smudged with purple,\r\nin her snuff-brown dress, moving quietly about, finding seats for\r\npeople, consulting in undertones with minister and undertaker,\r\nmarshalling the “mourners” into the parlour, was so decorous and proper\r\nand Stirlingish that her family took heart of grace. This was not—could\r\nnot be—the girl who had sat all night in the woods with Barney\r\nSnaith—who had gone tearing bareheaded through Deerwood and Port\r\nLawrence. This was the Valancy they knew. Really, surprisingly capable\r\nand efficient. Perhaps she had always been kept down a bit too\r\nmuch—Amelia really was rather strict—hadn’t had a chance to show what\r\nwas in her. So thought the Stirlings. And Edward Beck, from the Port\r\nroad, a widower with a large family who was beginning to take notice,\r\ntook notice of Valancy and thought she might make a mighty fine second\r\nwife. No beauty—but a fifty-year-old widower, Mr. Beck told himself\r\nvery reasonably, couldn’t expect everything. Altogether, it seemed that\r\nValancy’s matrimonial chances were never so bright as they were at\r\nCecilia Gay’s funeral.\r\n\r\nWhat the Stirlings and Edward Beck would have thought had they known\r\nthe back of Valancy’s mind must be left to the imagination. Valancy was\r\nhating the funeral—hating the people who came to stare with curiosity\r\nat Cecilia’s marble-white face—hating the smugness—hating the dragging,\r\nmelancholy singing—hating Mr. Bradly’s cautious platitudes. If she\r\ncould have had her absurd way, there would have been no funeral at all.\r\nShe would have covered Cissy over with flowers, shut her away from\r\nprying eyes, and buried her beside her nameless little baby in the\r\ngrassy burying-ground under the pines of the “up back” church, with a\r\nbit of kindly prayer from the old Free Methodist minister. She\r\nremembered Cissy saying once, “I wish I could be buried deep in the\r\nheart of the woods where nobody would ever come to say, ‘Cissy Gay is\r\nburied here,’ and tell over my miserable story.”\r\n\r\nBut this! However, it would soon be over. Valancy knew, if the\r\nStirlings and Edward Beck didn’t, exactly what she intended to do then.\r\nShe had lain awake all the preceding night thinking about it and\r\nfinally deciding on it.\r\n\r\nWhen the funeral procession had left the house, Mrs. Frederick sought\r\nout Valancy in the kitchen.\r\n\r\n“My child,” she said tremulously, “you’ll come home _now_?”\r\n\r\n“Home,” said Valancy absently. She was getting on an apron and\r\ncalculating how much tea she must put to steep for supper. There would\r\nbe several guests from “up back”—distant relatives of the Gays’ who had\r\nnot remembered them for years. And she was so tired she wished she\r\ncould borrow a pair of legs from the cat.\r\n\r\n“Yes, home,” said Mrs. Frederick, with a touch of asperity. “I suppose\r\nyou won’t dream of staying here _now_—alone with Roaring Abel.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, I’m not going to stay _here_,” said Valancy. “Of course, I’ll\r\nhave to stay for a day or two, to put the house in order generally. But\r\nthat will be all. Excuse me, Mother, won’t you? I’ve a frightful lot to\r\ndo—all those ‘up back’ people will be here to supper.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Frederick retreated in considerable relief, and the Stirlings went\r\nhome with lighter hearts.\r\n\r\n“We will just treat her as if nothing had happened when she comes\r\nback,” decreed Uncle Benjamin. “That will be the best plan. Just as if\r\nnothing had happened.”"

      "content": "On the evening of the day after the funeral Roaring Abel went off for a\r\nspree. He had been sober for four whole days and could endure it no\r\nlonger. Before he went, Valancy told him she would be going away the\r\nnext day. Roaring Abel was sorry, and said so. A distant cousin from\r\n“up back” was coming to keep house for him—quite willing to do so now\r\nsince there was no sick girl to wait on—but Abel was not under any\r\ndelusions concerning her.\r\n\r\n“She won’t be like you, my girl. Well, I’m obliged to you. You helped\r\nme out of a bad hole and I won’t forget it. And I won’t forget what you\r\ndid for Cissy. I’m your friend, and if you ever want any of the\r\nStirlings spanked and sot in a corner send for me. I’m going to wet my\r\nwhistle. Lord, but I’m dry! Don’t reckon I’ll be back afore tomorrow\r\nnight, so if you’re going home tomorrow, good-bye now.”\r\n\r\n“I _may_ go home tomorrow,” said Valancy, “but I’m not going back to\r\nDeerwood.”\r\n\r\n“Not going——”\r\n\r\n“You’ll find the key on the woodshed nail,” interrupted Valancy,\r\npolitely and unmistakably. “The dog will be in the barn and the cat in\r\nthe cellar. Don’t forget to feed her till your cousin comes. The pantry\r\nis full and I made bread and pies today. Good-bye, Mr. Gay. You have\r\nbeen very kind to me and I appreciate it.”\r\n\r\n“We’ve had a d——d decent time of it together, and that’s a fact,” said\r\nRoaring Abel. “You’re the best small sport in the world, and your\r\nlittle finger is worth the whole Stirling clan tied together. Good-bye\r\nand good-luck.”\r\n\r\nValancy went out to the garden. Her legs trembled a little, but\r\notherwise she felt and looked composed. She held something tightly in\r\nher hand. The garden was lying in the magic of the warm, odorous July\r\ntwilight. A few stars were out and the robins were calling through the\r\nvelvety silences of the barrens. Valancy stood by the gate expectantly.\r\nWould he come? If he did not——\r\n\r\nHe was coming. Valancy heard Lady Jane Grey far back in the woods. Her\r\nbreath came a little more quickly. Nearer—and nearer—she could see Lady\r\nJane now—bumping down the lane—nearer—nearer—he was there—he had sprung\r\nfrom the car and was leaning over the gate, looking at her.\r\n\r\n“Going home, Miss Stirling?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know—yet,” said Valancy slowly. Her mind was made up, with no\r\nshadow of turning, but the moment was very tremendous.\r\n\r\n“I thought I’d run down and ask if there was anything I could do for\r\nyou,” said Barney.\r\n\r\nValancy took it with a canter.\r\n\r\n“Yes, there is something you can do for me,” she said, evenly and\r\ndistinctly. “Will you marry me?”\r\n\r\nFor a moment Barney was silent. There was no particular expression on\r\nhis face. Then he gave an odd laugh.\r\n\r\n“Come, now! I knew luck was just waiting around the corner for me. All\r\nthe signs have been pointing that way today.”\r\n\r\n“Wait.” Valancy lifted her hand. “I’m in earnest—but I want to get my\r\nbreath after that question. Of course, with my bringing up, I realise\r\nperfectly well that this is one of the things ‘a lady should not do.’”\r\n\r\n“But why—why?”\r\n\r\n“For two reasons.” Valancy was still a little breathless, but she\r\nlooked Barney straight in the eyes, while all the dead Stirlings\r\nrevolved rapidly in their graves and the living ones did nothing\r\nbecause they did not know that Valancy was at that moment proposing\r\nlawful marriage to the notorious Barney Snaith. “The first reason is,\r\nI—I”—Valancy tried to say “I love you” but could not. She had to take\r\nrefuge in a pretended flippancy. “I’m crazy about you. The second\r\nis—this.”\r\n\r\nShe handed him Dr. Trent’s letter.\r\n\r\nBarney opened it with the air of a man thankful to find some safe, sane\r\nthing to do. As he read it his face changed. He understood—more perhaps\r\nthan Valancy wanted him to.\r\n\r\n“Are you sure nothing can be done for you?”\r\n\r\nValancy did not misunderstand the question.\r\n\r\n“Yes. You know Dr. Trent’s reputation in regard to heart disease. I\r\nhaven’t long to live—perhaps only a few months—a few weeks. I want to\r\n_live_ them. I can’t go back to Deerwood—you know what my life was like\r\nthere. And”—she managed it this time—“I love you. I want to spend the\r\nrest of my life with you. That’s all.”\r\n\r\nBarney folded his arms on the gate and looked gravely enough at a\r\nwhite, saucy star that was winking at him just over Roaring Abel’s\r\nkitchen chimney.\r\n\r\n“You don’t know anything about me. I may be a—murderer.”\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t. You _may_ be something dreadful. Everything they say of\r\nyou may be true. But it doesn’t matter to me.”\r\n\r\n“You care that much for me, Valancy?” said Barney incredulously,\r\nlooking away from the star and into her eyes—her strange, mysterious\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n“I care—that much,” said Valancy in a low voice. She was trembling. He\r\nhad called her by her name for the first time. It was sweeter than\r\nanother man’s caress could have been just to hear him say her name like\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n“If we are going to get married,” said Barney, speaking suddenly in a\r\ncasual, matter-of-fact voice, “some things must be understood.”\r\n\r\n“Everything must be understood,” said Valancy.\r\n\r\n“I have things I want to hide,” said Barney coolly. “You are not to ask\r\nme about them.”\r\n\r\n“I won’t,” said Valancy.\r\n\r\n“You must never ask to see my mail.”\r\n\r\n“Never.”\r\n\r\n“And we are never to pretend anything to each other.”\r\n\r\n“We won’t,” said Valancy. “You won’t even have to pretend you like me.\r\nIf you marry me I know you’re only doing it out of pity.”\r\n\r\n“And we’ll never tell a lie to each other about anything—a big lie or a\r\npetty lie.”\r\n\r\n“Especially a petty lie,” agreed Valancy.\r\n\r\n“And you’ll have to live back on my island. I won’t live anywhere\r\nelse.”\r\n\r\n“That’s partly why I want to marry you,” said Valancy.\r\n\r\nBarney peered at her.\r\n\r\n“I believe you mean it. Well—let’s get married, then.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said Valancy, with a sudden return of primness. She would\r\nhave been much less embarrassed if he had refused her.\r\n\r\n“I suppose I haven’t any right to make conditions. But I’m going to\r\nmake one. You are never to refer to my heart or my liability to sudden\r\ndeath. You are never to urge me to be careful. You are to\r\nforget—absolutely forget—that I’m not perfectly healthy. I have written\r\na letter to my mother—here it is—you are to keep it. I have explained\r\neverything in it. If I drop dead suddenly—as I likely will do——”\r\n\r\n“It will exonerate me in the eyes of your kindred from the suspicion of\r\nhaving poisoned you,” said Barney with a grin.\r\n\r\n“Exactly.” Valancy laughed gaily. “Dear me, I’m glad this is over. It\r\nhas been—a bit of an ordeal. You see, I’m not in the habit of going\r\nabout asking men to marry me. It is so nice of you not to refuse me—or\r\noffer to be a brother!”\r\n\r\n“I’ll go to the Port tomorrow and get a license. We can be married\r\ntomorrow evening. Dr. Stalling, I suppose?”\r\n\r\n“Heavens, no.” Valancy shuddered. “Besides, he wouldn’t do it. He’d\r\nshake his forefinger at me and I’d jilt you at the altar. No, I want my\r\nold Mr. Towers to marry me.”\r\n\r\n“Will you marry me as I stand?” demanded Barney. A passing car, full of\r\ntourists, honked loudly—it seemed derisively. Valancy looked at him.\r\nBlue homespun shirt, nondescript hat, muddy overalls. Unshaved!\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she said.\r\n\r\nBarney put his hands over the gate and took her little, cold ones\r\ngently in his.\r\n\r\n“Valancy,” he said, trying to speak lightly, “of course I’m not in love\r\nwith you—never thought of such a thing as being in love. But, do you\r\nknow, I’ve always thought you were a bit of a dear.”"

      "content": "The next day passed for Valancy like a dream. She could not make\r\nherself or anything she did seem real. She saw nothing of Barney,\r\nthough she expected he must go rattling past on his way to the Port for\r\na license.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he had changed his mind.\r\n\r\nBut at dusk the lights of Lady Jane suddenly swooped over the crest of\r\nthe wooded hill beyond the lane. Valancy was waiting at the gate for\r\nher bridegroom. She wore her green dress and her green hat because she\r\nhad nothing else to wear. She did not look or feel at all\r\nbride-like—she really looked like a wild elf strayed out of the\r\ngreenwood. But that did not matter. Nothing at all mattered except that\r\nBarney was coming for her.\r\n\r\n“Ready?” said Barney, stopping Lady Jane with some new, horrible\r\nnoises.\r\n\r\n“Yes.” Valancy stepped in and sat down. Barney was in his blue shirt\r\nand overalls. But they were clean overalls. He was smoking a\r\nvillainous-looking pipe and he was bareheaded. But he had a pair of\r\noddly smart boots on under his shabby overalls. And he was shaved. They\r\nclattered into Deerwood and through Deerwood and hit the long, wooded\r\nroad to the Port.\r\n\r\n“Haven’t changed your mind?” said Barney.\r\n\r\n“No. Have you?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\nThat was their whole conversation on the fifteen miles. Everything was\r\nmore dream-like than ever. Valancy didn’t know whether she felt happy.\r\nOr terrified. Or just plain fool.\r\n\r\nThen the lights of Port Lawrence were about them. Valancy felt as if\r\nshe were surrounded by the gleaming, hungry eyes of hundreds of great,\r\nstealthy panthers. Barney briefly asked where Mr. Towers lived, and\r\nValancy as briefly told him. They stopped before the shabby little\r\nhouse in an unfashionable street. They went in to the small, shabby\r\nparlour. Barney produced his license. So he _had_ got it. Also a ring.\r\nThis thing was real. She, Valancy Stirling, was actually on the point\r\nof being married.\r\n\r\nThey were standing up together before Mr. Towers. Valancy heard Mr.\r\nTowers and Barney saying things. She heard some other person saying\r\nthings. She herself was thinking of the way she had once planned to be\r\nmarried—away back in her early teens when such a thing had not seemed\r\nimpossible. White silk and tulle veil and orange-blossoms; no\r\nbridesmaid. But one flower girl, in a frock of cream shadow lace over\r\npale pink, with a wreath of flowers in her hair, carrying a basket of\r\nroses and lilies-of-the-valley. And the groom, a noble-looking\r\ncreature, irreproachably clad in whatever the fashion of the day\r\ndecreed. Valancy lifted her eyes and saw herself and Barney in the\r\nlittle, slanting, distorting mirror over the mantelpiece. She in her\r\nodd, unbridal green hat and dress; Barney in shirt and overalls. But it\r\nwas Barney. That was all that mattered. No veil—no flowers—no guests—no\r\npresents—no wedding-cake—but just Barney. For all the rest of her life\r\nthere would be Barney.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Snaith, I hope you will be very happy,” Mr. Towers was saying.\r\n\r\nHe had not seemed surprised at their appearance—not even at Barney’s\r\noveralls. He had seen plenty of queer weddings “up back.” He did not\r\nknow Valancy was one of the Deerwood Stirlings—he did not even know\r\nthere _were_ Deerwood Stirlings. He did not know Barney Snaith was a\r\nfugitive from justice. Really, he was an incredibly ignorant old man.\r\nTherefore he married them and gave them his blessing very gently and\r\nsolemnly and prayed for them that night after they had gone away. His\r\nconscience did not trouble him at all.\r\n\r\n“What a nice way to get married!” Barney was saying as he put Lady Jane\r\nin gear. “No fuss and flub-dub. I never supposed it was half so easy.”\r\n\r\n“For heaven’s sake,” said Valancy suddenly, “let’s forget we _are_\r\nmarried and talk as if we weren’t. I can’t stand another drive like the\r\none we had coming in.”\r\n\r\nBarney howled and threw Lady Jane into high with an infernal noise.\r\n\r\n“And I thought I was making it easy for you,” he said. “You didn’t seem\r\nto want to talk.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t. But I wanted you to talk. I don’t want you to make love to\r\nme, but I want you to act like an ordinary human being. Tell me about\r\nthis island of yours. What sort of a place is it?”\r\n\r\n“The jolliest place in the world. You’re going to love it. The first\r\ntime I saw it I loved it. Old Tom MacMurray owned it then. He built the\r\nlittle shack on it, lived there in winter and rented it to Toronto\r\npeople in summer. I bought it from him—became by that one simple\r\ntransaction a landed proprietor owning a house and an island. There is\r\nsomething so satisfying in owning a whole island. And isn’t an\r\nuninhabited island a charming idea? I’d wanted to own one ever since\r\nI’d read _Robinson Crusoe_. It seemed too good to be true. And beauty!\r\nMost of the scenery belongs to the government, but they don’t tax you\r\nfor looking at it, and the moon belongs to everybody. You won’t find my\r\nshack very tidy. I suppose you’ll want to make it tidy.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Valancy honestly. “I _have_ to be tidy. I don’t really\r\n_want_ to be. But untidiness hurts me. Yes, I’ll have to tidy up your\r\nshack.”\r\n\r\n“I was prepared for that,” said Barney, with a hollow groan.\r\n\r\n“But,” continued Valancy relentingly, “I won’t insist on your wiping\r\nyour feet when you come in.”\r\n\r\n“No, you’ll only sweep up after me with the air of a martyr,” said\r\nBarney. “Well, anyway, you can’t tidy the lean-to. You can’t even enter\r\nit. The door will be locked and I shall keep the key.”\r\n\r\n“Bluebeard’s chamber,” said Valancy. “I shan’t even think of it. I\r\ndon’t care how many wives you have hanging up in it. So long as they’re\r\nreally dead.”\r\n\r\n“Dead as door-nails. You can do as you like in the rest of the house.\r\nThere’s not much of it—just one big living-room and one small bedroom.\r\nWell built, though. Old Tom loved his job. The beams of our house are\r\ncedar and the rafters fir. Our living-room windows face west and east.\r\nIt’s wonderful to have a room where you can see both sunrise and\r\nsunset. I have two cats there. Banjo and Good Luck. Adorable animals.\r\nBanjo is a big, enchanting, grey devil-cat. Striped, of course. I don’t\r\ncare a hang for any cat that hasn’t stripes. I never knew a cat who\r\ncould swear as genteelly and effectively as Banjo. His only fault is\r\nthat he snores horribly when he is asleep. Luck is a dainty little cat.\r\nAlways looking wistfully at you, as if he wanted to tell you something.\r\nMaybe he will pull it off sometime. Once in a thousand years, you know,\r\none cat is allowed to speak. My cats are philosophers—neither of them\r\never cries over spilt milk.\r\n\r\n“Two old crows live in a pine-tree on the point and are reasonably\r\nneighbourly. Call ’em Nip and Tuck. And I have a demure little tame\r\nowl. Name, Leander. I brought him up from a baby and he lives over on\r\nthe mainland and chuckles to himself o’ nights. And bats—it’s a great\r\nplace for bats at night. Scared of bats?”\r\n\r\n“No; I like them.”\r\n\r\n“So do I. Nice, queer, uncanny, mysterious creatures. Coming from\r\nnowhere—going nowhere. Swoop! Banjo likes ’em, too. Eats ’em. I have a\r\ncanoe and a disappearing propeller boat. Went to the Port in it today\r\nto get my license. Quieter than Lady Jane.”\r\n\r\n“I thought you hadn’t gone at all—that you _had_ changed your mind,”\r\nadmitted Valancy.\r\n\r\nBarney laughed—the laugh Valancy did not like—the little, bitter,\r\ncynical laugh.\r\n\r\n“I never change my mind,” he said shortly.\r\n\r\nThey went back through Deerwood. Up the Muskoka road. Past Roaring\r\nAbel’s. Over the rocky, daisied lane. The dark pine woods swallowed\r\nthem up. Through the pine woods, where the air was sweet with the\r\nincense of the unseen, fragile bells of the linnæas that carpeted the\r\nbanks of the trail. Out to the shore of Mistawis. Lady Jane must be\r\nleft here. They got out. Barney led the way down a little path to the\r\nedge of the lake.\r\n\r\n“There’s our island,” he said gloatingly.\r\n\r\nValancy looked—and looked—and looked again. There was a diaphanous,\r\nlilac mist on the lake, shrouding the island. Through it the two\r\nenormous pine-trees that clasped hands over Barney’s shack loomed out\r\nlike dark turrets. Behind them was a sky still rose-hued in the\r\nafterlight, and a pale young moon.\r\n\r\nValancy shivered like a tree the wind stirs suddenly. Something seemed\r\nto sweep over her soul.\r\n\r\n“My Blue Castle!” she said. “Oh, my Blue Castle!”\r\n\r\nThey got into the canoe and paddled out to it. They left behind the\r\nrealm of everyday and things known and landed on a realm of mystery and\r\nenchantment where anything might happen—anything might be true. Barney\r\nlifted Valancy out of the canoe and swung her to a lichen-covered rock\r\nunder a young pine-tree. His arms were about her and suddenly his lips\r\nwere on hers. Valancy found herself shivering with the rapture of her\r\nfirst kiss.\r\n\r\n“Welcome home, dear,” Barney was saying."

      "content": "Cousin Georgiana came down the lane leading up to her little house. She\r\nlived half a mile out of Deerwood and she wanted to go in to Amelia’s\r\nand find out if Doss had come home yet. Cousin Georgiana was anxious to\r\nsee Doss. She had something very important to tell her. Something, she\r\nwas sure, Doss would be delighted to hear. Poor Doss! She _had_ had\r\nrather a dull life of it. Cousin Georgiana owned to herself that _she_\r\nwould not like to live under Amelia’s thumb. But that would be all\r\nchanged now. Cousin Georgiana felt tremendously important. For the time\r\nbeing, she quite forgot to wonder which of them would go next.\r\n\r\nAnd here was Doss herself, coming along the road from Roaring Abel’s in\r\nsuch a queer green dress and hat. Talk about luck. Cousin Georgiana\r\nwould have a chance to impart her wonderful secret right away, with\r\nnobody else about to interrupt. It was, you might say, a Providence.\r\n\r\nValancy, who had been living for four days on her enchanted island, had\r\ndecided that she might as well go in to Deerwood and tell her relatives\r\nthat she was married. Otherwise, finding that she had disappeared from\r\nRoaring Abel’s, they might get out a search warrant for her. Barney had\r\noffered to drive her in, but she had preferred to go alone. She smiled\r\nvery radiantly at Cousin Georgiana, who, she remembered, as of some one\r\nknown a long time ago, had really been not a bad little creature.\r\nValancy was so happy that she could have smiled at anybody—even Uncle\r\nJames. She was not averse to Cousin Georgiana’s company. Already, since\r\nthe houses along the road were becoming numerous, she was conscious\r\nthat curious eyes were looking at her from every window.\r\n\r\n“I suppose you’re going home, dear Doss?” said Cousin Georgiana as she\r\nshook hands—furtively eyeing Valancy’s dress and wondering if she had\r\n_any_ petticoat on at all.\r\n\r\n“Sooner or later,” said Valancy cryptically.\r\n\r\n“Then I’ll go along with you. I’ve been wanting to see you _very_\r\nespecially, Doss dear. I’ve something quite _wonderful_ to tell you.”\r\n\r\n“Yes?” said Valancy absently. What on earth was Cousin Georgiana\r\nlooking so mysterious and important about? But did it matter? No.\r\nNothing mattered but Barney and the Blue Castle up back in Mistawis.\r\n\r\n“Who do you suppose called to see me the other day?” asked Cousin\r\nGeorgiana archly.\r\n\r\nValancy couldn’t guess.\r\n\r\n“Edward Beck.” Cousin Georgiana lowered her voice almost to a whisper.\r\n“_Edward Beck._”\r\n\r\nWhy the italics? And _was_ Cousin Georgiana blushing?\r\n\r\n“Who on earth is Edward Beck?” asked Valancy indifferently.\r\n\r\nCousin Georgiana stared.\r\n\r\n“Surely you remember Edward Beck,” she said reproachfully. “He lives in\r\nthat lovely house on the Port Lawrence road and he comes to our\r\nchurch—regularly. You _must_ remember him.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I think I do now,” said Valancy, with an effort of memory. “He’s\r\nthat old man with a wen on his forehead and dozens of children, who\r\nalways sits in the pew by the door, isn’t he?”\r\n\r\n“Not dozens of children, dear—oh, no, not dozens. Not even _one_ dozen.\r\nOnly nine. At least only nine that count. The rest are dead. He _isn’t_\r\nold—he’s only about forty-eight—the prime of life, Doss—and what does\r\nit matter about a wen?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, of course,” agreed Valancy quite sincerely. It certainly did\r\nnot matter to her whether Edward Beck had a wen or a dozen wens or no\r\nwen at all. But Valancy was getting vaguely suspicious. There was\r\ncertainly an air of suppressed triumph about Cousin Georgiana. Could it\r\nbe possible that Cousin Georgiana was thinking of marrying again?\r\nMarrying Edward Beck? Absurd. Cousin Georgiana was sixty-five if she\r\nwere a day and her little anxious face was as closely covered with fine\r\nwrinkles as if she had been a hundred. But still——\r\n\r\n“My dear,” said Cousin Georgiana, “Edward Beck wants to marry _you_.”\r\n\r\nValancy stared at Cousin Georgiana for a moment. Then she wanted to go\r\noff into a peal of laughter. But she only said:\r\n\r\n“Me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you. He fell in love with you at the funeral. And he came to\r\nconsult me about it. I was such a friend of his first wife, you know.\r\nHe is very much in earnest, Dossie. And it’s a wonderful chance for\r\nyou. He’s very well off—and you know—you—you——”\r\n\r\n“Am not so young as I once was,” agreed Valancy. “‘To her that hath\r\nshall be given.’ Do you really think I would make a good stepmother,\r\nCousin Georgiana?”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure you would. You were always so fond of children.”\r\n\r\n“But nine is such a family to start with,” objected Valancy gravely.\r\n\r\n“The two oldest are grown up and the third almost. That leaves only six\r\nthat really count. And most of them are boys. So much easier to bring\r\nup than girls. There’s an excellent book—‘Health Care of the Growing\r\nChild’—Gladys has a copy, I think. It would be such a help to you. And\r\nthere are books about morals. You’d manage nicely. Of course I told Mr.\r\nBeck that I thought you would—would——”\r\n\r\n“Jump at him,” supplied Valancy.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, no, dear. I wouldn’t use such an indelicate expression. I told\r\nhim I thought you would consider his proposal favourably. And you will,\r\nwon’t you, dearie?”\r\n\r\n“There’s only one obstacle,” said Valancy dreamily. “You see, I’m\r\nmarried already.”\r\n\r\n“Married!” Cousin Georgiana stopped stock-still and stared at Valancy.\r\n“Married!”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I was married to Barney Snaith last Tuesday evening in Port\r\nLawrence.”\r\n\r\nThere was a convenient gate-post hard by. Cousin Georgiana took firm\r\nhold of it.\r\n\r\n“Doss, dear—I’m an old woman—are you trying to make fun of me?”\r\n\r\n“Not at all. I’m only telling you the truth. For heaven’s sake, Cousin\r\nGeorgiana,”—Valancy was alarmed by certain symptoms—“don’t go crying\r\nhere on the public road!”\r\n\r\nCousin Georgiana choked back the tears and gave a little moan of\r\ndespair instead.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Doss, _what_ have you done? What _have_ you done?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve just been telling you. I’ve got married,” said Valancy, calmly\r\nand patiently.\r\n\r\n“To that—that—aw—that—_Barney Snaith_. Why, they say he’s had a dozen\r\nwives already.”\r\n\r\n“I’m the only one round at present,” said Valancy.\r\n\r\n“What will your poor mother say?” moaned Cousin Georgiana.\r\n\r\n“Come along with me and hear, if you want to know,” said Valancy. “I’m\r\non my way to tell her now.”\r\n\r\nCousin Georgiana let go the gate-post cautiously and found that she\r\ncould stand alone. She meekly trotted on beside Valancy—who suddenly\r\nseemed quite a different person in her eyes. Cousin Georgiana had a\r\ntremendous respect for a married woman. But it was terrible to think of\r\nwhat the poor girl had done. So rash. So reckless. Of course Valancy\r\nmust be stark mad. But she seemed so happy in her madness that Cousin\r\nGeorgiana had a momentary conviction that it would be a pity if the\r\nclan tried to scold her back to sanity. She had never seen that look in\r\nValancy’s eyes before. But what _would_ Amelia say? And Ben?\r\n\r\n“To marry a man you know nothing about,” thought Cousin Georgiana\r\naloud.\r\n\r\n“I know more about him than I know of Edward Beck,” said Valancy.\r\n\r\n“Edward Beck _goes to church_,” said Cousin Georgiana. “Does Bar—does\r\nyour husband?”\r\n\r\n“He has promised that he will go with me on fine Sundays,” said\r\nValancy.\r\n\r\nWhen they turned in at the Stirling gate Valancy gave an exclamation of\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n“Look at my rosebush! Why, it’s blooming!”\r\n\r\nIt was. Covered with blossoms. Great, crimson, velvety blossoms.\r\nFragrant. Glowing. Wonderful.\r\n\r\n“My cutting it to pieces must have done it good,” said Valancy,\r\nlaughing. She gathered a handful of the blossoms—they would look well\r\non the supper-table of the verandah at Mistawis—and went, still\r\nlaughing, up the walk, conscious that Olive was standing on the steps,\r\nOlive, goddess-like in loveliness, looking down with a slight frown on\r\nher forehead. Olive, beautiful, insolent. Her full form voluptuous in\r\nits swathings of rose silk and lace. Her golden-brown hair curling\r\nrichly under her big, white-frilled hat. Her colour ripe and melting.\r\n\r\n“Beautiful,” thought Valancy coolly, “but”—as if she suddenly saw her\r\ncousin through new eyes—“without the slightest touch of distinction.”\r\n\r\nSo Valancy had come home, thank goodness, thought Olive. But Valancy\r\nwas not looking like a repentant, returned prodigal. This was the cause\r\nof Olive’s frown. She was looking triumphant—graceless! That outlandish\r\ndress—that queer hat—those hands full of blood-red roses. Yet there was\r\nsomething about both dress and hat, as Olive instantly felt, that was\r\nentirely lacking in her own attire. This deepened the frown. She put\r\nout a condescending hand.\r\n\r\n“So you’re back, Doss? Very warm day, isn’t it? Did you walk in?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Coming in?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no. I’ve just been in. I’ve come often to comfort poor Aunty.\r\nShe’s been so lonesome. I’m going to Mrs. Bartlett’s tea. I have to\r\nhelp pour. She’s giving it for her cousin from Toronto. Such a charming\r\ngirl. You’d have loved meeting her, Doss. I think Mrs. Bartlett did\r\nsend you a card. Perhaps you’ll drop in later on.”\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t think so,” said Valancy indifferently. “I’ll have to be\r\nhome to get Barney’s supper. We’re going for a moonlit canoe ride\r\naround Mistawis tonight.”\r\n\r\n“Barney? Supper?” gasped Olive. “What _do_ you mean, Valancy Stirling?”\r\n\r\n“Valancy Snaith, by the grace of God.”\r\n\r\nValancy flaunted her wedding-ring in Olive’s stricken face. Then she\r\nnimbly stepped past her and into the house. Cousin Georgiana followed.\r\nShe would not miss a moment of the great scene, even though Olive did\r\nlook as if she were going to faint.\r\n\r\nOlive did not faint. She went stupidly down the street to Mrs.\r\nBartlett’s. _What_ did Doss mean? She couldn’t have—that ring—oh, what\r\nfresh scandal was that wretched girl bringing on her defenceless family\r\nnow? She should have been—shut up—long ago.\r\n\r\nValancy opened the sitting-room door and stepped unexpectedly right\r\ninto a grim assemblage of Stirlings. They had not come together of\r\nmalice prepense. Aunt Wellington and Cousin Gladys and Aunt Mildred and\r\nCousin Sarah had just called in on their way home from a meeting of the\r\nmissionary society. Uncle James had dropped in to give Amelia some\r\ninformation regarding a doubtful investment. Uncle Benjamin had called,\r\napparently, to tell them it was a hot day and ask them what was the\r\ndifference between a bee and a donkey. Cousin Stickles had been\r\ntactless enough to know the answer—“one gets all the honey, the other\r\nall the whacks”—and Uncle Benjamin was in a bad humour. In all of their\r\nminds, unexpressed, was the idea of finding out if Valancy had yet come\r\nhome, and, if not, what steps must be taken in the matter.\r\n\r\nWell, here was Valancy at last, a poised, confident thing, not humble\r\nand deprecating as she should have been. And so oddly, improperly\r\nyoung-looking. She stood in the doorway and looked at them, Cousin\r\nGeorgiana timorous, expectant, behind her. Valancy was so happy she\r\ndidn’t hate her people any more. She could even see a number of good\r\nqualities in them that she had never seen before. And she was sorry for\r\nthem. Her pity made her quite gentle.\r\n\r\n“Well, Mother,” she said pleasantly.\r\n\r\n“So you’ve come home at last!” said Mrs. Frederick, getting out a\r\nhandkerchief. She dared not be outraged, but she did not mean to be\r\ncheated of her tears.\r\n\r\n“Well, not exactly,” said Valancy. She threw her bomb. “I thought I\r\nought to drop in and tell you I was married. Last Tuesday night. To\r\nBarney Snaith.”\r\n\r\nUncle Benjamin bounced up and sat down again.\r\n\r\n“God bless my soul!” he said dully. The rest seemed turned to stone.\r\nExcept Cousin Gladys, who turned faint. Aunt Mildred and Uncle\r\nWellington had to help her out to the kitchen.\r\n\r\n“She would have to keep up the Victorian traditions,” said Valancy,\r\nwith a grin. She sat down, uninvited, on a chair. Cousin Stickles had\r\nbegun to sob.\r\n\r\n“Is there _one_ day in your life that you haven’t cried?” asked Valancy\r\ncuriously.\r\n\r\n“Valancy,” said Uncle James, being the first to recover the power of\r\nutterance, “did you mean what you said just now?”\r\n\r\n“I did.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to say that you have actually gone and\r\nmarried—_married_—that notorious Barney\r\nSnaith—that—that—criminal—that——”\r\n\r\n“I have.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Uncle James violently, “you are a shameless creature, lost\r\nto all sense of propriety and virtue, and I wash my hands entirely of\r\nyou. I do not want ever to see your face again.”\r\n\r\n“What have you left to say when I commit murder?” asked Valancy.\r\n\r\nUncle Benjamin again appealed to God to bless his soul.\r\n\r\n“That drunken outlaw—that——”\r\n\r\nA dangerous spark appeared in Valancy’s eyes. They might say what they\r\nliked to and of her but they should not abuse Barney.\r\n\r\n“Say ‘damn’ and you’ll feel better,” she suggested.\r\n\r\n“I can express my feelings without blasphemy. And I tell you you have\r\ncovered yourself with eternal disgrace and infamy by marrying that\r\ndrunkard——”\r\n\r\n“_You_ would be more endurable if you got drunk occasionally. Barney is\r\n_not_ a drunkard.”\r\n\r\n“He was seen drunk in Port Lawrence—pickled to the gills,” said Uncle\r\nBenjamin.\r\n\r\n“If that is true—and I don’t believe it—he had a good reason for it.\r\nNow I suggest that you all stop looking tragic and accept the\r\nsituation. I’m married—you can’t undo that. And I’m perfectly happy.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose we ought to be thankful he has really married her,” said\r\nCousin Sarah, by way of trying to look on the bright side.\r\n\r\n“If he really has,” said Uncle James, who had just washed his hands of\r\nValancy. “Who married you?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Towers, of Port Lawrence.”\r\n\r\n“By a Free Methodist!” groaned Mrs. Frederick—as if to have been\r\nmarried by an imprisoned Methodist would have been a shade less\r\ndisgraceful. It was the first thing she had said. Mrs. Frederick didn’t\r\nknow _what_ to say. The whole thing was too horrible—too nightmarish.\r\nShe was sure she must wake up soon. After all their bright hopes at the\r\nfuneral!\r\n\r\n“It makes me think of those what-d’ye-call-’ems,” said Uncle Benjamin\r\nhelplessly. “Those yarns—you know—of fairies taking babies out of their\r\ncradles.”\r\n\r\n“Valancy could hardly be a changeling at twenty-nine,” said Aunt\r\nWellington satirically.\r\n\r\n“She was the oddest-looking baby I ever saw, anyway,” averred Uncle\r\nBenjamin. “I said so at the time—you remember, Amelia? I said I had\r\nnever seen such eyes in a human head.”\r\n\r\n“I’m glad _I_ never had any children,” said Cousin Sarah. “If they\r\ndon’t break your heart in one way they do it in another.”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t it better to have your heart broken than to have it wither up?”\r\nqueried Valancy. “Before it could be broken it must have felt something\r\nsplendid. _That_ would be worth the pain.”\r\n\r\n“Dippy—clean dippy,” muttered Uncle Benjamin, with a vague,\r\nunsatisfactory feeling that somebody had said something like that\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n“Valancy,” said Mrs. Frederick solemnly, “do you ever pray to be\r\nforgiven for disobeying your mother?”\r\n\r\n“I _should_ pray to be forgiven for obeying you so long,” said Valancy\r\nstubbornly. “But I don’t pray about that at all. I just thank God every\r\nday for my happiness.”\r\n\r\n“I would rather,” said Mrs. Frederick, beginning to cry rather\r\nbelatedly, “see you dead before me than listen to what you have told me\r\ntoday.”\r\n\r\nValancy looked at her mother and aunts, and wondered if they could ever\r\nhave known anything of the real meaning of love. She felt sorrier for\r\nthem than ever. They were so very pitiable. And they never suspected\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“Barney Snaith is a scoundrel to have deluded you into marrying him,”\r\nsaid Uncle James violently.\r\n\r\n“Oh, _I_ did the deluding. I asked _him_ to marry me,” said Valancy,\r\nwith a wicked smile.\r\n\r\n“Have you _no_ pride?” demanded Aunt Wellington.\r\n\r\n“Lots of it. I am proud that I have achieved a husband by my own\r\nunaided efforts. Cousin Georgiana here wanted to help me to Edward\r\nBeck.”\r\n\r\n“Edward Beck is worth twenty thousand dollars and has the finest house\r\nbetween here and Port Lawrence,” said Uncle Benjamin.\r\n\r\n“That sounds very fine,” said Valancy scornfully, “but it isn’t worth\r\n_that_”—she snapped her fingers—“compared to feeling Barney’s arms\r\naround me and his cheek against mine.”\r\n\r\n“_Oh_, Doss!” said Cousin Stickles. Cousin Sarah said, “Oh, _Doss_!”\r\nAunt Wellington said, “Valancy, you need not be indecent.”\r\n\r\n“Why, it surely isn’t indecent to like to have your husband put his arm\r\naround you? I should think it would be indecent if you didn’t.”\r\n\r\n“Why expect decency from her?” inquired Uncle James sarcastically. “She\r\nhas cut herself off from decency forevermore. She has made her bed. Let\r\nher lie on it.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks,” said Valancy very gratefully. “How you would have enjoyed\r\nbeing Torquemada! Now, I must really be getting back. Mother, may I\r\nhave those three woollen cushions I worked last winter?”\r\n\r\n“Take them—take everything!” said Mrs. Frederick.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t want everything—or much. I don’t want my Blue Castle\r\ncluttered. Just the cushions. I’ll call for them some day when we motor\r\nin.”\r\n\r\nValancy rose and went to the door. There she turned. She was sorrier\r\nthan ever for them all. _They_ had no Blue Castle in the purple\r\nsolitudes of Mistawis.\r\n\r\n“The trouble with you people is that you don’t laugh enough,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Doss, dear,” said Cousin Georgiana mournfully, “some day you will\r\ndiscover that blood is thicker than water.”\r\n\r\n“Of course it is. But who wants water to be thick?” parried Valancy.\r\n“We want water to be thin—sparkling—crystal-clear.”\r\n\r\nCousin Stickles groaned.\r\n\r\nValancy would not ask any of them to come and see her—she was afraid\r\nthey _would_ come out of curiosity. But she said:\r\n\r\n“Do you mind if I drop in and see you once in a while, Mother?”\r\n\r\n“My house will always be open to you,” said Mrs. Frederick, with a\r\nmournful dignity.\r\n\r\n“You should never recognise her again,” said Uncle James sternly, as\r\nthe door closed behind Valancy.\r\n\r\n“I cannot quite forget that I am a mother,” said Mrs. Frederick. “My\r\npoor, unfortunate girl!”\r\n\r\n“I dare say the marriage isn’t legal,” said Uncle James comfortingly.\r\n“He has probably been married half a dozen times before. But _I_ am\r\nthrough with her. I have done all I could, Amelia. I think you will\r\nadmit that. Henceforth”—Uncle James was terribly solemn about\r\nit—“Valancy is to me as one dead.”\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Barney Snaith,” said Cousin Georgiana, as if trying it out to see\r\nhow it would sound.\r\n\r\n“He has a score of aliases, no doubt,” said Uncle Benjamin. “For my\r\npart, I believe the man is half Indian. I haven’t a doubt they’re\r\nliving in a wigwam.”\r\n\r\n“If he has married her under the name of Snaith and it isn’t his real\r\nname wouldn’t that make the marriage null and void?” asked Cousin\r\nStickles hopefully.\r\n\r\nUncle James shook his head.\r\n\r\n“No, it is the man who marries, not the name.”\r\n\r\n“You know,” said Cousin Gladys, who had recovered and returned but was\r\nstill shaky, “I had a distinct premonition of this at Herbert’s silver\r\ndinner. I remarked it at the time. When she was defending Snaith. You\r\nremember, of course. It came over me like a revelation. I spoke to\r\nDavid when I went home about it.”\r\n\r\n“What—_what_,” demanded Aunt Wellington of the universe, “has come over\r\nValancy? _Valancy!_”\r\n\r\nThe universe did not answer but Uncle James did.\r\n\r\n“Isn’t there something coming up of late about secondary personalities\r\ncropping out? I don’t hold with many of those new-fangled notions, but\r\nthere may be something in this one. It would account for her\r\nincomprehensible conduct.”\r\n\r\n“Valancy is so fond of mushrooms,” sighed Cousin Georgiana. “I’m afraid\r\nshe’ll get poisoned eating toadstools by mistake living up back in the\r\nwoods.”\r\n\r\n“There are worse things than death,” said Uncle James, believing that\r\nit was the first time in the world that such a statement had been made.\r\n\r\n“Nothing can ever be the same again!” sobbed Cousin Stickles.\r\n\r\nValancy, hurrying along the dusty road, back to cool Mistawis and her\r\npurple island, had forgotten all about them—just as she had forgotten\r\nthat she might drop dead at any moment if she hurried."

      "title": "CHAPTER XXVIII",
      "content": "Summer passed by. The Stirling clan—with the insignificant exception of\r\nCousin Georgiana—had tacitly agreed to follow Uncle James’ example and\r\nlook upon Valancy as one dead. To be sure, Valancy had an unquiet,\r\nghostly habit of recurring resurrections when she and Barney clattered\r\nthrough Deerwood and out to the Port in that unspeakable car. Valancy,\r\nbareheaded, with stars in her eyes. Barney, bareheaded, smoking his\r\npipe. But shaved. Always shaved now, if any of them had noticed it.\r\nThey even had the audacity to go in to Uncle Benjamin’s store to buy\r\ngroceries. Twice Uncle Benjamin ignored them. Was not Valancy one of\r\nthe dead? While Snaith had never existed. But the third time he told\r\nBarney he was a scoundrel who should be hung for luring an unfortunate,\r\nweak-minded girl away from her home and friends.\r\n\r\nBarney’s one straight eyebrow went up.\r\n\r\n“I have made her happy,” he said coolly, “and she was miserable with\r\nher friends. So that’s that.”\r\n\r\nUncle Benjamin stared. It had never occurred to him that women had to\r\nbe, or ought to be, “made happy.”\r\n\r\n“You—you pup!” he said.\r\n\r\n“Why be so unoriginal?” queried Barney amiably. “Anybody could call me\r\na pup. Why not think of something worthy of the Stirlings? Besides, I’m\r\nnot a pup. I’m really quite a middle-aged dog. Thirty-five, if you’re\r\ninterested in knowing.”\r\n\r\nUncle Benjamin remembered just in time that Valancy was dead. He turned\r\nhis back on Barney.\r\n\r\nValancy _was_ happy—gloriously and entirely so. She seemed to be living\r\nin a wonderful house of life and every day opened a new, mysterious\r\nroom. It was in a world which had nothing in common with the one she\r\nhad left behind—a world where time was not—which was young with\r\nimmortal youth—where there was neither past nor future but only the\r\npresent. She surrendered herself utterly to the charm of it.\r\n\r\nThe absolute freedom of it all was unbelievable. They could do exactly\r\nas they liked. No Mrs. Grundy. No traditions. No relatives. Or in-laws.\r\n“Peace, perfect peace, with loved ones far away,” as Barney quoted\r\nshamelessly.\r\n\r\nValancy had gone home once and got her cushions. And Cousin Georgiana\r\nhad given her one of her famous candlewick spreads of most elaborate\r\ndesign. “For your spare-room bed, dear,” she said.\r\n\r\n“But I haven’t got any spare-room,” said Valancy.\r\n\r\nCousin Georgiana looked horrified. A house without a spare-room was\r\nmonstrous to her.\r\n\r\n“But it’s a lovely spread,” said Valancy, with a kiss, “and I’m so glad\r\nto have it. I’ll put it on my own bed. Barney’s old patch-work quilt is\r\ngetting ragged.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see how you can be contented to live up back,” sighed Cousin\r\nGeorgiana. “It’s so out of the world.”\r\n\r\n“Contented!” Valancy laughed. What was the use of trying to explain to\r\nCousin Georgiana. “It is,” she agreed, “most gloriously and entirely\r\nout of the world.”\r\n\r\n“And you are really happy, dear?” asked Cousin Georgiana wistfully.\r\n\r\n“I really am,” said Valancy gravely, her eyes dancing.\r\n\r\n“Marriage is such a serious thing,” sighed Cousin Georgiana.\r\n\r\n“When it’s going to last long,” agreed Valancy.\r\n\r\nCousin Georgiana did not understand this at all. But it worried her and\r\nshe lay awake at nights wondering what Valancy meant by it.\r\n\r\nValancy loved her Blue Castle and was completely satisfied with it. The\r\nbig living-room had three windows, all commanding exquisite views of\r\nexquisite Mistawis. The one in the end of the room was an oriel\r\nwindow—which Tom MacMurray, Barney explained, had got out of some\r\nlittle, old “up back” church that had been sold. It faced the west and\r\nwhen the sunsets flooded it Valancy’s whole being knelt in prayer as if\r\nin some great cathedral. The new moons always looked down through it,\r\nthe lower pine boughs swayed about the top of it, and all through the\r\nnights the soft, dim silver of the lake dreamed through it.\r\n\r\nThere was a stone fireplace on the other side. No desecrating gas\r\nimitation but a real fireplace where you could burn real logs. With a\r\nbig grizzly bearskin on the floor before it, and beside it a hideous,\r\nred-plush sofa of Tom MacMurray’s régime. But its ugliness was hidden\r\nby silver-grey timber wolf skins, and Valancy’s cushions made it gay\r\nand comfortable. In a corner a nice, tall, lazy old clock ticked—the\r\nright kind of a clock. One that did not hurry the hours away but ticked\r\nthem off deliberately. It was the jolliest looking old clock. A fat,\r\ncorpulent clock with a great, round, man’s face painted on it, the\r\nhands stretching out of its nose and the hours encircling it like a\r\nhalo.\r\n\r\nThere was a big glass case of stuffed owls and several deer\r\nheads—likewise of Tom MacMurray’s vintage. Some comfortable old chairs\r\nthat asked to be sat upon. A squat little chair with a cushion was\r\nprescriptively Banjo’s. If anybody else dared sit on it Banjo glared\r\nhim out of it with his topaz-hued, black-ringed eyes. Banjo had an\r\nadorable habit of hanging over the back of it, trying to catch his own\r\ntail. Losing his temper because he couldn’t catch it. Giving it a\r\nfierce bite for spite when he _did_ catch it. Yowling malignantly with\r\npain. Barney and Valancy laughed at him until they ached. But it was\r\nGood Luck they loved. They were both agreed that Good Luck was so\r\nlovable that he practically amounted to an obsession.\r\n\r\nOne side of the wall was lined with rough, homemade book-shelves filled\r\nwith books, and between the two side windows hung an old mirror in a\r\nfaded gilt frame, with fat cupids gamboling in the panel over the\r\nglass. A mirror, Valancy thought, that must be like the fabled mirror\r\ninto which Venus had once looked and which thereafter reflected as\r\nbeautiful every woman who looked into it. Valancy thought she was\r\nalmost pretty in that mirror. But that may have been because she had\r\nshingled her hair.\r\n\r\nThis was before the day of bobs and was regarded as a wild, unheard-of\r\nproceeding—unless you had typhoid. When Mrs. Frederick heard of it she\r\nalmost decided to erase Valancy’s name from the family Bible. Barney\r\ncut the hair, square off at the back of Valancy’s neck, bringing it\r\ndown in a short black fringe over her forehead. It gave a meaning and a\r\npurpose to her little, three-cornered face that it never had possessed\r\nbefore. Even her nose ceased to irritate her. Her eyes were bright, and\r\nher sallow skin had cleared to the hue of creamy ivory. The old family\r\njoke had come true—she was really fat at last—anyway, no longer skinny.\r\nValancy might never be beautiful, but she was of the type that looks\r\nits best in the woods—elfin—mocking—alluring.\r\n\r\nHer heart bothered her very little. When an attack threatened she was\r\ngenerally able to head it off with Dr. Trent’s prescription. The only\r\nbad one she had was one night when she was temporarily out of medicine.\r\nAnd it _was_ a bad one. For the time being, Valancy realised keenly\r\nthat death was actually waiting to pounce on her any moment. But the\r\nrest of the time she would not—did not—let herself remember it at all."

      "content": "Valancy toiled not, neither did she spin. There was really very little\r\nwork to do. She cooked their meals on a coal-oil stove, performing all\r\nher little domestic rites carefully and exultingly, and they ate out on\r\nthe verandah that almost overhung the lake. Before them lay Mistawis,\r\nlike a scene out of some fairy tale of old time. And Barney smiling his\r\ntwisted, enigmatical smile at her across the table.\r\n\r\n“What a view old Tom picked out when he built this shack!” Barney would\r\nsay exultantly.\r\n\r\nSupper was the meal Valancy liked best. The faint laughter of winds was\r\nalways about them and the colours of Mistawis, imperial and spiritual,\r\nunder the changing clouds were something that cannot be expressed in\r\nmere words. Shadows, too. Clustering in the pines until a wind shook\r\nthem out and pursued them over Mistawis. They lay all day along the\r\nshores, threaded by ferns and wild blossoms. They stole around the\r\nheadlands in the glow of the sunset, until twilight wove them all into\r\none great web of dusk.\r\n\r\nThe cats, with their wise, innocent little faces, would sit on the\r\nverandah railing and eat the tidbits Barney flung them. And how good\r\neverything tasted! Valancy, amid all the romance of Mistawis, never\r\nforgot that men had stomachs. Barney paid her no end of compliments on\r\nher cooking.\r\n\r\n“After all,” he admitted, “there’s something to be said for square\r\nmeals. I’ve mostly got along by boiling two or three dozen eggs hard at\r\nonce and eating a few when I got hungry, with a slice of bacon once in\r\na while and a jorum of tea.”\r\n\r\nValancy poured tea out of Barney’s little battered old pewter teapot of\r\nincredible age. She had not even a set of dishes—only Barney’s\r\nmismatched chipped bits—and a dear, big, pobby old jug of robin’s-egg\r\nblue.\r\n\r\nAfter the meal was over they would sit there and talk for hours—or sit\r\nand say nothing, in all the languages of the world, Barney pulling away\r\nat his pipe, Valancy dreaming idly and deliciously, gazing at the\r\nfar-off hills beyond Mistawis where the spires of firs came out against\r\nthe sunset. The moonlight would begin to silver the Mistawis dusk. Bats\r\nwould begin to swoop darkly against the pale, western gold. The little\r\nwaterfall that came down on the high bank not far away would, by some\r\nwhim of the wildwood gods, begin to look like a wonderful white woman\r\nbeckoning through the spicy, fragrant evergreens. And Leander would\r\nbegin to chuckle diabolically on the mainland shore. How sweet it was\r\nto sit there and do nothing in the beautiful silence, with Barney at\r\nthe other side of the table, smoking!\r\n\r\nThere were plenty of other islands in sight, though none were near\r\nenough to be troublesome as neighbours. There was one little group of\r\nislets far off to the west which they called the Fortunate Isles. At\r\nsunrise they looked like a cluster of emeralds, at sunset like a\r\ncluster of amethysts. They were too small for houses; but the lights on\r\nthe larger islands would bloom out all over the lake, and bonfires\r\nwould be lighted on their shores, streaming up into the wood shadows\r\nand throwing great, blood-red ribbons over the waters. Music would\r\ndrift to them alluringly from boats here and there, or from the\r\nverandahs on the big house of the millionaire on the biggest island.\r\n\r\n“Would you like a house like that, Moonlight?” Barney asked once,\r\nwaving his hand at it. He had taken to calling her Moonlight, and\r\nValancy loved it.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Valancy, who had once dreamed of a mountain castle ten times\r\nthe size of the rich man’s “cottage” and now pitied the poor\r\ninhabitants of palaces. “No. It’s too elegant. I would have to carry it\r\nwith me everywhere I went. On my back like a snail. It would own\r\nme—possess me, body and soul. I like a house I can love and cuddle and\r\nboss. Just like ours here. I don’t envy Hamilton Gossard ‘the finest\r\nsummer residence in Canada.’ It is magnificent, but it isn’t my Blue\r\nCastle.”\r\n\r\nAway down at the far end of the lake they got every night a glimpse of\r\na big, continental train rushing through a clearing. Valancy liked to\r\nwatch its lighted windows flash by and wonder who was on it and what\r\nhopes and fears it carried. She also amused herself by picturing Barney\r\nand herself going to the dances and dinners in the houses on the\r\nislands, but she did not want to go in reality. Once they did go to a\r\nmasquerade dance in the pavilion at one of the hotels up the lake, and\r\nhad a glorious evening, but slipped away in their canoe, before\r\nunmasking time, back to the Blue Castle.\r\n\r\n“It was lovely—but I don’t want to go again,” said Valancy.\r\n\r\nSo many hours a day Barney shut himself up in Bluebeard’s Chamber.\r\nValancy never saw the inside of it. From the smells that filtered\r\nthrough at times she concluded he must be conducting chemical\r\nexperiments—or counterfeiting money. Valancy supposed there must be\r\nsmelly processes in making counterfeit money. But she did not trouble\r\nherself about it. She had no desire to peer into the locked chambers of\r\nBarney’s house of life. His past and his future concerned her not. Only\r\nthis rapturous present. Nothing else mattered.\r\n\r\nOnce he went away and stayed away two days and nights. He had asked\r\nValancy if she would be afraid to stay alone and she had said she would\r\nnot. He never told her where he had been. She was not afraid to be\r\nalone, but she was horribly lonely. The sweetest sound she had ever\r\nheard was Lady Jane’s clatter through the woods when Barney returned.\r\nAnd then his signal whistle from the shore. She ran down to the landing\r\nrock to greet him—to nestle herself into his eager arms—they _did_ seem\r\neager.\r\n\r\n“Have you missed me, Moonlight?” Barney was whispering.\r\n\r\n“It seems a hundred years since you went away,” said Valancy.\r\n\r\n“I won’t leave you again.”\r\n\r\n“You must,” protested Valancy, “if you want to. I’d be miserable if I\r\nthought you wanted to go and didn’t, because of me. I want you to feel\r\nperfectly free.”\r\n\r\nBarney laughed—a little cynically.\r\n\r\n“There is no such thing as freedom on earth,” he said. “Only different\r\nkinds of bondages. And comparative bondages. _You_ think you are free\r\nnow because you’ve escaped from a peculiarly unbearable kind of\r\nbondage. But are you? You love me—_that’s_ a bondage.”\r\n\r\n“Who said or wrote that ‘the prison unto which we doom ourselves no\r\nprison is’?” asked Valancy dreamily, clinging to his arm as they\r\nclimbed up the rock steps.\r\n\r\n“Ah, now you have it,” said Barney. “That’s all the freedom we can hope\r\nfor—the freedom to choose our prison. But, Moonlight,”—he stopped at\r\nthe door of the Blue Castle and looked about him—at the glorious lake,\r\nthe great, shadowy woods, the bonfires, the twinkling\r\nlights—“Moonlight, I’m glad to be home again. When I came down through\r\nthe woods and saw my home lights—mine—gleaming out under the old\r\npines—something I’d never seen before—oh, girl, I was glad—glad!”\r\n\r\nBut in spite of Barney’s doctrine of bondage, Valancy thought they were\r\nsplendidly free. It was amazing to be able to sit up half the night and\r\nlook at the moon if you wanted to. To be late for meals if you wanted\r\nto—she who had always been rebuked so sharply by her mother and so\r\nreproachfully by Cousin Stickles if she were one minute late. Dawdle\r\nover meals as long as you wanted to. Leave your crusts if you wanted\r\nto. Not come home at all for meals if you wanted to. Sit on a sun-warm\r\nrock and paddle your bare feet in the hot sand if you wanted to. Just\r\nsit and do nothing in the beautiful silence if you wanted to. In short,\r\ndo any fool thing you wanted to whenever the notion took you. If _that_\r\nwasn’t freedom, what was?"

      "content": "They didn’t spend all their days on the island. They spent more than\r\nhalf of them wandering at will through the enchanted Muskoka country.\r\nBarney knew the woods as a book and he taught their lore and craft to\r\nValancy. He could always find trail and haunt of the shy wood people.\r\nValancy learned the different fairy-likenesses of the mosses—the charm\r\nand exquisiteness of woodland blossoms. She learned to know every bird\r\nat sight and mimic its call—though never so perfectly as Barney. She\r\nmade friends with every kind of tree. She learned to paddle a canoe as\r\nwell as Barney himself. She liked to be out in the rain and she never\r\ncaught cold.\r\n\r\nSometimes they took a lunch with them and went berrying—strawberries\r\nand blueberries. How pretty blueberries were—the dainty green of the\r\nunripe berries, the glossy pinks and scarlets of the half ripes, the\r\nmisty blue of the fully matured! And Valancy learned the real flavour\r\nof the strawberry in its highest perfection. There was a certain sunlit\r\ndell on the banks of Mistawis along which white birches grew on one\r\nside and on the other still, changeless ranks of young spruces. There\r\nwere long grasses at the roots of the birches, combed down by the winds\r\nand wet with morning dew late into the afternoons. Here they found\r\nberries that might have graced the banquets of Lucullus, great\r\nambrosial sweetnesses hanging like rubies to long, rosy stalks. They\r\nlifted them by the stalk and ate them from it, uncrushed and virgin,\r\ntasting each berry by itself with all its wild fragrance ensphered\r\ntherein. When Valancy carried any of these berries home that elusive\r\nessence escaped and they became nothing more than the common berries of\r\nthe market-place—very kitchenly good indeed, but not as they would have\r\nbeen, eaten in their birch dell until her fingers were stained as pink\r\nas Aurora’s eyelids.\r\n\r\nOr they went after water-lilies. Barney knew where to find them in the\r\ncreeks and bays of Mistawis. Then the Blue Castle was glorious with\r\nthem, every receptacle that Valancy could contrive filled with the\r\nexquisite things. If not water lilies then cardinal flowers, fresh and\r\nvivid from the swamps of Mistawis, where they burned like ribbons of\r\nflame.\r\n\r\nSometimes they went trouting on little nameless rivers or hidden brooks\r\non whose banks Naiads might have sunned their white, wet limbs. Then\r\nall they took with them were some raw potatoes and salt. They roasted\r\nthe potatoes over a fire and Barney showed Valancy how to cook the\r\ntrout by wrapping them in leaves, coating them with mud and baking them\r\nin a bed of hot coals. Never were such delicious meals. Valancy had\r\nsuch an appetite it was no wonder she put flesh on her bones.\r\n\r\nOr they just prowled and explored through woods that always seemed to\r\nbe expecting something wonderful to happen. At least, that was the way\r\nValancy felt about them. Down the next hollow—over the next hill—you\r\nwould find it.\r\n\r\n“We don’t know where we’re going, but isn’t it fun to go?” Barney used\r\nto say.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice night overtook them, too far from their Blue Castle to\r\nget back. But Barney made a fragrant bed of bracken and fir boughs and\r\nthey slept on it dreamlessly, under a ceiling of old spruces with moss\r\nhanging from them, while beyond them moonlight and the murmur of pines\r\nblended together so that one could hardly tell which was light and\r\nwhich was sound.\r\n\r\nThere were rainy days, of course, when Muskoka was a wet green land.\r\nDays when showers drifted across Mistawis like pale ghosts of rain and\r\nthey never thought of staying in because of it. Days when it rained in\r\nright good earnest and they had to stay in. Then Barney shut himself up\r\nin Bluebeard’s Chamber and Valancy read, or dreamed on the wolfskins\r\nwith Good Luck purring beside her and Banjo watching them suspiciously\r\nfrom his own peculiar chair. On Sunday evenings they paddled across to\r\na point of land and walked from there through the woods to the little\r\nFree Methodist church. One felt really too happy for Sunday. Valancy\r\nhad never really liked Sundays before.\r\n\r\nAnd always, Sundays and weekdays, she was with Barney. Nothing else\r\nreally mattered. And what a companion he was! How understanding! How\r\njolly! How—how Barney-like! That summed it all up.\r\n\r\nValancy had taken some of her two hundred dollars out of the bank and\r\nspent it in pretty clothes. She had a little smoke-blue chiffon which\r\nshe always put on when they spent the evening at home—smoke-blue with\r\ntouches of silver about it. It was after she began wearing it that\r\nBarney began calling her Moonlight.\r\n\r\n“Moonlight and blue twilight—that is what you look like in that dress.\r\nI like it. It belongs to you. You aren’t exactly pretty, but you have\r\nsome adorable beauty-spots. Your eyes. And that little kissable dent\r\njust between your collar bones. You have the wrist and ankle of an\r\naristocrat. That little head of yours is beautifully shaped. And when\r\nyou look backward over your shoulder you’re maddening—especially in\r\ntwilight or moonlight. An elf maiden. A wood sprite. You belong to the\r\nwoods, Moonlight—you should never be out of them. In spite of your\r\nancestry, there is something wild and remote and untamed about you. And\r\nyou have such a nice, sweet, throaty, summery voice. Such a nice voice\r\nfor love-making.”\r\n\r\n“Shure an’ ye’ve kissed the Blarney Stone,” scoffed Valancy. But she\r\ntasted these compliments for weeks.\r\n\r\nShe got a pale green bathing-suit, too—a garment which would have given\r\nher clan their deaths if they had ever seen her in it. Barney taught\r\nher how to swim. Sometimes she put her bathing-dress on when she got up\r\nand didn’t take it off until she went to bed—running down to the water\r\nfor a plunge whenever she felt like it and sprawling on the sun-warm\r\nrocks to dry.\r\n\r\nShe had forgotten all the old humiliating things that used to come up\r\nagainst her in the night—the injustices and the disappointments. It was\r\nas if they had all happened to some other person—not to her, Valancy\r\nSnaith, who had always been happy.\r\n\r\n“I understand now what it means to be born again,” she told Barney.\r\n\r\nHolmes speaks of grief “staining backward” through the pages of life;\r\nbut Valancy found her happiness had stained backward likewise and\r\nflooded with rose-colour her whole previous drab existence. She found\r\nit hard to believe that she had ever been lonely and unhappy and\r\nafraid.\r\n\r\n“When death comes, I shall have lived,” thought Valancy. “I shall have\r\nhad my hour.”\r\n\r\nAnd her dust-pile!\r\n\r\nOne day Valancy had heaped up the sand in the little island cove in a\r\ntremendous cone and stuck a gay little Union Jack on top of it.\r\n\r\n“What are you celebrating?” Barney wanted to know.\r\n\r\n“I’m just exorcising an old demon,” Valancy told him."

      "title": "CHAPTER XXXI",
      "content": "Autumn came. Late September with cool nights. They had to forsake the\r\nverandah; but they kindled a fire in the big fireplace and sat before\r\nit with jest and laughter. They left the doors open, and Banjo and Good\r\nLuck came and went at pleasure. Sometimes they sat gravely on the\r\nbearskin rug between Barney and Valancy; sometimes they slunk off into\r\nthe mystery of the chill night outside. The stars smouldered in the\r\nhorizon mists through the old oriel. The haunting, persistent croon of\r\nthe pine-trees filled the air. The little waves began to make soft,\r\nsobbing splashes on the rocks below them in the rising winds. They\r\nneeded no light but the firelight that sometimes leaped up and revealed\r\nthem—sometimes shrouded them in shadow. When the night wind rose higher\r\nBarney would shut the door and light a lamp and read to her—poetry and\r\nessays and gorgeous, dim chronicles of ancient wars. Barney never would\r\nread novels: he vowed they bored him. But sometimes she read them\r\nherself, curled up on the wolf skins, laughing aloud in peace. For\r\nBarney was not one of those aggravating people who can never hear you\r\nsmiling audibly over something you’ve read without inquiring placidly,\r\n“What is the joke?”\r\n\r\nOctober—with a gorgeous pageant of color around Mistawis, into which\r\nValancy plunged her soul. Never had she imagined anything so splendid.\r\nA great, tinted peace. Blue, wind-winnowed skies. Sunlight sleeping in\r\nthe glades of that fairyland. Long dreamy purple days paddling idly in\r\ntheir canoe along shores and up the rivers of crimson and gold. A\r\nsleepy, red hunter’s moon. Enchanted tempests that stripped the leaves\r\nfrom the trees and heaped them along the shores. Flying shadows of\r\nclouds. What had all the smug, opulent lands out front to compare with\r\nthis?\r\n\r\nNovember—with uncanny witchery in its changed trees. With murky red\r\nsunsets flaming in smoky crimson behind the westering hills. With dear\r\ndays when the austere woods were beautiful and gracious in a dignified\r\nserenity of folded hands and closed eyes—days full of a fine, pale\r\nsunshine that sifted through the late, leafless gold of the\r\njuniper-trees and glimmered among the grey beeches, lighting up\r\nevergreen banks of moss and washing the colonnades of the pines. Days\r\nwith a high-sprung sky of flawless turquoise. Days when an exquisite\r\nmelancholy seemed to hang over the landscape and dream about the lake.\r\nBut days, too, of the wild blackness of great autumn storms, followed\r\nby dank, wet, streaming nights when there was witch-laughter in the\r\npines and fitful moans among the mainland trees. What cared they? Old\r\nTom had built his roof well, and his chimney drew.\r\n\r\n“Warm fire—books—comfort—safety from storm—our cats on the rug.\r\nMoonlight,” said Barney, “would you be any happier now if you had a\r\nmillion dollars?”\r\n\r\n“No—nor half so happy. I’d be bored by conventions and obligations\r\nthen.”\r\n\r\nDecember. Early snows and Orion. The pale fires of the Milky Way. It\r\nwas really winter now—wonderful, cold, starry winter. How Valancy had\r\nalways hated winter! Dull, brief, uneventful days. Long, cold,\r\ncompanionless nights. Cousin Stickles with her back that had to be\r\nrubbed continually. Cousin Stickles making weird noises gargling her\r\nthroat in the mornings. Cousin Stickles whining over the price of coal.\r\nHer mother, probing, questioning, ignoring. Endless colds and\r\nbronchitis—or the dread of it. Redfern’s Liniment and Purple Pills.\r\n\r\nBut now she loved winter. Winter was beautiful “up back”—almost\r\nintolerably beautiful. Days of clear brilliance. Evenings that were\r\nlike cups of glamour—the purest vintage of winter’s wine. Nights with\r\ntheir fire of stars. Cold, exquisite winter sunrises. Lovely ferns of\r\nice all over the windows of the Blue Castle. Moonlight on birches in a\r\nsilver thaw. Ragged shadows on windy evenings—torn, twisted, fantastic\r\nshadows. Great silences, austere and searching. Jewelled, barbaric\r\nhills. The sun suddenly breaking through grey clouds over long, white\r\nMistawis. Icy-grey twilights, broken by snow-squalls, when their cosy\r\nliving-room, with its goblins of firelight and inscrutable cats seemed\r\ncosier than ever. Every hour brought a new revelation and wonder.\r\n\r\nBarney ran Lady Jane into Roaring Abel’s barn and taught Valancy how to\r\nsnowshoe—Valancy, who ought to be laid up with bronchitis. But Valancy\r\nhad not even a cold. Later on in the winter Barney had a terrible one\r\nand Valancy nursed him through it with a dread of pneumonia in her\r\nheart. But Valancy’s colds seemed to have gone where old moons go.\r\nWhich was luck—for she hadn’t even Redfern’s Liniment. She had\r\nthoughtfully bought a bottle at the Port and Barney had hurled it into\r\nfrozen Mistawis with a scowl.\r\n\r\n“Bring no more of that devilish stuff here,” he had ordered briefly. It\r\nwas the first and last time he had spoken harshly to her.\r\n\r\nThey went for long tramps through the exquisite reticence of winter\r\nwoods and the silver jungles of frosted trees, and found loveliness\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\nAt times they seemed to be walking through a spellbound world of\r\ncrystal and pearl, so white and radiant were clearings and lakes and\r\nsky. The air was so crisp and clear that it was half intoxicating.\r\n\r\nOnce they stood in a hesitation of ecstasy at the entrance of a narrow\r\npath between ranks of birches. Every twig and spray was outlined in\r\nsnow. The undergrowth along its sides was a little fairy forest cut out\r\nof marble. The shadows cast by the pale sunshine were fine and\r\nspiritual.\r\n\r\n“Come away,” said Barney, turning. “We must not commit the desecration\r\nof tramping through there.”\r\n\r\nOne evening they came upon a snowdrift far back in an old clearing\r\nwhich was in the exact likeness of a beautiful woman’s profile. Seen\r\ntoo close by, the resemblance was lost, as in the fairy-tale of the\r\nCastle of St. John. Seen from behind, it was a shapeless oddity. But at\r\njust the right distance and angle the outline was so perfect that when\r\nthey came suddenly upon it, gleaming out against the dark background of\r\nspruce in the glow of that winter sunset they both exclaimed in\r\namazement. There was a low, noble brow, a straight, classic nose, lips\r\nand chin and cheek-curve modelled as if some goddess of old time had\r\nsat to the sculptor, and a breast of such cold, swelling purity as the\r\nvery spirit of the winter woods might display.\r\n\r\n“‘All the beauty that old Greece and Rome, sung painted, taught,’”\r\nquoted Barney.\r\n\r\n“And to think no human eyes save ours have seen or will see it,”\r\nbreathed Valancy, who felt at times as if she were living in a book by\r\nJohn Foster. As she looked around her she recalled some passages she\r\nhad marked in the new Foster book Barney had brought her from the\r\nPort—with an adjuration not to expect _him_ to read or listen to it.\r\n\r\n“‘All the tintings of winter woods are extremely delicate and\r\nelusive,’” recalled Valancy. “‘When the brief afternoon wanes and the\r\nsun just touches the tops of the hills, there seems to be all over the\r\nwoods an abundance, not of colour, but of the spirit of colour. There\r\nis really nothing but pure white after all, but one has the impression\r\nof fairy-like blendings of rose and violet, opal and heliotrope on the\r\nslopes—in the dingles and along the curves of the forest-land. You feel\r\nsure the tint is there, but when you look at it directly it is gone.\r\nFrom the corner of your eye you are aware that it is lurking over\r\nyonder in a spot where there was nothing but pale purity a moment ago.\r\nOnly just when the sun is setting is there a fleeting moment of real\r\ncolour. Then the redness streams out over the snow and incarnadines the\r\nhills and rivers and smites the crest of the pines with flame. Just a\r\nfew minutes of transfiguration and revelation—and it is gone.’\r\n\r\n“I wonder if John Foster ever spent a winter in Mistawis,” said\r\nValancy.\r\n\r\n“Not likely,” scoffed Barney. “People who write tosh like that\r\ngenerally write it in a warm house on some smug city street.”\r\n\r\n“You are too hard on John Foster,” said Valancy severely. “No one could\r\nhave written that little paragraph I read you last night without having\r\nseen it first—you know he couldn’t.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t listen to it,” said Barney morosely. “You know I told you I\r\nwouldn’t.”\r\n\r\n“Then you’ve got to listen to it now,” persisted Valancy. She made him\r\nstand still on his snowshoes while she repeated it.\r\n\r\n“‘She is a rare artist, this old Mother Nature, who works “for the joy\r\nof working” and not in any spirit of vain show. Today the fir woods are\r\na symphony of greens and greys, so subtle that you cannot tell where\r\none shade begins to be the other. Grey trunk, green bough, grey-green\r\nmoss above the white, grey-shadowed floor. Yet the old gypsy doesn’t\r\nlike unrelieved monotones. She must have a dash of colour. See it. A\r\nbroken dead fir bough, of a beautiful red-brown, swinging among the\r\nbeards of moss.’”\r\n\r\n“Good Lord, do you learn all that fellow’s books by heart?” was\r\nBarney’s disgusted reaction as he strode off.\r\n\r\n“John Foster’s books were all that saved my soul alive the past five\r\nyears,” averred Valancy. “Oh, Barney, look at that exquisite filigree\r\nof snow in the furrows of that old elm-tree trunk.”\r\n\r\nWhen they came out to the lake they changed from snowshoes to skates\r\nand skated home. For a wonder Valancy had learned, when she was a\r\nlittle schoolgirl, to skate on the pond behind the Deerwood school. She\r\nnever had any skates of her own, but some of the other girls had lent\r\nher theirs and she seemed to have a natural knack of it. Uncle Benjamin\r\nhad once promised her a pair of skates for Christmas, but when\r\nChristmas came he had given her rubbers instead. She had never skated\r\nsince she grew up, but the old trick came back quickly, and glorious\r\nwere the hours she and Barney spent skimming over the white lakes and\r\npast the dark islands where the summer cottages were closed and silent.\r\nTonight they flew down Mistawis before the wind, in an exhilaration\r\nthat crimsoned Valancy’s cheeks under her white tam. And at the end was\r\nher dear little house, on the island of pines, with a coating of snow\r\non its roof, sparkling in the moonlight. Its windows glinted impishly\r\nat her in the stray gleams.\r\n\r\n“Looks exactly like a picture-book, doesn’t it?” said Barney.\r\n\r\nThey had a lovely Christmas. No rush. No scramble. No niggling attempts\r\nto make ends meet. No wild effort to remember whether she hadn’t given\r\nthe same kind of present to the same person two Christmases before—no\r\nmob of last-minute shoppers—no dreary family “reunions” where she sat\r\nmute and unimportant—no attacks of “nerves.” They decorated the Blue\r\nCastle with pine boughs, and Valancy made delightful little tinsel\r\nstars and hung them up amid the greenery. She cooked a dinner to which\r\nBarney did full justice, while Good Luck and Banjo picked the bones.\r\n\r\n“A land that can produce a goose like that is an admirable land,” vowed\r\nBarney. “Canada forever!” And they drank to the Union Jack a bottle of\r\ndandelion wine that Cousin Georgiana had given Valancy along with the\r\nbedspread.\r\n\r\n“One never knows,” Cousin Georgiana had said solemnly, “when one may\r\nneed a little stimulant.”\r\n\r\nBarney had asked Valancy what she wanted for a Christmas present.\r\n\r\n“Something frivolous and unnecessary,” said Valancy, who had got a pair\r\nof goloshes last Christmas and two long-sleeved, woolen undervests the\r\nyear before. And so on back.\r\n\r\nTo her delight, Barney gave her a necklace of pearl beads. Valancy had\r\nwanted a string of milky pearl beads—like congealed moonshine—all her\r\nlife. And these were so pretty. All that worried her was that they were\r\nreally too good. They must have cost a great deal—fifteen dollars, at\r\nleast. Could Barney afford that? She didn’t know a thing about his\r\nfinances. She had refused to let him buy any of her clothes—she had\r\nenough for that, she told him, as long as she would need clothes. In a\r\nround, black jar on the chimney-piece Barney put money for their\r\nhousehold expenses—always enough. The jar was never empty, though\r\nValancy never caught him replenishing it. He couldn’t have much, of\r\ncourse, and that necklace—but Valancy tossed care aside. She would wear\r\nit and enjoy it. It was the first pretty thing she had ever had."

      "content": "New Year. The old, shabby, inglorious outlived calendar came down. The\r\nnew one went up. January was a month of storms. It snowed for three\r\nweeks on end. The thermometer went miles below zero and stayed there.\r\nBut, as Barney and Valancy pointed out to each other, there were no\r\nmosquitoes. And the roar and crackle of their big fire drowned the\r\nhowls of the north wind. Good Luck and Banjo waxed fat and developed\r\nresplendent coats of thick, silky fur. Nip and Tuck had gone.\r\n\r\n“But they’ll come back in spring,” promised Barney.\r\n\r\nThere was no monotony. Sometimes they had dramatic little private spats\r\nthat never even thought of becoming quarrels. Sometimes Roaring Abel\r\ndropped in—for an evening or a whole day—with his old tartan cap and\r\nhis long red beard coated with snow. He generally brought his fiddle\r\nand played for them, to the delight of all except Banjo, who would go\r\ntemporarily insane and retreat under Valancy’s bed. Sometimes Abel and\r\nBarney talked while Valancy made candy for them; sometimes they sat and\r\nsmoked in silence _à la_ Tennyson and Carlyle, until the Blue Castle\r\nreeked and Valancy fled to the open. Sometimes they played checkers\r\nfiercely and silently the whole night through. Sometimes they all ate\r\nthe russet apples Abel had brought, while the jolly old clock ticked\r\nthe delightful minutes away.\r\n\r\n“A plate of apples, an open fire, and ‘a jolly goode booke whereon to\r\nlooke’ are a fair substitute for heaven,” vowed Barney. “Any one can\r\nhave the streets of gold. Let’s have another whack at Carman.”\r\n\r\nIt was easier now for the Stirlings to believe Valancy of the dead. Not\r\neven dim rumours of her having been over at the Port came to trouble\r\nthem, though she and Barney used to skate there occasionally to see a\r\nmovie and eat hot dogs shamelessly at the corner stand afterwards.\r\nPresumably none of the Stirlings ever thought about her—except Cousin\r\nGeorgiana, who used to lie awake worrying about poor Doss. Did she have\r\nenough to eat? Was that dreadful creature good to her? Was she warm\r\nenough at nights?\r\n\r\nValancy was quite warm at nights. She used to wake up and revel\r\nsilently in the cosiness of those winter nights on that little island\r\nin the frozen lake. The nights of other winters had been so cold and\r\nlong. Valancy hated to wake up in them and think about the bleakness\r\nand emptiness of the day that had passed and the bleakness and\r\nemptiness of the day that would come. Now she almost counted that\r\nnight lost on which she didn’t wake up and lie awake for half an hour\r\njust being happy, while Barney’s regular breathing went on beside her,\r\nand through the open door the smouldering brands in the fireplace\r\nwinked at her in the gloom. It was very nice to feel a little Lucky cat\r\njump up on your bed in the darkness and snuggle down at your feet,\r\npurring; but Banjo would be sitting dourly by himself out in front of\r\nthe fire like a brooding demon. At such moments Banjo was anything but\r\ncanny, but Valancy loved his uncanniness.\r\n\r\nThe side of the bed had to be right against the window. There was no\r\nother place for it in the tiny room. Valancy, lying there, could look\r\nout of the window, through the big pine boughs that actually touched\r\nit, away up Mistawis, white and lustrous as a pavement of pearl, or\r\ndark and terrible in the storm. Sometimes the pine boughs tapped\r\nagainst the panes with friendly signals. Sometimes she heard the little\r\nhissing whisper of snow against them right at her side. Some nights the\r\nwhole outer world seemed given over to the empery of silence; then came\r\nnights when there would be a majestic sweep of wind in the pines;\r\nnights of dear starlight when it whistled freakishly and joyously\r\naround the Blue Castle; brooding nights before storm when it crept\r\nalong the floor of the lake with a low, wailing cry of boding and\r\nmystery. Valancy wasted many perfectly good sleeping hours in these\r\ndelightful communings. But she could sleep as long in the morning as\r\nshe wanted to. Nobody cared. Barney cooked his own breakfast of bacon\r\nand eggs and then shut himself up in Bluebeard’s Chamber till supper\r\ntime. Then they had an evening of reading and talk. They talked about\r\neverything in this world and a good many things in other worlds. They\r\nlaughed over their own jokes until the Blue Castles re-echoed.\r\n\r\n“You _do_ laugh beautifully,” Barney told her once. “It makes me want\r\nto laugh just to hear you laugh. There’s a trick about your laugh—as if\r\nthere were so much more fun back of it that you wouldn’t let out. Did\r\nyou laugh like that before you came to Mistawis, Moonlight?”\r\n\r\n“I never laughed at all—really. I used to giggle foolishly when I felt\r\nI was expected to. But now—the laugh just comes.”\r\n\r\nIt struck Valancy more than once that Barney himself laughed a great\r\ndeal oftener than he used to and that his laugh had changed. It had\r\nbecome wholesome. She rarely heard the little cynical note in it now.\r\nCould a man laugh like that who had crimes on his conscience? Yet\r\nBarney _must_ have done something. Valancy had indifferently made up\r\nher mind as to what he had done. She concluded he was a defaulting bank\r\ncashier. She had found in one of Barney’s books an old clipping cut\r\nfrom a Montreal paper in which a vanished, defaulting cashier was\r\ndescribed. The description applied to Barney—as well as to half a dozen\r\nother men Valancy knew—and from some casual remarks he had dropped from\r\ntime to time she concluded he knew Montreal rather well. Valancy had it\r\nall figured out in the back of her mind. Barney had been in a bank. He\r\nwas tempted to take some money to speculate—meaning, of course, to put\r\nit back. He had got in deeper and deeper, until he found there was\r\nnothing for it but flight. It had happened so to scores of men. He had,\r\nValancy was absolutely certain, never meant to do wrong. Of course, the\r\nname of the man in the clipping was Bernard Craig. But Valancy had\r\nalways thought Snaith was an alias. Not that it mattered.\r\n\r\nValancy had only one unhappy night that winter. It came in late March\r\nwhen most of the snow had gone and Nip and Tuck had returned. Barney\r\nhad gone off in the afternoon for a long, woodland tramp, saying he\r\nwould be back by dark if all went well. Soon after he had gone it had\r\nbegun to snow. The wind rose and presently Mistawis was in the grip of\r\none of the worst storms of the winter. It tore up the lake and struck\r\nat the little house. The dark angry woods on the mainland scowled at\r\nValancy, menace in the toss of their boughs, threats in their windy\r\ngloom, terror in the roar of their hearts. The trees on the island\r\ncrouched in fear. Valancy spent the night huddled on the rug before the\r\nfire, her face buried in her hands, when she was not vainly peering\r\nfrom the oriel in a futile effort to see through the furious smoke of\r\nwind and snow that had once been blue-dimpled Mistawis. Where was\r\nBarney? Lost on the merciless lakes? Sinking exhausted in the drifts of\r\nthe pathless woods? Valancy died a hundred deaths that night and paid\r\nin full for all the happiness of her Blue Castle. When morning came the\r\nstorm broke and cleared; the sun shone gloriously over Mistawis; and at\r\nnoon Barney came home. Valancy saw him from the oriel as he came around\r\na wooded point, slender and black against the glistening white world.\r\nShe did not run to meet him. Something happened to her knees and she\r\ndropped down on Banjo’s chair. Luckily Banjo got out from under in\r\ntime, his whiskers bristling with indignation. Barney found her there,\r\nher head buried in her hands.\r\n\r\n“Barney, I thought you were dead,” she whispered.\r\n\r\nBarney hooted.\r\n\r\n“After two years of the Klondike did you think a baby storm like this\r\ncould get me? I spent the night in that old lumber shanty over by\r\nMuskoka. A bit cold but snug enough. Little goose! Your eyes look like\r\nburnt holes in a blanket. Did you sit up here all night worrying over\r\nan old woodsman like me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Valancy. “I—couldn’t help it. The storm seemed so wild.\r\nAnybody might have been lost in it. When—I saw you—come round the\r\npoint—there—something happened to me. I don’t know what. It was as if I\r\nhad died and come back to life. I can’t describe it any other way.”"

      "content": "Spring. Mistawis black and sullen for a week or two, then flaming in\r\nsapphire and turquoise, lilac and rose again, laughing through the\r\noriel, caressing its amethyst islands, rippling under winds soft as\r\nsilk. Frogs, little green wizards of swamp and pool, singing everywhere\r\nin the long twilights and long into the nights; islands fairy-like in a\r\ngreen haze; the evanescent beauty of wild young trees in early leaf;\r\nfrost-like loveliness of the new foliage of juniper-trees; the woods\r\nputting on a fashion of spring flowers, dainty, spiritual things akin\r\nto the soul of the wilderness; red mist on the maples; willows decked\r\nout with glossy silver pussies; all the forgotten violets of Mistawis\r\nblooming again; lure of April moons.\r\n\r\n“Think how many thousands of springs have been here on Mistawis—and all\r\nof them beautiful,” said Valancy. “Oh, Barney, look at that wild plum!\r\nI will—I must quote from John Foster. There’s a passage in one of his\r\nbooks—I’ve re-read it a hundred times. He must have written it before a\r\ntree just like that:\r\n\r\n“‘Behold the young wild plum-tree which has adorned herself after\r\nimmemorial fashion in a wedding-veil of fine lace. The fingers of wood\r\npixies must have woven it, for nothing like it ever came from an\r\nearthly loom. I vow the tree is conscious of its loveliness. It is\r\nbridling before our very eyes—as if its beauty were not the most\r\nephemeral thing in the woods, as it is the rarest and most exceeding,\r\nfor today it is and tomorrow it is not. Every south wind purring\r\nthrough the boughs will winnow away a shower of slender petals. But\r\nwhat matter? Today it is queen of the wild places and it is always\r\ntoday in the woods.’”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure you feel much better since you’ve got that out of your\r\nsystem,” said Barney heartlessly.\r\n\r\n“Here’s a patch of dandelions,” said Valancy, unsubdued. “Dandelions\r\nshouldn’t grow in the woods, though. They haven’t any sense of the\r\nfitness of things at all. They are too cheerful and self-satisfied.\r\nThey haven’t any of the mystery and reserve of the real wood-flowers.”\r\n\r\n“In short, they’ve no secrets,” said Barney. “But wait a bit. The woods\r\nwill have their own way even with those obvious dandelions. In a little\r\nwhile all that obtrusive yellowness and complacency will be gone and\r\nwe’ll find here misty, phantom-like globes hovering over those long\r\ngrasses in full harmony with the traditions of the forest.”\r\n\r\n“That sounds John Fosterish,” teased Valancy.\r\n\r\n“What have I done that deserved a slam like that?” complained Barney.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest signs of spring was the renaissance of Lady Jane.\r\nBarney put her on roads that no other car would look at, and they went\r\nthrough Deerwood in mud to the axles. They passed several Stirlings,\r\nwho groaned and reflected that now spring was come they would encounter\r\nthat shameless pair everywhere. Valancy, prowling about Deerwood shops,\r\nmet Uncle Benjamin on the street; but he did not realise until he had\r\ngone two blocks further on that the girl in the scarlet-collared\r\nblanket coat, with cheeks reddened in the sharp April air and the\r\nfringe of black hair over laughing, slanted eyes, was Valancy. When he\r\ndid realise it, Uncle Benjamin was indignant. What business had Valancy\r\nto look like—like—like a young girl? The way of the transgressor was\r\nhard. Had to be. Scriptural and proper. Yet Valancy’s path couldn’t be\r\nhard. She wouldn’t look like that if it were. There was something\r\nwrong. It was almost enough to make a man turn modernist.\r\n\r\nBarney and Valancy clanged on to the Port, so that it was dark when\r\nthey went through Deerwood again. At her old home Valancy, seized with\r\na sudden impulse, got out, opened the little gate and tiptoed around to\r\nthe sitting-room window. There sat her mother and Cousin Stickles\r\ndrearily, grimly knitting. Baffling and inhuman as ever. If they had\r\nlooked the least bit lonesome Valancy would have gone in. But they did\r\nnot. Valancy would not disturb them for worlds."

      "content": "Valancy had two wonderful moments that spring.\r\n\r\nOne day, coming home through the woods, with her arms full of trailing\r\narbutus and creeping spruce, she met a man who she knew must be Allan\r\nTierney. Allan Tierney, the celebrated painter of beautiful women. He\r\nlived in New York in winter, but he owned an island cottage at the\r\nnorthern end of Mistawis to which he always came the minute the ice was\r\nout of the lake. He was reputed to be a lonely, eccentric man. He never\r\nflattered his sitters. There was no need to, for he would not paint any\r\none who required flattery. To be painted by Allan Tierney was all the\r\n_cachet_ of beauty a woman could desire. Valancy had heard so much\r\nabout him that she couldn’t help turning her head back over her\r\nshoulder for another shy, curious look at him. A shaft of pale spring\r\nsunlight fell through a great pine athwart her bare black head and her\r\nslanted eyes. She wore a pale green sweater and had bound a fillet of\r\nlinnæa vine about her hair. The feathery fountain of trailing spruce\r\noverflowed her arms and fell around her. Allan Tierney’s eyes lighted\r\nup.\r\n\r\n“I’ve had a caller,” said Barney the next afternoon, when Valancy had\r\nreturned from another flower quest.\r\n\r\n“Who?” Valancy was surprised but indifferent. She began filling a\r\nbasket with arbutus.\r\n\r\n“Allan Tierney. He wants to paint you, Moonlight.”\r\n\r\n“Me!” Valancy dropped her basket and her arbutus. “You’re laughing at\r\nme, Barney.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not. That’s what Tierney came for. To ask my permission to paint\r\nmy wife—as the Spirit of Muskoka, or something like that.”\r\n\r\n“But—but—” stammered Valancy, “Allan Tierney never paints any but—any\r\nbut——”\r\n\r\n“Beautiful women,” finished Barney. “Conceded. Q. E. D., Mistress\r\nBarney Snaith is a beautiful woman.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense,” said Valancy, stooping to retrieve her arbutus. “You _know_\r\nthat’s nonsense, Barney. I know I’m a heap better-looking than I was a\r\nyear ago, but I’m not beautiful.”\r\n\r\n“Allan Tierney never makes a mistake,” said Barney. “You forget,\r\nMoonlight, that there are different kinds of beauty. Your imagination\r\nis obsessed by the very obvious type of your cousin Olive. Oh, I’ve\r\nseen her—she’s a stunner—but you’d never catch Allan Tierney wanting to\r\npaint her. In the horrible but expressive slang phrase, she keeps all\r\nher goods in the shop-window. But in your subconscious mind you have a\r\nconviction that nobody can be beautiful who doesn’t look like Olive.\r\nAlso, you remember your face as it was in the days when your soul was\r\nnot allowed to shine through it. Tierney said something about the curve\r\nof your cheek as you looked back over your shoulder. You know I’ve\r\noften told you it was distracting. And he’s quite batty about your\r\neyes. If I wasn’t absolutely sure it was solely professional—he’s\r\nreally a crabbed old bachelor, you know—I’d be jealous.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I don’t want to be painted,” said Valancy. “I hope you told him\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t tell him that. I didn’t know what _you_ wanted. But I told\r\nhim _I_ didn’t want my wife painted—hung up in a salon for the mob to\r\nstare at. Belonging to another man. For of course I couldn’t buy the\r\npicture. So even if you had wanted to be painted, Moonlight, your\r\ntyrannous husband would not have permitted it. Tierney was a bit\r\nsquiffy. He isn’t used to being turned down like that. His requests are\r\nalmost like royalty’s.”\r\n\r\n“But we are outlaws,” laughed Valancy. “We bow to no decrees—we\r\nacknowledge no sovereignty.”\r\n\r\nIn her heart she thought unashamedly:\r\n\r\n“I wish Olive could know that Allan Tierney wanted to paint me. _Me!_\r\nLittle-old-maid-Valancy-Stirling-that-was.”\r\n\r\nHer second wonder-moment came one evening in May. She realised that\r\nBarney actually liked her. She had always hoped he did, but sometimes\r\nshe had a little, disagreeable, haunting dread that he was just kind\r\nand nice and chummy out of pity; knowing that she hadn’t long to live\r\nand determined she should have a good time as long as she did live; but\r\naway back in his mind rather looking forward to freedom again, with no\r\nintrusive woman creature in his island fastness and no chattering thing\r\nbeside him in his woodland prowls. She knew he could never love her.\r\nShe did not even want him to. If he loved her he would be unhappy when\r\nshe died—Valancy never flinched from the plain word. No “passing away”\r\nfor her. And she did not want him to be the least unhappy. But neither\r\ndid she want him to be glad—or relieved. She wanted him to like her and\r\nmiss her as a good chum. But she had never been sure until this night\r\nthat he did.\r\n\r\nThey had walked over the hills in the sunset. They had the delight of\r\ndiscovering a virgin spring in a ferny hollow and had drunk together\r\nfrom it out of a birch-bark cup; they had come to an old tumble-down\r\nrail fence and sat on it for a long time. They didn’t talk much, but\r\nValancy had a curious sense of _oneness_. She knew that she couldn’t\r\nhave felt that if he hadn’t liked her.\r\n\r\n“You nice little thing,” said Barney suddenly. “Oh, you nice little\r\nthing! Sometimes I feel you’re too nice to be real—that I’m just\r\ndreaming you.”\r\n\r\n“Why can’t I die now—this very minute—when I am so happy!” thought\r\nValancy.\r\n\r\nWell, it couldn’t be so very long now. Somehow, Valancy had always felt\r\nshe would live out the year Dr. Trent had allotted. She had not been\r\ncareful—she had never tried to be. But, somehow, she had always counted\r\non living out her year. She had not let herself think about it at all.\r\nBut now, sitting here beside Barney, with her hand in his, a sudden\r\nrealisation came to her. She had not had a heart attack for a long\r\nwhile—two months at least. The last one she had had was two or three\r\nnights before Barney was out in the storm. Since then she had not\r\nremembered she had a heart. Well, no doubt, it betokened the nearness\r\nof the end. Nature had given up the struggle. There would be no more\r\npain.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid heaven will be very dull after this past year,” thought\r\nValancy. “But perhaps one will not remember. Would that be—nice? No,\r\nno. I don’t want to forget Barney. I’d rather be miserable in heaven\r\nremembering him than happy forgetting him. And I’ll always remember\r\nthrough all eternity—that he really, _really_ liked me.”"

      "content": "Thirty seconds can be very long sometimes. Long enough to work a\r\nmiracle or a revolution. In thirty seconds life changed wholly for\r\nBarney and Valancy Snaith.\r\n\r\nThey had gone around the lake one June evening in their disappearing\r\npropeller, fished for an hour in a little creek, left their boat there,\r\nand walked up through the woods to Port Lawrence two miles away.\r\nValancy prowled a bit in the shops and got herself a new pair of\r\nsensible shoes. Her old pair had suddenly and completely given out, and\r\nthis evening she had been compelled to put on the little fancy pair of\r\npatent-leather with rather high, slender heels, which she had bought in\r\na fit of folly one day in the winter because of their beauty and\r\nbecause she wanted to make one foolish, extravagant purchase in her\r\nlife. She sometimes put them on of an evening in the Blue Castle, but\r\nthis was the first time she had worn them outside. She had not found it\r\nany too easy walking up through the woods in them, and Barney guyed her\r\nunmercifully about them. But in spite of the inconvenience, Valancy\r\nsecretly rather liked the look of her trim ankles and high instep above\r\nthose pretty, foolish shoes and did not change them in the shop as she\r\nmight have done.\r\n\r\nThe sun was hanging low above the pines when they left Port Lawrence.\r\nTo the north of it the woods closed around the town quite suddenly.\r\nValancy always had a sense of stepping from one world to another—from\r\nreality to fairyland—when she went out of Port Lawrence and in a\r\ntwinkling found it shut off behind her by the armies of the pines.\r\n\r\nA mile and a half from Port Lawrence there was a small railroad station\r\nwith a little station-house which at this hour of the day was deserted,\r\nsince no local train was due. Not a soul was in sight when Barney and\r\nValancy emerged from the woods. Off to the left a sudden curve in the\r\ntrack hid it from view, but over the tree-tops beyond, the long plume\r\nof smoke betokened the approach of a through train. The rails were\r\nvibrating to its thunder as Barney stepped across the switch. Valancy\r\nwas a few steps behind him, loitering to gather June-bells along the\r\nlittle, winding path. But there was plenty of time to get across before\r\nthe train came. She stepped unconcernedly over the first rail.\r\n\r\nShe could never tell how it happened. The ensuing thirty seconds always\r\nseemed in her recollection like a chaotic nightmare in which she\r\nendured the agony of a thousand lifetimes.\r\n\r\nThe heel of her pretty, foolish shoe caught in a crevice of the switch.\r\nShe could not pull it loose.\r\n\r\n“Barney—Barney!” she called in alarm.\r\n\r\nBarney turned—saw her predicament—saw her ashen face—dashed back. He\r\ntried to pull her clear—he tried to wrench her foot from the prisoning\r\nhold. In vain. In a moment the train would sweep around the curve—would\r\nbe on them.\r\n\r\n“Go—go—quick—you’ll be killed, Barney!” shrieked Valancy, trying to\r\npush him away.\r\n\r\nBarney dropped on his knees, ghost-white, frantically tearing at her\r\nshoe-lace. The knot defied his trembling fingers. He snatched a knife\r\nfrom his pocket and slashed at it. Valancy still strove blindly to push\r\nhim away. Her mind was full of the hideous thought that Barney was\r\ngoing to be killed. She had no thought for her own danger.\r\n\r\n“Barney—go—go—for God’s sake—go!”\r\n\r\n“Never!” muttered Barney between his set teeth. He gave one mad wrench\r\nat the lace. As the train thundered around the curve he sprang up and\r\ncaught Valancy—dragging her clear, leaving the shoe behind her. The\r\nwind from the train as it swept by turned to icy cold the streaming\r\nperspiration on his face.\r\n\r\n“Thank God!” he breathed.\r\n\r\nFor a moment they stood stupidly staring at each other, two white,\r\nshaken, wild-eyed creatures. Then they stumbled over to the little seat\r\nat the end of the station-house and dropped on it. Barney buried his\r\nface in his hands and said not a word. Valancy sat, staring straight\r\nahead of her with unseeing eyes at the great pine woods, the stumps of\r\nthe clearing, the long, gleaming rails. There was only one thought in\r\nher dazed mind—a thought that seemed to burn it as a shaving of fire\r\nmight burn her body.\r\n\r\nDr. Trent had told her over a year ago that she had a serious form of\r\nheart-disease—that any excitement might be fatal.\r\n\r\nIf that were so, why was she not dead now? This very minute? She had\r\njust experienced as much and as terrible excitement as most people\r\nexperience in a lifetime, crowded into that endless thirty seconds. Yet\r\nshe had not died of it. She was not an iota the worse for it. A little\r\nwobbly at the knees, as any one would have been; a quicker heart-beat,\r\nas any one would have; nothing more.\r\n\r\nWhy!\r\n\r\n_Was it possible Dr. Trent had made a mistake?_\r\n\r\nValancy shivered as if a cold wind had suddenly chilled her to the\r\nsoul. She looked at Barney, hunched up beside her. His silence was very\r\neloquent. Had the same thought occurred to him? Did he suddenly find\r\nhimself confronted by the appalling suspicion that he was married, not\r\nfor a few months or a year, but for good and all to a woman he did not\r\nlove and who had foisted herself upon him by some trick or lie? Valancy\r\nturned sick before the horror of it. It could not be. It would be too\r\ncruel—too devilish. Dr. Trent _couldn’t_ have made a mistake.\r\nImpossible. He was one of the best heart specialists in Ontario. She\r\nwas foolish—unnerved by the recent horror. She remembered some of the\r\nhideous spasms of pain she had had. There must be something serious the\r\nmatter with her heart to account for them.\r\n\r\nBut she had not had any for nearly three months.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nPresently Barney bestirred himself. He stood up, without looking at\r\nValancy, and said casually:\r\n\r\n“I suppose we’d better be hiking back. Sun’s getting low. Are you good\r\nfor the rest of the road?”\r\n\r\n“I think so,” said Valancy miserably.\r\n\r\nBarney went across the clearing and picked up the parcel he had\r\ndropped—the parcel containing her new shoes. He brought it to her and\r\nlet her take out the shoes and put them on without any assistance,\r\nwhile he stood with his back to her and looked out over the pines.\r\n\r\nThey walked in silence down the shadowy trail to the lake. In silence\r\nBarney steered his boat into the sunset miracle that was Mistawis. In\r\nsilence they went around feathery headlands and across coral bays and\r\nsilver rivers where canoes were slipping up and down in the afterglow.\r\nIn silence they went past cottages echoing with music and laughter. In\r\nsilence drew up at the landing-place below the Blue Castle.\r\n\r\nValancy went up the rock steps and into the house. She dropped\r\nmiserably on the first chair she came to and sat there staring through\r\nthe oriel, oblivious of Good Luck’s frantic purrs of joy and Banjo’s\r\nsavage glares of protest at her occupancy of his chair.\r\n\r\nBarney came in a few minutes later. He did not come near her, but he\r\nstood behind her and asked gently if she felt any the worse for her\r\nexperience. Valancy would have given her year of happiness to have been\r\nable honestly to answer “Yes.”\r\n\r\n“No,” she said flatly.\r\n\r\nBarney went into Bluebeard’s Chamber and shut the door. She heard him\r\npacing up and down—up and down. He had never paced like that before.\r\n\r\nAnd an hour ago—only an hour ago—she had been so happy!"

      "content": "Finally Valancy went to bed. Before she went she re-read Dr. Trent’s\r\nletter. It comforted her a little. So positive. So assured. The writing\r\nso black and steady. Not the writing of a man who didn’t know what he\r\nwas writing about. But she could not sleep. She pretended to be asleep\r\nwhen Barney came in. Barney pretended to go to sleep. But Valancy knew\r\nperfectly well he wasn’t sleeping any more than she was. She knew he\r\nwas lying there, staring through the darkness. Thinking of what? Trying\r\nto face—what?\r\n\r\nValancy, who had spent so many happy wakeful hours of night lying by\r\nthat window, now paid the price of them all in this one night of\r\nmisery. A horrible, portentous fact was slowly looming out before her\r\nfrom the nebula of surmise and fear. She could not shut her eyes to\r\nit—push it away—ignore it.\r\n\r\nThere could be nothing seriously wrong with her heart, no matter what\r\nDr. Trent had said. If there had been, those thirty seconds would have\r\nkilled her. It was no use to recall Dr. Trent’s letter and reputation.\r\nThe greatest specialists made mistakes sometimes. Dr. Trent had made\r\none.\r\n\r\nTowards morning Valancy fell into a fitful doze with ridiculous dreams.\r\nOne of them was of Barney taunting her with having tricked him. In her\r\ndream she lost her temper and struck him violently on the head with her\r\nrolling-pin. He proved to be made of glass and shivered into splinters\r\nall over the floor. She woke with a cry of horror—a gasp of relief—a\r\nshort laugh over the absurdity of her dream—a miserable sickening\r\nrecollection of what had happened.\r\n\r\nBarney was gone. Valancy knew, as people sometimes know\r\nthings—inescapably, without being told—that he was not in the house or\r\nin Bluebeard’s Chamber either. There was a curious silence in the\r\nliving-room. A silence with something uncanny about it. The old clock\r\nhad stopped. Barney must have forgotten to wind it up, something he had\r\nnever done before. The room without it was dead, though the sunshine\r\nstreamed in through the oriel and dimples of light from the dancing\r\nwaves beyond quivered over the walls.\r\n\r\nThe canoe was gone but Lady Jane was under the mainland trees. So\r\nBarney had betaken himself to the wilds. He would not return till\r\nnight—perhaps not even then. He must be angry with her. That furious\r\nsilence of his must mean anger—cold, deep, justifiable resentment.\r\nWell, Valancy knew what she must do first. She was not suffering very\r\nkeenly now. Yet the curious numbness that pervaded her being was in a\r\nway worse than pain. It was as if something in her had died. She forced\r\nherself to cook and eat a little breakfast. Mechanically she put the\r\nBlue Castle in perfect order. Then she put on her hat and coat, locked\r\nthe door and hid the key in the hollow of the old pine and crossed to\r\nthe mainland in the motor boat. She was going into Deerwood to see Dr.\r\nTrent. She must _know_."

      "content": "Dr. Trent looked at her blankly and fumbled among his recollections.\r\n\r\n“Er—Miss—Miss—”\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Snaith,” said Valancy quietly. “I was Miss Valancy Stirling when\r\nI came to you last May—over a year ago. I wanted to consult you about\r\nmy heart.”\r\n\r\nDr. Trent’s face cleared.\r\n\r\n“Oh, of course. I remember now. I’m really not to blame for not knowing\r\nyou. You’ve changed—splendidly. And married. Well, well, it has agreed\r\nwith you. You don’t look much like an invalid now, hey? I remember that\r\nday. I was badly upset. Hearing about poor Ned bowled me over. But\r\nNed’s as good as new and you, too, evidently. I told you so, you\r\nknow—told you there was nothing to worry over.”\r\n\r\nValancy looked at him.\r\n\r\n“You told me, in your letter,” she said slowly, with a curious feeling\r\nthat some one else was talking through her lips, “that I had angina\r\npectoris—in the last stages—complicated with an aneurism. That I might\r\ndie any minute—that I couldn’t live longer than a year.”\r\n\r\nDr. Trent stared at her.\r\n\r\n“Impossible!” he said blankly. “I couldn’t have told you that!”\r\n\r\nValancy took his letter from her bag and handed it to him.\r\n\r\n“Miss Valancy Stirling,” he read. “Yes—yes. Of course I wrote you—on\r\nthe train—that night. But I _told_ you there was nothing serious——”\r\n\r\n“Read your letter,” insisted Valancy.\r\n\r\nDr. Trent took it out—unfolded it—glanced over it. A dismayed look came\r\ninto his face. He jumped to his feet and strode agitatedly about the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n“Good heavens! This is the letter I meant for old Miss Jane Sterling.\r\nFrom Port Lawrence. She was here that day, too. I sent you the wrong\r\nletter. What unpardonable carelessness! But I was beside myself that\r\nnight. My God, and you believed that—you believed—but you didn’t—you\r\nwent to another doctor——”\r\n\r\nValancy stood up, turned round, looked foolishly about her and sat down\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n“I believed it,” she said faintly. “I didn’t go to any other doctor.\r\nI—I—it would take too long to explain. But I believed I was going to\r\ndie soon.”\r\n\r\nDr. Trent halted before her.\r\n\r\n“I can never forgive myself. What a year you must have had! But you\r\ndon’t look—I can’t understand!”\r\n\r\n“Never mind,” said Valancy dully. “And so there’s nothing the matter\r\nwith my heart?”\r\n\r\n“Well, nothing serious. You had what is called pseudo-angina. It’s\r\nnever fatal—passes away completely with proper treatment. Or sometimes\r\nwith a shock of joy. Have you been troubled much with it?”\r\n\r\n“Not at all since March,” answered Valancy. She remembered the\r\nmarvellous feeling of re-creation she had had when she saw Barney\r\ncoming home safe after the storm. Had that “shock of joy” cured her?\r\n\r\n“Then likely you’re all right. I told you what to do in the letter you\r\nshould have got. _And_ of course I supposed you’d go to another doctor.\r\nChild, why didn’t you?”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t want anybody to know.”\r\n\r\n“Idiot,” said Dr. Trent bluntly. “I can’t understand such folly. And\r\npoor old Miss Sterling. She must have got your letter—telling her there\r\nwas nothing serious the matter. Well, well, it couldn’t have made any\r\ndifference. Her case was hopeless. Nothing that she could have done or\r\nleft undone could have made any difference. I was surprised she lived\r\nas long as she did—two months. She was here that day—not long before\r\nyou. I hated to tell her the truth. You think I’m a blunt old\r\ncurmudgeon—and my letters _are_ blunt enough. I can’t soften things.\r\nBut I’m a snivelling coward when it comes to telling a woman face to\r\nface that she’s got to die soon. I told her I’d look up some features\r\nof the case I wasn’t quite sure of and let her know next day. But you\r\ngot her letter—look here, ‘Dear Miss S-t-_e_-r-l-i-n-g.’”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I noticed that. But I thought it a mistake. I didn’t know there\r\nwere any Sterlings in Port Lawrence.”\r\n\r\n“She was the only one. A lonely old soul. Lived by herself with only a\r\nlittle home girl. She died two months after she was here—died in her\r\nsleep. My mistake couldn’t have made any difference to her. But you! I\r\ncan’t forgive myself for inflicting a year’s misery on you. It’s time I\r\nretired, all right, when I do things like that—even if my son was\r\nsupposed to be fatally injured. Can you ever forgive me?”\r\n\r\nA year of misery! Valancy smiled a tortured smile as she thought of all\r\nthe happiness Dr. Trent’s mistake had bought her. But she was paying\r\nfor it now—oh, she was paying. If to feel was to live she was living\r\nwith a vengeance.\r\n\r\nShe let Dr. Trent examine her and answered all his questions. When he\r\ntold her she was fit as a fiddle and would probably live to be a\r\nhundred, she got up and went away silently. She knew that there were a\r\ngreat many horrible things outside waiting to be thought over. Dr.\r\nTrent thought she was odd. Anybody would have thought, from her\r\nhopeless eyes and woebegone face, that he had given her a sentence of\r\ndeath instead of life. Snaith? Snaith? Who the devil had she married?\r\nHe had never heard of Snaiths in Deerwood. And she had been such a\r\nsallow, faded, little old maid. Gad, but marriage _had_ made a\r\ndifference in her, anyhow, whoever Snaith was. Snaith? Dr. Trent\r\nremembered. That rapscallion “up back!” Had Valancy Stirling married\r\n_him_? And her clan had let her! Well, probably that solved the\r\nmystery. She had married in haste and repented at leisure, and that was\r\nwhy she wasn’t overjoyed at learning she was a good insurance prospect,\r\nafter all. Married! To God knew whom! Or what! Jail-bird? Defaulter?\r\nFugitive from justice? It must be pretty bad if she had looked to death\r\nas a release, poor girl. But why were women such fools? Dr. Trent\r\ndismissed Valancy from his mind, though to the day of his death he was\r\nashamed of putting those letters into the wrong envelopes."

      "content": "Valancy walked quickly through the back streets and through Lover’s\r\nLane. She did not want to meet any one she knew. She didn’t want to\r\nmeet even people she didn’t know. She hated to be seen. Her mind was so\r\nconfused, so torn, so messy. She felt that her appearance must be the\r\nsame. She drew a sobbing breath of relief as she left the village\r\nbehind and found herself on the “up back” road. There was little fear\r\nof meeting any one she knew here. The cars that fled by her with\r\nraucous shrieks were filled with strangers. One of them was packed with\r\nyoung people who whirled past her singing uproariously:\r\n\r\n“My wife has the fever, O then,\r\nMy wife has the fever, O then,\r\nMy wife has the fever,\r\nOh, I hope it won’t leave her,\r\nFor I want to be single again.”\r\n\nValancy flinched as if one of them had leaned from the car and cut her\r\nacross the face with a whip.\r\n\r\nShe had made a covenant with death and death had cheated her. Now life\r\nstood mocking her. She had trapped Barney. Trapped him into marrying\r\nher. And divorce was so hard to get in Ontario. So expensive. And\r\nBarney was poor.\r\n\r\nWith life, fear had come back into her heart. Sickening fear. Fear of\r\nwhat Barney would think. Would say. Fear of the future that must be\r\nlived without him. Fear of her insulted, repudiated clan.\r\n\r\nShe had had one draught from a divine cup and now it was dashed from\r\nher lips. With no kind, friendly death to rescue her. She must go on\r\nliving and longing for it. Everything was spoiled, smirched, defaced.\r\nEven that year in the Blue Castle. Even her unashamed love for Barney.\r\nIt had been beautiful because death waited. Now it was only sordid\r\nbecause death was gone. How could any one bear an unbearable thing?\r\n\r\nShe must go back and tell him. Make him believe she had not meant to\r\ntrick him—she _must_ make him believe that. She must say good-bye to\r\nher Blue Castle and return to the brick house on Elm Street. Back to\r\neverything she had thought left behind forever. The old bondage—the old\r\nfears. But that did not matter. All that mattered now was that Barney\r\nmust somehow be made to believe she had not consciously tricked him.\r\n\r\nWhen Valancy reached the pines by the lake she was brought out of her\r\ndaze of pain by a startling sight. There, parked by the side of old,\r\nbattered ragged Lady Jane, was another car. A wonderful car. A purple\r\ncar. Not a dark, royal purple but a blatant, screaming purple. It shone\r\nlike a mirror and its interior plainly indicated the car caste of Vere\r\nde Vere. On the driver’s seat sat a haughty chauffeur in livery. And in\r\nthe tonneau sat a man who opened the door and bounced out nimbly as\r\nValancy came down the path to the landing-place. He stood under the\r\npines waiting for her and Valancy took in every detail of him.\r\n\r\nA stout, short, pudgy man, with a broad, rubicund, good-humoured face—a\r\nclean-shaven face, though an unparalysed little imp at the back of\r\nValancy’s paralysed mind suggested the thought, “Such a face should\r\nhave a fringe of white whisker around it.” Old-fashioned, steel-rimmed\r\nspectacles on prominent blue eyes. A pursey mouth; a little round,\r\nknobby nose. Where—where—where, groped Valancy, had she seen that face\r\nbefore? It seemed as familiar to her as her own.\r\n\r\nThe stranger wore a green hat and a light fawn overcoat over a suit of\r\na loud check pattern. His tie was a brilliant green of lighter shade;\r\non the plump hand he outstretched to intercept Valancy an enormous\r\ndiamond winked at her. But he had a pleasant, fatherly smile, and in\r\nhis hearty, unmodulated voice was a ring of something that attracted\r\nher.\r\n\r\n“Can you tell me, Miss, if that house yonder belongs to a Mr. Redfern?\r\nAnd if so, how can I get to it?”\r\n\r\nRedfern! A vision of bottles seemed to dance before Valancy’s eyes—long\r\nbottles of bitters—round bottles of hair tonic—square bottles of\r\nliniment—short, corpulent little bottles of purple pills—and all of\r\nthem bearing that very prosperous, beaming moon-face and steel-rimmed\r\nspectacles on the label.\r\n\r\nDr. Redfern!\r\n\r\n“No,” said Valancy faintly. “No—that house belongs to Mr. Snaith.”\r\n\r\nDr. Redfern nodded.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I understand Bernie’s been calling himself Snaith. Well, it’s his\r\nmiddle name—was his poor mother’s. Bernard Snaith Redfern—that’s him.\r\nAnd now, Miss, you can tell me how to get over to that island? Nobody\r\nseems to be home there. I’ve done some waving and yelling. Henry,\r\nthere, wouldn’t yell. He’s a one-job man. But old Doc Redfern can yell\r\nwith the best of them yet, and ain’t above doing it. Raised nothing but\r\na couple of crows. Guess Bernie’s out for the day.”\r\n\r\n“He was away when I left this morning,” said Valancy. “I suppose he\r\nhasn’t come home yet.”\r\n\r\nShe spoke flatly and tonelessly. This last shock had temporarily bereft\r\nher of whatever little power of reasoning had been left her by Dr.\r\nTrent’s revelation. In the back of her mind the aforesaid little imp\r\nwas jeeringly repeating a silly old proverb, “It never rains but it\r\npours.” But she was not trying to think. What was the use?\r\n\r\nDr. Redfern was gazing at her in perplexity.\r\n\r\n“When you left this morning? Do you live—over there?”\r\n\r\nHe waved his diamond at the Blue Castle.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said Valancy stupidly. “I’m his wife.”\r\n\r\nDr. Redfern took out a yellow silk handkerchief, removed his hat and\r\nmopped his brow. He was very bald, and Valancy’s imp whispered, “Why be\r\nbald? Why lose your manly beauty? Try Redfern’s Hair Vigor. It keeps\r\nyou young.”\r\n\r\n“Excuse me,” said Dr. Redfern. “This is a bit of a shock.”\r\n\r\n“Shocks seem to be in the air this morning.” The imp said this out loud\r\nbefore Valancy could prevent it.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t know Bernie was—married. I didn’t think he _would_ have got\r\nmarried without telling his old dad.”\r\n\r\nWere Dr. Redfern’s eyes misty? Amid her own dull ache of misery and\r\nfear and dread, Valancy felt a pang of pity for him.\r\n\r\n“Don’t blame him,” she said hurriedly. “It—it wasn’t his fault. It—was\r\nall my doing.”\r\n\r\n“You didn’t ask him to marry you, I suppose,” twinkled Dr. Redfern. “He\r\nmight have let me know. I’d have got acquainted with my daughter-in-law\r\nbefore this if he had. But I’m glad to meet you now, my dear—very glad.\r\nYou look like a sensible young woman. I used to sorter fear Barney’d\r\npick out some pretty bit of fluff just because she was good-looking.\r\nThey were all after him, of course. Wanted his money? Eh? Didn’t like\r\nthe pills and the bitters but liked the dollars. Eh? Wanted to dip\r\ntheir pretty little fingers in old Doc’s millions. Eh?”\r\n\r\n“Millions!” said Valancy faintly. She wished she could sit down\r\nsomewhere—she wished she could have a chance to think—she wished she\r\nand the Blue Castle could sink to the bottom of Mistawis and vanish\r\nfrom human sight forevermore.\r\n\r\n“Millions,” said Dr. Redfern complacently. “And Bernie chucks them\r\nfor—that.” Again he shook the diamond contemptuously at the Blue\r\nCastle. “Wouldn’t you think he’d have more sense? And all on account of\r\na white bit of a girl. He must have got over _that_ feeling, anyhow,\r\nsince he’s married. You must persuade him to come back to civilisation.\r\nAll nonsense wasting his life like this. Ain’t you going to take me\r\nover to your house, my dear? I suppose you’ve some way of getting\r\nthere.”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said Valancy stupidly. She led the way down to the little\r\ncove where the disappearing propeller boat was snuggled.\r\n\r\n“Does your—your man want to come, too?”\r\n\r\n“Who? Henry. Not he. Look at him sitting there disapproving.\r\nDisapproves of the whole expedition. The trail up from the road nearly\r\ngave him a conniption. Well, it _was_ a devilish road to put a car on.\r\nWhose old bus is that up there?”\r\n\r\n“Barney’s.”\r\n\r\n“Good Lord! Does Bernie Redfern ride in a thing like that? It looks\r\nlike the great-great-grandmother of all the Fords.”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t a Ford. It’s a Grey Slosson,” said Valancy spiritedly. For\r\nsome occult reason, Dr. Redfern’s good-humoured ridicule of dear old\r\nLady Jane stung her to life. A life that was all pain but still _life_.\r\nBetter than the horrible half-dead-and-half-aliveness of the past few\r\nminutes—or years. She waved Dr. Redfern curtly into the boat and took\r\nhim over to the Blue Castle. The key was still in the old pine—the\r\nhouse still silent and deserted. Valancy took the doctor through the\r\nliving-room to the western verandah. She must at least be out where\r\nthere was air. It was still sunny, but in the southwest a great\r\nthundercloud, with white crests and gorges of purple shadow, was slowly\r\nrising over Mistawis. The doctor dropped with a gasp on a rustic chair\r\nand mopped his brow again.\r\n\r\n“Warm, eh? Lord, what a view! Wonder if it would soften Henry if he\r\ncould see it.”\r\n\r\n“Have you had dinner?” asked Valancy.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my dear—had it before we left Port Lawrence. Didn’t know what\r\nsort of wild hermit’s hollow we were coming to, you see. Hadn’t any\r\nidea I was going to find a nice little daughter-in-law here all ready\r\nto toss me up a meal. Cats, eh? Puss, puss! See that. Cats love me.\r\nBernie was always fond of cats! It’s about the only thing he took from\r\nme. He’s his poor mother’s boy.”\r\n\r\nValancy had been thinking idly that Barney must resemble his mother.\r\nShe had remained standing by the steps, but Dr. Redfern waved her to\r\nthe swing seat.\r\n\r\n“Sit down, dear. Never stand when you can sit. I want to get a good\r\nlook at Barney’s wife. Well, well, I like your face. No beauty—you\r\ndon’t mind my saying that—you’ve sense enough to know it, I reckon. Sit\r\ndown.”\r\n\r\nValancy sat down. To be obliged to sit still when mental agony urges us\r\nto stride up and down is the refinement of torture. Every nerve in her\r\nbeing was crying out to be alone—to be hidden. But she had to sit and\r\nlisten to Dr. Redfern, who didn’t mind talking at all.\r\n\r\n“When do you think Bernie will be back?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know—not before night probably.”\r\n\r\n“Where did he go?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know that either. Likely to the woods—up back.”\r\n\r\n“So he doesn’t tell you his comings and goings, either? Bernie was\r\nalways a secretive young devil. Never understood him. Just like his\r\npoor mother. But I thought a lot of him. It hurt me when he disappeared\r\nas he did. Eleven years ago. I haven’t seen my boy for eleven years.”\r\n\r\n“Eleven years.” Valancy was surprised. “It’s only six since he came\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, he was in the Klondike before that—and all over the world. He used\r\nto drop me a line now and then—never give any clue to where he was but\r\njust a line to say he was all right. I s’pose he’s told you all about\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“No. I know nothing of his past life,” said Valancy with sudden\r\neagerness. She wanted to know—she must know now. It hadn’t mattered\r\nbefore. Now she must know all. And she could never hear it from Barney.\r\nShe might never even see him again. If she did, it would not be to talk\r\nof his past.\r\n\r\n“What happened? Why did he leave his home? Tell me. Tell me.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it ain’t much of a story. Just a young fool gone mad because of\r\na quarrel with his girl. Only Bernie was a stubborn fool. Always\r\nstubborn. You never could make that boy do anything he didn’t want to\r\ndo. From the day he was born. Yet he was always a quiet, gentle little\r\nchap, too. Good as gold. His poor mother died when he was only two\r\nyears old. I’d just begun to make money with my Hair Vigor. I’d dreamed\r\nthe formula for it, you see. Some dream that. The cash rolled in.\r\nBernie had everything he wanted. I sent him to the best schools—private\r\nschools. I meant to make a gentleman of him. Never had any chance\r\nmyself. Meant he should have every chance. He went through McGill. Got\r\nhonours and all that. I wanted him to go in for law. He hankered after\r\njournalism and stuff like that. Wanted me to buy a paper for him—or\r\nback him in publishing what he called a ‘real, worthwhile,\r\nhonest-to-goodness Canadian Magazine.’ I s’pose I’d have done it—I\r\nalways did what he wanted me to do. Wasn’t he all I had to live for? I\r\nwanted him to be happy. And he never was happy. Can you believe it? Not\r\nthat he said so. But I’d always a feeling that he wasn’t happy.\r\nEverything he wanted—all the money he could spend—his own bank\r\naccount—travel—seeing the world—but he wasn’t happy. Not till he fell\r\nin love with Ethel Traverse. Then he was happy for a little while.”\r\n\r\nThe cloud had reached the sun and a great, chill, purple shadow came\r\nswiftly over Mistawis. It touched the Blue Castle—rolled over it.\r\nValancy shivered.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she said, with painful eagerness, though every word was cutting\r\nher to the heart. “What—was—she—like?”\r\n\r\n“Prettiest girl in Montreal,” said Dr. Redfern. “Oh, she was a looker,\r\nall right. Eh? Gold hair—shiny as silk—great, big, soft, black\r\neyes—skin like milk and roses. Don’t wonder Bernie fell for her. And\r\nbrains as well. _She_ wasn’t a bit of fluff. B. A. from McGill. A\r\nthoroughbred, too. One of the best families. But a bit lean in the\r\npurse. Eh! Bernie was mad about her. Happiest young fool you ever saw.\r\nThen—the bust-up.”\r\n\r\n“What happened?” Valancy had taken off her hat and was absently\r\nthrusting a pin in and out of it. Good Luck was purring beside her.\r\nBanjo was regarding Dr. Redfern with suspicion. Nip and Tuck were\r\nlazily cawing in the pines. Mistawis was beckoning. Everything was the\r\nsame. Nothing was the same. It was a hundred years since yesterday.\r\nYesterday, at this time, she and Barney had been eating a belated\r\ndinner here with laughter. Laughter? Valancy felt that she had done\r\nwith laughter forever. And with tears, for that matter. She had no\r\nfurther use for either of them.\r\n\r\n“Blest if I know, my dear. Some fool quarrel, I suppose. Bernie just\r\nlit out—disappeared. He wrote me from the Yukon. Said his engagement\r\nwas broken and he wasn’t coming back. And not to try to hunt him up\r\nbecause he was never coming back. I didn’t. What was the use? I knew\r\nBernie. I went on piling up money because there wasn’t anything else\r\nto do. But I was mighty lonely. All I lived for was them little notes\r\nnow and then from Bernie—Klondike—England—South\r\nAfrica—China—everywhere. I thought maybe he’d come back some day to his\r\nlonesome old dad. Then six years ago even the letters stopped. I didn’t\r\nhear a word of or from him till last Christmas.”\r\n\r\n“Did he write?”\r\n\r\n“No. But he drew a check for fifteen thousand dollars on his bank\r\naccount. The bank manager is a friend of mine—one of my biggest\r\nshareholders. He’d always promised me he’d let me know if Bernie drew\r\nany checks. Bernie had fifty thousand there. And he’d never touched a\r\ncent of it till last Christmas. The check was made out to Aynsley’s,\r\nToronto——”\r\n\r\n“Aynsley’s?” Valancy heard herself saying Aynsley’s! She had a box on\r\nher dressing-table with the Aynsley trademark.\r\n\r\n“Yes. The big jewellery house there. After I’d thought it over a while,\r\nI got brisk. I wanted to locate Bernie. Had a special reason for it. It\r\nwas time he gave up his fool hoboing and come to his senses. Drawing\r\nthat fifteen told me there was something in the wind. The manager\r\ncommunicated with the Aynsleys—his wife was an Aynsley—and found out\r\nthat Bernard Redfern had bought a pearl necklace there. His address was\r\ngiven as Box 444, Port Lawrence, Muskoka, Ont. First I thought I’d\r\nwrite. Then I thought I’d wait till the open season for cars and come\r\ndown myself. Ain’t no hand at writing. I’ve motored from Montreal. Got\r\nto Port Lawrence yesterday. Enquired at the post-office. Told me they\r\nknew nothing of any Bernard Snaith Redfern, but there was a Barney\r\nSnaith had a P. O. box there. Lived on an island out here, they said.\r\nSo here I am. And where’s Barney?”\r\n\r\nValancy was fingering her necklace. She was wearing fifteen thousand\r\ndollars around her neck. And she had worried lest Barney had paid\r\nfifteen dollars for it and couldn’t afford it. Suddenly she laughed in\r\nDr. Redfern’s face.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me. It’s so—amusing,” said poor Valancy.\r\n\r\n“Isn’t it?” said Dr. Redfern, seeing a joke—but not exactly hers. “Now,\r\nyou seem like a sensible young woman, and I dare say you’ve lots of\r\ninfluence over Bernie. Can’t you get him to come back to civilisation\r\nand live like other people? I’ve a house up there. Big as a castle.\r\nFurnished like a palace. I want company in it—Bernie’s wife—Bernie’s\r\nchildren.”\r\n\r\n“Did Ethel Traverse ever marry?” queried Valancy irrelevantly.\r\n\r\n“Bless you, yes. Two years after Bernie levanted. But she’s a widow\r\nnow. Pretty as ever. To be frank, that was my special reason for\r\nwanting to find Bernie. I thought they’d make it up, maybe. But, of\r\ncourse, that’s all off now. Doesn’t matter. Bernie’s choice of a wife\r\nis good enough for me. It’s my boy I want. Think he’ll soon be back?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. But I don’t think he’ll come before night. Quite late,\r\nperhaps. And perhaps not till tomorrow. But I can put you up\r\ncomfortably. He’ll certainly be back tomorrow.”\r\n\r\nDr. Redfern shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Too damp. I’ll take no chances with rheumatism.”\r\n\r\n“Why suffer that ceaseless anguish? Why not try Redfern’s Liniment?”\r\nquoted the imp in the back of Valancy’s mind.\r\n\r\n“I must get back to Port Lawrence before rain starts. Henry goes quite\r\nmad when he gets mud on the car. But I’ll come back tomorrow. Meanwhile\r\nyou talk Bernie into reason.”\r\n\r\nHe shook her hand and patted her kindly on the shoulder. He looked as\r\nif he would have kissed her, with a little encouragement, but Valancy\r\ndid not give it. Not that she would have minded. He was rather dreadful\r\nand loud—and—and—dreadful. But there was something about him she liked.\r\nShe thought dully that she might have liked being his daughter-in-law\r\nif he had not been a millionaire. A score of times over. And Barney was\r\nhis son—and heir.\r\n\r\nShe took him over in the motor boat and watched the lordly purple car\r\nroll away through the woods with Henry at the wheel looking things not\r\nlawful to be uttered. Then she went back to the Blue Castle. What she\r\nhad to do must be done quickly. Barney _might_ return at any moment.\r\nAnd it was certainly going to rain. She was thankful she no longer felt\r\nvery bad. When you are bludgeoned on the head repeatedly, you naturally\r\nand mercifully become more or less insensible and stupid.\r\n\r\nShe stood briefly like a faded flower bitten by frost, by the hearth,\r\nlooking down on the white ashes of the last fire that had blazed in the\r\nBlue Castle.\r\n\r\n“At any rate,” she thought wearily, “Barney isn’t poor. He will be able\r\nto afford a divorce. Quite nicely.”"

      "content": "She must write a note. The imp in the back of her mind laughed. In\r\nevery story she had ever read when a runaway wife decamped from home\r\nshe left a note, generally on the pin-cushion. It was not a very\r\noriginal idea. But one had to leave something intelligible. What was\r\nthere to do but write a note? She looked vaguely about her for\r\nsomething to write with. Ink? There was none. Valancy had never written\r\nanything since she had come to the Blue Castle, save memoranda of\r\nhousehold necessaries for Barney. A pencil sufficed for them, but now\r\nthe pencil was not to be found. Valancy absently crossed to the door of\r\nBluebeard’s Chamber and tried it. She vaguely expected to find it\r\nlocked, but it opened unresistingly. She had never tried it before, and\r\ndid not know whether Barney habitually kept it locked or not. If he\r\ndid, he must have been badly upset to leave it unlocked. She did not\r\nrealise that she was doing something he had told her not to do. She was\r\nonly looking for something to write with. All her faculties were\r\nconcentrated on deciding just what she would say and how she would say\r\nit. There was not the slightest curiosity in her as she went into the\r\nlean-to.\r\n\r\nThere were no beautiful women hanging by their hair on the walls. It\r\nseemed a very harmless apartment, with a commonplace little sheet-iron\r\nstove in the middle of it, its pipe sticking out through the roof. At\r\none end was a table or counter crowded with odd-looking utensils. Used\r\nno doubt by Barney in his smelly operations. Chemical experiments,\r\nprobably, she reflected dully. At the other end was a big writing desk\r\nand swivel-chair. The side walls were lined with books.\r\n\r\nValancy went blindly to the desk. There she stood motionless for a few\r\nminutes, looking down at something that lay on it. A bundle of\r\ngalley-proofs. The page on top bore the title _Wild Honey_, and under\r\nthe title were the words “by John Foster.”\r\n\r\nThe opening sentence—“Pines are the trees of myth and legend. They\r\nstrike their roots deep into the traditions of an older world, but wind\r\nand star love their lofty tops. What music when old Æolus draws his bow\r\nacross the branches of the pines—” She had heard Barney say that one\r\nday when they walked under them.\r\n\r\nSo Barney was John Foster!\r\n\r\nValancy was not excited. She had absorbed all the shocks and sensations\r\nthat she could compass for one day. This affected her neither one way\r\nnor the other. She only thought:\r\n\r\n“So this explains it.”\r\n\r\n“It” was a small matter that had, somehow, stuck in her mind more\r\npersistently than its importance seemed to justify. Soon after Barney\r\nhad brought her John Foster’s latest book she had been in a Port\r\nLawrence bookshop and heard a customer ask the proprietor for John\r\nFoster’s new book. The proprietor had said curtly, “Not out yet. Won’t\r\nbe out till next week.”\r\n\r\nValancy had opened her lips to say, “Oh, yes, it _is_ out,” but closed\r\nthem again. After all, it was none of her business. She supposed the\r\nproprietor wanted to cover up his negligence in not getting the book in\r\npromptly. Now she knew. The book Barney had given her had been one of\r\nthe author’s complimentary copies, sent in advance.\r\n\r\nWell! Valancy pushed the proofs indifferently aside and sat down in the\r\nswivel-chair. She took up Barney’s pen—and a vile one it was—pulled a\r\nsheet of paper to her and began to write. She could not think of\r\nanything to say except bald facts.\r\n\n“Dear Barney:—\r\n\r\nI went to Dr. Trent this morning and found out he had sent me the wrong\r\nletter by mistake. There never was anything serious the matter with my\r\nheart and I am quite well now.\r\n\r\nI did not mean to trick you. Please believe that. I could not bear it\r\nif you did not believe that. I am very sorry for the mistake. But\r\nsurely you can get a divorce if I leave you. Is desertion a ground for\r\ndivorce in Canada? Of course if there is anything I can do to help or\r\nhasten it I will do it gladly, if your lawyer will let me know.\r\n\r\nI thank you for all your kindness to me. I shall never forget it. Think\r\nas kindly of me as you can, because I did not mean to trap you.\r\nGood-bye.\r\n\r\nYours gratefully,\r\n\r\nVALANCY.”\r\n\nIt was very cold and stiff, she knew. But to try to say anything else\r\nwould be dangerous—like tearing away a dam. She didn’t know what\r\ntorrent of wild incoherences and passionate anguish might pour out. In\r\na postscript she added:\r\n\n“Your father was here today. He is coming back tomorrow. He told me\r\neverything. I think you should go back to him. He is very lonely for\r\nyou.”\r\n\nShe put the letter in an envelope, wrote “Barney” across it, and left\r\nit on the desk. On it she laid the string of pearls. If they had been\r\nthe beads she believed them she would have kept them in memory of that\r\nwonderful year. But she could not keep the fifteen thousand dollar gift\r\nof a man who had married her out of pity and whom she was now leaving.\r\nIt hurt her to give up her pretty bauble. That was an odd thing, she\r\nreflected. The fact that she was leaving Barney did not hurt her—yet.\r\nIt lay at her heart like a cold, insensible thing. If it came to\r\nlife—Valancy shuddered and went out——\r\n\r\nShe put on her hat and mechanically fed Good Luck and Banjo. She locked\r\nthe door and carefully hid the key in the old pine. Then she crossed to\r\nthe mainland in the disappearing propeller. She stood for a moment on\r\nthe bank, looking at her Blue Castle. The rain had not yet come, but\r\nthe sky was dark, and Mistawis grey and sullen. The little house under\r\nthe pines looked very pathetic—a casket rifled of its jewels—a lamp\r\nwith its flame blown out.\r\n\r\n“I shall never again hear the wind crying over Mistawis at night,”\r\nthought Valancy. This hurt her, too. She could have laughed to think\r\nthat such a trifle could hurt her at such a time."

      "content": "Valancy paused a moment on the porch of the brick house in Elm Street.\r\nShe felt that she ought to knock like a stranger. Her rosebush, she\r\nidly noticed, was loaded with buds. The rubber-plant stood beside the\r\nprim door. A momentary horror overcame her—a horror of the existence to\r\nwhich she was returning. Then she opened the door and walked in.\r\n\r\n“I wonder if the Prodigal Son ever felt really at home again,” she\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nMrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles were in the sitting-room. Uncle\r\nBenjamin was there, too. They looked blankly at Valancy, realising at\r\nonce that something was wrong. This was not the saucy, impudent thing\r\nwho had laughed at them in this very room last summer. This was a\r\ngrey-faced woman with the eyes of a creature who had been stricken by a\r\nmortal blow.\r\n\r\nValancy looked indifferently around the room. She had changed so\r\nmuch—and it had changed so little. The same pictures hung on the walls.\r\nThe little orphan who knelt at her never-finished prayer by the bed\r\nwhereon reposed the black kitten that never grew up into a cat. The\r\ngrey “steel engraving” of Quatre Bras, where the British regiment\r\nforever stood at bay. The crayon enlargement of the boyish father she\r\nhad never known. There they all hung in the same places. The green\r\ncascade of “Wandering Jew” still tumbled out of the old granite\r\nsaucepan on the window-stand. The same elaborate, never-used pitcher\r\nstood at the same angle on the sideboard shelf. The blue and gilt vases\r\nthat had been among her mother’s wedding-presents still primly adorned\r\nthe mantelpiece, flanking the china clock of berosed and besprayed ware\r\nthat never went. The chairs in exactly the same places. Her mother and\r\nCousin Stickles, likewise unchanged, regarding her with stony\r\nunwelcome.\r\n\r\nValancy had to speak first.\r\n\r\n“I’ve come home, Mother,” she said tiredly.\r\n\r\n“So I see.” Mrs. Frederick’s voice was very icy. She had resigned\r\nherself to Valancy’s desertion. She had almost succeeded in forgetting\r\nthere was a Valancy. She had rearranged and organised her systematic\r\nlife without any reference to an ungrateful, rebellious child. She had\r\ntaken her place again in a society which ignored the fact that she had\r\never had a daughter and pitied her, if it pitied her at all, only in\r\ndiscreet whispers and asides. The plain truth was that, by this time,\r\nMrs. Frederick did not want Valancy to come back—did not want ever to\r\nsee or hear of her again.\r\n\r\nAnd now, of course, Valancy was here. With tragedy and disgrace and\r\nscandal trailing after her visibly. \r\n\r\n“So I see,” said Mrs. Frederick. “May I ask why?”\r\n\r\n“Because—I’m—not—going to die,” said Valancy huskily.\r\n\r\n“God bless my soul!” said Uncle Benjamin. “Who said you were going to\r\ndie?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose,” said Cousin Stickles shrewishly—Cousin Stickles did not\r\nwant Valancy back either—“I suppose you’ve found out he has another\r\nwife—as we’ve been sure all along.”\r\n\r\n“No. I only wish he had,” said Valancy. She was not suffering\r\nparticularly, but she was very tired. If only the explanations were all\r\nover and she were upstairs in her old, ugly room—alone. Just alone! The\r\nrattle of the beads on her mother’s sleeves, as they swung on the arms\r\nof the reed chair, almost drove her crazy. Nothing else was worrying\r\nher; but all at once it seemed that she simply could not endure that\r\nthin, insistent rattle.\r\n\r\n“My home, as I told you, is always open to you,” said Mrs. Frederick\r\nstonily, “but I can never forgive you.”\r\n\r\nValancy gave a mirthless laugh.\r\n\r\n“I’d care very little for that if I could only forgive myself,” she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“Come, come,” said Uncle Benjamin testily. But rather enjoying himself.\r\nHe felt he had Valancy under his thumb again. “We’ve had enough of\r\nmystery. What has happened? Why have you left that fellow? No doubt\r\nthere’s reason enough—but what particular reason is it?”\r\n\r\nValancy began to speak mechanically. She told her tale bluntly and\r\nbarely.\r\n\r\n“A year ago Dr. Trent told me I had angina pectoris and could not live\r\nlong. I wanted to have some—life—before I died. That’s why I went away.\r\nWhy I married Barney. And now I’ve found it is all a mistake. There is\r\nnothing wrong with my heart. I’ve got to live—and Barney only married\r\nme out of pity. So I have to leave him—free.”\r\n\r\n“God bless me!” said Uncle Benjamin. Cousin Stickles began to cry.\r\n\r\n“Valancy, if you’d only had confidence in your own mother——”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, I know,” said Valancy impatiently. “What’s the use of going\r\ninto that now? I can’t undo this year. God knows I wish I could. I’ve\r\ntricked Barney into marrying me—and he’s really Bernard Redfern. Dr.\r\nRedfern’s son, of Montreal. And his father wants him to go back to\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nUncle Benjamin made a queer sound. Cousin Stickles took her\r\nblack-bordered handkerchief away from her eyes and stared at Valancy. A\r\nqueer gleam suddenly shot into Mrs. Frederick’s stone-grey orbs.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Redfern—not the Purple Pill man?” she said.\r\n\r\nValancy nodded. “He’s John Foster, too—the writer of those nature\r\nbooks.”\r\n\r\n“But—but—” Mrs. Frederick was visibly agitated, though not over the\r\nthought that she was the mother-in-law of John Foster—“_Dr. Redfern is\r\na millionaire_!”\r\n\r\nUncle Benjamin shut his mouth with a snap.\r\n\r\n“Ten times over,” he said.\r\n\r\nValancy nodded.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Barney left home years ago—because of—of some\r\ntrouble—some—disappointment. Now he will likely go back. So you see—I\r\nhad to come home. He doesn’t love me. I can’t hold him to a bond he was\r\ntricked into.”\r\n\r\nUncle Benjamin looked incredibly sly.\r\n\r\n“Did he say so? Does he want to get rid of you?”\r\n\r\n“No. I haven’t seen him since I found out. But I tell you—he only\r\nmarried me out of pity—because I asked him to—because he thought it\r\nwould only be for a little while.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles both tried to speak, but Uncle\r\nBenjamin waved a hand at them and frowned portentously.\r\n\r\n“Let _me_ handle this,” wave and frown seemed to say. To Valancy:\r\n\r\n“Well, well, dear, we’ll talk it all over later. You see, we don’t\r\nquite understand everything yet. As Cousin Stickles says, you should\r\nhave confided in us before. Later on—I dare say we can find a way out\r\nof this.”\r\n\r\n“You think Barney can easily get a divorce, don’t you?” said Valancy\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\nUncle Benjamin silenced with another wave the exclamation of horror he\r\nknew was trembling on Mrs. Frederick’s lips.\r\n\r\n“Trust to me, Valancy. Everything will arrange itself. Tell me this,\r\nDossie. Have you been happy up back? Was Sn—Mr. Redfern good to you?”\r\n\r\n“I have been very happy and Barney was very good to me,” said Valancy,\r\nas if reciting a lesson. She remembered when she studied grammar at\r\nschool she had disliked the past and perfect tenses. They had always\r\nseemed so pathetic. “I have been”—it was all over and done with.\r\n\r\n“Then don’t worry, little girl.” How amazingly paternal Uncle Benjamin\r\nwas! “Your family will stand behind you. We’ll see what can be done.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said Valancy dully. Really, it was quite decent of Uncle\r\nBenjamin. “Can I go and lie down a little while? I’m—I’m—tired.”\r\n\r\n“Of course you’re tired.” Uncle Benjamin patted her hand gently—very\r\ngently. “All worn out and nervous. Go and lie down, by all means.\r\nYou’ll see things in quite a different light after you’ve had a good\r\nsleep.”\r\n\r\nHe held the door open. As she went through he whispered, “What is the\r\nbest way to keep a man’s love?”\r\n\r\nValancy smiled wanly. But she had come back to the old life—the old\r\nshackles. “What?” she asked as meekly as of yore.\r\n\r\n“Not to return it,” said Uncle Benjamin with a chuckle. He shut the\r\ndoor and rubbed his hands. Nodded and smiled mysteriously round the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n“Poor little Doss!” he said pathetically.\r\n\r\n“Do you really suppose that—Snaith—can actually be Dr. Redfern’s son?”\r\ngasped Mrs. Frederick.\r\n\r\n“I see no reason for doubting it. She says Dr. Redfern has been there.\r\nWhy, the man is rich as wedding-cake. Amelia, I’ve always believed\r\nthere was more in Doss than most people thought. You kept her down too\r\nmuch—repressed her. She never had a chance to show what was in her. And\r\nnow she’s landed a millionaire for a husband.”\r\n\r\n“But—” hesitated Mrs. Frederick, “he—he—they told terrible tales about\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“All gossip and invention—all gossip and invention. It’s always been a\r\nmystery to me why people should be so ready to invent and circulate\r\nslanders about other people they know absolutely nothing about. I can’t\r\nunderstand why you paid so much attention to gossip and surmise. Just\r\nbecause he didn’t choose to mix up with everybody, people resented it.\r\nI was surprised to find what a decent fellow he seemed to be that time\r\nhe came into my store with Valancy. I discounted all the yarns then and\r\nthere.”\r\n\r\n“But he was seen dead drunk in Port Lawrence once,” said Cousin\r\nStickles. Doubtfully, yet as one very willing to be convinced to the\r\ncontrary.\r\n\r\n“Who saw him?” demanded Uncle Benjamin truculently. “Who saw him? Old\r\nJemmy Strang _said_ he saw him. I wouldn’t take old Jemmy Strang’s word\r\non oath. He’s too drunk himself half the time to see straight. He said\r\nhe saw him lying drunk on a bench in the Park. Pshaw! Redfern’s been\r\nasleep there. Don’t worry over _that_.”\r\n\r\n“But his clothes—and that awful old car—” said Mrs. Frederick\r\nuncertainly.\r\n\r\n“Eccentricities of genius,” declared Uncle Benjamin. “You heard Doss\r\nsay he was John Foster. I’m not up in literature myself, but I heard a\r\nlecturer from Toronto say that John Foster’s books had put Canada on\r\nthe literary map of the world.”\r\n\r\n“I—suppose—we must forgive her,” yielded Mrs. Frederick.\r\n\r\n“Forgive her!” Uncle Benjamin snorted. Really, Amelia was an incredibly\r\nstupid woman. No wonder poor Doss had gone sick and tired of living\r\nwith her. “Well, yes, I think you’d better forgive her! The question\r\nis—will Snaith forgive _us_!”\r\n\r\n“What if she persists in leaving him? You’ve no idea how stubborn she\r\ncan be,” said Mrs. Frederick.\r\n\r\n“Leave it all to me, Amelia. Leave it all to me. You women have muddled\r\nit enough. This whole affair has been bungled from start to finish. If\r\nyou had put yourself to a little trouble years ago, Amelia, she would\r\nnot have bolted over the traces as she did. Just let her alone—don’t\r\nworry her with advice or questions till she’s ready to talk. She’s\r\nevidently run away in a panic because she’s afraid he’d be angry with\r\nher for fooling him. Most extraordinary thing of Trent to tell her such\r\na yarn! That’s what comes of going to strange doctors. Well, well, we\r\nmustn’t blame her too harshly, poor child. Redfern will come after her.\r\nIf he doesn’t, I’ll hunt him up and talk to him as man to man. He may\r\nbe a millionaire, but Valancy is a Stirling. He can’t repudiate her\r\njust because she was mistaken about her heart disease. Not likely he’ll\r\nwant to. Doss is a little overstrung. Bless me, I must get in the habit\r\nof calling her Valancy. She isn’t a baby any longer. Now, remember,\r\nAmelia. Be very kind and sympathetic.”\r\n\r\nIt was something of a large order to expect Mrs. Frederick to be kind\r\nand sympathetic. But she did her best. When supper was ready she went\r\nup and asked Valancy if she wouldn’t like a cup of tea. Valancy, lying\r\non her bed, declined. She just wanted to be left alone for a while.\r\nMrs. Frederick left her alone. She did not even remind Valancy that her\r\nplight was the outcome of her own lack of daughterly respect and\r\nobedience. One could not—exactly—say things like that to the\r\ndaughter-in-law of a millionaire."

      "content": "Valancy looked dully about her old room. It, too, was so exactly the\r\nsame that it seemed almost impossible to believe in the changes that\r\nhad come to her since she had last slept in it. It\r\nseemed—somehow—indecent that it should be so much the same. There was\r\nQueen Louise everlastingly coming down the stairway, and nobody had let\r\nthe forlorn puppy in out of the rain. Here was the purple paper blind\r\nand the greenish mirror. Outside, the old carriage-shop with its\r\nblatant advertisements. Beyond it, the station with the same derelicts\r\nand flirtatious flappers.\r\n\r\nHere the old life waited for her, like some grim ogre that bided his\r\ntime and licked his chops. A monstrous horror of it suddenly possessed\r\nher. When night fell and she had undressed and got into bed, the\r\nmerciful numbness passed away and she lay in anguish and thought of her\r\nisland under the stars. The camp-fires—all their little household jokes\r\nand phrases and catch words—their furry beautiful cats—the lights\r\nagleam on the fairy islands—canoes skimming over Mistawis in the magic\r\nof morning—white birches shining among the dark spruces like beautiful\r\nwomen’s bodies—winter snows and rose-red sunset fires—lakes drunken\r\nwith moonshine—all the delights of her lost paradise. She would not let\r\nherself think of Barney. Only of these lesser things. She could not\r\nendure to think of Barney.\r\n\r\nThen she thought of him inescapably. She ached for him. She wanted his\r\narms around her—his face against hers—his whispers in her ear. She\r\nrecalled all his friendly looks and quips and jests—his little\r\ncompliments—his caresses. She counted them all over as a woman might\r\ncount her jewels—not one did she miss from the first day they had met.\r\nThese memories were all she could have now. She shut her eyes and\r\nprayed.\r\n\r\n“Let me remember every one, God! Let me never forget one of them!”\r\n\r\nYet it would be better to forget. This agony of longing and loneliness\r\nwould not be so terrible if one could forget. And Ethel Traverse. That\r\nshimmering witch woman with her white skin and black eyes and shining\r\nhair. The woman Barney had loved. The woman whom he still loved. Hadn’t\r\nhe told her he never changed his mind? Who was waiting for him in\r\nMontreal. Who was the right wife for a rich and famous man. Barney\r\nwould marry her, of course, when he got his divorce. How Valancy hated\r\nher! And envied her! Barney had said, “I love you,” to _her_. Valancy\r\nhad wondered what tone Barney would say “I love you” in—how his\r\ndark-blue eyes would look when he said it. Ethel Traverse knew. Valancy\r\nhated her for the knowledge—hated and envied her.\r\n\r\n“She can never have those hours in the Blue Castle. They are _mine_,”\r\nthought Valancy savagely. Ethel would never make strawberry jam or\r\ndance to old Abel’s fiddle or fry bacon for Barney over a camp-fire.\r\nShe would never come to the little Mistawis shack at all.\r\n\r\nWhat was Barney doing—thinking—feeling now? Had he come home and found\r\nher letter? Was he still angry with her? Or a little pitiful. Was he\r\nlying on their bed looking out on stormy Mistawis and listening to the\r\nrain streaming down on the roof? Or was he still wandering in the\r\nwilderness, raging at the predicament in which he found himself? Hating\r\nher? Pain took her and wrung her like some great pitiless giant. She\r\ngot up and walked the floor. Would morning never come to end this\r\nhideous night? And yet what could morning bring her? The old life\r\nwithout the old stagnation that was at least bearable. The old life\r\nwith the new memories, the new longings, the new anguish.\r\n\r\n“Oh, why can’t I die?” moaned Valancy."

      "content": "It was not until early afternoon the next day that a dreadful old car\r\nclanked up Elm Street and stopped in front of the brick house. A\r\nhatless man sprang from it and rushed up the steps. The bell was rung\r\nas it had never been rung before—vehemently, intensely. The ringer was\r\ndemanding entrance, not asking it. Uncle Benjamin chuckled as he\r\nhurried to the door. Uncle Benjamin had “just dropped in” to enquire\r\nhow dear Doss—Valancy was. Dear Doss—Valancy, he had been informed, was\r\njust the same. She had come down for breakfast—which she didn’t\r\neat—gone back to her room, come down for dinner—which she didn’t\r\neat—gone back to her room. That was all. She had not talked. And she\r\nhad been let, kindly, considerately, alone.\r\n\r\n“Very good. Redfern will be here today,” said Uncle Benjamin. And now\r\nUncle Benjamin’s reputation as a prophet was made. Redfern was\r\nhere—unmistakably so.\r\n\r\n“Is my wife here?” he demanded of Uncle Benjamin without preface.\r\n\r\nUncle Benjamin smiled expressively.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Redfern, I believe? Very glad to meet you, sir. Yes, that naughty\r\nlittle girl of yours is here. We have been——”\r\n\r\n“I must see her,” Barney cut Uncle Benjamin ruthlessly short.\r\n\r\n“Certainly, Mr. Redfern. Just step in here. Valancy will be down in a\r\nminute.”\r\n\r\nHe ushered Barney into the parlour and betook himself to the\r\nsitting-room and Mrs. Frederick.\r\n\r\n“Go up and tell Valancy to come down. Her husband is here.”\r\n\r\nBut so dubious was Uncle Benjamin as to whether Valancy could really\r\ncome down in a minute—or at all—that he followed Mrs. Frederick on\r\ntiptoe up the stairs and listened in the hall.\r\n\r\n“Valancy dear,” said Mrs. Frederick tenderly, “your husband is in the\r\nparlour, asking for you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mother.” Valancy got up from the window and wrung her hands. “I\r\ncannot see him—I cannot! Tell him to go away—_ask_ him to go away. I\r\ncan’t see him!”\r\n\r\n“Tell her,” hissed Uncle Benjamin through the keyhole, “that Redfern\r\nsays he won’t go away until he _has_ seen her.”\r\n\r\nRedfern had not said anything of the kind, but Uncle Benjamin thought\r\nhe was that sort of a fellow. Valancy knew he was. She understood that\r\nshe might as well go down first as last.\r\n\r\nShe did not even look at Uncle Benjamin as she passed him on the\r\nlanding. Uncle Benjamin did not mind. Rubbing his hands and chuckling,\r\nhe retreated to the kitchen, where he genially demanded of Cousin\r\nStickles:\r\n\r\n“Why are good husbands like bread?”\r\n\r\nCousin Stickles asked why.\r\n\r\n“Because women need them,” beamed Uncle Benjamin.\r\n\r\nValancy was looking anything but beautiful when she entered the\r\nparlour. Her white night had played fearful havoc with her face. She\r\nwore an ugly old brown-and-blue gingham, having left all her pretty\r\ndresses in the Blue Castle. But Barney dashed across the room and\r\ncaught her in his arms.\r\n\r\n“Valancy, darling—oh, you darling little idiot! Whatever possessed you\r\nto run away like that? When I came home last night and found your\r\nletter I went quite mad. It was twelve o’clock—I knew it was too late\r\nto come here then. I walked the floor all night. Then this morning Dad\r\ncame—I couldn’t get away till now. Valancy, whatever got into you?\r\nDivorce, forsooth! Don’t you know——”\r\n\r\n“I know you only married me out of pity,” said Valancy, brushing him\r\naway feebly. “I know you don’t love me—I know——”\r\n\r\n“You’ve been lying awake at three o’clock too long,” said Barney,\r\nshaking her. “That’s all that’s the matter with you. Love you! Oh,\r\ndon’t I love you! My girl, when I saw that train coming down on you I\r\nknew whether I loved you or not!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I was afraid you would try to make me think you cared,” cried\r\nValancy passionately. “Don’t—don’t! I _know_. I know all about Ethel\r\nTraverse—your father told me everything. Oh, Barney, don’t torture me!\r\nI can never go back to you!”\r\n\r\nBarney released her and looked at her for a moment. Something in her\r\npallid, resolute face spoke more convincingly than words of her\r\ndetermination.\r\n\r\n“Valancy,” he said quietly, “Father couldn’t have told you everything\r\nbecause he didn’t know it. Will you let _me_ tell you—everything?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Valancy wearily. Oh, how dear he was! How she longed to\r\nthrow herself into his arms! As he put her gently down in a chair, she\r\ncould have kissed the slender, brown hands that touched her arms. She\r\ncould not look up as he stood before her. She dared not meet his eyes.\r\nFor his sake, she must be brave. She knew him—kind, unselfish. Of\r\ncourse he would pretend he did not want his freedom—she might have\r\nknown he would pretend that, once the first shock of realisation was\r\nover. He was so sorry for her—he understood her terrible position. When\r\nhad he ever failed to understand? But she would never accept his\r\nsacrifice. Never!\r\n\r\n“You’ve seen Dad and you know I’m Bernard Redfern. And I suppose you’ve\r\nguessed that I’m John Foster—since you went into Bluebeard’s Chamber.”\r\n\r\n“Yes. But I didn’t go in out of curiosity. I forgot you had told me not\r\nto go in—I forgot——”\r\n\r\n“Never mind. I’m not going to kill you and hang you up on the wall, so\r\nthere’s no need to call for Sister Anne. I’m only going to tell you my\r\nstory from the beginning. I came back last night intending to do it.\r\nYes, I’m ‘old Doc. Redfern’s son’—of Purple Pills and Bitters fame. Oh,\r\ndon’t I know it? Wasn’t it rubbed into me for years?”\r\n\r\nBarney laughed bitterly and strode up and down the room a few times.\r\nUncle Benjamin, tiptoeing through the hall, heard the laugh and\r\nfrowned. Surely Doss wasn’t going to be a stubborn little fool. Barney\r\nthrew himself into a chair before Valancy.\r\n\r\n“Yes. As long as I can remember I’ve been a millionaire’s son. But when\r\nI was born Dad wasn’t a millionaire. He wasn’t even a doctor—isn’t yet.\r\nHe was a veterinary and a failure at it. He and Mother lived in a\r\nlittle village up in Quebec and were abominably poor. I don’t remember\r\nMother. Haven’t even a picture of her. She died when I was two years\r\nold. She was fifteen years younger than Father—a little school teacher.\r\nWhen she died Dad moved into Montreal and formed a company to sell his\r\nhair tonic. He’d dreamed the prescription one night, it seems. Well, it\r\ncaught on. Money began to flow in. Dad invented—or dreamed—the other\r\nthings, too—Pills, Bitters, Liniment and so on. He was a millionaire by\r\nthe time I was ten, with a house so big a small chap like myself always\r\nfelt lost in it. I had every toy a boy could wish for—and I was the\r\nloneliest little devil in the world. I remember only one happy day in\r\nmy childhood, Valancy. Only one. Even you were better off than that.\r\nDad had gone out to see an old friend in the country and took me along.\r\nI was turned loose in the barnyard and I spent the whole day hammering\r\nnails in a block of wood. I had a glorious day. When I had to go back\r\nto my roomful of playthings in the big house in Montreal I cried. But I\r\ndidn’t tell Dad why. I never told him anything. It’s always been a hard\r\nthing for me to tell things, Valancy—anything that went deep. And most\r\nthings went deep with me. I was a sensitive child and I was even more\r\nsensitive as a boy. No one ever knew what I suffered. Dad never dreamed\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n“When he sent me to a private school—I was only eleven—the boys ducked\r\nme in the swimming-tank until I stood on a table and read aloud all the\r\nadvertisements of Father’s patent abominations. I did it—then”—Barney\r\nclinched his fists—“I was frightened and half drowned and all my world\r\nwas against me. But when I went to college and the sophs tried the same\r\nstunt I didn’t do it.” Barney smiled grimly. “They couldn’t make me do\r\nit. But they could—and did—make my life miserable. I never heard the\r\nlast of the Pills and the Bitters and the Hair Tonic. ‘After using’ was\r\nmy nickname—you see I’d always such a thick thatch. My four college\r\nyears were a nightmare. You know—or you don’t know—what merciless\r\nbeasts boys can be when they get a victim like me. I had few\r\nfriends—there was always some barrier between me and the kind of people\r\nI cared for. And the other kind—who would have been very willing to be\r\nintimate with rich old Doc. Redfern’s son—I didn’t care for. But I had\r\none friend—or thought I had. A clever, bookish chap—a bit of a writer.\r\nThat was a bond between us—I had some secret aspirations along that\r\nline. He was older than I was—I looked up to him and worshipped him.\r\nFor a year I was happier than I’d ever been. Then—a burlesque sketch\r\ncame out in the college magazine—a mordant thing, ridiculing Dad’s\r\nremedies. The names were changed, of course, but everybody knew what\r\nand who was meant. Oh, it was clever—damnably so—and witty. McGill\r\nrocked with laughter over it. I found out _he_ had written it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, were you sure?” Valancy’s dull eyes flamed with indignation.\r\n\r\n“Yes. He admitted it when I asked him. Said a good idea was worth more\r\nto him than a friend, any time. And he added a gratuitous thrust. ‘You\r\nknow, Redfern, there are some things money won’t buy. For instance—it\r\nwon’t buy you a grandfather.’ Well, it was a nasty slam. I was young\r\nenough to feel cut up. And it destroyed a lot of my ideals and\r\nillusions, which was the worst thing about it. I was a young\r\nmisanthrope after that. Didn’t want to be friends with any one. And\r\nthen—the year after I left college—I met Ethel Traverse.”\r\n\r\nValancy shivered. Barney, his hands stuck in his pockets, was regarding\r\nthe floor moodily and didn’t notice it.\r\n\r\n“Dad told you about her, I suppose. She was very beautiful. And I loved\r\nher. Oh, yes, I loved her. I won’t deny it or belittle it now. It was a\r\nlonely, romantic boy’s first passionate love, and it was very real. And\r\nI thought she loved me. I was fool enough to think that. I was wildly\r\nhappy when she promised to marry me. For a few months. Then—I found out\r\nshe didn’t. I was an involuntary eavesdropper on a certain occasion for\r\na moment. That moment was enough. The proverbial fate of the\r\neavesdropper overtook me. A girl friend of hers was asking her how she\r\ncould stomach Doc. Redfern’s son and the patent-medicine background.\r\n\r\n“‘His money will gild the Pills and sweeten the Bitters,’ said Ethel,\r\nwith a laugh. ‘Mother told me to catch him if I could. We’re on the\r\nrocks. But pah! I smell turpentine whenever he comes near me.’”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Barney!” cried Valancy, wrung with pity for him. She had forgotten\r\nall about herself and was filled with compassion for Barney and rage\r\nagainst Ethel Traverse. How dared she?\r\n\r\n“Well,”—Barney got up and began pacing round the room—“that finished\r\nme. Completely. I left civilisation and those accursed dopes behind me\r\nand went to the Yukon. For five years I knocked about the world—in all\r\nsorts of outlandish places. I earned enough to live on—I wouldn’t touch\r\na cent of Dad’s money. Then one day I woke up to the fact that I no\r\nlonger cared a hang about Ethel, one way or another. She was somebody\r\nI’d known in another world—that was all. But I had no hankering to go\r\nback to the old life. None of that for me. I was free and I meant to\r\nkeep so. I came to Mistawis—saw Tom MacMurray’s island. My first book\r\nhad been published the year before, and made a hit—I had a bit of money\r\nfrom my royalties. I bought my island. But I kept away from people. I\r\nhad no faith in anybody. I didn’t believe there was such a thing as\r\nreal friendship or true love in the world—not for me, anyhow—the son of\r\nPurple Pills. I used to revel in all the wild yarns they told of me. In\r\nfact, I’m afraid I suggested a few of them myself. By mysterious\r\nremarks which people interpreted in the light of their own\r\nprepossessions.\r\n\r\n“Then—you came. I _had_ to believe you loved me—really loved _me_—not\r\nmy father’s millions. There was no other reason why you should want to\r\nmarry a penniless devil with my supposed record. And I was sorry for\r\nyou. Oh, yes, I don’t deny I married you because I was sorry for you.\r\nAnd then—I found you the best and jolliest and dearest little pal and\r\nchum a fellow ever had. Witty—loyal—sweet. You made me believe again in\r\nthe reality of friendship and love. The world seemed good again just\r\nbecause you were in it, honey. I’d have been willing to go on forever\r\njust as we were. I knew that, the night I came home and saw my\r\nhomelight shining out from the island for the first time. And knew you\r\nwere there waiting for me. After being homeless all my life it was\r\nbeautiful to have a home. To come home hungry at night and know there\r\nwas a good supper and a cheery fire—and _you_.\r\n\r\n“But I didn’t realise what you actually meant to me till that moment at\r\nthe switch. Then it came like a lightning flash. I knew I couldn’t live\r\nwithout you—that if I couldn’t pull you loose in time I’d have to die\r\nwith you. I admit it bowled me over—knocked me silly. I couldn’t get my\r\nbearings for a while. That’s why I acted like a mule. But the thought\r\nthat drove me to the tall timber was the awful one that you were going\r\nto die. I’d always hated the thought of it—but I supposed there wasn’t\r\nany chance for you, so I put it out of my mind. Now I had to face\r\nit—you were under sentence of death and I couldn’t live without you.\r\nWhen I came home last night I had made up my mind that I’d take you to\r\nall the specialists in the world—that something surely could be done\r\nfor you. I felt sure you couldn’t be as bad as Dr. Trent thought, when\r\nthose moments on the track hadn’t even hurt you. And I found your\r\nnote—and went mad with happiness—and a little terror for fear you\r\ndidn’t care much for me, after all, and had gone away to get rid of me.\r\nBut now, it’s all right, isn’t it, darling?”\r\n\r\nWas she, Valancy being called “darling”?\r\n\r\n“I _can’t_ believe you care for me,” she said helplessly. “I _know_ you\r\ncan’t. What’s the use, Barney? Of course, you’re sorry for me—of course\r\nyou want to do the best you can to straighten out the mess. But it\r\ncan’t be straightened out that way. You couldn’t love me—me.” She stood\r\nup and pointed tragically to the mirror over the mantel. Certainly, not\r\neven Allan Tierney could have seen beauty in the woeful, haggard little\r\nface reflected there.\r\n\r\nBarney didn’t look at the mirror. He looked at Valancy as if he would\r\nlike to snatch her—or beat her.\r\n\r\n“Love you! Girl, you’re in the very core of my heart. I hold you there\r\nlike a jewel. Didn’t I promise you I’d never tell you a lie? Love you!\r\nI love you with all there is of me to love. Heart, soul, brain. Every\r\nfibre of body and spirit thrilling to the sweetness of you. There’s\r\nnobody in the world for me but you, Valancy.”\r\n\r\n“You’re—a good actor, Barney,” said Valancy, with a wan little smile.\r\n\r\nBarney looked at her.\r\n\r\n“So you don’t believe me—yet?”\r\n\r\n“I—can’t.”\r\n\r\n“Oh—damn!” said Barney violently.\r\n\r\nValancy looked up startled. She had never seen _this_ Barney. Scowling!\r\nEyes black with anger. Sneering lips. Dead-white face.\r\n\r\n“You don’t want to believe it,” said Barney in the silk-smooth voice of\r\nultimate rage. “You’re tired of me. You want to get out of it—free from\r\nme. You’re ashamed of the Pills and the Liniment, just as she was. Your\r\nStirling pride can’t stomach them. It was all right as long as you\r\nthought you hadn’t long to live. A good lark—you could put up with me.\r\nBut a lifetime with old Doc Redfern’s son is a different thing. Oh, I\r\nunderstand—perfectly. I’ve been very dense—but I understand, at last.”\r\n\r\nValancy stood up. She stared into his furious face. Then—she suddenly\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n“You darling!” she said. “You do mean it! You do really love me! You\r\nwouldn’t be so enraged if you didn’t.”\r\n\r\nBarney stared at her for a moment. Then he caught her in his arms with\r\nthe little low laugh of the triumphant lover.\r\n\r\nUncle Benjamin, who had been frozen with horror at the keyhole,\r\nsuddenly thawed out and tiptoed back to Mrs. Frederick and Cousin\r\nStickles.\r\n\r\n“Everything is all right,” he announced jubilantly.\r\n\r\nDear little Doss! He would send for his lawyer right away and alter his\r\nwill again. Doss should be his sole heiress. To her that had should\r\ncertainly be given.\r\n\r\nMrs. Frederick, returning to her comfortable belief in an overruling\r\nProvidence, got out the family Bible and made an entry under\r\n“Marriages.”"

Dad holds the championship for making blunders. If there’s a\r\nthing that’s better left unsaid you can trust him to say it. But he\r\nisn’t a bad old soul, Valancy. You’ll like him.”\r\n\r\n“I do, now.”\r\n\r\n“And his money isn’t tainted money. He made it honestly. His medicines\r\nare quite harmless. Even his Purple Pills do people whole heaps of good\r\nwhen they believe in them.”\r\n\r\n“But—I’m not fit for your life,” sighed Valancy. “I’m not—clever—or\r\nwell-educated—or——”\r\n\r\n“My life is in Mistawis—and all the wild places of the world. I’m not\r\ngoing to ask you to live the life of a society woman. Of course, we\r\nmust spend a bit of the time with Dad—he’s lonely and old——”\r\n\r\n“But not in that big house of his,” pleaded Valancy. “I can’t live in a\r\npalace.”\r\n\r\n“Can’t come down to that after your Blue Castle,” grinned Barney.\r\n“Don’t worry, sweet. I couldn’t live in that house myself. It has a\r\nwhite marble stairway with gilt bannisters and looks like a furniture\r\nshop with the labels off. Likewise it’s the pride of Dad’s heart. We’ll\r\nget a little house somewhere outside of Montreal—in the real\r\ncountry—near enough to see Dad often. I think we’ll build one for\r\nourselves. A house you build for yourself is so much nicer than a\r\nhand-me-down. But we’ll spend our summers in Mistawis. And our autumns\r\ntravelling. I want you to see the Alhambra—it’s the nearest thing to\r\nthe Blue Castle of your dreams I can think of. And there’s an old-world\r\ngarden in Italy where I want to show you the moon rising over Rome\r\nthrough the dark cypress-trees.”\r\n\r\n“Will that be any lovelier than the moon rising over Mistawis?”\r\n\r\n“Not lovelier. But a different kind of loveliness. There are so many\r\nkinds of loveliness. Valancy, before this year you’ve spent all your\r\nlife in ugliness. You know nothing of the beauty of the world. We’ll\r\nclimb mountains—hunt for treasures in the bazaars of Samarcand—search\r\nout the magic of east and west—run hand in hand to the rim of the\r\nworld. I want to show you it all—see it again through your eyes. Girl,\r\nthere are a million things I want to show you—do with you—say to you.\r\nIt will take a lifetime. And we must see about that picture by Tierney,\r\nafter all.”\r\n\r\n“Will you promise me one thing?” asked Valancy solemnly.\r\n\r\n“Anything,” said Barney recklessly.\r\n\r\n“Only one thing. You are never, under any circumstances or under any\r\nprovocation, to cast it up to me that I asked you to marry me.”"

The fuss they all make\r\nover Doss now is absolutely sickening.
